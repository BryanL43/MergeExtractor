BACKGROUND
TO THE PROPOSED BUYOUT

was founded in 1938 in Oakland, California. Longs operates in two business
segments: retail drug stores and, through its RxAmerica subsidiary, pharmacy
benefit services. Longs is one of the most recognized retail drug store chains
on the West Coast and in Hawaii, with 510 stores as of January 31,
April 2008, Walgreens’ CEO contacted defendant Bryant to discuss a potential
informed Walgreens’ CEO that they only way the Board would even consider a
transaction with Walgreens was if Walgreens shouldered all regulatory risk.
Walgreens’ CEO told Bryant that Walgreens’ could only agree to such an
arrangement if it was provided with the necessary due diligence to investigate
the level of regulatory risk presented by a proposed merger between Longs and
April 24, 2008, Walgreens’ CEO again contacted defendant Bryant and raised its
indication of interest to $67-$70 per share, but reiterated its position that it
needed to conduct due diligence before agreeing to shoulder the regulatory risk
in a merger with Longs.
subsequent conversations between April 26, 2008 and May 17, 2008, Walgreens’ CEO
reiterated its request for due diligence so it could assess potential regulatory
risk, and requested that Longs enter into a joint defense agreement that would
allow Walgreens access to confidential Company information. The Board eventually
agreed to do so, and provided Walgreens with some due diligence information over
44.           Beginning
around June 11, 2008, Bryant had preliminary discussions with CVS about a
potential merger. Two days later, Walgreens’ CEO contacted Bryant to discuss
merger provisions that would shift some of the risk of regulatory approval to
Longs. These discussions never moved forward,

ABETTING

and on
July 11, 2008, Walgreens informed Bryant that it was no longer interested in a
transaction with Longs because of, among other things, the failure of Longs to
engage in good faith negotiations around the issue of regulatory
the Board negotiated exclusively with CVS, and, even though the Board had failed
to engage Walgreens in a competitive process despite numerous opportunities to
do so and maximize shareholder value, did not subsequently reach out to any
other interested bidders to solicit bids to compete with CVS.
announced that it had built up an 8.8% stake in the Company, and that it may
engage the Company in discussions. Pershing further stated that it had purchased
total return swaps to bring its total economic interest in Longs to 15.4%. After
the Proposed Buyout was announced, Pershing executed these swaps and now holds a
announcement effectively put the Company “in play,” and susceptible to offers
from potentially interested bidders. The Board did not take the opportunity to
conduct a full and fair auction for the Company presented by Pershing’s
announcement, however. Instead, the Board entered into the Proposed Buyout just
one week later, catering the entire process to the interests of CVS and
eschewing any attempt to maximize shareholder value.
August 11, 2008, the Board agreed to the Proposed Buyout based in large part on

THE
PROPOSED BUYOUT

August 12, 2008, the Company announced that it had entered into a merger
agreement with CVS. As the joint press release stated:
CVS
Caremark Corporation and Longs Drug Stores Corporation today announced that they
have entered into a definitive agreement under which CVS Caremark will acquire
including the assumption of net debt. Through this acquisition, CVS Caremark
will acquire Longs’ 521 retail drugstores in California, Hawaii, Nevada and
Arizona as well as its Rx America subsidiary, which offers prescription benefits
management (“PBM”) services to over 8 million members and prescription drug plan
benefits to approximately 450,000 Medicare beneficiaries.

The addition of Longs’ valuable store
locations in Central and Northern California, Hawaii, and Nevada will provide
CVS Caremark with substantial market

positions
in these highly attractive, fast growing markets. Further, the acquisition
complements CVS Caremark’s substantial presence in Southern California and
provides a foundation for significant future growth throughout the nation’s
largest state. The transaction also offers CVS Caremark immediate market
leadership in the highly attractive Hawaiian market, where it currently does not
have a presence, as well as high-quality locations in Nevada and

Significantly, Longs owns the real
estate associated with approximately 200 store locations, three distribution
centers and three office facilities. CVS Caremark has conservatively valued the
store locations alone at more than $1 billion. These stores are located in
markets where commercial real estate values are among the highest in the country
and prime locations are especially difficult to acquire. CVS Caremark intends to
unlock the intrinsic value of these locations, as well as the distribution
centers and office facilities, by monetizing a substantial portion of these

Caremark will be in a stronger position as it rolls out its new suite of
offerings under the Proactive Pharmacy Care model, taking advantage of its

of CVS Caremark, commented, “This transaction provides tremendous benefits to
CVS Caremark by accelerating our expansion in very attractive drugstore markets
and strengthening our geographic reach. In fact, Longs has a significant
presence in ten non-CVS markets that are among the top 100 drugstore markets in
the country. More than 490 of the stores we are acquiring are located in the
Central and Northern California and Hawaiian markets, where Longs is a leading
player. Longs’ store network in these regions is excellent and is one that would
take a decade or more for us to replicate through organic growth.

increase accessibility to our pharmacies for consumers and put us in an even
better position to grow our new Proactive Pharmacy Care offerings with our PBM
clients. We are very excited about the potential offered by this combination and
the opportunity to build on our strong track record of acquiring and
successfully integrating PBMs and retail drugstore chains, and we expect this
integration to be seamless.

impressed with the strong customer loyalty Longs’ employees have earned
throughout the West Coast and Hawaii, as well as the high quality of Longs’
stores in these markets. We look forward to completing the transaction and
welcoming the talented Longs associates to our company,” Mr. Ryan

and Chief Executive Officer of Longs, stated, “The transaction represents an
excellent opportunity for Longs to deliver significant and certain value to its
shareholders while positioning its stores to thrive in the future for the
benefit of its employees and customers.

“Over the course of the last five
years, we have transformed Longs into a stronger, more productive, more
profitable company. Given the changing industry landscape, we believe this
combination is the logical next step for Longs. CVS Caremark has a strong record
of successfully integrating drug store chains and pharmacy benefit services into
its portfolio and working with employees to strengthen the performance, format
and offerings of stores. We believe this will present excellent opportunities
for our employees and ensure that our customers continue to receive excellent
pharmacy care and high quality products.”

ABETTING

Longs generates annual revenues in
excess of $5 billion, consistently strong operating cash flow, and reported
EBITDA in the last 12 months of approximately $276 million. Assuming completion
of the transaction in the fourth quarter of 2008, the acquisition is expected to
be dilutive to earnings per share in the first year, and accretive to EPS
beginning in 2010. CVS Caremark expects to achieve significant cost synergies of
resulting from purchasing efficiencies and a reduction of SG&A

The combination will expand CVS
the acquisition, CVS Caremark will fill or manage more than 1.2 billion
prescriptions per year and will operate approximately 6,800 drugstores in 41
states and the District of Columbia.

The acquisition will be effected
through a tender offer to be launched shortly by a subsidiary of CVS Caremark
for all outstanding Longs shares. The tender offer will be subject to, among
other things, the condition that at least two-thirds of the outstanding Longs
shares are tendered.

CVS Caremark plans to finance the
acquisition with a $1.5 billion bridge loan facility, together with existing
cash and liquidity, which will provide CVS Caremark with funding sufficient to
satisfy its obligations for the acquisition. The transaction is subject to
review under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act and has other customary closing
conditions. It is expected to be completed in the fourth quarter of

a result of the Proposed Buyout, shareholders will be unable to share in the
long-term gains the Company is likely to achieve. Moreover, the consideration
offered in the Proposed Buyout does not provide shareholders with fair value for
the cost and revenue synergies that will flow to CVS via the Proposed
51.           Defendants
concede that the Proposed Buyout will generate tremendous synergies for CVS. On
Conference Call on August 12, 2008, CVS’s Chairman and CEO stated the following
regarding the Proposed Buyout:

know, California is the most populous state with 36 million plus people adding
this transaction, we will have over 830 stores in the state. More than anybody

Our experience, as well as others in
the real estate business, have proven that site selection and development in
Northern and Central California markets as well as Hawaii is pretty costly and
very time consuming. And this is as evidenced by the limited amount of
development. Many of these markets are mature with a minimum supply of
appropriate drug store sites. We estimate that the timeframe needed to assemble

of sites, even if they become available, are time consuming, because of complex
zoning and entitlement issues and significant capital investment. Consequently,

valuable well located sites. In fact, these sites – these stores will give us a

Francisco and Honolulu, just for an example.

In addition to California and Hawaii,
we’ll also add 24 stores in Nevada and a couple of stores in Arizona. We will
gain leadership in the Reno, Nevada market, where we currently only have three
stores. And this market’s projected to grow twice the annual average growth rate
of the rest of the country.

About 470 of those stores we are
stores that size. And the rest of the stores – the rest of the Longs’ stores are
smaller stores in the 4,000 to 7,000 square foot range. And these are located
to put our specialty pharmacy in these stores.

It’s important also to note that Longs
owns the real estate associated with approximately 200 plus store locations,
three distribution centers and three office facilities. We have valued these
store locations alone at more than $1 billion.

As noted earlier, these stores are
located in markets, where commercial real estate and values are among the
highest in the country and prime locations are difficult to acquire. We intend
to unlock the intrinsic value of these locations as well as distribution centers
and office facilities by monetizing a substantial portion of these assets over
time. In addition, Longs’ distribution centers will be valuable additions to our
distribution network.

also operates a PBM, RxAmerica, which serves about 8.5 million commercial lives
and it has a Med. D standalone PDP that insures about 450,000 lives. The PBM
generates about $380 million in annual revenue, including the PDP lives. CVS
Caremark will insure over 1.5 million lives through the PDP plans. We will
integrate RxAmerica’s PBM and PDP business over time. And it will be a nice
complement to our PBM.

Let me talk a little bit about the
financials. Longs generates approximately $5 billion in annual revenues and a
reported EBITDA in the last 12 months of $276 million. So, this transaction is
priced at approximately 10 times EBITDA, which is roughly what we paid for the
Osco Sav-On stores in 2006. The company has a consistent cash flow generator,
reporting operating cash flow of about $200 million annually.

In terms of synergies, we are currently
anticipating cost synergies of $100 million in ‘09 an approximately $140 million

To me, the acquisition of Longs
provides important strategic and financial benefits for us both in the near and
the long term. One, we’re accelerating our growth into key new markets that are
difficult to enter. Two, we’re broadening our geographic reach that will help us
facilitate the rollout of our new Proactive Pharmacy Care offerings. Three,
together with the management team of Longs and the CVS management team, we
believe, we can improve the performance of the stores with our technology, our

we’ve ever missed our projections on acquisition, either on the revenue side or
the synergy side. So, we take a fairly conservative approach.

53.           Certain
of the Company’s large shareholders, including Pershing, have publicly taken the
position since the Proposed Buyout was announced that the consideration offered
does not adequately value the Company, especially its expansive real estate
interests. In fact, as reported in a news article entitled “Pershing Hires
Blackstone to Boost Longs Price,” Pershing has hired its own financial advisor
to evaluate the Proposed Buyout:

SUMMARY OF THE
ACTION

class action, filed on behalf of the public shareholders of Longs, is brought
against the Company, Longs Directors (as defined below) and CVS Caremark to
enjoin an unlawful plan through which CVS Caremark would acquire all shares of
material disclosures, for inadequate consideration and under circumstances
unfair to the Class.
12, 2008, Longs entered into an agreement to be acquired by CVS Caremark for
approximately $2.9 billion via tender offer. As CVS Caremark Chief Executive
the Proposed Transaction, Longs’ real estate assets are a key component of the
transaction and a substantial expected benefit to CVS Caremark.  Ryan
stated publicly that Longs’ real estate assets are worth a conservative estimate
of $1 billion, which CVS Caremark would be able to monetize to its
Proposed Transaction was announced and CVS Caremark CEO Ryan made his remarks,
several major shareholders of Longs started to question whether the true value
of Longs’ real estate assets was actually far higher.  Indeed, one
reported that it had conducted its own market research and that Longs’ real
estate assets were worth significantly more than $1 billion.

prior to
voting its shares.  However, the Chairman of Advisory Research was
told directly by Longs’ CEO Warren Bryant that Longs signed an
agreement with CVS Caremark that it would not reveal the value of its real
estate assets.  In other words, Longs shareholders are being
asked to make the most important, fundamental decision – whether to
relinquish their shares in exchange for cash – without the
benefit of necessary material information to which they are
addition, the agreement entered into between Longs, CVS Caremark and Blue
MergerSub erects several barriers meant to deter competing bids and to prevent
Longs shareholders from receiving full value for their shares.  For
example, even if Longs were to receive a superior bid for the Company, Longs would be
required to pay CVS Caremark a break-up fee of $115 million, or an astounding
the Longs Directors structured the Proposed Transaction so that CVS Caremark
need not comply with the usual corporate formalities that go along with the
significant “deal protections” in the Proposed Transaction, the Longs Directors
have granted a “top-up” option to CVS Caremark that allows CVS Caremark to
complete a “short form” merger even it never pays a price sufficient to obtain
CVS Caremark to pay the lowest possible price necessary to get the required
merger.  Inclusion of this provision makes clear the parties’ intent
to avoid applicable shareholder voting protections at the expense of Longs
Plaintiff and the other Class members face certain and irreparable harm if the
Proposed Transaction is allowed to proceed, or if Plaintiff and the other Class
members are forced to evaluate the Proposed Transaction without necessary
material information to assess the value of the Acquisition
Proposal.  As such, Plaintiff, on behalf of itself and the other Class
members, respectfully requests the Court to enjoin the Proposed Transaction, as
Plaintiff and the other Class members have no adequate remedy at

JURISDICTION
AND VENUE
  This
Court has jurisdiction over all causes of action asserted herein pursuant to
§ 410.10 of the California Code of Civil Procedure and § 2116 of the
California Corporations Code. 
 This
Court has jurisdiction over each defendant named herein because each defendant
is either a corporation that does sufficient business in California, or an
individual who has sufficient minimum contacts with California, to render the
exercise of jurisdiction by the California courts permissible under traditional
notions of fair play and substantial justice.  All of the defendants
conduct business and/or maintain offices in California, and Longs’ headquarters
and its principal place of business is located in Walnut Creek, Contra Costa
County, California.  Also, many of the Individual Defendants reside in
proper in this Court because a substantial portion of the wrongs complained of
herein, including the defendants’ primary participation in the wrongful acts
detailed herein in violation of their fiduciary duties, occurred in Contra Costa
County, and the defendants have received substantial compensation in Contra
Costa County by doing business here and engaging in numerous activities which
had an effect in this County.  Venue is also proper in this Court
because many of those affected by defendants’ conduct reside in this County, and
many of the potential witnesses reside or work in this County.

to a total purchase price of $2.9 billion.  The announcement
highlights the benefits flowing to CVS (the “Proposed Transaction” or the

The
addition of Longs’ valuable store locations in Central and Northern California,
Hawaii, and Nevada will provide CVS Caremark with substantial market positions
in these highly attractive, fast growing markets.  Further, the
acquisition complements CVS Caremark’s substantial presence in Southern
California and provides a foundation for significant future growth throughout
the nation’s largest state.  The transaction also offers CVS Caremark
immediate market leadership in the highly attractive Hawaiian market, where it
currently does not have a presence, as well as high-quality locations in Nevada

Longs owns the real estate associated with approximately 200 store locations,
three distribution centers and three office facilities.  CVS Caremark
has conservatively valued the store locations alone at more than $1
billion. These stores are located in markets where commercial real estate
values are among the highest in the country and prime locations are especially
difficult to acquire. CVS Caremark
intends to unlock the intrinsic value of these locations, as well as the
distribution centers and office facilities, by monetizing a substantial portion
of these assets over time.

Tom
provides tremendous benefits to CVS Caremark by accelerating our expansion in
very attractive drugstore markets and strengthening our geographic
reach.  In fact, Longs has a significant presence in ten non-CVS
markets that are among the top 100 drugstore markets in the country. More than
490 of the stores we are acquiring are located in the Central and Northern
California and Hawaiian markets, where Longs is a leading
player.  Longs’ store network in these regions is excellent and is one

of these potentially conflicting assertions, and the absence of any substantive

The Solicitation is Vague
and Misleading in Numerous Other Respects

 Besides
omitting material information related to the worth of the Company’s most basic
asset, its real estate holdings – the value of which Longs Directors agreed to
withhold from shareholders – the Solicitation is materially misleading regarding
other information of necessary disclosure to Longs
shareholders.  Furthermore, the Solicitation is too vague to afford
Longs shareholders the opportunity to evaluate adequately the fairness of the
Acquisition Proposal and the process that led to the Agreement and Plan of
 For
example, the Solicitation expounds at great length on prior negotiations with a
Walgreens Co., based on information provided in certain news reports regarding
the Proposed Transaction.) Disclosures regarding the depth and breadth of any
bidding process are important to shareholders when assessing whether to trust
the recommendation of the Longs Directors.
 The
seemingly extensive and detailed discussions in the Solicitation regarding
numerous conversations between “Party A” and Longs included the disclosure that
agreed to engage in due diligence.  Similarly, the Solicitation
related that in June 2008, CVS Caremark and Longs entered into a confidentiality
agreement before embarking on the due diligence that resulted in the Agreement
 The
disclosures in the Solicitation imply that both “Party A” and CVS Caremark were
treated equally in terms of performing due diligence and preparing bids for
Longs.  However, the Solicitation remains vague as to whether, in
business, financial prospects, and real estate holdings – as CVS Caremark
eventually did – or if the due
diligence performed by “Party A” related only to the regulatory concerns that
caused negotiations to terminate.

 The
extent and nature of the due diligence performed by “Party A” is necessary

Longs shareholders cannot evaluate the Proposed Transaction adequately until the
Company makes clear to its shareholders whether only one of the interested
bidders was actually fully engaged in the bidding process for Longs.

Provisions in the Agreement
and Plan of Merger Pose Significant Barriers to Longs Directors Fulfilling Their
Fiduciary Duties

 The terms
of the Agreement and Plan of Merger are meant to deter competing bids and
prevent the Longs Directors from exercising their fiduciary duties to obtain the
best available price for Longs shareholders.  The defensive provisions
erect barriers to competing offers and function to substantially increase the
likelihood that the Proposed Transaction will be consummated, and cannot be
justified as an appropriate and proportionate response to any reasonable threat
posed to Longs shareholders.
 $115 Million Termination
Fee: The Agreement and Plan of Merger requires Longs to pay to CVS
Caremark the sum of $115 million in cash if Longs terminates the Agreement and
4.5% of the equity value of the deal, which is excessive and unreasonable under
the circumstances and acts to punish Longs shareholders and the Longs Directors
for simply pursuing more attractive alternatives, while also deterring such
alternatives from emerging.

merger to follow.  A tender offer can close in as little as 20
days.  As such, CVS Caremark has avoided the usual time period
necessary for a shareholder vote to be scheduled and completed.

CLASS ACTION
      COMPLAINT 


 This
typical time period not only allows for competing bidders to emerge – itself an
important assurance to investors that the price offered is the highest price
available – but it also gives
shareholders a chance to assess the performance of the board, including the
negotiation of the merger agreement, and to resist the deal if the shareholders
are dissatisfied with the board’s performance.  But the Longs
Directors structured the deal so that CVS Caremark need not comply with the
usual corporate formalities that go along with the usual third-party
merger.  In fact, the Longs Directors neglected to play even a passive
role, where they would step aside so that CVS could make an offer directly to
shareholders and let the market decide the Company’s

in addition to granting significant “deal protections” in the merger agreement,
the Longs Directors have granted a “top-up option” to CVS Caremark that allows
CVS Caremark to complete a “short form” merger even if it never pays a price
sufficient to obtain 90% of the Company’s outstanding shares.
 The law
treats corporate acquirers very differently when they acquire less than 90% of
the outstanding shares and when they pay a sufficient price to acquire over 90%
of the Company’s outstanding shares.  If a controlling shareholder or
a third party pays a sufficiently high price to acquire a 90% stake in a target
corporation, the acquirer is rewarded with the ability to effectuate a “short
form merger,” meaning that it need only file a certificate of merger without the
action of any shareholders or the board of the target.
Longs Directors have granted to CVS Caremark a “top-up option” that allows CVS
shares, but then enjoy the benefits of a short form merger.  According
to Section 2.04 of the Merger Agreement, provided CVS Caremark obtains just
option that results in Longs issuing brand new shares – diluting the existing
shareholders – at a level
sufficient to let CVS Caremark end up with over 90% of the Company’s outstanding

      experienced in litigation of this nature.  Plaintiff’s claims
      are typical of the claims of the other members of the Class and Plaintiff

      Class.  Accordingly, Plaintiff is adequately representative of
      the Class and will fairly and adequately protect the interests of the


The
      prosecution of separate actions by individual members of the Class would create the risk of inconsistent or varying
      adjudications with respect to individual members of the Class, which would
      establish incompatible standards of conduct for defendants, or
      adjudications with respect to individual members of the Class which would,
      as a practical matter, be dispositive of the interests of the other
      members not parties to the adjudications or substantially impair or impede
      their ability to protect their interests.


 To the extent
      defendants take further steps to effectuate the Proposed Acquisition,
      preliminary and final injunctive relief on behalf of the Class as a whole
      will be entirely appropriate because defendants have acted, or refused to
