**BACKGROUND TO THE MERGER**

Beginning in the fall of 1999, Heartport's management and board of directors began discussing the possibility of finding a strategic business partner for the purposes of:

- leveraging Heartport's products through a larger, more established sales organization
- gaining greater market share in the beating heart surgical market utilizing an established sales organization
- gaining greater protection of intellectual property rights and
- gaining greater access to capital to fund operational growth and key product development initiatives.

On November 19, 1999, the Heartport board of directors discussed the need to engage an independent financial advisor to assist Heartport in finding a strategic business partner. On December 9, 1999, Heartport engaged Morgan Stanley & Co. Incorporated to:

- assist Heartport in identifying and evaluating candidates for a potential sale or merger
- contact potential candidates which Heartport and Morgan Stanley believed to be appropriate for a sale or merger and
- meet with and interact with potential candidates in the context of assisting Heartport in evaluating and negotiating a potential sale or merger.

Subsequent to December 9, 1999, Morgan Stanley conducted an auction process for Heartport. Initially, Morgan Stanley strategically targeted two companies, including Johnson & Johnson. Both companies expressed initial interest in the proposal and formally began discussions with Heartport under confidentiality agreements that had been entered into with Heartport earlier in the fall of 1999. Senior members of Heartport's management and representatives of Morgan Stanley sent descriptive materials regarding Heartport to each of the two companies.

On January 20, 2000, Morgan Stanley presented to the Heartport board of directors an initial overview of the two interested companies. Between January 2000 and March 2000, senior members of Heartport's management and representatives of Morgan Stanley held due diligence meetings and conference calls with Johnson & Johnson and the other company. After a lengthy due diligence process, Johnson & Johnson and the other company both withdrew from bidding for reasons related to valuation.

During March 2000, senior management of Heartport and representatives of Morgan Stanley contacted four additional companies to ascertain their interest with respect to a potential business combination. Each of these companies showed little interest.

Between March 2000 and January 2001, Heartport's management and Morgan Stanley conducted ongoing discussions regarding potential strategic and financing alternatives.

On March 23, 2000, the Heartport board of directors discussed the viability of other strategic alternatives in the event that an acceptable business combination transaction could not be achieved.

In the first week of January 2001, Heartport received an unsolicited oral offer from Johnson & Johnson to exchange shares of Johnson & Johnson common stock for shares of Heartport common stock at a specified value. Heartport evaluated this offer and eventually rejected the offer based upon valuation.

Johnson & Johnson responded on or about January 12, 2001 by orally offering to discuss a higher valuation and requesting that Johnson & Johnson and Heartport continue discussions. Due diligence meetings and conference calls between Heartport and Johnson & Johnson resumed.

Between January 12, 2001 and January 25, 2001, Johnson & Johnson and Heartport engaged in several conference calls and other due diligence activities. Simultaneously, Heartport, Johnson & Johnson and their respective legal counsel engaged in contract negotiations for the proposed acquisition of Heartport by Johnson & Johnson, subject to the companies coming to an agreement as to valuation.

During the week of January 15, 2001, Morgan Stanley, on behalf of Heartport, contacted other companies to ascertain interest levels with respect to a potential business combination transaction with Heartport.

On January 24, 2001, a company made an oral offer for each outstanding share of Heartport common stock, subject to a full due diligence review being completed by that company. This offer was rejected due to its low valuation in comparison to the expected value of the forthcoming Johnson & Johnson bid.

On January 24, 2001, the Heartport board of directors met to discuss the proposed merger with Johnson & Johnson. Morgan Stanley presented its assessment of the transaction in view of other prospects for a merger and presented its opinion that the consideration offered by Johnson & Johnson was fair from a financial point of view. The Heartport board of directors extensively discussed the proposed merger and authorized management to continue discussions regarding the terms and conditions of the proposed merger.

On January 25, 2001, Johnson & Johnson submitted a final offer to Heartport of $2.72 for each outstanding share of Heartport common stock, or approximately $81 million in the aggregate, to be paid in Johnson & Johnson common stock.

Johnson & Johnson's offer was subject to certain conditions, including the following:

- Heartport's directors and executive officers and their affiliates entering into a stockholder agreement with Johnson & Johnson pursuant to which such stockholders would agree to vote in favor of a merger with Johnson & Johnson
- Heartport agreeing that neither it nor any of its officers, directors, employees or agents would solicit, initiate or encourage competing offers to purchase Heartport or a substantial portion of its business; provided, however, that legitimate unsolicited offers could be considered pursuant to the board's fiduciary responsibility to Heartport's stockholders, subject to Heartport's compliance with the specific provisions in the merger agreement relating to this matter, and
- the stockholders entering into the stockholder agreement agreeing to the profit recoupment provisions described on page 45 below under "The Stockholder Agreement -- Profit Recoupment Provisions".

On January 25, 2001, the Heartport board of directors met again with representatives from Morgan Stanley and Heartport's legal counsel. The Heartport board of directors entered into extensive discussion with and questioning of the representatives of Morgan Stanley and Heartport's legal counsel regarding Johnson & Johnson's offer, including the terms and conditions of the offer, the stockholder agreement and the termination fee proposed by Johnson & Johnson. In addition, the Heartport board of directors discussed the importance of minimizing the ability of Johnson & Johnson to terminate the merger agreement as a result of adverse changes to Heartport's business related to the announcement of the merger.
