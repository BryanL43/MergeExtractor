      "The implied exchange ratio reference ranges for VMware and Broadcom were compared to the equivalent 100% stock election exchange ratio in the transactions of 0.25200 shares of Broadcom common stock per share of VMware common stock and the unaffected exchange ratio of 0.1762 shares of Broadcom common stock for each share of VMware common stock (based on the trading prices of VMware common stock and Broadcom common stock on the Undisturbed Date, the last trading day prior to public rumors of a potential sale of VMware to Broadcom).\n",
      "Intrinsic Value of Merger Consideration – DCF Based\n",
      "J.P. Morgan conducted a value creation analysis that compared the implied equity value of VMware common stock derived from J.P. Morgan’s discounted cash flow valuation of VMware on a standalone basis to the value of the cash consideration plus VMware common stockholders’ pro forma ownership of the implied equity value of Broadcom.\n",
      "The pro forma implied equity value of Broadcom was calculated as the sum of: (i) the standalone implied equity value of VMware using the midpoint value determined in J.P. Morgan’s discounted cash flow analysis described in the section titled “—VMware Analysis—Discounted Cash Flow Analysis,” plus (ii) the standalone implied equity value of Broadcom using the midpoint value determined in J.P. Morgan’s discounted cash flow analysis described in the section titled “—Broadcom Analysis—Discounted Cash Flow Analysis,” plus (iii) the present value of VMware management’s estimate of the net synergies, calculated on an after-tax basis and less transaction expenses and using a discount rate of 8.0% and a terminal value growth rate of 2.5%.\n",
      "J.P. Morgan then determined the implied pro forma equity value of Broadcom attributable to VMware common stockholders based on the equity ownership percentage of Broadcom of approximately 12% (on a fully diluted basis) plus the cash consideration to be paid to VMware common stockholders.\n",
      "This analysis indicated an implied equity value per share to holders of VMware common stock, rounded to the nearest $0.25, of $155.00, and yielded value accretion to holders of VMware common stock of $11.3 billion.\n",
      "There can be no assurance, however, that the estimated synergies or estimated costs to achieve such synergies will not be substantially greater or less than VMware management’s estimates.\n",
      "Miscellaneous\n",
      "The foregoing summary of certain material financial analyses does not purport to be a complete description of the analyses or data presented by J.P. Morgan.\n",
      "The preparation of a fairness opinion is a complex process and is not necessarily susceptible to partial analysis or summary description.\n",
      "J.P. Morgan believes that the foregoing summary and its analyses must be considered as a whole and that selecting portions of the foregoing summary and these analyses, without considering all of its analyses as a whole, could create an incomplete view of the processes underlying the analyses and its opinion.\n",
      "As a result, the ranges of valuations resulting from any particular analysis or combination of analyses described above were merely utilized to create points of reference for analytical purposes and should not be taken to be the view of J.P. Morgan with respect to the actual value of VMware or Broadcom.\n",
      "The order of analyses described does not represent the relative importance or weight given to those analyses by J.P. Morgan.\n",
      "In arriving at its opinion, J.P. Morgan did not attribute any particular \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "weight to any analyses or factors considered by it and did not form an opinion as to whether any individual analysis or factor (positive or negative), considered in isolation, supported or failed to support its opinion.\n",
      "Rather, J.P. Morgan considered the totality of the factors and analyses performed in determining its opinion.\n",
      "Analyses based upon forecasts of future results are inherently uncertain, as they are subject to numerous factors or events beyond the control of the parties and their advisors.\n",
      "Accordingly, forecasts and analyses used or made by J.P. Morgan are not necessarily indicative of actual future results, which may be significantly more or less favorable than suggested by those analyses.\n",
      "Moreover, J.P. Morgan’s analyses are not and do not purport to be appraisals or otherwise reflective of the prices at which businesses actually could be acquired or sold.\n",
      "None of the selected companies reviewed as described in the above summary is identical to VMware or Broadcom, and none of the selected transactions reviewed was identical to the transactions.\n",
      "However, the companies selected were chosen because they are publicly traded companies with operations and businesses that, for purposes of J.P. Morgan’s analysis, may be considered similar to those of VMware and Broadcom, as applicable.\n",
      "The transactions selected were similarly chosen because their participants, size and other factors, for purposes of J.P. Morgan’s analysis, may be considered similar to the transactions.\n",
      "The analyses necessarily involve complex considerations and judgments concerning differences in financial and operational characteristics of the companies involved and other factors that could affect the companies compared to VMware and Broadcom and the transactions selected compared to the transactions.\n",
      "As a part of its investment banking business, J.P. Morgan and its affiliates are continually engaged in the valuation of businesses and their securities in connection with mergers and acquisitions, investments for passive and control purposes, negotiated underwritings, secondary distributions of listed and unlisted securities, private placements and valuations for corporate and other purposes.\n",
      "J.P. Morgan was selected to advise VMware with respect to the transactions on the basis of, among other things, such experience and its qualifications and reputation in connection with such matters and its familiarity with VMware and the industries in which it operates.\n",
      "For services rendered in connection with the transactions, VMware has agreed to pay J.P. Morgan a fee estimated to be approximately $45 million based on the information available as of the date of announcement of the transactions, which is payable to J.P. Morgan upon the closing of the transactions, $5.0 million of which was earned by J.P. Morgan upon delivery of its opinion.\n",
      "In addition, VMware has agreed to reimburse J.P. Morgan for its expenses incurred in connection with its services, including the fees and disbursements of counsel, and will indemnify J.P. Morgan against certain liabilities arising out of J.P. Morgan’s engagement.\n",
      "During the two years preceding the date of J.P. Morgan’s opinion, J.P. Morgan and its affiliates have had commercial or investment banking relationships with VMware, Broadcom, Silver Lake, a significant stockholder of VMware, and portfolio companies of Silver Lake for which J.P. Morgan and such affiliates have received customary compensation.\n",
      "Such services during such period for Broadcom have included acting as joint lead arranger and bookrunner on its revolving credit facility in January 2021 and joint lead bookrunner on an offering of debt securities in January 2021.\n",
      "Such services during such period for VMware have included acting as joint lead arranger and bookrunner on a revolving credit facility in November 2021, joint lead bookrunner on an offering of debt securities in July 2021, and financial advisor to VMware on the VMware spin-off in November 2021.\n",
      "Such services during such two-year period for Silver Lake and Silver Lake portfolio companies have included extending loans and providing debt syndication, equity underwriting, debt underwriting, private bank lending and capital raising and/or financial advisory services, for which J.P. Morgan and its affiliates have received customary compensation, and, in the case of such services provided to Silver Lake, in amounts not material to J.P. Morgan.\n",
      "In addition, J.P. Morgan’s commercial banking affiliate is an agent bank and a lender under outstanding credit facilities of VMware and Silver Lake portfolio companies, for which it receives customary compensation or other financial benefits.\n",
      "During the two year period preceding delivery of its opinion, the aggregate fees recognized by J.P. Morgan from VMware were approximately $45 million, from Broadcom were approximately $13 million, and from Silver Lake and its portfolio companies were approximately $128 million.\n",
      "In the ordinary course of their businesses, J.P. Morgan and its affiliates may actively trade the debt and equity securities or financial instruments (including derivatives, bank loans or other obligations) of VMware or Broadcom for their own accounts or for the accounts of customers and, accordingly, they may at any time hold long or short positions in such securities or other financial instruments.\n",
      "Interests of VMware’s Directors and Executive Officers in the Transactions\n",
      "When considering the recommendation of the VMware board of directors with respect to the transactions, you should be aware that VMware’s directors and executive officers may have interests in the transactions that \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "are different from, or in addition to, those of VMware stockholders more generally.\n",
      "The VMware board of directors was aware of these interests during its deliberations on the merits of the transactions and considered them in deciding to recommend that VMware stockholders vote to adopt the merger agreement.\n",
      "As described below, the interests of VMware non-employee directors and executive officers include the following:\n",
      "•\n",
      "accelerated vesting of restricted stock units held by non-employee directors and conversion of time-based restricted stock units and performance-based restricted stock units held by executive officers into Broadcom restricted stock units and the “double trigger” accelerated vesting of such converted awards; \n",
      "•\n",
      "a seat on Broadcom’s board of directors for one VMware director, to be mutually agreed by VMware and Broadcom, following the closing of the transactions; \n",
      "•\n",
      "potential severance benefits in the event of certain qualifying terminations of employment upon or following the closing of the transactions; and\n",
      "•\n",
      "the right to indemnification and liability insurance coverage that will survive the closing of the transactions.\n",
      "VMware’s executive officers (all of whom are named executive officers for purposes of the discussion below) are the following: Raghu Raghuram, Zane Rowe, Sumit Dhawan, Jean-Pierre Brulard and Amy Fliegelman Olli.\n",
      "Patrick Gelsinger and Sanjay Poonen are also deemed to be named executive officers, but because they separated from employment with VMware on February 12, 2021 and August 6, 2021, respectively, they will not receive any benefit that is payable or that may become payable that is based on, or otherwise relates to, the transactions other than the merger consideration in respect of any shares of VMware common stock that they own, and they are not included in the disclosure below.\n",
      "Certain Assumptions\n",
      "Except as otherwise specifically noted, for purposes of quantifying the potential payments and benefits described in this section, the following assumptions were used:\n",
      "•\n",
      "A per share price of VMware common stock of $130.09, which is the average closing price of VMware common stock on the New York Stock Exchange over the first five business days following the first public announcement of the transactions on May 26, 2022; \n",
      "•\n",
      "The effective time of the second merger is July 13, 2022; and\n",
      "•\n",
      "The employment of each VMware executive officer was terminated by VMware without cause or by the executive officer for good reason, in either case, immediately following the effective time of the second merger.\n",
      "Treatment of VMware Equity Awards\n",
      "VMware’s non-employee directors and executive officers hold certain time-based VMware restricted stock unit awards and performance-based VMware restricted stock unit awards.\n",
      "No executive officers or non-employee directors hold any outstanding stock options.\n",
      "Upon the terms and subject to the conditions of the merger agreement, at the effective time of the second merger, outstanding VMware restricted stock unit awards and performance-based VMware restricted stock unit awards will be treated as follows, subject to all required withholding taxes: \n",
      "•\n",
      "each outstanding VMware restricted stock unit award held by a non-employee director will become vested and will be cancelled in exchange for the right of the holder to receive, in respect of each share of VMware common stock subject to such award, a payment equal to 50% of the cash consideration and 50% of the stock consideration;\n",
      "•\n",
      "each outstanding time-based VMware restricted stock unit award that is not held by a non-employee director will be converted into a Broadcom restricted stock unit award based on an equity award exchange ratio calculated as (i) the sum of (1) 50% of the stock consideration and (2) 50% of the cash consideration divided by (ii) the Broadcom trading price; and\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "•\n",
      "each outstanding performance-based VMware restricted stock unit award will be converted into a Broadcom restricted stock unit award using the same formula described in the above bullet, \n",
      "provided\n",
      " that (i) for each such award granted under the VMware operating performance stock unit plan, performance goals will be deemed achieved (1) at the actual level with respect to performance periods completed prior to the closing of the transactions, or (2) at target level with respect to performance periods not completed prior to the closing of the transactions; and (ii) for each such award that was granted under the VMware TSR performance stock unit plan, performance will be measured at the closing of the transactions based on the actual level of achievement of the applicable performance goals based on the value of merger consideration (with the value of the stock consideration calculated for such purpose based on the Broadcom trading price).\n",
      "Pursuant to the VMware, Inc. Change in Control Retention Plan (referred to as the CIC Plan) as described below, if a VMware executive officer’s employment is terminated by VMware without “cause” or due to the executive officer’s resignation for “good reason”, in each case, within 12 months following a change in control of VMware, all such equity awards then held by such executive officer would fully vest upon such termination of employment.\n",
      "These “double trigger” vesting provisions applicable to VMware equity awards held by executive officers will continue to apply to such awards after such awards are converted to Broadcom restricted stock unit awards at the effective time of the second merger.\n",
      "See the section titled “Quantification of Potential Payments and Benefits to VMware’s Named Executive Officers in Connection with the Transactions” below for the estimated value of each VMware named executive officer’s unvested VMware equity awards.\n",
      "Based on the assumptions described above under “—Certain Assumptions,” the estimated aggregate value of the unvested VMware equity awards held by non-employee directors is $2,071,683.\n",

      "Each VMware executive officer is eligible to receive change in control benefits pursuant to the CIC Plan upon an involuntary termination without cause or a resignation for good reason, in each case, within 12 months following a change in control of VMware (each such term as defined in the CIC Plan).\n",
      "The transactions constitute a change in control for purposes of the CIC Plan.\n",
      "Upon a qualifying termination under the CIC Plan, subject to execution of a release of claims in favor of VMware, each executive officer is eligible to receive:\n",
      "•\n",
      "a lump sum payment equal to 1.5 times (or 2.0 times for Mr. Raghuram) the sum of the executive officer’s highest annual base salary and highest target annual bonus, in each case measured during the protected period (as defined in the CIC Plan);\n",
      "•\n",
      "a lump sum payment equal to the value of 18 months (or 24 months for Mr. Raghuram) of health insurance premiums, which are equal to 150% of the monthly cost required to obtain continuation coverage for the executive officer and their covered dependents; and\n",
      "•\n",
      "full accelerated vesting of outstanding equity awards.\n",
      "The CIC Plan does not provide for any tax gross-ups.\n",
      "In the event the executive officer would be subject to an excise tax under Section 4999 of the Code, the benefits to the executive officer will be reduced to the extent that such benefits do not trigger the excise tax unless the executive officer would retain greater value (on an after-tax basis) by receiving all benefits and paying applicable excise, income and payroll taxes.\n",
      "See the section titled “—Quantification of Potential Payments and Benefits to VMware’s Named Executive Officers in Connection with the Transactions” below for an estimate of the value of the payments and benefits that each of VMware’s named executive officers would receive under the CIC Plan upon a qualifying termination of employment immediately following the effective time of the second merger.\n",
      "Board Seat on the Broadcom Board of Directors\n",
      "Pursuant to the merger agreement, one member of the VMware board of directors, to be mutually agreed by VMware and Broadcom, will be added to Broadcom’s board of directors.\n",

      "As of the date of this proxy statement/prospectus, no new individualized compensation arrangements between VMware’s executive officers and Broadcom or Broadcom Merger Subs have been established.\n",
      "Indemnification and Insurance \n",
      "Under the merger agreement, for a period of six years after the effective time of the second merger, the entity into which VMware converted in connection with its conversion into a limited liability company (referred to as the VMware Converted LLC) must, and Broadcom must cause VMware Converted LLC to, indemnify and hold harmless, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law and the organizational documents of VMware or its subsidiaries, or any indemnification agreements in existence as of the date of the merger agreement that were provided to Broadcom prior to the date of the merger agreement, each current and former director and officer of VMware and its subsidiaries against any costs and expenses in connection with any actual or threatened claims in respect of acts or omissions occurring or alleged to have occurred at or prior to the effective time of the second merger, whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the effective time of the second merger, in connection with such person serving as an officer, director, employee or agent of another corporation or of a limited liability company, partnership, joint venture, trust, enterprise or nonprofit entity if such service was at the request of VMware.\n",
      "In addition, for a period of six years following the effective time of the second merger, Broadcom is required to maintain in effect the provisions in the organizational documents of VMware and any indemnification agreements in existence as of the date of the merger agreement that were provided to Broadcom (except to the extent such agreement provides for an earlier termination) regarding elimination of liability, indemnification of officers, directors and employees and advancement of expenses that are in existence as of the date of the merger agreement.\n",
      "At or prior to the effective time of the second merger, VMware is required to purchase a directors’ and officers’ liability insurance and fiduciary liability insurance “tail” insurance policy for a period of six years after the effective time of the second merger with respect to matters arising at or prior to the effective time of the second merger, and officers’ liability insurance and fiduciary liability insurance prior to the date of the merger agreement.\n",

      "For more details on the treatment of VMware’s existing indebtedness under the merger agreement, see the section titled “The Merger Agreement—Actions with Respect to VMware Debt.”\n",
      "This proxy statement/prospectus does not constitute an offer to sell or the solicitation of an offer to buy any debt securities of Broadcom or VMware.\n",
      "It does not constitute a prospectus or prospectus equivalent document for any such securities.\n",
      "No offering of any debt securities of Broadcom shall be made except by means of a prospectus meeting the requirements of Section 10 of the Securities Act or an exemption therefrom.\n",
      "Financing of the Transactions\n",
      "The transactions are not conditioned upon any financing arrangements or contingencies.\n",
      "Broadcom anticipates that the funds needed to complete the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement will be derived from a combination of cash on hand and third party debt financing.\n",
      "In connection with its entry into the merger agreement, Broadcom entered into a debt commitment letter on May 26, 2022 with certain financial institutions, which was amended, restated and superseded in its entirety by an amended and restated commitment letter entered into by Broadcom on June 22, 2022 (such amended and restated commitment letter, referred to as the debt commitment letter) with certain financial institutions pursuant to which such financial institutions committed to provide, subject to the terms and conditions of the debt commitment letter, a senior unsecured bridge facility in aggregate principal amount of approximately $32 billion.\n",
      "The availability of the bridge facility is conditioned on the consummation of the transactions in accordance with the terms of the merger agreement (subject to certain customary exceptions and qualifications) and certain other customary conditions.\n",
      "Broadcom expects to replace the commitments in respect of the bridge facility prior to the consummation of the transactions with the proceeds of the issuance of one or more series of senior unsecured debt securities and/or other incurrences of indebtedness (or commitments in respect thereof).\n",
      "Accounting Treatment of the Transactions \n",
      "The transactions will be accounted for as a business combination, with Broadcom using the acquisition method of accounting in accordance with Accounting Standard Codification 805, Business Combinations, and, accordingly, will generally result in the recognition of VMware assets acquired and liabilities assumed at fair value.\n",
      "However, as of the date of this proxy statement/prospectus, the valuation studies necessary to estimate the fair values of the assets acquired (including intangible assets, such as completed technology, customer relationships and customer lists, and trademarks and trade names) and liabilities assumed have been performed based on publicly available benchmarking information as well as a variety of other assumptions, including market participant assumptions, as there are limitations to the type of information that can be exchanged between Broadcom and VMware at this time.\n",
      "Until the transactions are complete, Broadcom will not have complete access to all the relevant information.\n",
      "Differences between these preliminary estimates and the final acquisition accounting will occur and there can be no assurances that the final valuations will not result in material changes to this preliminary purchase price allocation.\n",
      "The excess of the consideration transferred over the identifiable net assets acquired reflected in the unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information will be allocated to goodwill.\n",
      "A final determination of these fair values will reflect appraisals prepared by independent third-parties and will be based on the actual tangible and intangible assets and liabilities that exist as of the acquisition date.\n",
      "The actual allocation of the consideration transferred may differ from the allocation assumed in the unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information and may result in adjustments to the unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information.\n",

      "If a partnership, including any entity or arrangement treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes, holds shares of VMware common stock, the U.S. federal income tax treatment of a partner in such partnership will generally depend upon the status of the partner and the activities of the partnership.\n",
      "Accordingly, such partners and partnerships should consult their tax advisors regarding the particular tax considerations of the transactions to them.\n",

      "Holders of VMware common stock that are not U.S. holders should consult their own tax advisors regarding the possibility that, in the event the applicable withholding agent is unable to determine whether any cash consideration paid to them in the transactions should be treated as a dividend for applicable U.S. federal income tax purposes, such withholding agent may withhold U.S. federal withholding tax at a rate of 30% (or such lower rate as may be specified by an applicable income tax treaty) on the entire amount of any cash consideration payable to such non-U.S. holder in the transactions, and such non-U.S. holders should consult their own tax advisors as to the possible desirability and timing of selling any shares of VMware common stock or Broadcom common stock that they own.\n",
      "In General\n",
      "The obligation of VMware to complete the transactions is conditioned upon the delivery by Gibson Dunn, counsel to VMware (or other nationally recognized tax counsel or Big 4 accounting firm as may be reasonably acceptable to VMware) of the Tax Opinion.\n",
      "In addition, in connection with the filing of the registration statement of which this document is a part, Gibson Dunn has delivered an opinion to VMware that the transactions will qualify for the Intended Tax Treatment.\n",
      "Each of these tax opinions is or will be based on factual representations contained in officer’s certificates provided by Broadcom and VMware, representations and covenants contained in the merger agreement, and on certain customary factual assumptions, all of which must continue to be true and accurate as of the consummation of the transactions.\n",
      "If any of the representations, covenants or assumptions upon which the tax opinions are or will be based is inconsistent with the actual facts, the U.S. federal income tax considerations of the transactions could be materially different from those discussed below.\n",
      "None of these opinions is binding on the IRS or the courts, and neither Broadcom nor VMware intends to request a ruling from the IRS regarding the U.S. federal income tax considerations of the transactions.\n",
      "Consequently, no assurance can be given that the IRS will not assert, or that a court would not sustain, a position contrary to any of those set forth below.\n",
      "Accordingly, and on the basis of the opinion delivered in connection herewith, the U.S. federal income tax considerations of the transactions to U.S. holders generally are as follows.\n",
      "U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Transactions to U.S. Holders\n",
      "The U.S. federal income tax considerations of the transactions to a U.S. holder generally will depend on whether the U.S. holder exchanges its VMware common stock for cash consideration, stock consideration or a combination of cash consideration and stock consideration.\n",
      "Exchange Solely for Cash\n",
      "The exchange of shares of VMware common stock solely for cash generally will result in the recognition of gain or loss equal to the difference, if any, between the amount of cash received and the U.S. holder’s adjusted tax basis in the shares of VMware common stock surrendered.\n",
      "Such gain or loss will generally be long-term capital gain or loss if the U.S. holder’s holding period with respect to the VMware common stock surrendered is more than one year at the effective time of the second merger.\n",
      "Long-term capital gains of certain non-corporate holders, including individuals, generally are subject to U.S. federal income tax at preferential rates.\n",
      "The deductibility of capital losses is subject to limitations.\n",
      "If a U.S. holder acquired different blocks of shares of VMware common stock at different times or different prices, such U.S. holder must determine its adjusted tax basis and holding period separately with respect to each block of VMware common stock.\n",
      "In certain circumstances, if a U.S. holder actually or constructively owns Broadcom common stock after the transactions, the cash consideration received could be treated as having the effect of a distribution of a dividend under the tests set forth in Section 302 of the Code, in which case such U.S. holder may have dividend income up to the amount of the cash consideration received.\n",
      "Because the possibility of dividend treatment depends primarily upon the particular circumstances of a U.S. holder, including the application of certain constructive ownership rules, U.S. holders that actually or constructively own Broadcom common stock should consult their tax advisors regarding the application of the foregoing rules to their particular circumstances.\n",
      "U.S. holders electing to receive solely cash consideration in the transactions may be subject to proration (as described in the section titled “The Merger Agreement—Effects of the Transactions—Proration and Allocation of Merger Consideration.”), which may result in the receipt of a portion of the merger consideration in stock \n",

      "Exchange for Broadcom Common Stock and Cash\n",
      "A U.S. holder who receives a combination of Broadcom common stock and cash (other than cash in lieu of a fractional share of Broadcom common stock) pursuant to the transactions generally will recognize gain (but not loss) in an amount equal to the lesser of (1) the sum of the amount of the cash (other than cash in lieu of a fractional share of Broadcom common stock) and the fair market value of the Broadcom common stock received, minus that U.S. holder’s adjusted tax basis in its shares of VMware common stock surrendered in exchange therefor and (2) the amount of cash received.\n",
      "If a U.S. holder acquired different blocks of shares of VMware common stock at different times or different prices, any gain or loss may be determined separately for each block of shares and such U.S. holder’s basis and holding period in its shares of Broadcom common stock may be determined with reference to each block of shares of VMware common stock.\n",
      "Any such U.S. holder should consult his, her or its tax advisor regarding the manner in which the cash consideration and stock consideration should be allocated among different blocks of shares of VMware common stock surrendered, including the ability to specifically identify shares of VMware common stock exchanged for the cash consideration, and the determination of the tax bases and holding periods of the Broadcom common stock received.\n",
      "Any recognized gain will generally be long-term capital gain if the U.S. holder’s holding period with respect to the shares of VMware common stock surrendered is more than one year at the effective time of the second merger.\n",
      "Long-term capital gains of certain non-corporate holders, including individuals, generally are subject to U.S. federal income tax at preferential rates.\n",

      "Basis of Presentation\n",
      "The unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information is prepared in accordance with Article 11 of Regulation S-X as amended by the final rule, Release No. 33-10786 “Amendments to Financial Disclosures about Acquired and Disposed Businesses.”\n",
      "The historical information of Broadcom and VMware is presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.\n",
      "The unaudited pro forma condensed combined balance sheet as of May 1, 2022 is prepared using the historical unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheets of Broadcom and VMware as of May 1, 2022 and April 29, 2022, respectively, giving effect to (i) the transactions as if they had been completed on May 1, 2022 and (ii) the assumptions and adjustments described in the accompanying notes to the unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information.\n",
      "The unaudited pro forma condensed combined statements of operations for the six months ended May 1, 2022 and the year ended October 31, 2021 give effect to (i) the transactions as if they had been completed on November 2, 2020, the beginning of Broadcom’s most recently completed fiscal year and (ii) the assumptions and adjustments described in the accompanying notes to the unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information.\n",
      "The unaudited pro forma condensed combined statement of operations for the six months ended May 1, 2022 is prepared using Broadcom’s unaudited condensed consolidated statement of operations for the six months ended May 1, 2022 and VMware’s unaudited condensed combined statement of income for the six months ended April 29, 2022, which is derived by adding the audited consolidated statement of income for the year ended January 28, 2022 and unaudited condensed consolidated statement of income for the three months ended April 29, 2022 and subtracting the unaudited condensed consolidated statement of income for the nine months ended October 29, 2021.\n",
      "As the difference between Broadcom’s and VMware’s fiscal year-end dates is less than one fiscal quarter, the unaudited pro forma condensed combined statement of operations for the year ended October 31, 2021 is prepared using Broadcom’s historical audited consolidated statement of operations for the year ended October 31, 2021 and VMware’s historical audited consolidated statement of income for the year ended January 28, 2022, as permitted under Rule 11-02 of Regulation S-X. However, given the different fiscal year ends, VMware’s historical unaudited condensed consolidated statement of income for the three months ended January 28, 2022 is included in both the fiscal year ended October 31, 2021 and the six months ended May 1, 2022 unaudited pro forma condensed combined statements of operations.\n",
      "VMware reported revenue of $3.5 billion and net income of $586 million for the three months ended January 28, 2022.\n",
      "The unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information is prepared using the acquisition method of accounting in accordance with the business combination accounting guidance as provided in Accounting Standards Codification 805, \n",
      "Business Combinations\n",
      ", with Broadcom treated as the accounting acquirer for the transactions.\n",
      "As a result of the proration mechanism described in the introduction section, the unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information is prepared based on the expectation that 50% of VMware’s common stock are cash election shares and the remaining 50% of VMware’s common stock are stock election shares.\n",
      "The unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information is provided for informational purposes only and is not necessarily indicative of the operating results that would have occurred if the transactions had been completed as of the dates set forth above, nor is it indicative of the future results of Broadcom following the transactions.\n",
      "In determining the preliminary estimate of fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed of VMware, Broadcom used publicly available benchmarking information as well as a variety of other assumptions, including market participant assumptions.\n",
      "The purchase price allocation relating to the transactions is preliminary and subject to change, as additional information becomes available and as additional analyses are performed.\n",
      "There can be no assurances that the final valuations will not result in material changes to this preliminary purchase price allocation.\n",
      "The unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information does not give effect to the potential impact of any anticipated synergies, operating efficiencies or cost savings that may result from the transactions or of any integration costs.\n",
      "The unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information does not purport to project the future operating results or financial position of Broadcom following the transactions.\n",

      "Upon consummation of the transactions, management will perform a comprehensive review of the accounting policies between the two entities.\n",
      "Management is currently not aware of any significant accounting policy differences and has therefore not made any adjustments to the pro forma condensed combined financial information related to any potential differences.\n",
      "Upon completion of management’s review, management may identify differences in accounting policies between the two entities which, when conformed, could have a material impact on the financial statements of Broadcom following the transactions.\n",
      "Certain reclassifications are reflected in the pro forma adjustments to conform VMware’s presentation to Broadcom’s in the unaudited pro forma condensed combined balance sheet and statements of operations.\n",
      "These reclassifications have no effect on previously reported total assets, total liabilities and shareholders’ equity, or net income of Broadcom or VMware.\n",
      "The pro forma financial information may not reflect all reclassifications necessary to conform VMware’s presentation to that of Broadcom due to limitations on the availability of information as of the date of this proxy statement/prospectus.\n",
      "Accounting policy differences and additional reclassification adjustments may be identified as more information becomes available.\n",
