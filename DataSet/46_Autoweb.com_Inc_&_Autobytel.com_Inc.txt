BACKGROUND OF THE MERGER

     In light of the rapid changes in the automotive online commerce and
interactive services industries, it had become regular practice of the board of
directors of both Autobytel and Autoweb to review periodically with senior
management the relative position of each company in these industries, changes in
the competitive landscape and technology as well as strategic alternatives
available to each company in order to remain competitive and enhance stockholder
value.
In connection with this ongoing review of long-term strategic plans, each
company has been considering a wide range of strategic options, including
internal growth strategies, growth through various strategic alliances,
investments, acquisitions or business combinations.
In furtherance of these
objectives, from time to time each company has had contact with various parties
to explore on a preliminary basis several of these alternatives, including some
discussions with one or more parties during the time periods described below.

     
During the course of the prior year, various senior management personnel of
Autobytel have been involved from time to time in discussions with members of
senior management of Autoweb regarding a variety of topics related to their
businesses, including a possible business combination.

     
During a meeting in Menlo Park, California on June 30, 2000, between Mark
Lorimer, President and Chief Executive Officer of Autobytel, and Dean DeBiase,
Chairman of Autoweb, the parties raised the possibility that Autoweb and
Autobytel might explore a possible business combination.

     
On July 28, 2000, Mr. Lorimer and Dennis Benner, Executive Vice President,
Corporate Development of Autobytel, met with Mr. DeBiase and Jeffrey Schwartz,
then the Vice President of Strategic Development of Autoweb, in Irvine,
California and discussed the possibility of a business combination.

     
In September and early October of 2000, Mr. DeBiase spoke by phone several
times with Mr. Lorimer and discussed the general terms of a possible transaction
and outlined business integration issues that would have to be analyzed.
During
these conversations, Mr. Lorimer indicated that Autobytel was interested in
continuing discussions regarding a strategic business combination with Autoweb.

     
On October 8 and October 31, 2000, the Autoweb board of directors held
meetings to discuss potential sources of new capital for Autoweb and potential
strategic partners.
During each meeting the board of directors also discussed a
range of economic and operational issues that would have to be resolved in any
transaction between Autoweb and Autobytel.
The Autoweb board of directors
authorized Messrs. DeBiase and Schwartz and other members of Autoweb's senior
management to pursue further discussions with Autobytel.

     
On November 2, 2000, Autobytel and Autoweb entered into a mutual
non-disclosure agreement.

In light of the prior discussions among members of

directors and the presentations and discussions at the current meeting, the

In light of the

AUTOBYTEL'S REASONS FOR THE MERGER

     
At a meeting held on March 29, 2001, the board of directors of Autobytel
concluded that the merger was in the best interests of Autobytel and its
stockholders and determined to recommend that the Autobytel stockholders approve
the issuance of the shares of Autobytel common stock in the merger.
In its
evaluation of the merger, the Autobytel board identified several potential
benefits of the merger, the most important of which included the board's
expectation that:

     - by combining its operations with Autoweb, Autobytel would be better
       positioned to broaden its customer base, accelerate its revenue growth
       and extend its position as a leading provider of automotive internet
       services;

     - by obtaining AIC's capabilities, the combined company would save data and
       licensing costs that Autobytel presently pays to third parties and would
       be better able to provide data content, technology and information
       services to automotive marketers on a global basis;

     - the merger would enable Autobytel to realize significant operating
       synergies, including reduced corporate overhead and the consolidation of
       sales and marketing organizations;

     - Autoweb's cash reserves would enable Autobytel to partially fund the
       anticipated ongoing operating losses incurred by Autoweb until cost
       reductions could be implemented; and

     - the combined companies would be able to employ the best practices and
       processes of each of Autobytel and Autoweb in future operations.

     
Autobytel's board of directors consulted with senior management, as well as
its legal counsel and financial advisors, in reaching the decision to approve
the merger.
In its evaluation of the merger, the Autobytel board reviewed
several factors, including:

     - information concerning the business, financial condition, operations,
       competitive position and prospects of Autobytel and Autoweb both
       individually and on a combined basis including the compatibility of the
       two companies' operations;

     - analyses and other information with respect to Autobytel and Autoweb
       including consideration of the strategic focus of the combined companies
       and the likelihood of their ability to compete successfully;

     - the possibility, as an alternative to the merger, of seeking to acquire a
       different company or establish other strategic alliances;

     - the cash position of the combined companies, especially during periods of
       volatility in the financial markets;

     - the opinion of Lehman Brothers to the Autobytel board of directors, to
       the effect that, based on and subject to matters set forth in its
       opinion, as of March 29, 2001, the consideration to be paid by Autobytel
       in the proposed transaction was fair, from a financial point of view, to
       Autobytel.
The opinion of Lehman Brothers is described below under
       "Opinion of Autobytel's Financial Advisor";

     - the amount and form of the consideration to be received by Autoweb's
       stockholders in the merger in light of comparable transactions and the
       historical market prices, volatility and trading information for
       Autoweb's common stock and Autobytel's common stock;

     - that Autobytel's stockholders would hold approximately 66% of the
       outstanding common stock of the combined company after the merger;

     - the expectation that the merger would qualify as a tax-free
       reorganization;

     - the financial and other terms and conditions of the merger and the
       acquisition agreement;

     - the belief by Autobytel's senior management that the terms of the
       acquisition agreement are reasonable;

     - the potential impact of the merger on Autobytel's and Autoweb's customers
       and employees; and

     - discussions with Autobytel's management and legal and financial advisors
       as to the results of the due diligence investigation of Autoweb.

     
The Autobytel board of directors also identified and considered a number of
potentially negative factors in its deliberations concerning the merger,
including the following:

     - the risk that the potential benefits of the merger may not be realized or
       may be delayed;

     - the costs associated with the merger, including merger related
       transaction costs, costs for disposing of real estate leases and costs
       for renegotiating or terminating marketing and equipment agreements;

     - the difficulty of integrating Autoweb with Autobytel and the management
       effort and costs required to complete the integration following the
       merger, including:

      - the difficulty of maintaining a consistent brand image given certain
        differences in the companies' respective business models;

      - potential difficulties in providing Autoweb customers with the requisite
        level of service in the post-merger transition; and,

      - given the importance of operating the combined companies on a common
        technology platform, possible difficulties associated with migrating
        Autoweb's operations to the Autobytel technology platform;

     - the possibility that the merger may not be consummated, even though it
       has been approved by Autobytel's and Autoweb's boards of directors;

     - the negative effect that treating the merger, for accounting purposes, as
       a "purchase," will have on the combined company's future earnings per
       share, due to amortization of "goodwill";

     - the risk that the premium offered relative to Autoweb's current stock
       price may not be viewed favorably by the market;

     - the impact of the accelerated vesting for certain Autoweb employees'
       stock options after a change in control of Autoweb and after such
       employees' termination; and

     - the other applicable risks described in this joint proxy
       statement/prospectus under "Risk Factors" beginning on page 8.

     
The Autobytel board of directors concluded however, that, on balance, the
potential benefits to Autobytel and its stockholders in the merger outweighed
the risks associated with the merger.
The discussion of the information and
factors considered by the Autobytel board of directors is not intended to be
exhaustive.
In view of the variety of factors considered in connection with its
evaluation of the merger, the Autobytel board of directors did not find it
practicable to, and did not quantify or otherwise assign relative weight to, the
specific factors considered in reaching its determination.


AUTOWEB'S REASONS FOR THE MERGER

     On March 31, 2001, the board of directors of Autoweb unanimously (a)
determined that the proposed merger was consistent with and in furtherance of
the long-term business strategy of Autoweb and fair to, and in the best
interests of, Autoweb and its stockholders; and (b) approved the acquisition
agreement and the other transactions contemplated by the acquisition agreement,
contingent on the resolution of remaining due diligence matters and finalization
of agreements related to the acquisition.
In reaching its decision to approve
the acquisition agreement and the merger and to recommend adoption of the
acquisition agreement by Autoweb stockholders, the Autoweb board of directors
consulted with its management team and advisors and independently considered the
proposed merger, acquisition agreement and the transactions contemplated by the
acquisition agreement.
The board of directors of Autoweb has unanimously
recommended that the Autoweb shareholders vote FOR the approval and adoption of
the acquisition agreement and the proposed merger.
The Autoweb board of
directors identified several potential benefits of the merger, including the
board of directors' expectation that:

     - Given the complementary nature of the technologies and business
       strategies of Autoweb and Autobytel, Autoweb's strategic objectives would
       be significantly furthered by the proposed merger, and as a result,
       Autoweb would be better positioned to reach these objectives than it
       would as a stand alone company.
Autoweb's strategic objectives include
       expanding its customer base and expanding its content and service
       offerings.
In this regard, the Autoweb board of directors believes that
       the merger will result in creation of the most comprehensive online
       automobile-related destination for customers, content and services.

     - The combined company will have a stronger financial position.

     -
The merger will provide current and potential advertising companies,
       automobile manufacturers, dealers and other Autoweb customers with
       increased access to a larger, more targeted and desirable demographic
       group on the Internet.

     -
The merger will result in a combined company that ranks among the largest
       online automobile related Web site networks worldwide, which will create
       greater brand recognition and may attract more customers.

     
- The combined company will be able to take advantage of significant
       operating synergies, including reduced corporate overhead expenses and
       the consolidation of sales and marketing organizations.

     
- The exchange ratio proposed by Autobytel represented, as of the signing
       of the acquisition agreement, consideration having a value, based upon
       the closing price of $1.49 per share of Autobytel common stock on April
       10, 2001 on Nasdaq National Market (the trading day preceding the date of
       the public announcement of the proposed merger), of $0.53 per share.
This
       value represented a premium of approximately 83% over $0.29, the closing
       price per Autoweb common stock on April 10, 2001 on Nasdaq National
       Market.

     
- Autoweb's stockholders will hold approximately 34% of the outstanding
       common stock of the combined company after the merger which will provide
       Autoweb's stockholders with the opportunity to share in the combined
       companies' long-term growth which the Autoweb board of directors believed
       would not be as achievable as a stand-alone company.

     
- The opinion of Autoweb's financial advisor, Credit Suisse First Boston,
       dated March 31, 2001 as to the fairness, from a financial point of view
       to holders of Autoweb common stock and as of the date

of the opinion, of the exchange ratio provided for in the acquisition agreement,
as more fully described below under the caption "Opinion of Autoweb's Financial
Advisor".

     - The expectation that the merger will qualify as a tax-free
       reorganization.

     
Autoweb's board of directors consulted with senior management, as well as
its legal counsel and financial advisors, in reaching a decision to approve the
merger.
In its evaluation of the merger, the Autoweb board of directors reviewed
several other factors, including:

     - Information concerning the financial condition, business, operations,
       strategic objectives and prospects and competitive position of Autoweb
       and Autobytel before and after giving effect to the merger.

     
- Current market conditions and industry trends affecting Autoweb,
       Autobytel and Internet business-to-business and business-to-consumer
       companies in general.

     
- Current financial market conditions and historical market prices of
       Autoweb and Autobytel's common stock.

     
- Volatility and trading information with respect to Autoweb common stock
       and Autobytel common stock.

     
- Autoweb's capital requirements and its ability to attract additional
       capital or financing, if required.

     - A comparison of comparable merger transactions.

     
- The impact of the merger on the advertisers, sponsors, customers and
       employees of Autoweb and Autobytel.

     
- The terms and conditions of the acquisition agreement and related
       agreements.

     
Autoweb's board of directors also identified and considered, among others,
a number of potentially negative factors in its deliberations concerning the
merger and the acquisition agreement, including the following:

     - The risk that the potential benefits of the merger may not be realized.

     
- The potential challenges of integrating Autobytel's operations with those
       of Autoweb.

     - The effect of public announcement of the merger and the possibility the
       merger may not be consummated on the demand for Autoweb's products and
       services and relationships with customers and strategic partners,
       including the potential adverse consequences of employee retention
       associated with providing the notification of possible terminations
       required under the WARN Act.

     - The financial and other terms and conditions of the merger and the
       acquisition agreement including:

      - the non-solicitation and other protective provisions that may have the
        effect of discouraging other persons potentially interested in acquiring
        Autoweb from pursuing such an opportunity as more fully described under
        "The Acquisition Agreement -- No Solicitation by Autoweb".

      - the likelihood that the stockholders of Autoweb and Autobytel may not
        vote to approve and adopt the acquisition agreement and to approve the
        merger;

      - that, while the merger is likely to be completed, there are risks
        associated with certain conditions to the completion of the merger, and
        it is possible that the merger may not be completed even if approved by
        the stockholders of Autoweb and Autobytel; and

      - the costs to Autoweb due to fees payable in the event the acquisition
        agreement is terminated under certain circumstances.

     - Other applicable risks described in this joint proxy statement/prospectus
       under "Risk Factors" beginning on page 8.

     
This discussion of the information and factors considered by Autoweb's
board is not intended to be exhaustive, but includes the material factors
considered.
In view of the number and wide variety of factors considered in
connection with its evaluation of the merger, and the complexity of these
matters, the Autoweb board of directors did not find it practicable to, nor did
it attempt to, quantify, rank or otherwise assign relative weights to the
specific factors it considered.
In addition, the Autoweb board of directors did
not undertake to make any specific determination as to whether any particular
factor was favorable or unfavorable to its ultimate determination or assign any
particular weight to any factor, but conducted an overall analysis of the
factors described above, including thorough discussions with and questioning of
Autoweb's management and management's analysis of the proposed merger based on
information received from Autoweb's legal, financial and accounting advisors.
In
considering the factors described above, individual members of the board of
directors may have given different weight to different factors.
Autoweb's board
of directors considered all these factors together and concluded that the risks
were outweighed by the potential benefits of the merger.

     
For the reasons discussed above, Autoweb's board of directors has approved
the merger and the transactions contemplated by the acquisition agreement and
has determined that the merger and the transactions contemplated by the
acquisition agreement are advisable and fair to and in the best interests of
Autoweb and its stockholders, and recommends that Autoweb stockholders vote for
approval of the merger and the transactions contemplated by the acquisition
agreement.


OPINION OF AUTOBYTEL'S FINANCIAL ADVISOR

     Autobytel engaged Lehman Brothers to render its opinion with respect to the
fairness, from a financial point of view, to Autobytel of the consideration to
be paid by Autobytel in the proposed merger.
On March 29, 2001, Lehman Brothers
rendered its opinion, that as of such date and, based on and subject to certain
matters stated therein, from a financial point of view, the consideration to be
paid by Autobytel in the proposed merger was fair to Autobytel.
Based upon the
conversion ratio of Autobytel common stock for Autoweb's common stock of 0.3553,
the total consideration consisted of 34% of the stock of the combined company.


THE FULL TEXT OF LEHMAN BROTHERS' WRITTEN OPINION DATED MARCH 29, 2001 IS
ATTACHED AS ANNEX B TO THIS JOINT PROXY STATEMENT/PROSPECTUS (THE "LEHMAN
OPINION") AND IS INCORPORATED HEREIN BY REFERENCE.
STOCKHOLDERS MAY READ THE
LEHMAN OPINION FOR A DISCUSSION OF ASSUMPTIONS MADE, MATTERS CONSIDERED AND
LIMITATIONS ON THE REVIEW UNDERTAKEN BY LEHMAN BROTHERS IN RENDERING ITS
OPINION.
THE FOLLOWING IS A SUMMARY OF THE LEHMAN OPINION AND THE METHODOLOGY
THAT LEHMAN BROTHERS USED TO RENDER ITS FAIRNESS OPINION.

     
The Lehman Opinion was provided for the information and assistance of the
Autobytel board of directors in connection with its consideration of the
proposed merger.
The Lehman Opinion is not intended to be and does not
constitute a recommendation to any stockholder as to how such stockholder should
vote on the proposed merger.
Lehman Brothers was not requested to opine as to,
and the Lehman Opinion does not in any matter address, (1) Autobytel's
underlying business decision to proceed with or effect the proposed merger, or
(2) any part of the proposed merger on a separate basis.
The consideration to be
paid in the proposed merger was determined through arm's length negotiations
between Autobytel and Autoweb, and was approved by the Autobytel board of
directors.
Lehman Brothers neither provided advice to the Autobytel board of
directors during such negotiations nor recommended any specific consideration to
the Autobytel board of directors or that any specific consideration would
constitute the only appropriate consideration for the proposed merger.

     
In arriving at its opinion, Lehman Brothers reviewed and analyzed:

     - the draft acquisition agreement and the specific terms of the proposed
       merger;

     - publicly available information concerning Autobytel that Lehman Brothers
       believed to be relevant to its analysis, including Autobytel's Annual
       Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 1999,
       Autobytel's Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for the quarters ended March
       31,

       June 30, and September 30, 2000 and Autobytel's earnings release for the
       quarter and fiscal year ended December 31, 2000;

     - financial and operating information with respect to the business,
       operations and prospects of Autobytel furnished to Lehman Brothers by
       Autobytel;

     - publicly available information concerning Autoweb that Lehman Brothers
       believed to be relevant to its analysis, including Autoweb's Annual
       Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 1999,
       Autoweb's Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for the quarters ended March 31,
       June 30, and September 30, 2000 and Autoweb's earnings release for the
       quarter and fiscal year ended December 31, 2000;

     - financial and operating information with respect to the business,
       operations and prospects of Autoweb furnished to Lehman Brothers by
       Autoweb and Autobytel;

     - a comparison of the historical financial results and present financial
       condition of Autoweb and Autobytel with those of other companies that
       Lehman Brothers deemed relevant;

     - the potential pro forma financial effects of the combination of the
       businesses of Autobytel and Autoweb, including the cost savings,
       operating synergies and strategic benefits expected by the managements of
       Autobytel and Autoweb to result from the proposed merger;

     - a comparison of the relative financial contributions of Autobytel and
       Autoweb to the combined company following consummation of the proposed
       merger; and

     - a comparison of the financial terms of the proposed transaction with the
       financial terms of certain other recent transactions that Lehman Brothers
       deemed relevant.

     
In addition, Lehman Brothers had discussions with the managements of
Autobytel and Autoweb concerning their respective businesses, operations,
assets, financial conditions and prospects and undertook such other studies,
analyses and investigations as Lehman Brothers deemed appropriate.

     
In arriving at its opinion, Lehman Brothers assumed and relied upon the
accuracy and completeness of the financial and other information used by it
without assuming any responsibility for independent verification of such
information and further relied upon the assurances of managements of Autobytel
and Autoweb that they were not aware of any facts or circumstances that would
make such information inaccurate or misleading.
With respect to the financial
projections of Autoweb furnished to Lehman Brothers by Autoweb and Autobytel,
respectively, upon advice of Autoweb and Autobytel, respectively, Lehman
Brothers assumed that such projections were reasonably prepared on a basis
reflecting the best currently available estimates and judgments of the
respective managements of Autoweb and Autobytel as to the future financial
performance of Autoweb and that Autoweb would perform substantially in
accordance with such projections.
However, given that Autoweb's recent financial
performance had not met the projections of Autoweb's management in the past,
Lehman Brothers also prepared and considered more conservative financial
projections based upon the strong possibility that Autoweb would underperform
management's projections in the future.
Lehman Brothers discussed these adjusted
projections with the management of Autobytel and they agreed with the
appropriateness of the use of such adjusted projections in performing Lehman
Brothers' analysis.
With respect to the financial projections of Autobytel, upon
advice of Autobytel, Lehman Brothers assumed that such projections were
reasonably prepared on a basis reflecting the best currently available estimates
and judgments of the management of Autobytel, as to the future financial
performance of Autobytel and that Autobytel would perform substantially in
accordance with such projections.
However, for purposes of its analysis, Lehman
Brothers considered certain somewhat more conservative assumptions and estimates
which resulted in certain adjustments to the projections of Autobytel.
Lehman
Brothers discussed these adjusted projections with the management of Autobytel
and they agreed with the appropriateness of the use of such adjusted projections
in performing Lehman Brothers' analysis.
With respect to cost savings, operating
synergies and strategic benefits expected by the managements of Autobytel and
Autoweb to result from the proposed transaction, Lehman Brothers assumed that
such cost savings, operating synergies and strategic benefits would be realized
substantially in

accordance with such expectations.
In arriving at its opinion, Lehman Brothers
conducted only a limited physical inspection of the properties and facilities of
Autobytel and Autoweb and did not make or obtain any evaluations or appraisals
of the assets or liabilities of Autobytel or Autoweb.
Lehman Brothers' opinion
necessarily was based upon market, economic and other conditions as they existed
on, and could be evaluated as of, the date of such opinion.

     
In connection with the preparation and delivery of its opinion to
Autobytel's board of directors, Lehman Brothers performed a variety of financial
and comparative analyses, as described below.
In arriving at its opinion, Lehman
Brothers did not ascribe a specific range of value to Autobytel or Autoweb, but
rather made its determination as to the fairness, from a financial point of
view, to Autobytel of the consideration to be paid by Autobytel in the proposed
merger on the basis of financial and comparative analyses.
The preparation of a
fairness opinion involves various determinations as to the most appropriate and
relevant methods of financial and comparative analysis and the application of
those methods to the particular circumstances and, therefore, such an opinion is
not readily susceptible to summary description.
Lehman Brothers believes that
its analyses must be considered as a whole and that considering any portion of
such analyses and factors, without considering all analyses and factors, could
create a misleading or incomplete view of the process underlying its opinion.
In
its analyses, Lehman Brothers made numerous assumptions with respect to industry
performance, general business and economic conditions and other matters, many of
which are beyond the control of Autobytel and Autoweb.
Any estimates contained
in these analyses are not necessarily indicative of actual values or predictive
of future results or values, which may be significantly more or less favorable
than as set forth therein.
None of Autobytel, Autoweb, Lehman Brothers or any
other person assumes responsibility if future results are materially different
from those discussed.
In addition, analyses relating to the value of businesses
do not purport to be appraisals or to reflect the prices at which businesses
actually may be sold.

     
The following is a summary of the material financial analyses used by
Lehman Brothers in connection with providing its opinion to the Autobytel board
of directors.
Certain of the summaries of financial analyses include information
presented in tabular format.
In order to fully understand the financial analyses
used by Lehman Brothers, the tables must be read together with the text of each
summary.
The tables alone do not constitute a complete description of the
financial analyses.
Accordingly, the analyses listed in the tables and described
below must be considered as a whole.
Considering any portion of such analyses
and of the factors considered, without considering all analyses and factors,
could create a misleading or incomplete view of the process underlying the
Lehman Opinion.

     
In evaluating the fairness, from a financial point of view, of the
consideration to be paid by Autobytel in the proposed transaction, Lehman
Brothers evaluated Autoweb's contribution to the business, operating assets and
balance sheet of Autobytel using widely accepted methodologies, including
revenue contribution, comparable companies and comparable transaction analyses.

Lehman Brothers believed that these methodologies were particularly relevant,
given the fact that the consideration to be paid by Autobytel in the proposed
transaction represents the right of Autoweb's stockholders to receive 34% of
Autobytel's outstanding shares of common stock, as determined on the day of the
signing of the acquisition agreement and after giving effect to the shares
issued to Autoweb's stockholders.
Based on all of these methodologies, the
exchange ratio range implied a pro forma ownership of Autobytel by Autoweb
stockholders of 34% to 46%.
In performing these analyses, Lehman Brothers relied
on two cases of financial projections: a base case and a conservative case.
The
base case (the "Base Case") was based on projections provided to Lehman Brothers
by Autobytel and Autoweb.
The conservative case (the "Conservative Case") was
based on the adjusted projections prepared by Lehman Brothers after making
certain adjustments to managements' projections to reflect certain somewhat more
conservative assumptions and estimates.

     
Contribution Analysis.
Lehman Brothers analyzed the respective
contributions of Autobytel and Autoweb to the estimated calendar years 2001 and
2002 revenues of the combined company in the Base Case and Conservative Case as
described above.
This analysis indicated the following relative contributions

of Autobytel and Autoweb and the pro forma equity ownership of holders of
Autobytel and Autoweb common stock in the combined company:

                                               2001E CONTRIBUTION                2002E CONTRIBUTION
                                         ------------------------------    ------------------------------
              KEY METRIC                 BASE CASE    CONSERVATIVE CASE    BASE CASE    CONSERVATIVE CASE
              ----------                 ---------    -----------------    ---------    -----------------

REVENUES
  Autobytel............................    58.7%            66.2%            57.1%            67.4%
  Autoweb..............................    41.3%            33.8%            42.9%            32.6%
PRO FORMA EQUITY OWNERSHIP
  Autobytel............................                             66%
  Autoweb..............................                             34%

     From the average revenue contribution for 2001 and 2002 in the Base and
Conservative Case projections, an implied equity value range of the combined
company was assumed according to Autobytel's market value as of March 26, 2001.

From this range, a corresponding range of Autoweb equity values was implied
using Autoweb's average revenue contribution range.
Subsequently, Lehman
Brothers adjusted for the differences in the two companies' balance sheets,
operating items, marketing contracts and employee contracts and severance
agreements, as well as expected synergies for the combined company, to determine
a pro forma equity ownership range of 57.0% to 64.5% for Autobytel and 43.0% to
35.5% for Autoweb in the Base and Conservative Case, respectively.
Lehman
Brothers noted that Autoweb's pro forma ownership of 34% was below both of the
implied ownership ranges.

     Comparable Companies Analysis.
In order to assess how the public market
values shares of similar publicly traded companies, Lehman Brothers reviewed and
compared specific financial and operating data relating to Autoweb with selected
companies that Lehman Brothers deemed comparable to Autoweb, including
Amazon.com, Ashford.com, Barnesandnoble.com, Beyond.com, Buy.com, Drugstore.com,
Egghead.com, Etoys, Expedia, Peapod and Planetrx.com.
Using publicly available
information, Lehman Brothers calculated and analyzed each company's enterprise
value to its historical and projected revenues.
The enterprise value of each
company was obtained by adding short and long term debt, the market value of its
diluted common equity and the book value of any minority interest, and
subtracting cash and cash equivalents.
As of March 26, 2001, the comparable
companies median enterprise multiple of actual calendar year 2000 and projected
2001 revenues were 0.16x and 0.10x, respectively.

     
Using a range based upon the projected 2001 revenue multiple for similar
publicly traded companies between 0.00x and 0.15x, Lehman Brothers calculated
the implied range of Autoweb's equity ownership to be between 41% to 48% in the
Base Case and 41% to 46% in the Conservative Case.
Lehman Brothers noted that
Autoweb's pro forma ownership of 34% was below both of the implied ownership
ranges.

     
However, because of the inherent differences between the business,
operations and prospects of Autoweb and the business, operations and prospects
of the companies included in the comparable companies, Lehman Brothers believed
that it was inappropriate to, and therefore did not, rely solely on the
quantitative results of the comparable company analysis and accordingly also
made qualitative judgments concerning differences between the financial and
operating characteristics and prospects of Autoweb and the companies included in
the comparable company analysis that would affect the public trading values of
each.

     
Comparable Transaction Analysis.
Lehman Brothers reviewed publicly
available information with respect to various transactions involving comparable
public Internet business to consumer ("B-to-C") companies.
In particular, Lehman
Brothers reviewed nine such transactions that have occurred since October 23,
1998 and determined the forward revenue multiples in these comparable
transactions.
Due to the large discrepancy between market values at the time of
such transactions and the current market values of B-to-C companies, the forward
revenue valuation multiples of the selected transactions were adjusted by an
index of similar publicly traded companies used in the comparable company
analysis as of March 26, 2001.
The median enterprise multiple of forward year
revenues in the comparable transactions was 0.13x.
Using a range based upon the
forward 2001 revenue multiple for Autoweb of 0.05x to 0.20x,

Lehman Brothers calculated the implied range of Autoweb's equity ownership in
the combined company to be 43% to 47% in the conservative case and 43% to 50% in
the base case.
Lehman Brothers noted that the comparable transaction analysis
supported its opinion, since the pro forma equity ownership of the Autoweb
shareholders in Autobytel will be 34% after consummation of the proposed
transaction.

     
Lehman Brothers is an internationally recognized investment banking firm
and, as part of its investment banking activities, is regularly engaged in the
valuation of businesses and their securities in connection with mergers and
acquisitions, negotiated underwritings, competitive bids, secondary
distributions of listed and unlisted securities, private placements and
valuations for corporate and other purposes.
Autobytel's board of directors
selected Lehman Brothers because of its expertise, reputation and familiarity
with Autobytel and because its investment banking professionals have experience
in transactions comparable to the merger.

     
As compensation for its services in connection with the merger, Autobytel
has paid Lehman Brothers a customary fee.
In addition, Autobytel has agreed to
indemnify Lehman Brothers for certain liabilities that may arise out of its
engagement by Autobytel and the rendering of the Lehman Opinion.

     
In the ordinary course of its business, Lehman Brothers may actively trade
in equity securities of Autobytel and Autoweb for its own account and for the
accounts of its customers and, accordingly, may at any time hold a long or short
position in such securities.


OPINION OF AUTOWEB'S FINANCIAL ADVISOR

     Autoweb retained Credit Suisse First Boston to act as its exclusive
financial advisor in connection with the merger.
In connection with Credit
Suisse First Boston's engagement, Autoweb requested that Credit Suisse First
Boston evaluate the fairness, from a financial point of view, of the exchange
ratio provided for in the merger to holders of Autoweb common stock.
On March
31, 2001, the Autoweb board of directors met to review the proposed merger.

During this meeting, Credit Suisse First Boston reviewed with the board of
directors of Autoweb certain financial analyses, as described below.
Also at
this meeting on March 31, 2001, Credit Suisse First Boston rendered to the
Autoweb board of directors its oral opinion, subsequently confirmed in writing,
that, as of March 31, 2001, based upon and subject to the various considerations
set forth in the Credit Suisse First Boston opinion, the exchange ratio in the
merger was fair, from a financial point of view, to holders of Autoweb common
stock.

     
The full text of the Credit Suisse First Boston opinion, which sets forth,
among other things, assumptions made, procedures followed, matters considered
and limitations on the scope of the review undertaken by Credit Suisse First
Boston in rendering its opinion is attached as Annex C to this joint proxy
statement/prospectus and is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.

Autoweb stockholders are urged to, and should, read the Credit Suisse First
Boston opinion carefully in its entirety.
The Credit Suisse First Boston opinion
addresses only the fairness, from a financial point of view and as of the date
of the Credit Suisse First Boston opinion, of the exchange ratio to holders of
Autoweb common stock, and does not constitute a recommendation to any
stockholder as to how such stockholder should vote or act on any matter relating
to the proposed merger.
The summary of the Credit Suisse First Boston opinion in
this joint proxy statement/prospectus is qualified in its entirety by reference
to the full text of the Credit Suisse First Boston opinion.

     
In connection with its opinion, Credit Suisse First Boston, among other
things,

     - reviewed a draft of the acquisition agreement dated March 29, 2001;

     - reviewed certain publicly available business and financial information
       relating to Autoweb and Autobytel;

     - reviewed certain other information relating to Autoweb and Autobytel,
       including financial forecasts, provided to it by or discussed with
       Autoweb and Autobytel, and met with the managements of Autoweb and
       Autobytel to discuss the businesses and prospects of Autoweb and
       Autobytel;

     - considered certain financial and stock market data of Autoweb and
       Autobytel and compared that data with similar data for other publicly
       held companies in businesses similar to those of Autoweb and Autobytel;

     - considered, to the extent publicly available, the financial terms of
       certain other business combinations and other transactions which have
       recently been effected or announced; and

     - considered such other information, financial studies, analyses and
       investigations and financial, economic and market criteria which Credit
       Suisse First Boston deemed relevant.

     
Credit Suisse First Boston also relied upon the views of the managements of
Autoweb and Autobytel concerning the business, operational and strategic
benefits and implications of the merger, including financial forecasts provided
to Credit Suisse First Boston by Autoweb relating to synergies and operating
cost savings expected to be achieved through the combination of the operations
of Autoweb and Autobytel.

     
In connection with its review, Credit Suisse First Boston did not assume
any responsibility for independent verification of any of the foregoing
information and relied on such information being complete and accurate in all
material respects.
With respect to the financial forecasts for Autoweb and
Autobytel that it reviewed, Credit Suisse First Boston was advised, and assumed,
that such forecasts were reasonably prepared on bases reflecting the best
currently available estimates and judgments of the managements of Autoweb and
Autobytel as to the future financial performance of Autoweb and Autobytel,
respectively, and the best currently available estimates and judgments of the
management of Autoweb as to the cost savings and other potential synergies
(including the amount, timing and achievability thereof) anticipated to result
from the merger.
In addition, Credit Suisse First Boston relied, without
independent verification, on the assessments of the management of Autoweb with
respect to (i) the future cash and other resource requirements of Autoweb and
Autobytel and (ii) the business and financial implications of Autoweb's failure
to engage in the merger or another similar transaction.
Autoweb also informed
Credit Suisse First Boston, and Credit Suisse First Boston assumed, that the
merger will be treated as a tax-free reorganization for federal income tax
purposes.
Credit Suisse First Boston was not requested to make, and did not
make, an independent evaluation or appraisal of the assets or liabilities
(contingent or otherwise) of Autoweb or Autobytel, nor was Credit Suisse First
Boston furnished with any such evaluations or appraisals.
The Credit Suisse
First Boston opinion is necessarily based upon information available to it as of
the date of the opinion and upon financial, economic, market and other
conditions as they existed and could be evaluated on the date of the opinion.

Credit Suisse First Boston did not express any opinion as to what the value of
the Autobytel common stock actually will be when issued to the holders of
Autoweb common stock pursuant to the merger or the prices at which shares of
Autobytel common stock will trade at any time.
Further, the Credit Suisse First
Boston opinion does not address the relative merits of the merger as compared to
other business combinations that might be available to Autoweb nor does it
address Autoweb's underlying business decision to effect the merger.
Credit
Suisse First Boston relied as to certain legal matters on the advice of counsel
to Autoweb as provided to Autoweb.
In addition, Credit Suisse First Boston
assumed that the merger will be consummated upon the terms set forth in the
draft acquisition agreement reviewed by Credit Suisse First Boston without
material alteration thereof.

     
In preparing its opinion to the Autoweb board of directors, Credit Suisse
First Boston performed a variety of financial and comparative analyses.
The
preparation of a fairness opinion is a complex process and is not necessarily
susceptible to partial analysis or summary description.
Credit Suisse First
Boston believes that its analyses must be considered as a whole and that
selecting portions of its analyses and of the factors considered by it, without
considering all analyses and factors, could create a misleading view of the
processes underlying the Credit Suisse First Boston opinion.
No company or
transaction used in the analysis performed by Credit Suisse First Boston as a
comparison is identical to Autoweb, Autobytel or the proposed merger.
In
addition, Credit Suisse First Boston may have given various analyses more or
less weight than other analyses, and may have deemed various assumptions more or
less probable than other assumptions, so that the range of valuation resulting
from any particular analysis described below should not be taken to be Credit
Suisse First Boston's view of the actual value of Autoweb or Autobytel.
In
performing its analyses, Credit Suisse First Boston made numerous assumptions
with respect to industry

performance, general business and economic conditions and other matters, many of
which are beyond the control of Autoweb or Autobytel.
The analyses performed by
Credit Suisse First Boston are not necessarily indicative of actual values or
actual future results, which may be significantly more or less favorable than
suggested by such analyses.
In addition, analyses relating to the value of
businesses or assets do not purport to be appraisals or to necessarily reflect
the prices at which businesses or assets may actually be sold.
The analyses
performed were prepared solely as part of Credit Suisse First Boston's analysis
of the fairness, from a financial point of view, of the exchange ratio to
holders of Autoweb common stock and were provided to the board of directors of
Autoweb in connection with the delivery of the Credit Suisse First Boston
opinion.

     
The following is a summary of the material financial analyses performed by
Credit Suisse First Boston in connection with the preparation of its opinion,
and reviewed with the Autoweb board of directors at a meeting of the Autoweb
board of directors held on March 31, 2001.
Certain of the summaries of those
financial analyses include information presented in tabular format.
In order to
understand fully the material financial analyses used by Credit Suisse First
Boston, the tables should be read together with the text of each summary.
The
tables alone do not constitute a complete description of the material financial
analyses.

     Such information included, among other things, stock prices as multiples of
estimated earnings per share for calendar years 2001 and 2002, and the multiples
of aggregate value, defined as market capitalization plus total debt less cash
and cash equivalents, to estimated revenue for calendar years 2001 and 2002.
The
multiples were calculated using publicly available information and consensus
forecasts by securities research analysts.
The analysis was based upon the
closing stock prices for all of the companies as of March 29, 2001 and consensus
estimates of securities research analysts.
With respect to Autoweb and
Autobytel, the analysis was based upon the latest available estimates of
securities research analysts,

which estimates for Autoweb were higher than the estimates provided to Credit
Suisse First Boston by Autoweb's management.
The following table summarizes the
results of this analysis:

     Autobytel Cash Burn Analysis.
Credit Suisse First Boston analyzed the cash
resources of Autobytel and its estimated cash requirements for 2001.
Credit
Suisse First Boston noted that Autobytel had $77.5 million in cash at February

Suisse First Boston noted that, based on this cash burn rate, Autobytel had 84.0
months of cash on hand as of February 28, 2001.

Credit Suisse First Boston calculated several values
implied by the exchange ratio of 0.3553x, including the implied price per

prices, the implied fully diluted equity value of Autoweb and the implied pro

forma fully diluted ownership of Autobytel by Autoweb stockholders.

     Precedent Transaction Analysis.
Credit Suisse First Boston reviewed 84
precedent transactions in the software/internet industry and calculated the
implied premiums paid in such transactions over the market price of the acquired
company prior to the announcement of such transactions.
Credit Suisse First
Boston also calculated the price per Autoweb share implied by premiums at the
top of each range considered.
The following table summarizes the results of this
analysis:

No transaction utilized as a comparison in the precedent transaction
analyses is identical to the merger.
In evaluating the merger, Credit Suisse
First Boston made judgments and assumptions with regard to industry performance,
general business, economic, market and financial conditions and other matters,
many of which are beyond the control of Autobytel and Autoweb, such as the
impact of competition on the businesses of Autobytel and Autoweb and the
industry generally, industry growth and the absence of any adverse material
change in the financial condition and prospects of Autobytel and Autoweb or the
Internet industry or in the financial markets in general.
Mathematical analysis,
such as determining the average or the median, is not in itself a meaningful
method of using comparable transaction data.

     
Synergy Analysis.
Credit Suisse First Boston considered the effects of
potential synergies on the estimated pro forma results of operations of the
combined company after the merger.
This analysis was based solely upon the
estimates of the management of Autoweb of the synergies that the combined

company might be able to achieve following completion of the merger.
The
management of Autobytel did not provide estimates of potential synergies to
Autoweb or Credit Suisse First Boston.
The actual synergies achieved by the
combined company after the merger may vary from the potential synergies
estimated by Autoweb's management and the variations may be material.
Based upon
the estimates of Autoweb's management, Credit Suisse First Boston noted that the
combined company could achieve revenue synergies of approximately $2.7 million
in 2001 and approximately $7.2 million in 2002 and cost synergies of
approximately $4.2 million in 2001 and approximately $12.0 million in 2002.

     
Pro Forma Combined Cash Burn Analysis.
Credit Suisse First Boston analyzed
the pro forma cash resources of the combined company and its estimated cash
requirements for 2001.
Credit Suisse First Boston noted that the combined
company would have had approximately $99.9 million in cash at February 28, 2001
and that the combined company would have used $11.9 million in cash during the
fourth quarter of 2000.
Credit Suisse First Boston noted that, based on this
cash burn rate, the combined company had 25.3 months of cash on hand as of
February 28, 2001.
This cash burn rate was based upon historical cash burn rates
and did not reflect any potential synergies that might be achieved by the
combined company after the merger.

     
Contribution Analysis.
Credit Suisse First Boston analyzed the relative
contributions of Autoweb and Autobytel to the pro forma total revenues, total
cash, fully-diluted equity value and fully-diluted aggregate value of the
combined company.
This analysis was based upon the latest available estimates of
securities research analysts for Autoweb and Autobytel, which estimates for
Autoweb were higher than the estimates provided to Credit Suisse First Boston by
Autoweb's management.
The following table summarizes the results of this
analysis:

                                                  AUTOWEB      AUTOBYTEL
                                                 PERCENTAGE    PERCENTAGE
                                                 ----------    ----------

Total Cash.....................................     22.4%         77.6%
Fully-diluted Equity Value.....................     16.3%         83.7%
Fully-diluted Aggregate Value..................       NM            NM

     As a result of both Autoweb and Autobytel having negative aggregate values,
Credit Suisse First Boston noted that the relative contributions of Autoweb and
Autobytel to the combined company's pro forma revenues did not imply
corresponding relative pro forma equity ownership.

     
Pro Forma Cash Impact Analysis.
Credit Suisse First Boston analyzed certain
pro forma effects expected to result from the merger, including the expected
impact of the merger on estimated cash per share of the combined company.
This
analysis indicated that Autoweb's cash per share as of February 28, 2001, when
adjusted for the settlement of existing contracts, would increase by 151.8% in
this situation.

     
Pro Forma Equity Value Analysis.
Credit Suisse First Boston calculated the
price per Autoweb share and premium to the Autoweb share price implied by the
pro forma equity value of the combined company calculated as the sum of the
equity values of each of Autoweb and Autobytel as of March 29, 2001.
The
following table summarizes the results of this analysis:

     Pro Forma Trading Analysis.
Credit Suisse First Boston calculated the price
per Autoweb share implied by the exchange ratio in the merger of 0.3553x,
assuming that Autobytel common stock traded at

various 2002 price/earnings multiples and price/earnings growth rate multiples.

The following table summarizes the results of this analysis:

     Credit Suisse First Boston also calculated the future price per Autoweb
share implied by the exchange ratio in the merger of 0.3553x, assuming that
Autobytel common stock traded at various one-year forward price/earnings
multiples and price/earnings growth rate multiples.
The following table
summarizes the results of this analysis:

  synergies)......................................  $ 2.11    $ 4.22    $ 6.33    $ 8.44    $12.66

     Credit Suisse First Boston did not express any opinion as to what the value
of the Autobytel common stock actually will be when issued pursuant to the
merger or the prices at which shares of Autobytel common stock will trade at any
time.

     
The actual results achieved by the combined company after the merger may
vary from such estimated results and the variations may be material.

     
Credit Suisse First Boston's opinion was one of many factors taken into
consideration by the Autoweb board of directors in making its determination to
recommend the acquisition agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby.

Consequently, the analyses described above should not be viewed as determinative
of the opinion of the Autoweb board of directors or the management of Autoweb
with respect to the value of Autoweb or Autobytel or whether the Autoweb board
of directors would have been willing to agree to a different exchange ratio.

     
The Autoweb board of directors retained Credit Suisse First Boston to act
as its exclusive financial advisor in connection with the merger.
Credit Suisse
First Boston was selected by the Autoweb board of directors based on Credit
Suisse First Boston's qualifications, expertise and reputation.
Credit Suisse
First Boston is an internationally recognized investment banking and advisory
firm.
Credit Suisse First Boston, as part of its investment banking business, is
continuously engaged in the valuation of businesses and securities in connection
with mergers and acquisitions, leveraged buyouts, negotiated underwritings,
competitive biddings, secondary distributions of listed and unlisted securities,
private placements and valuations for corporate and other purposes.
In the past,
Credit Suisse First Boston has provided financial and investment banking
services to Autoweb for which it received compensation.
In the ordinary course
of its business, Credit Suisse First Boston and its affiliates may actively
trade the equity securities of both Autoweb and Autobytel for their own accounts
and for the accounts of customers and, accordingly, may at any time hold a long
or short position in such securities.

     
Pursuant to an engagement letter dated August 23, 2000, Autoweb engaged
Credit Suisse First Boston to provide financial advisory services to the Autoweb
board of directors in connection with strategic alternatives, including the
merger, including, among other things, rendering its opinion and making the
presentation referred to above.
Pursuant to the terms of the engagement letter,
Autoweb has agreed to pay Credit Suisse First Boston a customary fee in
connection therewith.
Credit Suisse First Boston will also

receive a fee for rendering its opinion.
In addition, Autoweb has agreed to
reimburse Credit Suisse First Boston for its out-of-pocket expenses, including
attorney's fees, incurred in connection with its engagement and to indemnify
Credit Suisse First Boston and certain related persons against certain
liabilities and expenses arising out of or in conjunction with its rendering of
services under its engagement, including liabilities arising under the federal
securities laws.


INTERESTS OF AUTOWEB DIRECTORS, OFFICERS, EMPLOYEES AND SIGNIFICANT STOCKHOLDERS
IN THE MERGER

     When considering the recommendation of Autoweb's board of directors that
stockholders approve the merger, you should be aware that some Autoweb
directors, employees and officers have interests in the merger that are
different from, or are in addition to, your interests.
The Autoweb board of
directors was aware of these potential conflicts and considered them.
These
include:

     - Severance Payments.
Each of ten senior officers of Autoweb will receive
       severance payments equal to any unpaid base salary through the date of
       termination plus an amount equal to one year base salary plus an amount
       equal to a pro rated bonus based on the elapsed portion of the year up to
       a maximum of 35% of total annual base salary, in the event the officer is
       terminated without cause or terminates with good reason within one year
       following consummation of the merger.
In addition, fifteen other senior
       employees of Autoweb will be eligible to receive severance payments equal
       to three, four or six months of the employee's base salary if they are
       terminated without cause following consummation of the merger.

     - Accelerated Vesting.
Pursuant to the terms of letter agreements granting
       to ten senior officers of Autoweb change of control benefits, 75% of each
       officer's outstanding unvested options to purchase Autoweb common stock
       will vest on the consummation of the merger and the remainder will vest
       if within one year following the merger the officer is terminated without
       cause or terminates for good reason.

     - Employment.
Two new directors, Jeffrey Schwartz and Mark R. Ross, will be
       appointed to the Autobytel board.
In addition, some executive officers of
       Autoweb will become executive officers of Autobytel.
Autobytel has agreed
       to enter into an employment agreement with Jeffrey Schwartz upon the
       consummation of the merger and may enter into additional employment
       contracts with other employees of Autoweb.

     - Indemnification.
The directors and executive officers of Autoweb have
       customary rights to indemnification against certain liabilities.
Further,
       Autobytel has agreed to use commercially reasonable efforts to provide
       for six years a policy of directors' and officers' liability insurance
       with respect to matters occurring on or before the effective time of the
       merger for the benefit of the directors and officers of Autoweb.

     
As a result, these directors, officers, employees and stockholders could be
more likely to vote in favor of recommending the acquisition agreement and the
merger than if they did not hold these interests.

COMPLETION AND EFFECTIVENESS OF THE MERGER

     
The merger will be completed when all of the conditions to completion of
the merger are satisfied or waived, including approval and adoption of the
acquisition agreement and the merger by the stockholders of Autoweb and approval
of the issuance of Autobytel common stock in the merger by stockholders of
Autobytel.
We hope to complete the merger late in the second calendar quarter or
early in the third calendar quarter of 2001.
The merger will become effective
upon the filing of the certificate of merger with the Secretary of State of
Delaware.


STRUCTURE OF THE MERGER AND CONVERSION OF AUTOWEB COMMON STOCK

     Pursuant to the acquisition agreement, Autobytel Acquisition I Corp., a
wholly-owned subsidiary of Autobytel, will merge with and into Autoweb.

Immediately following the merger, Autoweb will be a wholly-owned subsidiary of
Autobytel.

     
Upon completion of the merger, each outstanding share of Autoweb common
stock will be converted into the right to receive 0.3553 shares of Autobytel
common stock.
No fractional shares of Autobytel common stock will be issued
pursuant to the merger.
In lieu thereof, each holder of shares of Autoweb common
stock who would otherwise be entitled to a fraction of a share of Autobytel
common stock shall receive an amount of cash (rounded to the nearest whole cent)
equal to the product of such fraction multiplied by the average closing price of
Autobytel common stock for the fifteen trading days immediately preceding the
last full trading day prior to the closing date of the merger, as reported on
the Nasdaq National Market.
The number of shares of Autobytel common stock
awarded in the merger, after aggregating all fractional shares of Autobytel
common stock, shall be rounded down to the nearest whole share.

     
Upon completion of the merger, Autobytel will assume options to purchase
shares of Autoweb common stock in connection with the merger.
The number of
shares of Autobytel common stock purchasable under each post-merger option will
be equal to the number of shares of Autoweb common stock underlying the option,
multiplied by the merger exchange ratio of 0.3553 shares of Autobytel common
stock for each share of Autoweb common stock.
The exercise price per share of
the Autobytel common stock issuable under each Autoweb option will equal the per
share exercise price of the Autoweb option divided by 0.3553.


EXCHANGE OF AUTOWEB STOCK CERTIFICATES FOR AUTOBYTEL STOCK CERTIFICATES

     When the merger is completed, Autobytel's exchange agent will mail to
Autoweb stockholders a letter of transmittal and instructions for use in
surrendering Autoweb stock certificates in exchange for Autobytel stock
certificates.
When former Autoweb stockholders deliver their Autoweb stock
certificates to the exchange agent along with an executed letter of transmittal
and any other required documents, the Autoweb stock certificates will be
canceled and former Autoweb stockholders will receive Autobytel stock
certificates representing the number of full shares of Autobytel common stock to
which they are entitled under the acquisition agreement.
They will receive
payment in cash, without interest, in lieu of any fractional shares of Autobytel
common stock which would have been otherwise issuable to them in the merger.

     
Autoweb stockholders should not submit their Autoweb stock certificates for
exchange until they receive the transmittal instructions and a form of letter of
transmittal from the exchange agent.


NO DIVIDENDS

     Autoweb stockholders are not entitled to receive any dividends or other
distributions on Autobytel common stock until the merger is completed and they
have surrendered their Autoweb stock certificates in exchange for Autobytel
stock certificates.

     
Subject to the effect of applicable laws, promptly following surrender of
Autoweb stock certificates and the issuance of the corresponding Autobytel
certificates, Autoweb stockholders will be paid the amount of dividends or other
distributions, without interest, with a record date after the completion of the
merger which were previously paid with respect to their whole shares of
Autobytel common stock.

     
Autobytel will only issue Autoweb stockholders an Autobytel stock
certificate or a check in lieu of a fractional share in the name in which the
surrendered Autoweb stock certificate is registered.
If Autoweb stockholders
wish to have their certificates issued in another name they must present the
exchange agent with all documents required to show and effect the unrecorded
transfer of ownership and show that they paid any applicable stock transfer
taxes.


MATERIAL UNITED STATES FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSIDERATIONS

     
The discussion below constitutes the opinions of Paul, Hastings, Janofsky &
Walker LLP and Wilson Sonsini Goodrich & Rosati, P.C., regarding the material
federal income tax considerations generally applicable to United States holders
of Autoweb common stock who, pursuant to the merger, exchange

their Autoweb common stock solely for Autobytel common stock and cash in lieu of
fractional shares of Autobytel common stock.
Consummation of the merger is
conditioned upon Autobytel's and Autoweb's receipt of opinions of their
respective counsel, confirming their opinions as described in this section
entitled "Material United States Federal Income Tax Considerations," to the
effect that the merger will qualify as a reorganization within the meaning of
Section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code.

     
The opinions of Paul, Hastings, Janofsky & Walker LLP and Wilson Sonsini
Goodrich & Rosati, P.C., set forth in this section entitled "Material United
States Federal Income Tax Considerations" are subject to certain limitations,
qualifications and assumptions and are based on certain facts and
representations, including representations contained in certificates executed by
officers of Autobytel and Autoweb.
The opinions have assumed the absence of
changes in relevant facts or in law between the date of this joint proxy
statement/prospectus and the closing date and assume that the merger is effected
as described in the acquisition agreement and in the joint proxy
statement/prospectus.
The opinions are not binding on the Internal Revenue
Service or the courts and there can be no assurance that the Internal Revenue
Service or the courts will not take a contrary view.
No ruling from the Internal
Revenue Service has been or will be sought.
The discussion below is based upon
current provisions of the Internal Revenue Code, currently applicable U.S.
Treasury regulations promulgated thereunder, and judicial and administrative
decisions and rulings.
Future legislative, judicial or administrative changes or
interpretations could alter or modify (including on a retroactive basis) the
discussion below.

     
The discussion below does not purport to deal with all aspects of United
States federal income taxation that may affect particular stockholders in light
of their individual circumstances, and is not intended for stockholders subject
to special treatment under federal income tax law.
Stockholders subject to
special treatment include, but are not limited to, insurance companies,
tax-exempt organizations, financial institutions, broker-dealers, foreign
persons, stockholders who are subject to the alternative minimum tax provisions
of the Internal Revenue Code, stockholders who hold their stock as part of a
hedge, appreciated financial position, straddle or conversion transaction,
stockholders who do not (or who will not at the time of the merger) hold their
stock as capital assets and stockholders who have acquired their stock upon the
exercise of employee options or otherwise as compensation.
In addition, the
discussion below does not consider the effect of any applicable state, local or
foreign tax laws and further does not consider any tax consequences of
transactions effectuated by stockholders subsequent to, or concurrently with,
the merger.
This discussion also does not describe tax consequences that are
generally assumed to be known by investors.

     
In the opinion of Paul, Hastings, Janofsky & Walker LLP, counsel to
Autobytel, and in the opinion of Wilson Sonsini Goodrich & Rosati, P.C., counsel
to Autoweb, the merger will constitute a "reorganization" within the meaning of
Section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code.

     
Assuming the merger constitutes a reorganization, subject to the
limitations and qualifications referred to herein, the following tax
consequences will result:

     - no gain or loss will be recognized by the holders of Autoweb common stock
       upon the receipt of Autobytel common stock solely in exchange for such
       Autoweb common stock in the merger, except as a result of cash received
       in lieu of fractional shares of Autobytel common stock;

     - cash payments received by holders of Autoweb common stock in lieu of a
       fractional share of Autobytel common stock will result in capital gain
       (or capital loss) measured by the difference between the cash payment
       received and the portion of the tax basis in the shares of Autoweb common
       stock surrendered that is allocable to such fractional share.
Such
       capital gain (or capital loss) will be long-term capital gain (or capital
       loss) if the shares of Autoweb common stock allocable to such fractional
       share have been held for more than one year at the effective time of the
       merger;

     - the aggregate tax basis of the Autobytel common stock received by Autoweb
       stockholders in the merger will be the same as the aggregate tax basis of
       the Autoweb common stock surrendered in

       exchange, reduced by any tax basis allocable to a fractional share of
       Autobytel common stock for which cash is received;

     - the holding period with respect to Autobytel common stock received by
       each Autoweb stockholder in the merger will include the holding period
       for the Autoweb common stock surrendered in exchange; and

     - no gain or loss will be recognized by Autobytel, Autoweb or the
       transitory subsidiary that merges into Autoweb solely as a result of the
       merger.


THE ABOVE DISCUSSION IS INTENDED ONLY AS A SUMMARY OF THE MATERIAL UNITED STATES
FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSIDERATIONS RELATING TO THE MERGER AND DOES NOT PURPORT TO
BE A COMPLETE ANALYSIS OR DISCUSSION OF ALL POTENTIAL TAX EFFECTS RELEVANT
THERETO.
AUTOWEB STOCKHOLDERS ARE URGED TO CONSULT THEIR OWN TAX ADVISORS AS TO
THE SPECIFIC TAX CONSEQUENCES TO THEM OF THE MERGER, INCLUDING TAX RETURN
REPORTING REQUIREMENTS AND THE EFFECT OF FEDERAL, STATE, LOCAL, AND FOREIGN TAX
LAWS.

ACCOUNTING TREATMENT FOR THE MERGER

     Autobytel intends to account for the merger as an acquisition under the
purchase method of accounting for business combinations.


REGULATORY FILINGS AND APPROVALS REQUIRED TO COMPLETE THE MERGER

     
Although not expected by Autobytel and Autoweb, the merger may be subject
to review by the Department of Justice and the Federal Trade Commission to
determine whether it is in compliance with applicable antitrust laws.
Should the
merger meet certain threshold requirements under the provisions of the
Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended, the merger may
not be consummated until the specified waiting period requirements of that Act
have been satisfied.
If required, Autobytel and Autoweb intend to file all
required notification reports, together with requests for early termination for
the waiting period, with the Department of Justice and the Federal Trade
Commission under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as
amended.
Certain Autoweb directors who will be directors of Autobytel after the
merger may also be required to file notification reports with the Federal Trade
Commission.
In addition, the completion of this merger is subject to the
effectiveness of the registration statement of which this joint proxy
statement/prospectus is a part, and compliance with applicable corporate laws of
Delaware.


CERTAIN SECURITIES LAWS CONSIDERATIONS

     The Autobytel common stock to be issued in the merger will be registered
under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act").
These
shares will be freely transferable under the Securities Act, except for
Autobytel common stock issued to any person who is deemed to be an affiliate of
Autoweb or Autobytel.
Persons who may be deemed to be affiliates include
individuals or entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common
control with Autoweb or Autobytel and include officers and directors, as well as
principal stockholders.

     
Autoweb's affiliates may not sell their Autobytel common stock acquired in
the merger except pursuant to:

     - an effective registration statement under the Securities Act covering the
       resale of those shares;

     - an exemption under paragraph (d) of Rule 145 under the Securities Act; or

     - any other applicable exemption under the Securities Act.

     
Autobytel's affiliates may not sell their Autobytel common stock acquired
in the merger except pursuant to:

     - Rule 144 under the Securities Act;

     - an effective registration statement under the Securities Act covering the
       resale of those shares; or

     - any other applicable exemption under the Securities Act.

DISSENTERS' RIGHTS

     No dissenters' or appraisal rights are available in connection with the
merger or any of the transactions contemplated by the acquisition agreement.

Delaware law does not provide for dissenters' or appraisal rights because
Autoweb's common stock is listed on the Nasdaq National Market and because the
shares of Autobytel common stock that Autoweb stockholders will receive in the
merger will also be listed on the Nasdaq National Market.


LISTING ON THE NASDAQ MARKET OF AUTOBYTEL COMMON STOCK TO BE ISSUED IN THE
MERGER

     Autobytel has agreed to cause the shares of Autobytel common stock to be
issued in the merger to be approved for listing on the Nasdaq National Market,
subject to official notice of issuance, prior to the effective time of the
merger.


DELISTING AND DEREGISTRATION OF AUTOWEB COMMON STOCK AFTER THE MERGER

     
If the merger is completed, Autoweb's common stock will be delisted from
the Nasdaq National Market and will be deregistered under the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.

                           
THE ACQUISITION AGREEMENT

     This section of the joint proxy statement/prospectus describes the
acquisition agreement.
While Autobytel and Autoweb believe that the description
covers the material terms of the acquisition agreement, this summary may not
contain all of the information that is important to you.
The composite conformed
acquisition agreement is attached to this joint proxy statement/prospectus as
Annex A and Autobytel and Autoweb urge you to read it carefully.


GENERAL

     Following the adoption of the acquisition agreement and approval of the
merger by Autoweb stockholders and the satisfaction or waiver of the other
conditions to the merger, Autobytel Acquisition I Corp., a wholly-owned
subsidiary of Autobytel, will merge into Autoweb.
Autoweb will survive the
merger as a wholly owned subsidiary of Autobytel.
If all conditions to the
merger are satisfied or waived, the merger will become effective at the time of
the filing by the surviving corporation of a duly executed certificate of merger
with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware.


THE EXCHANGE RATIO AND TREATMENT OF AUTOWEB COMMON STOCK

     At the effective time of the merger, each issued and outstanding share of
Autoweb common stock will be converted into the right to receive 0.3553 shares
of Autobytel common stock, except that any shares owned by Autoweb and any
shares owned by Autobytel or Autobytel Acquisition I Corp. will be cancelled
without conversion.
Autobytel will adjust the exchange ratio to reflect any
reclassification, stock split, stock dividend, reorganization or other similar
change with respect to Autobytel common stock or Autoweb common stock occurring
before the effective time of the merger.

     
Based on the exchange ratio of 0.3553 shares of Autobytel common stock for
each outstanding share of Autoweb common stock, and based on the number of
shares of Autoweb common stock outstanding as of March 31, 2001, a total of
10,490,748 shares of Autobytel common stock will be issued in the merger.


TREATMENT OF AUTOWEB STOCK OPTIONS AND WARRANTS

     At the effective time of the merger, Autobytel will assume each outstanding
option issued under Autoweb's 1997 Stock Option Plan, 1999 Equity Incentive
Plan, 1999 Employee Stock Purchase Plan, and 1999 Directors Stock Option Plan,
whether vested or unvested, to purchase shares of Autoweb common stock on
substantially the same terms and conditions as were applicable prior to the
effective time of the merger, except that (i) the options will be exercisable
for shares of Autobytel common stock, and (ii) the number of shares of Autobytel
common stock which may be purchased will be equal to the number of shares of
Autoweb common stock underlying the option multiplied by 0.3553.
Any fractional
share of Autobytel common stock resulting from such adjustment will be rounded
down to the nearest whole number.
The exercise price per share of Autobytel
common stock issuable under each Autoweb option will equal the per share
exercise price of the Autoweb common stock purchasable under the Autoweb option
divided by 0.3553.
The exercise price will be rounded up to the nearest whole
cent.

     
Autobytel will reserve for issuance a sufficient number of its common stock
for delivery upon Autoweb optionholders' exercise of options.
If the shares of
Autobytel common stock underlying the assumed options have not already been
registered at the time the options are exercised, Autobytel will file a
registration statement on Form S-8 with respect to such shares within three
business days after the effective date of the merger.

     
Within thirty days after the effective time, Autobytel will issue to each
person who, immediately prior to the effective time was a holder of an assumed
option, a document evidencing the foregoing assumption of such option by
Autobytel.


EXCHANGE OF CERTIFICATES

     After the effective time of the merger, Autobytel's exchange agent will
mail to each record holder of Autoweb common stock a letter of transmittal and
instructions for surrendering their certificates.
Only those holders who
properly surrender their certificates in accordance with the instructions will
receive certificates representing Autobytel common stock, cash in lieu of any
fractional Autobytel common stock and any dividends or distributions to which
they are entitled.
The surrendered certificates representing shares of Autoweb
common stock will be cancelled.
After the effective time of the merger, each
certificate representing shares of Autoweb common stock that has not been
surrendered will only represent the right to receive common stock of Autobytel,
cash in lieu of any fractional Autobytel common stock and dividends or
distributions.
Following the effective time of the merger, Autoweb will not
register any transfers of Autoweb common stock on its stock transfer books.

     
Autobytel will not issue any fractional common stock in the merger.

Instead, each holder of shares of Autoweb common stock exchanged in the merger
who would otherwise be entitled to receive a fraction of a share of common stock
of Autobytel will receive cash, without interest, equal to the fractional share
multiplied by the average closing price of Autobytel common stock for the
fifteen trading days immediately preceding the last full trading day prior to
the closing date of the merger, as reported on the Nasdaq National Market.

     
After the effective date of the merger, no dividends or other distributions
declared or made after the closing of the merger with respect to Autobytel
common stock will be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered Autoweb certificate
and no cash payment in lieu of fractional shares will be paid to any such holder
until the holder surrenders its Autoweb certificate in accordance with the
letter of transmittal.
Upon surrender, Autobytel will pay to the record holder
of the certificate, without interest, the amount of cash payable in lieu of
fractional shares to which the holder is entitled and any dividends or
distributions with respect to the Autobytel common stock to which the holder is
entitled which have a record date after the effective date of the merger.

     
If any Autoweb common stock certificate is lost, stolen or destroyed, an
Autoweb stockholder must provide an appropriate affidavit of that fact.

Autobytel may require an Autoweb stockholder to deliver a bond as indemnity
against any claim that may be made against Autobytel with respect to any lost,
stolen or destroyed certificate.


HOLDERS OF AUTOWEB COMMON STOCK SHOULD NOT SEND IN THEIR CERTIFICATES UNTIL THEY
RECEIVE A LETTER OF TRANSMITTAL FROM THE EXCHANGE AGENT.

Business by Company," relating to Autoweb.


AUTOBYTEL'S CONDUCT OF BUSINESS BEFORE COMPLETION OF THE MERGER

     Autobytel has agreed that, until the earlier of the completion of the
merger or termination of the acquisition agreement or unless Autobytel receives
Autoweb's prior written consent, Autobytel will:

     - pay debts and taxes when due subject to good faith disputes over such
       debt and to file tax returns;

     - pay or perform other obligations when due;

     - use all reasonable efforts consistent with past practices and policies to
       preserve intact its present business organization;

     - use commercially reasonable efforts consistent with past practices and
       policies to keep available the services of its present officers and
       employees; and

     - use commercially reasonable efforts consistent with past practices and
       policies to preserve its relationships with customers, suppliers,
       distributors, licensors, licensees, and others with which it has business
       dealings.

     
Autobytel also agreed that until the earlier of the completion of the
merger or termination of the acquisition agreement or unless Autobytel receives
Autoweb's prior written consent, Autobytel will conduct its business in
compliance with certain specific restrictions relating to the following:

     - the repurchase or acquisition of Autobytel common stock except in
       connection with the termination of an employee;

     - any split, combination or reclassification of capital stock;

     - the issuance of dividends or other distributions;

     - the issuance of securities for less than fair market value;

     - amendment of Autobytel's certificate of incorporation; and

     - any action that would make the representations and warranties in the
       acquisition agreement untrue or incorrect or prevent the performance of
       any covenant in the acquisition agreement.


NO SOLICITATION BY AUTOWEB

     Autoweb further agreed to cease, as of the date of the acquisition
agreement, any and all existing activities, discussions or negotiations with any
parties conducted prior to that date with respect to any "Takeover Proposal" as
defined below.

     
Until the merger is completed or the acquisition agreement is terminated,
Autoweb agreed not to, and agreed to direct its officers, directors, employees,
representatives or other agents not to, take any of the following actions:

     - solicit, initiate or encourage the making, submission or announcement of
       any Takeover Proposal;

     - participate in any discussions or negotiations regarding any Takeover
       Proposal;

     - furnish to any person any information with respect to any Takeover
       Proposal;

     - any action that would make the representations and warranties in the
       acquisition agreement untrue or incorrect or prevent the performance of
       any covenant in the acquisition agreement;

     - knowingly take any other action to facilitate any inquiries or the making
       of any proposal that constitutes or may reasonably be expected to lead to
       any Takeover Proposal;

     - engage in discussions with any person with respect to any Takeover
       Proposal; or

     - subject to certain limited exceptions discussed below, approve, endorse
       or recommend any Takeover Proposal.

     
Autoweb's board may, without breaching the acquisition agreement, respond
to an unsolicited, bona fide written Takeover Proposal by discussing the
proposal with, and furnishing information to the party making the proposal, if
all of the following conditions are met:

     - Autoweb's board reasonably concludes that the proposal constitutes a
       "Superior Proposal" as defined below;

     - Autoweb's board determines in good faith, after considering the advice of
       its outside legal counsel, that its fiduciary obligations require it to
       do so;

     - Autoweb gives notice to Autobytel of the determination of a Superior
       Proposal by its board of directors, and Autoweb receives a customary
       confidentiality agreement from that party; and

     - when furnishing nonpublic information to the party making the proposal,
       Autoweb contemporaneously furnishes the same information to Autobytel.

     
A TAKEOVER PROPOSAL is any offer or proposal relating to any "Takeover
Transaction", as defined below, other than an offer, inquiry or proposal from
Autobytel.

     
A TAKEOVER TRANSACTION is any transaction or series of transactions, other
than the merger, involving any of the following:

     - the acquisition or purchase of 20% or more of the assets of Autoweb; or

     - any merger, consolidation, business combination or similar transaction
       involving Autoweb.

     
A SUPERIOR PROPOSAL is a Takeover Proposal if Autoweb's board of directors
has determined after considering the written opinion of its financial advisor
that such proposal is more favorable from a financial point of view to the
stockholders of Autoweb than the merger.

     
Autoweb has agreed to promptly inform Autobytel of any request for
information that Autoweb reasonably believes would lead to a Takeover
Transaction, or of any Takeover Proposal, or any inquiry with respect to or
which Autoweb reasonably believes would lead to any Takeover Proposal, the
material terms and conditions of such request, Takeover Proposal or inquiry.

Autoweb further agreed to keep Autobytel informed in all material respects of
the status and details of any such request, Takeover Proposal or

inquiry, and to provide Autobytel with advance notice of any agreement to or
endorsement of any Takeover Proposal or its withdrawal of its recommendation of
the merger.

     - by mutual consent of Autobytel and Autoweb;

     - by either Autobytel or Autoweb, if any of the following shall have
       occurred:

      - if the merger is not completed before September 30, 2001 except that
        this right to terminate the acquisition agreement is not available to
        any party whose action or failure to act has been a cause of or resulted
        in the failure of the merger to occur on or before September 30, 2001 if
        such action or failure to act constitutes a breach of the acquisition
        agreement;

        authority preventing the consummation of the merger shall have become
        final and non-appealable; or

        for approval by the stockholders of Autoweb at an Autoweb stockholders
        meeting or at any adjournment of that meeting or by the stockholders of
        Autobytel at an Autobytel stockholders meeting or at any adjournment of
        that meeting, except that this right to terminate the acquisition
        agreement is not available to any party where the failure to obtain
        stockholder approval was caused by that party's action or failure to act
        and such action or failure to act constitutes a breach of the
        acquisition agreement.

     - by Autobytel if any of the following shall have occurred:

      - if for any reason Autoweb fails to call and hold the Autoweb
        stockholders meeting by September 30, 2001 unless the reason is that
        this registration statement has not been declared effective by the
        Securities and Exchange Commission at least thirty-five days before
        September 30, 2001 or unless Autoweb is terminating the acquisition
        agreement as a result of Autobytel's breach;

      - if the board of directors of Autoweb withdraws, modifies or changes its
        recommendation that the stockholders of Autoweb approve the merger in a
        manner adverse to Autobytel and its stockholders, unless such
        withdrawal, modification or change is as a result of a breach by
        Autobytel that would entitle Autoweb to terminate the acquisition
        agreement or as a result of a Material Adverse Effect on Autobytel;

      - upon a breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or obligation on
        the part of Autoweb set forth in the acquisition agreement if that

      - if a "Change of Control," as defined below, of Autobytel shall have
        occurred;

      - upon a breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement on
        the part of Autobytel in the acquisition agreement if that breach is not
        cured within ten business days following receipt of written notice of
        the breach or in any event on or before September 30, 2001 if Autoweb
        has not willfully breached any of its covenants under the acquisition
        agreement, which breach has not been cured;

      - if for any reason Autobytel fails to call and hold the Autobytel

        registration statement has not been declared effective by the Securities
        and Exchange Commission at least thirty-five days before September 30,
        2001 or unless Autobytel is terminating the acquisition agreement as a
        result of Autoweb's breach;

      - if the board of directors of Autobytel withdraws, modifies or changes
        its recommendation of the issuance of Autobytel's common stock pursuant

       stockholders at a duly held meeting or at any adjournment of the
       stockholder meeting; or

     - if the acquisition agreement is terminated by Autobytel due to Autoweb's
       failure to call and hold the Autoweb stockholders meeting by September
       30, 2001 unless the reason is that the registration statement has not
       been declared effective by the Securities and Exchange Commission at
       least thirty-five days prior to September 30, 2001 or unless Autoweb is
       terminating the acquisition agreement as a result of Autobytel's breach.

     
Autoweb also must promptly pay Autobytel in immediately available funds an
amount equal to the sum of (1) $1,000,000 plus (2) Autobytel's costs and

If the acquisition agreement is terminated by Autobytel due to Autoweb's
breach of any of its representations, warranties, covenants or obligations and
such breach has not been cured within ten business days of receipt by Autoweb of
written notice of such breach or in any event on or before September 30, 2001
(and Autobytel shall not have willfully breached any of its covenants under the

       recommendation of the issuance of Autobytel's common stock in a manner
       adverse to Autoweb or its stockholders unless such withdrawal,

       of a Material Adverse Effect on Autoweb; or

     - if a Change of Control occurs.

from time to time in one or more series, and to determine or alter the rights,
preferences, privileges and restrictions granted to or imposed upon any wholly
unissued series of preferred stock and to fix the number of shares of any series
of preferred stock and the designation of any such series of preferred stock.

These rights, designations and preferences include voting rights, dividend
rights, liquidation rights, redemption rights and conversion rights.
No
preferred stock is issued or outstanding.

       
COMPARISON OF STOCKHOLDER RIGHTS AND CORPORATE GOVERNANCE MATTERS

     The rights of Autobytel stockholders are currently governed by the Delaware
General Corporation Law (the "DGCL"), Autobytel's certificate of incorporation
and Autobytel's by-laws.
The rights of Autoweb stockholders are currently
governed by the DGCL, Autoweb's certificate of incorporation and Autoweb's
by-laws.
Upon completion of the merger, the rights of Autoweb stockholders who
become stockholders of Autobytel in the merger will be governed by the DGCL,
Autobytel's certificate of incorporation and Autobytel's by-laws.

     
The following description summarizes the significant differences that may
affect the rights of stockholders of Autobytel and stockholders of Autoweb, but
is not a complete statement of all those differences, or a complete description
of the specific provisions referred to in this summary.
The identification of
specific differences is not intended to indicate that other equally or more
significant differences do not exist.
Stockholders should read carefully the
relevant provisions of the DGCL, Autobytel's certificate of incorporation,
Autobytel's by-laws, Autoweb's certificate of incorporation, and Autoweb's
by-laws.


CAPITALIZATION

     Autobytel.
Autobytel's authorized capital stock is described under
"Description of Autobytel Capital Stock."

     
Autoweb.
The total authorized shares of capital stock of Autoweb consist of
60,000,000 shares of common stock, par value $0.001 per share, and 5,000,000
shares of preferred stock, par value $0.001 per share.
At the close of business
on March 31, 2001, there were approximately 29,526,453 million shares of Autoweb
common stock outstanding and no shares of Autoweb preferred stock outstanding.

     
The Autoweb board of directors is authorized to issue preferred stock from
time to time in any series, and to fix and alter the designations, preferences
and relative, participating, optional or other special rights of wholly unissued
series of preferred shares including voting rights, dividend rights, liquidation
rights, redemption rights and conversion rights.


VOTING RIGHTS

     
The DGCL allows for more or less than one vote per share and permits
cumulative voting if each is provided for in the certificate of incorporation.

     
Autobytel.
Each holder of Autobytel common stock is entitled to one vote
for each share held of record and Autobytel's certificate of incorporation does
not permit cumulative voting for the election of directors.

     Autoweb.
Each holder of Autoweb common stock is entitled to one vote for
each share held of record, and may not cumulate votes for the election of
directors.


NUMBER, ELECTION, VACANCY AND REMOVAL OF DIRECTORS

     
The DGCL provides that the board of directors of a Delaware corporation
will consist of one or more directors as fixed by the corporation's certificate
of incorporation or by-laws.
The DGCL also provides that a director or the
entire board of directors may be removed, with or without cause, by the holders
of a majority of the shares then entitled to vote at an election of directors.

However, in the case of a corporation whose board is classified, the directors
may be removed only for cause unless the certificate of incorporation provides
otherwise.

     
Autobytel.
Autobytel's certificate of incorporation provides that the
number of directors shall be set forth in the by-laws and may be changed from
time to time by an amendment to such by-laws.
Autobytel's by-laws fix the number
of directors at eight.
Autobytel's board of directors is divided into three
classes.
After their initial terms, the directors in each class serve for a term
of three years each.

     
Autobytel's by-laws provide that a decrease in the number of directors may
not shorten the term of an incumbent director.
Under Autobytel's by-laws,
vacancies on the board of directors and newly created directorships resulting
from any increase in the authorized number of directors may be filled by vote of
the majority of the remaining directors, although less than a quorum, or by a
sole remaining director.
Each director so chosen to fill a vacancy shall hold
office until his successor shall have been elected and shall qualify or until he
shall resign or shall have been removed.
Whenever the holders of any class or
classes of stock or series thereof are entitled to elect one or more directors,
vacancies and newly created directorships of such class or classes or series may
be filled by a majority of the directors elected by such class or classes or
series thereof then in office, or by a sole remaining director so elected.

     
Pursuant to the terms of the acquisition agreement, on or prior to the
closing date of the merger, Autobytel will take all actions necessary to elect
as directors two individuals designated by Autoweb.

     
It is anticipated that, as allowed by Autobytel's by-laws, the Autobytel
board of directors will vote to expand its current number to 10 and then will
vote to appoint two individuals (see page   ).

     
Autoweb.
Autoweb's board of directors has six members.
Autoweb's
certificate of incorporation provides that the number of directors may be
changed from time to time by vote of a majority of the entire board of directors
and that a decrease in the number of directors may not shorten the term of an
incumbent director.
Autoweb's board of directors is divided into three classes.

After their initial terms, the directors in each class serve for a term of three
years each.

     
Under Autoweb's certificate of incorporation, vacancies on the Autoweb
board of directors and newly created directorships resulting from any increase
in the authorized number of directors may be filled by the directors, acting by
majority of the directors then in office, although less than a quorum, and any
directors so chosen shall hold office until the next election of the class for
which such directors shall have been chosen and until their successors shall be
elected and qualified.

     
Autoweb's certificate of incorporation provides that any director may be
removed at any time, but only for cause and only by the affirmative vote of the
holders of 75% or more of the outstanding shares of common stock of the
corporation entitled to vote generally in the election of directors cast at a
meeting of the stockholders called for that purpose, except that the foregoing
shall not apply whenever the holder of any one or more series of preferred stock
shall have the right, voting separately as a class, to elect one or more
directors of the corporation.

AMENDMENTS TO THE CERTIFICATE OF INCORPORATION

     Under the DGCL, amendments to a corporation's certificate of incorporation
require the approval of the board of directors and stockholders holding a
majority of the outstanding stock of each class entitled to vote on that
amendment as a class, unless a different proportion is specified in the
certificate of incorporation or by other provisions of the DGCL.

AMENDMENTS TO THE BY-LAWS

     Under the DGCL, by-laws of a corporation may be amended or repealed by
stockholders, and, if provided for in the corporation's certificate of
incorporation, by the directors.

     
Autobytel.
Autobytel's certificate of incorporation authorizes the board of
directors to amend or repeal the by-laws.
Autobytel's by-laws may be amended or
repealed by the directors, by vote of a majority of the number of directors then
in office, acting at any meeting of the board, or by the stockholders, by the
vote of a majority of the outstanding shares of voting stock of the corporation,
at an annual meeting of the stockholders, without previous notice, or at any
special meeting of stockholders, provided that notice of such amendment or
repeal is given in the notice of the special meeting.

     
Autoweb.
Autoweb's by-laws provide that its stockholders holding a majority
of the corporation's outstanding voting stock have the power to adopt, amend, or
repeal its by-laws.
Autoweb's certificate of

incorporation gives Autoweb's board of directors the power to adopt, amend or
repeal Autoweb's by-laws except insofar as the by-laws adopted by the
stockholders provide otherwise.


STOCKHOLDER ACTION

     
The DGCL authorizes stockholder action without a meeting unless otherwise
provided in a corporation's certificate of incorporation.

     
For both Autobytel and Autoweb the certificate of incorporation provides
that the stockholders may not take action by written consent without a meeting,
but must take action at a duly called annual or special meeting of stockholders.


SPECIAL STOCKHOLDER MEETINGS

     Under the DGCL, a special meeting of stockholders may be called by the
board of directors or by any other person authorized to do so in the certificate
of incorporation or the by-laws.
The DGCL requires notice of stockholders'
meetings to be sent to all stockholders of record entitled to vote thereon not
less than ten nor more than sixty days before the date of the meeting.

     
Autobytel.
Autobytel's by-laws provide that special meetings of
stockholders may be called at any time by the board of directors, by a committee
of the board of directors whose powers and authority include the power to call
such meetings, by the Chairman of the Board, or by the President.

     
Autoweb.
Autoweb's by-laws provide special meetings of stockholders may be
called at any time by the Chairman of the Board, the Chief Executive Officer,
the President, or by a majority of the members of the board of directors.

     
The by-laws of each company provide that notice of each meeting of the
stockholders, whether annual or special, shall be given not fewer than ten nor
more than sixty days in advance of the date of that meeting.


LIMITATION OF PERSONAL LIABILITY OF DIRECTORS AND INDEMNIFICATION

     
The DGCL provides that a corporation's certificate of incorporation may
include a provision limiting the personal liability of a director to the
corporation or its stockholders for monetary damages for breach of fiduciary
duty as a director.
The DGCL permits a corporation to indemnify any director,
officer, employee or agent of the corporation for expenses, monetary damages,
fines and settlement amounts to the extent the person acted in good faith and in
a manner he or she believed to be in the best interests of the corporation and,
with respect to any criminal action, had no reasonable cause to believe the
conduct was unlawful.

     
The DGCL does not permit indemnification if the person is held liable to
the corporation except to the extent that an appropriate court concludes, upon
application by the person, that despite the adjudication of liability but in
view of all the circumstances, the person is fairly and reasonably entitled to
indemnification for those expenses that the court deems proper.
No provision can
eliminate or limit the liability of a director for:

     - any breach of the director's duty of loyalty to the corporation or its
       stockholders;

     - acts or omissions not in good faith or which involve intentional
       misconduct or a knowing violation of the law;

     - violation of Section 174 of the DGCL regarding unlawful payment of
       dividends or unlawful stock purchases or redemptions;

     - any transaction from which the director derived an improper personal
       benefit; or

     - any act or omission before the adoption of a provision eliminating or
       limiting the liability of a director for breach of fiduciary duty in the
       certificate of incorporation.

     
Autobytel's and Autoweb's certificate of incorporation and by-laws limit or
eliminate the liability of directors to the fullest extent permitted by the DGCL
and require indemnification to the maximum extent permitted by the DGCL.


DIVIDENDS

     
As Delaware corporations, Autobytel and Autoweb may declare and pay
dividends out of their surplus or, if they have no surplus, out of any net
profits for the fiscal year in which the dividend was declared or for the
preceding fiscal year in which the dividend was declared, provided that the
payment will not reduce capital below the amount of capital represented by all
classes of shares having a preference upon the distribution of assets.


PROVISIONS RELATING TO ACQUISITIONS AND BUSINESS COMBINATIONS

     Section 203 of the DGCL prohibits a Delaware corporation from engaging in
any "business combination" with any person who owns 15% or more of a
corporation's voting stock, such as an interested stockholder, for a period of
three years following the time that person became an interested stockholder,
unless:

     - the corporation's board of directors has approved, before the time on
       which that person became an interested stockholder, either the business
       combination or the transaction that resulted in the person becoming an
       interested stockholder;

     - upon consummation of the transaction that resulted in that person
       becoming an interested stockholder, that person owned at least 85% of the
       corporation's voting stock outstanding at that time, excluding shares
       owned by persons who are both directors and officers and shares owned by
       employee stock plans in which participants do not have the right to
       determine confidentially whether shares will be tendered in a tender or
       exchange offer; or

     - at or after the time on which that person became an interested
       stockholder, the business combination is approved by the board of
       directors and authorized by the affirmative vote, at an annual or special
       meeting and not by written consent, of at least 66 2/3% of the
       outstanding voting stock not owned by the interested stockholder.

     
For purposes of determining whether a person is the "owner" of 15% or more
of a corporation's voting stock for purposes of Section 203 of the DGCL,
ownership is defined broadly to include the right, directly or indirectly, to
acquire the stock or to control the voting or disposition of the stock.

     
A "business combination" is also defined broadly to include:

     - mergers and sales or other dispositions of 10% or more of the assets of a
       corporation with or to an interested stockholder;

     - specific transactions resulting in the issuance or transfer to the
       interested stockholder of any stock of the corporation or its
       subsidiaries;

     - specific transactions that would result in an increase in the
       proportionate share of a corporation's or its subsidiaries' stock owned
       by the interested stockholder; and

     - any receipt by the interested stockholder of the benefit, directly or
       indirectly, except proportionately as a stockholder, of any loans,
       advances, guarantees, pledges or other financial benefits provided by or
       through the corporation or any of its subsidiaries.

     
A Delaware corporation may elect not to be governed by Section 203 by a
provision contained in its original certificate of incorporation, its by-laws,
or an amendment to the original certificate of incorporation, which amendment
must be approved by a majority of the shares entitled to vote and may not be
further amended by the board of directors.
This type of amendment is effective
immediately in the case of a corporation that has not elected in its original
certificate of incorporation or amendment thereto to be governed by Section 203
and has never had voting stock listed on a national securities exchange,

authorized for quotation on the Nasdaq Stock Market or held of record by more
than 2,000 stockholders.
Otherwise this amendment is not effective until 12
months following its adoption.

     
Neither Autobytel nor Autoweb has made an election not to be governed by
Section 203 and both are therefore subject to Section 203 of the DGCL.

MERGERS, ACQUISITIONS AND OTHER TRANSACTIONS

     Under the DGCL, a merger, consolidation or sale of all or substantially all
of a corporation's assets must be approved by the board of directors and by a
majority of the outstanding stock of the corporation entitled to vote on the
matter, except that no vote of stockholders of a constituent corporation
surviving a merger is required unless the corporation provides otherwise in its
certificate of incorporation if:

     - the acquisition agreement does not amend the certificate of incorporation
       of the surviving corporation;

     - each share of stock of the surviving corporation outstanding before the
       merger is an identical outstanding or treasury share after the merger;
       and

     - either no shares of common stock of the surviving corporation are to be
       issued or delivered by way of the merger or, if common stock will be
       issued or delivered, it will not increase the number of shares of common
       stock outstanding immediately before the merger by more than 20%.

     Autobytel.
Autobytel is not required by the DGCL to submit the proposed
merger to its stockholders for approval; however, approval is being sought from
Autobytel's stockholders to satisfy the listing requirements of the Nasdaq
because more than 20% of Autobytel's stock is being issued in the merger.

     
Autoweb.
Autoweb is required by the DGCL to submit the proposed merger to
its stockholders for approval.

DISSENTERS' APPRAISAL RIGHTS

     Under the DGCL, dissenters' rights of appraisal are available to a
stockholder of a corporation only in connection with some mergers or
consolidations involving that corporation.
Appraisal rights are not available
under the DGCL if the corporation's stock is either:

     - listed on a national securities exchange or designated as a national
       market system security on an interdealer quotation system by the National
       Association of Securities Dealers, Inc., as the Autobytel and Autoweb
       common shares are, or

     - held of record by more than 2,000 stockholders;

except that appraisal rights will be available if the merger or consolidation
requires stockholders to exchange their stock for anything other than:

     - shares of the surviving corporation,

     - shares of another corporation that will be listed on a national
       securities exchange, designated as a national market system security on
       an interdealer quotation system by the National Association of Securities
       Dealers, Inc. or held of record by more than 2,000 stockholders, or

     - cash in place of fractional shares.

     
Additionally, no appraisal rights are available if the corporation is the
surviving corporation, and no vote of its stockholders is required for the
merger.

     
Appraisal rights are not available to Autobytel or Autoweb stockholders in
connection with the proposed merger.


PREEMPTIVE RIGHTS

     Under the DGCL, stockholders do not have a statutory preemptive right to
acquire proportional amounts of a corporation's unissued shares upon a decision
by the board of directors to issue them.

     
Neither Autobytel's nor Autoweb's certificate of incorporation provides for
its stockholders to have any preemptive rights with respect to any shares of its
capital stock.

                          
THE AUTOBYTEL ANNUAL MEETING

DATE, TIME AND PLACE OF AUTOBYTEL ANNUAL MEETING

     
The date, time and place of the annual meeting of Autobytel stockholders

                                            , 2001
                                  a.m.
Pacific time

PURPOSE OF THE ANNUAL MEETING

     Autobytel is furnishing this joint proxy statement/prospectus to its
stockholders in connection with the solicitation of proxies by Autobytel's board
of directors.
This joint proxy statement/prospectus is being mailed on or about
               , 2001.
The Autobytel board of directors will use the proxies at
the annual meeting of stockholders of Autobytel to be held on                ,
2001 and at any adjournment or postponement thereof.

     
The annual meeting is being held so that Autobytel stockholders may
consider and vote upon the following proposals:

     (1) To approve the issuance of shares of Autobytel common stock in the
         proposed merger of a wholly owned subsidiary of Autobytel with and into
         Autoweb as contemplated by the acquisition agreement dated as of April
         11, 2001, among Autobytel, Autobytel Acquisition I Corp. and Autoweb.
         
Autobytel will issue 0.3553 shares of common stock in exchange for each
         share of outstanding common stock of Autoweb.

     
(2) To elect three Class III Directors.

     
(3) To ratify and approve Autobytel's independent public accountants for
         fiscal 2001.

     
(4) To approve an amendment to Autobytel's Certificate of Incorporation
         changing the name of Autobytel to Autobytel Inc.

     (5)
To transact any other business that properly comes before the annual
         meeting or any adjournments or postponements thereof.


RECORD DATE AND OUTSTANDING SHARES

     Autobytel's board of directors has fixed the close of business on
               , 2001 as the record date for the annual meeting.
Only holders of
record of Autobytel's common stock at the close of business on the record date
are entitled to notice of and to vote at the meeting.
As of the close of
business on the record date, there were        shares of common stock
outstanding and entitled to vote, held of record by approximately
       stockholders, although Autobytel has been informed that there are in
excess of        beneficial owners of common stock.


QUORUM AND VOTE REQUIRED

     Holders of Autobytel common stock are entitled to one vote for each share
held as of the record date.
Approval of Proposals 1 and 3 requires the
affirmative vote of a majority of the outstanding common stock of Autobytel
present in person or represented by proxy at the meeting.
Approval of the
directors in Proposal 2 requires the vote of a plurality of the outstanding
common stock of Autobytel present in person or represented by proxy at the
meeting.
Approval of Proposal 4 requires the affirmative vote of a majority of
the outstanding common stock of Autobytel.
Attendance at the meeting in person
or by proxy of the shares representing a majority of the outstanding common
stock of Autobytel is required for a quorum.

     
On the record date, directors and executive officers of Autobytel as a
group beneficially owned approximately        million shares of common stock.


ABSTENTIONS

     Any abstention will be counted for purposes of determining a quorum, but
will have the same effect as a vote AGAINST the proposals considered at the
annual meeting.


BROKER NON-VOTES

     In the event that a broker, bank, custodian, nominee or other record holder
of Autobytel's common stock indicates on a proxy that it does not have
discretionary authority to vote certain shares on a particular matter, which is
called a broker non-vote, those shares will not be considered for purposes of
determining the number of shares entitled to vote with respect to a particular
proposal on which the broker has expressly not voted, but will be counted for
purposes of determining the presence or absence of a quorum for the transaction
of business.
Failing to instruct a broker on Proposal 4 has the same effect as
voting against Proposal 4.

DISSENTERS' RIGHTS

     Under Delaware law, Autobytel stockholders are not entitled to dissent from
the merger.


SOLICITATION OF PROXY; EXPENSES OF PROXY SOLICITATION

     
The enclosed proxy is solicited by and on behalf of the board of directors
of Autobytel.
In addition to solicitation by mail, officers, directors and
regular employees of Autobytel, who will receive no additional compensation for
their services, may solicit proxies by mail, telegraph, facsimile transmission
or personal calls.
These persons will receive no additional compensation for
solicitation of proxies, but may be reimbursed for reasonable out-of-pocket
expenses.

     
Autobytel will pay all of the expenses of soliciting proxies to be voted at
the meeting, except that Autoweb will share equally the expenses incurred in
connection with filing and printing this joint proxy statement/prospectus.

Autobytel has requested brokers and nominees who hold stock in their name to
furnish this proxy material to their customers and Autobytel will reimburse such
brokers and nominees for their related out-of-pocket expenses.

     
Autobytel has also engaged [               ] to solicit proxies on its
behalf.
It is expected that [               ]'s fees will be approximately
$[               ] plus the reimbursement of expenses.


VOTING OF PROXIES

     
The proxy accompanying this joint proxy statement/prospectus is solicited
on behalf of the Autobytel board of directors for use at the meeting.
Please
complete, date and sign the accompanying proxy and promptly return it in the
enclosed envelope or otherwise mail it to Autobytel.
All properly signed proxies
that Autobytel receives prior to the vote at the meeting and that are not
revoked will be voted at the meeting according to the instructions indicated on
the proxies or, if no direction is indicated, such proxies will be voted FOR
each of the aforementioned proposals to be considered at the annual meeting.

     
Autobytel's board of directors does not know of any matter that is not
referred to in this joint proxy statement/prospectus to be presented for action
at the meeting.
If any other matters are properly brought before the meeting,
the persons named in the proxies will have discretion to vote on such matters in
accordance with their best judgment.

     - delivering a signed subsequent proxy relating to the same shares and
       bearing a later date prior to the vote at the meeting; or

     - attending the annual meeting and voting in person, although attendance at
       the meeting will not, by itself, revoke a proxy.

     
Please note, however, that if your shares are held of record by a broker,
bank or other nominee and you wish to vote at the meeting, you must bring to the
meeting a letter from the broker, bank or other nominee confirming your
beneficial ownership of the shares.

terms of the merger and the acquisition agreement, are in the best interests of
Autobytel and the Autobytel stockholders.

directors recommends that Autobytel stockholders vote FOR the proposal to
approve the issuance of shares of Autobytel common stock thereto, FOR the
proposal to elect three Class III Directors, FOR the ratification of Autobytel's
independent public accountants for fiscal 2001 and FOR the proposal to amend

AUTOBYTEL PROPOSAL 1

              RATIFICATION AND APPROVAL OF ACQUISITION AGREEMENT,
                         MERGER AND ISSUANCE OF SHARES

     
The merger will be consummated on the terms and subject to the conditions

As a result of the merger, a wholly
owned subsidiary of Autobytel will be merged with and into Autoweb, with Autoweb
as the surviving corporation.
Autobytel will issue 0.3553 shares of common stock
in exchange for each share of outstanding common stock of Autoweb.

     
You are encouraged to read the sections of this joint proxy
statement/prospectus entitled "Merger" on page   and "Acquisition Agreement" on
page   .

     
THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS OF AUTOBYTEL RECOMMENDS THAT THE STOCKHOLDERS VOTE
FOR THE PROPOSAL TO APPROVE THE ISSUANCE OF SHARES.

                              
AUTOBYTEL PROPOSAL 2

            NOMINATION AND ELECTION OF AUTOBYTEL CLASS III DIRECTORS

     
The persons named in the enclosed proxy will vote to elect the three
nominees named below under "Nominees for Class III Director" unless instructed
otherwise in the proxy.
The persons receiving the greatest number of votes, up
to the number of directors to be elected, shall be the persons elected as the
Class III Directors.
Holders of common stock are not allowed to cumulate their
votes in the election of Class III Directors.
Shares represented by proxies
which are marked "withhold authority" will have the same effect as a vote
against the nominees.
The Class III Directors are to hold office until the 2004
annual meeting of stockholders and until their respective successors are duly
qualified and elected.


NOMINEES FOR CLASS III DIRECTOR:

        Jeffrey H. Coats
        Michael J. Fuchs
        Robert S. Grimes

     THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS RECOMMENDS THAT THE STOCKHOLDERS VOTE FOR THE
ELECTION OF THE NOMINEES NAMED ABOVE UNDER "NOMINEES FOR CLASS III DIRECTOR."
It
is intended that shares represented by the proxies will be voted FOR the
election to the board of directors of the persons named below unless authority
to vote for the nominees has been withheld in the proxy.
Although the persons
nominated have consented to serve as directors if elected, and the board of
directors has no reason to believe that the nominees will be unable to serve as
directors, if any nominee withdraws or otherwise becomes unavailable to serve,
the persons named as proxies will vote for any substitute nominee designated by
the board of directors.
The following information regarding Autobytel's
directors and executive officers, including nominees, is relevant to your
consideration of the slate proposed by your board of directors:

PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP has been Autoweb's independent auditor since

AUTOBYTEL BUSINESS

OVERVIEW

     Autobytel is an internationally branded online automotive commerce company
that provides consumers with automotive solutions throughout the lifecycle of
vehicle ownership, capturing revenue at multiple stages.
Autobytel owns leading,
branded Internet sites for new and pre-owned vehicle information and automotive
services that link buyers and sellers in an information-rich environment.

Through Autobytel's Web sites, www.autobytel.com and www.carsmart.com, consumers
can research pricing, specifications and other information regarding new and
pre-owned vehicles and purchase, finance, lease, insure, sell or maintain their
vehicles.
Autobytel believes that its services provide benefits for consumers by
supplying them with information to make informed and intelligent vehicle
decisions throughout the lifecycle of vehicle ownership.

     
Consumers can purchase new vehicles through Autobytel's dealer referral
network.
When consumers indicate they are ready to buy a vehicle, they can be
connected to Autobytel's network of over 4,700 participating dealers in North
America as of March 31, 2001, of which approximately 3,500 are Autobytel.com(R)
dealers and approximately 1,200 are CarSmart.com(SM) dealers, with each dealer
representing a particular vehicle make.
Approximately 400 dealers subscribe to
both the Autobytel and CarSmart services.
Dealers participate in Autobytel's
network by entering into non-exclusive contracts with Autobytel.
Autobytel
expects its dealers to promptly provide a haggle-free, competitive offer.
Fees
paid by participating dealers constitute the majority of Autobytel's revenues.

     
Consumers can purchase pre-owned vehicles through Autobytel's Pre-Owned
CyberStore.
The Pre-Owned CyberStore allows consumers to search for a pre-owned
vehicle according to the price, make, model, color, year and location of the
vehicle.
The CyberStore locates and displays the description, location and, if
available, actual photograph of vehicles that satisfy the consumer's search
parameters.

     
Autobytel's MyGarage service area is designed to empower consumers by
providing cost effective and efficient processes for dealing with common service
and maintenance issues.
The site enhances consumer personalization and includes
key components such as access to Autobytel Accredited Service Centers, the
ability to schedule service and maintenance appointments online and receive
information such as service reminders and recall information.

     
Consumers can also apply for and receive insurance, financing, leasing and
warranty proposals as well as other services and information through Autobytel's
Web sites.
In an arrangement with Peoplefirst Autobytel provides consumers with
access to competitive loan rates.
Autobytel also provides a link on its Web
sites so consumers can receive real-time quotes for insurance coverage from
Channelpoint Corporation and submit quote applications online.
Participants in
the program include The Hartford (Hartford Financial Services Group, Inc.), The
GE Auto Insurance Program and Ekemper.

     
In 1999 and 2000, Autobytel established joint ventures and entered into
licensing agreements in Europe, Japan and Australia and is exploring additional
opportunities in Europe, Asia and Latin America.
Autobytel receives fees from
licensing agreements.

     
In February 2000, Autobytel acquired A.I.N. Corporation, the owner of
CarSmart, one of the leading online buying sites for new and pre-owned vehicles,
for 1.8 million shares of Autobytel common stock and $3 million in cash.
As of
March 31, 2001, CarSmart had approximately 1,200 dealers, established
relationships with more than 200 credit unions and strategic marketing
agreements with several of the top Internet portals, including AOL.com, Alta
Vista and GO2Net.
Autobytel is currently in the process of integrating the
executive and administrative personnel of CarSmart into its operations.

Autobytel continues to operate CarSmart as a separate Web site, and Autobytel
has not yet determined whether it will integrate it into the Autobytel Web site
in the future.

     
In January 2001, Autobytel introduced iManager(SM), a multi-functional
dealer management system and an upgrade of its Dealer Real Time(R) system.

Autobytel is converting the Autobytel dealers from the Dealer Real Time system
to iManager.
The iManager system provides dealers with immediate purchase

request information for new and pre-owned vehicles, the ability to track
multiple customers and purchase requests, turnkey customer retention programs,
automatic uploading of new and pre-owned vehicle inventory into Autobytel's
database, reporting systems, including transaction status, customer information
and Internet department performance, and other features.
The CarSmart dealers
use a dealer system called SmarTrack.

     
In February 2001, Autobytel signed an agreement with General Motors
Corporation (GM) to conduct a 90-day test of a new GM online locate-to-order
business model.
The model involves modification of Autobytel's existing Web site
for consumers from the Washington, D.C. metropolitan area.
The test program,
which commenced on May 1, 2001, combines the independent all makes, all models
capability of Autobytel with a dealer-set online e-price and locate-to-order
vehicle inventory model for Chevrolet vehicles.

     
In May 2001, as part of a periodic review of its business lines, Autobytel
decided to suspend operations of its locate-to-order service, AutobytelDIRECT.

Autobytel believes that the program was unable to attain the scale required to
be profitable.
In the future, Autobytel may reintroduce a locate-to-order
service depending on market conditions.

     
Autobytel is a Delaware corporation incorporated on May 17, 1996.
It was
previously formed in Delaware in January 1995 as a limited liability company
under the name Auto-By-Tel LLC.
Autobytel's principal corporate offices are
located in Irvine, California.
Autobytel completed its initial public offering
in March 1999 and its common stock is listed on the Nasdaq National Market under
the symbol "ABTL.
"

BACKGROUND

     Growth of the Internet and Online Commerce.
The Web and online services
have emerged as significant global communications and commercial media enabling
millions of people worldwide to share information, communicate and conduct
business electronically.
Autobytel believes that the number of Web users will
grow based on a number of factors, including the large and growing base of
installed personal computers in the home and workplace, the decreasing cost of
personal computers, easier, faster and cheaper access to the Internet, the
distribution of broadband applications, the proliferation of Internet content
and the increasing familiarity and acceptance of the Internet by businesses and
consumers.

     
The growth in the use of the Internet has also led to a rapid growth of
online commerce.
Web commerce sites are enabling businesses to target and manage
a broad customer base and establish and maintain ongoing direct customer
relationships.
As a growing number of businesses and information providers have
begun marketing on the Web, it has rapidly become a medium in which consumers
can access a vast amount of information regarding the pricing, quality and
specification of products.
Additionally, online transactions can be faster, less
expensive and more convenient than transactions conducted in person or over the
telephone.

     
The Automotive Vehicle Market.
Automotive dealers operate in localized
markets and face significant state regulations and increasing business
pressures.
These fragmented markets, with approximately 47,000 dealers in
aggregate, are characterized by:

     - a perceived overabundance of dealerships,

     - competitive sales within regional markets,

     - increasing advertising and marketing costs that continue to reduce dealer
       profits,

     - high-pressure sales tactics with consumers, and

     - large investments by dealers in real estate, construction, personnel and
       other overhead expenses.

     
In addition, consumers have traditionally entered into the highly
negotiated sales process with relatively little information regarding
manufacturer's costs, leasing costs, financing costs, relative specifications
and other important information.
Buying a vehicle is considered to be one of the
most significant purchases a United States consumer makes.
According to Manheim
Auctions, approximately

$744 billion and $702 billion was spent on new and pre-owned vehicles in the
United States representing the sale of approximately 59 million and 58 million
vehicles in 2000 and 1999, respectively.
Although automotive retailing attracts
significant consumer dollars, Autobytel believes that consumers associate the
traditional vehicle buying experience with high-pressure sales tactics.


THE AUTOBYTEL.COM SOLUTION

     Autobytel believes that its online products and services improve the
vehicle purchasing process for both consumers and dealers.
Autobytel offers
consumers information-rich Web sites, numerous tools to configure this
information, and a quality fulfillment experience.
As part of the fulfillment
experience, Autobytel expects its dealers to provide competitive price quotes
for new and pre-owned vehicles.
Autobytel believes its services enable dealers
to reduce personnel and marketing costs, increase consumer satisfaction and
increase customer volume.

     
Benefits to Consumers.
Autobytel's Web sites provide consumers free of
charge up-to-date specifications and pricing information on vehicles.
In
addition, Autobytel's consumers gain easy access to valuable automotive
information, such as dealer invoice pricing and tools consisting of a lease
calculator, a loan calculator to determine monthly payments and a lease or buy
decision assistant.
Autobytel's database of articles allows consumers to perform
online library research by accessing documents such as weekly automotive
reports, consumer reviews and manufacturer brochures.
Various automotive
information service providers, such as Edmund's, Kelley Blue Book, Pace
Publication's Carprice.com and IntelliChoice, are also available on Autobytel's
Web site to assist consumers with specific vehicle and related automotive
decisions such as insurance and financing.
Armed with such information, the
consumer should be more confident and capable of making an informed and
intelligent vehicle buying decision.

     
Autobytel believes it offers consumers a significantly different vehicle
purchasing experience from that of traditional methods.
Consumers using
Autobytel's Web sites are able to shop for a vehicle, and make financing and
insurance decisions from the convenience of their own home or office.
Autobytel
expects dealers to provide consumers a haggle-free price quote within 24 hours
and a high level of customer service.
Autobytel forms its dealer relationships
after careful analysis of automotive sales and demographic data in each region.

Autobytel seeks to include in its dealer network the highest quality dealers
within defined territories.

     Benefits to Dealers.
Autobytel believes it benefits dealers by reducing the
dealers' incremental personnel and marketing costs, increasing consumer
satisfaction and increasing sales volume.
Through Autobytel's investment in
national advertising and brand recognition of Autobytel and CarSmart, it
attracts consumers to Autobytel's Web sites and, based on the consumers'
preference, Autobytel directs them to dealers in their local area.
Autobytel
believes this provides dealers access to a larger number of prequalified
consumers.
Autobytel believes dealers' personnel costs should be reduced because
Autobytel provides dealers access to potential purchasers who have completed
their research and should be ready to buy or lease a vehicle.
As a result,
reaching these consumers and selling or leasing them vehicles costs the dealer
little or no additional overhead expense other than the fees paid to Autobytel
and the personnel costs of a dedicated manager.
Through Autobytel's iManager and
Dealer Real Time systems, Autobytel provides dealers with on-site technology to
better track sales, inventory, customer solicitations, responses and other
communications.

     
By providing consumers a quality fulfillment experience, Autobytel seeks to
provide its dealers a large number of consumers, which allows them to compete
more effectively.
Autobytel's solution includes a network of over 4,700
participating dealers in the United States and Canada, as of March 31, 2001,
representing every major domestic and imported make of vehicles and light
trucks.

     
To incent a dealer to participate in the Autobytel or CarSmart network,
Autobytel allocates each dealer an exclusive geographic territory in such
network based upon specific vehicle make.
A territory allocated by Autobytel to
a dealer is generally larger than a territory assigned to a dealer by a
manufacturer.

     
Autobytel's Web Sites.
Because Web sites can be continually updated and
provide a large quantity of quality information, Autobytel believes the Internet
offers the most efficient medium for consumers to learn about and shop for
vehicles.
The Internet's global reach to consumers allows Autobytel to leverage
its investment in branding and marketing across a very large national and
international audience to create qualified purchase requests for vehicles.
For
these reasons, Autobytel also believes that the Internet represents the most
efficient method of directing purchase requests to local markets and dealers.

     
Autobytel currently provides the following services on its Autobytel.com
Web site:

     CarSmart currently provides the following services on its Web site:

STRATEGY

     Autobytel's primary objective is to connect buyers and sellers in an
information-rich environment throughout the vehicle ownership lifecycle.

Autobytel intends to achieve this objective through the following principal
strategies:

     Continue to Build Brand Equity.
Autobytel believes that due to its focus on
both online and traditional marketing, it owns two of the leading brand names in
its sector.
Autobytel intends to continue to market and advertise to enhance its
brand recognition with consumers.
Autobytel believes that continuing to
strengthen brand awareness of the Autobytel and CarSmart names among consumers
is critical to attract vehicle buyers, increase purchase requests and, in turn,
maintain and increase the size of Autobytel's dealer base.
Autobytel intends to
continue advertising on the Internet and through traditional media, such as
television, radio and print publications.

     
Ensure the Highest Quality Consumer Experience.
Autobytel believes that
consumer satisfaction and loyalty is heavily influenced by the consumer's
experience with its sites and with its dealers.
In order to enhance Autobytel's
appeal to consumers, Autobytel intends to continue developing its Web sites by
enhancing vehicle information and personalization.
Autobytel formed I-Net
Training Technologies LLC with third parties to provide dealers with more
extensive training and tools to facilitate Internet selling of vehicles.
In
addition, Autobytel plans to continue compiling high quality content from third
party sources on its sites, including information from Edmund's, IntelliChoice,
Carprices.com and Kelley Blue Book.
Autobytel believes that consumer
satisfaction with the vehicle purchasing experience is also essential to its
success and the differentiation of its services from those of its competitors.

Autobytel intends to continue to invest in its dealer training and support
services to ensure a consistent, high-quality alternative to the traditional
vehicle buying process.

     
Increase Purchase Requests.
Autobytel believes that increasing the volume
and quality of purchase requests directed from its Web sites to its dealer
networks is crucial to the long-term growth and success of Autobytel's business.

By augmenting the volume of quality purchase requests, Autobytel expects to
attract additional dealers to Autobytel's networks, increase fees paid by
dealers, and solidify its relationships with participating dealers.
Autobytel's
strategy for increasing traffic to its sites and the number of purchase requests
includes forming and maintaining online sponsorships and alliances with Internet
portals and with Internet automotive information providers.
As part of
Autobytel's strategy to improve the quality of purchase requests, Autobytel
continues to expand the breadth and depth of information and services available
through Autobytel's Web sites so that well informed, ready-to-buy consumers can
be directed to participating dealers.

     
Expand and Improve Dealer Network.
Autobytel believes that strengthening
the size and quality of its dealer networks is important to the success and
growth of Autobytel's business.
Autobytel's strategy is to increase the size of
its dealer networks by attracting new dealers and strengthening relationships
with existing dealers by:

     - increasing the volume and quality of purchase requests,

     - advertising in trade publications aimed at dealers and participating in
       industry trade shows,

     - maintaining Autobytel's extensive training and support programs to
       participating dealers, and

     - providing Autobytel's iManager, Dealer Real Time or SmarTrack systems, as
       applicable, to all participating dealers.

     
Invest in Related Products and Services.
Autobytel believes that expanding
its products and services to both consumers and dealers is critical to establish
itself as the premier provider of online automotive products and services.

Autobytel's strategy is to continue to enhance personalization features and
invest in related products and services, such as the CyberStore, maintenance and
service, and warranty, finance and insurance services.
The iManager, Dealer Real
Time and SmarTrack systems will allow Autobytel to launch new products and
services for Autobytel's dealers.
Autobytel also allows dealers to offer
accessories directly through its Web sites.
Autobytel expanded the advertising
sales on its Web sites and marketed the

information in its database in accordance with its privacy policy.
Autobytel
expects to further expand these businesses.

     
Expand Internationally.
Autobytel intends to continue its international
expansion through licensing agreements and joint ventures with local strategic
investors.
In January 2000, Autobytel.
Europe LLC and Autobytel entered into an
operating agreement with Inchcape plc, Pon Holdings B.V. and GE Capital Equity
Holdings, Inc. to expand its existing operations and business throughout Europe.

Autobytel licensed its technology, business processes and trade name to
Autobytel.
Europe on a royalty free perpetual basis and contributed to
Autobytel.
Europe its existing license agreements for the United Kingdom and
Scandinavia and Finland.
In turn, Autobytel.
Europe intends to license such
technology, business processes and trade name to other national operating
companies in European countries.
Autobytel.
Europe will usually invest in such
national operating companies or obtain options to acquire equity positions in
such companies.
Autobytel.
Europe currently has licensing agreements for the
United Kingdom, Sweden, Spain and The Netherlands and intends to establish
licensing agreements in Germany, France and Italy as well as certain other
countries in Western and Eastern Europe.
Autobytel has also established joint
ventures in Japan and Australia with several strategic investors.
Autobytel is
currently exploring additional opportunities in Asia and Latin America.

PRODUCTS, PROGRAMS AND SERVICES

     New Vehicle Purchasing Service.
Autobytel's new vehicle purchasing service
enables consumers to shop for and select a new vehicle through its Web sites by
providing research on new vehicles such as pricing, features, specifications and
colors.
When consumers indicate they are ready to buy a vehicle, a consumer can
complete a purchase request online, which specifies the type of vehicle and
accessories the consumer desires, along with the consumer's contact information.

The purchase request is then routed by Autobytel to the nearest participating
dealer that sells the type of vehicle requested, and Autobytel promptly returns
an e-mail message to the consumer with the dealership's name and phone number
and the name of the dedicated manager at the dealership.
Dealers agree in their
contracts to contact the consumer within 24 hours of receiving the purchase
request with a firm, haggle-free price quote for the requested vehicle.
When
consumers complete their purchase, they usually take delivery of their vehicle
at the dealership showroom.
Generally, within 14 days of the submission of a
consumer's purchase request, Autobytel contacts the consumer again by e-mail to
conduct a quality assurance survey that allows Autobytel to evaluate the sales
process at participating dealers and improve the quality of dealer service.

     
Autobytel's network had over 4,700 dealers as of March 31, 2001, which
represents a decline from the number of dealers Autobytel had as of December 31,
2000, of which approximately 3,500 are Autobytel dealers and approximately 1,200
are CarSmart dealers.
Approximately 400 dealers subscribe to both the
Autobytel.com and CarSmart.com services.
These dealers represent every major
domestic and imported make of vehicle and light truck sold in the United States
and Canada.
Dealerships are charged initial subscription fees and on-going fees,
principally on a monthly basis.

     
Pre-Owned CyberStore.
Autobytel launched its CyberStore program in April
1997.
The CyberStore allows consumers to search for a certified or non-certified
pre-owned vehicle according to specific search parameters such as the price,
make, model, mileage, year and location of the vehicle.
CyberStore locates and
displays the description, location and, if available, actual digital photograph
of vehicles that satisfy the search parameters.
The consumer can then complete a
formal purchase request for a specific vehicle and is contacted by the dealer to
conclude the sale.
To be listed in the CyberStore a certified pre-owned vehicle
must pass an extensive inspection and be covered by a 72-hour money-back
guarantee and a three-month, 3,000-mile warranty, which is honored nationally by
certified Pre-Owned CyberStore dealers.
Autobytel charges each vehicle dealer
that participates in the CyberStore program a separate additional monthly fee.

The CyberStore program uses the iManager and Dealer Real Time systems to provide
participating dealers online purchase requests shortly after submission by
consumers as well as the ability to track their inventory on a real-time basis.

     Service and Maintenance.
In June 1999, Autobytel launched a comprehensive
site designed to facilitate the service process for consumers.
The site is
designed to empower consumers with cost effective and efficient processes for
dealing with common service and maintenance issues.
The site enhances consumer
personalization.
It includes key components such as access to Autobytel
Accredited Service Centers and the ability to schedule service and maintenance
appointments online.
At the My Garage area consumers can store and receive
information about their cars and trucks, such as service reminders, recall
information and a lease watch to help keep track of mileage on a leased vehicle.

The site offers "Ask the Expert", a section that offers answers to frequently
asked service and maintenance questions.
In addition, the site offers travel and
weather information as well as maps.

     
Participating service centers must commit to respond to consumers within 24
hours with competitive no-haggle service prices.
The site enables dealers to use
the Internet to further serve their customers.

     
Other Related Products and Services.
Autobytel offers a number of related
products and services that it markets to consumers through its Web sites and the
linked Web sites of participating third party providers.
Autobytel makes
purchase and lease financing available to consumers through Peoplefirst that
allow consumers to research and apply for vehicle financing online in a secure
manner.
Consumers can apply for a loan or lease online at the time they submit
their purchase request for either a new or pre-owned vehicle.
Consumers are able
to arrive at the dealership with their loan pre-approved and their credit
verification documents in hand.
Autobytel believes that the convenience of
pre-approved purchase or lease financing, combined with a firm, competitive
price, enables dealers more easily to consummate purchase requests.
Peoplefirst
pays Autobytel a referral fee and an origination fee for most loans.

     
Autobytel provides a link on its Web sites so consumers can receive
real-time quotes for insurance coverage from Channelpoint Corporation and submit
quote applications online.
Participants in the program include The Hartford
(Hartford Financial Services Group, Inc.), The GE Auto Insurance Program and
Ekemper.
As of March 31, 2001, the service was available to consumers in 37
states and the District of Columbia.
Autobytel typically receives a marketing
fee for every quote application sent to a participating insurance company or
agent by a consumer accessing the Channelpoint Web site through its Web sites.

In addition, Autobytel provides Warrantybynet Inc.'s warranty products and
receive fees per warranty sold.

     
Autobytel offers information concerning all aspects of owning and leasing
new and pre-owned vehicles that it believes makes its Web sites valuable
resources to consumers.
Autobytel also offers a lease calculator and a loan
calculator to determine monthly payments and a lease or buy decision tool.

     
The iManager System.
In 1997, Autobytel launched a proprietary technology
and software system called the Dealer Real Time system.
The Dealer Real Time
system is an Internet-based communications platform that gives dealers a
competitive advantage compared to delivering purchase requests by fax.
In
January 2001 Autobytel launched iManager, an upgrade of the Dealer Real Time
system.

     
Using Internet technology, the iManager system enables the dealer to:

     - instantaneously access a consumer's vehicle purchase request as soon as
       the consumer submits it online,

     - consolidate Internet leads from multiple sources and showroom traffic in
       a single application,

     - track all interaction with the consumer,

     - accelerate dealer response time to consumers' online vehicle purchase
       requests,

     - send e-mail to consumers using a variety of predetermined templates,

     - access purchase requests through web-enabled cellular phones and wireless
       handheld devices,

     - input new and used vehicle inventory information for immediate display to
       consumers on Autobytel Web pages,

     - track dealership performance through a series of reports available
       online,

     - access Autobytel "news" and product information online, and

     - contact Autobytel technical support personnel via e-mail links.

     
CarSmart dealers use the SmarTrack dealer system.
Autobytel is currently
evaluating whether to standardize all of its dealers on a single system.

Revenues from Autobytel's customers outside of the United States were less
than 10% of total revenues for the years ended December 31, 2000 and December
31, 1999.


MARKETING AND SALES

     Autobytel's ability to enhance the recognition of its brand names,
domestically and internationally, and position itself as a leading
Internet-based vehicle information and automotive services provider is important
to its efforts to increase the number of vehicle purchase requests and requests
for ancillary services, as well as the number and quality of subscribing
dealerships.
Over the past several years, Autobytel has been the subject of
numerous newspaper, magazine, radio and television stories.
Articles about its
new vehicle program have appeared in Business Week, Fortune, Forbes, Time, and
The Wall Street Journal, among other publications.
Television stories featuring
Autobytel have been aired nationally on all major television networks.
Autobytel
believes that ongoing media coverage is an important element in creating
consumer awareness of its brand names and has contributed to dealership
awareness of, and participation in, Autobytel's programs.

     
Autobytel has established marketing and advertising programs with many of
the leading automotive information providers on the Internet, including
Edmund's, IntelliChoice and Kelley Blue Book which direct traffic to its Web
site and increase purchase requests.
Autobytel's agreements with automotive
information providers typically have a term of one year.

     
In the first quarter of 2001 and the year 2000, approximately 33% and 17%
of Autobytel's total purchase requests originated from StoneAge Corporation,
respectively.
Autobytel's agreement with StoneAge, pursuant to which it receives
referrals from StoneAge's Web site, is scheduled to expire in March 2002.

StoneAge provides Autobytel with the largest number of purchase requests other
than consumers visiting the Autobytel Web site directly.
Autobytel pays StoneAge
based on a per purchase request basis.

     
Autobytel's agreement with NBC Internet provides for anchor tenancy in the
New Car Center on its Web site, NBCi.com, as well as other promotions on its Web
site.
The agreement also provides for a co-branded Web site.
The agreement is
for a term of three years expiring in March 2002.
Autobytel pays NBCi annual and
monthly fees.

     
As of March 31, 2001, the aggregate minimum future payments under
Autobytel's agreements with Internet portals was $10.5 million.

     
During the first quarter of 2001 and the year 2000, Autobytel's total
Internet marketing and advertising costs incurred were $6.2 million and $20.6
million, respectively.
Annual, monthly and variable fees were $0.2 million, $1.5
million, and $4.5 million, respectively, in the first quarter of 2001 and $0.6
million, $7.5 million and $12.0 million, respectively, in the year 2000.
Setup
and initial fees in the year 2000 were $0.5 million.

     
Autobytel supplements its Internet presence with television, radio and
print advertising.
In late 1996, Autobytel began to broaden its marketing
efforts with a campaign to accelerate consumer awareness of the Autobytel brand
name and drive traffic to its Web site through cable television advertisements
featured on

CNN and CNET, Inc. and network television advertisements featured on NBC and
MSNBC.
Autobytel expects to continue to use television advertising to strengthen
its brand awareness.

     
In addition to Autobytel's consumer-oriented marketing activities, it also
markets its programs directly to dealerships, participates in trade shows,
advertises in trade publications and major automotive magazines and encourages
subscribing dealerships to recommend its program to other dealerships.


INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY

     Autobytel has registered service marks, including "Auto-By-Tel",
"Autobytel.com" and its "Autobytel.com logo" and has applied for additional
service marks and numerous patents.
Autobytel regards its trademarks, service
marks and brand names as important to its business.


DEALER RELATIONSHIPS AND SERVICES

     Dealer Network.
Dealers participate in Autobytel's networks by entering
into contracts with Autobytel.
Autobytel is converting its dealers to new
contracts with one-year terms that are terminable on 30 days' notice by either
party.
Autobytel's dealerships are located in most major metropolitan areas in
the United States and Canada.
As of March 31, 2001, the Autobytel participating
dealership base totaled approximately 3,500 dealers.
Dealerships pay initiation
and monthly fees to subscribe to Autobytel's online marketing program.
Both the
initial and monthly subscription fees are established in the contract and are
based upon many business factors including the type and location of the
franchise.
Autobytel reserves the right to raise its fees to dealers upon 30
days notice after the first six months of the term.
Autobytel does not prevent
dealers from entering into agreements with its competitors.

     
CarSmart's dealer agreements are generally for a term of three years and
are terminable on 30 days' notice by CarSmart.
As of March 31, 2001, the
CarSmart participating dealership base totaled approximately 1,200 dealers.

CarSmart's dealers pay initial, annual and monthly subscription fees.
CarSmart
reserves the right to revise fees after six months.
CarSmart is converting its
dealers to new contracts with one year terms and no annual fees.

     
As of March 31, 2001, dealers that participated in both the Autobytel and
CarSmart new vehicle purchasing services totaled approximately 400.

     Customer Support.
Autobytel actively monitors subscribing dealers through
ongoing customer surveys, and research conducted by its internal dealer support
group.
Generally, within 14 days after a consumer submits a purchase request
through one of Autobytel's Web sites, Autobytel re-contacts the consumer by
e-mail requesting completion of a quality assurance survey that allows Autobytel
to evaluate the sales process at participating dealers.
Additionally, Autobytel
performs telephone surveys of its customers to further support the information
gained from the written quality assurance surveys.
Dealerships that fail to
abide by Autobytel's program guidelines or who generate repeated consumer
complaints are reviewed and, if appropriate, terminated.
In return for requiring
a high level of consumer service, Autobytel assigns participating dealerships
exclusive territories.
Autobytel tries to assign dealers attractive territories
in order to increase participation in its program.

     
Each dealer agreement obligates the dealers to adhere to Autobytel's policy
of providing prompt responses to customers, no haggle pricing and full
disclosure regarding vehicle availability, add-ons and related matters.

Autobytel requires each dealer to have a manager whose principal responsibility
is supervising its system, similar to the way in which most dealers have a new
vehicle sales manager, pre-owned vehicle sales manager and service and parts
department managers who are responsible for those dealership functions.

Autobytel reserves the right to reduce or modify each dealer's assigned
territory after the first six months, although there can be no assurance that a
dealer whose territory is reduced or modified will not contest such a change or
terminate its subscription.
Autobytel cannot be sure that dealers whose
territories are reduced or modified by it will not pursue legal action against
it in an effort to prevent the change or recover damages.

     
Training.
Autobytel believes that dealers and their employees require
specialized training to learn the skills necessary to serve the Internet user
and take full advantage of Autobytel's proprietary systems.
Therefore, Autobytel
has developed an extensive training program for its dealers.
Autobytel believes
that this training is critical to enhancing its brand and reputation.
Autobytel
requires participating dealerships to have their representatives trained on its
system.
Training is conducted at Autobytel's headquarters in Irvine, California,
at regional training centers and at dealerships' premises.
In training its
dealers, Autobytel de-emphasizes traditional vehicle selling techniques and
emphasizes the Autobytel approach.
To increase consumer satisfaction and reduce
costs, Autobytel seeks to discourage dealerships from using commissioned and
multiple salespersons to interface with its customers.
In October 1999,
Autobytel formed I-Net Training Technologies LLC with third parties to provide
dealers with more extensive training and tools to facilitate Internet selling of
vehicles.
Such services are provided for a fee.


COMPETITION

     Autobytel believes that the principal competitive factors affecting the
market for Internet-based vehicle marketing services include:

     - brand name recognition,

     - speed and quality of fulfillment,

     - variety of related products and services,

     - ease of use,

     - customer satisfaction,

     - quality of service, and

     - technical expertise.

     
Autobytel's vehicle purchasing services compete against a variety of
Internet and traditional vehicle buying services, automotive brokers and
classifieds.
Many of such competitors are substantially better financed than
Autobytel is.
In the Internet-based market, Autobytel competes with other
entities which maintain similar commercial Web sites including AutoVantage,
Microsoft Corporation's CarPoint, CarsDirect.com, Cars.com and AutoTrader.com.

AutoNation, a large consolidator of dealers, has a Web site for marketing
vehicles.
Autobytel also competes indirectly against vehicle brokerage firms and
affinity programs offered by several companies, including Costco Wholesale
Corporation and Wal-Mart Stores, Inc.
In addition, all major vehicle
manufacturers have their own Web sites and many have launched online buying
services, such as General Motors Corporation's BuyPower and Ford Motor Company's
FordDirect.com.

     
Autobytel also competes with vehicle insurers, lenders and lessors as well
as individual dealerships.
Such companies may already maintain or may introduce
Web sites which compete with Autobytel's.
Autobytel cannot assure that it can
compete successfully against current or future competitors, many of which have
substantially more capital, resources and access to additional financing than it
does, nor can there be any assurance that competitive pressures faced by
Autobytel will not result in increased marketing costs, decreased Web site
traffic or loss of market share or otherwise will not materially and adversely
affect its business, results of operations and financial condition.
Autobytel
competes primarily on brand name recognition acquired through early entry into
the Internet-based automotive purchase referral market and through customer and
dealer satisfaction.


OPERATIONS AND TECHNOLOGY

     Autobytel believes that its future success is significantly dependent upon
its ability to continue to deliver high-performance and reliable Web sites,
enhance consumer/dealer communications, maintain the highest levels of
information privacy and ensure transactional security.
Autobytel currently hosts
its Web site at its data center.
Its data center includes redundant
infrastructure and network connections and is

located at Autobytel's headquarters in Irvine, California.
In the future,
Autobytel may host its infrastructure at a leading Application Service Provider.

Autobytel's network and computer systems are built on the leading industry
standards.
Network security is provided by utilizing standard products.

CarSmart's site is hosted by a third party.

     
System enhancements are primarily intended to accommodate increased traffic
across Autobytel's Web sites, improve the speed in which purchase requests are
processed and introduce new and enhanced products and services.
System
enhancements entail the implementation of sophisticated new technology and
system processes.


GOVERNMENT REGULATION

     Currently few laws or regulations have been adopted that apply directly to
Internet business activities.
The adoption of additional local, state, national
or international laws or regulations may decrease the growth of Internet usage
or the acceptance of Internet commerce.

     
Autobytel believes that its dealer marketing services do not constitute
franchising or vehicle brokerage activity in a way that makes franchise, motor
vehicle dealer, or vehicle broker licensing laws applicable to Autobytel.

Through a subsidiary, Autobytel is licensed as a motor vehicle dealer and
broker.
However, if individual state regulatory requirements change or
additional requirements are imposed on Autobytel, it may be required to modify
its service programs in such a state in a manner which may undermine its
program's attractiveness to consumers or dealers or not offer such service or
terminate its operations in such a state.
As Autobytel introduces new services,
it may need to comply with additional licensing regulations and regulatory
requirements.

     
Autobytel's services may result in changes in the way vehicles are
currently sold or may be viewed as threatening by new and pre-owned vehicle
dealers who do not subscribe to its programs.
Such businesses are often
represented by influential lobbying organizations, and such organizations or
other persons may propose legislation that, if adopted, could impact Autobytel's
evolving marketing and distribution model.

     
Other countries to which Autobytel expands its operations may have laws or
be subject to treaties that regulate the marketing, distribution, and sale of
vehicles.
As Autobytel considers specific foreign operations, it will need to
determine whether the laws of the countries in which it seeks to operate require
it to modify its program or otherwise change the Autobytel system or prohibit
the use of the system in such country entirely.
In addition, the laws of a
foreign country may impose licensing, bonding or similar requirements on
Autobytel as a condition to doing business there.

     
To date, Autobytel has not expended significant resources on lobbying or
related government affairs issues but may be required to do so in the future.

     
Franchise Classification.
If Autobytel's relationship or written agreement
with its dealers was found to be a "franchise" under federal or state franchise
laws, Autobytel could be subjected to additional regulations, including but not
limited to licensing, increased reporting and disclosure requirements.

Compliance with varied laws, regulations, and enforcement characteristics found
in each state may require Autobytel to allocate both staff time and monetary
resources, each of which may have an adverse affect on its results of
operations.
As an additional risk, if Autobytel's dealer relationship or
subscription agreement is determined to establish a franchise, Autobytel may be
subject to limitations on its ability to quickly and efficiently effect changes
in its dealer relationships in response to changing market trends, which may
negatively impact its ability to compete in the marketplace.

     
Autobytel believes that neither its relationship with its subscribing
dealers nor its dealer subscription agreements themselves constitute
"franchises" under federal or state franchise laws.
This belief has been upheld
by a Federal Appeals Court in Michigan that ruled Autobytel's business
relationship and its dealer subscription agreement does not rise to the level of
a "franchise" under Michigan law.

     
Vehicle Brokerage Activities.
Autobytel believes that state motor vehicles
dealer or broker licensing laws do not apply to it.
Through a wholly-owned
subsidiary, Autobytel is licensed as a motor vehicle dealer

and broker.
Autobytel may be required to pay administrative fees, fines, and
penalties for failure to comply with such licensing requirements.
Autobytel
believes that its dealer marketing referral service model does not qualify as an
automobile brokerage activity.

     
In response to concerns about its marketing referral program raised by the
Texas Department of Transportation, Autobytel modified its program in that state
to achieve compliance.
These modifications included a unique pricing model under
which all subscribing dealerships in Texas are charged uniform fees based on the
population density of their particular geographic area and opening its program
to all dealerships who wish to apply.

     
In the event that any other state's regulatory requirements impose state
specific requirements on Autobytel or include Autobytel within an
industry-specific regulatory scheme, Autobytel may be required to modify its
marketing programs in such states in a manner which may undermine the program's
attractiveness to consumers or dealers.
In the alternative, if Autobytel
determines that the licensing and related requirements are overly burdensome,
Autobytel may elect to terminate operations in such state.
In each case,
Autobytel's business, results of operations and financial condition could be
materially and adversely affected.

     
Financing Related Activities.
Autobytel provides a connection through its
Web sites that allows a consumer to obtain finance information and loan
approval.
Autobytel does not demand nor does it receive any fees from consumers
for this service.
In the event states require Autobytel to be licensed as a
financial broker, Autobytel intends to obtain such licenses.
Autobytel may be
unable to comply with a state's regulations affecting its current operations or
newly introduced services, or it could be required to incur significant fees and
expenses to license or be compelled to discontinue finance operations in those
states.

     
Insurance Related Activities.
Autobytel provides a link on its Web sites so
consumers can receive real time quotes for insurance coverage from Channelpoint
Corporation and submit quote applications online.
Participants in the program
include The Hartford (Hartford Financial Services Group, Inc.), The GE Auto
Insurance Program and Ekemper.
Autobytel typically receives a marketing fee for
every quote application sent to a participating insurance company or agent by a
consumer accessing the Channelpoint Web site through Autobytel's Web sites.

Autobytel receives no premiums from consumers nor does it charge consumers fees
for its services.
All applications are completed on Channelpoint's Web site.

     
Autobytel does not believe that its activity requires it to be licensed
under state insurance laws.
The use of the Internet in the marketing of
insurance products, however, is a relatively new practice.
It is not clear
whether or to what extent state insurance licensing laws apply to activities
similar to Autobytel's.
Given this uncertainty, Autobytel has proactively
applied for and currently holds, through a wholly-owned subsidiary, insurance
agent licenses or is otherwise authorized to transact insurance in 47 states and
the District of Columbia.

     As of April 30, 2001, Autobytel had a total of 250 employees, including 12

LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

     A.I.N. was sued on September 1, 1999 in a lawsuit entitled Robert Martins
v. Michael J. Gorun, A.I.N., Inc., et al., in Los Angeles Superior Court.
The
complaint contains causes of action for breach of written and oral contracts,
promissory estoppel, breach of fiduciary duty and fraud, and seeks damages and
equitable relief.
The plaintiff contends he is entitled to a 49.9% ownership
interest in A.I.N.'s CarSmart online business based on a purported agreement for
the formation of a company called CarSmart On-Line Services.
On December 14,
1999, A.I.N. filed a complaint for declaratory relief on the subject of Mr.
Martins' lawsuit in Contra Costa County Superior Court.
The Los Angeles action
has been transferred to Contra Costa County and the two cases have been
consolidated.
Autobytel was added as a cross defendant in such action.
The
lawsuit is and will be vigorously contested on behalf of Autobytel and A.I.N.

     The selling stockholders of A.I.N. are obligated to fully indemnify
Autobytel for all losses, including attorney's fees, expenses, settlements and
judgments, arising out of the lawsuit.
The indemnification obligation was
initially secured by 450,000 shares of Autobytel common stock transferred to the
selling stockholders as part of the acquisition of A.I.N., as well as $250,000
in cash.
As of April 30, 2001, the obligation was secured by the 373,068 shares
of common stock and $126,000 in cash after expenses.

     
On July 15, 1998, Autobytel and certain of its past and current officers
were sued by former employee Thomas Heshion in a lawsuit entitled Thomas
Heshion, et al. v. Auto-By-Tel Corporation, et al. in Orange County Superior
Court.
Plaintiff claimed that he was wrongfully terminated and that Autobytel
and its officers interfered with an oral agreement between plaintiff and another
co-worker for the purchase of the co-worker's Autobytel stock.
Summary judgment
was granted on the claims alleging interference with the alleged stock
agreement.
The remaining claims for wrongful termination were tried to a jury
which returned a verdict in December 2000 in favor of plaintiff in the amount of
$1.9 million.

     
Autobytel believes the judgement is in error and has retained new counsel
to handle the post-trial motions and, if necessary, the appeal.
Autobytel
intends to vigorously contest the judgment.

     
From time to time, Autobytel is involved in other litigation matters
relating to claims arising out of the ordinary course of business.
Autobytel is
involved in at least one such case currently.
Autobytel believes that there are
no claims or actions pending or threatened against it, the ultimate disposition
of which would have a material adverse effect on its business, results of
operations and financial condition.
However, if a court or jury rules against
Autobytel and the ruling is ultimately sustained on appeal and damages are
awarded against Autobytel, such ruling could have a material and adverse effect
on its business, results of operations and financial condition.

     AUTOBYTEL MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION
                           AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

     You should read the following discussion of Autobytel's results of
operations and financial condition in conjunction with Autobytel's consolidated
financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this joint proxy
statement/prospectus.
This discussion contains forward-looking statements based
on current expectations that involve risks and uncertainties.
Actual results and
the timing of certain events may differ significantly from those projected in
such forward-looking statements due to a number of factors, including those
discussed in the section entitled "Risk Factors" in this joint proxy statement/
prospectus.


OVERVIEW

     Autobytel is an internationally branded online automotive commerce company
that connects buyers and sellers together in an information-rich environment
throughout the vehicle ownership lifecycle, capturing revenue at multiple
stages.
Through Autobytel's Web sites, www.autobytel.com and www.carsmart.com,
consumers can research pricing, specifications and other information regarding
new and pre-owned vehicles and can purchase, finance, lease, insure, sell or
maintain their vehicles.
Autobytel believes that its services provide benefits
for consumers by supplying them with information to make informed and
intelligent vehicle decisions throughout the lifecycle of vehicle ownership.

Consumers can purchase new vehicles through its dealer referral networks.
In
addition, consumers can purchase pre-owned vehicles through Autobytel's
Pre-Owned CyberStore.

     
In January 2000, Autobytel announced the formation of Autobytel.
Europe with
initial investment from Inchcape plc, Pon Holdings B.V., GE Capital and e-LaSer.

The Netherlands-based Autobytel.
Europe plans to license, invest in and offer
joint services to national operating companies throughout Europe to localize the
Autobytel offerings.
In February 2000, Autobytel, St. George Bank Limited and
others joined in the formation of Autobytel Australia.
The Australian investors
joining Autobytel in the online venture are Trading Post, Astre Automotive, RACV
(Royal Automobile Club of Victoria), Fortis Insurance and Strathfield
E-Ventures.

     
In February 2000, Autobytel acquired A.I.N., the owner of CarSmart, a
leading online buying site for new and pre-owned vehicles, for 1.8 million
shares of Autobytel common stock and $3.0 million in cash.
As of March 31, 2001,
CarSmart had approximately 1,200 dealers, established relationships with more
than 200 credit unions and strategic marketing agreements with several of the
top Internet portals, including AOL.com, Alta Vista and GO2Net.
For the years
ended December 31, 1999 and 1998 CarSmart's unaudited revenues were $6.4 million
and $3.1 million, respectively.
For the years ended December 31, 1999 and 1998,
CarSmart's operating expenses were $7.6 million and $4.2 million, respectively.

CarSmart's unaudited net loss for the years ended December 31, 1999 and 1998 was
$1.3 million and $1.2 million, respectively.

     
In June 2000, Autobytel launched its MyGarage service area designed to
empower consumers by providing cost effective and efficient processes for
dealing with common service and maintenance issues.
The site enhances consumer
personalization and includes key components such as access to Autobytel
Accredited Service Centers, the ability to schedule service and maintenance
appointments online and receive information such as service reminders and recall
information.

     
In January 2001, Autobytel introduced iManager, a multi-functional dealer
management system and an upgrade of its Dealer Real Time system.
The iManager
system provides dealers with immediate purchase request information for new and
pre-owned vehicles, the ability to track multiple customers and purchase
requests, turnkey customer retention programs, automatic uploading of new and
pre-owned vehicle inventory into its database, reporting systems, including
transaction status, customer information and Internet department performance,
and other features.

     
In February 2001, Autobytel signed an agreement with General Motors
Corporation to conduct a 90-day test of a new GM online locate-to-order business
model.
The model involves modification of

Autobytel's existing Web site for consumers from the Washington, D.C.
metropolitan area.
The test program, which commenced on May 1, 2001, combines
the independent all makes, all models capability of Autobytel with a dealer-set
online e-price and locate-to-order vehicle inventory model for Chevrolet
vehicles.
Autobytel expects the project to be completed in the third quarter of
2001.

     
In April 2001, Autobytel entered into an acquisition agreement to acquire
Autoweb.
Under the terms of the acquisition agreement, each outstanding share of
common stock of Autoweb will be exchanged for 0.3553 shares of common stock of
Autobytel.
The acquisition is subject to a number of conditions, including the
approval of both the Autobytel and Autoweb stockholders.
The acquisition is
expected to close in the third quarter of 2001.

     
Autobytel derives the majority of its revenues from fees paid by
subscribing dealers, and it expects to be primarily dependent on its dealer
networks for revenues in the foreseeable future.
Dealers using Autobytel's
services pay initial subscription fees, as well as ongoing monthly fees based,
among other things, on the size of territory, demographics and indirectly, the
transmittal of purchase requests to them.
In the first quarter of 2001 and 2000,
program fees were $12.9 million and $12.1 million, respectively.
Program fees
were $12.9 million in the first quarter of 2001 and $54.0 million, $35.8 million
and $22.9 million in the years 2000, 1999 and 1998, respectively.
Average
monthly program fees per dealer were $880 in the first quarter of 2001 and $949,
$1,045 and $948 in 2000, 1999 and 1998, respectively.

     
Autobytel's dealer contract terms generally range from one to three years.

The majority of Autobytel's contracts are for a one year term.
Autobytel is
converting its remaining dealers primarily to new contracts with a one year
term.
The initial subscription fee from a dealer is recognized ratably over the
first twelve months of the dealer's contract.
Amortized revenues from initial
subscription fees were $0.5 million in the first quarter of 2001 and $2.8
million, $2.5 million and $2.4 million in the years 2000, 1999 and 1998,
respectively.
Monthly fees are recognized in the period the service is provided.

Monthly fee revenues were $12.3 million in the first quarter of 2001 and $50.9
million, $32.8 million and $18.2 million in the years 2000, 1999 and 1998,
respectively.
The amortized revenues from annual fees were $46,000 in the first
quarter of 2001 and $22,400, $0.5 million and $2.3 million in the years 2000,
1999 and 1998, respectively.

     
Autobytel also derives a portion of its revenues from related products and
services on a monthly fee and per transaction basis and from international
licensing and automotive consulting agreements.
In the first quarter of 2001 and
the years 2000, 1999 and 1998, revenues from related products and services were
$3.8 million, $12.5 million, $4.5 million and $0.9 million or 23%, 19%, 11% and
4% of total revenues, respectively.
In the first quarter of 2001, revenues from
related products and services include $1.4 million in consulting fees related to
the GM test program.
The consulting fees were accounted for using the percentage
of completion method of accounting.

     
Autobytel believes its ability to increase its revenues is directly related
to the number of subscribing dealers in its networks and the average monthly
fees paid by those dealers and indirectly related to the volume of purchase
requests routed through its Web sites.
Vehicle purchaser requests routed through
Autobytel's online systems were approximately 0.8 million and 0.7 million in the
first quarter of 2001 and 2000, respectively, or an increase of 20%
sequentially.
Vehicle purchase requests routed through its online systems were
approximately 0.8 million, 2.9 million, 2.1 million and 1.3 million in the first
quarter of 2001 and the years 2000, 1999 and 1998, respectively, or an increase
of 20%, 39%, 56% and 74% sequentially.
From inception through March 31, 2001,
Autobytel has directed approximately 8.2 million purchase requests to dealers.

     
Autobytel's revenue growth has been primarily dependent on its ability to:

     - increase the number of dealers,

     - increase the average monthly fees paid by each dealer,

     - deliver quality purchase requests to its dealer networks and

     - improve the sales conversion rate of dealer leads.

     
Autobytel believes its revenues in the foreseeable future will be dependent
on the above factors as well as its ability to generate revenues from related
products and services, including international licensing agreements and
transactions with automotive manufacturers.

     
In the first quarter of 2001, approximately 300 dealers were added to
Autobytel's North American dealer networks and approximately 700 dealers either
terminated their affiliation with Autobytel or were terminated by Autobytel.
The
net number of dealers as of March 31, 2001 decreased by 7.5% versus the same
quarter in 2000.
In 2000, approximately 3,500 dealers were added to Autobytel's
North American dealer networks, including approximately 1,500 which were added
as a part of the CarSmart acquisition, and approximately 1,800 dealers either
terminated their affiliation with Autobytel or were terminated by Autobytel.
The
net number of dealers as of December 31, 2000 increased by 52% over 1999.
As of
March 31, 2001, approximately 400 dealers subscribed to both the Autobytel and
CarSmart services.
The number of Autobytel's dealers fluctuates from time to
time and as of March 31, 2001, Autobytel had over 4,700 dealers.
Autobytel's
inability or failure to reduce dealer turnover could have a material adverse
effect on Autobytel's business, results of operations and financial condition.

     
Dealer participation in Autobytel's programs may terminate for various
reasons including:

     - extinction of the manufacturer brand,

     - selling of the dealer franchise,

     - termination of the franchise by the dealer,

     - termination by Autobytel, and

     - termination of Autobytel's service by the dealer.

     
Because Autobytel's primary revenue source is from program fees, its
business model is significantly different from many other Internet commerce
sites.
The automobiles requested through its site are sold by dealers; therefore
Autobytel derives no direct revenues from the sale of a vehicle and has no
significant cost of goods sold, no procurement, carrying or shipping costs and
no inventory risk.

     
Sales and marketing costs consist primarily of:

     - Internet marketing and advertising expenses,

     - fees paid to Autobytel's Internet affiliate network of purchase request
       providers,

     - promotion and advertising expenses to build its brand awareness and
       encourage potential customers to visit its Web sites and

     - personnel and other costs associated with sales, marketing, training and
       support of Autobytel's dealer network.

     
Autobytel uses Internet advertising, as well as traditional media, such as
television, radio and print.
The majority of its Internet advertising is
comprised of:

     - bounty fees paid to Autobytel's affiliate network,

     - sponsorship and alliance agreements with Internet portals and

     - advertising and marketing affiliations with online automotive information
       providers.

     
The Internet portals and online automotive information providers charge a
combination of set-up, initial, annual, monthly and variable fees.

     - Set-up fees are incurred for the development of the link between
       Autobytel and the Internet portal or online information provider and are
       expensed in the period the link is established.

     
- Initial and annual fees are amortized over the period they relate to.

     - Monthly fees are expensed in the month they relate to.

     
- Variable fees are fees paid for purchase requests and are expensed in the
       period the purchase requests are received.

     
Autobytel's Internet marketing and advertising costs, including set-up,
initial, annual, monthly and variable fees, were $6.2 million, $20.6 million,
$14.3 million and $11.1 million in the first quarter of 2001 and the years 2000,
1999 and 1998, respectively.
No set-up fees were incurred in the first quarter
of 2001 or 2000.
Also included in sales and marketing expenses are the costs
associated with signing up new dealers and their ongoing training and support.

Sales and marketing costs are recorded as an expense in the period the service
is provided.
Sales and marketing expenses have historically fluctuated
quarter-to-quarter due to varied levels of marketing and advertising and
Autobytel believes this will continue in the future.

THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2001 AND 2000

     Revenues.
Autobytel's revenues increased $1.6 million, or 10%, to $16.7
million in the first quarter of 2001, compared to $15.1 million in the first
quarter of 2000.
Program fees increased $0.8 million, or 6%.
The increase was
primarily due to a net $1.2 million increase as a result of the timing of the
CarSmart acquisition in mid February 2000, partially offset by the effect of a
decrease in CarSmart dealer count during the period.
The increase was also
partially offset by a $0.4 million, or 4%, decrease in Autobytel program fees
due to a reduction in Autobytel dealer count.

     
Revenues from related products and services increases by $0.8 million, or
27%.
The increase was primarily attributable to $1.4 million in consulting fees
from the GM test program recognized in the first quarter of 2001 offset by a
$0.6 million, or 20%, decrease in insurance, Web site advertising, data base
marketing and other fees.
Autobytel's revenues from related products and
services accounted for

approximately 23% of revenues in the first quarter of 2001 and 20% of revenues
in the first quarter of 2000.

     Sales and Marketing.
Sales and marketing expenses primarily include
advertising and marketing expenses paid to Autobytel's purchase request
providers and for developing Autobytel's brand equity, as well as personnel and
other costs associated with sales, training and support.
Sales and marketing
expense decreased by approximately $3.6 million, or 21%, to $13.3 million in the
first quarter of 2001 compared to $16.9 million in the first quarter of 2000.

The decrease was primarily due to a $6.4 million, or 68%, decrease in print,
television and radio advertising partially offset by an increase in online
advertising of $2.8 million, or 82%.
Autobytel continues to refine its marketing
strategy to reduce its cost of customer acquisition.

     
Product and Technology Development.
Product and technology development
expense decreased by $1.0 million, or 21%, to $4.0 million in the first quarter
of 2001 compared to $5.0 million in the first quarter of 2000.
The decrease was
primarily due to a $1.2 million, or 73%, decrease in software development costs
which was partially offset by an increase of $0.2 million, or 5%, for additional
personnel and retention costs, both domestic and international, and Web site
data content and licensing fees.
In accordance with Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 86, "Accounting for the Costs of Computer
Software to be Sold, Leased or Otherwise Marketed", Autobytel capitalized $2.3
million of software development costs in the first quarter of 2001, which were
primarily related to the enhancement of Autobytel's existing proprietary
software for use by its international licensees.

     
General and Administrative.
General and administrative expense was $3.6
million and $2.8 million for the first quarter of 2001 and 2000, respectively.

General and administrative expense increased by $2.8 million, or 30%.
The
increase was primarily due to a $0.6 million, or 391%, increase in legal and
professional fees for general corporate expenses, and a $0.2 million, or 101%,
increase for goodwill amortization related to Autobytel's acquisition of
CarSmart in February 2000.

     
Restructuring costs.
Restructuring costs of $1.0 million represent expenses
related to the reorganization of Autobytel's dealer operations, including
personnel costs, elimination of duplicate facilities and the write-down of fixed
assets in the first quarter of 2001.

     
Interest Income, Net.
In the first quarter of 2001, interest income
decreased by $0.4 million, or 24%, compared to 2000.
Interest income decreased
due to lower cash balances and interest rates.

     
Foreign Currency Exchange Gain, Net.
Autobytel.
Europe, a subsidiary of
Autobytel, operates its business in Europe.
As such, it incurs general operating
expenses and enters into transactions which require the use of local foreign
currencies.
Due to foreign exchange rate fluctuations, a $0.4 million gain on
cash held in foreign currency was realized in the first quarter of 2001.
Foreign
exchange transaction gains and losses in the first quarter of 2001 were $0.3
million.
In the future, Autobytel may experience gains or losses attributable to
fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates.

     
Equity Losses in Unconsolidated Subsidiary.
Equity losses in an
unconsolidated subsidiary represent Autobytel's share of losses in its
Australian venture.
The losses recognized have been limited to the amount of
Autobytel's investment.

     
Income allocable to Minority Interest.

share of net income or losses attributable to the minority shareholders in
majority owned subsidiaries.
In the first quarter of 2001, $0.1 million in
income related to Autobytel's subsidiary, Autobytel.
Europe, was allocated to the
minority shareholders.
