Background of the Merger

   As a regular part of their business plans, Kana and Broadbase have from time
to time each considered opportunities for expanding and strengthening their
technology, products, research and development capabilities and distribution
channels, including strategic acquisitions, business combinations, investments,
licensing and development agreements and joint ventures.

   
Between late December 1999 and the end of February 2000, Michael J.
McCloskey, Kana's former chief executive officer, and Chuck Bay, president and
chief executive officer of Broadbase, engaged in discussions regarding a
potential strategic business combination.
During that time, various members of
the Broadbase management team met with members of Kana's management team to
conduct business due diligence and to discuss the potential benefits of a
business combination, and representatives of the two companies communicated
regarding possible terms of a transaction.
However, the parties did not reach
agreement on proposed terms.
From time to time from April 2000 to December
2000, Mr. McCloskey and Mr. Bay occasionally communicated regarding their
businesses and potential relationships between the companies.

   
At various times between April 2000 and March 2001, Mr. Bay and other
representatives of Broadbase also held preliminary discussions with several
other companies with respect to potential acquisitions of Broadbase or
potential mergers involving Broadbase, some of which parties conducted
financial, legal and technical due diligence on Broadbase.
However, Broadbase
did not reach agreement with any of these companies as to valuation or other
material terms of any potential mergers or acquisitions, and the parties did
not engage in negotiations of definitive agreements for any such transactions.

   
At various times between April 2000 and March 2001, Mr. McCloskey, and James
C. Wood, his successor as chief executive officer, and other representatives of
Kana also held preliminary discussions with other companies with respect to
potential acquisitions of Kana or potential mergers involving Kana, some of
which parties conducted financial, legal and technical due diligence on Kana.

However, Kana did not reach agreement with any of these companies as to
valuations or other material forms of any potential mergers or acquisitions,
and the parties did not engage in negotiations of definitive agreements in any
such respects.

   
During the last week of March 2001, Mr. Wood contacted Mr. Bay to discuss
the respective businesses of Kana and Broadbase and to determine whether
Broadbase would be interested in resuming discussions regarding a business
combination with Kana.
Over the next several days, Mr. Wood and Mr. Bay engaged
in preliminary discussions regarding the nature of a possible business
combination between Kana and Broadbase and the potential of the combined
enterprise.

   
At a special meeting of the board held on the evening of March 30, 2001,
Kana's board of directors received an update from Mr. Wood and other officers
of Kana on Kana's business and financial condition, its remaining cash and cash
expenditure rate, and its competitive outlook in the marketplace.
Kana's board
decided to evaluate various strategic transactions, including a potential
business combination with Broadbase and other potential strategic transactions
with several companies with respect to which Kana had received informal
inquiries but had not yet received formal offers or indications of interest.

Among these companies were Company A, a large Nasdaq-listed enterprise software
applications provider, and Company B, a large, Nasdaq-listed communications
hardware and software provider.
Kana's board instructed Mr. Wood to contact
Goldman,

Sachs & Co. in connection with the proposed strategic transactions.
In
addition, Kana's board authorized Mr. Wood to continue evaluating potential
strategic transactions, including further discussions with Broadbase, Company A
and Company B.

   On April 2 and April 3, 2001, Kana's board held two special meetings to
review the status of the strategic transactions available to Kana.
Kana's board
discussed the merits of potential strategic business combinations with
Broadbase, Company A and Company B and certain other companies in the software
industry and communications industry.
The discussions included the strategic
benefits that could be achieved in a combination of the companies' products and
services, management and sales organizations and the possibility of obtaining
interim financing in connection with any such transaction.
Kana's board also
discussed potential headcount and cost reductions.
Mr. Wood reported to the
board that additional discussions had been held with representatives of Company
A and Company B and it was likely that Kana would receive a proposal for a
strategic transaction from one or both companies in the near future.

Representatives of Goldman Sachs and Brobeck, Phleger & Harrison LLP, Kana's
outside legal counsel, attended the meetings.
On April 3, 2001, Kana's board
agreed to formally retain Goldman Sachs as its financial advisor in connection
with the potential strategic transactions.

   
On April 2 and April 3, 2001, Mr. Wood and Mr. Bay continued to discuss the
benefits of a strategic transaction between Kana and Broadbase, the benefits of
combining the companies, the possibility of interim financing, and valuation
expectations.

   
On April 3 and April 4, 2001, Kana and Broadbase, respectively, announced
their preliminary results of operations for the first quarter of 2001.

   
On April 5, 2001, Eric Willgohs, Broadbase's Vice President, Legal and
General Counsel, contacted Fenwick & West LLP, Broadbase's outside legal
counsel, and Morgan Stanley & Co.
Incorporated regarding the proposed merger,
and Broadbase, consulting with representatives of Morgan Stanley and Fenwick,
prepared a draft term sheet to be submitted to Kana.

   
On April 5, 2001, the Broadbase board of directors held a special meeting to
review the discussions with Kana.
Broadbase's board discussed potential
benefits and risks of the proposed transaction with Kana, as well as the
anticipated operating results of the combined company.
Representatives of
Fenwick discussed specific terms of the proposed transaction with Kana,
including the proposed exchange ratio, the proposed interim financing of Kana,
the proposed stock option agreements and voting agreements, the proposed
management and board of directors of the combined company, the terms of the
non-solicitation covenants, and the terms of the proposed license agreement,
and the duties of the Broadbase board with respect to the proposed transaction.

Broadbase's board authorized management to proceed with its discussions with
Kana.
In addition, Broadbase's board agreed to formally retain Morgan Stanley
as its financial advisor in connection with the proposed transaction.

   
On April 5, 2001, Kana's board held a special meeting to review the status
of discussions with Broadbase, Company A and Company B as well as other
possible strategic transactions.
Kana's board reviewed and discussed the draft
term sheet which had been delivered on behalf of Broadbase.
Kana's board also
reviewed and discussed a letter of interest that had been received by Kana
indicating the basic terms of a possible transaction with Company A. Mr. Wood
reported that it was likely that a formal offer would be made by Company B in
the next 48-72 hours, but that the offer was likely to be for a strategic
investment, rather than a business combination.
Representatives of Brobeck and
Goldman Sachs also attended and participated in this meeting.
Among the factors
Kana's board considered in evaluating potential transactions with each of
Broadbase, Company A and Company B were the comparative market capitalizations,
revenue potential, liquidity, possibility of interim financing, infrastructures
and product fit of each potential partner, as well as the timeline on which a
transaction could be concluded.
Representatives of Brobeck then discussed
specific aspects of the proposed transaction with Broadbase, including the
proposed restrictions on the conduct of Kana's business, the proposed
management of Kana following the merger, the terms of the non-solicitation
covenants,

the termination sections and the consequences of termination, the operation of
the stock option agreements, the terms of the voting agreements, and the
possible terms of an interim loan from Broadbase.
Based on the relative merits
offered by each potential transaction, Kana's board determined that it would
move forward with negotiating definitive documents with Broadbase based on the
term sheet reviewed at the meeting, but that it would entertain further
discussions with Company A and/or Company B should a formal offer from one or
both companies be forthcoming.

   
On April 5, 2001, Kana and Broadbase entered into a non-disclosure
agreement, and Broadbase instructed Fenwick to prepare drafts of the merger
agreement and other transaction documents.
Later that evening, Brobeck and
representatives of Company A's outside legal counsel negotiated a nondisclosure
agreement, which was then executed by Kana and Company A.

   Beginning on the morning of April 6, 2001 and continuing through April 8,
2001, a series of meetings was held at the offices of Fenwick between
marketing, legal, operations, technical and finance personnel, accountants and
financial advisors of both companies for the purpose of conducting due
diligence.
Representatives from Brobeck and Fenwick also conducted a legal due
diligence review.
On the evening of April 6, 2001, Fenwick distributed a draft
of a merger agreement and other draft transaction documents to the working
group for the transaction.

   
On April 7, 2001, Brobeck provided its initial comments on the draft merger
agreement and other draft transaction documents previously distributed by
Fenwick.

   
In the early evening of April 7, 2001, Broadbase's board of directors held a
special meeting to review the status of the discussions with Kana.
The board
discussed the proposed plan for headcount reductions at both companies, the
financial condition, liquidity and anticipated results of operations of
Broadbase and Kana, and the cost structure and anticipated potential results of
operations of the combined company.
Representatives of Morgan Stanley attended
and discussed the financial performance of Kana and Broadbase and current
economic and industry conditions.
The board then discussed the likelihood of
alternative transactions that Broadbase could pursue.
Representatives of
Fenwick also attended and advised the Broadbase board of its fiduciary duties
in considering the merger and reviewed the principal terms of the revised draft
merger agreement and related agreements.
Broadbase's board discussed the
principal terms of the proposed transaction, including the proposed exchange
ratio, the requirement that Broadbase provide Kana with up to $20 million in
unsecured loans, and the operation and terms of the proposed distribution and
license agreement, the proposed voting agreements and the proposed stock option
agreements.
Broadbase's board authorized management to continue its
negotiations with Kana.

   
In the early evening of April 7, 2001, Kana's board held a special meeting
to discuss the status of the potential strategic transactions available to
Kana.
Mr. Wood noted that in the afternoon, Kana had received a proposal from
Company A for an acquisition of Kana and a proposal from Company B for a
strategic investment in Kana.
Representatives of Goldman Sachs attended the
meeting and discussed selected financial attributes of Kana, Broadbase and
Company A. Representatives of Goldman Sachs also participated in discussions
with the board with respect to the terms of the proposals from Company A and
Company B.
After further discussion, Kana's board determined that,
notwithstanding the strength and resources of Company B, a business combination
with Broadbase was preferable to operating independently following an
investment by Company B because of the perceived strategic fit between Kana's
and Broadbase's businesses and product lines.
Kana's board determined that
Company B's proposal had a number of disadvantages and did not offer as much
value to Kana and its stockholders as a combination with Broadbase.
Mr. Wood
also noted that Company B had indicated that it was not interested in a
business combination with Kana in the near term.
Kana's board then determined
to defer further discussions with Company B.

   Kana's board then considered the terms of the alternative proposal from
Company A as compared with the Broadbase proposal.
Kana's board noted that the
alternative proposal from Company A was subject to a due diligence
investigation that had not yet begun and the drafting and negotiating of
definitive agreements, and

weighed these factors in light of the relative certainty associated with the
relatively more completed process with Broadbase, and the attractiveness of the
interim funding aspect of the Broadbase proposal, in light of Kana's cash
position.
The Company A proposal was further weighed against the possibility
that Broadbase might have been unwilling to proceed on the terms then under
discussion if Kana continued to engage in discussions with Company A. Kana's
board viewed the Broadbase transaction as more attractive than the alternative
proposal from Company A both because of the proposed terms of the respective
transactions and because it believed that Broadbase's financial position,
products, services, management and sales organizations provided a more
favorable strategic fit with Kana than a combination with Company A. Kana's
board also considered that a definitive merger agreement with Broadbase would
contain provisions allowing Kana to consider and respond to future unsolicited
proposals from Company A, Company B, or any other party if Kana's board made a
finding that it was required to do so to comply with its fiduciary duties to
its stockholders, subject to the payment to Broadbase of a $2.5 million merger
termination fee and other provisions.

   
Representatives of Brobeck discussed with, and answered questions from, the
Kana board regarding the Kana board's legal duties and responsibilities in
connection with considering the proposed business combination with Broadbase
and reviewed the principal terms of the revised draft merger agreement and
related agreements.
The Kana board discussed certain business issues in the
proposed transaction with Broadbase, including the proposed exchange ratio, the
merger consideration, treatment of Broadbase employees following the proposed
transaction, acceleration of Broadbase stock options, management of the
combined companies and industry competition.
The Kana board also reviewed
certain legal issues relating to the proposed transaction with Broadbase,
including termination rights, the operation of the stock option agreements and
the operation of the distribution and license agreement.
The Kana board also
discussed a proposed headcount reduction of Kana and the timing of such a
reduction if implemented.
After lengthy discussion, the Kana board decided to
continue negotiating with Broadbase, subject to review of the revised merger
agreement and revised related agreements.

   
During the evening of April 7, 2001 and the morning of April 8, 2001,
representatives of Brobeck and Fenwick held a series of negotiations concerning
the terms of the draft merger agreement and the other draft related agreements
by teleconference and at the offices of Fenwick.
The terms discussed in these
negotiations included, among other things, the representations and warranties
made by the parties, the restrictions on the conduct of their business, the
terms of the non-solicitation covenants and other material covenants, the
termination provisions, the provisions regarding payment of the termination
fees and the consequences of termination, the conditions to closing and the
definition of adverse events that would not prevent the closing of the
transaction, and the terms and conditions of the revolving loan agreement, the
distribution and license agreement, the stock option agreements and the voting
agreements.

   
On the afternoon of April 8, 2001, Fenwick distributed revised drafts of the
proposed merger agreement and other related agreements and Brobeck provided
comments on these draft agreements.
Throughout the evening of April 8, 2001,
representatives of Brobeck and Fenwick continued to negotiate the terms of
these agreements by teleconference and at the offices of Fenwick.
Thereafter,
Fenwick distributed revised agreements.

   
The Kana board held a special meeting in the evening on April 8, 2001 to
review and approve the terms of the merger with Broadbase.
Mr. Rodriguez,
Kana's Interim Chief Financial Officer, updated the board on Kana's financial
position, including its cash position.
Representatives of Brobeck briefed the
Kana board regarding the board's legal duties and responsibilities in
connection with considering the merger, and again reviewed the results of the
parties' further negotiations, the principal terms of the merger agreement and
the related agreements.
Representatives of Goldman Sachs attended the meeting
and discussed the financial performance of Kana and Broadbase, the current
financial market environment, the stock trading patterns of Kana and Broadbase
as well as other companies in the software industry and the financial impact of
the proposed merger.
Goldman Sachs later delivered its oral opinion to Kana's
board that, as of such date, and subject to a number of assumptions,
qualifications and limitations which are set forth in the written opinion
attached as Appendix VIII to this joint proxy statement/prospectus, the
exchange ratio of 1.05 shares of Kana

common stock to be exchanged for each share of Broadbase common stock pursuant
to the merger agreement was fair from a financial point of view to Kana.

Following the discussions, Kana's board unanimously determined that the
proposed merger was advisable, fair to, and in the best interests of, Kana and
its stockholders and approved the terms of the merger agreement and related
agreements and the issuance of Kana stock in the merger and authorized Mr. Wood
to execute, on behalf of Kana, the merger agreement and related agreements,
subject to any non-material changes that Mr. Wood was empowered to negotiate.

In addition, the Kana board gave further consideration to the proposed plan for
reduction of Kana's headcount, including the impact of this plan if the merger
was not consummated, the impact of this plan on Kana's anticipated costs and
revenues, and the viability of further headcount reductions.
The Kana board
then unanimously approved the proposed headcount reduction plan.

   
In the evening on April 8, 2001, the Broadbase board of directors held a
special meeting to review and approve the terms of the proposed merger.

Representatives of Morgan Stanley and Fenwick were present.
Morgan Stanley
delivered its oral opinion to Broadbase's board that, as of that date, the
exchange ratio of 1.05 shares of Kana common stock to be exchanged for each
share of Broadbase common stock pursuant to the merger was fair to Broadbase's
stockholders from a financial point of view.
Fenwick advised Broadbase's

board regarding the board's legal duties and responsibilities considering the
merger, and again reviewed the principal terms of the merger agreement and the
related agreements.
Following the discussions, Broadbase's board unanimously
determined that the proposed merger was advisable, fair to, and in the best
interests of, Broadbase and its stockholders and approved the terms of the
merger agreement and related agreements and authorized Mr. Bay to execute, on
behalf of Broadbase, the merger agreement and related agreements, subject to
any non-material changes that Mr. Bay was empowered to negotiate.
In addition,
Broadbase's board considered Broadbase's proposed headcount reduction plan,
including the impact of this plan if the merger was not consummated, the impact
of the plan on Broadbase's anticipated costs and revenues, and the viability of
further headcount reductions.
After discussion, Broadbase's board unanimously
approved the proposed headcount reduction plan.

   
Representatives of Brobeck and Fenwick then proceeded to complete
negotiations on the remaining terms of the merger agreement and the related
agreements.

   
Early in the morning on April 9, 2001, Kana and Broadbase entered into the
merger agreement, the stock option agreements, the revolving loan agreement and
the distribution and license agreement.
Also on April 9, 2001, certain
stockholders of Kana entered into voting agreements with Broadbase and certain
Broadbase stockholders entered into voting agreements with Kana, and agreed to
vote their shares in favor of the transaction.
Kana and Broadbase then issued a
joint press release announcing the signing of the merger agreement and held a
conference call to discuss the merger with interested investors and analysts.


Kana's Reasons for the Merger and Recommendation of Kana's Board of Directors

   Kana's Reasons for the Merger.
On April 8, 2001, Kana's board of directors
unanimously concluded that the merger was in the best interests of Kana and its
stockholders, and recommended that the stockholders approve the issuance of
shares of Kana common stock in the merger.
This decision was based upon several
potential benefits of the merger that Kana's board believes will contribute to
the success of the combined company.
These potential benefits from combining
Broadbase with Kana include:

  .
the opportunity to preserve and enhance stockholder value by combining
    two complementary businesses;

  .
access to Broadbase's cash reserves to help fund Kana's operations;

  .
expanding Kana's technology leadership by providing a web-architected e-
    Business platform and a comprehensive suite of customer-facing
    applications;

  .
the combination of products that could provide the platform for linking
    business-to-consumer and business-to-business functions within an e-
    Business;

  .
the complementary nature of each company's product offering as an
    extension of the offering of the other company;

  .
increased distribution channels for Kana's product through Broadbase's
    portfolio of partners;

  .
the expectation that the combined company would wield a stronger
    management team;

  .
increased distribution channels for Broadbase's products through Kana's
    base of customers;

  .  
increased product diversification and penetration of each company's
     customer base;

  .
a reduction in operating expense that would result from combining
    functionalities of Kana and Broadbase and eliminating redundancies;

  .  
Broadbase's leadership position in its market;

  .  
the opportunity for expanded research and development of the combined
     product offering, including potential new product offerings; and

  .  
an increase in the size of Kana's market.

   
Kana's board reviewed a number of factors in evaluating the merger,
including, but not limited to, the following:

  .  
information concerning Broadbase's business, financial performance and
     condition, particularly its cash position, operations, technology and
     management;

  .
the timing of the interim financing;

  .  
the strength of Broadbase's management team;

  .  
information concerning the financial condition, results of operations
     and businesses of Kana and Broadbase before and after giving effect to
     the merger;

  .  
current financial market conditions and historical market prices,
     volatility and trading information with respect to Kana common stock and
     Broadbase common stock;

  .  
the consideration Kana will issue in the merger in light of comparable
     merger transactions;

  .  
the belief that the terms of the merger agreement and related agreements
     are reasonable;

  .  
the impact of the merger on the customers and employees of Kana and the
     combined company;

  .  
Kana's management's view as to the integration of Broadbase;

  .  
results of the due diligence investigation conducted by Kana's
     management, accountants, financial advisors and legal counsel;

  .  
Kana's intention to account for the merger as a purchase;

  .  
the expectation that the merger would be a tax free transaction;

  .  
the percentage ownership of the combined company of Kana's stockholders;

  .  
possible alternative means of achieving the anticipated benefits of the
     merger, including the possibility of a combination with other companies
     and possible strategic alliances that would not involve a combination;

  .
advice of Kana's outside legal counsel, on the proposed terms of the
    merger agreement.

  .  
the restrictions posed by the non-solicitation, stockholder vote and
     termination provisions of the merger agreement and the effect that these
     provisions might have on Kana's ability to respond to a superior offer
     from a third party and directors' ability to discharge their fiduciary
     duties;

  .  
the terms of the revolving loan agreement, stock option agreement and
     the distribution and license agreement and Kana's evaluation of the
     likelihood that another company would propose an alternative transaction
     with or without the existence of these terms; and

  .  
the analyses performed by Goldman Sachs & Co., and its opinion (the full
     text of which is attached as Appendix VIII to this joint proxy
     statement/prospectus) to the effect that, as of April 9, 2001, and
     subject to a number of qualifications, assumptions and limitations set
     forth in the opinion, the exchange ratio in the merger agreement was
     fair from a financial point of view to Kana.

   
The Kana board also identified and considered a number of potentially
negative factors in its deliberations concerning the merger including the
following:

  .  
the risk that the potential benefits of the merger may not be realized;

  .  
the risk that the merger may not be consummated, notwithstanding the
     voting agreements obtained from holders representing beneficial
     ownership (including shares issuable upon the exercise of options or
     exercisable within 60 days of April 9, 2001) of approximately 11.7% of
     Broadbase's common stock and holders of 20.4% of Kana's common stock as
     of April 9, 2001;

  .  
the risk of management and employee disruption associated with the
     merger, including the risk that despite the efforts of the combined
     company, key technical, sales and management personnel might not remain
     employed by the combined company;

  .  
the risk that Broadbase and Kana would not be able to integrate their
     respective products, technology and organizations;

  .  
the anticipated impact of the merger on Kana's customers, strategic
     partners and employees and their expected reaction to the announcement
     of the merger;

  .  
the potential effect of the termination fee and the terms of the
     revolving loan agreement, the distribution and license agreement and the
     stock option agreement negotiated by Kana in deterring other potential
     acquirors from proposing an alternative transaction that might be more
     advantageous to Kana stockholders;

  .  
the risk that if the merger is not completed, Kana would have borrowed
     substantial sums from Broadbase, implemented significant reductions in
     its workforce, incurred other significant costs in contemplation of the
     merger, granted an option to purchase a substantial amount of its
     capital stock to a competitor, and granted a worldwide five-year license
     to all of its intellectual property to Broadbase at a favorable price,
     and that these actions could weaken it as an independent company if the
     merger were not completed; and

  .  
other applicable risks described in this joint proxy
     statement/prospectus under "Risk Factors.
"

   In addition, Kana's board of directors considered the interests that its
officers and directors may have with respect to the merger in addition to their
interests as Kana stockholders.

   
Kana's board concluded, however, that some of these risks were unlikely to
occur, that others could be mitigated, and on balance, the merger's potential
benefits to Kana and its stockholders outweighed the associated risks.
The
discussion of the information and factors considered by Kana's board is not
intended to be exhaustive.
In view of the variety of factors considered in
connection with its evaluation of the merger, Kana's board did not find it
practicable to, and did not quantify or otherwise assign relative weight to,
the specific factors considered in reaching its determination.

   
Recommendation of Kana's Board of Directors.
For the reasons discussed
above, Kana's Board of Directors has determined the merger agreement and the
merger to be advisable and fair to and in the best interests of Kana and its
stockholders.
Kana's Board of Directors unanimously recommends that Kana
stockholders vote for approval of the issuance of Kana common stock in the
merger.


Opinion of Kana's Financial Advisor

   On April 8, 2001, Goldman Sachs delivered its oral opinion to the board of
directors of Kana that, as of such date, the exchange ratio was fair from a
financial point of view to Kana.
Goldman Sachs subsequently confirmed its oral
opinion by delivery of its written opinion dated April 9, 2001.

   
The full text of the written opinion of Goldman Sachs, dated April 9, 2001,
which sets forth assumptions made, matters considered and limitations on the
review undertaken in connection with the opinion, is attached as Appendix VIII.

Goldman Sachs provided its opinion for the information and assistance of Kana's
board of directors in connection with its consideration of the merger.
The
Goldman Sachs opinion is not a recommendation as to how any holder of Kana
common stock should vote with respect to the merger.
Kana urges you to read the
opinion in its entirety.

   
In connection with its opinion, Goldman Sachs reviewed, among other things:

  .  
the merger agreement;

  .  
the registration statements on Form S-1 of Kana and Broadbase relating
     to the initial public offering of the Kana common stock and the
     Broadbase common stock, respectively;

  .  
annual reports to stockholders and annual reports on Form 10-K of Kana
     and Broadbase for the two years ended December 31, 2000;

  .  
certain interim reports to stockholders and quarterly reports on Form
     10-Q of Kana and Broadbase;

  .  
certain other communications from Kana and Broadbase to their respective
     stockholders; and

  .  
certain internal financial analyses and forecasts for Kana and Broadbase
     prepared by their respective managements, including certain cost savings
     and operating synergies projected by the managements of Kana and
     Broadbase to result from the merger.

   
Goldman Sachs also held discussions with members of the senior management of
Kana and Broadbase regarding their assessment of the strategic rationale for,
and the potential benefits of, the transaction contemplated by the merger
agreement and the past and current business operations, financial condition and
future prospects of their respective companies, including the current and
projected availability of cash for each of Kana and Broadbase.
In addition,
Goldman Sachs:

  .  reviewed the reported price and trading activity for the Kana common
     stock and the Broadbase common stock;

  .  
compared certain financial and stock market information for Kana and
     Broadbase with similar information for certain other companies the
     securities of which are publicly traded;

  .  
reviewed the financial terms of certain recent business combinations in
     the software industry specifically and in other industries generally;
     and

  .  
performed such other studies and analyses as Goldman Sachs considered
     appropriate.

   
Goldman Sachs relied upon the accuracy and completeness of all of the
financial, accounting and other information discussed with or reviewed by it
and assumed such accuracy and completeness for purposes of rendering its
opinion.
In that regard, Goldman Sachs assumed, with the consent of Kana's
board of directors, that the internal financial forecasts prepared by the
managements of Kana and Broadbase, including any synergies, were reasonably
prepared on a basis reflecting the best currently available estimates and
judgments of Kana and Broadbase.
Goldman Sachs did not make an independent
evaluation or appraisal of the assets and liabilities of Kana or Broadbase or
any of their respective subsidiaries and was not furnished with any such
evaluation or appraisal.
The opinion of Goldman Sachs does not address the
relative merits of the transaction contemplated by the merger agreement as
compared to any alternative business transaction that might be, or might have
been, available to Kana.

   
The advisory services and opinion of Goldman Sachs were provided for the
information and assistance of the board of directors of Kana in connection with
its consideration of the merger, and the opinion does not constitute a
recommendation as to how any holder of Kana common stock should vote with
respect to the merger.

   
The following is a summary of the material financial analyses used by
Goldman Sachs in connection with providing its oral opinion to Kana's board of
directors on April 8, 2001.
Goldman Sachs utilized substantially the same type
of financial analyses in connection with providing the written opinion attached
hereto as Appendix VIII.
Some of the summaries of the financial analyses
include information presented in tabular format.
In order to more fully
understand the financial analyses used by Goldman Sachs, the tables must be
read together with the full text of each summary.
The tables alone are not a
complete description of Goldman Sachs' financial analyses.

   
(1) Exchange Ratio and Price Premium Analysis.
Goldman Sachs calculated (i)
the average ratio of the closing price of the Broadbase common stock to the
closing price of the Kana common stock for selected time periods ending on
April 6, 2001 and (ii) the implied premium being paid in the merger based on
the exchange ratio in the merger of 1.05 shares of Kana common stock for each
share of Broadbase common stock as compared to such historical average price
ratios.
Goldman Sachs also calculated (i) the average closing price of the
Broadbase common stock for selected time periods ending on April 6, 2001 and
(ii) the implied premium being paid in the merger based on the value of the
Kana common stock to be exchanged for each share of Broadbase common stock
(based on the exchange ratio in the merger and the closing price of the Kana
common stock on April 6, 2001) as compared to such historical average prices of
the Broadbase common stock.
The results of such analysis are set forth below:

   (2) Cash Position Analysis.
Goldman Sachs analyzed the amount of cash
currently held by each of Kana and Broadbase and the pro forma cash to be held
by the combined company, and calculated the amount of cash per fully-diluted
share outstanding for each of Kana, Broadbase and the combined company.
The
results of such analysis are set forth below.

In addition, for purposes of comparison with the pro forma cash per fully-
diluted share of the combined company, Goldman Sachs analyzed the cash per
fully-diluted Kana share that would result from a primary offering of Kana
common stock.
Goldman Sachs performed such analysis using various assumptions
with respect to the discount to Kana's April 6, 2001 closing share price at
which shares could be issued in such an offering.
For each scenario, Goldman
Sachs calculated (i) the amount of cash that could be raised in an offering in
which Kana's current stockholders retained a 51.7% ownership percentage in Kana
subsequent to the offering (51.7% is the estimated fully-diluted ownership
percentage of the Kana stockholders in the combined company after the merger)
and (ii) the post-offering cash per fully-diluted Kana share.
The results of
such analysis are set forth below.

As summarized above, the pro forma cash per fully-diluted share of the
combined company in the merger significantly exceeds Kana's cash per fully-
diluted share on a stand-alone basis and under each of the primary offering
scenarios summarized above.

   
(3) Selected Companies Analysis.
Goldman Sachs reviewed and compared certain
financial information, ratios and percentages for Kana and Broadbase with
corresponding financial information, ratios and percentages for the following
publicly traded companies in the software industry: (i) Art Technology Group,
Inc.; (ii) Aspect Communications Corporation; (iii) Blue Martini Software,
Inc.; (iv) BroadVision, Inc.; (v) E.piphany, Inc.; (vi) Intershop
Communications Aktiengesellschaft; (vii) Interwoven, Inc.; (viii) Onyx Software
Corporation; (ix) Pivotal Corporation; (x) Siebel Systems, Inc.; and (xi)
Vignette Corporation.
Goldman Sachs selected the aforementioned companies for
comparison because they are publicly traded companies in the software industry
with operations that for purposes of analysis may be considered similar, in
varying degrees, to the operations of Kana and Broadbase, respectively.

   
The ratios and percentages were calculated using the closing price per share
for Kana, Broadbase and each of the selected companies on April 6, 2001, the
most recent publicly available information, and in certain cases, estimates
provided by Institutional Brokers Estimate System ("IBES") and Wall Street
research.

   
Goldman Sachs' analysis of the selected companies compared the following to
the results for Kana and Broadbase:

  .
April 6, 2001 closing share price as a percentage of the 52-week high
    share price;

  .
equity market value as a multiple of estimated calendar year 2001 and
    2002 revenue;

  .
April 6, 2001 closing share price as a multiple of estimated calendar
    year 2001 and 2002 earnings per share;

  .
estimated five-year compound annual growth rate of earnings per share;
    and

  .
the ratio of the April 6, 2001 closing share price to the estimated
    calendar year 2001 and 2002 earnings per share, as a multiple of the
    estimated five-year compound annual growth rate of earnings per share.

   
The results of such analysis are summarized below.

(4) Selected Transactions Analysis.
For selected recent business combination
transactions involving high-technology companies, Goldman Sachs analyzed (i)
the implied ownership percentage of the combined company of the stockholders of
the acquiror and the target, respectively, (ii) the representation of the
acquiror and the target on the board of directors of the combined company and
(iii) the premium paid based on the closing stock prices of the acquiror and
the target one day prior to announcement of the transaction and the exchange
ratio in such transaction.
The selected transactions were nine business
combination transactions involving high-technology companies announced since
January 1999.
The results of such analysis are summarized below.

In one of the selected transactions, four board members were designated by
    each of acquiror and target (31% each); three additional board members were
    selected by acquiror and target jointly; and two additional board members
    were selected by a stockholder of target.


(6) Two board members will be designated by each of Kana and Broadbase, and one

(7) One-day premium is not applicable for one of the selected transactions
    because the target was a private company prior to the transaction.


(8) Based on closing prices of the Kana common stock and the Broadbase common
    stock on April 6, 2001.

   
In addition, for each of the selected transactions, Goldman Sachs analyzed
the selection of the chairman of the board, chief executive officer and name of
the combined company.
Such analysis indicated that (i) the chairman was
designated by the acquiror in seven of the selected transactions and by the
target in one of the selected transactions (in one of the selected
transactions, the chairman was designated jointly), (ii) the chief executive
officer was designated by the acquiror in six of the selected transactions and
by the target in two of the selected transactions (in one of the selected
transactions, the chief executive officer was an outsider) and (iii) the
combined company retained the name of the acquiror in six of the selected
transactions (the combined company adopted the name of the target, a new name,
and a combination of the names of the acquiror and target, respectively, in the
other selected transactions).

   (5) Contribution Analysis.
Goldman Sachs reviewed certain historical and
estimated future operating and financial information for Kana, Broadbase and
the pro forma combined company, and calculated the respective contributions
each of Kana and Broadbase would have made to the combined company based on
such operating and financial information for purposes of comparison with the
relative equity interests of the stockholders of Kana and Broadbase in the
combined company after the merger.
Goldman Sachs performed such analysis with
respect to revenues and gross profit for 2000 and 2001 and current cash
balance.
The analysis did not take into account any synergies that may result
from the merger.
The results of such analysis are set forth below.

(6) Historical Stock Price Performance Analysis.
Goldman Sachs reviewed the
indexed historical trading prices for the Kana common stock and the Broadbase
common stock for the period from September 21, 1999 (the date of the initial
public offering of shares of common stock of each of Kana and Broadbase) to
April 6, 2001.
In addition, Goldman Sachs compared the price changes in the
Kana common stock and the Broadbase common stock during such period to the
changes in (i) an index of 51 software companies (the Goldman Sachs Software
Index) and (ii) the Nasdaq 500 index.

   
The preparation of a fairness opinion is a complex process and is not
necessarily susceptible to partial analysis or summary description.
Selecting
portions of the analyses or of the summary set forth above, without considering
the analyses as a whole, could create an incomplete view of the processes
underlying Goldman Sachs' opinion.
In arriving at its fairness determination,
Goldman Sachs considered the results of all such analyses.
No company or
transaction used in the above analyses as a comparison is directly comparable
to Kana or Broadbase or the contemplated transaction.

   
The analyses were prepared solely for purposes of Goldman Sachs' providing
its opinion to the Kana board of directors as to the fairness from a financial
point of view to Kana of the exchange ratio in the merger.
These analyses do
not purport to be appraisals or necessarily reflect the prices at which
businesses or securities actually may be sold.
Analyses based upon forecasts of
future results are not necessarily indicative of actual future results, which
may be significantly more or less favorable than suggested by such analyses.

Because such analyses are inherently subject to uncertainty, being based upon
numerous factors or events beyond the control

of the parties or their respective advisors, none of Kana, Broadbase, Goldman
Sachs or any other person assumes responsibility if future results are
materially different from those forecast.

   
As described above, Goldman Sachs' opinion to the board of directors of Kana
was one of many factors taken into consideration by the Kana board of directors
in making its determination to approve the merger agreement.
The foregoing
summary does not purport to be a complete description of the analyses performed
by Goldman Sachs.

   
Goldman Sachs, as part of its investment banking business, is continually
engaged in the valuation of businesses and their securities in connection with
mergers and acquisitions, negotiated underwritings, competitive biddings,
secondary distributions of listed and unlisted securities, private placements
and valuations for estate, corporate and other purposes.
Goldman Sachs is
familiar with Kana, having provided certain investment banking and financial
advisory services to Kana from time to time, including having acted as lead
managing underwriter of Kana's initial public offering of 3,300,000 shares of
Kana common stock in September 1999, as financial advisor to Kana in connection
with its acquisition of Silknet Software, Inc. in April 2000, as agent for Kana
on its private placement of 2,500,000 shares of Kana common stock in June 2000
and as Kana's financial advisor in connection with, and having participated in
certain of the negotiations leading to, the merger agreement.
Goldman Sachs has
also provided certain investment banking services to Broadbase from time to
time, including having acted as lead managing underwriter of its public
offering of 3,450,000 shares of Broadbase common stock in February 2000.
Kana
selected Goldman Sachs as its financial advisor because it is a nationally
recognized investment banking firm that has substantial experience in
transactions similar to the merger.

   
Goldman Sachs provides a full range of financial advisory and securities
services and, in the course of its normal trading activities, may from time to
time effect transactions and hold securities, including derivative securities,
of Kana or Broadbase for its own account and for the accounts of customers.

   
Pursuant to a letter agreement dated March 7, 2001, Kana engaged Goldman
Sachs to act as its financial advisor in connection with a possible merger or
consolidation between Kana and a third party or a possible sale of all or a
portion of Kana to a third party.
Pursuant to the terms of the letter
agreement, Kana has agreed to pay Goldman Sachs a customary fee upon
consummation of the merger.
Kana also has agreed to reimburse Goldman Sachs for
its reasonable out-of-pocket expenses, including attorneys' fees, and to
indemnify Goldman Sachs against certain liabilities, including certain
liabilities under the federal securities laws.


Broadbase's Reasons for the Merger and Recommendation of Broadbase's Board of
Directors

   Broadbase's Reasons for the Merger.
At the meeting of Broadbase's board of
directors on April 8, 2001, the board voted unanimously to enter into the
merger agreement.
The board of directors of Broadbase unanimously concluded
that the merger agreement and merger are advisable, fair to, and in the best
interests of, Broadbase and its stockholders, and recommended that the
stockholders of Broadbase vote to approve and adopt the merger agreement and
approve the merger.
This decision was based upon several potential benefits of
the merger that, when taken as a whole, Broadbase's board believes will
contribute to the success of the combined company compared to Broadbase
continuing to operate as an independent business.
These potential benefits
include:

  .  
the complementary nature of the technologies, products and services of
     Broadbase and Kana and the opportunity to provide an integrated product
     that addresses a much wider range of customer requirements for contact
     center, communications, knowledge management, marketing and analytics
     applications than either company could provide alone, increasing the
     value that can be provided to customers;

  .  
the large customer base of the combined company and the potential for
     significant cross-selling and up-selling opportunities;

  .  
the potential for the merger to enhance the ability of each company to
     achieve profitability sooner than if it had remained independent, as a
     result of a stronger product offering, sales and distribution synergies

   and cross-selling opportunities, the opportunity to leverage the recurring
   maintenance revenues of the combined company and the opportunity to reduce
   overhead and other costs;

  .  
the opportunity to enhance relationships with systems integrators,
     technology partners and other strategic partners and to attract new
     partners;

  .  
the opportunity to increase the competitive position of the combined
     company by offering a broad, integrated product suite to a large
     customer base and by combining the technology, sales and management
     resources of Kana and Broadbase;

   In its evaluation of the merger, the board of Broadbase reviewed several
factors, including:

  .  
historical information and the views of Broadbase's management and
     financial advisers concerning the strengths and weaknesses of Broadbase
     and Kana and the key attributes and opportunities of the combined
     company in terms of, among other things, products, sales, customers,
     management, and financial and competitive position;

  .  
Broadbase's management's view of the financial condition, results of
     operations and businesses of Broadbase and Kana before and after giving
     effect to the merger, including the anticipated impact of the merger and
     the companies' anticipated headcount reductions;

  .  
the percentage ownership of the combined company of Broadbase's
     stockholders;

  .  
the substantial charges and costs to be incurred in connection with the
     merger, including costs of integrating the businesses and transaction
     expenses arising from the merger;

  .  
the prospects of Broadbase, independent of Kana, including risks and
     potential rewards associated with remaining independent in the face of
     industry-wide consolidation;

  .  
the nature of the e-Business software industry in which Broadbase
     operates and the belief of Broadbase's board of directors that greater
     size and resources are increasingly required for companies to
     successfully compete in this industry;

  .  
possible alternative means of achieving the anticipated benefits of the
     merger, including the possibility of a combination with other companies
     and possible strategic alliances that would not involve a combination,
     and internal development of new products and services, as well as the
     feasibility of these alternatives, their potential timing and resource
     requirements;

  .
current financial market conditions and historical market prices,
    volatility and trading information with respect to Broadbase's common
    stock;

  .
the opinion of Morgan Stanley dated April 8, 2001 that, subject to and
    based on the considerations described in its opinion, the exchange ratio
    set forth in the merger agreement was fair from a financial point of view
    to holders of Broadbase common stock, and the related financial analysis;
    and

  .
reports from Broadbase's management and advisors as to the results of
    their due diligence investigations of Kana.

   
Broadbase's board of directors also identified and considered a number of
potentially negative factors in its deliberations concerning the merger,
including the following:

  .
the risk that the potential benefits of the merger, including expected
    synergies and cost savings, may not be realized;

  .
the need to achieve significant cost reductions in order for the combined
    company to realize the potential benefits of the merger and to become
    profitable;

  .
the reduction of Broadbase's cash balances as a result of loans to Kana
    under the revolving loan agreement;

  .  
the uncertain current and prospective market environment for Broadbase's
     and Kana's products and services;

  .
the risk that Broadbase and Kana would not be able to integrate their
    respective products, technology and organizations;

  .
the risk that if the merger is not completed, Broadbase would have made
    loans to Kana, and would have incurred other significant costs and taken
    other actions in contemplation of the merger, and that these actions
    could weaken it as an independent company if the merger were not
    completed;

  .
risks related to Kana's existing relationships with its distribution
    partners and difficulties experienced by Kana in collecting payments from
    certain customers;

  .
the risk that the merger could adversely affect Broadbase's or Kana's
    relationships with current and potential customers, distribution partners
    and other strategic partners;

  .
the potential effect of the distribution and license agreement, the non-
    solicitation covenants, the termination fee and the stock option
    agreement negotiated by Kana in deterring other potential acquirors from
    proposing an alternative transaction that might be more advantageous to
    Broadbase stockholders; and

  .
the other applicable risks described in this joint proxy
    statement/prospectus under the heading "Risk Factors.
"

   In addition, Broadbase's board of directors considered the interests that
its officers and directors may have with respect to the merger in addition to
their interests as Broadbase stockholders.
See "Interests of Broadbase's
Management and Kana's Management in the Merger and Potential Conflicts of
Interest" on page 79 for a more complete discussion of these interests.

   
Broadbase's board of directors concluded that, on balance, the potential
benefits to Broadbase and its stockholders of the merger outweighed the risks
associated with the merger.
The discussion of the information and factors
considered by Broadbase's board of directors is not intended to be exhaustive.

In view of the variety of factors considered in connection with its evaluation
of the merger, Broadbase's board of directors did not find it practicable to,
and did not quantify or otherwise assign relative weight to, the specific
factors considered in reaching its determination.

   
Recommendation of Broadbase's Board of Directors.
After careful
consideration, Broadbase's board of directors has unanimously determined that
the terms of the merger are advisable, fair to, and in the best interests of,
Broadbase and its stockholders and recommends to its stockholders that they
vote in favor of the proposal to approve and adopt the merger agreement and
approve the merger.


Opinion of Broadbase's Financial Advisor

   Under an engagement letter dated April 5, 2001, Broadbase retained Morgan
Stanley to provide it with financial advisory services and a financial fairness
opinion in connection with the merger.
Broadbase's board of directors selected

qualifications, expertise and reputation and its knowledge of the business and
affairs of Broadbase.
At the meeting of the Broadbase board of directors on
April 8, 2001, Morgan Stanley rendered its oral opinion, subsequently confirmed
in writing, that as of April 8, 2001, based upon and subject to the various

Morgan Stanley's opinion is directed to Broadbase's board of directors and
addresses only the fairness from a financial point of view of the exchange
ratio pursuant to the merger agreement to holders of shares of Broadbase common
stock as of the date of the opinion.

the merger and does not constitute a recommendation to any holder of Broadbase
common stock as to how to vote at the Broadbase special meeting to be held in
connection with the merger.

Morgan Stanley assumed and relied upon, without independent verification,
the accuracy and completeness of the information reviewed by it for the
purposes of its opinion.
With respect to the financial projections, including
certain projections and information relating to the strategic, financial and
operational costs and benefits anticipated prior to and resulting from the

Morgan Stanley relied upon the assessment by the management of Broadbase and
Kana of their ability to retain key employees of Broadbase and Kana,
respectively.
Morgan Stanley also relied upon, without independent
verification, the assessment by the management of Broadbase and Kana of: (i)
the strategic,

financial and other costs and benefits expected to result from the merger; (ii)
the timing and risks associated with the integration of Broadbase and Kana; and
(iii) the validity of, and risks associated with, Broadbase's and Kana's
existing and future technologies, services or business models.
Morgan Stanley
did not make any independent valuation or appraisal of the assets or
liabilities or technology of Broadbase and Kana, nor was Morgan Stanley
furnished with any such appraisals.
Morgan Stanley's opinion is necessarily
based on financial, economic, market and other conditions as in effect on, and
the information made available to Morgan Stanley as of, April 8, 2001.

   
In arriving at its opinion, Morgan Stanley was not authorized to solicit,
and did not solicit, interest from any party with respect to an acquisition,
business combination or other extraordinary transaction involving Broadbase.

Morgan Stanley was not asked to consider, and its opinion does not address, the
relative merits of the merger as compared to any alternative strategies or
transactions that might exist for Broadbase or the effect of such strategies or
transactions.

   
The following is a brief summary of the material analyses performed by
Morgan Stanley in connection with its oral opinion and the preparation of its
written opinion letter dated April 8, 2001.
Some of these summaries of
financial analyses include information presented in tabular format.
In order to
fully understand the financial analyses used by Morgan Stanley, the tables must
be read together with the text of each summary.
The tables alone do not
constitute a complete description of the financial analyses.

   
On April 8, 2001, Broadbase and Kana entered into a merger agreement whereby
each holder of Broadbase common stock would receive 1.05 shares of Kana common
stock.
As a result, Broadbase's shareholders would own approximately 48% of the
combined company on a pro forma basis.

   
Exchange Ratio Premium Analysis.
Morgan Stanley reviewed the ratios of the
closing prices of Broadbase common stock divided by the corresponding closing
prices of Kana common stock over various periods ending April 6, 2001.
The
resulting ratios are referred to as average exchange ratios.
Morgan Stanley
examined the premiums represented by the exchange ratio of 1.05x set forth in
the merger agreement, referred to as the transaction exchange ratio, over the
averages of these average exchange ratios, and found them to be as follows:

                                                            Transaction Exchange
                                                                Ratio (1.05x)
                                                Average      Premium to Average
   Ending April 6, 2001                      Exchange Ratio    Exchange Ratio
   --------------------                      --------------

   Last 90 days.............................     
0.852x              23 %
   Last twelve months.......................     0.649x              62 %

Morgan Stanley noted that the transaction exchange ratio was higher than the
exchange ratio as of April 6, 2001 and the average exchange ratio for the
periods ranging from 60 days through 12 months prior to the transaction.

Further, Morgan Stanley noted that the transaction exchange ratio was close to
the high-end of this trading range.

   
Relative Contribution Analysis.
Morgan Stanley compared Broadbase's and
Kana's stockholders' respective pro forma percentage ownership of the combined
company after the merger to Broadbase's and Kana's percentage contribution of
revenues and gross profit to the combined company based on 2000 actual results
and 2001 management estimates of Broadbase and Kana, respectively.

                                                                 --------------

   Calendar Year 2000 Actual....................................   36.5    63.5
   Calendar Year 2001 Estimated.................................   39.9    60.1

   Morgan Stanley noted that based on the exchange ratio of 1.05x set forth in
the merger agreement, holders of shares of Broadbase common stock would own
approximately 48% of the combined company on a pro forma basis.
Morgan Stanley
also noted that the 48% pro forma ownership position of holders of shares of
Broadbase common stock was higher than the percentage contribution to the
combined company by Broadbase of revenues and gross profits for the periods
under consideration.
However, Morgan Stanley also noted that Kana's percentage
contribution to the net loss of the pro forma company was greater than that of
Broadbase.

   
Analysis of Stock Price Premiums Paid in Comparable Transactions.
Morgan
Stanley compared publicly available statistics for comparable mergers of equals
transactions of 14 public transactions between January 1997 to April 8, 2001,
where the target company's ownership of the newly formed entity exceeded 40%.

Morgan Stanley reviewed the premiums to the preceding 1-day, 30-day and 90-day
average exchange ratios prior to announcement for each of these transactions.

   
Based on these analyses, Morgan Stanley applied the following comparable
transactions' exchange ratio premiums to the historical relative trading
performance of Broadbase common stock to Kana common stock:

                                                     Comparable       Implied
                                                   Transactions'     Value Per

   Broadbase

   Premium to 30-day Average Exchange Ratio.....      (1)%- 5%      $0.93-$0.99
   Premium to 90-day Average Exchange Ratio.....       
0 %-10%      $0.75-$0.82

   Based on the exchange ratios paid in comparable transactions analysis,
Morgan Stanley estimated a range of $0.70-$1.00 per share of Broadbase and
noted that the implied transaction value per share (based on the exchange ratio
of 1.05x set forth in the merger agreement) of $0.92 per share was close to the
high end of implied value per share range for comparable transactions.

   
No company or transaction utilized in the analysis of stock price premiums
paid in comparable transactions is identical to Broadbase or Kana or the
merger.
In evaluating the precedent acquisition transactions, Morgan Stanley
made judgments and assumptions with regard to general business, market and
financial conditions and other matters, which are beyond the control of
Broadbase and Kana, such as the impact of competition on the business of
Broadbase, Kana, or the industry generally, industry growth and the absence of
any adverse material change in financial condition of Broadbase, Kana or the
industry or in the financial markets in general, which could affect the public
trading value of the companies and the aggregate value of the transactions to
which they are being compared.

   Comparable Companies Analysis.
Morgan Stanley compared certain financial
information of Broadbase and Kana with publicly available information for
companies that were comparable to Broadbase and Kana.
The

companies analyzed by Morgan Stanley included E.piphany Inc., eGain
Communications Corp., and Primus Knowledge Solutions Inc., (the "eCRM
Companies"), Critical Path Inc., Navisite Inc., Lante Corp., Calico Commerce
Inc., and Concur Technologies Inc. (the "Distressed Companies"), Vignette
Corp., Broadvision Inc., Art Technology Group Inc., and Blue Martini Software
(the "E-Commerce CRM Companies") and Oracle Corp., SAP AG, Siebel Systems Inc.,
BEA Systems Inc., and i2 Technologies Inc., (the "Large Cap CRM Companies"),
together referred to as the comparable companies.

   
For purposes of this analysis, Morgan Stanley analyzed the following
statistics:

  .
the ratio of aggregate value, defined as market capitalization plus total
    debt less cash and cash equivalents to estimated calendar year 2002
    revenues (based on management estimates)

  .
the ratio of market capitalization to cash and cash equivalents (based on
    the latest public information)

   
The following table presents, as of April 6, 2001, the statistics of the
comparable companies Morgan Stanley analyzed.

   In conducting its analysis, Morgan Stanley applied the selected financial
multiples of the comparable companies to the management estimates of various
financial statistics of Broadbase and Kana.
Morgan Stanley then estimated the
implied value per share of Broadbase and Kana as of April 6, 2001.
Morgan
Stanley estimated the following:

                                                                       Implied

0.3x-1.4x   $0.07-$0.30
   Calendar Year 2002E Revenue........................   0.5x-1.0x   $1.15-$2.10

   Based on the comparable companies analysis, Morgan Stanley estimated a range
of prices per share of $0.50-$2.00 for Broadbase and a range of prices per
share of $0.50-$2.00 for Kana.
Morgan Stanley noted that the value of each Kana
share was on the low end of the range for the comparable companies that were
comparable to Kana.

   
No company utilized in the comparable companies analysis is identical to
Broadbase or Kana.
In evaluating the comparable companies, Morgan Stanley made
judgments and assumptions with regard to industry performance, general
business, economic, market and financial conditions and other matters, many of
which are beyond the control of Broadbase and Kana, such as the impact of
competition on the businesses of Broadbase and Kana and the industry generally,
industry growth and the absence of any adverse material change in the financial
condition and prospects of Broadbase and Kana or the industry or in the
financial markets in general.
Mathematical analysis (such as determining the
average or median) is not in itself a meaningful method of using peer group
data.

   
Discounted Equity Value Analysis.
Morgan Stanley performed discounted future
equity value analyses to estimate the present value per share of Broadbase and
Kana.
The projections of financial performance were based on management
estimates.

   Morgan Stanley also performed a pro forma discounted future equity value

Broadbase share after the merger, based on management estimates.

   Morgan Stanley noted that the pro forma implied value per Broadbase share
was higher than the implied value per share of Broadbase, with the premium
ranging from 28% to 114%.
Further, Morgan Stanley also noted that the low end
of the pro forma implied value per Broadbase share was higher than Broadbase's
market price on April 6, 2001 ($0.72 per share).

   
In connection with the review of the merger by Broadbase's board of
directors, Morgan Stanley performed a variety of financial and comparative
analyses for purposes of rendering its opinion.
The preparation of a fairness
opinion is a complex process and is not necessarily susceptible to a partial
analysis or summary description.
In arriving at its opinion, Morgan Stanley
considered the results of all of its analyses as a whole and did not attribute
any particular weight to any analysis or factor it considered.
Morgan Stanley
believes that selecting any portion of its analyses, without considering all
analyses as a whole, would create an incomplete view of the process underlying
its analyses and opinion.
In addition, Morgan Stanley may have given various
analyses and factors more or less weight than other analyses and factors, and
may have deemed various assumptions more or less probable than other
assumptions.
As a result, the ranges of valuations resulting from any
particular analysis described above should not be taken to be Morgan Stanley's
view of the actual value of Broadbase or Kana.
In performing its analyses,
Morgan Stanley made numerous assumptions with respect to industry performance,
general business and economic conditions and other matters.
Many of these
assumptions are beyond the control of Broadbase or Kana.
Any estimates
contained in Morgan Stanley's analyses are not necessarily indicative of future
results or actual values, which may be significantly more or less favorable
than those suggested by such estimates.

   
Morgan Stanley conducted the analyses described above solely as part of its
analysis of the fairness of the exchange ratio pursuant to the merger agreement
from a financial point of view to holders of shares of Broadbase common stock
and in connection with the delivery of its opinion to Broadbase's board of
directors.
These analyses do not purport to be appraisals or to reflect the
prices at which shares of common stock of Broadbase or Kana might actually
trade.

   
The exchange ratio pursuant to the merger agreement was determined through
arm's length negotiations between Broadbase and Kana and was approved by
Broadbase's board of directors.
Morgan Stanley provided advice to Broadbase
during these negotiations.
Morgan Stanley did not however, recommend any
specific exchange ratio to Broadbase or that any specific exchange ratio
constituted the only appropriate exchange ratio for the merger.

   
In addition, Morgan Stanley's opinion and its presentation to Broadbase's
board of directors was one of many factors taken into consideration by
Broadbase's board of directors in deciding to approve the merger.
Consequently,
the analyses as described above should not be viewed as determinative of the
opinion of Broadbase's board of directors with respect to the exchange ratio or
of whether Broadbase's board of directors would have been willing to agree to a
different exchange ratio.

   
Broadbase's board of directors retained Morgan Stanley based upon Morgan
Stanley's qualifications, experience and expertise.
Morgan Stanley is an
internationally recognized investment banking and advisory firm.
Morgan
Stanley, as part of its investment banking and financial advisory business, is
continuously engaged in the valuation of businesses and securities in
connection with mergers and acquisitions, negotiated underwritings, competitive
biddings, secondary distributions of listed and unlisted securities, private
placements and valuations for corporate, estate and other purposes.
In the
past, Morgan Stanley has provided financial advisory services for Broadbase and
has received fees for rendering these services.
In the ordinary course of
business, Morgan Stanley or its affiliates may from time to time trade in the
securities or indebtedness of Broadbase or Kana for its own account, the
accounts of investment funds and other clients under the management of Morgan
Stanley and for the account of customers and, accordingly, may hold long or
short positions in these securities or indebtedness.

   
Under the engagement letter, Morgan Stanley provided financial advisory
services in connection with the merger, and Broadbase agreed to pay Morgan
Stanley a fee for providing financial advisory services in connection with the
merger.
Broadbase has also agreed to reimburse Morgan Stanley for its expenses
incurred in performing its services.
In addition, Broadbase has agreed to
indemnify Morgan Stanley and its affiliates, their respective directors,
officers, agents and employees and each person, if any, controlling Morgan
Stanley or any of its affiliates against certain liabilities and expenses,
including certain liabilities under the federal securities laws, related to or
arising out of Morgan Stanley's engagement.


Interests of Broadbase's Management and Kana's Management in the Merger and
Potential Conflicts of Interest

   It is anticipated that the directors and officers of Broadbase and their
affiliates will beneficially own approximately 5.7% of the outstanding shares
of Kana common stock after the merger.
Under the rules of the Securities and
Exchange Commission, the following are deemed to be beneficially owned and
outstanding for purposes of calculating the number of shares and the percentage
beneficially owned by a person or entity:

  .
shares of common stock issuable upon the exercise of options which may be
    exercised within 60 days after April 9, 2001, or currently exercisable
    options; and

  .
shares of common stock issuable upon the exercise of warrants which may
    be exercised within 60 days after April 9, 2001, or currently exercisable
    warrants.

   
However, these shares are not deemed to be beneficially owned or outstanding
for purposes of computing the percentage beneficially owned by any other person
or entity.

   
Robert Davoli and Kevin Harvey, each non-employee members of Broadbase's
board of directors, hold options to purchase 20,000 and 40,000 shares of
Broadbase common stock, respectively.
These options are fully vested and
immediately exercisable.
In addition, Mr. Davoli owns 36,010 shares of
Broadbase common stock issued pursuant to a restricted stock purchase agreement
under which Broadbase may repurchase any shares that have not vested.
According
to the terms of Mr. Davoli's restricted stock purchase agreement, Broadbase's
right of repurchase will lapse as to all of Mr. Davoli's shares upon the
closing of the merger.

   
One employee member of Broadbase's board of directors, Massood Zarrabian, is
entitled to certain benefits if he is terminated without cause or
constructively terminated prior to December 19, 2002.
Currently, he holds an
option to purchase 619,372 shares of Broadbase common stock that will become
fully exercisable as to all of the remaining, unvested portion upon the
occurrence of either such event.
Mr. Zarrabian also holds options to purchase
an additional 259,272 shares of Broadbase common stock that will become fully
exercisable as to 50% of the remaining, unvested portion upon the occurrence of
either such event.
Finally, upon the occurrence of either such event, Mr.
Zarrabian is also entitled to one year of salary, plus bonuses, payable in a
lump sum.
The merger of Kana and Broadbase is not expected to constitute a
constructive termination with respect to Mr. Zarrabian.

   
In addition, certain executive officers of Broadbase, including Chuck Bay,
Thomas Doyle, Brian Kelly, David Milam, and Eric Willgohs, have employment
agreements under which they will be entitled to 50% accelerated vesting as to
their outstanding, unvested options, including the Broadbase options assumed by
Kana in the merger, in the event that, following the merger, they are not
offered employment by the combined company in a comparable position and at a
comparable salary.

   
On April 26, 2001, James Wood, Kana's chief executive officer, who is
expected to be chairman of the combined company's board of directors following
the merger, and Nigel Donovan, Kana's chief operating officer, who is expected
to become a vice president of the combined company following the merger,
received options to purchase Kana common stock.
Mr. Wood received an option to
purchase 400,000 shares of Kana common stock that will vest in equal monthly
increments from the grant date over the next 48 months of his continued service
to Kana, and Mr. Donovan received an option to purchase 500,000 shares of Kana
common stock that will vest in equal monthly increments from the grant date
over the next 24 months of his continued service to Kana.
Both options have an
exercise price of $1.24 per share.

   
For certain employees of Broadbase the acceleration of the vesting of
options upon the closing of the merger or the subsequent termination of
employment may, together with any severance payment, result in "excess
parachute payments" as defined in Section 280G of the Internal Revenue Code.

Excess parachute payments are not deductible in accordance with Section 280G.
As a result, Kana will not be entitled to a tax deduction for the amount
determined to be excess parachute payments.

   
Kana and Broadbase have agreed that upon completion of the merger, Chuck Bay
and Massood Zarrabian, each of whom are currently Broadbase directors, will be
appointed to the board of directors of the combined company.
In addition,
Kana's board of directors has nominated Kevin Harvey for election to a three
year term on the board of directors of the combined company beginning in 2001.

   
Kana and Broadbase have agreed that following the merger, Chuck Bay,
president and chief executive officer of Broadbase, will become the president
and chief executive officer of the combined company.

   
Kana has agreed to indemnify present and former officers and directors of
Broadbase against costs or expenses, judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages
or liabilities arising out of or pertaining to matters relating to their
service as such an officer or director, including the transactions contemplated
by the merger agreement, to the fullest extent that Broadbase would have been
permitted.
The merger agreement provides that all rights to indemnification for
present and former officers and directors of Broadbase survive the merger for
at least six years.
Kana has also agreed to maintain insurance for Broadbase's
directors and officers equivalent to Broadbase's current directors' and
officers' liability insurance for at least six years after the merger, subject
to limitations.

   
David Beirne, one of Kana's directors, and Kevin Harvey, one of Broadbase's
directors, are both managing members of Benchmark Capital Management Co., LLC,
which is the general partner of several Benchmark funds that collectively hold
a significant number of shares of common stock of both companies.
Entities
affiliated with Benchmark Capital Management Co., LLC beneficially owned
6,927,511 shares of Kana common stock, or 8.3% of its common stock as of
February 28, 2001.
Entities affiliated with Benchmark Capital Management Co.,
LLC beneficially owned 4,091,832 shares of Broadbase common stock, or
approximately 5.0% of its common stock as of March 1, 2001.

   
As a result of the foregoing, the directors and officers of Broadbase may be
more likely to approve the merger than Broadbase stockholders generally.


The Merger

   Arrow Acquisition Corp., a Delaware corporation and a wholly-owned
subsidiary of Kana, will merge with and into Broadbase following:

  .
the approval and adoption of the merger agreement and the approval of the
    merger by the Broadbase stockholders;

  .
the approval of the issuance of Kana common stock in the merger and
    approval of the Kana name change by the Kana stockholders;

  .
the election or appointment of Chuck Bay, Kevin Harvey and Massood
    Zarrabian to the board of directors of the combined company; and

  .
the satisfaction or waiver of the other conditions to the merger.
See the
    "The Merger Agreement--Conditions to Closing the Merger.
"

   Broadbase will be the surviving corporation and will become a wholly-owned
subsidiary of Kana upon completion of the merger.


Closing of the Merger

   The merger will become effective when Kana and Broadbase file a certificate
of merger with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware.
Kana and
Broadbase are working toward completing the merger as soon as possible and hope
to complete the merger in June 2001.
Because the merger is subject to a number
of conditions, however, we cannot predict the exact timing.


Conversion of Broadbase Shares in the Merger

   At the effective time of the merger, each outstanding share of Broadbase
common stock will automatically be converted into the right to receive 1.05
shares of Kana common stock.
The number of shares of Kana common stock issuable
in the merger will be proportionately adjusted as appropriate for any stock
split, stock dividend or similar event with respect to Broadbase common stock
or Kana common stock effected between the date of the merger agreement and the
completion of the merger.


Broadbase Stock Options and Warrants

   Immediately prior to the effective time of the merger, each option to
purchase shares of Broadbase common stock under the Broadbase 1999 Equity Plan,
the Broadbase 2000 Stock Incentive Plan, the Broadbase 1996 Equity Incentive
Plan and the Broadbase 1999 Employee Stock Purchase Plan together with all
other options to purchase Broadbase common stock and warrants outstanding as of
the effective time will be assumed by Kana, regardless of whether the options
and warrants are then exercisable, and will be converted into options and
warrants, as the case may be, to purchase Kana common stock.
Each assumed
Broadbase stock option and warrant will have the same terms and conditions as
the option or warrant immediately prior to the effective time, and will
constitute an option or warrant to acquire that number of shares of Kana common
stock equal to the number of shares of Broadbase common stock purchasable under
such option or warrant multiplied by 1.05 (rounded down to the nearest whole
number), at a price per share equal to the aggregate exercise price for the
shares of Broadbase common stock purchasable under such Broadbase stock option
or warrant immediately prior to the effective time divided by the number of
full shares of Kana common stock deemed purchasable under such Broadbase stock
option or warrant in accordance with this description (rounded up to the
nearest whole cent).

   
The parties intend for the Broadbase stock options assumed by Kana to
qualify as incentive stock options to the extent the stock options qualified as
incentive stock options prior to the effective time of the merger.


The Exchange Agent

   As of the effective time of the merger, Kana is required to deposit with a
bank or trust company certificates representing the shares of Kana common stock
to be exchanged for shares of Broadbase common stock and cash to pay for
fractional shares and any dividends or distributions that holders of Broadbase
common stock may be entitled to receive under the merger agreement.


Exchange of Broadbase Stock Certificates for Kana Stock Certificates

   Promptly after the effective time, the exchange agent will mail to Broadbase
stockholders a letter of transmittal and instructions for surrendering their
Broadbase stock certificates in exchange for Kana stock certificates.
Broadbase
stockholders should not submit their stock certificates for exchange until they
have received the letter of transmittal and instructions.


Transfer of Ownership; Distributions with Respect to Unexchanged Shares

   Kana will issue a Kana stock certificate in the name registered for the
surrendered Broadbase stock certificate.
Kana will issue a stock certificate in
a name other than this only if the exchange agent is provided with documents
that:

  .
show and effect the unrecorded transfer of ownership; and

  .
show that any applicable stock transfer taxes have been paid.

   
Broadbase stockholders are not entitled to receive any dividends or other
distributions on Kana common stock with a record date after the merger is
completed until they have surrendered their Broadbase stock certificates in
exchange for Kana stock certificates.


Material Federal Income Tax Considerations

   Federal Income Tax Consequences to Broadbase Stockholders.
The following
discussion summarizes the material United States federal income tax
consequences of the merger.
This discussion is based on the Internal Revenue
Code, the related Treasury regulations promulgated thereunder, existing
administrative interpretations and court decisions, all of which are subject to
change, possibly with retroactive effect.
This discussion assumes that
Broadbase stockholders hold their shares of Broadbase stock as capital assets
within the meaning of section 1221 of the Internal Revenue Code.
This
discussion does not address all aspects of United States federal income
taxation that may be important to you in light of your particular circumstances
or if you are subject to special rules.
These special rules include rules
relating to:

  .
stockholders who are not citizens or residents of the United States;

  .
financial institutions;

  .
tax-exempt organizations;

  .
insurance companies;

  .
dealers in securities;

  .
stockholders who acquired their shares of Broadbase common stock through
    the exercise of options or similar derivative securities or otherwise as
    compensation; or

  .
stockholders who hold their shares of Broadbase common stock as part of a
    straddle, conversion or other integrated transaction.

   
The obligations of Kana and Broadbase to complete the merger are conditioned
on the delivery of an opinion to Kana from Brobeck, Phleger & Harrison LLP, and
to Broadbase from Fenwick & West LLP, to the effect that the merger will
qualify as a reorganization within the meaning of section 368(a) of the
Internal Revenue Code and that each of Kana and Broadbase will be a party to
the reorganization within the meaning of section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue
Code.

   
Kana and Broadbase believe, based on the advice of their respective counsel,
that the merger will have the United States federal income tax consequences
discussed below.
The opinions of counsel referred to above will assume the
absence of changes in existing facts and will rely on assumptions,
representations and covenants including those contained in certificates
executed by officers of Kana and Broadbase.
The opinions referred to above
neither bind the IRS nor preclude the IRS from adopting a position contrary to
that expressed in the opinions, and no assurance can be given that contrary
positions will not be successfully asserted by the IRS or adopted by a court if
the positions were litigated.
Neither company intends to obtain a ruling from
the IRS with respect to the tax consequences of the merger.

   
Assuming the merger does qualify as a reorganization, the merger will have
the following federal income tax consequences to the Broadbase stockholders,
subject to the limitations and qualifications referred to herein:

  .
You will not recognize gain or loss on the exchange of your Broadbase
    shares for shares of Kana common stock in the merger, except as discussed
    below with respect to cash received in lieu of fractional shares of Kana
    common stock.

  .
If you receive cash in lieu of a fractional share of Kana common stock,
    you will be treated as if you actually received such fractional share,
    and such share was subsequently redeemed by Kana.
You will recognize gain
    or loss with respect to the cash you receive in lieu of a fractional
    share measured by the difference between the amount of cash you receive
    and your tax basis in the fractional share.
Your gain or loss will be
    capital gain or loss and will be long-term capital gain or loss if you
    have held your Broadbase stock for more than one year as of the closing
    date of the merger.

  .
You must transfer the tax basis in your Broadbase shares to the Kana
    common stock (including fractional shares) you receive in the merger.
    
After any fractional shares are treated as redeemed, the

   aggregate tax basis in the Kana common stock you receive in the merger
   will equal the aggregate tax basis in the Broadbase shares you
   surrendered, reduced by any basis allocable to fractional shares in
   exchange for which you receive cash.

  .
The holding period for the Kana common stock you receive in the merger
    will include the period during which you held the Broadbase shares you
    exchanged for Kana common stock.

   
Even if the merger qualifies as a reorganization, you will recognize gain to
the extent that you receive any shares of Kana common stock in exchange for
services or property other than solely Broadbase shares.
All or a portion of
such gain could be taxable as ordinary income.
You will also recognize gain to
the extent you are treated as receiving consideration other than Kana common
stock in exchange for Broadbase shares.

   
Federal Income Tax Consequences to Kana and Broadbase.
Kana, including the
merger subsidiary, and Broadbase will not recognize gain or loss as a result of
the merger.


Accounting Treatment

   Kana intends to account for the merger as a purchase for accounting and
financial reporting purposes, which means that Broadbase will be treated as a
separate entity for periods prior to the closing, and thereafter as a wholly-
owned subsidiary of Kana.
In addition, Kana may record on its balance sheet
goodwill or negative goodwill depending on the fair value of the assets
acquired and liabilities assumed in the merger.
This amount is expected to be
amortized over a three-year period following the merger.


Stockholders' Dissenters' Rights

   Under Delaware law, neither Kana nor Broadbase stockholders are entitled to
dissenter's rights of appraisal in connection with the merger.


Listing of Kana Common Stock to be Issued in the Merger

   The approval for quotation on the Nasdaq National Market of the shares of
Kana common stock to be issued in the merger is a condition to the consummation
of the merger.


Restrictions on Sale of Shares by Affiliates of Kana and Broadbase

   The shares of Kana common stock to be issued in connection with the merger
will be registered under the Securities Act and will be freely transferable
under the Securities Act, except for shares of Kana common stock issued to any
person who is deemed to be an affiliate of either Kana or Broadbase at the time
of the stockholder meetings.
Persons who may be deemed to be affiliates include
individuals or entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common
control with either Kana or Broadbase and may include some of the officers,
directors, or principal stockholders of Kana or Broadbase.
Affiliates of
Broadbase and Kana may not sell their shares of Kana common stock acquired in
connection with the merger except pursuant to:

  .
an effective registration statement under the Securities Act covering the
    resale of those shares; or

  .
an exemption under the Securities Act including, in the case of
    affiliates of Broadbase, Rule 145.

   
Kana's registration statement on Form S-4, of which this joint proxy
statement/prospectus forms a part, does not cover the resale of shares of Kana
common stock to be received by affiliates of Broadbase and Kana in the merger.


Management Following the Merger

   Kana and Broadbase have agreed that following the merger, Chuck Bay,
president and chief executive officer of Broadbase, will become the president
and chief executive officer of the combined company.
James Wood, Kana's chief
executive officer, will serve as chairman of the board of directors of the
combined company.


Operations Following the Merger

   Following the merger, Broadbase will operate as a wholly-owned subsidiary of
Kana.
Upon consummation of the merger, it is anticipated that the members of
Broadbase's board will be James Wood and Chuck Bay.
The stockholders of
Broadbase will become stockholders of Kana, and their rights as stockholders
will be governed by Kana's certificate of incorporation, Kana's bylaws and the
laws of the State of Delaware.
After the merger, Kana's board will consist of
two directors designated by Kana, initially expected to be Robert Frick and
James Wood, two directors designated by Broadbase, initially expected to be
Kevin Harvey and Chuck Bay, and one director to be mutually agreed to by Kana
and Broadbase, initially expected to be Massood Zarrabian.

                              
THE MERGER AGREEMENT

   This section describes the merger agreement.
While we believe that this
description covers the material terms of the merger agreement, this summary may
not contain all of the information that is important to you.
The merger
agreement is attached to this joint proxy statement/prospectus as Appendix I,
and we urge you to carefully read this document in its entirety.


Representations and Warranties

   Broadbase and Kana each made substantially similar representations and
warranties in the merger agreement regarding aspects of its respective
businesses, financial condition, structure and other facts pertinent to the
merger.
Each company made representations and warranties with respect to both
it and, in many cases, its subsidiaries, including the merger subsidiary in the
case of Kana, relating to the following:

  .

     business;

agreement entitled "Representations and Warranties of Company," and
"Representations and Warranties of Parent and Merger Sub" carefully.


Conduct of Each Company's Business Before the Closing of the Merger

   Broadbase and Kana have each agreed that until the earlier of the closing of
the merger and the termination of the merger agreement, or unless the other
consents in writing, each of them and their subsidiaries will carry on their
respective business in the usual, regular and ordinary course, pay its debts
and taxes when due and perform its other material obligations.
Each has also
agreed to use all reasonable efforts to preserve its relationships with
customers, suppliers, licensors, licensees, and others with which it has
business dealings.
Each has also agreed to notify the other of any material
event involving its business.

   
Broadbase and Kana have also each agreed that until the earlier of the
closing of the merger and the termination of the merger agreement, or unless
the other company consents in writing (which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld or delayed) and as contemplated by the merger agreement, it and each
of its subsidiaries will conduct its business in compliance with specific
restrictions relating to the following:

  .

     the period of exercisability of options or restricted stock, or

     available under its authorized stock option pool (net of cancellations)
     with respect to newly hired employees or promotions of existing
     employees, or as a part of its annual option grant program, or as a
     retention grant, in each case in the ordinary course of business,
     consistent with past practice, or issuances of its common stock upon
     exercise of outstanding options on the date of the merger agreement, or

     its 401(k) plan;

     materially adversely affect it;

  .

  .  
changing accounting practices or materially revaluing assets (except as
     required by generally accepted accounting principles).

   
Each party has also agreed to use all reasonable efforts to implement and
complete the restructuring plan adopted by its respective board of directors.

The agreements related to the conduct of each company's business in the merger
agreement are complicated and not easily summarized.
We urge you to read the
section of the merger agreement entitled "Conduct Prior to the Effective Time"
carefully.

   
On or about April 12, 2001, Kana agreed to allow Broadbase to reprice all of
its outstanding options and in connection with this repricing, to increase the
size of its option reserve.
In addition, Kana was informed that Broadbase wrote
down approximately $958.2 million in goodwill.
Concurrently, Broadbase agreed
to allow Kana to pay excess severance to terminated employees, to allow other
associated severance arrangements, to grant additional options to continuing
employees and to allow Kana to issue warrants to a Kana customer.


Broadbase Stock Option Exchange Program

   On April 27, 2001, Broadbase commenced a stock option exchange program and
filed a tender offer statement on Schedule TO with the Securities and Exchange
Commission.
Under this exchange program, Broadbase option holders have the
opportunity to exchange existing options with an exercise price per share of
more than $0.92 for new options to purchase the same number of shares covered
by the existing options.
The per share exercise price of the new options will
be $0.92, which was the closing price of Broadbase's common stock as reported
by the Nasdaq National Market on April 11, 2001, the date on which the
Broadbase board approved this program.

   
To be eligible to participate in the exchange program, an option holder must
have been an employee, officer, director, consultant, independent contractor or
advisor of Broadbase or its subsidiaries as of April 11, 2001.
The Broadbase
board expects to grant the new options under Broadbase's 1999 Equity Incentive
Plan or its 2000 Stock Incentive Plan.
Some of the key features of the new
options are:

  .
the new options will vest and become exercisable in 48 equal monthly
    increments beginning on April 11, 2001, except that if the new option
    replaces any existing option that is entirely unvested as of the grant
    date, the new option will begin to vest on April 11, 2001, but will not
    be exercisable until the first date that the corresponding existing
    option would have become exercisable (at which time, the new option will
    be exercisable as to any shares that vested monthly between April 11,
    2001 and the first date of exercisability);

  .
if the existing option was fully vested upon grant, such as those granted
    annually to non-employee directors, the new options will also be fully
    vested upon grant;

  .
if the existing option has a provision for acceleration of some or all of
    the vesting of the shares upon a change in control of Broadbase or upon
    termination of employment, the new option will have the same provision
    for acceleration;

  .
the new option will expire ten years after the grant date, subject to
    earlier termination upon termination of employment;

  .
the new option will be a non-statutory stock option; and

  .
the other terms and conditions of the new option will be substantially
    similar to those of the cancelled options.

   
Broadbase plans to hold the exchange period open for its option holders
until 9:00 p.m. Pacific Daylight Time on May 24, 2001, unless it extends this
period.
Broadbase will grant the new options promptly after this exchange
period expires.

   
As of April 26, 2001, there were options outstanding to purchase
approximately 24.6 million shares of Broadbase common stock.
Of these, options
to purchase approximately 19.6 million shares of Broadbase common stock had an
exercise price greater than $0.92.
As of April 26, 2001, Broadbase's executive
officers and directors as a group (12 persons) held options to purchase
approximately 5,882,937 shares of Broadbase common stock, representing
approximately 30% of the shares subject to options that are eligible for
exchange, as follows: Chuck Bay - 2,300,500 shares; Massood Zarrabian - 619,372
shares; Chris Maeda - 583,624 shares; David Milam - 575,500 shares; Brian Kelly
- - 450,500 shares; Fabio Angelillis - 450,000 shares; Thomas Doyle - 400,500
shares; Greg Martin - 325,500 shares; Eric Willgohs - 117,441 shares; Kevin
Harvey - 40,000 shares and Robert Davoli - 20,000 shares.


No Other Negotiations

   Until the merger is completed or the merger agreement is terminated,
Broadbase and Kana have each agreed not to take any of the following actions
directly or indirectly:

  .  
solicit, initiate, knowingly encourage or knowingly induce the making,
     submission or announcement of any Acquisition Proposal, as that term is
     defined below on page 89;

  .  
participate in any discussions or negotiations regarding any Acquisition
     Proposal except for discussions to elicit information to determine
     whether the Acquisition Proposal constitutes a Superior Offer as that
     term is defined below on page 89;

  .  
furnish any non-public information with respect to any Acquisition
     Proposal;

  .  
take any other action to facilitate any inquiries or the making of any
     Acquisition Proposal except to elicit information to determine whether
     the Acquisition Proposal constitutes a Superior Offer;

  .  
participate in discussions with any person with respect to any
     Acquisition Proposal;

  .  
approve, endorse or recommend any Acquisition Proposal; or

  .  
enter into any letter of intent or similar document or any contract,
     agreement or commitment relating to any Acquisition Proposal.

   
However, if either Kana or Broadbase receives an unsolicited, written
Acquisition Proposal prior to the approval of the merger at its stockholders'
meeting that its board concludes in good faith, after consultation with its
financial advisor, may constitute a Superior Offer, as defined below, it may
furnish non-public information regarding it and may enter into discussions with
the person or group who has made that Acquisition Proposal, if:

  .  
neither it nor its representatives shall have violated the non-
     solicitation provisions of the merger agreement or the provisions of the
     merger agreement relating to holding its stockholders meeting;

  .  
its board of directors concludes in good faith, after consultation with
     outside legal counsel, that it would be inconsistent with its fiduciary
     obligations to its stockholders under applicable law to fail to take
     this action;

  .  
prior to furnishing non-public information to, or entering into any
     discussions or negotiations with, a party making the Acquisition
     Proposal except discussions to elicit information to determine whether
     the

   Acquisition Proposal constitutes a Superior Offer, it gives the other
   company written notice of the Acquisition Proposal, including the identity
   of the party making the Acquisition Proposal and the material terms and
   conditions of the Acquisition Proposal; and

  .  
it furnishes the non-public information to the other company (to the
     extent that such information has not been previously provided) at the
     same time that it furnishes this information to the party making the
     Acquisition Proposal and the information furnished to the other party is
     subject to an agreement requiring the confidential treatment of that
     information.

   
An Acquisition Proposal is any offer or proposal by a third party to either
Kana or Broadbase relating to:

  .  
the acquisition or purchase of more than a 30% interest in the total
     outstanding voting securities of it or any of its subsidiaries;

  .  
any tender offer or exchange offer, that, if consummated, would result
     in any person or group beneficially owning 30% or more of the total
     outstanding voting securities of it or any of its subsidiaries;

  .  
any merger, consolidation, business combination or similar transaction
     involving it under which its stockholders immediately prior to the
     acquisition hold less than 60% of the equity interest in the resulting
     entity; or

  .  
any sale, lease, other than in the ordinary course of business,
     exchange, transfer, license other than in the ordinary course of
     business, acquisition, or disposition of more than 50% of its assets.

   
A Superior Offer with respect to either Kana or Broadbase is:

  .  
an unsolicited, bona fide Acquisition Proposal made by a third party
     that its board determines in good faith, after consultation with its
     financial advisor, to be substantially more favorable to its
     stockholders than the merger; and

  .  which, by its terms, requires that this merger and the merger agreement
     be terminated as a condition to the completion of the proposed
     Acquisition Proposal.


An offer will not be a Superior Offer if any financing required to complete
the proposed transaction is not committed and it is not likely in the good
faith determination of the board of directors, after consultation with its
financial advisor, to be obtained by the third party on a timely basis.

   
The board of either Broadbase or Kana may, without breaching the merger
agreement, withhold, withdraw, amend or modify its recommendation in favor of
the merger proposal or endorse or recommend a Superior Offer if:

  .  
a Superior Offer is made to the other company and is not withdrawn;

  .  
it provides written notice of the Superior Offer to the other company,
     including the identity of the party making the Superior Offer and
     summarizing the material terms and conditions of the Superior Offer;

  .  
the other company does not, within two business days after receiving a
     written notice from the company receiving the Superior Offer, make an
     offer that the board of the company receiving the Superior Offer
     determines by majority vote in its good faith judgment, after
     consultation with its financial advisor, to be at least as favorable to
     its stockholders as the Superior Offer;

  .  
its board concludes in good faith, after consultation with its outside
     legal counsel, that its failure to withhold, withdraw, amend or modify
     its recommendation in light of the Superior Offer would be inconsistent
     with its fiduciary obligations to its stockholders under applicable law;
     and

  .  
it has not knowingly violated the non-solicitation provisions of the
     merger agreement or the provisions of the merger agreement relating to
     holding its stockholders meeting.

   
Each company has also agreed to provide the other with at least two days
prior notice (or such lesser prior notice as provided to its own board) of any
meeting of its board at which its board is reasonably expected to consider any
Acquisition Proposal to determine whether it is a Superior Offer.
Even if an
Acquisition Proposal or a Superior Offer is made or the board's recommendation
with respect to the merger proposal is withheld, withdrawn, amended or
modified, it must nevertheless hold and convene its stockholders' meeting as
promptly as possible and within 45 days of the effectiveness of Kana's
registration statement and put the merger proposal to a vote of its
stockholders.


Public Disclosure

   Kana and Broadbase have each agreed to consult with the other and, to the
extent practicable, agree before issuing any press release or making any public
statement with respect to the merger or the merger agreement.


Employee Benefit Plans

   Kana and Broadbase will work together in good faith to agree upon mutually
acceptable employee benefit and compensation arrangements.

     authorized for quotation on the Nasdaq National Market, subject to

Broadbase's obligations to complete the merger are subject to satisfaction
or waiver of each of the following additional conditions:

  .

     or where the failure to be true and correct would not, in the aggregate,

  .  
Kana shall have taken all action necessary to appoint or elect to Kana's
     board of directors upon the effective time of the merger the individuals
     agreed upon by the parties to the merger agreement.

   
Kana's obligations to complete the merger are subject to satisfaction or
waiver of each of the following additional conditions:

  .  
the representations and warranties of Broadbase must be true and
     correct, except as result of transactions contemplated by the merger
     agreement or where the failure to be true and correct would not, in the
     aggregate, have a material adverse effect;

  .

     all of its agreements and covenants required by the merger agreement to
     be performed or complied with by it at or before closing the merger;

     since April 9, 2001, and be continuing; and

  .

     suppliers, distributors, partners and employees of the entity;

  .  
the effect of performing the obligations under the merger agreement or
     loan agreement or in connection with the restructuring plan approved by
     the entity's board; and

  .  
changes principally caused by one party's refusal to consent to an
     action reasonably requested by the other party after the latter party's
     board determines in good faith and certifies to the first party that the
     action is necessary to avoid a material adverse effect.


Termination of the Merger Agreement

   The merger agreement may be terminated at any time prior to closing the
merger, whether before or after the requisite stockholder approval, by either
Kana or Broadbase:

  .  
by mutual written consent duly authorized by the boards of Kana and
     Broadbase;

  .  
if the merger is not completed by October 31, 2001 (or December 31,
     2001, in the event that the applicable waiting period under the Hart-
     Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976 has not expired and the
     extending party reasonably believes it will expire in time to permit the
     closing to occur by such date), except that the right to terminate the
     merger agreement under this provision is not available to any party
     whose action or failure to act has been a principal cause resulting in
     the failure of the merger to occur on or by October 31, 2001, and this
     action or failure to act constitutes a material breach of the merger
     agreement;

  .  
if a governmental authority has issued an order, decree or ruling or
     taken any other action that is final and non-appealable, having the
     effect of permanently enjoining, restraining or prohibiting the merger;

  .  
if the merger agreement is not approved and adopted and the merger is
     not approved by the stockholders of Broadbase, except that the right to
     terminate the merger agreement under this provision is not available to
     Broadbase where the failure to obtain stockholder approval was caused by
     an action or failure to act by Broadbase that constitutes a material
     breach of the merger agreement;

  .  
if the approval of the issuance of shares of Kana common stock in the
     merger and the amendment to Kana's certificate of incorporation
     effecting the change of Kana's name shall not have been approved by
     Kana's stockholders, except that the right to terminate the merger
     agreement under this provision is not available to Kana if the failure
     to obtain stockholder approval was caused by an action or failure to act
     by Kana that constitutes a material breach of the merger agreement;

  .  
at any time prior to the other party receiving the required approval of
     its stockholders, if a Triggering Event, as described below, occurs;

  .  
upon a breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement on
     the part of the other party in the merger agreement, or if any of the
     other party's representations or warranties are or become materially
     untrue, so that the corresponding condition to closing the merger would
     not be met.
However, if the breach or inaccuracy is curable by the
     breaching party through the exercise of its commercially reasonable
     efforts, and the breaching party continues to exercise commercially
     reasonable efforts, then the nonbreaching party may not terminate the
     merger agreement if the breach or inaccuracy is cured within 45 days
     after delivery of the notice of breach or inaccuracy or the nonbreaching
     party is in material breach of the merger agreement; or

  .  
if the other party willfully and materially breaches its obligations
     under the loan agreement and this breach continues for two business days
     after receiving written notice of the breach.

   
A Triggering Event will occur if:

  .  
the board of directors or any board committee of Kana or Broadbase
     withdraws, amends or modifies, in a manner adverse to the other party,
     its recommendation in favor of the adoption and approval of the merger
     agreement and the approval of the merger, or in the case of Kana, in
     favor of the issuance of Kana common stock in the merger or the
     amendment of its certificate of incorporation relating to its name
     change;

  .  
Broadbase or Kana fails to include in this joint proxy
     statement/prospectus the recommendation of its board of directors in
     favor of the adoption and approval of the merger agreement and the
     approval of the merger, or in the case of Kana, in favor of the issuance
     of Kana common stock in the merger or the amendment of its certificate
     of incorporation relating to its name change;

  .  
the board of directors or any board committee of Kana or Broadbase fails
     to reaffirm its recommendation in favor of adoption and approval of the
     merger agreement and the approval of the merger, or in the case of Kana,
     in favor of the issuance of Kana common stock in the merger or the
     amendment of its certificate of incorporation relating to its name
     change, within 10 days after the other party requests in writing that
     this recommendation be reaffirmed following the public announcement of
     an Acquisition Proposal;

  .  
the board of directors of Broadbase or Kana approves or publicly
     recommends any Acquisition Proposal;

  .  
Broadbase or Kana enters into a letter of intent or similar document or
     agreement accepting an Acquisition Proposal;

  .  
Broadbase or Kana knowingly breaches the non-solicitation provisions of
     the merger agreement or the provisions of the merger agreement relating
     to holding its stockholders meeting; or

  .  
if a tender or exchange offer relating to the securities of a party is
     commenced by a person or entity unaffiliated with the other party, and
     the party does not send to its stockholders within 10 business days
     after the tender or exchange offer is first commenced, a statement
     disclosing that the party recommends rejection of the tender or exchange
     offer.


Termination Fee

   Subject to the conditions below, if either Broadbase or Kana terminates the
merger agreement because the merger is not completed by October 31, 2001, (or
December 31, 2001, if extended), then the terminating party is obligated to pay
to the other within two days of the termination a termination fee equal to $2.5
million in immediately available funds.

   
Subject to the conditions below, Broadbase shall pay Kana a termination fee
equal to $2.5 million if the merger agreement is terminated by Kana or
Broadbase because of the failure of Broadbase's stockholders to approve the
merger and the merger agreement or if the merger agreement is terminated by
Kana because of a Triggering Event related to Broadbase.

   
Subject to the conditions below, Kana shall pay Broadbase a termination fee
equal to $2.5 million if the merger agreement is terminated by Kana or
Broadbase because of the failure of Kana's stockholders to approve the issuance
of Kana common stock in the merger or the amendment of Kana's certificate of
incorporation relating to its name change or if the merger agreement is
terminated by Broadbase because of a Triggering Event related to Kana.

   
However, if Broadbase or Kana terminates the merger agreement because the
merger is not completed by October 31, 2001, (or December 31, 2001, if the
deadline for closing is extended) or because the required stockholder approvals
of that party have not been received, the $2.5 million termination fee must be
paid only if:

  .  
a Triggering Event related to that party has not occurred;

  .  
prior to termination of the merger agreement an Acquisition Proposal is
     publicly announced concerning that party and another person; and

  .  
within twelve months of the termination of the merger agreement, that
     party either completes an Acquisition, as defined below, with such
     person, or enters into an agreement providing for an Acquisition with
     such person and that Acquisition is later consummated at any time,
     provided that such party had entered into the agreement during the
     twelve-month period.

   
In any such case, the termination fee shall be payable within two days of
the closing of an Acquisition.
Any termination fee paid shall constitute
liquidated damages to the receiving party and the paying party shall have no
further liability for the action that triggered the termination fee.

   
An Acquisition is any of the following:

  .  
a merger, consolidation, business combination, recapitalization,
     liquidation, dissolution or similar transaction involving a party in
     which its stockholders immediately preceding the transaction hold less
     than 50% of the aggregate equity interests in the surviving entity of
     the transaction or its parent;

  .  
a sale or other disposition by a party of assets representing in excess
     of 50% of the aggregate fair market value of its business immediately
     prior to the sale; or

  .  
the acquisition by any person or group, including by way of a tender
     offer or an exchange offer or issuance by a party, directly or
     indirectly, of beneficial ownership or a right to acquire beneficial
     ownership of shares representing in excess of 50% of the voting power of
     the then outstanding shares of its capital stock.


Amendment, Extension and Waiver of the Merger Agreement

   Kana and Broadbase may amend the merger agreement before completing the
merger, provided that they comply with applicable state law in amending the
agreement.
Either party may extend the other's time for the performance of any
of the obligations or other acts under the merger agreement, waive any
inaccuracies in the other's representations and warranties and waive compliance
by the other with any of the agreements or conditions in the merger agreement.

                               
RELATED AGREEMENTS

   This section describes agreements related to the merger agreement, including
the stock option agreements, the voting agreements, the distribution and
license agreement and the revolving loan agreement.
While we believe that these
descriptions cover the material terms of these agreements, these summaries may
not contain all of the information that is important to you.
The form of Kana
stockholders' voting agreement is attached as Appendix II, the form of
Broadbase stockholders' voting agreement is attached as Appendix III, the Kana
stock option agreement is attached as Appendix IV, the Broadbase stock option
agreement is attached as Appendix V, the distribution and license agreement is
attached as Appendix VI and the revolving loan agreement is attached as
Appendix VII.
We urge you to read each of these agreements carefully in their
entirety.


The Voting Agreements

   Kana required some Broadbase stockholders, including Broadbase's executive
officers, directors and affiliates, to enter into voting agreements as an
inducement for Kana to enter into the merger agreement.
These persons
collectively held approximately 11.7% of the outstanding Broadbase common stock
as of April 9, 2001 (including shares issuable upon exercise of options
exercisable within 60 days of April 9, 2001).

   
In addition, Broadbase required some Kana stockholders, including Kana's
executive officers, directors and affiliates, to enter into voting agreements
as an inducement for Broadbase to enter into the merger agreement.
These
persons collectively held approximately 20.4% of the outstanding Kana common
stock as of April 9, 2001 (including shares issued upon exercise of options
exercisable within 60 days of April 9, 2001).

   
The form of the voting agreements entered into by these stockholders is
attached to this joint proxy statement/prospectus as Appendix II, in the case
of the Kana stockholders, and Appendix III, in the case of the Broadbase
stockholders.
We encourage you to read both of these agreements in their
entirety.

   
Under the voting agreements, these persons agreed:

  .  
in the case of Broadbase stockholders, to vote all shares of Broadbase
     common stock that they beneficially own:

    .  
in favor of:

          .  
the merger;

             or merger agreement, to the extent that a vote is solicited in
             connection with those documents;

    .  
and against:

          .  
any action or agreement that would result in breach of any
             representation, warranty, covenant or obligation of Broadbase or
             the merger agreement or that would preclude fulfillment of a
             closing condition of the merger; and

          .  
approval of any proposal made in opposition to, or, in
             competition with, the merger, including any Acquisition Proposal
             or Superior Offer.

  
.  
in the case of Kana stockholders, to vote all shares of Kana common
     stock that they beneficially own:

    .

          .  
the issuance of shares of Kana common stock in the merger;

          .  
the amendment to Kana's second amended and restated certificate
             of incorporation to change its name to "Kana Software, Inc.";

          .  
the execution and delivery by Kana of the merger agreement;

          .  
the adoption and approval of the terms of the merger agreement;

          .

             or merger agreement, to the extent that a vote is solicited in
             connection with those documents;

    .  
and against:

          .  
any action or agreement that would result in breach of any
             representation, warranty, covenant or obligation of Kana or the
             merger agreement or that would preclude fulfillment of a closing
             condition of the merger; and

          .  
approval of any proposal made in opposition to, or, in
             competition with, the merger, including any Acquisition Proposal
             or Superior Offer.

   
Concurrently with the execution of the voting agreement, each stockholder
also delivered an irrevocable proxy to the other company granting the board of
directors of the other company the right to vote the shares covered by the
voting agreement in favor of the matters described above.

   
None of the persons who entered into a voting agreement were paid additional
consideration in connection with the voting agreements.
The voting agreements
will terminate upon the earlier to occur of the effective time of the merger or
the valid termination of the merger agreement under Section 7 of the merger
agreement.


The Stock Option Agreements

   Under the Kana stock option agreement, Kana granted Broadbase an option to
buy up to a number of shares of Kana common stock equal to 19.9% of the
outstanding shares of Kana common stock as of the date of exercise of the
option (less any amount of shares issued to Broadbase upon the conversion of
debt outstanding under the revolving loan agreement) at an exercise price of
$0.875 per share.
Based on the number of shares of Kana common stock
outstanding on April 9, 2001, the option would be exercisable for approximately
18,770,797 shares of Kana common stock.

   
Under the Broadbase stock option agreement, Broadbase granted Kana an option
to buy up to a number of shares of Broadbase common stock equal to 19.9% of the
outstanding shares of Broadbase common stock on the date of exercise of the
option at an exercise price of $0.7188 per share.
Based on the number of shares
of Broadbase common stock outstanding on April 9, 2001, the option would be
exercisable for approximately 16,330,708 shares of Broadbase common stock.

   
Each of Broadbase and Kana required the other to grant these stock options
as a prerequisite to entering into the merger agreement.
The Kana stock option
agreement is attached to this joint proxy statement/prospectus as Appendix IV,
and the Broadbase stock option agreement is attached to this joint proxy
statement/prospectus as Appendix V. We urge you to read both of these
agreements in their entirety.
In this section, the grantor of the option,
whether Kana or Broadbase, is referred to as the grantor, and the holder of the
option, whether Broadbase or Kana, is referred to as the option holder.

   
These options are intended to increase the likelihood that the merger will
be completed.
Provisions of the stock option agreements may have the effect of
discouraging persons who might now or at any time be interested in acquiring
all or a significant interest in either of us before closing the merger.
The
number of shares issuable upon exercise of each option and the exercise price
of each option are subject to adjustment under specified circumstances to
prevent dilution.

   
Neither option is currently exercisable.
The option holder may exercise the
option in whole or in part and from time to time only if one or more of the
following occurs:

  .  
a Triggering Event, as defined in the merger agreement, as described
     above on page 92;

  .  
the public announcement of an acquisition or purchase by any person or
     group of more than a 30% beneficial ownership interest in the total
     outstanding voting securities of the grantor; or

  .  
the public announcement or commencement of any tender offer or exchange
     offer that if completed would result in any person or group beneficially
     owning 30% or more of the total outstanding voting securities of the
     grantor.

   
The option will terminate upon the earliest of any of the following:

  .  
the effective time of the merger;

  .  
the termination of the merger agreement by mutual written consent duly
     authorized by the boards of Kana and Broadbase;

  .  
the termination of the merger agreement by either Kana or Broadbase,
     prior to a Triggering Event, as described above, upon a breach of any
     representation, warranty, covenant or agreement on the part of the other
     in the merger agreement, or if any of the other's representations or
     warranties are or become untrue, so that the corresponding condition to
     closing the applicable merger would not be met (subject in either case
     to any applicable cure periods);

  .  
the termination of the merger agreement by either Kana or Broadbase,
     prior to a Triggering Event, if:

   .  
the merger is not completed by October 31, 2001;

   .  
if a governmental authority has issued an order, decree or ruling or
      taken any other action that is final and non-appealable; or

   .  
if the required approvals of the stockholders of Broadbase or Kana are
      not received; or

  .  
12 months after termination of the merger agreement in other
     circumstances;

except that if the option is exercisable but cannot be exercised due to
government order or because the waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act
related to the issuance of the shares underlying the option has not expired or
been terminated, or because any other condition to closing has not been
satisfied, then the option will not terminate until the tenth business day
after this impediment to exercise has been removed or, in the case of a
government order, has become final and not subject to appeal.

   
If the total of any termination fee received by the option holder pursuant
to the merger agreement plus the proceeds the option holder receives in
connection with any sales or other dispositions of the option or shares
purchased by exercising the option, plus any dividends on these shares exceed
the total of $2.5 million plus the aggregate exercise price paid upon exercise
of the option, then the option holder must promptly remit all excess proceeds
in cash to the grantor.

   
The stock option agreement may not be exercised unless:

  .
all material consents, approvals, orders or authorizations of, or
    registrations, declarations or filings with, any United States federal,
    state, or local administrative agency or commission or other United
    States federal, state or local governmental authority or instrumentality,
    if any, required in connection with the issuance of the option shares
    pursuant to the stock option agreement have been obtained or made, as the
    case may be; and

  .
no preliminary or permanent injunction or other order by any court of
    competent jurisdiction in the United States prohibiting or otherwise
    restraining such issuance is in effect.

   
The stock option agreements grant registration rights to Broadbase and Kana
with respect to the shares of Kana common stock or Broadbase common stock
represented by the respective options.
In addition, under each agreement, the
grantor and the option holder agree to indemnify the other against specified
liabilities and expenses, including liabilities under the Securities Act.


Distribution and License Agreement

   Kana and Broadbase entered into a distribution and license agreement
concurrently with the merger agreement.
Under this license, Kana and Broadbase
each granted to the other a world-wide, nontransferable, nonexclusive, royalty-
bearing license to all of the other's intellectual property rights to use,
copy, distribute, display and perform all of the software owned by the other
and software, products and services offered by the other to third parties.
The
source code for the licensed products will be placed in escrow to be released
only upon the occurrence of certain bankruptcy-related events, upon a complete
cessation of one party's business or upon a failure by one party that is not
cured to provide maintenance and support in accordance with standard terms.

   
In consideration of the grant of the license, Kana and Broadbase each agreed
to pay to the other royalties equal to 10% of the net revenue from the
distribution and other commercial exploitation of the licensed products on a
stand-alone basis.
If the licensed products are bundled with Kana or
Broadbase's own products, then the royalties will equal 10% of the portion of
the net revenue that is reasonably attributable to the licensed products.
No
royalties are due with respect to products that are used internally by Kana or
Broadbase for activities that do not generate revenues or for evaluation or
promotional purposes.

   
The license agreement will continue for five years from April 9, 2001, and
will renew automatically for additional one year terms unless either party
provides the other with notice of termination at least 60 days prior to the end
of the then-current term.
If Kana or Broadbase is not in default under the
license, either may terminate the agreement upon a material breach by the other
that is not cured within 30 days of written notice of the breach.
The attempted
assignment of rights by, or the change of control of, either party without the
consent of the other party shall give the non-assigning party or party not
undergoing a change of control the right to immediately terminate the license
granted by it.


Revolving Loan Agreement

   Kana and Broadbase entered into a revolving loan agreement concurrently with
the merger agreement.
Under this loan agreement, Broadbase agreed to make
available to Kana a revolving credit facility up to an aggregate principal
amount of $20.0 million.
The facility may be used to pay payroll and other
expenses.
The credit facility will be available until the earlier to occur of:

  .  
the effectiveness of the merger;

  .  
the effective date of any termination of the merger agreement; or

  .  
the Maturity Date, as described below on page 99.

   
If a Triggering Event, as described above under "The Stock Option
Agreements," occurs with respect to Broadbase, Kana will be entitled to draw
down the entire amount of the credit facility.
As of May 17, 2001, Kana has
drawn down $8.2 million under the revolving loan agreement.
Of this amount,
$6.8 million was used to fund a deposit account that Kana is required to
maintain with Silicon Valley Bank, with whom Kana has an existing credit
facility, and $1.4 million will be used to fund Kana's payroll and operating
expenses.
The remaining $11.8 million available under the revolving loan
agreement will be placed in an escrow account to fund any future drawdowns by
Kana under that agreement.
Kana's obligations to Broadbase under the revolving
loan agreement have been fully subordinated to up to $10.0 million of Kana's
obligations to Silicon Valley Bank.

   
Kana and Broadbase agreed upon a form of convertible promissory note to be
issued by Kana to Broadbase in exchange for any amounts loaned by Broadbase to
Kana.
The outstanding principal amount under the note will accrue interest at a
rate equal to the prime rate plus 2% per year, compounded quarterly.
The note
will be due on the Maturity Date, unless the note has previously been converted
at Broadbase's option into shares of Kana's common stock, as described below.

   
The Maturity Date for the credit facility shall be April 9, 2002, unless:

  .  
the merger agreement is terminated before April 9, 2002 by Kana upon a
     willful breach by Broadbase of any representation, warranty, covenant or
     other agreement of Broadbase in the merger agreement, in which case the
     Maturity Date will be extended to one year after the date of such
     termination;

  .  
the merger agreement is terminated before April 9, 2002 by Broadbase
     upon a willful breach by Kana of any representation, warranty, covenant
     or agreement of Kana in the merger agreement, by the mutual agreement of
     Kana and Broadbase, or upon certain other specified events, in which
     case the Maturity Date will be 30 days after the date of such
     termination; or

  .  
Kana executes an agreement to be acquired, in which case the Maturity
     Date will be 30 days after the date of such agreement.

   
Broadbase may elect at any time beginning on July 16, 2001 to convert all or
any part of any outstanding principal and accrued interest of the note into
shares of Kana's common stock at a price of $1.10 per share.
This price will be
adjusted for stock splits, stock dividends and other recapitalizations.
In no
event, however, may the total amount converted under the note, when counted
together with the shares acquired under the stock option agreement in favor of
Broadbase described above, exceed 19.9% of Kana's total outstanding shares of
common stock.

   
Upon and during the continuation of an event of default under the agreement,
Broadbase will no longer be obligated to make advances to Kana and may declare
any obligations of Kana under the agreement to be immediately due and payable.

Events of default under the agreement include:

  .  
Kana's failing to pay any principal amount within five days of when due
     and payable;

  .  
Kana's failing to pay any interest, fees or other amounts within five
     days of when due and payable;

  .  
Kana's failing to perform any of its covenants under the agreement and
     such failure continuing for 30 days after notice of the default by
     Broadbase.
Covenants in the loan agreement include:

   .  using the proceeds for purposes different from those set forth in the
      borrowing request for a loan;

   .  not permitting inspections by Broadbase of all records, financial
      information and properties;

   .  not maintaining its corporate existence and using commercially
      reasonable efforts to maintain the intellectual property necessary to
      conduct its business; or

   .  
merging or liquidating, or permitting any of its subsidiaries to merge
      or liquidate, other than as contemplated by the merger agreement;

  .  
any representation or warranty made by Kana in the loan documents being
     proven to have been untrue or incorrect when made; and

  .  
Kana becoming subject to various bankruptcy proceedings.

               UNAUDITED PRO FORMA COMBINED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

   The following unaudited pro forma combined financial statements have been
prepared to give effect to the proposed merger of Kana and Broadbase, the
merger of Kana and Silknet, and the merger of Broadbase and Servicesoft, using
the purchase method of accounting.
These pro forma statements were prepared as
if the mergers had been completed as of the beginning of the respective periods
for statement of operations purposes and as of March 31, 2001 for balance sheet
purposes.

   
The unaudited pro forma combined financial statements are presented for
illustrative purposes only and are not necessarily indicative of the financial
position or results of operations that would have actually been reported had

The pro forma combined financial statements include adjustments,
which are based upon preliminary estimates, to reflect the allocation of
purchase consideration to the acquired assets and liabilities of Broadbase,
before any integration or restructuring adjustments.
The final allocation of
the purchase consideration will be determined after the completion of the
merger and will be based on appraisals and a comprehensive final evaluation of
the fair value of all assets and liabilities assumed as considered appropriate.

The pro forma adjustments may differ materially based upon the final
allocation.

   
These unaudited pro forma combined financial statements are based upon the
respective historical consolidated financial statements of Kana, Broadbase,
Silknet and Servicesoft and should be read in conjunction with the historical

                              FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

1. BASIS OF PRO FORMA PRESENTATION

   On April 9, 2001, Kana and Broadbase entered into a merger agreement whereby
each outstanding share of Broadbase common stock will be converted into 1.05
shares of Kana common stock.
Each outstanding option and warrant to purchase
shares of Broadbase common stock will be assumed using the 1.05 ratio.

Completion of the merger is conditioned upon the affirmative vote of both
companies' stockholders, among other conditions.
Kana expects to issue
approximately 86.2 million shares of Kana common stock and reserve
approximately 28.1 million shares of common stock to assume Broadbase's
outstanding options and warrants to purchase common stock in connection with
the merger agreement.
The actual number of shares of Kana common stock to be
issued will be determined on the effective date of the merger based on the
number of shares of Broadbase common stock actually outstanding on such date.

Kana intends to account for the merger under the purchase method of accounting.

   
The unaudited pro forma combined balance sheet at March 31, 2001 combines
Kana's and Broadbase's consolidated financial statements at March 31, 2001 as
if the merger had been consummated on that date.
The unaudited pro forma
combined statements of operations for the year ended December 31, 2000 and for
the three months ended March 31, 2001 give effect to the proposed merger of
Kana and Broadbase, the merger of Kana and Silknet and the acquisition by
Broadbase of Servicesoft as if each transaction had been consummated as of the
beginning of the respective periods.


2. PRELIMINARY PURCHASE PRICE

   
The unaudited pro forma combined financial statements reflect an estimated
purchase price of approximately $105.2 million, measured using the average fair
market value of Kana's common stock from April 5, 2001 to April 11, 2001, five
trading days surrounding the date the merger agreement with Broadbase was
announced, plus the value of the options and warrants to be issued by Kana in
the merger, and other costs directly related to the merger as follows (in
thousands):

     Fair market value of Kana's common stock.........................
$ 81,200
     Fair market value of options and warrants assumed................   17,600
     Estimated acquisition related costs..............................    6,400
                                                                       --------
       Total consideration............................................
$105,200
                                                                       ========

   The final purchase price is dependent on the actual number of shares of
common stock exchanged, the actual number of options and warrants assumed, and
actual acquisition related costs.
The final purchase price will be determined
upon completion of the merger.
The preliminary purchase price allocation, which
is subject to change based on Kana's final analysis, is as follows (in
thousands):

     Tangible assets acquired......................................... $160,787
     Deferred compensation............................................   11,450
     Liabilities assumed..............................................  (43,046)
     Deferred credit--negative goodwill...............................  (23,991)
                                                                       --------
       Total .........................................................

3.
PRO FORMA ADJUSTMENTS

Balance Sheet

   The accompanying unaudited pro forma combined balance sheet has been
prepared as if the merger was completed on March 31, 2001 and reflects the
following pro forma adjustments:

    (a) To reduce the carrying amount of certain Broadbase long-term assets
       to $0 due to the fair value of the acquired assets exceeding the
       purchase price (negative goodwill).

    
(b) To eliminate Broadbase historical goodwill.
Due to the fair value
       of the acquired assets exceeding the purchase price (negative
       goodwill), no value has been assigned to the developed technology,
       in-process technology, workforce and other acquired intangible
       assets acquired from Broadbase.

    
(c) To record estimated direct merger costs of approximately $6.4
        million to be incurred by Kana and approximately $4.8 million of
        estimated merger costs to be incurred by Broadbase.

    
(d)
To reduce the Broadbase deferred revenue to estimated fair value.

    
(e) To record deferred credit-negative goodwill resulting from the
        merger as the fair value of the acquired assets exceeds the
        purchase price.

    
(f) To eliminate the historical stockholders' equity of Broadbase and
        record the Kana shares, options and warrants issued in the merger.


Statement of Operations

   The accompanying unaudited pro forma combined statements of operations have
been prepared as if the proposed merger of Kana and Broadbase, the merger of
Kana and Silknet and the acquisition by Broadbase of Servicesoft were each
completed as of January 1, 2000 and reflects the following pro forma
adjustments:

    (g) To eliminate amortization of Broadbase and Servicesoft historical
        goodwill and other purchased intangible assets.
No additional
        goodwill amortization has been recorded for the Silknet merger for
        the period prior to the merger due to the goodwill impairment
        charge recorded in the fourth quarter of 2000.

    
(h) To record amortization of deferred stock-based compensation
        resulting from the merger of Kana and Broadbase and for the year
        ended December 31, 2000, the merger of Broadbase and Servicesoft.

    
(i)
To record the amortization of deferred credit-negative goodwill
        resulting from the merger of Kana and Broadbase on a straight line
        basis over a three year period.

    
(j) Reflects issuance by Kana of approximately 86.2 million shares of
        common stock in connection with the merger with Broadbase and for
        the year ended December 31, 2000, an additional approximately 8.7
        million shares related to the merger with Silknet.
Shares used to
        calculate unaudited pro forma net loss per share exclude the anti-
        dilutive effect of Kana's stock options including options to be
        issued in the merger.

    
(k) Reflects Silknet's results of operations for the period from
        January 1, 2000 through April 19, 2000 prior to the acquisition of
        Silknet by Kana on April 20, 2000.

    
(l) Reflects Servicesoft's results of operations for the period from
        January 1, 2000 through December 15, 2000 prior to the acquisition
        of Servicesoft by Broadbase on December 18, 2000.

On May

common stock will receive in the merger may increase or decrease prior to and
following the merger.
Stockholders are urged to obtain current market
quotations for Kana common stock and Broadbase common stock.
No assurance can

common stock.

                        
COMPARISON OF STOCKHOLDER RIGHTS

   This section of the joint proxy statement/prospectus describes some of the
differences between the rights of holders of Broadbase common stock and Kana
common stock.
This section does not include a complete description of all
differences among the rights of these stockholders, nor does it include a
complete description of the specific rights of these stockholders.
In addition,
the identification of some differences in the rights of these stockholders as
material is not intended to indicate that other differences that are equally
important or that you deem important do not exist.
Therefore, this summary is
qualified by reference to Delaware Law, Kana's certificate of incorporation and
bylaws, and Broadbase's certificate of incorporation and bylaws.
You should
carefully read this entire joint proxy statement/prospectus and any other
documents to which we refer for a more complete understanding of the
differences between being a stockholder of Kana and being a stockholder of
Broadbase.

   
Kana and Broadbase are both organized under the laws of the State of
Delaware.
Any differences, therefore, in the rights of holders of Kana common
stock and Broadbase common stock arise primarily from differences in their
respective restated certificates of incorporation, bylaws and rights
agreements.
Upon completion of the merger, holders of Broadbase common stock
will become holders of Kana common stock and, consequently, their rights will
be governed by the Kana restated certificate of incorporation and restated
bylaws.
However, the rights of holders of Broadbase common stock following the
merger will continue to be governed by Delaware law.

   
Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaw Provisions.
Kana's and Broadbase's
certificates of incorporation and bylaws include provisions that may have the
effect of discouraging, delaying or preventing a change in control or an
unsolicited acquisition proposal that a stockholder might consider favorable,
including a proposal that might result in the payment of a premium over the
market price for the shares held by holders of Kana and Broadbase common stock.

   
Capital Stock.
Broadbase's certificate of incorporation provides that
Broadbase's authorized capital stock consists of 90,000,000 shares of common
stock, $0.001 par value, and 5,000,000 shares of preferred stock, $0.001 par
value.
Kana's authorized capital stock consists of 1,000,000,000 shares of
common stock, par value $0.001 per share, and 5,000,000 shares of preferred
stock, par value $0.001 per share.

   
Classified Board.
Delaware law provides that a corporation's board of
directors may be divided into various classes with staggered terms of office.

The boards of directors for both Broadbase and Kana are divided into three
classes with staggered three-year terms.
The classification of each board has
the effect of requiring at least two annual stockholder meetings, instead of
one, to replace a majority of the members of either company's board of
directors.

   
Number and Election of Directors.
Under Delaware law, a corporation may fix
the number of directors or the process by which to do so in either its
certificate of incorporation or bylaws.
In order to be elected as a director, a
person shall have received a plurality of the votes of shares present and
entitled to vote.
When electing directors in a Delaware corporation,
stockholders do not have cumulative voting rights unless the corporation's
certificate of incorporation so provides.

   
Pursuant to both Kana's and Broadbase's respective certificates of
incorporation, the size of the board of directors of each shall be determined
by resolution of the board of directors.
The size of the Kana board is set at
nine members while the size of Broadbase's is five members.
The directors of
both Kana and Broadbase are elected as mandated by Delaware law.
Neither Kana
nor Broadbase have instituted cumulative voting.

   
Vacancy on the Board of Directors and Removal of Directors.
Delaware law
allows any vacancy on the board of directors to be filled by a majority of the
directors then in office, although less than a quorum, or by a sole remaining
director, unless otherwise provided for in the certificate of incorporation or
bylaws.
Also, directors of Delaware corporations with staggered boards may only
be removed at an election of directors for cause by a majority of shares
entitled to vote at such meeting.

   
Both Kana and Broadbase have adopted Delaware's provisions for filling board
vacancies and for the removal of any of either company's directors.
Currently,
Kana has three vacancies on its board of directors and Broadbase has one.
If
the merger is consummated, then immediately following the merger Kana would
have four vacancies on its board of directors.
These provisions prevent a
stockholder from enlarging the board of directors and filling the new
directorships with such stockholder's own nominees without the approval of the
existing board of directors.

   
Directors' Committees.
Under Delaware law, a board of directors may
designate one or more committees, which consist of one or more directors.

Except as provided for in the resolution of the board of directors or the
bylaws, a committee of a Delaware corporation shall have and exercise all the
powers and authority of the board of directors in the management of the
business and affairs of the corporation.
However, no such committee shall have
power to approve, adopt, or recommend to the stockholders, any action or matter
require by law to be submitted to the stockholders for approval or to adopt,
amend, or repeal any bylaw of the corporation.
Kana's bylaws provide that the
board of directors may by the vote of a majority of the board of directors
designate one or more committees of the board, each comprised of one or more
members of the board.
To the extent provided in a resolution of Kana's board of
directors, these committees may exercise all the powers and authority of the
board of directors in the management of Kana, including, if the resolution
expressly provides, the declaration of a dividend or the issuance of stock,
except that no committee may:

  .
amend Kana's certificate of incorporation or bylaws;

  .
adopt an agreement of merger or consolidation;

  .
recommend the sale, lease or exchange of all or substantially all of
    Kana's assets; or

  .
recommend dissolution or revocation of a dissolution of Kana.

   
Broadbase's bylaws provide that a majority of the board of directors may
designate one or more committees of the board.
To the extent provided in a
resolution of the Broadbase board of directors, any committees of the Broadbase
board of directors may exercise all the powers and authority of the board in
the management of the business and affairs of Broadbase, except that no
committee may:

  .
approve or adopt, or recommend to Broadbase's stockholders, any action or
    matter expressly required by law to be submitted to stockholders for
    approval; or

  .
adopt, amend or repeal any bylaws of Broadbase.

   
Supermajority Voting.
Kana's certificate of incorporation requires the
approval of the holders of 66 2/3% of its outstanding voting stock to effect
certain amendments to the certificate of incorporation with respect to:

  .
the vote necessary to amend its bylaws or certificate of incorporation;

  .
the size, classification and method of election of its board of
    directors;

  .
the conduct of stockholders' meetings and stockholder action by written
    consent; and

  .
indemnification of its directors, officers and others.

   
In addition, Kana's certificate of incorporation provides that directors are
removable only by the vote of the holders of 66 2/3% of Kana's outstanding
voting capital stock.
Kana's bylaws may be amended by the majority vote of the
board of directors or by the vote of the holders of 66 2/3% of Kana's
outstanding voting capital stock.
Neither Broadbase's certificate of
incorporation nor its bylaws require a supermajority vote of Broadbase's
stockholders to approve any action.

   
Special Meeting of Stockholders.
Delaware law provides that the board of
directors or any other person may call a special meeting of stockholders as so
authorized by a corporation's charter documents.
Kana's certificate of
incorporation provides that special meetings of stockholders of Kana may only
be called by its board of directors.
This provision prevents Kana stockholders
from initiating or effecting any action by calling a special meeting of the
stockholders.

   
Broadbase's bylaws provide that special meetings of stockholders of
Broadbase may only be called by the board of directors, the chairperson of the
board of directors, a majority of the members of the board of directors,
Broadbase's chief executive officer, Broadbase's president or the holders of
shares that are entitled to cast at least a ten-percent of the total number of
votes entitled to be cast by all stockholders at such meeting.

   
No Stockholder Action by Written Consent.
Unless otherwise indicated in a
corporation's certificate of incorporation, stockholders of a Delaware
corporation are entitled by law to take any action without a meeting, prior
notice or vote if holders of enough shares of voting stock to carry the action
at such a meeting consent in writing to take such action without a stockholder
meeting.
Kana's certificate of incorporation provides that Kana's stockholders
may take action only at an annual or special meeting of stockholders of Kana
and shall have no right to take any action by written consent without a
meeting.
Broadbase's certificate of incorporation and bylaws similarly provide
that stockholder action may only be taken at a duly called annual or special
meeting of stockholders and may not be taken by written consent.
These
provisions, taken together, prevent stockholders from forcing consideration by
the stockholders of stockholder proposals over the opposition of the board of
directors, except at an annual or special meeting.

   
Record Date for Determining Stockholders.
Delaware provides that the board
may fix a date to determine the stockholders entitled to notice of and vote at
any meeting of stockholders that is not more than 60 days nor less than 10 days
before the date of such meeting.
Both Kana and Broadbase have adopted this
provision.

   
Notice of Board Nominations and Other Stockholder Business--Annual
Meetings.
Delaware provides that any proper business may be transacted at a
corporation's annual meeting.
Kana's bylaws establish advance notice procedures
with respect to all stockholder proposals to be brought before meetings of
stockholders of Kana, including proposals relating to board nominations, the
removal of directors and amendments to its certificate of incorporation or
bylaws.
These procedures provide that such notice must contain the consent of
any nominee for election to the board of directors as well as certain
information with respect to such nominee, a brief description of and reasons
for any business desired to be brought before a meeting, the ownership interest
of the proposing stockholder and certain other information.
Generally, to be
timely, notice must be received by Kana's secretary not less than 120 days
prior to the meeting.

   
Under the notice procedure in its bylaws, Broadbase must receive notice of
stockholder nominations or proposals to be made at an annual not less than 60
days nor more than 90 days prior to the first anniversary of the date of the
preceding year's annual meeting.
In the event that the date of the annual
meeting is either thirty days before or sixty days after such anniversary date,
Broadbase must receive notice not less than 60 days nor more than 90 days prior
to such date or 10 days following the day on which Broadbase publicly announces
its annual meeting.
However, if the number of directors to be elected to the
board of directors is increased and Broadbase fails to make a public
announcement naming all of the nominees for director or specifying the size of
the increased board of directors at least 70 days prior to the first
anniversary of the preceding year's annual meeting, then notice must be
received not later than the 10th day following the day such public disclosure
was made.
In such case, the notice will be timely only with respect to any
director nominees for any position caused by the increase in the board of
directors.

   
Adequate notice to Broadbase stockholders must contain:

  .
for each proposed board nominee, all information required to be disclosed
    about such person for a solicitation of proxies or pursuant to Regulation
    14A under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and the
    written consent of the person nominated;

  .
as to all other proposed business, a brief description of the proposal,
    the reasons for presenting the proposal at the annual meeting, and any
    material interest of the proposing stockholder or any related beneficial
    owner, if necessary; and

  .
if proposed on behalf of a beneficial owner, the name and address of the
    proposing stockholder and beneficial owner and the class and numbers of
    shares owned by the proposing stockholder and the beneficial owner.

   
Neither Broadbase's nor Kana's bylaws give their respective boards of
directors any power to approve or disapprove stockholder board nominations or
proposals for annual meetings.
However, if Kana's or Broadbase's proper advance
notice procedures are not followed with respect to a particular nomination or
proposal, then the nomination or proposal will not be considered at the annual
meeting without regard to whether consideration, or the lack thereof, of such
nominees or proposals might be harmful or beneficial to Kana, Broadbase, or
either company's stockholders.
The notice procedure of each company may prevent
a contest for the election of directors or the consideration of stockholder
proposals at an annual meeting.
These procedures could also deter a third party
from conducting a solicitation of proxies to elect its own slate of directors
or to approve its own proposal at an annual meeting.

   
Notice of Board Nominations and Other Stockholder Business--Special
Meetings.
Delaware law does not mandate any particular procedures for
stockholders to provide adequate notice of any proposed business.
Kana's bylaws
do not distinguish between the procedure for providing notice of board
nominations and other stockholder business for its annual meetings of
stockholders and those for its special meetings of stockholders.

   
Broadbase's certificate of incorporation limits the business transacted at a
special meeting of stockholders to those purposes stated in the notice of such
meeting.
The bylaws of Broadbase require that notice of stockholder nominations
to be made at a special meeting called by the board of directors for the
purpose of electing one or more directors must be received not earlier than the
90th day prior to such special meeting nor later than the close of business on
the 60th day prior to such special meeting or the 10th day following the day
public disclosure of the special meeting and the nominees proposed by the board
of directors to be elected at such meeting was made.
These notices must contain
the same information as those for the annual meeting.

   
Neither Broadbase's nor Kana's bylaws give the board of directors any power
to approve or disapprove stockholder board nominations or proposals for special
meetings.
However, if Kana's or Broadbase's proper advance notice procedures
are not followed with respect to a particular nomination or proposal, then the
nomination or proposal will not be considered at the special meeting without
regard to whether consideration, or the lack thereof, of such nominees or
proposals might be harmful or beneficial to Kana, Broadbase, or either
company's stockholders.
The notice procedure of each company may prevent a
contest for the election of directors or the consideration of stockholder
proposals at a special meeting.
These procedures could also deter a third party
from conducting a solicitation of proxies to elect its own slate of directors
or to approve its own proposal at a special meeting.

   
Limitations of Liability of Directors.
Kana's certificate of incorporation
eliminates, to the maximum extent allowed by the Delaware General Corporation
Law, a director's personal liability to Kana or its stockholders for monetary
damages for breaches of fiduciary duties.
The certificate of incorporation does
not, however, eliminate or limit the personal liability of a director for the
following:

  .
any breach of the director's duty of loyalty to Kana or its stockholders;

  .
acts or omissions not in good faith or that involve intentional
    misconduct or a knowing violation of law;

  .
unlawful payments of dividends or unlawful stock repurchases or
    redemptions; or

  .
any transaction from which the director derived an improper personal
    benefit.

   
Broadbase's certificate of incorporation similarly eliminates a director's
personal liability to Broadbase or its stockholders for monetary damages for
breaches of fiduciary duties to the maximum extent allowed by the Delaware
General Corporation Law, which currently prevents the elimination or limitation
of personal liability of a director in all those circumstances outlined in
Kana's certificate of incorporation.
However, Broadbase's certificate of
incorporation does not set forth the exclusions that are included in Kana's
certificate of incorporation.

   
Effect of Delaware Anti-takeover Statute.
Kana and Broadbase are subject to
Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, as amended, that prohibits
a Delaware corporation from engaging in any

business combination with any interested stockholder for a period of three
years following the date that such stockholder became an interested
stockholder, unless:

  .
prior to the date the stockholder became an interested stockholder, the
    board of directors of the corporation approved either the business
    combination or the transaction that resulted in the stockholder becoming
    an interested stockholder;

  .
upon consummation of the transaction that resulted in the stockholder
    becoming an interested stockholder, the interested stockholder owned at
    least 85% of the voting stock of the corporation outstanding at the time
    the transaction commenced, excluding for purposes of determining the
    number of shares outstanding those shares owned by persons who are
    directors and also officers and by employee stock plans in which employee
    participants do not have the right to determine confidentially whether
    shares held subject to the plan will be tendered in a tender or exchange
    offer; or

  .
on or subsequent to such date, the business combination is approved by
    the board of directors and authorized at an annual or special meeting of
    stockholders, and not by written consent, by the affirmative vote of at
    least 66 2/3% of the outstanding voting stock that is not owned by the
    interested stockholder.

   
Section 203 defines business combinations to include:

  .
any merger or consolidation involving the corporation and any interested
    stockholder;

  .
any sale, transfer, pledge or other disposition of 10% or more of the
    assets of the corporation involving the interested stockholder;

  .
any transaction that results in the issuance or transfer by the
    corporation of any stock of the corporation to the interested
    stockholder;

  .
any transaction involving the corporation that has the effect of
    increasing the proportionate share of the stock of any class or series of
    the corporation beneficially owned by the interested stockholder; or

  .
the receipt by the interested stockholder of the benefit of any loans,
    advances, guarantees, pledges or other financial benefits provided by or
    through the corporation.

   
In general, Section 203 defines an interested stockholder as any entity or
person beneficially owning 15% or more of the outstanding voting stock of the
corporation and any entity or person affiliated with or controlling or
controlled by such entity or person.

                              
OTHER KANA PROPOSALS

Proposal to Change Kana's Name

   As a condition to the completion of the merger, Kana agreed to use
commercially reasonable efforts to change its name from "Kana Communications,
Inc." to "Kana Software, Inc." Kana believes that "Kana Software, Inc." will
better reflect the Company's current business focus as a result of its recent
acquisitions, including the proposed merger with Broadbase.

   
By approving this proposal, the stockholders will authorize the board to
amend Kana's second amended and restated certificate of incorporation to
reflect this name change.
The amendment to the second amended and restated
certificate of incorporation will take the following form:

   Article I is replaced with a new Article I--"The name of this corporation is
Kana Software, Inc.
(the "Corporation').
"

   Kana expects the formal implementation of the name change with the Delaware
Secretary of State to be completed by the end of summer 2001 after stockholder
approval.
There will be no adverse tax consequences associated with this name
change and it will not affect the rights of any holders of Kana's common stock.

Implementation costs during fiscal year 2001 are not expected to be material.

 
Required Vote

   
The proposal to change Kana's name to "Kana Software, Inc." by amending
Kana's second amended and restated certificate of incorporation requires the
affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of
Kana's common stock.

 
Recommendation of the Board of Directors

   THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS HAS DETERMINED THAT THIS PROPOSAL IS IN THE BEST
INTERESTS OF THE COMPANY AND ITS STOCKHOLDERS AND RECOMMENDS A VOTE FOR THE
APPROVAL OF THE AMENDMENT OF KANA'S SECOND AMENDED AND RESTATED CERTIFICATE OF
INCORPORATION TO CHANGE KANA'S NAME.


Proposal to Amend Kana's 1999 Stock Incentive Plan

   The Kana stockholders are being asked to approve an amendment of the 1999
Stock Incentive Plan which will increase the number of shares of Kana common
stock available for issuance under the 1999 Stock Incentive Plan by an
additional 15,000,000 shares.

   
The amendment will also increase the limit on the maximum number of shares
by which the share reserve under the 1999 Stock Incentive Plan may
automatically increase each calendar year from 6,000,000 shares to 10,000,000
shares, effective for all calendar years after 2001.

   
The increase to the share reserve will allow Kana to continue to utilize
equity incentives to attract and retain the services of key individuals
essential to its long-term growth and financial success.
Equity incentives play
a significant role in the company's efforts to remain competitive in the market
for talented individuals, and Kana relies on such incentives as a means to
attract and retain highly qualified individuals in the positions vital to its
success.

   
All share numbers in this proposal reflect the two-for-one split of the Kana
common stock which was effected on February 22, 2000 through the payment of a
dividend of one additional share of common stock for each share of Kana common
stock outstanding on January 28, 2000.

   
The following is a summary of the principal features of the 1999 Stock
Incentive Plan, as most recently amended, a copy of which is attached to this
joint proxy statement/prospectus as Appendix X.
The 1999 Stock Incentive Plan
serves as the successor to Kana's 1997 Stock Option/Stock Issuance Plan which
terminated in connection with the initial public offering of our common stock
on September 21, 1999.
All outstanding options under the 1997 plan at the time
of such termination were transferred to the 1999 Stock Incentive Plan.

 
Equity Incentive Programs

   The 1999 Stock Incentive Plan consists of five separate equity incentive
programs: (i) the discretionary option grant program, (ii) the stock issuance
program, (iii) the salary investment option grant program, (iv) the automatic
option grant program for non-employee board members and (v) the director fee
option grant program.
The principal features of each program are described
below.
The compensation committee of Kana's board of directors will have the
exclusive authority to administer the discretionary option grant and stock
issuance programs with respect to option grants and stock issuances made to
Kana's executive officers and non-employee board members and will also have the
authority to make option grants and stock issuances under those programs to all
other eligible individuals.
However, Kana's board of directors may at any time
appoint a secondary committee of one or more board members to have separate but
concurrent authority with the compensation committee to make option grants and
stock issuances under those two programs to individuals other than executive
officers and non-employee board members.
The compensation committee will also
have complete discretion to select the individuals who are to participate in
the salary investment option grant program, but all grants made to the selected
individuals will be governed by the express terms of that program.

   
The term plan administrator, as used in this summary, will mean Kana's
compensation committee and any secondary committee, to the extent each such
entity is acting within the scope of its administrative authority under the
1999 Stock Incentive Plan.
However, neither the compensation committee nor any
secondary committee will exercise any administrative discretion under the
automatic option grant or director fee option grant program.
All grants under
those programs will be made in strict compliance with the express provisions of
such programs.

 
Share Reserve

   At present, 40,982,428 shares of Kana's common stock are reserved for
issuance over the term of the 1999 Stock Incentive Plan.
Such share reserve
consists of (i) the 9,400,000 shares initially reserved for issuance under the
1999 Stock Incentive Plan (including the shares of Kana's common stock subject
to the outstanding options under the predecessor 1997 plan which have been
transferred to the 1999 Stock Incentive Plan) plus (ii) the additional
2,583,100 shares added to the reserve plan on January 3, 2000 pursuant to the
automatic share increase provisions of the 1999 Stock Incentive Plan, plus
(iii) the 10,000,000 share increase approved by the stockholders at the Special
Meeting held on April 25, 2000, plus (iv) the additional 3,999,328 shares added
to the reserve plan on January 2, 2001 pursuant to the automatic share increase
provisions of the 1999 Stock Incentive Plan and (v) the 15,000,000 share
increase which is the subject of this proposal.

   
The number of shares of Kana's common stock available for issuance under the
1999 Stock Incentive Plan will automatically increase on the first trading day
of January each calendar year, beginning with calendar year 2000, by an amount
equal to 4.25% of the total number of shares of Kana's outstanding common stock
on the last trading day in December of the immediately preceding calendar year,
but in no event will any such annual increase exceed 6,000,000 shares.
The
proposed amendment will increase the limit on the maximum number of shares by
which the share reserve under the 1999 Share Incentive Plan may automatically
increase each calendar year from 6,000,000 shares to 10,000,000 shares,
effective for all calendar years after 2001.

   
No participant in the 1999 Stock Incentive Plan may receive option grants,
separately exercisable stock appreciation rights or direct stock issuances for
more than 2,000,000 shares of Kana's common stock in total per calendar year,
subject to adjustment for subsequent stock splits, stock dividends and similar
transactions.
Stockholder approval of this proposal will also constitute re-
approval of the 2,000,000-share limitation for purposes of Internal Revenue
Code Section 162(m).

   
The shares of common stock issuable under the 1999 Stock Incentive Plan may
be drawn from shares of Kana's authorized but unissued common stock or from
shares of Kana's common stock which it acquires, including shares purchased on
the open market.

   
Shares subject to any outstanding options under the 1999 Stock Incentive
Plan (including options transferred from the 1997 plan) which expire or
otherwise terminate prior to exercise will be available for subsequent
issuance.
Unvested shares issued under the 1999 Stock Incentive Plan and
subsequently purchased by Kana, at the option exercise or direct issue price
paid per share, pursuant to Kana's purchase rights under the 1999 Stock
Incentive Plan will be added back to the number of shares reserved for issuance
under the 1999 Stock Incentive Plan and will accordingly be available for
subsequent issuance.
However, any shares subject to stock appreciation rights
exercised under the 1999 Stock Incentive Plan will not be available for
reissuance.

 
Eligibility

   Officers and employees, non-employee board members and independent
consultants in Kana's service or in the service of any parent and subsidiary
companies (whether now existing or subsequently established) will be eligible
to participate in the discretionary option grant and stock issuance programs.

Kana's executive officers and other highly paid employees will also be eligible
to participate in the salary investment option grant program.
Participation in
the automatic option grant and director fee option grant programs will be
limited to the non-employee members of Kana's board of directors.

   
As of April 20, 2001, approximately 585 employees, including five executive
officers and five non-employee board members, were eligible to participate in
the discretionary option grant and stock issuance programs.
The five executive
officers were also eligible to participate in the salary investment option
grant program, and the five non-employee board members were also eligible to
participate in the automatic option grant and director fee option grant
programs.

 
Valuation

   The fair market value per share of Kana's common stock on any relevant date
under the 1999 Stock Incentive Plan will be deemed to be equal to the closing
selling price per share on that date on the Nasdaq National Market.
On April
20, 2001, the fair market value per share of Kana's common stock determined on
such basis was $1.27.

 
Discretionary Option Grant Program

   
The plan administrator will have complete discretion under the discretionary
option grant program to determine which eligible individuals are to receive
option grants, the time or times when those grants are to be made, the number
of shares subject to each such grant, the status of any granted option as
either an incentive stock option or a non- statutory option under the federal
tax laws, the vesting schedule (if any) to be in effect for the option grant
and the maximum term for which any granted option is to remain outstanding.

   
Each granted option will have an exercise price per share determined by the
plan administrator, and that price may be set at a dollar amount less than,
equal to or greater than the fair market value of the option shares on the
grant date.

   
No granted option may have a term in excess of ten years.
The shares subject
to each option will generally vest in one or more installments over a specified
period of service measured from the grant date.
However, one or more options
may be structured so that they will be immediately exercisable for any or all
of the option shares.
The shares acquired under such immediately exercisable
options will be subject to repurchase by Kana, at the exercise price paid per
share, if the optionee ceases service prior to vesting in those shares.

   
Upon cessation of service, the optionee will have a limited period of time
in which to exercise his or her outstanding options to the extent exercisable
for vested shares.
The plan administrator will have complete

discretion to extend the period following the optionee's cessation of service
during which his or her outstanding options may be exercised and/or to
accelerate the exercisability or vesting of such options in whole or in part.

Such discretion may be exercised at any time while the options remain
outstanding, whether before or after the optionee's actual cessation of
service.

   
The plan administrator is authorized to issue tandem stock appreciation
rights under the discretionary option grant program which will provide the
holders with the right to surrender their options to Kana for an appreciation
distribution.
The amount of the distribution payable by Kana will be equal to
the excess of (i) the fair market value of the vested shares of Kana's common
stock subject to the surrendered option over (ii) the aggregate exercise price
payable for those shares.
Such appreciation distribution may, at the discretion
of the plan administrator, be made in cash or in shares of Kana's common stock.

   
The plan administrator will also have the authority to effect the
cancellation of outstanding options under the discretionary option grant
program (including options transferred from the 1997 plan) in return for the
grant of new options for the same or a different number of option shares with
an exercise price per share based upon the fair market value of Kana's common
stock on the new grant date.

 
Salary Investment Option Grant Program

   Kana's compensation committee will have complete discretion in implementing
the salary investment option grant program for one or more calendar years and
in selecting the executive officers and other eligible individuals who are to
participate in the program for those years.
As a condition to such
participation, each selected individual must, prior to the start of the
calendar year of participation, file with the compensation committee an
irrevocable authorization directing Kana to reduce his or her base salary for
the upcoming calendar year by a specified dollar amount not less than $10,000
nor more than $50,000 and to apply that amount to the acquisition of a special
option grant under the program.

   
Each selected individual who files such a timely election will automatically
be granted a non-statutory option on the first trading day in January of the
calendar year for which that salary reduction is to be in effect.
Stockholder
approval of this proposal will also constitute pre-approval of each option
granted under the salary investment option grant program and the subsequent
exercise of that option in accordance with the terms of the program summarized
below.

   
The number of shares subject to each such option will be determined by
dividing the salary reduction amount by two-thirds of the fair market value per
share of Kana common stock on the grant date, and the exercise price will be
equal to one-third of the fair market value of the option shares on the grant
date.
As a result, the total spread on the option shares at the time of grant
(the fair market value of the option shares on the grant date less the
aggregate exercise price payable for those shares) will be equal to the amount
by which the optionee's salary is to be reduced for the calendar year.
In
effect, the salary reduction serves as a prepayment, as of the time of the
option grant, of two-thirds of the then current market price of the shares of
common stock subject to the option.

   
The option will become exercisable in a series of twelve successive equal
monthly installments upon the optionee's completion of each month of service in
the calendar year for which the salary reduction is in effect and will become
immediately exercisable for all the option shares on an accelerated basis
should Kana experience certain changes in ownership or control.
Each option
will remain exercisable for any vested shares until the earlier of (i) the
expiration of the ten-year option term or (ii) the end of the three-year period
measured from the date of the optionee's cessation of service.

 
Stock Issuance Program

   Shares may be issued under the stock issuance program at a price per share
determined by the plan administrator, and such price may be less than, equal to
or greater than the fair market value of the shares at the

time of issuance.
The issue price may be paid in cash or through a full-
recourse promissory note.
Shares may also be issued as a bonus for past
services without any cash outlay required of the recipient.
Shares may also be
issued under the program pursuant to share right awards which entitle the
recipients to receive those shares upon the attainment of designated
performance goals or the completion of a specified service requirement.
The
plan administrator will have complete discretion under the program to determine
which eligible individuals are to receive such stock issuances or share right
awards, the time or times when those issuances or awards are to be made, the
number of shares subject to each such issuance or award, the consideration (if
any) to be paid for the issued shares and the vesting schedule to be in effect
for the stock issuance or share rights award.

   
The issued shares may be fully and immediately vested upon issuance or may
vest upon the completion of a designated service period or the attainment of
pre-established performance goals.
The plan administrator will, however, have
the discretionary authority at any time to accelerate the vesting of any and
all unvested shares outstanding under the stock issuance program.

   
Outstanding share right awards under the program will automatically
terminate, and no shares will actually be issued in satisfaction of those
awards, if the performance goals or service requirements established for such
awards are not attained.
The plan administrator, however, will have the
discretionary authority to issue shares of Kana's common stock in satisfaction
of one or more outstanding share right awards as to which the designated
performance goals or service requirements are not attained.

 
Automatic Option Grant Program

   Under the automatic option grant program, eligible non-employee members of
Kana's board of directors will receive a series of option grants over their
period of board service.
Each new non-employee board member will, at the time
of his or her initial election or appointment to the board, receive an option
grant for 40,000 shares of Kana's common stock, provided such individual has
not previously been in Kana's employ.
On the date of each annual stockholders
meeting, each individual who is to continue to serve as a non-employee board
member will automatically be granted an option to purchase 10,000 shares of
Kana's common stock, provided he or she has served as a non-employee board
member for at least six months.

   
There will be no limit on the number of such 10,000 share annual option
grants any one eligible non-employee board member may receive over his or her
period of continued board service, and non-employee board members who have
previously been in Kana's employ will be eligible to receive one or more such
annual option grants over their period of board service.

   
Stockholder approval of this proposal will also constitute pre-approval of
each option granted under the automatic option grant program on or after the
date of the annual meeting and the subsequent exercise of each such option in
accordance with the terms of the program summarized below.

   
Each automatic grant will have an exercise price per share equal to the fair
market value per share of Kana's common stock on the grant date and will have a
maximum term of 10 years, subject to earlier termination following the
optionee's cessation of board service.
Each automatic option will be
immediately exercisable for all of the option shares.
However, any unvested
shares purchased under such option will be subject to repurchase by Kana, at
the exercise price paid per share, should the optionee cease board service
prior to vesting in those shares.
The shares subject to each initial 40,000
share automatic option grant will vest in a series of 8 successive equal semi-
annual installments upon the optionee's completion of each 6 month period of
board service over the 48 month period measured from the grant date.
However,
the shares subject to each such initial option grant will immediately vest in
full upon certain changes in control or ownership or upon the optionee's death
or disability while a board member.
The shares subject to each annual 10,000
shares automatic grant will be fully vested at the time of the option grant.

Following the optionee's cessation of board service for any reason, each
automatic option grant will remain exercisable for a 12 month period and may be
exercised during that time for any or all shares in which the optionee is
vested at the time of such cessation of board service.

 
Director Fee Option Grant Program

   
The plan administrator will have complete discretion in implementing the
director fee option grant program for one or more calendar years.
If the
program is implemented, each non-employee board member may elect, prior to the
start of each calendar year, to apply all or any portion of any annual retainer
fee otherwise payable in cash for his or her period of service on the board for
that year to the acquisition of a below-market option grant.
The option grant
will be a nonstatutory option and will automatically be made on the first
trading day in January in the calendar year for which an election is in effect.

The option will have a maximum term of 10 years measured from the grant date
and an exercise price per share equal to one-third of the fair market value of
the option shares on such date.
The number of shares subject to each option
will be determined by dividing the amount of the retainer fee applied to the
acquisition of that option by two-thirds of the fair market value per share of
Kana's common stock on the grant date.
As a result, the total spread on the
option (the fair market value of the option shares on the grant date less the
aggregate exercise price payable for those shares) will be equal to the portion
of the retainer fee applied to the acquisition of the option.
In effect, the
director fee election serves as a prepayment, as of the time of the option
grant, of two-thirds of the then current market price of the shares of common
stock subject to the option.

   
The option will become exercisable in a series of twelve successive equal
monthly installments upon the optionee's completion of each month of board
service in the calendar year for which the director fee election is in effect,
subject to full and immediate acceleration upon certain changes in control or
ownership or upon the optionee's death or disability while a board member.
Each
option granted under the program will remain exercisable for vested shares
until the earlier of the expiration of the ten-year option term or the
expiration of the three-year period measured from the date of the optionee's
cessation of board service.

 
Limited Stock Appreciation Rights

   Limited stock appreciation rights may be granted under the discretionary
option grant program to one or more of Kana's officers or non-employee board
members as part of their option grants, and each option granted under the
salary investment option grant, automatic option grant and director fee option
grant program will automatically include such a limited stock appreciation
right.
Upon the successful completion of a hostile tender offer for more than
50% of Kana's outstanding voting securities or a change in a majority of Kana's
board of directors as a result of one or more contested elections for board
membership, each outstanding option with a limited stock appreciation right may
be surrendered to Kana in return for a cash distribution.
The amount of the
distribution per surrendered option share will be equal to the excess of (i)
the fair market value per share at the time the option is surrendered or, if
greater, the highest tender offer price paid per share in the hostile take-over
over (ii) the exercise price payable per share under the surrendered option.

 
Predecessor Plan

   All outstanding options under the predecessor 1997 plan which were
transferred to the 1999 Stock Incentive Plan will continue to be governed by
the terms of the agreements evidencing those options, and no provision of the
1999 Stock Incentive Plan will affect or otherwise modify the rights or
obligations of the holders of the transferred options with respect to their
acquisition of Kana's common stock.
However, the plan administrator has
complete discretion to extend one or more provisions of the 1999 Stock
Incentive Plan to the transferred options, to the extent those options do not
otherwise contain such provisions.

As of April 20, 2001, 16,229,331 shares of Kana's common stock were subject
to outstanding options under the 1999 Stock Incentive Plan, and 23,909,588
shares remained available for future issuance, assuming stockholder approval of
the 10,000,000 share increase which is the subject of this proposal.

   
In addition, on April 26, 2001, Kana implemented a special retention option
grant program under the 1999 Stock Incentive Plan in order to provide the
employees essential to Kana's financial success with a meaningful incentive to
continue in Kana's employ.
Accordingly options covering a total of 9,360,930

(1) This option shall vest and become exercisable in a series of 48 equal
    monthly installments upon the optionee's completion of each of 48 months of
    service following the grant date.


(2) This option shall vest and become exercisable in a series of 24 equal
    monthly installments upon the optionee's completion of each of 24 months of
    service following the grant date.


(3) This option shall vest fully and become exercisable for all the option
    shares upon his continuation in Kana's employ until the earlier to occur of
    February 28, 2002 or the six-month anniversary of the completion of the
    merger with Broadbase.


(4) This option shall vest fully and become exercisable for all the option
    shares upon optionee's continuation in Kana's employ through July 31, 2001.

   
Each option granted under the program, other than those granted to Kana's
current chief executive officer and the four other most highly paid executive
officers, will vest and become exercisable in a series of 48 equal monthly
installments upon the optionee's completion of each of 48 months of service
following the grant date.
In addition, fully vested options covering a total of
197,360 shares were granted to 91 employees in recognition of past services
rendered to Kana.
Each option granted has an exercise price of $1.24 per share,
the closing selling price per share of Kana common stock on the April 26, 2001
grant date and has a maximum term of 10 years measured from the grant date,
subject to earlier termination upon the optionee's cessation of employment.

 
New Plan Benefits

   No options have been granted to date under the 1999 Stock Incentive Plan on
the basis of the share increase which forms part of this proposal.

 
1999 Special Stock Option Plan

   Kana's 1999 Special Stock Option Plan was implemented by the board of
directors in December 1999, and 1,000,000 shares of Kana's common stock have
been reserved for issuance under this plan.
The shares will be made available
from Kana's authorized but unissued shares of common stock or from any common
stock Kana repurchases, whether on the open market or otherwise.
Participation
in the special plan is limited to (i) officers who receive their option grant
under the plan in connection with their commencement of employment with Kana,
whether as a result of Kana's acquisition of their former employer or by reason
of their initial hire, and (ii) employees who are neither officer nor directors
at the time of the option grant.
All options granted under the special plan
will be non-statutory options under the federal tax laws and will not have a
term in excess of ten years.
Kana's compensation committee will serve as the
plan administrator and will have the discretion to grant options under the
special plan with an exercise price less than, equal to or greater than the
fair market value of the option shares on the grant date.
The remaining terms
and provisions of the special plan are substantially the same as those in
effect for the discretionary option grant program of Kana's 1999 Stock

Incentive Plan.
As of April 20, 2001, options for 870,764 shares of Kana's
common stock were outstanding under the special plan with a weighted average
exercise price of $14.24 per share, options for 24,550 shares had been
exercised, and 206,590 shares remained available for future option grant.

 
General Provisions

   Acceleration

   
In the event Kana should undergo a change in control, each outstanding
option under the discretionary option grant program will automatically
accelerate in full, unless assumed or otherwise continued in effect by the
successor corporation or replaced with a cash incentive program which preserves
the spread existing on the unvested option shares (the excess of the fair
market value of those shares over the option exercise price payable for such
shares) and provides for subsequent payout in accordance with the same vesting
schedule in effect for those option shares.
In addition, all unvested shares
outstanding under the discretionary option grant and stock issuance programs
will immediately vest, except to the extent Kana's repurchase rights with
respect to those shares are to be assigned to the successor corporation or
otherwise continued in effect.
The plan administrator will have complete
discretion to grant one or more options under the discretionary option grant
program which will become exercisable for all the option shares in the event
the optionee's service with Kana or the successor entity is terminated
(actually or constructively) within a designated period following a change in
control transaction in which those options are assumed or otherwise continued
in effect.
The vesting of outstanding shares under the stock issuance program
may also be structured to accelerate upon similar terms and conditions.

   
The plan administrator will have the discretion to structure one or more
option grants under the discretionary option grant program so that those
options will immediately vest upon a change in control, whether or not the
options are to be assumed or otherwise continued in effect.
The plan
administrator may also structure stock issuances under the stock issuance
program so that those issuances will immediately vest upon a change in control.

The shares subject to each option under the salary investment option grant,
automatic option grant and director fee option grant programs will immediately
vest upon any change in control transaction.

   
A change in control will be deemed to occur in the event (i) Kana is
acquired by merger or asset sale, (ii) there is a successful tender offer for
more than 50% of Kana's outstanding voting stock or (iii) there is a change in
the majority of the board effected through one or more contested elections for
board membership.
The merger of Kana and Broadbase is not expected to
constitute a change of control.

   
Currently outstanding options under the 1999 Stock Incentive Plan contain a
special acceleration provision pursuant to which 25% of the unvested shares
purchased or purchasable under each such option will
immediately vest in the event Kana is acquired by a merger or asset sale and
the optionee is not offered employment with the successor entity.

   
The acceleration of vesting in the event of such a change in control may be
seen as an anti-takeover provision and may have the effect of discouraging a
merger proposal, a takeover attempt or other efforts to gain control of Kana.

 
Stockholder Rights and Option Transferability

   No optionee will have any stockholder rights with respect to the option
shares until the optionee has exercised the option and paid the exercise price
for the purchased shares.
Options are generally not assignable or transferable
other than by will or the laws of inheritance following optionee's death, and
during the optionee's lifetime, the option may only be exercised by the
optionee.
However, non-statutory options may be transferred or assigned during
optionee's lifetime to one or more members of the optionee's family or to a
trust established for one or more such family members or to the optionee's
former spouse, to the extent such transfer is in connection with the optionee's
estate or pursuant to a domestic relations order.

 
Changes in Capitalization

   In the event any change is made to the outstanding shares of Kana's common
stock by reason of any recapitalization, stock dividend, stock split,
combination of shares, exchange of shares or other change in corporate
structure effected without Kana's receipt of consideration, appropriate
adjustments will be made to (i) the maximum number and/or class of securities
issuable under the 1999 Stock Incentive Plan, (ii) the maximum number and/or
class of securities for which any one person may be granted stock options,
separately exercisable stock appreciation rights and direct stock issuances
under the 1999 Stock Incentive Plan per calendar year, (iii) the number and/or
class of securities for which grants are subsequently to be made under the
automatic option grant program to new and continuing non-employee board
members, (iv) the number and/or class of securities and the exercise price per
share in effect under each outstanding option, (v) the number and/or class of
securities and the exercise price per share in effect under each outstanding
option transferred from the 1997 plan to the 1999 Stock Incentive Plan and (vi)
the maximum number and/or class of securities by which the share reserve under
the 1999 Stock Incentive Plan is to increase automatically each year.
Such
adjustments will be designed to preclude any dilution or enlargement of
benefits under the 1999 Stock Incentive Plan or the outstanding options
thereunder.

 
Financial Assistance

   The plan administrator may institute a loan program to assist one or more
participants in financing the exercise of outstanding options under the
discretionary option grant program or the purchase of shares under the stock
issuance program through full-recourse interest-bearing promissory notes.

However, the maximum amount of financing provided any participant may not
exceed the cash consideration payable for the issued shares plus all applicable
taxes incurred in connection with the acquisition of those shares.

 
Special Tax Election

   The plan administrator may provide one or more holders of options or
unvested share issuances under the Stock Incentive Plan with the right to have
Kana withhold a portion of the shares otherwise issuable to these individuals
in satisfaction of the withholding taxes to which these individuals become
subject in connection with the exercise of those options or the vesting of
those shares.
Alternatively, the plan administrator may allow these individuals
to deliver previously acquired shares of common stock in payment of such
withholding tax liability.

 
Amendment and Termination

   The board may amend or modify the 1999 Stock Incentive Plan at any time,
subject to any required stockholder approval pursuant to applicable laws and
regulations.
Unless sooner terminated by the board, the Stock Incentive Plan
will terminate on the earliest of (i) June 30, 2009, (ii) the date on which all
shares available for issuance under the 1999 Stock Incentive Plan have been
issued as fully-vested shares or (iii) the termination of all outstanding
options in connection with changes in control or ownership.

 
Federal Income Tax Consequences

  Option Grants

   Options granted under the 1999 Stock Incentive Plan may be either incentive
stock options which satisfy the requirements of Section 422 of the Internal
Revenue Code or non-statutory options which are not intended to meet such
requirements.
The Federal income tax treatment for the two types of options
differs as follows:

   Incentive Options.
No taxable income is recognized by the optionee at the
time of the option grant, and no taxable income is generally recognized at the
time the option is exercised.
The optionee will, however, recognize taxable
income in the year in which the purchased shares are sold or otherwise made the
subject of a taxable disposition.
For Federal tax purposes, dispositions are
divided into two categories: (i) qualifying and (ii) disqualifying.
A
qualifying disposition occurs if the sale or other disposition is made more
than 2 years

after the date the option for the shares involved in such sale or disposition
is granted and more than 1 year after the date the option is exercised for
those shares.
If those two requirements are satisfied at the time of the sale
or disposition, then a disqualifying disposition will result.

   
Upon a qualifying disposition, the optionee will recognize long-term capital
gain in an amount equal to the excess of (i) the amount realized upon the sale
or other disposition of the purchased shares over (ii) the exercise price paid
for the shares.
If there is a disqualifying disposition of the shares, then the
excess of (i) the fair market value of those shares on the exercise date over
(ii) the exercise price paid for the shares will be taxable as ordinary income
to the optionee.
Any additional gain or loss recognized upon the disposition
will be recognized as a capital gain or loss by the optionee.

   
If the optionee makes a disqualifying disposition of the purchased shares,
then Kana will be entitled to an income tax deduction, for the taxable year in
which such disposition occurs, equal to the excess of (i) the fair market value
of such shares on the option exercise date over (ii) the exercise price paid
for the shares.
If the optionee makes a qualifying disposition, then Kana will
not be entitled to any income tax deduction.

   
Non-Statutory Options.
No taxable income is recognized by an optionee upon
the grant of a non-statutory option.
The optionee will in general recognize
ordinary income, in the year in which the option is exercised, equal to the
excess of the fair market value of the purchased shares on the exercise date
over the exercise price paid for the shares, and the optionee will be required
to satisfy the tax withholding requirements applicable to such income.

   
If the shares acquired upon exercise of the non-statutory option are
unvested and subject to repurchase by Kana in the event of the optionee's
termination of service prior to vesting in those shares, then the optionee will
not recognize any taxable income at the time of exercise but will have to
report as ordinary income, as and when Kana's repurchase right lapses, an
amount equal to the excess of (i) the fair market value of the shares on the
date the repurchase right lapses over (ii) the exercise price paid for the
shares.
The optionee may, however, elect under Section 83(b) of the Internal
Revenue Code to include as ordinary income in the year of exercise of the
option an amount equal to the excess of (i) the fair market value of the
purchased shares on the exercise date over (ii) the exercise price paid for
such shares.
If the Section 83(b) election is made, the optionee will not
recognize any additional income as and when the repurchase right lapses.

   
Kana will be entitled to an income tax deduction equal to the amount of
ordinary income recognized by the optionee with respect to the exercised non-
statutory option.
The deduction will in general be allowed for Kana's taxable
year in which ordinary income is recognized by the optionee.

 
Stock Appreciation Rights

   No taxable income is recognized upon receipt of a stock appreciation right.

The holder will recognize ordinary income, in the year in which the stock
appreciation right is exercised, in an amount equal to the excess of the fair
market value of the underlying shares of common stock on the exercise date over
the base price in effect for the exercised right, and the holder will be
required to satisfy the tax withholding requirements applicable to such income.

   
Kana will be entitled to an income tax deduction equal to the amount of
ordinary income recognized by the holder in connection with the exercise of the
stock appreciation right.
The deduction will be allowed for Kana's taxable year
in which ordinary income is recognized.

 
Direct Stock Issuances

   The tax principles applicable to direct stock issuances under the 1999 Stock
Incentive Plan will be substantially the same as those summarized above for the
exercise of non-statutory option grants.

 
Deductibility of Executive Compensation

   Kana anticipates that any compensation deemed paid by it in connection with
the disqualifying disposition of incentive stock option shares or the exercise
of non-statutory options with exercise prices equal to the fair market value of
the option shares on the grant date will qualify as performance-based
compensation for purposes of Code Section 162(m) and will not have to be taken
into account for purposes of the $1 million limitation per covered individual
on the deductibility of the compensation paid to certain of Kana's executive
officers.
Accordingly, all compensation deemed paid with respect to those
options will remain deductible by Kana without limitation under Code Section
162(m).
However, any compensation deemed paid by Kana in connection with the
exercise of options granted to those executive officers with a below-market
exercise price will not qualify as performance-based compensation and will be
subject to the $1 million per person limitation on the deductibility of the
compensation paid to those officers.

 
Accounting Treatment

   Option grants under the discretionary option grant and automatic option
grant programs with exercise prices equal to the fair market value of the
option shares on the grant date will not result in any direct charge to Kana's
reported earnings.
However, the fair value of those options is required to be
disclosed in the notes to Kana's financial statements, and Kana must also
disclose, in footnotes to its financial statements, the pro-forma impact those
options would have upon its reported earnings were the fair value of those
options at the time of grant treated as a compensation expense.
In addition,
the number of outstanding options may be a factor in determining Kana's
earnings per share on a fully-diluted basis.

   
Option grants or stock issuances made under the 1999 Stock Incentive Plan
with exercise or issue prices less than the fair market value of the shares on
the grant or issue date will result in compensation expense to Kana in an
amount equal to the excess of the fair market value over the exercise or issue
price.
The expense must be amortized against Kana's earnings over the period
that the option shares or issued shares are to vest.
Option grants made to non-
employee consultants (but not non-employee board members) will result in a
direct charge to Kana's reported earnings based upon the fair value of the
option measured initially as of the grant date and then subsequently on the
vesting date of each installment of the underlying option shares.
The charge
will accordingly include the appreciation in the value of the option shares
over the period between the grant date of the option and the vesting date of
each installment of the option shares.

   
In addition, any options which are repriced under the 1999 Stock Incentive
Plan will also trigger a direct charge to Kana's reported earnings measured by
the appreciation in the value of the underlying shares between the grant of the
repriced option and the date the repriced option is exercised for those shares
or otherwise terminates unexercised.

   
Should one or more individuals be granted tandem stock appreciation rights
under the 1999 Stock Incentive Plan, then these rights would result in a
compensation expense to be charged against Kana's reported earnings.

Accordingly, at the end of each fiscal quarter, the amount (if any) by which
the fair market value of the shares of common stock subject to these
outstanding stock appreciation rights has increased from the prior quarter-end
would be accrued as compensation expense, to the extent the fair market value
is in excess of the aggregate exercise price in effect for those rights.

 
Vote Required

   The affirmative vote of at least a majority of the shares of common stock
present in person or by proxy at the annual meeting and entitled to vote is
required for approval of the proposed amendment to the 1999 Stock Incentive
Plan.
Should such stockholder approval not be obtained, then the 15,000,000
shares increase to the share reserve and the increase in the limit on the
annual automatic share reserve increase to 10,000,000 shares under the 1999
plan will not be implemented.
The 1999 plan will, however, continue in effect,
and option grants and direct stock issuances may continue to be made under the
1999 plan until all the shares of common

stock available for issuance under the 1999 plan, as in effect prior to the
share increase which is the subject of this proposal, have been issued pursuant
to option grants and direct stock issuances.

 
Recommendation of the Board of Directors

   KANA'S BOARD OF DIRECTORS HAS DETERMINED THAT THIS PROPOSAL IS IN THE BEST
INTERESTS OF THE COMPANY AND ITS STOCKHOLDERS AND RECOMMENDS A VOTE FOR
APPROVAL OF THE AMENDMENT OF KANA'S 1999 STOCK INCENTIVE PLAN.


Proposal to Amend and Restate Kana's 1999 Employee Stock Purchase Plan

 Introduction

   Kana's stockholders are being asked to approve an amendment and restatement
of Kana's 1999 Employee Stock Purchase Plan which will effect the following
changes: (i) increase the number of shares of common stock issuable under the
term of the 1999 Employee Stock Purchase Plan by an additional 10,000,000
shares of common stock, from 2,122,507 shares to 12,122,507 shares, (ii)
increase the limit on the maximum number of shares by which the share reserve
under the 1999 Employee Stock Purchase Plan may automatically increase each
calendar year from 666,666 shares to 4,000,000 shares, effective for all
calendar years after the 2001 calendar year, (iii) provide the plan
administrator with the authority to implement a series of overlapping twenty-
four (24)-month offering periods beginning at semi-annual intervals each year,
with the purchases to occur at semi-annual intervals within each such offering
period, (iv) increase the limit on the maximum number of shares of common stock
purchasable in total by all participants on any one purchase date from 250,000
shares to 1,000,000 shares or such other limit as the plan administrator deems
advisable, and (v) revise certain provisions of the plan document in order to
facilitate the administration of the 1999 Employee Stock Purchase Plan.

   
The purpose of the amendment and restatement is to ensure that Kana will
continue to have a sufficient reserve of common stock available under the 1999
Employee Stock Purchase Plan to provide eligible employees of Kana and its
participating affiliates (whether now existing or subsequently established)
with the opportunity to purchase shares of common stock at semi-annual
intervals through their accumulated periodic payroll deductions.

   
The 1999 Employee Stock Purchase Plan was adopted by the board on July 7,
1999 and approved by the Kana stockholders on August 16, 1999.
The 1999
Employee Stock Purchase Plan became effective on September 21, 1999, in
connection with the initial public offering of Kana's common stock.
The
amendment and restatement of the 1999 Employee Stock Purchase Plan which is the
subject of this proposal was adopted by the Kana Board of Directors on
April 26, 2001, subject to the approval of the Kana stockholders at the annual
meeting.

   
The terms and provisions of the amended and restated 1999 Employee Stock
Purchase Plan are summarized below.
This summary, however, does not purport to
be a complete description of the 1999 Employee Stock Purchase Plan.
A copy of
the 1999 Employee Stock Purchase Plan is attached to this joint proxy
statement/prospectus as Appendix XI.

   
All share numbers in this proposal reflect the two-for-one split of the
common stock which was effected on February 22, 2000 through the payment of a
dividend of one additional share of common stock for every share of common
stock outstanding on January 28, 2000.

 
Description of the Purchase Plan

  Administration

   The 1999 Employee Stock Purchase Plan is administered by the compensation
committee of the board.
Such committee, as plan administrator, has full
authority to adopt administrative rules and procedures and to interpret the
provisions of the 1999 Employee Stock Purchase Plan.

 
Securities Subject to the Purchase Plan

   The maximum number of shares of common stock currently reserved for issuance
over the term of the 1999 Employee Stock Purchase Plan is currently limited to
2,122,507 shares.
As of April 20, 2001, 492,539 shares of common stock have
been issued under the 1999 Employee Stock Purchase Plan, 1,630,148 shares were
available for future issuance under the 1999 Employee Stock Purchase Plan.
If
this Proposal is approved at the annual meeting, then the total number of
shares available for issuance over the term of the plan will be increased to
12,122,507 shares.

   
In addition, the share reserve under the 1999 Employee Stock Purchase Plan
will automatically increase on the first trading day of January each calendar
year by an amount equal to 0.75% of the total number of shares of common stock
outstanding on the last trading day of December in the immediately preceding
calendar year, but in no event will any such annual increase exceed 666,666
shares.
However, should the Kana stockholders approve this proposal, then the
limit on the maximum number of shares by which the share reserve under the 1999
Employee Stock Purchase Plan may automatically increase each year will increase
from 666,666 shares to 4,000,000 shares, effective for all calendar years after
2001.

   
The shares issuable under the 1999 Employee Stock Purchase Plan may be made
available from authorized but unissued shares of Kana's common stock or from
shares of common stock repurchased by Kana, including shares repurchased on the
open market.

   
In the event that any change is made to the outstanding common stock
(whether by reason of any recapitalization, stock dividend, stock split,
exchange or combination of shares or other change affecting the outstanding
common stock as a class without Kana's receipt of consideration), appropriate
adjustments will be made to (i) the maximum number and class of securities
issuable under the 1999 Employee Stock Purchase Plan, (ii) the maximum number
and class of securities by which the share reserve is to increase automatically
each year, (iii) the maximum number and class of securities purchasable per
participant on any one semi-annual purchase date, (iv) the maximum number and
class of securities purchasable in total by all participants on any one
purchase date and (v) the number and class of securities and the price per
share in effect under each outstanding purchase right.
Such adjustments will be
designed to preclude any dilution or enlargement of benefits under the 1999
Employee Stock Purchase Plan or the outstanding purchase rights thereunder.

 
Offering Periods

   Shares of common stock are currently offered under the 1999 Employee Stock
Purchase Plan through a series of successive offering periods, each with a
maximum duration of 24 months.
However, the initial offering period began on
September 21, 1999 and is scheduled to end on the last business day in October
2001.
Should the fair market value per share of common stock on any remaining
purchase date within that offering period (April 30, 2001 or October 31, 2001)
be less than the fair market value per share on the start date of the two-year
offering period, then that offering period will automatically terminate, and a
new two-year offering period will begin on the next business day, with all
participants in the terminated offering to be automatically transferred to the
new offering period.

   
If stockholder approval of this proposal is obtained, then the plan
administrator will have the authority to provide for a series of overlapping
offering periods under the 1999 Employee Stock Purchase Plan, each with a
maximum duration of 24 months.
Such offering periods would begin on the first
business day of May and on the first business day of November each year.

Accordingly, we could have two separate offering periods in each calendar year
the 1999 Employee Stock Purchase Plan remains in effect.
However, no
overlapping offering periods are expected to begin prior to November 1, 2001.

   
Each offering period is expected to consist of a series of one or more
successive purchase intervals.
Purchase intervals are expected to run from the
first business day in May to the last business day in October each year and
from the first business day in November each year to the last business day in
April in the immediately succeeding year.

 
Automatic Restart Provisions

   
If the fair market value per share of common stock on any semi-annual
purchase date within a particular offering period is less than the fair market
value per share of common stock on the start date of that offering period, then
the participants in that offering period will automatically be transferred from
that offering period after the semi-annual purchase of shares on their behalf
and enrolled in the new offering period which begins on the next business day
following such purchase date.

 
Eligibility and Participation

   Any individual who is employed on a basis under which he or she is regularly
expected to work for more than 20 hours per week for more than five months per
calendar year in the employ of Kana or any participating parent or subsidiary
corporation (including any corporation which subsequently becomes such at any
time during the term of the 1999 Employee Stock Purchase Plan) is eligible to
participate in the 1999 Employee Stock Purchase Plan.

   
An individual who is an eligible employee on the start date of any offering
period may join that offering period at that time or on any other designated
entry date for that offering period.
An individual who becomes an eligible
employee after the start date of an offering period may join that offering
period on any designated entry date for that offering period.
However, an
eligible employee may not participate in more than one offering period at a
time.

   
As of April 20, 2001, approximately 580 employees, including five executive
officers, were eligible to participate in the 1999 Employee Stock Purchase
Plan.

 
Purchase Price

   The purchase price of the common stock purchased on behalf of each
participant in the 1999 Employee Stock Purchase Plan on each semi-annual
purchase date will be equal to 85% of the lower of (i) the fair market value
per share of common stock on the start date of the offering period in which the
participant is enrolled or (ii) the fair market value on the semi-annual
purchase date.

   
The fair market value per share of common stock on any particular date under
the 1999 Employee Stock Purchase Plan will be deemed to be equal to the closing
selling price per share on such date on the Nasdaq National Market.
On April
12, 2001, the closing selling price per share of common stock on the Nasdaq
National Market was $1.32.
For the current offering period which began on
September 21, 1999 in connection with the initial public offering of the common
stock, the fair market value per share was deemed to be $7.50 (post-split), the
price per share at which the common stock was sold pursuant to the underwriting
agreement for that offering.

 
Payroll Deductions and Stock Purchases

   Each participant may authorize periodic payroll deductions in any multiple
of 1% up to a maximum of 15% of his or her total cash compensation (base salary
plus bonus, overtime and commissions) to be applied to the acquisition of
common stock at semi-annual intervals.
Accordingly, on each semi-annual
purchase date (the last business day in April and October each year), the
accumulated payroll deductions of each participant will automatically be
applied to the purchase of whole shares of common stock at the purchase price
in effect for the participant for that purchase date.

 
Special Limitations

   The 1999 Employee Stock Purchase Plan imposes certain limitations upon a
participant's rights to acquire common stock, including the following
limitations:

  .
Purchase rights granted to a participant may not permit such individual
    to purchase more than $25,000 worth of common stock (valued at the time
    each purchase right is granted) for each calendar year those purchase
    rights are outstanding at any time.

  .
Purchase rights may not be granted to any individual if such individual
    would, immediately after the grant, own or hold outstanding options or
    other rights to purchase, stock possessing 5% or more of the total
    combined voting power or value of all classes of stock of Kana or any of
    its affiliates.

  .
No participant may purchase more than 1,500 shares of common stock on any
    one purchase date.

  .
The maximum number of shares of common stock purchasable in total by all
    participants on any one purchase date within the current offering period
    which began on September 21, 1999 is limited to 250,000 shares for each
    offering period commencing prior to the approval of the share increase
    proposal and will be increased to 1,000,000 shares or such other limit as
    may be determined by the plan administrator for each purchase date within
    each subsequent offering period.

   
The plan administrator will have the discretionary authority to increase or
decrease the per participant and total participant share limitations prior to
the start date of any new offering period under the 1999 Employee Stock
Purchase Plan.
