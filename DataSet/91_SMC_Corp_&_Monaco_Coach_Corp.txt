Parent intends to repay borrowings under the Credit Facility from working capital and funds provided by future operations. 

11.  Contacts and Transactions with the Company; Background of the Offer  

    On February 16, 2001, the Company issued a press release disclosing that the Company had retained McDonald as its financial advisor to explore strategic
alternatives for the Company. 

    
On
March 13, 2001, McDonald contacted Parent to determine whether Parent might be interested in pursuing an acquisition of or other potential business combination with the
Company.
Parent indicated that it might be interested in such a transaction and, on March 21, 2001, Parent and McDonald, acting on behalf of itself and as agent for the Company, entered into a
confidentiality agreement concerning information to be provided to Parent by McDonald and the Company.
After signing the confidentiality agreement on March 26, 2001, McDonald provided general
information and financial information concerning the Company to Parent for the purposes of determining whether it might be interested in
pursuing a transaction with the Company.
Parent retained Salomon Smith Barney as its exclusive financial advisor in connection with a possible transaction involving the Company. 

    
Following
review of the information provided to it, and review of public information about the Company, on April 27, 2001 Parent provided to Mathew M. Perlot, Chairman
of the Company, in care of McDonald, a non-binding indication of interest in acquiring the Company subject, among other things, to satisfactory completion of a due diligence process and execution of a
definitive agreement.
McDonald responded by indicating that the Company was interested in having further discussions with Parent. 

    
Senior
management of Parent and the Company, together with representatives of McDonald and Salomon Smith Barney, Stoel Rives LLP ("Stoel Rives"), legal advisors to the Company,
PricewaterhouseCoopers, independent auditors of Parent, and Ball Janik LLP, legal advisors to Mr. Perlot and Curtis W. Lawler, Chief Executive Officer of the Company, attended a meeting
on May 10, 2001 at the offices of Stoel Rives in Portland, Oregon.
The parties discussed a potential acquisition of the Company by Parent and the form such an acquisition might take, which
discussion primarily focused on a potential purchase of all of the equity interest in the Company by Parent.
The 

Company indicated at that meeting that an acquisition by Parent of the assets of the Company would not be acceptable.
At the meeting, it was agreed that Parent would be given further access to the
Company's business information and the due diligence process began immediately. 

    
Also
on May 10, 2001, management of Parent and Parent's representatives were granted access to a data room which contained due diligence information about the Company. 

    
At
a regular meeting of Parent's Board of Directors held on May 17, 2001, a possible transaction with the Company was discussed.
Messrs. Kay L. Toolson, Chairman and
Chief Executive Officer, John W. Nepute, President, Richard E. Bond, Senior Vice President, Secretary and Chief Administrative Officer, and P. Martin Daley, Vice President and
Chief Financial Officer of Parent, attended the meeting.
Management discussed the findings of its due diligence to date and discussion ensued regarding the potential merits and risks of such a
transaction.
The Board affirmed the authority of Parent's officers to proceed with its due diligence process and authorized management to proceed with its investigation of a possible business
transaction with the Company and negotiation of the terms of such a transaction.
The Board of Directors indicated to management that the transaction should be structured as a cash tender offer. 

    
During
the latter half of May and the first half of June, Parent continued its due diligence investigation of the Company, including visits to the Company's manufacturing facilities.

On May 16, 2001, Stoel Rives sent an initial draft merger agreement to Parent and Wilson Sonsini Goodrich & Rosati
("WSGR"), counsel to Parent.
On June 13, 2001, WSGR sent a revised version of the draft merger agreement to Stoel Rives reflecting comments by WSGR and Parent. 

    
Following
plant visits and evaluation of the items presented in the data room and throughout the diligence process, and following receipt of a revised version of the draft merger
agreement, on June 18, 2001, Parent's Board of Directors held a special telephonic meeting.
Messrs. Toolson, Nepute, Bond and Daley, as well as representatives of WSGR, participated in the
telephone meeting.
Management presented the results of the due diligence investigation of the Company.
Discussion ensued regarding the benefits and risks of a potential business combination with the
Company and potential valuations of the Company.
At the conclusion of the meeting, Parent's Board of Directors authorized Parent and its officers to make an offer to acquire the Company in the form of
a cash tender offer up to a given per share price ceiling, to negotiate, execute and deliver a definitive acquisition agreement, and to that end to make all related filings with the Commission and
take all other appropriate actions in furtherance of the foregoing. 

    
On
June 18, pursuant to the Board's authorization and at Parent's direction, Salomon Smith Barney conveyed an offer to the Company.
On June 19, Mr. Toolson subsequently
held a telephone conversation with Mr. Perlot to discuss Parent's offer.
After some price negotiation, and upon Mr. Perlot's agreement to reduce certain retirement payments which would
have been due to him and to Mr. Lawler from the Company pursuant to certain retirement agreements between the Company and each of Mr. Perlot and Mr. Lawler, Mr. Toolson and Mr.
Perlot ultimately agreed on an acquisition price of $3.70 per Share for all outstanding shares of the Company in the form of a cash tender offer and back end merger, subject to approval by the
Company's Board of Directors. 

    
Legal
advisors to each of the Company and Parent negotiated the terms of the Merger Agreement throughout the week of June 18. 

    
On
June 21, 2001, the Company's Board of Directors held a meeting at which the Company's legal advisors and management updated the Company's Board of Directors on the status of
negotiations with Parent and informed the Board of Directors that nearly all substantive issues had been resolved, the Company's legal advisors made a presentation to the Board of Directors regarding
the fiduciary duties of the Board of Directors and reviewed with the Board of Directors the terms of the proposed merger agreement with Parent and the regulatory filings and approvals that would be
required in connection 

with the proposed transaction, and McDonald made a financial presentation to the Board of Directors and rendered its written opinion to the Board of Directors to the effect that, as of that date, the
per Share consideration was fair to the Company shareholders from a financial point of view.
The Board of Directors adjourned its meeting and agreed to meet again on June 22, 2001. 

    
The
Company's Board of Directors met again on June 22, 2001.
The Company's legal advisors and management updated the Board of Directors on the status of negotiations with Parent and
informed the Board of Directors that all substantive issues had been resolved.
Afterwards, the Board of Directors by a unanimous vote of the directors present determined the Merger was fair to, and in
the best interests of, the Company and its shareholders and approved the terms of the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated by the agreement, and authorized the execution of the Merger
Agreement and recommended that Company shareholders tender all their shares in the Offer. 

    
On
June 22, 2001, the last trading day before the Merger Agreement was signed, the closing price of Company Common Stock was $3.00 per Share. 

    
On
Saturday, June 23, 2001, Parent and the Company executed the Merger Agreement.
Mr. Perlot and Mr. Lawler, who together own approximately 70% of the Company's outstanding
Common Stock, executed and delivered the Shareholder's Agreements agreeing to tender their Shares in the Offer.
The agreement was announced in separate press releases issued by each of Parent and the
Company prior to the open of the stock exchanges on Monday, June 25, 2001. 

    
During
the Offer, Parent intends to have ongoing contacts and negotiations with the Company and its directors, officers and shareholders.
Other than as to Mr. Richard A.
Rouse, a director of Parent, who bought 5,000 Shares of the Company on October 21, 1998 at $5.00 per Share and sold all those Shares at a loss on June 15, 2000 for $3.1187 per Share, and
as to Mr. Kay L. Toolson, the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Parent, who bought 10,000 Shares of the Company on dates ranging from October 16 to October 20, 1998
at an average purchase price of $4.99 per Share and sold all those Shares, along with an additional 100 Shares previously acquired by Mr. Toolson in 1995, at a loss on July 28, 2000 for
$3.25 per Share, to the knowledge of Parent and Purchaser, there have not been any transactions during the past two years between Parent or Purchaser or their executive officers or directors on the
one hand and the Company or any of its affiliates or any executive officer or director of the Company on the other hand that would be required to be disclosed pursuant to the rules and regulations of
the Commission. 


12.  
Purpose of the Offer; the Merger Agreement; Plans for the Company  

Purpose  

    The purpose of the Offer and Merger is to enable Parent to acquire the entire equity interest in, and thus control of, the Company.
The Offer, as the first
step in the acquisition of the Company, is intended to facilitate the acquisition of all the outstanding Shares or, if less, all Shares tendered and not withdrawn from the Offer, subject to the
conditions set forth above.
The purpose of the Merger is to acquire any and all outstanding Shares not tendered and purchased pursuant to the Offer. 


Plans for the Company  

    If the Minimum Condition and the other conditions to the Offer have been satisfied and Purchaser purchases all shares tendered pursuant to the Offer, Parent
intends and will have the right to designate representatives to the Company's Board of Directors who will constitute a majority thereof and therefore control the Company.
Following completion of the
Offer and the Merger, Parent intends to integrate the Company's operations with those of Parent under the direction of Parent's management.
Parent's principal reason for acquiring the Company is to
complement Parent's operations and increase Parent's share of the Class A motor coach market.
Parent intends to continue to review the Company 

and its assets, corporate structure, dividend policy, capitalization, operations, properties, policies, management and personnel and to consider, subject to the terms of the Merger Agreement, what, if
any, changes would be desirable in light of the circumstances then existing, and reserves the right to take such actions or effect such changes as it deems desirable. 


The Merger Agreement  

    The Merger Agreement provides that, following the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions described below under "Conditions to the Merger", Purchaser will be
merged with and into the Company, with the Company being the surviving corporation, and each issued Share (other than Shares owned by Parent, Purchaser, or the Company, or by a subsidiary of Parent,
Purchaser or the Company, or by those shareholders, if any, who are entitled to and who properly exercise appraisal rights under Oregon law) will be converted into the right to receive the price per
Share paid pursuant to the Offer in cash, without interest thereon. 

    
Vote Required to Approve Merger.
  
The Oregon Business Corporation Act (the "OBCA") requires that, unless Purchaser has
acquired 90% or more of the Shares pursuant to the Offer, the Merger must be approved by the holders of a majority of the shares of the Company's stock outstanding and entitled to vote on the
question.
Other than the Shares, there are no shares of any class of the Company's stock outstanding and the Company's Restated Articles of Incorporation do not contain any provision that would reduce
the vote required by the Company's shareholders for approval of the Merger.
Consequently, the Company will call and hold a meeting of its shareholders promptly following the consummation of the Offer
for the purposes of voting upon the approval of the Merger.
At such meeting all Shares then owned by Parent or Purchaser will be voted in favor of the approval of the Merger.
If Purchaser
acquires—through the Offer, the Merger Agreement or otherwise—voting power with respect to a majority of the outstanding Shares (which would be the case if the Minimum
Condition (as defined on the cover of this Offer to Purchase) were satisfied and Purchaser were to accept for payment Shares tendered pursuant to the Offer), it would have sufficient voting power to
effect the Merger without the affirmative vote of any other shareholder of the Company.
The Company's
Chairman of the Board of Directors, Mathew M. Perlot, and its Chief Executive Officer, Curtis W. Lawler, who together hold approximately 70% of the Shares outstanding on June 23, 2001, have
agreed with Parent to tender all of their shares in the tender Offer. 

    
Conditions to the Merger.
  
The Merger Agreement provides that the respective obligations of each party to effect the
Merger are subject to the satisfaction or waiver of certain conditions, including the following: (a) the Offer shall have been completed; (b) if required (i.e. if, following completion
of the Offer Purchaser owns less than 90% of the Shares), the Merger shall have been approved by a majority of the shareholders of the Company in accordance with the OBCA (the "Company Shareholders
Approval") prior to the effective time of the Merger (the "Effective Time"); and (c) no order, statute, rule, regulation, executive order, stay, decree, judgment or injunction shall have been
enacted, entered, promulgated or enforced by any court or other any nation or government, any state or other political subdivision thereof or any entity, authority or body exercising executive,
legislative, judicial or regulatory functions of or pertaining to government, including, without limitation, any governmental or regulatory authority, agency, department, board, commission or
instrumentality, any court, tribunal or arbitrator and any self-regulatory organization (a "Governmental Authority") which prohibits or prevents the completion of the Merger (collectively,
"Restraints") which has not been vacated, dismissed or withdrawn prior to the Effective Time. 

    
Termination of the Merger Agreement.
  
The Merger Agreement may be terminated, and the Offer and the Merger may be
abandoned, at any time prior to the Effective Time of the Merger: 

    (a) by
mutual written consent of Parent and the Company (

the Company's Board of Directors of the directors designated by Parent (the "Board Designation Date"), the unanimous vote of the Independent Directors (as defined under "Board of Directors") shall
also be required); 

    (b) by
either Parent or the Company if any Governmental Authority shall have issued an order, decree or ruling or taken any other action permanently enjoining,
restraining or otherwise prohibiting the completion of the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement and such order, decree or ruling or other action shall have become final and nonappealable; 

    (c) by
Parent if: 

     (i) the
Company shall have breached or failed to perform in any material respect any of its covenants or other agreements contained in the Merger Agreement, which
breach or failure to perform is incapable of being cured or has not been cured within 5 days after the giving of written notice thereof to the Company (but not later than the expiration of the
period, if any, by which the Offer is extended by Purchaser); 

    (ii) any
representation or warranty of the Company shall not have been true and correct when made (without for this purpose giving effect to qualifications of
materiality contained in such representation and warranty), if such failure to be true and correct, individually or in the aggregate, would reasonably be expected to have a "Material Adverse Effect",
which is defined to mean any change, effect or circumstance that, individually or when taken together with all other similar changes, effects or circumstances that have occurred during the period
relevant to the determination of such Material Adverse Effect, is or is reasonably likely to be materially adverse to the business, assets (including intangible assets), financial condition or results
of operations of the Company and any Company's subsidiaries or Parent and its subsidiaries, as the case may be, in each case taken as a whole; 
provided,
however
, that effects of changes that arise from (i) any changes in economic, regulatory, or political conditions generally, (which changes do not disproportionately
affect the Company in a material way), (ii) the United States securities markets, (iii) compliance with the Merger Agreement or pendency or completion of the transactions contemplated by
the Merger Agreement and (iv) the effect of the public announcement of the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, including any effect on customers or employees of the Company,
shall be excluded from the definition of "Material Adverse
Effect" and from any determination as to whether a Material Adverse Effect has occurred or may occur; or 

    (iii) any
representation or warranty of the Company shall cease to be true and correct at any later date (without for this purpose giving effect to qualifications of
materiality contained in such representation and warranty) as if made on such date (other than representations and warranties made as of a specified date) other than as a result of a breach or failure
to perform by the Company of any of its covenants or agreements under the Merger Agreement if such failure to be true and correct, individually or in the aggregate, would reasonably be expected to
have a Material Adverse Effect; 
provided, however
, that such representation or warranty is incapable of being cured or has not been cured within
5 days after the giving of written notice thereof to the Company (but not later than the expiration of the period, if any, by which the Offer is extended by Purchaser); 

provided, however
, that the
right to terminate the Merger Agreement pursuant to this subsection (c) shall not be available to Parent if Purchaser
or any other affiliate of Parent shall acquire Shares pursuant to the Offer; 

    (d) by
Parent if, whether or not permitted to do so by the Merger Agreement, (i) the Board of Directors of the Company or any committee thereof shall have
withdrawn or modified in a 

manner adverse to Parent or Purchaser its approval or recommendation of the Offer, the Merger Agreement, the Merger or any of the transactions contemplated by the foregoing; (ii) the Board of
Directors of the Company or any committee thereof shall have approved or recommended to the shareholders of the Company any Company Takeover Proposal (as defined below) or Alternative Transaction (as
defined below); (iii) the Board of Directors of the Company or any committee thereof shall have approved or recommended that the shareholders of the Company tender their Common Shares in any
tender or exchange offer that is an Alternative Transaction; (iv) the Board of Directors of the Company or any committee thereof shall have taken any position or made any disclosures to the
Company's shareholders permitted pursuant to the section hereof entitled "No Solicitation" below which has the effect of any of the foregoing; or (v) the Board of Directors of the Company or
any committee thereof shall have resolved to take any of the foregoing actions; 

    (e) by
either Parent or the Company if, as the result of the failure of the Minimum Condition or any of the other conditions to the Offer, the Offer shall have
terminated or expired in accordance with its terms without Purchaser having purchased any Shares pursuant to the Offer, 
provided that
 if the failure to
satisfy any of the conditions to the Offer shall be a basis for termination of the Merger Agreement under any other clause of this section entitled "Termination of the Merger Agreement", a termination
pursuant to this clause (e) shall be deemed a termination under such other clause; 

    (f)  by
either Parent or the Company if the Offer shall not have been completed on or before August 11, 2001, 
provided
that
 the right to terminate the Merger Agreement pursuant to this clause (f) shall not be available to any party whose failure to perform any of its obligations under
the Merger Agreement results in the failure of the Offer to be completed by such time; 

    (g) by
the Company, if Parent or Purchaser shall have breached or failed to perform in any material respect any of its representations, warranties, covenants or other
agreements contained in the Merger Agreement, which breach or failure to perform is incapable of being cured or has not been cured within 5 days after the giving of written notice thereof to
Parent; or 

    (h) by
the Company in order to accept a Superior Proposal (as defined below) by a third party, provided (i) the Company has given Parent five business days
advance notice of the Company's intention to accept such Superior Proposal, (ii) the Company shall in fact accept such third party Superior Proposal, (iii) the Company shall have paid
the fee and expenses contemplated by the Merger Agreement, and (iv) the Company shall have complied in all respects with the provisions of the section hereof entitled "No Solicitation" below. 

        
No Solicitation.
  
The Merger Agreement provides that: 

    (a) The
Company shall not, directly or indirectly, through any officer, director, employee, representative or agent of the Company or any of the Company's subsidiaries,
solicit or encourage the initiation of (including by way of furnishing information) any inquiries or proposals regarding any merger, sale of assets, sale of shares of capital stock (including without
limitation by way of a tender offer) or similar transactions involving the Company or any Company's subsidiaries that if completed would constitute an Alternative Transaction (as defined below) (any
of the foregoing inquiries or proposals being referred to herein as a "Company Takeover Proposal").
Nothing contained in the Merger Agreement shall prevent the Board of Directors of the Company from
(i) furnishing information to a third party which has made a bona fide Company Takeover Proposal that is a Superior Proposal (as defined below) not solicited in violation of the Merger
Agreement, provided that such third party has executed an agreement with confidentiality provisions substantially similar to those then in effect between the Company and Parent (the "Confidentiality
Agreement") or (ii) subject to compliance with the other terms of this section entitled "No Solicitation", considering and negotiating a bona fide Company Takeover Proposal that is a Superior
Proposal not solicited in violation of the Merger Agreement.
For purposes of the Merger 

Agreement, a "Superior Proposal" means any proposal made by a party to acquire, directly or indirectly, for consideration consisting of cash and/or securities, all of the equity securities of the
Company entitled to vote generally in the election of directors or all the assets of the Company (other than a 
de minimis
 amount of assets not material
to the conduct of the Company's business), on terms which the Board of Directors of the Company reasonably believes (after due consultation with a financial advisor of nationally recognized
reputation, which may be McDonald) to be more favorable from a financial point of view to its shareholders than the Offer and the Merger taking into account at the time of determination all factors
relating to such proposed transaction deemed relevant by the Board of Directors of the Company, including, without limitation, the financing thereof, the proposed timing thereof and all other
conditions thereto and any changes to the financial terms of the Merger Agreement proposed by Parent and Purchaser.
"Alternative Transaction" means any of (i) a transaction
pursuant to which any person (or group of persons) other than Parent or its affiliates (a "Third Party") acquires or would acquire more than 20% of the outstanding shares of any class of equity
securities of the Company, whether from the Company or pursuant to a tender offer or exchange offer or otherwise, (ii) a merger or other business combination involving the Company pursuant to
which any Third Party acquires more than 20% of the outstanding equity securities of the Company or the entity surviving such merger or business combination, (iii) any transaction pursuant to
which any Third Party acquires or would acquire control of assets (including for this purpose the outstanding equity securities of Company's subsidiaries and securities of the entity surviving any
merger or business combination including any of the Company's subsidiaries) of the Company or any Company's subsidiaries having a fair market value (as determined by the Board of Directors of the
Company in good faith) equal to more than 20% of the fair market value of all the assets of the Company and the Company's subsidiaries, taken as a whole, immediately prior to such transaction, or
(iv) any other consolidation, business combination, recapitalization or similar transaction involving the Company or any of the Company's subsidiaries, other than the transactions contemplated
by the Merger Agreement; 

    (b) The
Company shall immediately notify Parent and Purchaser after receipt of any Company Takeover Proposal, or any modification of or amendment to any Company
Takeover Proposal, or any request for nonpublic information relating to the Company or any of the Company's subsidiaries in connection with a Company Takeover Proposal or for access to the properties,
books or records of the Company or any subsidiary by any person or entity that informs the Board of Directors of the Company or such subsidiary that it is considering making, or has made, a Company
Takeover Proposal.
Such notice to Parent and Purchaser shall be made orally and in writing, and shall indicate the identity of the person making the Company Takeover Proposal or intending to make the
Company Takeover Proposal or requesting non-public information or access to the books and records of the Company, the terms of any such Company Takeover Proposal or modification or
amendment to a Company Takeover Proposal, and whether the Company is providing or intends to provide the person making the Company Takeover Proposal with access to information concerning the Company
as provided in the preceding paragraph.
The Company shall also immediately notify Parent and Purchaser, orally and in writing, if it enters into negotiations concerning any Company Takeover Proposal. 

    
(c) Except
as set forth in this section entitled "No Solicitation", neither the Board of Directors of the Company nor any committee thereof shall (i) withdraw or
modify, or indicate publicly its intention to withdraw or modify, in a manner adverse to Parent, the approval or recommendation by such Board of Directors or such committee of the Offer or the Company
Proposals, (ii) approve or recommend, or indicate publicly its intention to approve or recommend, any Company Takeover Proposal or (iii) cause the Company to enter into any letter of
intent, agreement in principle, acquisition agreement or other similar agreement (each, a "Company Acquisition Agreement") related to any Company Takeover Proposal.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, in
the event that prior to the Effective Time the Board of Directors of the Company 

determines in good faith, after due consultation with outside legal counsel, that the failure to do so constitutes a breach of its fiduciary duties to the Company's shareholders under applicable law,
the Board of Directors of the Company may (subject to this and the following sentences) approve or recommend a Superior Proposal and, in connection therewith, withdraw or modify its approval or
recommendation of the Offer or the Company Proposals, but only at a time that is after the fifth
business day following Parent's receipt of written notice advising Parent that the Board of Directors of the Company has received a Superior Proposal and, in the case of any previously received
Superior Proposal that has been materially modified or amended, such modification or amendment and specifying the material terms and conditions of such Superior Proposal, modification or amendment. 

    
(d) Nothing
contained in this section entitled "No Solicitation" shall prohibit the Company from taking and disclosing to its shareholders a position contemplated by
Rule 14e-2(a) under the Exchange Act or from making any disclosure to the Company's shareholders if, in the good faith judgment of the Board of Directors of the Company, with the
advice of outside counsel, failure so to disclose could be determined to be a breach of its fiduciary duties to the Company's shareholders under applicable law; 
provided,
however
, that neither the Company nor its Board of Directors nor any committee thereof shall, except as permitted by the preceding paragraph, withdraw or modify, or indicate
publicly its intention to withdraw or modify, its position with respect to the Offer or the Company Proposals or approve or recommend, or indicate publicly its intention to approve or recommend, a
Company Takeover Proposal. 

    
Fees and Expenses; Termination Fee.
  
The Merger Agreement provides that except as set forth below, all fees and expenses
incurred in connection with the Offer, the Merger, the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement will be paid by the party incurring such fees or expenses, whether or
not the Merger is consummated. 

    
The
Company has agreed that if the Merger Agreement is terminated pursuant to 

     (i) paragraph (d)
of the section entitled "Termination of the Merger Agreement" above; 

    (ii) paragraph (h)
of the section entitled "Termination of the Merger Agreement" above; or

become publicly known or there shall be outstanding an announcement by any third party of a clearly expressed intention to make an Company Takeover Proposal (in each case whether or not conditional
and whether or not such proposal shall have been rejected by the Board of Directors of the Company) and (B) an Alternative Transaction shall be publicly announced by the Company or any third
party within 12 months following the date of such termination and such transaction shall at any time thereafter be completed on substantially the terms theretofore announced; 

    then
the Company shall pay to Parent the sum of $850,349 less any amounts paid to Parent under the following paragraph.

as practicable but in no event later than two business days following termination of the Merger Agreement in the case of
clause (i) above, upon termination of the Merger Agreement in the case of clause (ii) above and, in the case of clause (iii) above, upon completion of such Company Takeover
Proposal. 

    
The
Company has further agreed that if the Merger Agreement is terminated pursuant to paragraph (c)(i), (c)(ii), (e) or (f) of the section entitled "Termination
of the Merger Agreement" above (and, in the case of paragraph (e) or (f), only when (A) there is a failure of a condition set forth in paragraph (g) of Section 13 entitled

representations and warranties made as of the date of the Merger Agreement, or (B) there is a failure under the conditions set forth in paragraphs (h) or (j) of Section 13
entitled "Certain Conditions of the Offer" below), the Company will pay to Parent, as promptly as practicable but in no event later than two business days following termination of the Merger
Agreement, the amount of all documented and reasonable costs and expenses incurred by Parent, Purchaser and their affiliates (including but not limited to fees and expenses of counsel and accountants
and out-of-pocket expenses (but not fees) of financial advisors) in an aggregate amount not to exceed $250,000 in connection with the Merger Agreement or the transactions

than equity-based compensation) and other benefits consistent with those provided for similarly situated employees of the Company as of the date hereof; 

    (G) alter
through merger, liquidation, reorganization, restructuring or in any other fashion the corporate structure or ownership of any Company subsidiary or the

practice; 

    (K) except
to the extent necessary for the exercise of its fiduciary duties by the Board of Directors of the Company as set forth in, and consistent with the provisions

into any new Company material contract or lease; modify, amend or terminate any existing Company material contract or lease; exercise any rights or options

Company material contract or grant any consents thereunder; grant or otherwise create or consent to the creation of any lien, easement, covenant, restriction, assessment or charge affecting any owned

rights therein; commit any waste or nuisance on any such property; or make any material changes in the construction or condition of any such property; 

    (N) other
than actions permitted under the Merger Agreement, including but not limited to the section entitled "No Solicitation" above, take any action that the Company
knows at the time of taking such action would likely result in any of the conditions to the Offer set forth in Section 13 entitled "Certain Conditions of the Offer" below not to be satisfied;
or 

    (O) take,
or agree in writing or otherwise to take, any of the foregoing actions or any action which would make any of the representations or warranties of the Company
contained in the Merger Agreement untrue or incorrect in any material respect at or prior to the Effective Time. 

    
The
Company shall, and the Company shall cause each of the Company's subsidiaries to, comply with all laws and Company material contracts applicable to it or any of its properties,
assets or business and to maintain in full force and effect all the Company permits necessary for such business, except in any such case for any failure so to comply or maintain that would not
reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect. 

    
Board of Directors.
  
Promptly upon the purchase by Parent of Shares pursuant to the Offer (and provided that the Minimum
Condition has been satisfied), Parent shall be entitled to designate the number of directors, rounded up to the next whole number, on the Board of Directors of the Company as will give Parent, subject
to compliance with Section 14(f) of the Exchange Act, representation on the Board of Directors of the Company equal to at least that number of directors which equals the product of the total
number of directors on the Board of Directors of the Company (giving effect to the directors appointed or elected pursuant to this sentence and including current directors serving as officers of the
Company) multiplied by the percentage that the aggregate number of Common Shares beneficially owned by Parent or any affiliate of Parent (including for purposes of this section such Common Shares as
are accepted for payment pursuant to the Offer, but excluding Common Shares held by the Company) bears to the number of Common Shares outstanding.
At such time, if requested by Parent, the Company
will also cause each committee of the Board of Directors of the Company to include persons designated by Parent constituting the same percentage of each such committee as Parent's designees are of the
Board of Directors of the Company.
The Company shall, upon request by Parent, promptly increase the size of the Board of Directors of the Company or exercise reasonable best efforts to secure the
resignations of such number of directors as is necessary to enable Parent's designees to be elected to the Board of Directors of the Company in accordance with the terms of this section and to cause
Parent's designees so to be elected; 
provided, however,
 that, in the event that Parent's designees are elected to the Board of Directors of the Company,
until the Effective Time the Board of Directors of the Company shall have at least two directors who were directors on the date of the Merger Agreement, one of whom will be Mathew M. Perlot and one of
whom will be a director who is neither an officer of the Company nor a designee, shareholder, affiliate or associate (within the meaning of the federal securities laws) of Parent (such directors the
"Independent Directors").
Subject to applicable law, the Company shall promptly take all action necessary pursuant to Section 14(f) of the Securities
Exchange Act and Rule 14f-1 thereunder in order to fulfill its obligations under this section and shall include in the Schedule 14D-9 mailed to shareholders
promptly after the commencement of the Offer (or in an amendment thereof or an information statement pursuant to Rule 14f-1 if Parent has not theretofore designated directors) the
information with respect to the Company and its officers and directors as is required under Section 14(f) and Rule 14f-1 in order to fulfill its obligations under this
section.
Parent will supply the Company, and be solely responsible for, any information with respect to itself and its nominees, officers, directors and affiliates required by Section 14(f) and
Rule 14f-1.
Notwithstanding anything in the Merger Agreement to the contrary, subsequent to the election of the directors designated by Parent referred to in the first sentence of
this section to the Company's Board of Directors and prior to the Effective Time, the unanimous vote of the Independent Directors shall be required to (i) amend or terminate the Merger
Agreement on behalf of the 

Company, (ii) exercise or waive any of the Company's rights or remedies under the Merger Agreement, (iii) extend the time for performance of Parent's obligations under the Merger
Agreement, (iv) take any other action by the Company in connection with the Merger Agreement required to be taken by the Board of Directors of the Company, or (v) amend the Company's
Restated Articles of Incorporation or the Company's Restated Bylaws, each as in effect on the date of the Merger Agreement. 

    
Stock Options.
  
The Merger Agreement provides that each option outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time to
purchase Common Shares (a "Company Option") under the Company's 1994 Stock Incentive Plan (as amended to the date of the Merger Agreement) (the "1994 Plan") or any other stock option plan or agreement
of the Company, whether or not then vested or exercisable, shall at the Effective Time be automatically converted in its entirety into and represent solely the right to receive an amount in cash equal
to the positive difference, if any, between the Price Per Share and the per share exercise price of the Company Option multiplied by the number of Common Shares for which the Company Option was
exercisable immediately prior to the Effective Time, subject to reduction only for any applicable withholding taxes.
Except with respect to the right to receive an amount in cash as set forth in the
preceding sentence, each such Company Option shall at the Effective Time be automatically cancelled and terminated and of no further force or effect, and except as set forth in the preceding sentence
the holder thereof shall receive no consideration in connection with such cancellation and termination.
The Company has represented to Parent and Purchaser that all outstanding Company Options have
exercise prices in excess of the Price Per Share.
As a consequence, no consideration will be paid by Purchaser to holders of Company Options in connection with the Offer or Merger. 

    
Employee Benefit Matters.
  
The Merger Agreement provides that the Company and all Company subsidiaries agree to
terminate any and all group severance, separation or salary continuation plans, programs or arrangements (other than (i) the individual retirement agreements, as amended, between the Company
and Mathew M. Perlot and the Company and Curtis W. Lawler, (ii) the individual change of control agreements between the Company and William L. Rich, the Company and Steven D. Bettis, and the
Company and L. Michael Cary, and (iii) that certain severance plan established by the Board of Directors of the Company on February 21, 2001 for certain key employees of the Company), no
later than the business day prior to the Effective Date unless Parent provides written notice to Company that any such plans, programs or arrangements shall not be terminated.
Furthermore, the Company
and all Company subsidiaries agree to take corporate action to terminate any and all plans intended to
include a Code Section 401(k) arrangement no later than the business day prior to the day the Company becomes a member of the Parent's controlled group of corporations, as defined in
Section 1563(a) of the Code (the "Controlled Group Date") unless Parent provides written notice to Company that any such 401(k) plans shall not be terminated.
The Company has acknowledged that
the Controlled Group Date may be prior to the Effective Time and that it is the Company's sole responsibility to ensure that corporate action is taken to terminate any and all 401(k) plans at least
one business day prior to the Controlled Group Date.
Unless Parent provides written notice to the Company instructing the Company not to terminate its group severance, separation or salary
continuation plans, programs or arrangements and/or 401(k) plans, the Company shall provide Parent with evidence that such plans, programs or arrangements have been terminated pursuant to resolutions
of the Company's Board of Directors.
The Company also shall take such other actions in furtherance of terminating such plans, programs or arrangements as Parent may reasonably require. 

    
The
Merger Agreement further provides that as of the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the surviving corporation to honor and satisfy all obligations and liabilities with respect to
employee plans.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the surviving corporation shall not be required to continue any particular employee plan after the Effective Time, and any employee plan may be amended
or terminated in accordance with its terms and applicable law.
To the extent that any employee plan is 

terminated or amended after the Effective Date so as to eliminate the future benefits that are being provided with respect to participants thereunder, Parent shall arrange for each individual who is
then a participant in such terminated or amended plan to participate in a Parent benefit plan ("Parent Benefit Plan"), to the extent similarly situated employees of the Parent participate in such
Parent Benefit Plan, in accordance with the eligibility criteria thereof, provided that (i) such participant shall receive full credit for years of service with the Company or any of the
Company subsidiaries prior to the Effective Time for all purposes for which such service was recognized under the applicable employee plan (other than for sabbatical benefits and for benefit accrual
purposes under any defined benefit pension plan), including, but not limited to, recognition of service for eligibility, vesting (including acceleration thereof pursuant to the terms of the applicable
employee plan), and entitlement to commence benefits, 
provided, however
, that no service credit for benefit accrual purposes shall be provided in any
circumstance that would result in duplicative accrual of benefits, and 
provided, further,
 that relevant insurance carriers, outsider providers or the
like are able to honor such commitments on terms reasonably acceptable to Parent, provided, however, that Parent shall use its best efforts to ensure that the Company's employees who become Parent's
employees as of the Effective Date shall be given the opportunity to participate in Parent's 401(k) plan, subject to the terms and conditions of such plan, within thirty (30) days after the
Effective Date, (ii) Parent shall cause any and all pre-existing condition limitations (to the extent such limitations did not apply to a pre-existing condition under
the employee plans) and eligibility waiting periods under any group health plans to be waived with respect to such participant and his or her eligible dependents, 
provided,
however
, that the relevant insurance carriers, outsider providers or the like are able to honor such commitments on terms reasonably acceptable to Parent, and
(iii) Parent shall cause the Parent Benefit Plans that are group welfare plans to provide such participant with credit towards any applicable deductibles, co-payments and similar
exclusions for expenses incurred prior to the Effective Time, 
provided, however
, that the relevant insurance carriers, outsider providers or the like
are able to honor such commitments on terms reasonably acceptable to Parent.
The provisions of this section are described solely for purposes of disclosure, and the corresponding provisions of the
Merger Agreement constitute an obligation solely to the Company, and
neither are intended to and nor do they create rights in any person other than the Company itself (i.e. do not create any third party beneficiary rights). 

    
Indemnification and Insurance.
  
The Merger Agreement provides that from and after the Effective Time, the surviving
corporation shall indemnify and hold harmless all past and present officers and directors (the "Indemnified Parties") of the Company and of the Company subsidiaries to the full extent such persons may
be indemnified by the Company pursuant to Oregon law, the Company's Restated Articles of Incorporation and Restated Bylaws, as each is in effect on the date of the Merger Agreement, for acts and
omissions (x) arising out of or pertaining to the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement or arising out of the Offer documents or (y) otherwise with respect to any acts or
omissions occurring or arising at or prior to the Effective Time and shall advance reasonable litigation expenses incurred by such persons in connection with defending any action arising out of such
acts or omissions, provided that such persons provide the requisite affirmations and undertaking, as set forth in Section 60.397 of the OBCA. 

    
In
addition, Parent will provide, or cause the surviving corporation to provide, for a period of not less than six years after the Effective Time, the Company's current directors and
officers an insurance and indemnification policy that provides coverage for events occurring or arising at or prior to the Effective Time (the "D&O Insurance") that is no less favorable than the
existing policy or, if substantially equivalent insurance coverage is unavailable, the best available coverage; provided, however, that Parent and the surviving corporation shall not be required to
pay an annual premium for the D&O Insurance in excess of 200% of the annual premium currently paid by the Company for such insurance, but in such case shall purchase as much such coverage as possible
for such amount. 

    
The portion of the Merger Agreement corresponding to this section is intended to benefit the Indemnified Parties and shall be binding on all successors and assigns of Parent,
Purchaser, the Company and the surviving corporation.
Parent has guaranteed the performance by the surviving corporation of the indemnified obligations pursuant to the portion of the Merger Agreement
corresponding to this section. 

    
Reasonable Best Efforts.
  
The Merger Agreement provides that, subject to the terms and conditions thereof, the Company,
Parent and Purchaser each agree to use reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable to complete and make
effective as promptly as practicable the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, including, but not limited to, obtaining all consents from Governmental Authorities and other third parties
required for the completion of the Offer and the Merger and the transactions contemplated thereby.
Upon the terms and subject to the conditions of the Merger Agreement, the Company, Parent and
Purchaser have agreed to use reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary to satisfy the other conditions of the closing of
the Merger set forth in the Merger Agreement. 

    
Representations and Warranties.
  
The Merger Agreement contains various customary representations and warranties,
including representations relating to: corporate organization and good standing; capitalization; authorization to enter into the Merger Agreement; compliance with laws; financial statements;
litigation; material contracts and compliance therewith; employee benefit plans; taxes; intellectual property; labor matters; owned and leased premises; environmental matters; product liability and
recalls; customers; interested party transactions; and various other matters. 

    
Procedure for Amendment, Extension, Waiver or Termination.
  
The Merger Agreement may be amended by the parties at any
time prior to the Effective Time; 
provided, however
, that after the purchase of Shares pursuant to the Offer, no amendment shall be made which decreases
the Merger Consideration, and after the Company Shareholder Approval has been obtained, there shall not be made any amendment that by law requires further approval by the shareholders of the Company
without the further approval of such shareholders.
The Merger Agreement may not be amended except by an instrument in writing signed on behalf of each of the parties. 

    
At
any time prior to the Effective Time, a party may (a) extend the time for the performance of any of the obligations or other acts of the other parties, (b) waive any
inaccuracies in the representations and warranties of the other parties contained in the Merger Agreement or in any document delivered pursuant to the Merger Agreement or (c) subject to the
proviso of the previous paragraph, waive compliance by the other party with any of the agreements or conditions contained in the Merger Agreement.
Any agreement on the part of a party to any such
extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in an instrument in writing signed on behalf of such party.
The failure of any party to the
Merger Agreement to assert any of its rights under the Merger Agreement or otherwise shall not constitute a waiver of such rights. 

    
The
foregoing summary of the Merger Agreement is qualified in its entirety by reference to, and is in no way intended to modify, supplement or supersede the terms and conditions of,
the Merger Agreement, a copy of which is filed as Exhibit 99.(d)(1) to the Schedule TO.
The Merger Agreement should be read in its entirety for a more complete description of the matters
summarized above. 


The Confidentiality Agreement  

    Pursuant to that certain letter agreement dated March 21, 2001 by and among Parent and McDonald, on behalf of itself and as agent for the Company,
concerning confidentiality (the "Confidentiality Agreement"), the Company and Parent agreed to keep confidential certain information provided by the Company or its representatives.
The Confidentiality
Agreement also contains 

customary standstill provisions.
The Merger Agreement provides that the Confidentiality Agreement remains in force and effect according to its terms. 


Appraisal Rights  

    No dissenters' rights are available in connection with the Offer.
Under the OBCA, dissenters' rights are not available in a merger to holders of any shares of
any stock which, like the Company's common stock, are listed for quotation on the Nasdaq National Market System.
Accordingly, if the Company's common stock remains listed on the Nasdaq National Market
System following completion of the Offer, the Company's shareholders will have no dissenters' rights in connection with the Merger.
If, however, the Company's common stock is not quoted on the Nasdaq
National Market System on the record date for determining shareholders eligible to vote on the Merger, shareholders of the Company may have certain rights under the OBCA to dissent, and demand
appraisal of, and to obtain payment for the fair value of their Shares.
Such rights, if the statutory procedures were complied with, could lead to a judicial determination of the fair value of the
Shares (excluding any element of value arising from the accomplishment or expectation of the Merger) to be required to be paid in cash to such dissenting holders for their Shares.
In addition, such
dissenting shareholders would be entitled to received payment of a fair rate of interest from the date of consummation of the Merger on the amount determined to be the fair value of their Shares.
In
determining the fair value of the Shares, an Oregon court would be required to take into account all relevant factors.
Accordingly, such determination could be based upon considerations other than, or
in addition to, the market value of the Shares.
Therefore, the value so determined in any appraisal proceeding could be different from the price being paid in the Offer. 

    
The
foregoing summary of the Appraisal Provisions does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to Section 60.551 through 60.594 of the OBCA. 


Going-Private Transactions  

    The Commission has adopted Rule 13e-3 under the Exchange Act, which is applicable to certain "going private" transactions.
Purchaser does
not believe that Rule 13e-3 will be applicable to the Merger unless the Merger is consummated more than one year after the termination of the Offer.
If applicable,
Rule 13e-3 requires, among other things, that certain financial information concerning the fairness of the Merger and the consideration offered to minority shareholders in the
Merger be filed with the Commission and disclosed to shareholders prior to the consummation of the Merger. 


13.  
Certain Conditions of the Offer  

    The Merger Agreement provides that, notwithstanding any other provision of the Offer, Purchaser shall not be required to accept for payment or, subject to any
applicable rules and regulations of the Commission, including Rule 14e-1(c) under the Exchange Act (relating to Purchaser's obligation to pay for or return tendered Shares promptly
after termination or withdrawal of the Offer), pay for, and (subject to any such rules or regulations) may delay the acceptance for payment of any tendered Shares and (except as provided in the Merger
Agreement) amend or terminate the Offer as to any Shares not then paid for if (i) the Minimum Condition has not been satisfied, (ii) any applicable waiting period under the HSR Act shall
not have expired or been terminated prior to the expiration of the Offer, or (iii) at any time after the date of the Merger Agreement and before the time of payment for any Shares (whether or
not any Shares have theretofore been accepted for payment or paid for pursuant to the Offer), any of the following conditions exists: 

    (a) there
shall be in effect an injunction or other order, decree, judgment or ruling by a Governmental Authority of competent jurisdiction or a law shall have been
promulgated or enacted by a Governmental Authority of competent jurisdiction which in any such case (i) restrains 

or prohibits the making or completion of the Offer or the completion of the Merger, (ii) prohibits or restricts the ownership or operation by Parent (or any of its affiliates or subsidiaries)
of any portion of the Company's business or assets if it would substantially deprive Parent and/or its affiliates or subsidiaries of the benefit of ownership of the Company's business or assets, or
compels Parent (or any of its affiliates or subsidiaries) to dispose of or hold separate any portion of the Company's business or assets if it would substantially deprive Parent and/or its affiliates
or subsidiaries of the benefit of ownership of the Company's business or assets, (iii) imposes material limitations on the ability of
Purchaser effectively to acquire or to hold or to exercise full rights of ownership of the Shares, including, without limitation, the right to vote Shares purchased by Purchaser pursuant to the Offer
or the Merger on all matters properly presented to the shareholders of the Company, or (iv) imposes any material limitations on the ability of Parent and/or its affiliates or subsidiaries
effectively to control in any material respect the business and operations of the Company; or 

    (b) there
shall have been instituted, pending or threatened an action by a Governmental Authority seeking to restrain or prohibit the making or completion of the Offer
or completion of the Merger, or to impose any other restriction, prohibition or limitation referred to in the foregoing paragraph (a); or 

    (c) the
Merger Agreement shall have been terminated by the Company or Parent in accordance with its terms; or 

    (d) there
shall have occurred (i) any general suspension of, or limitation on prices for, trading in the Shares on Nasdaq (other than any coordinated trading
halt as a result of a specified increase or decrease in a market index, (ii) a declaration of a banking moratorium or any general suspension of payments in respect of banks in the United States
or (iii) in the case of any of the foregoing existing at the time of the execution of the Merger Agreement, a material acceleration or worsening thereof; or 

    (e) Parent
and the Company shall have agreed that Purchaser shall amend the Offer, terminate the Offer or postpone the payment for Shares pursuant to the Offer; or 

    (f)  any
of the representations and warranties made by the Company in the Merger Agreement shall not have been true and correct when made, or shall thereafter have
ceased to be true and correct prior to the closing of the Merger (other than representations and warranties made as of a specified date) (in each case without, for this purpose, giving effect to
qualifications of materiality contained in such representation and warranties), if such failure to be true and correct, individually or in the aggregate, would reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect, or the Company shall not have performed each obligation and agreement and complied with each covenant to be performed and complied with by it under the Merger Agreement in all
material respects; 
provided, however
, that such breach or failure to perform is incapable of being cured or has not been cured within 5 days
after the giving of written notice thereof to the Company; 
provided
, further that no such 5-day cure period shall require extension of the
Offer beyond the 20 business days extension period permitted under the Agreement; or 

    (g) Parent
shall not have received an officer's certificate from the Company, executed by the Company's Chairman of the Board and by the Company's Chief Executive
Officer, dated as of the expiration date of the Offer, certifying that all of the representations and warranties made by the Company in the Merger Agreement were true and correct when made and
continue to be true and correct as of the date of such certificate (other than representations and warranties made as of a specified date, as to which shall be certified that such representations and
warranties were true and correct as of such date)
(in each case without, for this purpose, giving effect to qualifications of materiality contained in such representation and warranties), and that the Company has performed 

each obligation and agreement and complied with each covenant to be performed and complied with under the Merger Agreement in all material respects; or 

    (h) the
Company's Board of Directors shall have modified or amended its recommendation of the Offer in any manner adverse to Parent or shall have withdrawn its
recommendation of the Offer, or shall have recommended acceptance of any Company Takeover Proposal or shall have resolved to do any of the foregoing; or 

    (i)  any
change, development, effect or circumstance shall have occurred or be threatened that would reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect with
respect to the Company; or 

    (j)  either
Mathew M. Perlot or Curtis W. Lawler shall have materially breached any representation or warranty, or materially failed to perform or announced any
intention to materially fail to perform any material agreement or covenant, of such person under the shareholder's agreements entered into by such persons with Parent. 

    
The
foregoing conditions are for the sole benefit of Parent and Purchaser and may be asserted by Parent or Purchaser regardless of the circumstances giving rise to any such condition
and may be waived by Parent or Purchaser, in whole or in part, at any time and from time to time, in the sole discretion of Parent.
The failure by Parent or Purchaser at any time to exercise any of
the foregoing rights shall not be deemed a waiver of any right, the waiver of such right with respect to any particular facts or circumstances shall not be deemed a waiver with respect to any other
facts or circumstances, and each right shall be deemed an ongoing right which may be asserted at any time and from time to time. 

    
If
the Offer is terminated pursuant to the foregoing provisions, all tendered Shares not accepted for payment shall be promptly returned to the tendering shareholders. 


14.  
Certain Legal Matters  

    Except as described in this Section 14, based on a review of publicly available filings made by the Company with the Commission and other publicly
available information concerning the Company and
discussions of representatives of Parent with representatives of the Company, none of Purchaser, Parent or the Company is aware of any license or regulatory permit that appears to be material to the
business of the Company and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole, that might be adversely affected by Purchaser's acquisition of Shares (and the indirect acquisition of the stock of the Company's
subsidiaries) as contemplated herein or of any approval or other action by any Governmental Authority that would be required or desirable for the acquisition or ownership of Shares by Purchaser as
contemplated herein.
Should any such approval or other action be required or desirable, Parent and Purchaser currently contemplate that such approval or other action will be sought, except as
described below under "State Takeover Laws".
While (except as otherwise expressly described in this Section 14)
Purchaser does not presently intend to delay the acceptance for payment of or
payment for Shares tendered pursuant to the Offer pending the outcome of any such matter, there can be no assurance that any such approval or other action, if needed, would be obtained or would be
obtained without substantial conditions or that failure to obtain any such approval or other action might not result in consequences adverse to the Company's business or that certain parts of the
Company's business might not have to be disposed of if such approvals were not obtained or such other actions were not taken or in order to obtain any such approval or other action.
If certain types
of adverse action are taken with respect to the matters discussed below, Purchaser could, subject to the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement, decline to accept for payment or pay for any
Shares tendered.
See Section 13 for a description of certain conditions to the Offer. 

    
State Takeover Laws.
  
The Company and certain of its subsidiaries conduct business in a number of states throughout the
United States, some of which have adopted laws and regulations applicable to offers to acquire shares of corporations that are incorporated or have substantial assets, shareholders and/or a principal
place of business in such states.
In 
Edgar v. MITE Corp.
, the Supreme Court of the United States held that the Illinois Business Takeover Statute, which
involved state securities laws that made the takeover of certain corporations more difficult, imposed a substantial burden on interstate commerce and was therefore unconstitutional.
In 

CTS Corp. v. Dynamics Corp. of
America
, however, the Supreme Court of the United States held that a state may, as a matter of corporate law and, in
particular, those laws concerning corporate governance, constitutionally disqualify a potential acquiror from voting on the affairs of a target corporation without prior approval of the remaining
shareholders, PROVIDED that such laws were applicable only under certain conditions, in particular, that the corporation has a substantial number of shareholders in and is incorporated under the laws
of such state.
The Company is incorporated under the laws of the State of Oregon. 

    
In
general, Sections 60.825 to 60.845 of the OBCA prevent an "interested shareholder" (including a person who owns or has the right to acquire 15% or more of the corporation's
outstanding voting stock) from engaging in a "business combination" (defined to include mergers and certain other actions) with an Oregon corporation for a period of three years following the date
such person became an interested shareholder unless prior to the date that such shareholder became an interested shareholder the board of directors of the company approved either the business
combination or the transaction which resulted in the shareholder becoming an interested shareholder.
As a result, and irrespective of the constitutionality of these provisions, since the Company's
Board of Directors has approved the Merger Agreement these provisions of the OBCA will not prevent Purchaser from completing the anticipated Merger with the Company. 

    
An
additional Oregon takeover statute is found in Sections 60.801 to 60.816 of the OBCA (the "Control Share Act").
The Control Share Act generally provides that a person (the
"Acquiror") who acquires voting stock of an "issuing public corporation" (a corporation with one hundred or more shareholders, its principal place of business in Oregon, and either ten percent or ten
thousand of its shareholders in Oregon) in a transaction that results in the Acquiror holding more than 20%, 33

/

% or 50% of the total voting power of the corporation (a "Control Share
Acquisition") cannot vote the shares it acquires in the Control Share Acquisition except in certain circumstances.
Under Oregon law a corporation may provide in its Articles of Incorporation or Bylaws
that the Control Share Act does not apply to the corporation.
The Company's Bylaws provide that the Control Share Act does not apply to acquisitions of the Company's voting shares and thus does not
apply to the Offer and the Merger. 

    
Neither
Parent nor Purchaser has determined whether any other state takeover laws and regulations will by their terms apply to the Offer, and, except as set forth above, neither
Parent nor Purchaser has presently sought to comply with any state takeover statute or regulation.
Parent and Purchaser reserve the right to challenge the applicability or validity of any state law or
regulation purporting to apply to the Offer or the Merger, and neither anything in this Offer nor any action taken in connection herewith is intended as a waiver of such right.
In the event it is
asserted that one or more state takeover statutes is applicable to the Offer or the Merger and an appropriate court does not determine that such statute is inapplicable or invalid as applied to the
Offer or the Merger, Parent or Purchaser might be required to file certain information with, or to receive approval from, the relevant state authorities, and Purchaser might be unable to accept for
payment or pay for Shares tendered pursuant to the Offer, or be delayed in consummating the Offer. 


Antitrust  

    United States Antitrust Law.
  
Under the provisions of the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of
1976, as amended, and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder (the "HSR Act") applicable to the Offer, the acquisition of Shares under the Offer may be consummated 

without any need for Parent to file an HSR Notification and Report Form (an "HSR Filing") with respect to the Offer with the Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice and the Federal Trade
Commission (the "FTC"). 

    
Despite
the face that no HSR Filing will be required in order to complete the Offer and the Merger, the Antitrust Division and the FTC frequently scrutinize the legality under the
antitrust laws of transactions such as Purchaser's proposed acquisition of the Company.
At any time before or after
Purchaser's acquisition of Shares pursuant to the Offer, the Antitrust Division or the FTC could take such action under the antitrust laws as it deems necessary or desirable in the public interest,
including seeking to enjoin the purchase of Shares pursuant to the Offer or the consummation of the Merger or seeking the divestiture of Shares acquired by Purchaser or the divestiture of substantial
assets of the Company or its subsidiaries or Parent or its subsidiaries.
Private parties may also bring legal action under the antitrust laws under certain circumstances.
There can be no assurance
that a challenge to the Offer on antitrust grounds will not be made or, if such a challenge is made, of the result thereof. 

    
Other Foreign Laws.
  
The Company and Parent and certain of their respective subsidiaries conduct business in several
foreign countries where regulatory filings or approvals may be required or desirable in connection with the consummation of the Offer.
Certain of such filings or approvals, if required or desirable,
may not be made or obtained prior to the expiration of the Offer.
Purchaser and the Company are analyzing the applicability of any such laws and currently intend to take such action as may be required
or desirable.
If any foreign Governmental Authority takes any action prior to the completion of the Offer that might have certain adverse effects, Purchaser will not be obligated to accept for payment
or pay for any Shares tendered. 


15.  
Fees and Expenses  

    Salomon Smith Barney is acting as Dealer Manager for the Offer and as financial advisor to Parent in connection with Parent's proposed acquisition of the
Company, for which services Salomon Smith Barney will receive customary compensation.
Parent also has agreed to reimburse Salomon Smith Barney for reasonable travel and other
out-of-pocket expenses, including reasonable fees and expenses of its legal counsel, and to indemnify Salomon Smith Barney and certain related parties against certain
liabilities, including liabilities under the federal securities laws, arising out of its engagement.
In the ordinary course of business, Salomon Smith Barney and its affiliates may actively trade or
hold the securities of Parent and the Company for their own account and for the accounts of customers and, accordingly, may at any time hold a long or short position in such securities. 

    
Parent
and Purchaser have retained Innisfree to act as the Information Agent and Wells Fargo to serve as the Depositary in connection with the Offer.
The Information Agent and the
Depositary each will receive reasonable and customary compensation for their services, be reimbursed for certain reasonable out-of-pocket expenses and be indemnified against
certain liabilities and expenses in connection therewith, including certain liabilities and expenses under the U.S. federal securities laws. 

    
Neither
Purchaser nor Parent will pay any fees or commissions to any broker or dealer or other person (other than the Dealer Manager) in connection with the solicitation of tenders of
Shares pursuant to the Offer.
Brokers, dealers, banks, trust companies and other members will be reimbursed by Purchaser upon request for customary mailing and handling expenses incurred by them in
forwarding material to their customers. 


16.  
Miscellaneous  

    
The Offer is not being made to (nor will tenders be accepted from or on behalf of) holders of Shares in any jurisdiction in which the making of the Offer or
the acceptance thereof would not be in compliance with the laws of such jurisdiction.
Neither Purchaser nor Parent is aware of any jurisdiction in which the making of the Offer or the acceptance
thereof would not be in compliance with the laws 

of such jurisdiction.
To the extent Purchaser or Parent becomes aware of any state law that would limit the class of offerees in the Offer, Purchaser will amend the Offer and, depending on the timing
of such amendment, if any, will extend the Offer to provide adequate dissemination of such information to holders of Shares prior to the expiration of the Offer.
In any jurisdiction the securities,
blue sky or other laws of which require the Offer to be made by a licensed broker or dealer, the Offer is being made on behalf of Purchaser by the Dealer Manager or one or more registered brokers or
dealers licensed under the laws of such jurisdiction. 

    
NO
PERSON HAS BEEN AUTHORIZED TO GIVE ANY INFORMATION OR TO MAKE ANY REPRESENTATION ON BEHALF OF PURCHASER OR PARENT NOT CONTAINED HEREIN OR IN THE LETTER OF TRANSMITTAL AND, IF GIVEN
OR MADE, SUCH INFORMATION OR REPRESENTATION MUST NOT BE RELIED UPON AS HAVING BEEN AUTHORIZED. 

    
Parent
and Purchaser have filed with the Commission the Schedule TO pursuant to Rule 14d-3 under the Exchange Act, together with exhibits, furnishing certain
additional information with respect to the Offer, and may file amendments thereto.
In addition, the Company has filed the Schedule 14D-9 pursuant to Rule 14d-9
under the Exchange Act, together with exhibits, setting forth its recommendation with respect to the Offer and the reasons for such recommendation and furnishing certain additional related
information.
Such Schedules and any amendments thereto, including exhibits, should be available for inspection and copies should be obtainable in the manner set forth in Section 8 (except that
such material will not be available at the regional offices of the Commission).

collectively constitute the "Offer"), receipt of which is hereby acknowledged. 

    
Upon
the terms of the Offer, subject to, and effective upon, acceptance for payment of, and payment for, the Shares tendered herewith in accordance with the terms of the Offer, the
undersigned hereby sells, assigns and transfers to, or upon the order of, the Purchaser all right, title and interest in and to all the Shares that are being tendered hereby (and any and all other
Shares or other securities or rights issued in respect thereof on or after the date of the Offer to Purchase) and irrevocably constitutes and appoints Wells Fargo Bank Minnesota, N.A. (the
"Depositary"), the true and lawful agent and attorney-in-fact of the undersigned, with full power of substitution (such power of attorney being deemed to be an irrevocable power coupled with an
interest), to the full extent of the undersigned's rights with respect to such Shares (and any such other Shares or securities or rights) (a) to deliver certificates for such Shares (and any
such other Shares or securities or rights) or transfer ownership of such Shares (and any such other Shares or securities or rights) on the account books maintained by the Book-Entry Transfer Facility

or other securities or rights issued or issuable in respect of such Shares on or after the date of the Offer to Purchase) and, when the same are accepted for payment by the Purchaser, the Purchaser
will acquire good title thereto, free and clear of all liens, restrictions, claims and encumbrances and the same will not be subject to any adverse claim.
The undersigned will, upon request, execute
any additional documents deemed by the Depositary or the Purchaser to be necessary or desirable to complete the sale, assignment and transfer of the tendered Shares (and any such other Shares or other
securities or rights). 

    
All
