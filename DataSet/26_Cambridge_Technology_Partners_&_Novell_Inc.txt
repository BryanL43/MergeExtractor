Background of the merger

   In March 2000, Novell engaged Morgan Stanley & Co.
Incorporated as financial
advisors to assist in considering strategic options, including possible
acquisitions and business combinations.
During the latter part of 2000 and
early 2001, senior management and the board of directors of Novell considered
various strategic alternatives to increase stockholder value, including a sale
of Novell in whole or in part and a spin-off or joint venture involving Novell
subsidiaries.

   
On January 19, 2001, following a meeting of the Novell board in San Jose,
California, Dr. Eric E. Schmidt, chairman, president and chief executive
officer of Novell, approached Jack L. Messman, the president, chief executive
officer and a director of Cambridge, regarding a possible strategic combination
between the two companies.
Mr. Messman is currently, and has been since 1985, a
director of Novell and he is also a director of Safeguard Scientifics, Inc.
Dr.
Schmidt and Mr. Messman discussed the companies' histories, relevant
operational issues, stockholder bases and key employees.

   
On February 1, 2001, the Novell board of directors met to consider the
potential acquisition of Cambridge.
The board considered the possibility of Mr.
Messman becoming the chief executive officer of a combined entity.
The board
authorized management to continue discussions with Cambridge.

   
On February 2, 2001, Dr. Schmidt called Mr. Messman to continue their
discussion and during this discussion Dr. Schmidt suggested that Mr. Messman
replace him as president and chief executive officer of Novell effective upon
the closing of any eventual transaction between the parties.

   
On February 6, 2001, Dr. Schmidt, Mr. Messman and Warren V. Musser, the
chairman of the board of Cambridge and, at the time, the chief executive
officer of Safeguard, met in Cambridge, Massachusetts, to continue these
discussions.

   
On February 7, 2001, Cambridge retained Salomon Smith Barney Inc. as its
financial advisor and Morgan, Lewis & Bockius LLP as its special transaction
counsel in connection with a possible transaction with Novell.
Salomon Smith
Barney received several inquiries from industry participants and financial
investors regarding potential transactions involving Cambridge.
None of the
inquiries received by Salomon Smith Barney resulted in serious negotiations and
no party other than Novell conducted due diligence.

   
Also on February 7, 2001, Dennis Raney, executive vice president and chief
financial officer of Novell, met with members of Cambridge management in
Cambridge, Massachusetts to discuss the merits of combining Novell's and
Cambridge's operations.

board regarding the directors' duties and responsibilities in considering a
potential transaction with Novell.

attorneys for Novell and Cambridge began conducting their respective legal due
diligence reviews on February 9, 2001.

financial due diligence.

   
On February 12, 2001, Mr. Messman met in San Jose, California with Dr.
Schmidt, John A. Young, a director of Novell, and Larry W. Sonsini, a director
of Novell and a member of Novell's outside legal counsel, Wilson Sonsini
Goodrich & Rosati, Professional Corporation, to have further discussions
regarding a possible transaction between Cambridge and Novell.

   
Also on February 12, 2001, members of Cambridge management, including Mr.

to conduct further due diligence and review the potential transaction benefits.

   
From March 6, 2001 through March 11, 2001, representatives from Novell and
Cambridge and its financial advisor and their respective advisors continued to

On March 8, 2001, the Novell board of directors met to review reports by

due diligence and negotiations with Cambridge.
The board discussed the reports
and instructed management and Novell's legal and financial advisors to continue
with due diligence and negotiations.

   
On March 9, 2001, the Cambridge board met via telephone.
Present at the
meeting were the directors, senior management of Cambridge, Salomon Smith
Barney and Howard L. Shecter of Morgan Lewis.
Mr. Messman began the meeting by
reviewing the status of the proposed transaction with Novell and by providing a
strategic overview.
He then summarized the diligence efforts to date.
Salomon
Smith Barney then made a presentation, providing an overview of their
preliminary analysis of the proposed transaction, a detailed review of the

and related documents.
Novell's financial advisors then gave a presentation to
the board.


The board discussed, among other things, the status of negotiations, the
potential benefits and risks of the transaction and the principal terms of the
proposed merger.
Following discussion, the Novell board approved the
transaction on the terms presented with instructions to management to negotiate
and finalize the open issues and to sign the merger agreement later that day.

   
Also on March 12, 2001, the Cambridge board met to review the terms of the
transaction.
At this meeting, the members of management of Cambridge discussed
the results of the negotiations and the terms of the proposed merger, including
status and timing of the transaction, pricing and valuation of the proposed
merger, strategies and business opportunities with Novell, various business
issues relating to the merger, and a review of Novell's financial performance
and prospects.
Mr. Shecter made a presentation to the Cambridge board during
which he reminded the directors of their duties and responsibilities under
Delaware law.
He then summarized the results of Morgan Lewis's due diligence
review and outlined the terms of the proposed merger agreement, including
restrictions on Cambridge's ability to pursue alternative transactions, closing
conditions and termination provisions, the voting agreement, affiliate
agreements and other relevant documents.
Lastly, Mr. Shecter identified the
final outstanding legal issues, and he apprised the Cambridge board that some
officers and directors of Cambridge, including Mr. Messman, had interests which
might conflict with the interests of Cambridge stockholders.
Following Mr.
Shecter's presentation, Salomon Smith Barney presented an analysis of the
financial terms of the proposed merger with Novell and delivered its oral
opinion, subsequently confirmed in writing as of March 12, 2001, as to the
fairness of the exchange ratio, from a financial point of view, to the holders
of Cambridge common stock.
Following these presentations and the related
discussions by the Cambridge board, the Cambridge board of directors concluded
that the merger was in the best interests of Cambridge stockholders, declared
the merger advisable, approved the proposed terms of the merger and the merger
agreement in substantially the form presented, authorized Cambridge's officers
to complete the negotiations and execute the merger agreement and resolved to
recommend that Cambridge stockholders vote to adopt the merger agreement.
In
connection with the merger, the board also resolved to amend the Cambridge
stockholder rights plan to exempt Novell and the merger from the provisions of
the rights plan.
Warren Musser, a Cambridge director who was then the chief
executive officer of Safeguard, abstained from the vote citing unique
investment company issues faced by Safeguard as a result of the proposed
transaction as the reason for abstention.

   
After the close of trading on March 12, 2001, Cambridge, Novell and Ceres
Neptune entered into the merger agreement and Mr. Messman entered into a voting
agreement with Novell.
In addition, Cambridge amended its stockholder rights
plan.
Immediately following the signing of the merger agreement, Novell and
Cambridge issued a joint press release announcing the merger.


Joint reasons for the merger

   The boards of directors of Novell and Cambridge have determined that a
combined company would be positioned to compete more effectively in the market,
thereby increasing the potential for improved long-term operating and financial
results.
In particular, the boards believe that the merger will create the
opportunity for Novell and Cambridge to:

  .
provide their customers with new Web-based products and services that
    will better serve the needs of customers;

  .
develop software products that help extend businesses to better utilize
    the Internet; and

  .
develop products around leading application platforms and other
    information technology resources supported by Net services software from
    Novell.


Recommendation of, and factors considered by, the Cambridge board of directors

   At a meeting of the Cambridge board of directors on March 12, 2001, after
due consideration, the Cambridge board:

  .
determined that the merger is in the best interests of Cambridge and its
    stockholders;

  .
approved the merger and the merger agreement; and

  .
determined to recommend that the stockholders of Cambridge adopt the
    merger agreement and approve the transactions contemplated thereby.


Accordingly, the Cambridge board of directors recommends that the Cambridge
stockholders vote FOR adoption of the merger agreement.

   
In reaching its decision to approve the merger and to recommend such merger
to its stockholders, the board of directors consulted with Cambridge senior
management and with Cambridge's advisors, Salomon Smith Barney and Morgan
Lewis.
In reaching its decision, the board considered all of the reasons
described above under "Joint Reasons for the Merger," including the board's
belief that a combined company would be positioned to compete more effectively
in the market, thereby increasing the potential for improved long-term
operating and financial results.
The Cambridge board also considered the
following factors which it believes favor approval of the merger:

  .
Merger Consideration--The Cambridge board analyzed the market value of
    the Novell common stock to be issued in exchange for each share of
    Cambridge common stock in light of comparable merger transactions.

  .
Opinion of Salomon Smith Barney--The Cambridge board considered the
    opinion of Salomon Smith Barney, issued on March 12, 2001 to the
    Cambridge board of directors as to the fairness, from a financial point
    of view, of the exchange ratio to the holders of Cambridge common stock.
    
A copy of the Salomon Smith Barney opinion is attached as Annex B hereto.

  .
Presentation of Salomon Smith Barney--The Cambridge board considered the
    various financial information, valuation analyses and other factors set
    forth in the presentation by Salomon Smith Barney at the Cambridge board
    meeting on March 12, 2001, including those described below in the section
    entitled "Opinion of Cambridge's financial advisor.
"

  .
Historical Information--The Cambridge board considered historical
    information concerning Novell's and Cambridge's respective businesses,
    financial performance and conditions, operations, technologies,
    management and competitive positions, including public reports concerning
    results of operations during the most recent fiscal year and fiscal
    quarter for each company filed with the Securities and Exchange
    Commission.

  .
Market Conditions--The Cambridge board considered current financial
    market conditions, historical market prices, and volatility and trading
    information with respect to Novell common stock and Cambridge common
    stock.

  .
Available Alternatives--The Cambridge board considered potential
    transactions with third parties based on inquiries made by Salomon Smith
    Barney at the direction of Cambridge management, as well as Cambridge
    management's view on the potential for other third parties to enter into
    strategic relationships with, or to acquire, Cambridge.

  .
Possible Decline in Market Price of Cambridge Shares--The Cambridge board
    considered the possibility that if a transaction with Novell is not
    consummated and Cambridge remained a publicly owned corporation, the
    price that might be received by Cambridge stockholders in the open market
    or in a future transaction might be less than the consideration to be
    received pursuant to the merger.

  .
Terms of the Merger Agreement--The Cambridge board considered the terms
    of the merger agreement, including, among others, the circumstances under
    which the Cambridge board may withdraw its recommendation of the merger,
    the Cambridge board's ability to consider a superior acquisition proposal
    and the conditions to closing of the merger.

  .
Tax-Deferred Nature of Transaction--The Cambridge board noted that the
    merger is expected to be a tax-deferred transaction.

  .
Transaction Accounted for as a Purchase--The Cambridge board noted that
    the merger is expected to be accounted for as a purchase transaction.

  .
Trends in the Industry--The Cambridge board considered various trends in
    the information technology industry and the effect of industry
    consolidation on Cambridge's ability to compete effectively in existing
    markets.

  .
Board Representation--The Cambridge board considered the fact that the
    merger agreement provides for the appointment of two Cambridge
    representatives to the board of directors of Novell effective upon the
    closing of the merger.
The Cambridge board also noted that Jack L.
    Messman, the president and chief executive officer of Cambridge,
    currently serves on the Novell board and would continue to serve on the
    Novell board following the closing.

  .
President and Chief Executive Officer--The Cambridge board considered
    Novell's proposal that Jack L. Messman assume the position of president
    and chief executive officer of Novell effective upon the closing of the
    merger.

   
Cambridge's board of directors also identified and considered a variety of
potentially negative factors in its deliberations concerning the merger,
including, but not limited to:

  .
the possibility that the merger might not be consummated, and the fact
    that under some circumstances Cambridge might be required to pay a
    termination fee to Novell;

  .
the potential conflict between the interests of some Cambridge officers
    and directors, including Mr. Messman, and the interests of Cambridge
    stockholders;

  .
the effect that the public announcement of the merger might have on
    Cambridge's sales and operating results, Cambridge's ability to attract
    and retain key personnel and the progress of Cambridge's current
    development and marketing projects;

  .
the risk that potential benefits sought in the merger might not be fully
    realized, that some of Cambridge's customers may view Novell as their
    competitor and seek to terminate their relationships with Cambridge and
    that the combined company may not be able to retain key personnel;

  .
the risk that, following the merger, some customers of Cambridge may view
    Cambridge as incapable of providing disinterested advice regarding
    software solutions;

  .
the limitations placed on Cambridge relating to its ability to pursue
    alternative transactions and to conduct its business prior to the
    closing; and

  .
the substantial costs to be incurred in connection with the merger,
    including the costs of integrating the businesses and transaction
    expenses arising from the merger.

   
After due consideration and discussion, Cambridge's board of directors
decided that these risks were outweighed by the potential benefits of the
merger.

   
The foregoing discussion is not exhaustive of all the factors considered by
Cambridge's board.
Each member of Cambridge's board may have considered
different factors, and the board did not quantify or otherwise assign relative
weights to factors considered.

   
After considering the recommendation of the board of directors with respect
to the merger agreement, you should be aware that some directors and officers
of Cambridge have interests in the merger that are different from, or are in
addition to, the interests of Cambridge stockholders generally.
Please see the
section entitled "Interests of Cambridge directors and officers in the merger"
beginning on page 41 of this proxy statement-prospectus.


Factors considered by the Novell board of directors

   The board of directors of Novell considered factors that it believes will
contribute to the success of the combined companies, including the following:

  .
enhanced solution selling capabilities;

  .
increased pace of Web-based deployments of business processes to
    accelerate revenue growth;

  .
expanded customer relationships among senior business managers;

  .
closer customer relationships with feedback to gain competitive advantage
    in the development of Net services software products and solutions
    support;

  .
accelerated introduction of Novell technology to clients, information
    technology services partners, and other leading independent software
    vendors;

  .
increased percentage of revenue derived from services;

  .
expanded management expertise around the design and delivery of
    solutions;

  .
enhanced ability to support complex solutions in the Internet and
    eBusiness marketplace;

  .
increased customer loyalty as a Net Services software vendor with design,
    implementation and maintenance services for business solutions;

  .
improved operating margins through elimination of redundant costs in the
    combined entity; and

  .
enhanced business model resulting in revenue synergy by combining
    software products with solution services to support the deployment of
    business processes and Web-based applications to the Internet.

   
After taking into account these and other factors, the Novell board of
directors unanimously determined that the merger agreement was in the best
interests of Novell and its stockholders and that Novell should enter into the
merger agreement and complete the merger.


Opinion of Cambridge's financial advisor

   On February 7, 2001, Salomon Smith Barney was retained to act as financial
advisor to Cambridge in connection with the merger.
Pursuant to Salomon Smith
Barney's engagement letter with Cambridge, Salomon Smith Barney rendered an
opinion to the Cambridge board of directors on March 12, 2001, to the effect
that, based upon and subject to the considerations and limitations set forth in
the opinion, its work described below and other factors it deemed relevant, as
of that date, the exchange ratio was fair, from a financial point of view, to
holders of Cambridge common stock.

   
The full text of Salomon Smith Barney's opinion, which sets forth the
assumptions made, general procedures followed, matters considered and limits on
the review undertaken, is included as Annex B to this document.
The summary of
Salomon Smith Barney's opinion set forth below is qualified in its entirety by
reference to the full text of the opinion.
Stockholders are urged to read
Salomon Smith Barney's opinion carefully and in its entirety.

   
In arriving at its opinion, Salomon Smith Barney reviewed a draft of the
merger agreement, dated March 10, 2001, and held discussions with certain
senior officers and other representatives and advisors of each of Cambridge and
Novell concerning the businesses, operations and prospects of Cambridge and
Novell.
Salomon Smith Barney examined certain publicly available business and
financial information relating to Cambridge and Novell.
Salomon Smith Barney
reviewed the financial terms of the merger as set forth in the merger agreement
in relation to, among other things, current and historical market prices and
trading volumes of Cambridge common stock and Novell common stock, the
historical and projected earnings and other operating data of Cambridge and
Novell, and the historical and projected capitalization and financial condition
of Cambridge and Novell.
Salomon Smith Barney considered, to the extent
publicly available, the financial

terms of certain other similar transactions recently effected which Salomon
Smith Barney considered relevant in evaluating the merger and analyzed certain
financial, stock market and other publicly available information relating to
the businesses of other companies whose operations Salomon Smith Barney
considered relevant in evaluating those of Cambridge and Novell.
In addition to
the foregoing, Salomon Smith Barney conducted such other analyses and
examinations and considered such other information and financial, economic and
market criteria as Salomon Smith Barney deemed appropriate in arriving at its
opinion.

   
In rendering its opinion, Salomon Smith Barney assumed and relied, without
independent verification, upon the accuracy and completeness of all financial
and other information and data publicly available or
furnished to or otherwise reviewed by or discussed with it.
With respect to
financial forecasts and other information and data provided to or otherwise
reviewed by or discussed with Salomon Smith Barney, Salomon Smith Barney was
advised by the managements of Cambridge and Novell that such forecasts and
other information and data had been reasonably prepared on bases reflecting the
best currently available estimates and judgments of Cambridge and Novell
management as to the future financial performance of Cambridge and Novell.

Salomon Smith Barney expressed no view with respect to such forecasts and other
information and data or the assumptions on which they were based.
Salomon Smith
Barney assumed, with the consent of the Cambridge board of directors, that the
merger will be treated as a tax-free reorganization for United States federal
income purposes.
Salomon Smith Barney did not make and was not provided with an
independent evaluation or appraisal of the assets or liabilities (contingent or
otherwise) of Cambridge or Novell, nor did it make any physical inspection of
the properties or assets of Cambridge or Novell.
Cambridge advised Salomon
Smith Barney, and Salomon Smith Barney assumed, that the final terms of the
merger agreement would not vary materially from those set forth in the draft
reviewed by it.
Salomon Smith Barney further assumed that the merger would be
consummated in accordance with the terms of the merger agreement without waiver
of any of the conditions precedent to the merger contained in the merger
agreement.

   
Salomon Smith Barney did not express any opinion as to what the value of the
Novell common stock actually will be when issued in the merger or the price at
which Novell common stock will trade subsequent to the merger.
Salomon Smith
Barney was not requested to consider, and its opinion did not address, the
relative merits of the merger as compared to any alternative business
strategies that might exist for Cambridge or the effect of any other
transaction in which Cambridge might engage.
Salomon Smith Barney's opinion
necessarily was based on information available to it and financial, stock
market and other conditions and circumstances existing and disclosed to it as
of the date of its opinion.

   
Salomon Smith Barney's advisory services and opinion were provided for the
information of Cambridge's board of directors in its evaluation of the proposed
merger and does not constitute a recommendation of the merger to Cambridge or
its stockholders, nor does it constitute a recommendation to any stockholder as
to how such stockholder should vote on any matter relating to the merger.

   
In connection with rendering its opinion, Salomon Smith Barney made a
presentation to the Cambridge board of directors on March 12, 2001, with
respect to the material analyses performed by Salomon Smith Barney in
evaluating the fairness of the exchange ratio.
The following is a summary of
that presentation.
The summary includes information presented in tabular
format.
In order to understand fully the financial analyses used by Salomon
Smith Barney, these tables must be read together with the text of each summary.

The tables alone do not constitute a complete description of the financial
analyses.
The following quantitative information, to the extent it is based on
market data, is, except as otherwise indicated, based on market data as it
existed at or prior to March 9, 2001, and is not necessarily indicative of
current or future market conditions.

   
Comparable companies analyses.

   
Salomon Smith Barney compared financial, operating and stock market
information for each of Cambridge and Novell, with the same information for
selected publicly traded companies that operate in the same sectors as each of
Cambridge and Novell.
For Cambridge, Salomon Smith Barney selected the
following comparable companies operating in the systems integrators sector:

  .
CIBER Inc.;

  .
Computer Horizons Corp.;

  .
Covansys;

  .
iGate Capital Corporation;

  .
IMRglobal Corp.;

  .
marchFIRST, Inc.; and

  .
Modis Professional Services, Inc.

Given Novell's mix of products and services, Salomon Smith Barney selected
comparable companies operating in the following three sectors, each of which is
comparable to one of the three major divisions of Novell's operations:

  .
content-delivery products;

  .
information technology services; and

  .
software.

   
The following table sets forth the comparable companies selected by Salomon
Smith Barney in each of those sectors:

      Content-
      Delivery
      Products     IT Services              Software
      --------     -----------              --------

   CACHEFLOW Inc.  INFORTE CORP.            Remedy Corporation
   Digital
    Island, Inc.   Predictive Systems, Inc.
J.D. Edwards & Co.
   INKTOMI
    CORPORATION    Sapient Corporation      Computer Associates International, Inc.

   The forecasted financial information used by Salomon Smith Barney in the
course of its comparable companies analyses was based on research published by
certain investment banks as well as information published by First Call
Corporation.
First Call Corporation compiles summaries of financial forecasts
published by various investment banking firms.
Calculations were made based on
the closing price per share of each company's common stock on March 9, 2001.
In
deriving ratios for the selected comparable companies, Salomon Smith Barney
made certain adjustments to the relevant data to take into account certain
unusual and nonrecurring items.
In each instance, firm value was calculated as
the sum of:

  .
equity value (common shares on a fully diluted basis valued at the
    closing price per share on March 9, 2001, less any proceeds that would be
    received from the exercise of options or conversion of securities); plus

  .
non-convertible indebtedness; plus

  .
minority interests in subsidiaries; plus

  .
non-convertible preferred stock; plus

  .
all out-of-the-money convertible securities; minus

  .
investments in unconsolidated affiliates and cash.

   
For Novell and the selected comparable companies operating in the content-
delivery products, information technology services and software sectors,
Salomon Smith Barney derived and compared, among other things:

  .
the equity value of each company as of March 9, 2001;

  .
the firm value of each company as of March 9, 2001;

  .
the ratio of the closing price per common share of each company on March
    9, 2001, to (a) its estimated earnings per share (EPS) for 2000, and (b)
    its estimated EPS for 2001;

  .
the estimated revenue growth rate of each company for 2001;

  .
the five year estimated EPS growth rate of each company; and

  .
the ratio of each company's firm value to (a) its estimated revenue for
    2000, and (b) its estimated revenue for 2001.

   
The following tables sets forth the results of these analyses for each of
the three sectors selected by Salomon Smith Barney:

   Based on these data, Salomon Smith Barney derived the following ranges for
the implied firm value of each of Novell's three major divisions as a multiple
of estimated 2001 revenues (i) 0.9x to 1.4x for Novell's Net Directory Services
operations which Salomon Smith Barney considered comparable to the selected
software companies, (ii) 0.8x to 1.2x for Novell's Content Services operations
which Salomon Smith Barney considered comparable to the selected content-
delivery products companies, and (iii) 0.3x to 0.5x for Novell's Customer
Services operations which Salomon Smith Barney considered comparable to the
selected information technology companies.
Using estimates of 2001 revenue for
each of Novell's three major divisions based on information research published
by certain investment banks as well as Novell management estimates, Salomon
Smith Barney derived a range for Novell's implied firm value of $2,019 million
to $2,493 million and a range for the implied equity value per share of Novell
common stock of $6.27 to $7.75.
Using the range derived for the implied equity
value per share of Novell common stock and the exchange ratio in the merger of
0.668, Salomon Smith Barney further derived a range of the implied price per
share of Cambridge common stock in the merger of $4.19 to $5.18.

   
For Cambridge and the selected comparable companies operating in the systems
integrators sector, Salomon Smith Barney derived and compared, among other
things:

  .
the equity value of each company as of March 9, 2001;

  .
the ratio of the closing price per common share of each company on March
    9, 2001, to its estimated EPS for 2000, and its estimated EPS for 2001;

  .
the five year estimated EPS growth rate of each company;

  .
the firm value of each company as of March 9, 2001;

  .
the ratio of each company's firm value to its revenue for the twelve-
    month period ended September 30, 2000, its estimated revenue for 2000,
    and its estimated revenue for 2001; and

  .
each company's twelve month margins for the period ended September 30,
    2000, including gross profits, and earnings before interest expense,
    taxes, depreciation and amortization ("EBITDA").

   Based on these data, Salomon Smith Barney derived the following ranges for
Cambridge's implied firm value as a multiple of estimated revenue: (i) 0.4x to
0.5x estimated 2000 revenue and (ii) 0.3x to 0.4x estimated 2001 revenue.
Using
estimates of 2000 revenue and 2001 revenue based on information contained in
Salomon Smith Barney research reports, Salomon Smith Barney derived a range for
Cambridge's implied firm value of $190 million to $230 million, and a range for
the implied equity value per share of Cambridge common stock of $2.90 to $3.50.

Salomon Smith Barney noted that the lower limit of the range derived for the
implied price per share of Cambridge common stock in the merger ($4.19 to
$5.18, as described above) was above the upper limit of the range derived for
the implied equity value per share of Cambridge common stock using the
comparable companies analysis.
Salomon Smith Barney also derived a range of
$3.50 to $4.80 for the implied equity value per share of Cambridge common stock
based upon an assumed control premium of approximately 25% to 35% over the
equity value per share of Cambridge common stock implied by the comparable
companies analysis.
Salomon Smith Barney noted that the range of the implied
price per share of Cambridge common stock in the merger of $4.19 to $5.18 was
within or above this range.

   
Precedent transaction and premium analyses.

   
Salomon Smith Barney reviewed publicly available information for the
following eight acquisition transactions involving public companies in the
information technology services sector:

   
Announcement Date   Acquiror                      Acquired Company
   -----------------   --------

                        Corporation
   June 20, 2000       Commerce One Inc.             AppNet Inc.
   March 22, 2000

   December 29, 1999   Leapnet Inc.                  SPR Inc.

   For each precedent transaction, Salomon Smith Barney derived:

  .
the premium based on the consideration paid or proposed to be paid in the
    transaction over the firm value of the acquired company (a) one day prior
    to announcement of the transaction, and (b) 60 days prior to announcement
    of the transaction; and

  .
the ratio of the firm value of the acquired company based on the
    consideration paid or proposed to be paid in the transaction to the (a)
    revenue of the acquired company, (b) estimated earning before interest
    expenses and taxes (EBIT) of the acquired company, and (c) EBITDA of the
    acquired company, in each case, for the last twelve-month period ending
    prior to the announcement of the transaction for which financial results
    were available.

   
With respect to the financial information for the companies involved in the
precedent transactions, Salomon Smith Barney relied on information provided by
Securities Data Corporation as well as information available in public
documents.
Securities Data Corporation compiles summaries of merger and
financing information published by certain investment banks, market research
firms and trade associations.
In evaluating the data for the precedent
transactions, Salomon Smith Barney took into consideration changes in market
conditions that have occurred since the time certain precedent transactions
were announced.
Salomon Smith Barney also noted that most of the precedent
transactions involved target companies that, unlike Cambridge, had positive
EBITDA for the twelve-month period prior to the announcement of the
transaction.
The following table sets forth the results of these analyses:

                                                        Range     Median  Mean
                                                        -----     ------

  60-days prior to announcement....................

Ratio of Firm Value of Acquired Company to:
  Revenue for the 12-month period prior to
   announcement....................................    0.1x-4.8x   1.3x    1.7x
  Estimated EBIT for the 12-month period prior to

  Estimated EBITDA for the 12-month period prior to
   announcement....................................    
7.7x-53.1x  9.3x   25.0x

   Based on these data, Salomon Smith Barney derived a range for Cambridge's
implied firm value as a multiple of revenue for the last twelve-month period
ending prior to the announcement of the transaction of 0.4x to 0.8x.
Based on
Cambridge's revenue for the last twelve-month period ending prior to the
announcement of the merger, Salomon Smith Barney derived a range for
Cambridge's implied firm value of $230 million to $470 million, and a range for
the implied equity value per share of Cambridge common stock of $3.50 to $7.20.

Salomon Smith Barney noted that the range of the implied price per share of
Cambridge common stock in the merger ($4.19 to $5.18, as described above) was
within the range derived for the implied equity value per share of Cambridge
common stock using the precedent transactions analysis.

   
Salomon Smith Barney also derived the implied premium represented by the
exchange ratio in the merger over the exchange ratio implied by dividing (i)
the closing price per share of Cambridge common stock by the closing price per
share of Novell common stock as of March 9, 2001; (ii) the average of the
closing prices per share of Cambridge common stock by the average of the
closing prices per share of Novell common stock for the 30-day period ended
March 9, 2001; and (iii) the average of the closing prices per share of
Cambridge common stock by the average of the closing prices per share of Novell
common stock for the 60-day period ended March 9, 2001.
The following table
sets forth the results of these analyses:

           Period                    Exchange Ratio                       Implied Premium
           ------                    --------------                       
---------------

     As of March 9, 2001                 0.546x                                22.3%
     30-day average                      0.472x                                41.4%
     60-day average                      0.427x                                56.5%

   Salomon Smith Barney noted that these implied premiums are above or in-line
with the median premiums derived for the precedent transactions.

   
Accretion/dilution analysis.

   
Salomon Smith Barney performed an analysis of the estimated impact of the
merger on Novell's estimated cash EPS for 2001 pro forma for a combination
effected on January 1, 2001.
EPS estimates were based on information published
by First Call Corporation.
In performing this analysis, Salomon Smith Barney
did not take into account any projected cost-savings or other synergies
anticipated to result from the merger.
The following table shows the
accretion/dilution to the estimated 2001 cash EPS of Novell expected to result
from the merger:

     Cambridge stand-alone............................................. $(0.20)
     
Novell stand-alone................................................ $ 0.24
     Combined entity pro-forma......................................... $ 0.18
     Accretion/Dilution to Novell...................................... $(0.06)

   Salomon Smith Barney noted that the merger will be dilutive to Novell's cash
EPS in 2001 pro forma for a combination effected on January 1, 2001 unless the
merger results in synergies of at least $37.9 million.

   
The preceding discussion is a summary of the material financial analyses
furnished by Salomon Smith Barney to the Cambridge board of directors, but it
does not purport to be a complete description of the analyses performed by
Salomon Smith Barney or of its presentation to the Cambridge board of
directors.
The preparation of financial analyses and fairness opinions is a
complex process involving subjective judgments and is not necessarily
susceptible to partial analysis or summary description.
Salomon Smith Barney
made no attempt to assign specific weights to particular analyses or factors
considered, but rather made qualitative judgments as to the significance and
relevance of all the analyses and factors considered and determined to give its
fairness opinion as described above.
Accordingly, Salomon Smith Barney believes
that its analyses, and the summary set forth above, must be considered as a
whole, and that selecting portions of the analyses and of the factors
considered by Salomon Smith Barney, without considering all of the analyses and
factors, could create a misleading or incomplete view of the processes
underlying the analyses conducted by Salomon Smith Barney and its opinion.
With
regard to the comparable companies and precedent transaction analyses
summarized above, Salomon Smith Barney selected comparable public companies and
precedent transactions on the basis of various factors, including size and
similarity of line of business; however, no company utilized in these analyses
is identical to Cambridge or Novell and no precedent transaction is identical
to the merger.
As a result, these analyses are not purely mathematical, but
also take into account differences in financial and operating characteristics
of the subject companies and other factors that could affect the transaction or
public trading value of the subject companies to which Cambridge and Novell are
being compared.
In its analyses, Salomon Smith Barney made numerous assumptions
with respect to Cambridge, Novell, industry performance, general business,
economic, market and financial conditions and other matters, many of which are
beyond the control of Cambridge and Novell.
Any estimates contained in Salomon
Smith Barney's analyses are not necessarily indicative of actual values or
predictive of future results or values, which may be significantly more or less
favorable than those suggested by these analyses.
Estimates of values of
companies do not purport to be appraisals or necessarily to reflect the prices
at which companies may actually be sold.
Because these estimates are inherently
subject to uncertainty, none of Cambridge, Novell, the Cambridge board of
directors, the Novell board of directors, Salomon Smith Barney or any other
person assumes responsibility if future results or actual values differ
materially from the estimates.
Salomon Smith Barney's analyses were prepared
solely as part of Salomon Smith Barney's analysis of the fairness of the
exchange ratio in the merger and were provided to the Cambridge board of
directors in that connection.
The opinion of Salomon Smith Barney was only one
of the factors taken into consideration by the Cambridge board of directors in
making its determination to approve the merger agreement and the merger.
Please
see the section entitled "Recommendation of, and factors considered by, the
Cambridge board of directors" on page 30 of this proxy statement-prospectus.

   
Salomon Smith Barney is an internationally recognized investment banking
firm engaged in, among other things, the valuation of businesses and their
securities in connection with mergers and acquisitions, restructurings,
leveraged buyouts, negotiated underwritings, competitive biddings, secondary
distributions of

listed and unlisted securities, private placements and valuations for estate,
corporate and other purposes.
Cambridge selected Salomon Smith Barney to act as
its financial advisor on the basis of Salomon Smith Barney's international
reputation and Salomon Smith Barney's familiarity with Cambridge.
Salomon Smith
Barney and its predecessors and affiliates have previously provided and
currently are providing investment banking services to Cambridge unrelated to
the merger, for which Salomon Smith Barney has received and will receive
compensation.
In the ordinary course of its business, Salomon Smith Barney and
its affiliates may actively trade or hold the securities of both Cambridge and
Novell for its own account and for the account of customers and, accordingly,
may at any time hold a long or short position in those securities.
Salomon
Smith Barney and its affiliates, including Citigroup Inc. and its affiliates,
may maintain relationships with Cambridge and Novell and their respective
affiliates.

   
Pursuant to Salomon Smith Barney's engagement letter, Cambridge agreed to
pay Salomon Smith Barney the following fees for its services rendered in
connection with the merger: (i) $1,000,000, that became payable upon delivery
of Salomon Smith Barney's fairness opinion, (ii) a fee based on the aggregate
consideration received by the holders of Cambridge common stock in the
transaction, ranging from .3% to 2.175% of the value of the transaction and
(iii) 10% of any termination, break-up or similar fee, payable upon receipt of
any such fee by Cambridge.
Cambridge has also agreed to reimburse Salomon Smith
Barney for its reasonable travel and other out-of-pocket expenses incurred in
connection with its engagement, including the reasonable fees and expenses of
its counsel, and to indemnify Salomon Smith Barney against specific liabilities
and expenses relating to or arising out of its engagement, including
liabilities under the federal securities laws.


Interests of Cambridge directors and officers in the merger

   When considering the recommendation of Cambridge's board of directors, you
should be aware that Cambridge directors and executive officers have interests
in the merger that are different from, or are in addition to, yours.
The
Cambridge board of directors was aware of these potential conflicts and
considered them in making their recommendation.

   
Jack L. Messman

   Jack L. Messman, the president, chief executive officer and a director of
Cambridge, will enter into an employment agreement with Novell.
Mr. Messman's
employment agreement will provide for his employment as chief executive officer
and president of Novell.

   
Other key executives and directors

   Most Cambridge executive officers are to receive equity grants and employee
benefits in connection with their employment with Novell after the completion
of the merger.
These executives will be employed by Novell in comparable
positions and at base salaries and incentive compensation that are at least
equal to the cash base salaries and incentive compensation that they currently
receive, or are eligible to receive, from Cambridge.
These Cambridge executive
officers will also participate in the Novell Senior Management Severance Plan.

   
As a condition to obtaining employment with Novell effective at the closing,
Cambridge executives have waived or are expected to waive, the provisions of
their existing change-in-control agreements with Cambridge which would be
triggered by the consummation of the merger.

   
Cambridge executives who are not expected to be employed by Novell have not
waived the provisions of their existing change-in-control agreements.
These
executives are entitled to severance payments aggregating approximately $5.2
million under their Cambridge change-in-control agreements.
In addition, these
executives will receive stock option grants from Novell for an aggregate of
approximately 351,000 shares following the merger.

   
In addition, Cambridge's directors and officers will receive, for a period
of six years after the completion of the merger, directors and officers
insurance coverage with terms substantially the same as those of Cambridge's
existing directors and officers insurance policy for events occurring on or
prior to the completion of the merger through one of the following mechanisms:

  .  
a directors and officers insurance policy whose annual premium is not
     greater than 150% of the premium of Cambridge's policy in effect on the
     date of the merger agreement, or

  .  
obtaining six-year "tail" coverage under Cambridge's existing directors
     and officers insurance policy.

   
Cambridge nominated directors

   In addition, as a condition to closing, two Cambridge directors selected by
Cambridge in addition to Mr. Messman, will become directors of Novell's board
of directors effective upon consummation of the merger.

Exchange of Cambridge stock certificates for Novell stock certificates

   When the merger is completed, the exchange agent will mail to you a letter
of transmittal and instructions for surrendering your Cambridge stock
certificates in exchange for Novell stock certificates.
When you deliver your
Cambridge stock certificates to the exchange agent along with an executed
letter of transmittal and any other required documents, your Cambridge stock
certificates will be canceled and you will receive Novell stock certificates
representing the number of full shares of Novell common stock to which you are
entitled under the merger agreement.
You will not receive any fractional shares
of Novell common stock in the merger, but will instead receive cash equal to
your proportionate interest of the net proceeds from the sale of the aggregate
fractional shares on the Nasdaq National Market by the exchange agent on your
behalf of the aggregate fractional shares.
Alternatively, Novell may, at its
election, have the exchange agent pay you cash equal to the market value of the
fractional shares.
In this case, the market value of the fractional shares
would be based on the average closing price of Novell common stock for the five
trading days ending on the trading day immediately prior to the closing of the
merger.


You should not submit your Cambridge stock certificates for exchange until you
receive your instructions and a form of letter of transmittal from the exchange
agent

   You are not entitled to receive any dividends or other distributions on
Novell common stock until the merger is completed and you have surrendered your
Cambridge stock certificates in exchange for Novell stock certificates.
Subject
to the effect of applicable laws, you will receive payment for any dividend or
other distribution on Novell common stock with a record date after the merger
and a payment date prior to the date you surrender your Cambridge stock
certificates promptly after your Novell stock certificates are issued.
You will
receive payment for any dividend or other distribution on Novell common stock
with a record date after the merger and a payment date after the date you
surrender your Cambridge stock certificates promptly after the payment date.

   
Novell will only issue you a Novell stock certificate and/or a check in lieu
of a fractional share in a name other than the name in which a surrendered
Cambridge stock certificate is registered if you present the exchange agent
with all documents required to show and effect the unrecorded transfer of
ownership and show that you paid any applicable stock transfer taxes.
If your
Cambridge stock certificate has been lost, stolen or destroyed, you may need to
deliver an affidavit and bond prior to receiving your Novell stock certificate.


Material U.S. federal income tax consequences of the merger

   
The following are the material U.S. federal income tax consequences of the
merger to holders of Cambridge common stock who, pursuant to the merger,
exchange their Cambridge common stock for Novell common stock, assuming that
the merger is effected as described in the merger agreement and in this proxy
statement-prospectus.
This discussion is based on existing provisions of the
Internal Revenue Code, existing and proposed Treasury regulations, and current
administrative rulings and court decisions, all of which are subject to change,
possibly with retroactive effect.
This discussion is also based on and subject
to certain assumptions, limitations, representations and covenants, including
those contained in certificates of officers of Novell, Cambridge, and Ceres
Neptune Acquisition Corp.

   
This discussion does not address all U.S. federal income tax considerations
that may be relevant to you in light of your particular circumstances.
Factors
that could alter the tax consequences of the merger to you include:

  .
if you are a dealer or trader in securities;

  .
if you are subject to the alternative minimum tax provisions of the
    Internal Revenue Code;

  .
if you are not a U.S. citizen or resident;

  .
if you are a tax-exempt organization, financial institution or insurance
    company;

  .
if you acquired your shares in connection with stock option or stock
    purchase plans or in other compensatory transactions; or

  .
if you hold Cambridge common stock as part of a hedge, straddle, or other
    integrated, risk reduction, constructive sale, or conversion transaction.

   
This discussion does not address the tax consequences of an exchange of
options or warrants for Cambridge common stock into options or warrants for
Novell common stock.
This discussion assumes you hold your shares of Cambridge
common stock as capital assets within the meaning of Section 1221 of the
Internal Revenue Code.

   
Novell's and Cambridge's obligations to complete the merger are conditioned
upon Novell's receipt of an opinion dated as of the closing of the merger from
Wilson Sonsini and Cambridge's receipt of an opinion dated as of the closing of
the merger from Morgan Lewis, that the merger will constitute a reorganization
within the

meaning of Section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code.
These opinions will be
based upon then-existing law and will rely on certain facts, assumptions,
limitations, representations and covenants including those contained in
certificates executed by officers of Novell, Cambridge and Ceres Neptune
Acquisition Corp. that, if incorrect in certain material respects, would
jeopardize the conclusions reached by Wilson Sonsini and Morgan Lewis in their
opinions.
The tax opinions will not bind the Internal Revenue Service or the
courts or prevent the Internal Revenue Service from successfully asserting a
contrary opinion.
Neither Novell nor Cambridge will request a ruling from the
Internal Revenue Service in connection with the merger.

   
The following material federal income tax consequences will result from the
merger's qualification as a reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a)
of the Internal Revenue Code:

  .
You will not recognize any gain or loss upon your receipt of Novell
    common stock in the merger, except with respect to cash received instead
    of a fractional share of Novell common stock.

  .
The aggregate tax basis of the Novell common stock received by you as a
    result of the merger (treating fractional share interests in Novell
    common stock as having been issued in the merger and then redeemed for
    cash) will be the same as the aggregate tax basis of the Cambridge common
    stock you surrender in the merger.

  .
The holding period of the Novell common stock received by you in the
    merger will include the period during which you held the Cambridge common
    stock exchanged therefor.

  .
None of Novell, Ceres Neptune Acquisition Corp., or Cambridge will
    recognize gain or loss solely as a result of the merger.

   
If you receive cash in the merger instead of a fractional share interest in
Novell common stock, you will be treated as having received the cash in
redemption of the fractional share interest.
Assuming that, immediately after
the merger, you hold a minimal interest in Novell, you exercise no control over
Novell and, as a result of the deemed redemption and after giving effect to
certain constructive ownership rules, you experience an actual reduction in
your interest in Novell, you will recognize capital gain or loss on the deemed
redemption in an amount equal to the difference between the amount of cash
received and your adjusted tax basis allocable to such fractional share.

Otherwise, the cash payment may be taxable to you as a dividend.
Any such
capital gain or loss will be long-term capital gain or loss if your holding
period for your Cambridge common stock is greater than 12 months at the time of
the merger.

   
If the Internal Revenue Service were to successfully challenge the status of
the merger as a reorganization, the tax consequences to you described above
would not, in general, apply.
In such event, you would be required to recognize
gain or loss as a result of the merger in an amount equal to the difference
between your basis in your Cambridge common stock and the fair market value, as
of the closing of the merger, of the shares of Novell common stock and any
other consideration that you receive.

   
Even if the merger qualifies as a reorganization, you could recognize gain
to the extent that shares of Novell common stock are considered to be received
in exchange for services or property, other than solely for Cambridge common
stock.
All or a portion of such gain may be taxable as ordinary income.
You may
also recognize gain to the extent that you are treated as receiving, directly
or indirectly, consideration other than Novell common stock in exchange for
your Cambridge common stock.

   
The foregoing discussion is not intended to be a complete analysis or
description of all potential United States federal income tax consequences of
the merger.
In particular, the discussion does not address tax consequences
which may vary with your individual circumstances.
Moreover, the discussion
does not address any non-income tax or any foreign, state or local tax
consequences of the merger.
Accordingly, we strongly urge you to consult your
own tax advisor as to the specific United States federal, state, local or
foreign income or other tax consequences of the merger to you.


Accounting treatment of the merger

   Novell intends to account for the merger as a purchase transaction.


Regulatory filings and approvals required to complete the merger

   
The merger is subject to the requirements of the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust
Improvements Act of 1976, as amended, under which a transaction cannot be
completed until required information and materials are furnished to the
Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice and the United States Federal
Trade Commission and the applicable waiting periods are terminated or expire.

Novell and Cambridge have made the required filings with the Department of
Justice and the United States Federal Trade Commission, but the applicable
waiting periods have not yet been terminated or expired.

   
The Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice or the United States
Federal Trade Commission may challenge the merger on antitrust grounds either
before or after expiration of the waiting period.
Accordingly, at any time
before or after the completion of the merger, either the Antitrust Division of
the Department of Justice or the United States Federal Trade Commission could
take action under the antitrust laws as it deems necessary or desirable in the
public interest.
Other persons could also take action under the antitrust laws,
including seeking to enjoin the merger.
Additionally, at any time before or
after the completion of the merger, whether or not the applicable waiting
period expired or ended, any state could take action under the antitrust laws
as it deems necessary or desirable in the public interest.
There can be no
assurance that a challenge to the merger will not be made or that, if a
challenge is made, we will prevail.

   
In addition, Novell and Cambridge must file any applicable competition
filings in foreign jurisdictions and receive clearance prior to completing the
merger.

   
Other than as described above, neither Novell nor Cambridge is aware of any
other material governmental or regulatory approval required for completion of
the merger, other than the effectiveness of this registration statement of
which this proxy statement-prospectus forms a part and compliance with
applicable corporate laws of Delaware.


Restrictions on sales of shares by affiliates of Cambridge and Novell

   The shares of Novell common stock to be issued in connection with the merger
will be registered under the Securities Act and will be freely transferable
under the Securities Act, except for shares of Novell common stock issued to
any person who is deemed to be an "affiliate" of either Novell or Cambridge.

Persons who may be deemed affiliates include individuals or entities that
control, are controlled by, or are under common control with such other person
and may include some of our executive officers and directors, as well as our
respective principal stockholders.
Affiliates may not sell their shares of
Novell common stock acquired in connection with the merger except pursuant to:

  .
an effective registration statement under the Securities Act covering the
    resale of those shares;

  .
an exemption under paragraph (d) of Rule 145 under the Securities Act; or

  .
any other applicable exemption under the Securities Act.

   
Novell's registration statement on Form S-4, of which this proxy statement-
prospectus forms a part, does not cover the resale of shares of Novell common
stock to be received by Novell and Cambridge affiliates in the merger.

similar matters.
No fractional shares of Novell common stock will be issued in
the merger.
Instead, each holder of fractional shares will receive an amount of
cash equal to such holder's proportionate interest in the net proceeds from the
sale by the exchange agent in one or more transactions on behalf of all holders
of fractional shares of Novell.
The merger agreement provides that all options
outstanding at the closing of the merger to purchase shares of Cambridge common
stock will be assumed by Novell and become options to purchase common stock of
Novell, subject to adjustment according to the exchange ratio.
It is expected
that all unexercised options to acquire Cambridge common stock will be
cancelled upon the closing of the merger.
For a description of equity grants to
be made to Cambridge employees following the merger, see the discussion on
pages 41 through 43 of this proxy statement-prospectus.

Novell common stock to be issued in the merger.

Regulatory filings

   The merger agreement contains various covenants and agreements regarding
preparation of regulatory filings that are customary in transactions of this
nature, including:

  .
Novell and Cambridge have agreed to prepare and cause to be filed with
    the Securities and Exchange Commission a registration statement on Form
    S-4, including this proxy statement-prospectus, and to cooperate and
    promptly provide information to each other as required or appropriate for
    inclusion in the registration statement;

  .
Novell and Cambridge have agreed to respond to any comments of the staff
    of the Securities and Exchange Commission and to use commercially
    reasonable efforts to have the registration statement on Form S-4
    declared effective under the Securities Act as promptly as practicable
    after it is filed;

  .
Cambridge has agreed to cause this proxy statement-prospectus to be
    mailed out to its stockholders at the earliest practicable time after the
    S-4 is declared effective;

  .
Novell and Cambridge have agreed to prepare and file any other filings
    relating to the merger required to be filed under applicable law;

  .
Novell and Cambridge have agreed to notify each other promptly upon
    receipt of any comments or requests for information regarding the filings
    from the Securities and Exchange Commission or other regulatory bodies;

  .
Novell and Cambridge have agreed to notify each other of any event that

  .
Cambridge has agreed to cause this proxy statement-prospectus to include
    the recommendation of its board of directors in favor of adoption and
    approval of the merger agreement and approval of the merger, subject to
    specified exceptions.


Special meeting of Cambridge stockholders

   Cambridge has agreed to convene a special meeting of Cambridge stockholders
as promptly as practicable after the registration statement on Form S-4 is
declared effective, and, unless Cambridge's board of directors has withdrawn
its recommendation of the merger agreement and the merger, to use its
commercially reasonable efforts to solicit and secure from its stockholders at
the meeting the adoption and approval of the merger agreement and the merger.

Cambridge has also agreed that its board of directors will recommend that its
stockholders vote in favor of and adopt and approve the merger agreement and
the merger, and that this recommendation will not be withdrawn or modified in a
manner adverse to Novell, subject to specified exceptions.

   
Nothing in the merger agreement prevents the Cambridge board of directors
from withdrawing or changing its recommendation in favor of the merger if the
board reasonably concludes in good faith, after consultation with its outside
counsel, that the failure to so withdraw or change its recommendation would be
inconsistent with its fiduciary obligations.


Non-solicitation by Cambridge

   Cambridge has agreed to cease, as of the date of the merger agreement, any
and all existing activities, discussions or negotiations with any parties
conducted prior to that date with respect to any "Acquisition Proposal," that
is, an offer or proposal relating to any "Acquisition Transaction," other than
an offer or proposal from Novell.

   
An Acquisition Transaction is any transaction or series of related
transactions, other than the merger, involving any of the following:

  .
the acquisition or purchase from Cambridge by any person or group of more
    than a 15% interest in the total outstanding voting securities of
    Cambridge or any of its subsidiaries;

  .
any tender offer or exchange offer that if consummated would result in
    any person or group beneficially owning 15% or more of the total
    outstanding voting securities of Cambridge or any of its subsidiaries;

  .
any merger, consolidation, business combination or similar transaction
    involving Cambridge pursuant to which the stockholders of Cambridge
    immediately preceding such transaction hold less than 85% of the equity
    interests in the surviving or resulting entity;

  .
any sale, lease outside the ordinary course of business, exchange,
    transfer, license outside the ordinary course of business, acquisition or
    disposition of more than 15% of the assets of Cambridge; or

  .
any liquidation or dissolution of Cambridge.

   
Until the merger is completed or the merger agreement is terminated,
Cambridge has agreed that neither it nor any of its subsidiaries will, directly
or indirectly:

  .
solicit, initiate, encourage or induce the making, submission or
    announcement of any Acquisition Proposal;

  .
participate in any discussions or negotiations regarding any Acquisition
    Proposal;

  .
furnish to any person any non-public information with respect to any
    Acquisition Proposal;

  .
take any other action to facilitate any inquiries or the making of any
    proposal that constitutes or may reasonably be expected to lead to any
    Acquisition Proposal;

  .
engage in discussions with any person with respect to any Acquisition
    Proposal;

  .
subject to certain limited exceptions in the event of a "Superior Offer,"
    as discussed below, approve, endorse or recommend any Acquisition
    Proposal; or

  .
enter into any letter of intent or similar document or any contract,
    agreement or commitment contemplating or otherwise relating to any
    Acquisition Transaction.

   
For purposes of the foregoing, any violation of any of the restrictions in
the immediately preceding paragraph by any officer, director, affiliate or
employee of Cambridge or any investment banker, attorney or other advisor or
representative of Cambridge is deemed to be a breach of the relevant
restriction by Cambridge.

   
A Superior Offer is an unsolicited, bona fide written offer made by a third
party to consummate any of the following transactions on terms that the board
of directors of Cambridge determines, in its reasonable judgment, after
consultation regarding the offer with its outside financial advisor, to be more
favorable to Cambridge stockholders than the terms of the merger involving
Novell:

  .
a merger, consolidation, business combination, recapitalization,
    liquidation, dissolution or similar transaction involving Cambridge
    pursuant to which the stockholders of Cambridge immediately preceding the
    transaction hold less than 51% of the equity interest in the surviving or
    resulting entity of the transaction;

  .
a sale or other disposition by Cambridge of all or substantially all of
    its assets; or

  .
the acquisition by any person or group, including by way of a tender
    offer or an exchange offer or issuance by Cambridge, directly or
    indirectly, of beneficial ownership or a right to acquire beneficial
    ownership of shares representing in excess of 51% of the voting power of
    the then outstanding shares of capital stock of Cambridge.

   
However, an offer will not be considered a Superior Offer if any financing
required to consummate the transaction contemplated by such offer is not
committed or is not likely in the judgment of Cambridge's board of directors to
be obtained by such third party on a timely basis.

   
The merger agreement provides that these restrictions shall not prohibit
Cambridge from complying with Rule 14e-2 promulgated under the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.
Moreover, the merger agreement allows
Cambridge to participate in discussions or negotiations with, or furnish
information regarding Cambridge pursuant to a confidentiality agreement to, any
person or group if all of the following conditions are met:

  .  
the person or group has submitted a Superior Offer to Cambridge's board
     of directors;

  .  
neither Cambridge nor any of its representatives or subsidiaries has
     breached the non-solicitation provisions contained in the merger
     agreement in connection with the Superior Offer;

  .  
the board of directors of Cambridge determines in its good faith
     judgment, after consultation with its outside legal counsel, that
     failure to take such action would be inconsistent with its fiduciary
     duties under applicable law;

  .  
the board of directors of Cambridge provides prior written notice to
     Novell of its decision to participate in negotiations and provide
     information; and

  .  
Cambridge contemporaneously provides any information provided the person
     or group to Novell (to the extent such information has not been
     previously furnished).

   
Cambridge has agreed to promptly inform Novell of any request for non-public
information that Cambridge reasonably believes would lead to an Acquisition
Proposal, or of any Acquisition Proposal, or any

inquiry with respect to or which Cambridge reasonably should believe would lead
to any Acquisition Proposal, the material terms and conditions of such request,
Acquisition Proposal or inquiry, and the identity of the person or group making
any such request, Acquisition Proposal or inquiry.

   
Under the merger agreement, the Cambridge directors are allowed to withhold,
withdraw, amend or modify their recommendation in favor of the merger if a
Superior Offer is made and not withdrawn, neither Cambridge nor any of its
representatives has breached the non-solicitation provisions of the merger
agreement in connection with the Superior Offer, and the board of directors of
Cambridge reasonably concludes in good faith, after consultation with its
outside counsel that, in light of the Superior Offer, the failure to withhold,
withdraw, amend or modify its recommendation would be inconsistent with the
directors' fiduciary obligations to Cambridge stockholders under applicable
law.

   
Regardless of whether there has been a Superior Offer, Cambridge is
obligated under the merger agreement to hold and convene the Cambridge special
meeting of stockholders.


Treatment of Cambridge stock options and contingent obligation to issue shares

   It is expected that all unexercised Cambridge options will be cancelled
prior to or upon the closing of the merger.
For a discussion of equity grants
to be made to Cambridge employees following the merger, see the discussion on
pages 41 through 43 of this proxy statement-prospectus.

   
Cambridge's contingent obligation to issue shares of its common stock
pursuant to an earn-out agreement entered into in connection with Cambridge's
purchase of the business and assets of OSIX PTY Ltd. will be assumed by Novell
and become a contingent obligation to issue Novell common stock with a fair
value of up to two million Australian dollars if the earn-out conditions are
met.


Cambridge's employee benefit plans

   Following the merger and for one year thereafter, Novell will provide
Cambridge employees and its subsidiaries' employees with:

  .  substantially similar compensation, employee benefits and terms and
     conditions of employment, in the aggregate, as Novell provides to
     similarly situated employees of Novell;

  .  
compensation, employee benefits and terms and conditions of employment
     that are substantially similar, in the aggregate, to those of Cambridge
     as in effect immediately prior to the merger; or

  .  
a combination of the two above alternatives, provided that compensation,
     employee benefits and terms and conditions of employment, in the
     aggregate, are substantially similar to those in effect for the
     Cambridge employees immediately prior to the merger.

   
Following the merger, each continuing employee will, to the extent permitted
by applicable law, receive service credit for purposes of eligibility to
participate and vesting (but not for benefit accrual purposes) for employment,
compensation and employee benefit plan purposes with Cambridge or its
subsidiaries prior to the merger.


Indemnification

   After completion of the merger, Novell will fulfill the obligations of
Cambridge pursuant to any indemnification provisions under Cambridge's
certificate of incorporation and bylaws and any indemnification agreements
between Cambridge and its directors and officers in effect immediately prior to
the completion of the merger.

   
In addition, Cambridge's directors and officers will receive, for a period
of six years after the completion of the merger, directors and officers
insurance coverage with terms substantially the same as those of Cambridge's
existing directors and officers insurance policy for events occurring on or
prior to the completion of the merger through one of the following mechanisms:

  .  
a directors and officers insurance policy whose annual premium is not
     greater than 150% of the premium of Cambridge's policy in effect on the
     date of the merger agreement; or

  .  
obtaining six-year "tail" coverage under Cambridge's existing directors
     and officers insurance policy.

   The obligations of Novell and Cambridge to complete the merger and the other
transactions contemplated by the merger agreement are subject to the

  .  
all applicable waiting periods under applicable antitrust laws must have
     expired or been terminated; and

  .

     an opinion to the effect that the merger will constitute a
     reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Internal
     Revenue Code, and such opinions shall not have been withdrawn.

   
Cambridge's obligations to complete the merger and the other transactions
contemplated by the merger agreement are subject to the satisfaction or waiver
of each of the following additional conditions before completion of the merger:

  .  
Novell's representations and warranties must be true and correct in all
     material respects as of March 12, 2001, and as of the date the merger is
     to be completed as if made at and as of such time except: to the extent
     Novell's representations and warranties address matters only as of a
     particular date, they must be true and correct as of that date and if
     any of these representations and warranties are not true and correct at
     the time of the merger, but the effect in each case, or in the
     aggregate, while disregarding all qualifications based on the word
     "material" within the representations and warranties, of the
     inaccuracies of these representations and breaches of these warranties,
     is not and does not have a material adverse effect on Novell, then this
     condition will be deemed satisfied;

  .  
Novell must perform or comply in all material respects with all of its
     agreements and covenants required by the merger agreement to be
     performed or complied with by Novell at or before completion of the
     merger;

  .  
the shares of Novell common stock to be issued in the merger must be
     authorized for listing on Nasdaq, subject to notice of issuance;

  .  
Novell shall have offered Jack L. Messman the positions of president and

     merger on terms substantially similar to those of Mr. Messman's current
     employment agreement with Cambridge.

   
Novell's and Ceres Neptune Acquisition Corp.'s obligations to complete the
merger and the other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement are
subject to the satisfaction or waiver of each of the following additional
conditions before completion of the merger:

     to the extent Cambridge's representations and warranties address matters
     only as of a particular date, they must be true and correct as of that
     date and if any of these representations and warranties are not true and
     correct at the time of the merger, but the effect in each case, or in
     the aggregate, while disregarding all qualifications based on the word
     "material" within the representations and warranties, of the
     inaccuracies of these representations and breaches of these warranties
     is not and does not have a material adverse effect on Cambridge, then
     this condition will be deemed satisfied;

  .  
Cambridge must perform or comply in all material respects with all of
     its agreements and covenants required by the merger agreement to be
     performed or complied with by Cambridge at or before completion of the
     merger; and

Mr. Messman shall have accepted and not withdrawn his acceptance of the
     positions of president and chief executive officer of Novell to be

Termination of the merger agreement

   The merger agreement may be terminated at any time prior to completion of
the merger, whether before or after approval and adoption of the merger
agreement and approval of the merger by Cambridge stockholders:

  .  
by mutual consent of Novell and Cambridge;

  .  
by Novell or Cambridge, if the merger is not completed before September
     30, 2001, except that this right to terminate the merger agreement is
     not available to any party whose action or failure to act has been a
     principal cause of or resulted in the failure of the merger to occur on
     or before September 30, 2001 and that action or failure to act
     constitutes a breach of the merger agreement;

  .  
by Novell or Cambridge, if there is any order of a court or governmental
     authority having jurisdiction over either Novell or Cambridge
     permanently restraining, enjoining or prohibiting the completion of the
     merger, which is final and nonappealable;

  .  
by Novell or Cambridge, if the merger fails to receive the requisite
     vote for approval by the stockholders of Cambridge at the Cambridge
     special meeting or at any adjournment of that meeting, except that this
     right to terminate the merger agreement is not available to Novell or
     Cambridge, as the case may be, where the failure to obtain Cambridge
     stockholder approval was caused by Novell's or Cambridge's, as the case
     may be, action or failure to act and this action or failure to act
     constitutes a breach by Novell or Cambridge, as the case may be, of the
     merger agreement;

  .  
by Cambridge, upon a breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or
     agreement on the part of Novell in the merger agreement, or if any
     representation or warranty of Novell is or becomes untrue so that the
     corresponding condition to completion of the merger would not be met;
     however, if the breach or inaccuracy is curable by Novell through the
     exercise of its commercially reasonable efforts, and Novell continues to
     exercise such commercially reasonable efforts, Cambridge may not
     terminate the merger agreement for 30 days after delivery of written
     notice from Cambridge to Novell of the breach;

  .  
by Novell, upon a breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or
     agreement on the part of Cambridge set forth in the merger agreement, or
     if any of Cambridge's representations or warranties is or becomes untrue
     so that the corresponding condition to completion of the merger would
     not be met; however, if the breach or inaccuracy is curable by Cambridge
     through the exercise of its commercially reasonable efforts and
     Cambridge continues to exercise such commercially reasonable efforts,
     Novell may not terminate the merger agreement for 30 days after delivery
     of written notice from Novell to Cambridge of the breach; or

  .  
by Novell if a "Triggering Event" occurs; a Triggering Event is deemed
     to occur if:

   .  
Cambridge's board of directors withdraws or amends or modifies in a
      manner adverse to Novell its recommendation in favor of the adoption
      and approval of the merger agreement or the approval of the merger;

   .  
Cambridge fails to include in this proxy statement-prospectus the
      recommendation of Cambridge's board of directors in favor of the
      adoption and approval of the merger agreement and the approval of the
      merger;

   .  
Cambridge's board of directors fails to reaffirm its recommendation in
      favor of the adoption and approval of the merger agreement and
      approval of the merger within ten business days after Novell requests
      in writing that such recommendation be reaffirmed;

   .  
at any time following the announcement of an Acquisition Proposal,
      Cambridge's board of directors approves or recommends any Acquisition
      Proposal;

   .  
Cambridge violates the non-solicitation provisions of the merger
      agreement; or

   .  
a tender or exchange offer relating to not less than 15% of the then
      outstanding securities of Cambridge is commenced by a person
      unaffiliated with Novell, and Cambridge does not send to its
      securityholders within ten business days after such tender or exchange
      offer is first commenced a statement disclosing that Cambridge
      recommends rejection of such tender or exchange offer.


Payment of termination fee

   If the merger agreement is terminated by Novell because of the occurrence of
a Triggering Event, Cambridge will pay Novell a termination fee of $7.3 million
plus any expenses incurred by Novell in collecting such termination fee, upon
demand by Novell.

   
Further, Cambridge will pay to Novell upon demand by Novell a termination
fee of $7.3 million plus expenses incurred by Novell in collecting such
termination fee, if the merger agreement is terminated by Novell or Cambridge
because the merger is not consummated by September 30, 2001, or because
Cambridge's stockholders do not approve the merger agreement, and either of the
following occur:

  .  
prior to such termination, a third party has delivered an Acquisition
     Proposal and within 12 months following the termination of the merger
     agreement an acquisition of Cambridge is consummated; or

  .  
prior to such termination, a third party has delivered an Acquisition
     Proposal and within 12 months following the termination of the merger
     agreement Cambridge enters into an agreement or letter of intent
     providing for an acquisition of Cambridge.
An acquisition of Cambridge
     for these purposes is any of the following: a merger, consolidation,
     business combination, recapitalization, liquidation, dissolution or
     similar transaction involving Cambridge pursuant to which the
     stockholders of Cambridge immediately preceding such transaction hold
     less than 60% of the aggregate equity interests in the surviving or
     resulting entity of such transaction; or a sale or other disposition by
     Cambridge of assets representing in excess of 60% of the aggregate fair
     market value of Cambridge's business immediately prior to such sale; or
     the acquisition by any person or group, including by way of a tender
     offer or an exchange offer or issuance by Cambridge, directly or
     indirectly, of beneficial ownership or a right to acquire beneficial
     ownership of shares representing in excess of 40% of the voting power of
     the then outstanding shares of capital stock of Cambridge.


Extension, waiver and amendment of the merger agreement

   Novell and Cambridge may amend the merger agreement before completion of the
merger by mutual written consent.
Either Novell or Cambridge may extend the
other's time for the performance of any of the obligations or other acts under
the merger agreement, waive any inaccuracies in the other's representations and
warranties and waive compliance by the other with any of the agreements or
conditions contained in the merger agreement.

                                
OTHER AGREEMENTS

Voting agreements

   As an inducement to Novell to enter into the merger agreement, Jack L.
Messman, the president, chief executive officer and a director of Cambridge,
and other executive officers and directors of Cambridge, entered into voting
agreements with Novell.
By entering into the voting agreements, these Cambridge
stockholders have irrevocably appointed Novell as their lawful attorney and
proxy.
These proxies give Novell the limited right to vote the shares of
Cambridge common stock beneficially owned by these Cambridge stockholders,
including shares of Cambridge common stock acquired after the date of the
voting agreements:

  .  
in favor of the approval and adoption of the merger agreement, the
     merger, each of the other transactions contemplated by the merger
     agreement, any other action required in furtherance of the merger; and

  .  
against any proposal made in opposition to, or in competition with,
     consummation of the merger and the other transactions contemplated by
     the merger agreement; and any merger, asset sale, reorganization,
     recapitalization, dissolution or any other action intended, or which
     could reasonably be expected, to impede, interfere with or otherwise
     adversely affect the consummation of the merger and the other
     transactions contemplated by the merger agreement.

   
These Cambridge stockholders may vote their shares of Cambridge common stock
on all other matters.

   
As of the record date, the Cambridge stockholders who entered into voting
agreements with Novell collectively beneficially owned           shares of
Cambridge common stock which represented approximately    % of the outstanding
Cambridge common stock.
None of the Cambridge stockholders who are parties to
the voting agreements were paid additional consideration in connection with
them.

   
Each Cambridge stockholder who is a party to a voting agreement agreed not
to sell, or transfer voting rights of, the Cambridge stock and options owned,
controlled or acquired, either directly or indirectly, by that person until the
earlier of the completion of the merger or termination of the merger agreement,
unless each person to which any shares, including voting rights or any interest
in any shares is transferred agrees to be bound by the terms and provisions of
the voting agreement, subject to specified exceptions.

   
The Cambridge stockholders' voting agreements will terminate upon the
earlier to occur of the completion of the merger or termination of the merger
agreement.


Affiliate agreements

   As an inducement to Novell to enter into the merger agreement, each member
of the Cambridge board of directors and some officers of Cambridge will execute
affiliate agreements.
Under the affiliate agreements, Novell will be entitled
to place appropriate legends on the certificates evidencing any Novell common
stock to be received by these persons and to issue stop transfer instructions
to the transfer agent for the Novell common stock.
Further, these persons have
also acknowledged the resale restrictions imposed by Rule 145 under the
Securities Act on shares of Novell common stock to be received by them in the
merger.


Employment agreements

   Jack L. Messman, the president, chief executive officer and a director of
Cambridge, is expected to enter into an employment agreement with Novell.

       
NOVELL UNAUDITED PRO FORMA COMBINED CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

   In March 2001, Novell, Inc. entered into a merger agreement with Cambridge
Technology Partners (Massachusetts), Inc. whereby, upon consummation, Cambridge
will become a wholly owned subsidiary of Novell.
Under the merger agreement
each share of Cambridge common stock issued and outstanding immediately prior
to the effective date will be cancelled and converted into the right to receive
0.668 of a share of Novell common stock.
All outstanding stock options of
Cambridge will terminate and Novell will not assume the Cambridge stock option
plans.
As of March 28, 2001, there were 63,532,271 shares of Cambridge common
stock issued and outstanding that will be converted to 42,439,557 shares of
Novell common stock.
The merger will be accounted for using the purchase method
of accounting.
The Unaudited Pro Forma Combined Condensed Financial Statements
have been prepared on the basis of assumptions described herein.

 
What these pro forma statements show

   The unaudited pro forma combined condensed financial statements give effect
to the merger using the purchase method of accounting.
The unaudited pro forma
combined condensed statement of operations for the year ended October 31, 2000
and the three months ended January 31, 2001 assume the merger took place on
November 1, 1999.
The unaudited pro forma combined condensed balance sheet
assumes the merger took place on January 31, 2001.

   
The Novell unaudited pro forma combined condensed statement of operations
for the year ended October 31, 2000 combine Novell's historical results of
operations for the year ended October 31, 2000 with Cambridge's historical
results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2000.
The Novell
unaudited pro forma combined condensed statement of operations for the three
months ended January 31, 2001 combine Novell's historical results of operations
for the three months ended January 31, 2001 with Cambridge's historical results
of operations for the three months ended December 31, 2000.
The Novell
unaudited pro forma combined condensed balance sheet combines Novell's
historical balance sheet as of January 31, 2001 with Cambridge's historical
balance sheet as of December 31, 2000.

 
Basis of Presentation

   The Novell unaudited pro forma combined condensed financial statements
reflect the Cambridge merger accounted for using the purchase method of
accounting and have been prepared on the basis of assumptions described in the
notes, including assumptions relating to the allocation of the amount of
consideration paid to the assets and liabilities of Cambridge based upon
preliminary estimates of their fair value.
The actual allocation of the amount
of consideration paid may differ from those assumptions after valuations and
other procedures are performed after the closing is completed.

 
Merger Charges

   Novell expects to incur a liability for the estimated costs incurred as a
result of the merger, such as costs resulting from vacating duplicate Cambridge
facilities and reducing headcount.
This liability is included as part of the
allocation of the purchase price.
The unaudited pro forma combined condensed
balance sheet includes the effect of these charges.
The unaudited pro forma
combined condensed statements of operations do not reflect these charges
because they are non-recurring.
These charges will be reflected in Novell's
consolidated financial statements in the period in which the merger is
consummated.

 
These pro forma unaudited combined condensed financial statements should be
 read with each company's financial statements

   The Novell unaudited pro forma combined condensed financial data should be
read in conjunction with the related notes included in this proxy statement-
prospectus and the consolidated audited and consolidated condensed unaudited
financial statements of Novell and the consolidated audited financial
statements of Cambridge, which are incorporated by reference in this proxy
statement-prospectus.
The Novell unaudited pro forma combined condensed
financial data are not necessarily indicative of what the actual results of
operations and financial position would have been had the Cambridge merger
taken place on November 1, 1999 or January 31, 2001, and do not indicate future
results of operations or financial position.

  NOTES TO NOVELL UNAUDITED PRO FORMA COMBINED CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

1.
Basis of Presentation

   The unaudited pro forma combined condensed financial statements give effect
to Novell's acquisition of Cambridge through a merger and exchange of shares.

The merger is being accounted for using the purchase method of accounting.
The
unaudited pro forma combined condensed financial statements have been prepared
on the basis of assumptions described in the following notes and include
assumptions relating to the allocation of the consideration paid for the assets
and liabilities of Cambridge based on estimated fair value.
The final
allocation of the purchase price may differ from the preliminary allocations.

In the opinion of management, all adjustments necessary for a fair presentation
of such unaudited pro forma combined financial statements have been made based
on the proposed terms and structure of the Cambridge merger.

   
The unaudited pro forma combined condensed consolidated balance sheet as of
January 31, 2001 reflects the financial position of Novell after giving effect
to the merger with Cambridge as if this merger occurred on January 31, 2001.

The unaudited pro forma combined condensed consolidated statement of operations
for the three month period ended January 31, 2001 includes the results for
Novell for the three month period ended January 31, 2001 and the results for
Cambridge for the three month period ended December 31, 2000.
The unaudited pro
forma combined condensed consolidated statement of operations for the year
ended October 31, 2000 includes the results for Novell for the year ended
October 31, 2000 and the results for Cambridge for the year ended December 31,
2000.
Both of these statements assume the acquisition of Cambridge occurred on
at the beginning of the periods presented.

   
As a result of Cambridge's acquisition of OSIX Pty. Ltd. in November 2000,
Novell may need to issue additional common stock with a fair value of up to 2
million Australian dollars at future dates if certain revenue and earnings
targets are met.
Given the contingent nature of this consideration, such amount
is not included in the pro forma financial statements.

   
Novell previously recognized revenue related to product sales to
distribution channel partners upon shipment to the partner and provided a
reserve for contractual return obligations and other estimated product returns.

Effective November 1, 2000, Novell changed its method of accounting for revenue
related to these product sales to recognize such revenues upon sell-through of
the respective product from the distribution channel partner to the end user.

Novell believes the change in accounting principle is preferable based on
guidance provided in SEC Staff Accounting Bulleting No. 101, Revenue
Recognition in Financial Statements.
The pro forma financial statements include
an adjustment to present the accounting change as if its was made retroactively
to prior periods.

   
The pro forma adjustments are preliminary and based on management's
estimates.
Based on the timing of the closing of the transaction, the
finalization of the integration plans and other factors, final adjustments may
differ materially from those presented in these pro forma financial statements.

These unaudited pro forma combined condensed consolidated financial statements
should be read in conjunction with the historical annual and interim financial
statements of Novell and annual financial statements of Cambridge that have
been filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, as incorporated by
reference within this document.


2.
Purchase Price Allocation

   Under the merger agreement each share of Cambridge common stock issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the effective date will be cancelled and
converted into the right to receive 0.668 shares of Novell common stock.
As of
the date of acquisition, all outstanding stock options will terminate and
Novell will not assume the Cambridge stock option plans.
As of March 28, 2001,
there were 63,532,271 shares of Cambridge common stock outstanding.
Based on
the 0.668 conversion ratio, these shares will be converted to 42,439,557 shares
of Novell common stock.
In order to calculate the value of the Novell stock
issued, we

  NOTES TO NOVELL UNAUDITED PRO FORMA COMBINED CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

utilized a stock price of $5.907 per share, which was based on an average
closing price of Novell common stock for a period of three days before and
three days after March 12, 2001, the date the merger was announced.
Based upon
this price and number of shares issued, stock consideration was estimated to
equal $250.7 million.
