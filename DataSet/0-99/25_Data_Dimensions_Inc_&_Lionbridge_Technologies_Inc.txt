regulator has approved or disapproved the Lionbridge common stock to be issued

          The date of this proxy statement/prospectus is       , 2001.

Dear Data Dimensions Stockholder:

   After careful consideration, the boards of directors of Data Dimensions,
Inc. and Lionbridge Technologies, Inc., have approved the merger of Data
Dimensions with Lionbridge.

   This combination will allow Data Dimensions to significantly further its
ambition to become the leader in the quality assurance and testing market,
focused on serving the global needs of its collective clients. It's a natural
combination of two fast-growing market leaders and fuels the creation of the
world leader in global technology testing and interoperability services.

   I am pleased to provide to you the enclosed proxy statement/prospectus
relating to a special meeting of the stockholders of Data Dimensions to be held
on June  , 2001, at 9:00 a.m. Pacific Daylight Savings Time, at Data
Dimensions' executive offices at 3535 Factoria Boulevard SE, Sterling Plaza,
3rd Floor, Bellevue, Washington.

   At the special meeting, you will be asked to vote, in person or by proxy, on
the proposed merger of Data Dimensions with Lionbridge. The merger will be
effected pursuant to the agreement and plan of reorganization, dated as of
March 8, 2001, as amended, by and among Lionbridge, Diamond Acquisition Corp.,
a wholly owned subsidiary of Lionbridge, and Data Dimensions. Pursuant to the
agreement and plan of reorganization, each outstanding share of common stock of
Data Dimensions will be converted into the right to receive 0.190884 of a share
of Lionbridge common stock. Lionbridge common stock is listed on the Nasdaq
National Market under the symbol "LIOX." If the merger is approved and
consummated, Data Dimensions will become a wholly owned subsidiary of
Lionbridge. The merger is described more fully in the proxy
statement/prospectus.

   Data Dimensions' board of directors has carefully reviewed and considered
the terms and conditions of the merger and the agreement and plan of
reorganization and has concluded that the terms are fair to, and in the best
interests of, Data Dimensions and its stockholders. One of the factors
considered in reaching this determination was the receipt by Data Dimensions'
board of directors of the opinion of its financial advisors, Updata Capital,
Inc., that the merger consideration was fair, from a financial point of view,
to Data Dimensions' stockholders on the day Lionbridge and Data Dimensions
signed the agreement and plan of reorganization. The stockholders of Data
Dimensions are urged to read such opinion, attached as Annex D to the proxy
statement/prospectus, in its entirety. Data Dimensions' board of directors
recommends that you vote FOR approval and adoption of the merger and the
agreement and plan of reorganization.

   The agreement and plan of reorganization must be approved by the holders of
a majority of the outstanding shares of common stock of Data Dimensions
entitled to vote at the special meeting. You should note that stockholders of
Data Dimensions entitled to vote at the special meeting who collectively
beneficially own approximately 18.9% of Data Dimensions' outstanding common
stock have already agreed to vote their shares in favor of the merger and the
agreement and plan of reorganization. You are encouraged to review the enclosed
proxy statement/prospectus and in particular review the matters referred to
under "Risk Factors" starting on page 9. Whether or not you plan to attend the
special meeting, please take the time to vote by promptly completing and
mailing the enclosed proxy card in the postage-paid envelope provided. Your
vote is very important.

                                      On Behalf of the Board of Directors,

                                      /s/ Peter A. Allen
                                      Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and
                                       President

   Neither the Securities and Exchange Commission nor any state securities
commission has approved or disapproved of this transaction and the securities
being offered by Lionbridge or determined if the proxy statement/prospectus is
accurate or adequate. Any representation to the contrary is a criminal offense.

   The proxy statement/prospectus is dated       , 2001 and was first mailed to
Data Dimensions' stockholders on or about       , 2001.

                             DATA DIMENSIONS, INC.
                           3535 Factoria Boulevard SE
                           Sterling Plaza, 3rd Floor
                           Bellevue, Washington 98006

                   NOTICE OF SPECIAL MEETING OF STOCKHOLDERS

                          TO BE HELD ON JUNE   , 2001

To the stockholders of Data Dimensions, Inc.:

   A special meeting of the stockholders of Data Dimensions, Inc., a Delaware
corporation, will be held at Data Dimensions' executive offices at 3535
Factoria Boulevard SE, Sterling Plaza, 3rd Floor, Bellevue, Washington on     ,
June  , 2001 at 9:00 a.m. Pacific Daylight Savings Time for the following
purposes:

     1.  To approve and adopt the merger and the agreement and plan of
  reorganization, dated as of March 8, 2001, as amended, by and among
  Lionbridge Technologies, Inc., Diamond Acquisition Corp., a wholly owned
  subsidiary of Lionbridge, and Data Dimensions, pursuant to which Diamond
  Acquisition Corp. will be merged with and into Data Dimensions, with Data
  Dimensions being the surviving corporation and becoming a wholly owned
  subsidiary of Lionbridge. A copy of the agreement and plan of
  reorganization, as amended, is attached as Annex A to the proxy
  statement/prospectus accompanying this notice; and

     2. To consider and act upon any other matter which may properly come
  before the special meeting and any adjournment or postponement of the Data
  Dimensions special meeting, including without limitation, potential
  adjournments or postponements of the Data Dimensions special meeting for
  the purpose of soliciting additional proxies in order to approve the
  proposed merger and agreement and plan of reorganization.

   This proxy statement/prospectus and the proxy card are being furnished to
the stockholders of Data Dimensions in connection with the solicitation of
proxies by Data Dimensions' board of directors for use at the special meeting
of stockholders.

   Data Dimensions' board of directors has approved the merger and the
agreement and plan of reorganization and recommends that you vote FOR approval
and adoption of the merger and agreement and plan of reorganization. The
proposal is described in more detail in the accompanying proxy
statement/prospectus, which you should read in its entirety before voting.

   The board of directors has fixed the close of business on        , 2001 as
the record date for determining the stockholders entitled to receive this
notice, and to vote their shares at the meeting or any adjournment or
postponement of the meeting. Only holders of record of common stock of Data
Dimensions at the close of business on the record date will be entitled to
notice of, and to vote at, the meeting and any adjournment or postponement of
the meeting. As of that date, there were [13,560,972] shares of common stock
outstanding. Each share of common stock is entitled to one vote on each matter
brought properly before the meeting. The representation in person, or by
properly executed proxy, of the holders of a majority of all shares of common
stock entitled to vote at the special meeting is necessary to constitute a
quorum at the special meeting of Data Dimensions.

   Under Delaware law and the charter documents of Data Dimensions, approval
and adoption of the merger and the agreement and plan of reorganization
requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the votes entitled to be cast by
holders of outstanding shares of Data Dimensions common stock on the Data
Dimensions record date.

   The board of directors has designated the two persons named on the enclosed
proxy card, Peter A. Allen and Laurence C. Leslie, to serve as proxies in
connection with the special meeting. All properly executed proxy

cards will be voted (except to the extent that authority to vote has been
withheld) and where a choice has been specified by the stockholder as provided
in the proxy card, it will be voted in accordance with the specifications on
the proxy card. If you sign and send in your proxy card and do not indicate how
you want to vote, it will be voted in favor of approval of the merger and the
agreement and plan of reorganization. You may revoke a proxy prior to its
execution by giving written notice to the Secretary of Data Dimensions, by
submission of another proxy bearing a later date, or by voting in person at the
special meeting. Such notice or later dated proxy will not affect a vote on any
matter taken prior to the receipt of the proxy revocation by Data Dimensions.

   If a quorum is present at the special meeting, the affirmative vote of the
holders of a majority of the shares of Data Dimensions common stock outstanding
is required for the approval and adoption of the merger and the agreement and
plan of reorganization. Abstentions from voting identified as such on the proxy
card and "broker non-votes" (as described below) are treated as present or
represented for purposes of determining the presence or absence of a quorum at
the special meeting. Brokers and other "street name" nominees holding shares
for the account of the beneficial owner of shares generally may vote the shares
in their own discretion. However, brokers and nominees generally do not have
authority to vote for "non-routine" proposals without receiving voting
instructions with respect to such proposals from the beneficial owners of the
shares. The proposal to approve the merger and the agreement and plan of
reorganization is a "non-routine" proposal and consequently requires voting
instructions from the beneficial owner so that the shares may be voted by the
beneficial owner's broker or nominee. A "broker non-vote" will occur if a
broker or nominee does not receive instructions from the beneficial owner with
respect to the proposal to approve the merger and the agreement and plan of
reorganization. Accordingly, abstentions and broker non-votes will have the
same effect as votes against the merger and the agreement and plan of
reorganization.

   The proxy statement/prospectus materials are being mailed on or about
      , 2001 to holders of record of Data Dimensions' common stock as of
      , 2001. The principal executive office and mailing address of Data
Dimensions is 3535 Factoria Boulevard SE, Sterling Plaza, 3rd Floor, Bellevue,
Washington 98006.

   All stockholders are cordially invited to attend the special meeting.
WHETHER OR NOT YOU PLAN TO ATTEND THE MEETING, PLEASE SIGN, DATE AND PROMPTLY
RETURN THE ENCLOSED PROXY CARD, WHICH YOU MAY REVOKE AT ANY TIME PRIOR TO ITS
USE. PROMPTLY SIGNING AND RETURNING YOUR PROXY CARD WILL HELP ENSURE THE
PRESENCE OF A QUORUM FOR THE MEETING AND WILL HELP AVOID ADDITIONAL PROXY
SOLICITATION EXPENSE. A postage-paid, self-addressed envelope is enclosed for
your convenience. Your shares will be voted at the meeting in accordance with
your proxy.

                      By Order of the Board of Directors,

                               /s/ Peter A. Allen

                     QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS ABOUT THE MERGER

Q: Why Are Lionbridge And Data Dimensions Proposing To Merge?

A:This is an opportunity for Data Dimensions to join with Lionbridge to be a
leading provider of testing and globalization services, and for Data Dimensions
stockholders to become Lionbridge stockholders. Lionbridge and Data Dimensions
anticipate that the merger will create significant growth and business
expansion opportunities for the combined company which are greater than those
that would be available to Data Dimensions as an independent company.

Q: What Will I Receive In The Merger?

A:If the merger is completed, you will receive 0.190884 of a share of
Lionbridge common stock for each share of Data Dimensions common stock you own.
Lionbridge will not issue fractional shares of Lionbridge common stock in the
merger. Instead of a fractional share, you will receive cash based on a price
per share of Lionbridge common stock of $5.6688, which represents the average
closing bid price of Lionbridge common stock over the five trading days ended
on the last trading day prior to the date of the agreement and plan of
reorganization.

Q: After This Combination, Will I Have The Same Ownership And Voting
   Percentages In Lionbridge As I Now Have In Data Dimensions?

A:No. You will have a lower ownership and voting interest in Lionbridge than
you currently have in Data Dimensions. Upon completion of the combination, Data
Dimensions stockholders are expected to own and have voting power of
approximately 8.5% of Lionbridge.

Q: Will I Be Able To Trade The Lionbridge Common Stock That I Receive In The
   Merger?

A:The Lionbridge common stock you receive will be freely tradeable unless you
are an affiliate of Lionbridge or Data Dimensions. Lionbridge common stock is
listed on the Nasdaq National Market under the symbol "LIOX."

Q: What Will My Tax Consequences Be As A Result Of This Share Exchange?

A:Lionbridge and Data Dimensions expect that, for U.S. federal income tax
purposes, the exchange of your shares of Data Dimensions common stock for
shares of Lionbridge common stock generally will not cause you to recognize any
gain or loss. You will, however, have to recognize income or gain in connection
with any cash received instead of fractional shares.

Q: What Do I Need To Do Now?

A:After carefully reading and considering the information contained in this
proxy statement/prospectus, please complete, date and sign your proxy and
return it in the enclosed return envelope as soon as possible, so that your
shares may be represented at the special meeting of the stockholders of Data
Dimensions. If you sign and send in your proxy and do not indicate how you want
to vote, Data Dimensions will count your proxy as a vote in favor of approval
of the merger and the agreement and plan of reorganization. If you abstain from
voting or do not vote, it will have the same effect as a vote against approval
of the merger and the agreement and plan of reorganization. The special meeting
will take place on June  , 2001. You may attend the special meeting and vote
your shares in person. Even if you plan to attend the special meeting, the Data
Dimensions board of directors recommends that you complete, sign and date the
enclosed proxy and return it promptly in the enclosed postage-paid envelope.

Q: What Does The Data Dimensions Board Of Directors Recommend?

A:The Data Dimensions board of directors has approved the merger and the
agreement and plan of reorganization and has recommended that you vote FOR the
proposal to approve and adopt the merger and the agreement and plan of
reorganization.

Q: Can I Change My Vote After I Have Mailed My Signed Proxy?

A:Yes. You can change your vote at any time before your proxy is voted at the
special meeting. You can do this in one of three ways. First, you can send a
written notice stating that you would like to revoke your proxy. Second, you
can complete and submit a new proxy. If you choose either of these two methods,
you must submit your notice of revocation or your new proxy to the Secretary of
Data Dimensions at the address for Data Dimensions set forth below. Third, you
can attend the special meeting and vote in person. Attendance at the special
meeting without voting in person will not revoke your proxy. If you hold your
shares through a broker or bank, you should follow the instructions provided by
that firm to revoke your proxy.

Q: If My Data Dimensions Shares Are Held In "Street Name" By My Broker, Will My
   Broker Vote My Shares For Me?

A:Your broker will not be able to vote your Data Dimensions shares on your
behalf unless you provide instructions on how to vote. You should follow the
directions provided by your broker regarding how to instruct your broker to
vote your shares. Without instructions, your shares will be treated as present
or represented for purposes of determining the presence or absence of a quorum
at the special meeting, but will not be voted at the special meeting, and will
have the same effect as a vote against the approval of the merger and the
agreement and plan of reorganization.

Q: Should I Send In My Stock Certificates Now?

A:No. After the merger is completed, you will receive written instructions for
exchanging your stock certificates. Please do not send in your stock
certificates with your proxy.

Q: What Will Be The Accounting Treatment Of This Share Exchange?

A:The purchase method of accounting will apply to the combination.

Q: When Do You Expect To Complete The Merger?

A:Lionbridge and Data Dimensions are working to complete the merger in June
2001. Because the merger is subject to conditions contained in the agreement
and plan of reorganization, however, Lionbridge and Data Dimensions cannot
predict the exact timing.

this proxy statement/ prospectus or the enclosed proxy, you should contact:

                                   The Merger
                                   (page 43)

   The agreement and plan of reorganization and amendment no. 1 to the
agreement and plan of reorganization are attached as Annex A to this proxy
statement/prospectus and are incorporated by reference in this proxy
statement/prospectus. Lionbridge and Data Dimensions encourage you to read the
agreement and plan of reorganization, as amended, as it is the legal document
that governs the merger.

   Through the merger, Data Dimensions will become a wholly owned subsidiary of
Lionbridge. Data Dimensions stockholders will receive Lionbridge common stock
in exchange for their shares of Data Dimensions common stock. Each issued and
outstanding share of Data Dimensions common stock other than shares held by
Data Dimensions, Lionbridge or Diamond Acquisition Corp. will be converted into
the right to receive 0.190884 of a share of Lionbridge common stock.

                      Lionbridge's Reasons for the Merger
                                   (page 32)

   Lionbridge believes it will derive a number of potential benefits from the
merger, including the following:

  .  The merger will enhance the opportunity for Lionbridge to realize its
     strategic objectives of expanding its market share and increasing its
     ability to compete effectively as a provider of comprehensive outsourced
     testing services to the global technology industry.

  .  Through the merger, Lionbridge will acquire or enhance its ability to
     provide software testing, quality assurance consulting services, on-site
     training for test planning, and application development and maintenance
     services, and thus provide a broader range and expanded scope of testing
     and service offerings to its customers.

  .  The combination of Lionbridge's globalization services with Data
     Dimensions' testing, consulting, and applications maintenance services
     will enable Lionbridge to provide an integrated and comprehensive
     testing, certification, and globalization solution for its customers.

  .  Acquiring Data Dimensions will allow Lionbridge to increase its testing
     labs from five to a total of 10, with six labs in the United States and
     four labs outside of the United States, and thereby increase its ability
     to rapidly and efficiently meet the needs of its global customers.

  .  The combined businesses will bring additional geographic coverage,
     management depth, and technical and project management resources to
     Lionbridge to address larger and more varied client projects, and
     economies of scale.

  .  The combined businesses will enhance Lionbridge's technical testing
     staff with personnel with additional testing expertise and experience.

                    Data Dimensions' Reasons for the Merger
                                   (page 33)

   The board of directors of Data Dimensions believes that the terms of the
merger and the agreement and plan of reorganization are fair to, and in the
best interests of, the stockholders of Data Dimensions. In reaching its
decision, the board of directors considered numerous factors, including the
following:

  .  The merger affords the new combined company the opportunity to create
     one of the largest application testing services businesses and enables
     it to offer its customers a broader array of products and services from
     more locations.

  .  The merger has the potential to create a company with greater critical
     mass that is better positioned to compete for business opportunities and
     participate in industry growth.

  .  The merger will provide increased liquidity for Data Dimensions
     stockholders through continued listing of Lionbridge common stock on the
     Nasdaq National Market.

  .  The merger will provide Data Dimensions' stockholders with the
     opportunity to share in the combined company's long-term growth as a
     result of the merger.

          Recommendation of the Board of Directors of Data Dimensions
                                   (page 33)

   The board of directors of Data Dimensions voted to approve the merger and
agreement and plan of reorganization and the transactions contemplated
thereby. The Data Dimensions board of directors believes that the merger is
fair to, and in the best interests of, Data Dimensions and its stockholders
and recommends that you vote FOR the proposal to approve and adopt the merger
and agreement and plan of reorganization.

                 What Data Dimensions Stockholders Will Receive
                                   (page 43)

   As a result of the merger, stockholders of Data Dimensions will receive
0.190884 of a share of Lionbridge common stock for each share of Data
Dimensions common stock that they own at the effective time of the merger. Data
Dimensions' stock option plan provides that each issued and outstanding but
unvested option to purchase shares of Data Dimensions common stock under the
stock option plan shall accelerate upon the giving of notice by Data Dimensions
to optionees of a change of control event (such as the merger), which notice
shall be given not less than 30 days before the effective time of the merger.
Each unexpired and unexercised outstanding option or warrant to purchase shares
of Data Dimensions common stock previously issued by Data Dimensions will be
assumed by Lionbridge at the effective time of the merger and will be
exercisable to purchase shares of Lionbridge common stock, upon substantially
the same terms and conditions. The number of shares of Lionbridge common stock
subject to the assumed Data Dimensions stock options and warrants will be
adjusted by multiplying the number of shares of Data Dimensions stock subject
to the option or warrant by 0.190884 and the exercise price per share of
Lionbridge common stock under the Data Dimensions stock options and warrants
will equal the exercise price per share of the Data Dimensions common stock
under the original stock option or warrant divided by 0.190884.

   Instead of fractional shares, any holder of Data Dimensions stock who would
otherwise be entitled to a fraction of a share of Lionbridge common stock will
be paid the cash value of the fraction, which will be equal to the fraction
multiplied by $5.6688 (the average closing bid price of Lionbridge common stock
as calculated in accordance with the terms of the agreement and plan of
reorganization).

   Based on the 13,560,972 shares of Data Dimensions common stock issued and
outstanding as of March 8, 2001, approximately 2,588,570 shares of Lionbridge
common stock will be issued to the holders of Data Dimensions common stock in
the merger, or approximately 8.5% of the issued and outstanding shares of
Lionbridge common stock following the merger. The actual number of shares of
Lionbridge common stock issued may differ because the number of shares of Data
Dimensions common stock outstanding at the closing may differ. Lionbridge had
28,038,697 shares of common stock outstanding as of March 31, 2001.

 Interests of Executive Officers and Directors of Data Dimensions in the Merger
                                   (page 40)

   In considering the recommendation of the Data Dimensions board of directors,
you should be aware of the interests that the executive officers and directors
of Data Dimensions have in the merger. These interests include:

  .  acceleration of the vesting of options;

  .  cash severance payments, continuation of health benefits and cash
     payments for any accrued and unused vacation;

  .  indemnification of officers and directors; and

  .  becoming executives of Lionbridge.

   As of March 31, 2001, executive officers and directors of Data Dimensions
held 55,992 shares of Data Dimensions common stock and options to purchase
1,261,007 shares of Data Dimensions common stock, all of which will become
exercisable upon the giving of notice by Data Dimensions to optionees of the
merger.

                      What Will Happen to Data Dimensions
                                   (page 43)

   If the merger is completed, Data Dimensions will merge with a wholly owned
subsidiary of Lionbridge and will become a wholly owned subsidiary of
Lionbridge. Individuals who owned stock in Data Dimensions before the merger
will own stock in Lionbridge after the merger.

                     Conditions to Completion of the Merger
                                   (page 48)

   The completion of the merger depends upon meeting a number of conditions,
including the following:

  .  the approval and adoption of the merger and the agreement and plan of
     reorganization by the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of
     the outstanding shares of Data Dimensions common stock entitled to vote;

  .  holders of not more than 4% of the outstanding capital stock of Data
     Dimensions shall have exercised appraisal rights with respect to the
     merger;

  .  the shares of Lionbridge common stock issuable to the stockholders of
     Data Dimensions shall have been approved for quotation on the Nasdaq
     National Market;

  .  the termination, waiver or satisfaction of any registration rights,
     rights of first refusal, voting rights, liquidation preference or
     redemption rights relating to any security of Data Dimensions; and

  .  other customary contractual conditions specified in the agreement and
     plan of reorganization.

   Certain of the conditions to the merger may be waived by the company
entitled to assert the condition.

                       No Solicitation by Data Dimensions
                                   (page 48)

   Data Dimensions has agreed that it will not solicit, encourage, initiate or
participate in any discussion regarding a business combination of Data
Dimensions with any other party. Data Dimensions has further agreed to use its
reasonable best efforts to ensure that none of its officers, directors,
stockholders, agents, representatives and affiliates do any of these things.

            Termination of the Agreement and Plan of Reorganization
                                   (page 49)

   The agreement and plan of reorganization may be terminated in the following
ways at any time prior to the effective time of the merger:

  .  Lionbridge, Data Dimensions and Diamond Acquisition Corp. may terminate
     the agreement and plan of reorganization by mutual written consent;

  .  Lionbridge may terminate the agreement and plan of reorganization if it
     is not in material breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or
     agreement contained in the agreement and plan of reorganization and Data
     Dimensions is in material breach of any representation, warranty,
     covenant or agreement contained in the agreement and plan of
     reorganization;

  .  Data Dimensions may terminate the agreement and plan of reorganization
     if (i) it is not in material breach of any representation, warranty,
     covenant or agreement contained in the agreement and plan of
     reorganization and Lionbridge is in material breach of any
     representation, warranty, covenant or agreement contained in the
     agreement and plan of reorganization or (ii) the stockholders of Data
     Dimensions fail to approve and adopt the merger and the agreement and
     plan of reorganization by July 31, 2001; or

  .  Either Lionbridge or Data Dimensions may terminate the agreement and
     plan of reorganization by giving written notice to the other party if
     the effective time of the merger has not occurred on or before July 31,
     2001, except that the right to terminate the agreement and plan of
     reorganization is not available to a party who has not fulfilled an
     obligation under the agreement and plan of reorganization which resulted
     in the merger not occurring on or before July 31, 2001.

                                Termination Fees
                                   (page 49)

   The agreement and plan of reorganization requires Data Dimensions to pay to
Lionbridge a termination fee of $600,000 if the Data Dimensions board of
directors does not recommended to its stockholders to vote in favor of approval
of the merger and either Lionbridge or Data Dimensions terminates the agreement
and plan of reorganization pursuant to certain termination provisions of the
agreement and plan of reorganization. In addition, Data Dimensions must also
pay a $600,000 termination fee to Lionbridge if either Lionbridge or Data
Dimensions terminates the agreement and plan of reorganization pursuant to
certain termination provisions of the agreement and plan of reorganization and
Data Dimensions completes an acquisition with a party other than Lionbridge at
any time on or prior to the nine-month anniversary of the termination of the
agreement and plan of reorganization. Finally, if either Lionbridge or Data
Dimensions terminates the agreement and plan of reorganization as a result of a
material breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement of the
other party, the breaching party must pay a $600,000 termination fee to the
terminating party.

       The Data Dimensions Special Meeting of Stockholders; Vote Required
                                   (page 26)

   Data Dimensions will hold a special meeting of its stockholders to:

  .  approve and adopt the merger and the agreement and plan of
     reorganization; and

  .  transact such other business as may properly come before the Data
     Dimensions special meeting.

   The approval and adoption of the merger and the agreement and plan of
reorganization will require the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority
of the outstanding shares of Data Dimensions common stock entitled to vote at
the Data Dimensions special meeting.

   As of March 8, 2001, the directors, executive officers and 10% stockholders
of Data Dimensions and their affiliates who collectively beneficially own
approximately 18.9% of the outstanding voting power of Data Dimensions have
already agreed under voting agreements to vote in favor of the approval and
adoption of the merger and the agreement and plan of reorganization.

                               Voting Agreements
                                   (page 51)

   As a condition to entering into the agreement and plan of reorganization,
all of the directors, executive officers, affiliates and 10% stockholders of
Data Dimensions entered into voting agreements under which they agreed to vote
all of their shares of Data Dimensions common stock to approve the merger and
the agreement and plan of reorganization. The Data Dimensions stockholders who
entered into voting agreements collectively beneficially own approximately
18.9% of the outstanding Data Dimensions capital stock as of March 8, 2001. The
form of voting agreement is attached as Annex B to this proxy
statement/prospectus. Lionbridge and Data Dimensions encourage you to read the
form of voting agreement in its entirety.

                             Stock Option Agreement
                                   (page 51)

   On March 8, 2001, Data Dimensions entered into a stock option agreement with
Lionbridge which grants Lionbridge the option to purchase a number of shares of
Data Dimensions common stock equal to 19.9% of the shares of Data Dimensions
common stock issued and outstanding as of the date the option becomes
exercisable, or approximately 16.6% after issuance of the shares of Data
Dimensions common stock subject to the option. The option is not currently
exercisable and Lionbridge may exercise the option only upon the consummation
of an acquisition of Data Dimensions by a party other than Lionbridge during
the nine-month period following any termination of the agreement and plan of
reorganization. The exercise price of the option is $1.08 per share. The option
may discourage third parties who are interested in acquiring a significant
ownership interest in Data Dimensions and is intended to increase the
likelihood that the merger will be completed. The stock option agreement is
attached as Annex C to this proxy statement/prospectus. Lionbridge and Data
Dimensions encourage you to read the stock option agreement in its entirety.

                      Governmental and Regulatory Matters
                                   (page 104)

   Lionbridge and Data Dimensions do not believe that any material federal or
state governmental approvals will be required for completion of the merger,
other than compliance with federal and state securities laws applicable for the
issuance of Lionbridge common stock in the merger and the soliciting of the
votes of the Data Dimensions stockholders to approve the merger and the
agreement and plan of reorganization and compliance with the Delaware General
Corporation Law.

                 Opinion of Data Dimensions' Financial Advisor
                                   (page 35)

   In deciding to approve the merger, Data Dimensions' board of directors
received an opinion from its financial advisor, Updata Capital, as to the
fairness of the purchase price from a financial perspective as of March 8,
2001. The complete text of the opinion is attached as Annex D to this proxy
statement/prospectus and should be read carefully in its entirety. THE OPINION
OF UPDATA CAPITAL IS DIRECTED TO THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS OF DATA DIMENSIONS AND
DOES NOT CONSTITUTE A RECOMMENDATION TO ANY STOCKHOLDER WITH RESPECT TO THE
MERGER.

            Important United States Federal Income Tax Consequences
                                   (page 38)

   Lionbridge and Data Dimensions have structured the merger so that no gain or
loss generally will be recognized by Data Dimensions stockholders for federal
income tax purposes on their exchange of shares of Data Dimensions common stock
for shares of Lionbridge common stock.

   Tax matters are very complicated, and the tax consequences of the merger to
you will depend on the facts of your own situation. You should consult your tax
advisor for a full understanding of the tax consequences of the merger to you.

                       Accounting Treatment of the Merger
                                   (page 40)

   The merger will be treated as a purchase for accounting and financial
reporting purposes, which means that Data Dimensions will be treated as a
separate entity for periods prior to the closing, and thereafter as a wholly
owned subsidiary of Lionbridge. In addition, Lionbridge estimates that it will
record on its balance sheet a deferred credit of approximately $2.2 million,
which will be amortized over a five-year period following the merger.

           Cautionary Statement Concerning Forward-Looking Statements
                                   (page 42)

   Data Dimensions and Lionbridge have made forward-looking statements in this
document that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Forward-looking
statements include information concerning the possible or assumed future
benefits of the merger and results of operations of the combined company as
well as statements preceded by, followed by, or that include the words
"believes," "expects," "anticipates," "intends," "future," "could," "may" and
similar words or expressions (as well as other words or expressions referencing
future events, conditions or circumstances). You should understand that certain
important factors, in addition to those discussed elsewhere in this document,
could affect the future results of the combined company and could cause these
results to differ materially from those expressed in Data Dimensions' and
Lionbridge's forward-looking statements. Many of the factors that will
determine these results are beyond Data Dimensions' and Lionbridge's ability to
control or predict. Stockholders are cautioned not to put undue reliance on any
forward-looking statement. For a discussion of some of the factors that may
cause actual results to differ materially from those suggested by the forward-
looking statements, please read carefully the information under "Risk Factors"

                                  RISK FACTORS

   You should carefully consider the following risk factors relating to the
merger before you decide whether to vote to approve and adopt the merger and
the agreement and plan of reorganization and the proposed issuance of
Lionbridge common stock in connection with the merger. You should also consider
the other information in this proxy statement/prospectus and the additional
information in Lionbridge's and Data Dimensions' other reports on file with the
SEC. For more information, see "Where You Can Find More Information" on page

Risks Relating to the Merger

   Lionbridge may face challenges in integrating Lionbridge and Data Dimensions
and, as a result, may not realize the expected benefits of the anticipated
merger.

   Integrating the operations, technologies, services and personnel of
Lionbridge and Data Dimensions will be a complex process, and Lionbridge cannot
be certain that the integration will be completed rapidly or will achieve the
anticipated benefits of the merger. The successful integration of Lionbridge
and Data Dimensions will require, among other things, integration of the
Lionbridge and Data Dimensions testing sales and marketing groups and the
Lionbridge and Data Dimensions consulting and testing service delivery
organizations. The diversion of the attention of the Lionbridge and Data
Dimensions management and any difficulties encountered in the process of
combining Lionbridge and Data Dimensions could cause the disruption of, or a
loss of momentum in, the activities of the combined company's business.
Further, the process of combining Lionbridge and Data Dimensions could
negatively affect employee morale and the ability of the combined company to
retain some of its key employees after the merger. The inability to
successfully integrate the operations and personnel of Lionbridge and Data
Dimensions, or any significant delay in achieving integration, could adversely
impact the business, financial condition and operating results of the combined
company after the merger.

   Lionbridge's stock price is volatile and the value of the Lionbridge common
stock issued in the merger will depend on its market price at the time of the
merger, and no adjustment will be made as a result of changes in the market
price of Lionbridge's common stock.

   Under the agreement and plan of reorganization, the conversion ratio used to
determine the number of shares of Lionbridge's common stock that Data
Dimensions stockholders will receive is unaffected by the share price of
Lionbridge's common stock. Increases in the value of Lionbridge's common stock
will result in a higher price being paid by Lionbridge for Data Dimensions and
more value received by Data Dimensions stockholders in the merger. Decreases in
the value of Lionbridge's common stock will result in a lower price being paid
by Lionbridge for Data Dimensions and less value received by Data Dimensions
stockholders in the merger. You will not know the value of Lionbridge's common
stock to be issued in the merger at the time of the Data Dimensions special
meeting of stockholders. Under the agreement and plan of reorganization,
neither Lionbridge nor Data Dimensions will have the right to terminate or
renegotiate the agreement and plan of reorganization or to resolicit proxies as
a result of any increase or decrease in the value of Lionbridge's common stock.
The market price of Lionbridge's common stock, like that for the shares of many
other high technology companies, has been and may continue to be volatile.
Recently, the stock market in general and the shares of technology companies in
particular have experienced significant price fluctuations. The market price
may continue to fluctuate significantly in response to various factors,
including:

  .  quarterly variations in operating results;

  .  the announcement of technological innovations;

  .  the introduction of new services by Lionbridge and its competitors;

  .  changes in estimates by securities analysts;

  .   market conditions in the industry;

  .   announcements and actions by competitors and customers;

  .   regulatory and judicial actions; and

  .   general economic conditions.

   Lionbridge will incur significant merger-related costs in the quarter in
which it consummates the merger and during the post-merger integration period.

   Lionbridge expects to incur costs of approximately $500,000 in connection
with the merger which relate to financial advisory, legal and accounting
services and other integration expenses. Actual costs incurred may be higher
than Lionbridge anticipates. In addition, Lionbridge may incur other additional
unanticipated merger costs. These costs may delay the anticipated benefits of
the merger.

   Customers of Lionbridge and Data Dimensions may delay or cancel orders as a
result of concerns over the merger.

   The announcement and closing of the merger could cause customers and
potential customers of Lionbridge and Data Dimensions to delay or cancel orders
for services as a result of customer concerns and uncertainty over integration
and support of the combined company's services. Such a delay or cancellation of
orders could materially reduce the combined company's revenue and cash flow,
and ability to achieve and maintain profitability.

   The merger may result in a loss of employees which could harm the combined
company's results of operations.

   Difficulties in integrating the operations of Lionbridge and Data
Dimensions, including the uncertainty related to organizational changes, could
also negatively affect employee morale and result in the loss of key employees.
Lionbridge may not be able to retain Data Dimensions' key management, sales and
marketing, and technical personnel. Any steps taken by Lionbridge to address
employee attrition may not be effective, and this attrition could negatively
affect the combined company's results of operations.

   Failure to complete the merger could harm each company's stock price and
future business and operations.

   Both Lionbridge and Data Dimensions face a number of special risks if the
merger is not completed, including the following:

  .  Lionbridge or Data Dimensions may be required to pay to the other party
     a termination fee of $600,000;

  .  the option Data Dimensions granted to Lionbridge to purchase 19.9% of
     Data Dimensions' outstanding common stock may become exercisable;

  .  the price of Lionbridge common stock and Data Dimensions common stock
     may decline to the extent the current market price of Lionbridge common
     stock and Data Dimensions common stock reflects the assumption that the
     merger will be completed; and

  .  costs related to the merger, such as legal, accounting and financial
     advisor fees, must be paid even if the merger is not completed.

   In addition, current and prospective Lionbridge and Data Dimensions
employees and customers may experience uncertainty and could terminate their
relationships with Lionbridge or Data Dimensions if the merger is not completed
and Lionbridge's and Data Dimensions' businesses may be harmed.

   Further, if the merger is terminated and Data Dimensions determines to seek
another business combination, it is not certain that Data Dimensions will be
able to find a party willing to combine with it on equivalent or more
attractive terms.

Risks Relating to Lionbridge

   Lionbridge's revenue could be negatively affected by the delay of its
clients' product releases or the loss of a major client.

   A significant portion of Lionbridge's revenue is linked to the product
release cycle of its clients. As a result, Lionbridge performs varying amounts
of work for specific clients from year to year based on their product
development schedules. A major client in one year may not have use for a
similar level of Lionbridge's services in another year. In addition, Lionbridge
derives a significant portion of its revenue from large projects and programs
for a limited number of clients. In 2000, Lionbridge's largest customer
accounted for approximately 9% of its revenue and Lionbridge's five largest
clients accounted for approximately 33% of its revenue. As a result, the loss
of any major client or a significant reduction in a large project's scope could
materially reduce Lionbridge's revenue and cash flow, and adversely affect its
ability to achieve and maintain profitability.

   Lionbridge has an accumulated deficit, is not currently profitable, and
anticipates future losses.

   Lionbridge has incurred substantial losses since it was founded, and it
anticipates it will continue to incur losses for the foreseeable future.
Lionbridge had an accumulated deficit of approximately $79.3 million as of
December 31, 2000 and a net loss of $20.3 million for the year ended December
31, 2000. Although Lionbridge's revenue has grown significantly since 1997,
this growth may not be sustainable or indicative of future results of
operations. Lionbridge intends to continue to invest in internal expansion,
infrastructure, integration of its acquired companies into its existing
operations, select acquisitions, and its sales and marketing efforts. In
addition, Lionbridge's acquisitions have significantly increased its intangible
assets, such as goodwill, and the charges it expects to incur in connection
with the amortization of these intangible assets will have a material adverse
impact on its ability to achieve and maintain profitability for the foreseeable
future. Lionbridge cannot predict if it will operate profitably.

   If Lionbridge's losses continue, it will need to raise additional capital.
If Lionbridge is unable to do so, or does so on unfavorable terms, the value of
your investment in its stock may decline.

   If Lionbridge's losses continue, it will be unable to pay its expenses
unless it raises additional capital. If Lionbridge needs to raise additional
capital but is unable to do so, it may not be able to continue as a going
concern. If Lionbridge needs to raise additional capital but is able to do so
only on unfavorable terms, the value of your investment in its stock may
decline.

   The uncertainty in the technology market could affect Lionbridge's ability
to achieve operating plans.

   A substantial portion of Lionbridge's revenue is derived from technology
companies, including Web-based businesses. Many technology companies have
experienced economic slow downs in 2000 and 2001 and may continue to experience
these slow downs throughout 2001 and beyond. A continued slow down in the
technology market will have a negative impact on Lionbridge's ability to
achieve its operating plans.

   Potential fluctuations in Lionbridge's quarterly results make financial
forecasting difficult and could affect its common stock trading price.

   As a result of fluctuations in Lionbridge's revenue tied to foreign currency
fluctuations, its clients' release cycles, the three- to nine-month length of
its typical sales cycle, rapid growth, acquisitions, the emerging nature of the
markets in which it competes, the recent slow down in the U.S. and world
economies, and other factors

outside its control, Lionbridge believes that quarter-to-quarter comparisons of
results of operations are not necessarily meaningful. You should not rely on
the results of any one quarter as an indication of its future performance.
Lionbridge may not experience revenue increases in future years comparable to
the revenue increases in prior years. If in some future quarter its results of
operations were to fall below the expectations of securities analysts and
investors, the trading price of its common stock would likely decline.

   Lionbridge generally does not have long-term service agreements, which makes
revenue forecasting difficult.

   A majority of Lionbridge's revenue is derived from individual projects
rather than long-term service agreements. Lionbridge cannot assure you that a
client will engage it for further services once a project is completed or that
a client will not unilaterally reduce the scope of, or terminate, existing
projects. You should not predict or anticipate Lionbridge's future revenue
based on the number of clients it has or the size of its existing projects. The
absence of long-term contracts makes it difficult to predict Lionbridge's
future revenue.

   Lionbridge may be liable for defects or errors in the services it provides
to its clients.

   Many of the services Lionbridge provides are critical to its clients'
businesses. Any defects or errors in these services could result in:

  .  delayed or lost client revenue;

  .  adverse reaction to its clients from their end users and, ultimately,
     toward Lionbridge;

  .  claims against Lionbridge;

  .  negative publicity; and

  .  additional expenditures to correct the defect or error.

   Liability claims could require Lionbridge to spend significant time and
money in litigation or to pay significant damages. Although Lionbridge
maintains general liability insurance, including coverage for errors and
omissions, Lionbridge cannot assure you that this coverage will be available in
amounts sufficient to cover one or more large claims, or that the insurer will
not disclaim coverage as to any future claims.

   If Lionbridge fails to attract and retain professional staff, its ability to
complete its projects and obtain new projects could suffer.

   Lionbridge's failure to attract and retain qualified employees could impair
its ability to complete existing projects and bid for or obtain new projects
and, as a result, could adversely affect its ability to grow its business and
revenue. Lionbridge's ability to grow and increase its market share largely
depends on its ability to hire, train, retain, and manage highly skilled
employees, including project managers and testing, technical, translation, and
sales and marketing personnel. There is a significant shortage of, and intense
competition for, personnel who are qualified to perform the services Lionbridge
provides. In addition, Lionbridge must make sure its employees maintain their
technical expertise and business skills. Lionbridge cannot assure you that it
will be able to attract a sufficient number of qualified employees or that it
will successfully train and manage the employees it hires.

   Lionbridge may be unable to continue to grow at its historical growth rates
or to manage its growth effectively.

   Continued, planned growth is a key component of increasing the value of
Lionbridge. In the past four years, Lionbridge's business has grown
significantly and it anticipates future internal growth and growth through
additional acquisitions. This rapid growth places a significant demand on
management and operational resources. In order to manage growth effectively,
Lionbridge must implement and improve its operational systems and controls.
This additional growth may further strain its management and operational
resources.

Lionbridge's growth could also be adversely affected by many other factors,
including economic downturns. As a result of these concerns, Lionbridge cannot
be sure that it will continue to grow, or, if it does grow, that it will be
able to maintain its historical growth rate.

   Lionbridge's multi-year outsourcing relationship strategy may cause it to be
unprofitable.

   Part of Lionbridge's strategy is to acquire other companies' internal
localization operations and then enter into multi-year contracts with the
sellers of these operations to meet their globalization requirements on an
outsourcing basis. As such, Lionbridge's strategy is to buy these operations
with the objective of recouping its up-front purchase price out of future
revenue and profits from the seller. If Lionbridge pays too much for these
acquisitions or these contracts prove unprofitable, its revenue and
profitability will suffer.

   Difficulties presented by international economic, political, legal,
accounting, and business factors could negatively affect Lionbridge's business
in international markets.

   A large component of Lionbridge's operations is its ability to conduct
business in international markets, as evidenced by the fact that a large part
of its operations are outside of the United States. As a result, Lionbridge's
business is subject to the political and economic fluctuations in various
countries. Lionbridge has experienced foreign currency fluctuations and they
may have a more significant impact on its revenue, cash flow and ability to
achieve and maintain profitability as it continues to grow its business. In
addition, Lionbridge has experienced long payment cycles and occasional
problems in collecting accounts receivable originating outside of the United
States. Lionbridge has experienced exchange rate losses as a result of
fluctuations in the Euro and other currencies and slowdowns in revenue growth
as its clients reassessed their strategies in various countries based on
political and economic conditions. In addition, as Lionbridge continues to
employ and retain personnel throughout the world and apply varying employment
laws, Lionbridge may face difficulties in integrating such personnel on a cost-
efficient basis. To date, Lionbridge has been able to successfully staff its
international operations, but if Lionbridge continues to grow its operations,
it may become more difficult to manage its business. If Lionbridge fails to
manage these operations successfully, its ability to service its clients and
grow its business will be seriously impeded.

   Lionbridge's intangible assets represent a significant portion of its
assets; amortization of its intangible assets will adversely impact its net
income, and Lionbridge may never realize the full value of its intangible
assets.

   Lionbridge's acquisitions have resulted in the creation of significant
goodwill and other intangible assets, which are generally being amortized over
five-year periods. At December 31, 2000, Lionbridge had goodwill and other
acquisition-related intangible assets of approximately $14.9 million, net of
accumulated amortization, which represented approximately 24.0% of its total
assets. Lionbridge will continue to incur non-cash charges in connection with
the amortization of its intangible assets over their respective useful lives,
and Lionbridge expects these charges will have a significant adverse impact on
Lionbridge's ability to achieve and maintain profitability for the foreseeable
future.

   Lionbridge cannot assure you that it will ever realize the value of these
intangible assets. In the future, as events or changes in circumstances
indicate that the carrying amount of its intangible assets may not be
recoverable, Lionbridge will evaluate the carrying value of its intangible
assets and may take an accelerated charge to its earnings. Any future
determination requiring the write-off of a significant portion of unamortized
intangible assets could have a material adverse effect on its ability to
achieve and maintain profitability.

   Pursuing and completing potential acquisitions could divert management
attention and financial resources and may not produce the desired business
results.

   In May 2000, Lionbridge acquired all of the capital stock of INT'L.com and
Harvard Translations, and in January 2001, acquired all of the capital stock of
Quality Group Labs. As part of its growth strategy,

Lionbridge intends to continue pursuing and making acquisitions of other
complementary businesses. Lionbridge does not have specific personnel dedicated
solely to pursuing and making acquisitions. As a result, if Lionbridge pursues
any acquisition, its management, in addition to their operational
responsibilities, could spend a significant amount of time and management and
financial resources to pursue and integrate the acquired business with its
existing business. To pay for an acquisition, Lionbridge might use capital
stock, cash or a combination of both. Alternatively, Lionbridge may borrow
money from a bank or other lender. If Lionbridge uses capital stock, its
stockholders will experience dilution. If Lionbridge uses cash or debt
financing, its financial liquidity will be reduced. In addition, from an
accounting perspective, an acquisition may involve nonrecurring charges or
involve amortization of significant amounts of goodwill that could adversely
affect its ability to achieve and maintain profitability.

   Despite the investment of these management and financial resources and
completion of due diligence with respect to these efforts, an acquisition may
not produce the revenue, earnings or business synergies that Lionbridge
anticipated, and an acquired service or technology may not perform as expected
for a variety of reasons, including:

  .  difficulties in the assimilation of the operations, technologies,
     products and personnel of the acquired company;

  .  risks of entering markets in which Lionbridge has no or limited prior
     experience;

  .  expenses of any undisclosed or potential legal liabilities of the
     acquired company;

  .  the applicability of rules and regulations that might restrict
     Lionbridge's ability to operate; and

  .  the potential loss of key employees of the acquired company.

   Lionbridge may have difficulty in identifying and competing for acquisition
opportunities.

   Lionbridge's business strategy includes the pursuit of strategic
acquisitions. Lionbridge has engaged from time to time in discussions with
third parties concerning potential acquisitions of niche expertise, businesses,
and operations. Except for its agreement to acquire all of the capital stock of
Data Dimensions, Lionbridge currently does not have commitments or agreements
with respect to any acquisitions. In executing its acquisition strategy,
Lionbridge may be unable to identify suitable acquisition candidates. In
addition, Lionbridge expects to face competition from other companies for
acquisition candidates, making it more difficult to acquire suitable companies
on favorable terms.

   If Lionbridge fails to keep pace with changing technologies, Lionbridge may
lose clients.

   Lionbridge's market is characterized by rapidly changing client
requirements, and evolving technologies and industry standards. If Lionbridge
cannot keep pace with these changes, its business could suffer. The Internet's
strong influence in Lionbridge's industry magnifies these characteristics. To
achieve its goals, Lionbridge needs to develop strategic business solutions and
methodologies that keep pace with continuing changes in industry standards,
information technology, and client preferences.

   If Lionbridge loses the services of its Chairman and Chief Executive
Officer, Rory J. Cowan, or other key personnel, its business and stock price
could suffer.

   In order to continue to provide quality services in its rapidly changing
business, Lionbridge believes it is particularly important to retain personnel
with experience and expertise relevant to its business. Lionbridge's future
success, therefore, depends in large part on the continued services of a number
of its key personnel, including its Chief Executive Officer, Rory J. Cowan. The
loss of the services of Mr. Cowan or any of its other key personnel could
seriously impede its success. Lionbridge might not be able to prevent key
personnel, who may leave its employ in the future, from disclosing or using its
technical knowledge, practices or procedures. One or more of its key personnel
might resign and join a competitor or form a competing company. As a result,
Lionbridge might lose existing or potential clients.

   Lionbridge competes in a highly competitive market that has low barriers to
entry.

   The market for Lionbridge's services is very competitive and faces many
competitors. Lionbridge cannot assure you that it will compete successfully
against these competitors in the future. Many of these companies have longer
operating histories, significantly greater resources, and greater name
recognition than Lionbridge. If Lionbridge fails to be competitive with these
companies in the future, it may lose market share and its revenue could fail to
grow or decline.

   There are relatively few barriers preventing companies from competing with
Lionbridge. Although Lionbridge owns proprietary technology, it does not own
any patented or other technology that precludes or inhibits others from
entering its market. As a result, new market entrants also pose a threat to its
business. In addition to its existing competitors, Lionbridge may face further
competition in the future from companies that do not currently offer testing or
globalization services. Technology companies, eBuilders, Web consulting firms,
technical support call centers, hosting companies, and content management
providers may choose to broaden their range of services to include testing or
globalization as they expand their operations internationally. While Lionbridge
currently uses translation memory software in its localization process and, to
a lesser extent, machine translation software, these technologies may improve
and become sophisticated enough to enable more companies to offer localization
services and thus to compete with Lionbridge. Lionbridge cannot assure you that
it will be able to compete effectively with these potential future competitors.

   Lionbridge will continue to depend on intellectual property rights to
protect its proprietary technologies, although it may not be able to protect
these rights.

   Lionbridge relies on its proprietary technology to deploy its service
offerings. Lionbridge's policy is to enter into confidentiality agreements with
its employees, outside consultants, and independent contractors. Lionbridge
also uses patent, trademark, trade secret, and copyright law in addition to
contractual restrictions to protect Lionbridge's technology. Notwithstanding
these precautions, it may be possible for a third party to obtain and use its
proprietary technology without authorization. Although Lionbridge holds
registered or pending United States patents and foreign patents covering
certain aspects of its technology, it cannot be sure of the level of protection
that these patents will provide. Lionbridge may have to resort to litigation to
enforce its intellectual property rights, to protect trade secrets or know-how,
or to determine their scope, validity or enforceability. Enforcing or defending
its proprietary technology is expensive, could cause diversion of its resources
and may not prove successful. The laws of other countries may afford Lionbridge
little or no effective protection of its intellectual property rights.

Risks Relating to Data Dimensions

   In determining whether to approve and adopt the merger and the agreement and
plan of reorganization, Data Dimensions stockholders should consider the
following risks relating to Data Dimensions together with the information about
Data Dimensions' business, financial condition and results of operations
provided elsewhere in this proxy statement/prospectus. If the merger is
completed, these risks will continue to apply to your investment in Lionbridge,
although to a lesser degree because Data Dimensions' business will, following
the merger, represent only a portion of the combined company's business.

   Data Dimensions is currently not profitable and has an accumulated deficit.

   Data Dimensions experienced net losses of $11.1 million from continuing
operations for the fiscal year ended 2000 due to its transition away from
providing Year 2000 ("Y2K") remediation services to providing quality assurance
and testing services and had an accumulated deficit of $2.5 million at December
31, 2000. Although Data Dimensions' quality assurance and testing revenue grew
significantly in fiscal year 2000, this growth may not be sustainable or
indicative of actual future results of operations.

   If Data Dimensions' losses continue, it will need to raise additional
capital. If it is unable to raise capital or does so on unfavorable terms, Data
Dimensions may be unable to meet its cash requirements.

   If Data Dimensions' losses continue, it will be unable to pay its expenses,
unless it raises additional capital. If Data Dimensions needs to raise
additional capital but is not able to raise the necessary funds or is able to
do so only on unfavorable terms, Data Dimensions may not be able to meet its
cash requirements necessary for the continued operation of its business as it
is currently operated.

   Delisting of Data Dimensions' common stock could negatively impact the
marketability of the stock and reduce the market price of the stock.

   Data Dimensions was notified by Nasdaq of its decision to delist Data
Dimensions' common stock due to Data Dimensions' noncompliance with Nasdaq
listing standards that require Data Dimensions to maintain a minimum bid price
of $1.00 per share. Data Dimensions requested an oral hearing to review the
decision, which request stayed the delisting. The hearing occurred on April 5,
2001 and a decision is expected within two weeks of the hearing date. Data
Dimensions cannot assure you that the outcome of the hearing will be favorable
to Data Dimensions. The delisting of Data Dimensions common stock may result
in the placement of the stock on the over-the-counter market or Nasdaq
SmallCap Market, the effect of which may limit the continuation of, or the re-
establishment of, a public trading market for the common stock which could
reduce or destabilize the stock price.

   Data Dimensions has experienced historical fluctuations in its quarterly
operating results.

   Data Dimensions has experienced, and may experience in the future,
fluctuations in quarterly operating results. Several factors may contribute to
the fluctuations in revenue, including an absence of long-term service
contracts, the number and requirements of client engagements, Data Dimensions'
ability to develop, introduce and successfully market new and enhanced
services, customers' product development cycles, and general economic
conditions which may affect customers' decisions about the extent and timing
of their spending. Additional other factors may impact Data Dimensions' gross
margins, including the number of projects and the corresponding project phase,
employee productivity, staffing mix, and salary and compensation related costs
to attract and retain qualified personnel.

   Data Dimensions could be negatively impacted by the loss of a major client
or reduction of a major project.

   Data Dimensions has depended on a limited number of clients to generate a
significant amount of its revenue. There was a shift in the composition of the
large clients from 1999 to 2000, but Data Dimensions' ten largest clients
accounted for approximately 48% and 55% of Data Dimensions' revenue in 1999
and 2000, respectively. As a result, if one or more of these clients determine
to terminate their relationship with Data Dimensions, reduce the scope of a
large project or elect not to proceed to a project stage, such action could
have a material adverse effect on Data Dimensions' financial performance and
condition.

   Data Dimensions is significantly dependent on its ability to attract and
retain skilled professionals.

   Data Dimensions' business is labor intensive and depends to a significant
extent on its ability to attract, train and retain highly skilled
professionals. Qualified skilled professionals are in great demand in the
information technology services industry and are likely to remain a limited
resource for the foreseeable future. In addition, the industry has experienced
high turnover rates. The ability of Data Dimensions to conduct operations is
significantly dependent on the availability of skilled personnel and the
ability of Data Dimensions to attract and retain these skilled employees. As a
result, Data Dimensions cannot assure you that it will be able to attract
sufficient qualified technical personnel or retain existing and future
employees.

   Data Dimensions operates in a highly competitive market with low barriers
to entry.

   The market for quality assurance and testing services is highly competitive
and Data Dimensions has many competitors. Some of Data Dimensions' competitors
have longer operating histories, significantly greater resources and greater
name recognition. If Data Dimensions fails to be competitive, its market
position and revenue could fail to grow or potentially decline.

   There are few barriers to entry preventing companies from competing in the
quality assurance and testing market. Data Dimensions does not own any patented
or other technology or process that discourages or prohibits competitors from
entering the market. In addition, information technology consulting companies,
Web consultants or others may enter the market and Data Dimensions may not be
able to compete effectively with current or potential new competitors.

   If Data Dimensions cannot keep pace with technological changes, its business
could suffer.

   The quality assurance and testing market is characterized by rapidly
changing client requirements and evolving technologies. If Data Dimensions
cannot keep pace with the technological changes, it could lose clients and its
business could suffer. The proliferation and ubiquity of software, the
Internet's continued growth and changing industry standards add to the
complexities of the market. In order to keep pace with the continuing changes,
Data Dimensions needs to develop appropriate services and methodologies. There
is no assurance that Data Dimensions can develop the appropriate services and
methodologies to adequately respond to the technological changes.

   The common stock of Data Dimensions has been subject to price and volume
fluctuations in the past and may in the future.

   Data Dimensions' common stock has been subject to extreme price and volume
fluctuations in the past. Additionally, the stock market has experienced
significant price fluctuations, particularly among technology companies, which
often have been unrelated to the operating performance of specific companies.
Any announcement of any unfavorable variance in revenue or net income from
levels generally expected from securities analysts or investors could have an
immediate and significant effect on the trading price of Data Dimensions'
common stock. In addition, announcements of technological innovations or new
services by Data Dimensions, its competitors or other third parties, rumors of
innovations or new services or products, changing market conditions in the
industry, changes in estimates by securities analysts, unusual events, or
general economic conditions may have significant impact of the market price of
Data Dimensions common stock.

   The uncertainty in the technology market could affect Data Dimensions'
ability to achieve operating plans.

   A substantial portion of Data Dimensions' revenue is derived from technology
companies, including Web-based businesses. Many technology companies have
experienced slow downs in 2000 and may experience similar slow downs in 2001
and beyond. A continued slow down in the technology market may have a negative
impact on Data Dimensions' ability to achieve its operating plans.

   On March 8, 2001, the last full trading day prior to the public announcement
of the proposed merger and the execution of the agreement and plan of
reorganization, Lionbridge common stock closed at $5.66 per share and Data
Dimensions common stock closed at $0.44 per share. On [      ], 2001, the most
recent practicable date prior to the printing of this proxy
statement/prospectus, Lionbridge common stock closed at $   per share and Data
Dimensions common stock closed at $   per share.

   Nasdaq notified Data Dimensions of its decision to delist Data Dimensions
common stock from the Nasdaq National Market System as of March 8, 2001.
Nasdaq's decision to delist was due to Data Dimensions' noncompliance with
Nasdaq listing standards that require Data Dimensions to maintain a minimum bid
price of $1.00 per share. On March 5, 2001, Data Dimensions requested, and was
granted, an oral hearing before the Nasdaq Listing Qualifications Panel to
review the decision by Nasdaq. The oral hearing occurred on April 5, 2001 and a
decision is expected within two weeks of the hearing date. The request stayed
the delisting of Data

Dimensions common stock pending the decision of the Nasdaq Listing
Qualifications Panel. There is no assurance the decision by the Nasdaq Listing
Qualifications Panel will be favorable to Data Dimensions. If delisted, Data
Dimensions' stock could be traded on either the over-the-counter market or the
Nasdaq SmallCap Market.

   Data Dimensions stockholders are urged to obtain current market quotations
for Lionbridge common stock and Data Dimensions common stock prior to making
any decisions with regard to the merger and voting their shares at the special
meeting.

   Lionbridge has not paid any cash dividends on its common stock and currently
intends to retain any future earnings for use in its business. In addition, the
terms of its credit facilities with Silicon Valley Bank prohibit the payment of
cash dividends to Lionbridge by its European subsidiaries and the terms of the
subordinated notes held by Capital Resource Lenders and two Morgan Stanley
limited partnerships prohibit Lionbridge from paying any dividends to its
stockholders. Accordingly, Lionbridge does not anticipate that any cash
dividends will be declared or paid on the common stock in the foreseeable
future. Data Dimensions has not paid cash dividends on its common stock and
does not anticipate paying cash dividends on its common stock in the
foreseeable future.

                DATA DIMENSIONS SPECIAL MEETING OF STOCKHOLDERS

General

   This proxy statement/prospectus is being furnished to stockholders of Data
Dimensions, Inc., a Delaware corporation, as part of the solicitation of
proxies by the Data Dimensions board of directors for use at a special meeting
of stockholders of Data Dimensions to be held on June  , 2001, at 9:00 a.m.
Pacific Daylight Savings Time, at Data Dimensions' executive offices at 3535
Factoria Boulevard SE, Sterling Plaza, 3rd Floor, Bellevue, Washington, and at
any adjournment or postponement of such meeting. This proxy statement/
prospectus and the proxy card are first being mailed to stockholders of Data
Dimensions on or about       , 2001.

Matters to be Considered

   The purpose of the Data Dimensions special meeting is:

     1. To approve and adopt the merger and the agreement and plan of
  reorganization, dated as of March 8, 2001, as amended, by and among
  Lionbridge Technologies, Inc., a Delaware corporation, Diamond Acquisition
  Corp., a Delaware corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of Lionbridge,
  and Data Dimensions pursuant to which Diamond Acquisition Corp. will be
  merged with and into Data Dimensions, with Data Dimensions being the
  surviving corporation and becoming a wholly owned subsidiary of Lionbridge;
  and

     2. To consider and act upon any other matter which may properly come
  before the special meeting and any adjournment or postponement of the Data
  Dimensions special meeting, including without limitation, potential
  adjournments or postponements of the Data Dimensions special meeting for
  the purpose of soliciting additional proxies in order to approve the merger
  and the agreement and plan of reorganization.

Data Dimensions Board of Directors' Recommendation

   The Data Dimensions board of directors, after careful consideration, has
approved the merger and the agreement and plan of reorganization and has
determined that the merger and the agreement and plan of reorganization are
fair to, and in the best interest of, Data Dimensions and its stockholders. The
Data Dimensions board of directors recommends a vote FOR the approval and
adoption of the merger and the agreement and plan of reorganization.

Record Date and Voting

   Holders of record of shares of Data Dimensions common stock at the close of
business on       , 2001, referred to in this proxy statement/prospectus as the
record date, are entitled to notice of and to vote at the Data Dimensions
special meeting. On the record date, there were [13,560,972] outstanding shares
of Data Dimensions common stock, each of which will be entitled to one vote.
The representation, in person or by properly executed proxy, of the holders of
a majority of all the shares of common stock entitled to vote at the Data
Dimensions special meeting is necessary to constitute a quorum at the Data
Dimensions special meeting. If you sign and send in your proxy card and do not
indicate how you want to vote, it will be voted in favor of approval of the
merger and the agreement and plan of reorganization.

   Under Delaware law, the charter documents of Data Dimensions and the
applicable rules of the Nasdaq National Market, approval of the merger and the
agreement and plan of reorganization requires the affirmative vote of a
majority of the votes entitled to be cast by holders of outstanding shares of
Data Dimensions common stock on the record date.

   If a quorum is present at the special meeting, the affirmative vote of the
holders of a majority of the shares of Data Dimensions common stock outstanding
is required for the approval and adoption of the merger and the agreement and
plan of reorganization. Shares of Data Dimensions common stock represented in
person or by

proxy will be counted for the purposes of determining whether a quorum is
present at the Data Dimensions special meeting. Abstentions from voting
identified as such on the proxy card and broker non-votes are treated as
present or represented for purposes of determining the presence or absence of a
quorum at the special meeting. Brokers and other "street name" nominees holding
shares for the account of the beneficial owner of shares generally may vote the
shares in their own discretion. However, brokers and nominees generally do not
have authority to vote for "non-routine" proposals without receiving voting
instructions with respect to such proposals from the beneficial owners of such
shares. The proposal to approve the merger and the agreement and plan of
reorganization is a "non-routine" proposal and consequently requires voting
instructions from the beneficial owner so that the shares may be voted by the
beneficial owner's broker or nominee. A "broker non-vote" will occur if a
broker or nominee does not receive instructions from the beneficial owners with
respect to the proposal to approve the merger and the agreement and plan of
reorganization. Accordingly, abstentions and broker non-votes will have the
same effect as votes against the merger and the agreement and plan of
reorganization.

   As of March 8, 2001, the directors and executive officers and 10%
stockholders of Data Dimensions and their affiliates who collectively
beneficially own approximately 18.9% of the outstanding shares of Data
Dimensions have already agreed under voting agreements to vote in favor of the
approval and adoption of the merger and the agreement and plan of
reorganization. For more information, see "The Voting Agreements" on page 52.

Voting and Revocation of Proxies

   All shares of Data Dimensions common stock which are entitled to vote and
are represented at the Data Dimensions special meeting by properly executed
proxies received prior to or at such meeting, and not revoked, will be voted at
such meeting in accordance with the instructions indicated on such proxies. If
no instruction is indicated (other than broker non-votes), such proxies will be
voted FOR approval and adoption of the merger and the agreement and plan of
reorganization.

   The Data Dimensions board of directors does not know of any matters other
than those described in the Notice of the Data Dimensions special meeting that
are to come before such meeting. If any other matters are properly presented at
the Data Dimensions special meeting for consideration, including, among other
things, consideration of a motion to adjourn or postpone such meeting to
another time and/or place (including, without limitation, for the purposes of
soliciting additional proxies or allowing additional time for the satisfaction
of conditions to the merger), the persons named in the enclosed proxy card and
acting thereunder generally will have discretion to vote on such matters in
accordance with their best judgment.

   Any proxy given pursuant to the solicitation may be revoked by the person
giving it at any time before it is voted. Proxies may be revoked by (i) filing
with the Secretary of Data Dimensions, at or before the taking of a vote at the
Data Dimensions special meeting, a written notice of revocation bearing a later
date then the proxy, (ii) duly executing a later dated proxy relating to the
same shares and delivering it to the Secretary of Data Dimensions before the
taking of the vote at the Data Dimensions special meeting, or (iii) attending
the Data Dimensions special meeting and voting in person (although attendance
at the Data Dimensions special meeting will not in and of itself constitute a
revocation of a proxy). Any written notice of revocation or subsequent proxy
should be sent to Data Dimensions, Inc., 3535 Factoria Boulevard SE, Sterling
Plaza, 3rd Floor, Bellevue, Washington 98006, Attn: Secretary, or hand-
delivered to the Secretary of Data Dimensions at or before the taking of the
vote at the Data Dimensions special meeting. Stockholders that have instructed
a broker to vote their shares must follow directions received from such broker
in order to change their vote or to vote at the Data Dimensions special
meeting.

   All expenses of Data Dimensions' solicitation of proxies for the Data
Dimensions special meeting will be borne by Data Dimensions. In addition to
solicitation by use of the mails, proxies may be solicited from Data Dimensions
stockholders by directors, officers and employees of Data Dimensions in person
or by telephone, facsimile or other means of communication. Such directors,
officers and employees will not be additionally compensated, but may be
reimbursed for reasonable out-of-pocket expenses in connection with such

solicitation. Arrangements will also be made with brokerage houses, custodians,
nominees and fiduciaries for forwarding of proxy solicitation materials to
beneficial owners of shares held of record by such brokerage houses,
custodians, nominees and fiduciaries, and Data Dimensions will reimburse such
brokerage houses, custodians, nominees and fiduciaries for their reasonable
expenses incurred in connection therewith. In addition to this solicitation,
Data Dimensions has retained Mellon Investor Services LLC to assist in the
distribution and solicitation of proxies. Data Dimensions will pay Mellon
Investor Services LLC a fee of $7,500, plus $5.00 for each telephone
solicitation, plus expenses for these services.

                                   THE MERGER

Background of the Merger

   On September 26, 2000, the board of directors of Data Dimensions retained
Updata Capital, an investment banking firm, to act as its financial advisor in
connection with evaluating strategic alternatives, including, but not limited
to, a sale or merger of Data Dimensions, a sale of one or more of its then
three business units, or a recapitalization of Data Dimensions and assisting
Data Dimensions management in the consummation of strategic alternatives
approved by its board of directors.

   At a meeting of the Data Dimensions board of directors on October 16, 2000,
after performing due diligence regarding Data Dimensions, Updata Capital
provided the Data Dimensions board of directors with a preliminary assessment
of various strategic alternatives available to Data Dimensions, including
actions to improve Data Dimensions' financial position and operations, possible
sales of business units and the sale of the entire company. Updata Capital also
provided the Data Dimensions board of directors with information about
financial market conditions, valuations in the information technology services
sector and a plan for evaluating the feasibility and merits of potential
transactions related to divestitures, acquisitions and a recapitalization. At
this meeting, the Data Dimensions board authorized Updata Capital to contact
parties potentially interested in considering transactions involving Data
Dimensions' business units.

   From mid October to early November, Updata Capital, with assistance from
Data Dimensions, management, prepared memoranda describing each business unit
and developed a list of potential acquirers of each business unit and Data
Dimensions as a whole. Shortly thereafter, Updata Capital began contacting
potentially interested parties. Lionbridge was among the entities contacted by
Updata Capital.

   Lionbridge regularly reviews private and public companies which it may
acquire to further its objectives in the globalization services market. On
November 16, 2000, Don More, Senior Vice President of Updata Capital, called
Stephen J. Lifshatz, Senior Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and
Treasurer of Lionbridge, to inform him that he represented a company that was
potentially looking for a strategic buyer for one or more of its business
units. Mr. Lifshatz indicated Lionbridge's interest in learning more about the
company represented by Updata Capital, and Lionbridge and Data Dimensions
executed a confidentiality agreement on November 17, 2000 in order to receive
from Updata Capital a confidential offering memorandum relating to Data
Dimensions.

   Upon receipt of the confidential offering memorandum on November 21, 2000,
Mr. Lifshatz, along with Rory J. Cowan, the Chairman and Chief Executive
Officer of Lionbridge, commenced internal company discussions regarding the
possibility of a strategic combination with Data Dimensions and the various
structures of a combination. In addition, Lionbridge commenced initial,
internal due diligence activities through an analysis of publicly available
materials.

   On November 29, 2001, Updata Capital arranged an introductory telephone
conference for executives of Data Dimensions and Lionbridge to describe the
business and operations of each company. Mr. Cowan, Peter A. Allen, Chairman
and Chief Executive Officer of Data Dimensions, Laurence C. Leslie, Executive
Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of Data Dimensions, and Jim
McLendon, Vice President Investor Relations and Corporate Development of Data
Dimensions, participated in this telephone conference.

   On December 7, 2000, Mr. Lifshatz had a telephone conversation with Mr. More
to request additional information about Data Dimensions in order for Lionbridge
to submit an indication of interest. In addition, during the first two weeks of
December 2000, Mr. Cowan and Mr. Allen had additional telephone conversations
regarding the possibility of a strategic combination of the companies.

   On December 12, 2000, at a regular meeting of the board of directors of Data
Dimensions, Updata Capital reviewed Data Dimensions' strategic alternatives and
updated market valuation data, and discussed the status of its canvassing
effort. At this meeting, Data Dimensions' board of directors, together with
senior management of

Data Dimensions, Updata Capital and Garvey, Schubert & Barer, Data Dimensions'
outside legal counsel, held an extensive discussion regarding the relative
merits and risks of a sale of Data Dimensions' business units and/or a sale of
the entire company. Garvey, Schubert & Barer outlined the directors' legal
duties and responsibilities in connection with considering these transactions.
The board of directors authorized Updata Capital to continue its efforts and
reviewed a timetable for Updata Capital to solicit indications of interest from
parties interested in such a transaction.

   On January 8, 2001, Mr. Cowan and Roger Jeanty, Lionbridge's President, met
with Messrs. Allen, McLendon, and Leslie, at Data Dimensions' headquarters in
Bellevue, Washington. At this meeting, the parties discussed various aspects of
Data Dimensions' business, including its financial condition and business
prospects, its technological capabilities, and an assessment of Data
Dimensions' personnel. The parties also discussed the potential synergies of a
strategic combination of the companies.

   Following the January 8 meeting, the parties continued telephone
conversations and, at the request of Lionbridge, Data Dimensions sent
additional due diligence materials to Lionbridge. During the weeks beginning
January 8 and January 15, 2001, Lionbridge received additional information from
Data Dimensions.

   On January 16, 2001, Mr. Lifshatz had a telephone conference with Messrs.
Allen, McLendon and Leslie, during which the Data Dimensions executives
presented a detailed overview of the Data Dimensions business. On January 25,
2001, Mr. Lifshatz and Boris Zverev, Lionbridge's Manager of Financial Planning
and Analysis, had a subsequent telephone conference with Messrs. Allen,
McLendon and Leslie during which Data Dimensions' financial projections for the
first quarter of 2001 and fiscal year 2001 were discussed.

   On January 30, 2001, Mr. Cowan sent Mr. Allen a letter outlining some of the
benefits and synergies that could result from a combination of the two
companies. Following up on this letter, on January 31, 2001, Lionbridge
provided Data Dimensions and Updata Capital with a formal indication of
interest in a merger with Data Dimensions.

   On the evening of January 31, 2001, during a dinner meeting in Boston,
Massachusetts, Mr. Cowan informed the board of directors of Lionbridge's
discussions with Data Dimensions and the potential of a strategic combination.

   On February 1, 2001, the Lionbridge board of directors met in a regularly
scheduled meeting during which Messrs. Cowan and Lifshatz discussed the results
of their due diligence investigations of Data Dimensions, and various methods
by which Lionbridge might effect a strategic combination with Data Dimensions.
The board of directors authorized its executive officers to proceed with
negotiations with Data Dimensions subject to its review of the proposed
definitive terms of a strategic combination with Data Dimensions.

   On February 1, 2001, the Data Dimensions board of directors held a special
meeting at which Updata Capital and Data Dimensions' management reported on
indications of interest from various parties, including Lionbridge. In
addition, the board, Updata Capital and Data Dimensions' management reviewed
the status of discussions with other parties and alternatives to a sale, as
well as the timing, risk and other issues associated with each alternative
available to Data Dimensions. Updata Capital provided the board of directors
with information about the business and management of Lionbridge. Mr. Allen
reviewed his meeting of January 8 with Mr. Cowan and Mr. Jeanty. After
discussion, the board of directors of Data Dimensions requested Updata Capital
to continue negotiations with Lionbridge to improve the terms of Lionbridge's
indication of interest while also maintaining communications with the other
interested parties.

   On February 5, 2001, Mr. Lifshatz, together with Cindy Rinchich,
Lionbridge's Controller of VeriTest operations, had a telephone conversation
with Mr. Leslie to further discuss Data Dimensions' financial information. On
February 6, 2001, Data Dimensions provided Lionbridge with data regarding its
significant stockholders as well as a detailed budget for Data Dimensions.

   During the weeks of February 5 and February 12, 2001, Lionbridge, Data
Dimensions and Updata Capital had numerous discussions with respect to the
principal terms that an acquisition could take.

   On February 9, 2001, the board of directors of Data Dimensions held a
special meeting to review the status of discussions with Lionbridge and to
consider the status of the other indications of interest and strategic
alternatives available to Data Dimensions. Updata Capital and Garvey, Schubert
& Barer reviewed changes to Lionbridge's proposal from the prior meeting.
Management and Updata Capital provided background information on the parties'
discussions and outlined the benefits and risks of a proposed merger with
Lionbridge. Updata Capital provided the board of directors with information
concerning the business, management and financial condition of Lionbridge.
Representatives of Updata Capital and Garvey, Schubert & Barer reviewed and
discussed with the Data Dimensions board of directors the material items
included in the revised proposal presented by Lionbridge. In particular, the
Data Dimensions board of directors reviewed the proposed termination fee,
agreement not to entertain alternative proposals and the fixed exchange ratio.
Management and Updata Capital also reviewed the status of the other indications
of interest and strategic alternatives available to Data Dimensions. After a
discussion of the terms proposed by Lionbridge, the Data Dimensions board of
directors authorized management of Data Dimensions and Updata Capital to
continue discussions with Lionbridge and to conduct due diligence to determine
the merits and terms of an agreement and plan of reorganization.

   On February 20, 2001, Testa, Hurwitz & Thibeault, LLP, outside legal counsel
to Lionbridge, delivered a draft agreement and plan of reorganization to Data
Dimensions and its financial and legal advisors. On February 22, 2001, Testa,
Hurwitz & Thibeault, LLP delivered a draft of the voting agreement and the
stock option agreement to Data Dimensions and its financial and legal advisors.

   Between February 20 and February 23, 2001, a due diligence team from
Lionbridge met with Data Dimensions management for due diligence discussions at
the offices of Garvey, Schubert & Barer in Seattle, Washington. At these
meetings, the companies discussed, among other things, the companies'
accounting and other policies, operational issues associated with a potential
business combination and opportunities for the combined entity. In addition,
Mr. Cowan met with Mr. Allen to discuss the business of each entity and the
strategic benefits of a combination in more detail. Mr. Allen and Updata
Capital also met with Larry Martin, the owner of approximately 14.65% of Data
Dimensions' outstanding stock, to describe the potential combination between
the two companies. Mr. Martin executed a nondisclosure agreement governing
these discussions.

   From February 20 through March 8, 2001, Lionbridge and Data Dimensions and
the respective financial and legal advisors for Lionbridge and Data Dimensions
continued their respective business, legal, accounting and financial due
diligence and negotiated the terms of the agreement and the plan of
reorganization and related documents. Mr. Leslie met with Mr. Lifshatz and
James Bampos, Lionbridge's Senior Vice President, Worldwide Testing Services
and General Manager of VeriTest, at Lionbridge's headquarters in Waltham,
Massachusetts on March 3, 2001 to review Lionbridge's financial condition,
business and prospects, and visited a Lionbridge facility at that time. Also,
as part of Data Dimensions' due diligence, on February 26 and 27, 2001,
representatives of Updata Capital met with Mr. Cowan, Mr. Lifshatz and Mr.
Bampos at Lionbridge's headquarters.

   On March 7, 2001, at a special meeting of the board of directors of Data
Dimensions, the management of Data Dimensions reported on the business terms of
the proposed merger, the results of due diligence and business integration
issues. Garvey, Schubert & Barer reviewed the material terms of the proposed
transaction, the agreement and plan of reorganization and related agreements
and further advised the board of directors of its fiduciary duties. In
particular, the Data Dimensions board of directors reviewed the proposed
termination fee, agreement not to entertain alternative transactions and
termination rights, as well as other terms. Representatives of Updata Capital
made a presentation to the Data Dimensions board of directors regarding its due
diligence review of Lionbridge, the financial analyses Updata Capital and Data
Dimensions management had performed regarding Data Dimensions, Lionbridge and
the merger, and various considerations relating

to the merger. Updata Capital rendered an oral opinion, subsequently confirmed
by delivery to the Data Dimensions board of directors of a written opinion
dated March 8, 2001, that, as of that date, the conversion ratio provided in
the agreement and plan of reorganization was fair to Data Dimensions
stockholders from a financial point of view. The members of Data Dimensions'
board of directors present at the special meeting unanimously approved the
final terms of the merger. One member of the Data Dimensions board of directors
was unable to attend due to a family emergency, but all other directors were in
attendance. In light of the prior discussions and meetings of the board of
directors and the presentations and the discussions at the current meeting, the
board of directors determined that the transactions contemplated by the
agreement and plan of reorganization and related documents were in the best
interests of Data Dimensions and its stockholders, approved the merger and the
agreement and plan of reorganization and related agreements and determined to
recommend that Data Dimensions' stockholders vote to approve the proposed
transaction.

   On March 8, 2001, at a special meeting of the Lionbridge board of directors,
Lionbridge management reported on the status of the merger discussions with
Data Dimensions, and the Lionbridge board of directors discussed various issues
relating to the proposed business combination. The board of directors
considered and voted upon the proposed agreement and plan of reorganization and
related transactions. At that meeting, Mr. Cowan presented an overview of the
transaction and Testa, Hurwitz & Thibeault, LLP made a presentation regarding
the significant terms of the proposed merger and the agreement and plan of
reorganization. Following these presentations and further discussion, the
Lionbridge board of directors approved the execution of the agreement and plan
of reorganization and related agreements.

   The final agreement was signed after the Lionbridge and Data Dimensions
board of directors meetings and a joint press release announcing the proposed
acquisition was issued on March 8, 2001.

Lionbridge's Reasons for the Merger

   The Lionbridge board of directors believes that the combined company will
have potential for greater market share and growth in the outsourced testing
services industry than either Lionbridge or Data Dimensions would have on its
own. The Lionbridge board of directors identified a number of potential
benefits to the merger which it believes could contribute to the success of the
combined company and thus benefit Lionbridge stockholders, including the
following:

  .  The merger will enhance the opportunity for Lionbridge to realize its
     strategic objectives of expanding its market share and increasing its
     ability to compete effectively as a provider of comprehensive outsourced
     testing services to the global technology industry;

  .  Through the merger, Lionbridge will acquire or enhance its ability to
     provide software testing, quality assurance consulting services, on-site
     training for test planning, and application development and maintenance
     services, and thus provide a broader range and expanded scope of testing
     and service offerings to its customers;

  .  The combination of Lionbridge's globalization services with Data
     Dimensions' testing, consulting, and applications maintenance services
     will enable Lionbridge to provide an integrated and comprehensive
     testing, certification and globalization solution for its customers;

  .  Acquiring Data Dimensions will allow Lionbridge to increase its testing
     labs from five to a total of 10, with six labs in the United States and
     four labs outside of the United States, and thereby increase its ability
     to rapidly and efficiently meet the needs of its global customers; and

  .  The combined businesses will bring Lionbridge additional geographic
     coverage, management depth, technical and project management resources
     to Lionbridge to address larger and more varied client projects, and
     economies of scale.

  .  The combined businesses will enhance Lionbridge's technical testing
     staff by adding additional personnel with testing expertise and
     experience.

   Lionbridge's board of directors also considered the following when assessing
the transaction:

  .  Historical information concerning the business operations, positions and
     results of operations, technology and management style, competitive
     position, industry trends and prospects of Data Dimensions and
     Lionbridge;

  .  Information contained in SEC filings by Data Dimensions;

  .  Current and historical market prices, volatility and trading data from
     the two companies;

  .  Information and advice based on due diligence investigations by members
     of management and Lionbridge's legal, financial and accounting advisors
     concerning the business, business trends, technology, services,
     operations, properties, assets, financial condition, operating results
     and prospects of Data Dimensions, and the expertise and capabilities of
     Data Dimensions' management team; and

  .  Data on companies comparable to Data Dimensions and other financial
     analyses.

   Except as outlined above, Lionbridge's board of directors did not find it
practicable to quantify, analyze or assign relative weights to each individual
factor to reach its determination. Individual members of Lionbridge's board of
directors may have assigned different relative weights or conclusions to each
factor affecting the board's determination.

Recommendation of the Board of Directors of Data Dimensions; Data Dimensions'
Reasons for the Merger

   DATA DIMENSIONS' BOARD OF DIRECTORS HAS APPROVED THE MERGER AND THE
AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF REORGANIZATION AND THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED THEREBY
AND BELIEVES THE TERMS OF THE MERGER ARE FAIR TO, AND IN THE BEST INTERESTS OF,
DATA DIMENSIONS AND ITS STOCKHOLDERS. THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS OF DATA DIMENSIONS
RECOMMENDS A VOTE FOR THE APPROVAL AND ADOPTION OF THE MERGER AND THE AGREEMENT
AND PLAN OF REORGANIZATION.

   Data Dimensions' board of directors believes that the merger with Lionbridge
will create a combined company with greater financial resources and business
opportunities than Data Dimensions would likely be able to achieve alone. Data
Dimensions' board of directors has considered several alternative means to
enhance stockholder value, including other potential business combinations, the
restructuring and/or sale of individual business units, as well as the sale of
the entire company. After consultation with Updata Capital, Data Dimensions'
financial advisor, and executive management of Data Dimensions, Data
Dimensions' board of directors concluded that the terms of the agreement and
plan of reorganization were fair to, and in the best interests of, Data
Dimensions and its stockholders.

   Data Dimensions' board of directors reviewed with its financial and legal
advisors the following additional material factors in reaching its conclusion:

  .  The merger affords the new combined company the opportunity to create
     one of the largest application testing services businesses and enables
     it to offer its customers a broader array of products and services from
     more locations;

  .  The merger has the potential to create a company with greater critical
     mass that is better positioned to compete for business opportunities and
     participate in industry growth;

  .  The potential cost synergies offered by the merger through consolidation
     and integration of certain operations and functions;

  .  The merger may provide Data Dimensions' stockholders with an opportunity
     to receive a premium over the market price for their Data Dimensions
     common stock immediately prior to the merger. However, this premium is
     subject to fluctuations in the price of Lionbridge common stock. For
     more information, see "Comparative Stock Prices and Dividend Policy" on
     page 23;

  .  The expectation that the merger will qualify as a tax-free
     reorganization under federal tax law;

  .  The presentation by Updata Capital to Data Dimensions' board of
     directors, as well as Updata Capital's fairness opinion dated March 8,
     2001, stating that, as of that date, the conversion ratio is fair to
     Data Dimensions stockholders;

  .  Increased liquidity for Data Dimensions stockholders through continued
     listing of Lionbridge common stock on the Nasdaq National Market; and

  .  The merger will provide Data Dimensions stockholders with the
     opportunity to share in the combined company's long-term growth.

   In addition to the factors set forth above, Data Dimensions' board of
directors reviewed and considered a wide range of information relevant to the
merger, including:

  .  Information concerning Data Dimensions' and Lionbridge's respective
     businesses, historical financial performance and condition, operations,
     technology, products, customers, competitive positions, prospects and
     management;

  .  Reports from management and financial advisors as to the results of
     their due diligence investigation of Lionbridge;

  .  Estimates of future financial results of the two companies illustrating
     the potential financial results of the combined company;

  .  The view of Data Dimensions' management and board as to the long-term
     opportunities and prospects of Data Dimensions as an independent entity
     and of Data Dimensions and Lionbridge as a combined company; and

  .  The belief that the terms of the agreement and plan of reorganization,
     including the parties' representations, warranties and covenants, and
     the conditions to their respective obligations, are reasonable.

   Data Dimensions' board of directors also considered the following
potentially negative factors:

  .  The risk of establishing a fixed conversion ratio;

  .  The loss of control over Data Dimensions' future operations following
     the merger;

  .  Under the terms of the agreement and plan of reorganization, Data
     Dimensions cannot solicit other proposals regarding business
     combinations and must pay a termination fee of $600,000 under certain
     circumstances and be subject to dilution relating to the stock option
     granted to Lionbridge. For more information, see "The Agreement and Plan
     of Reorganization--Termination; Fees and Expenses" and "The Stock Option
     Agreement" on pages 50 and 52, respectively, of this proxy
     statement/prospectus;

  .  Both companies have had negative earnings per share and negative cash
     flow, and the combined company would have significant liquidity
     requirements. For more information, see "Description of Lionbridge--
     Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results
     of Operations" on page 61 of this proxy statement/prospectus;

  .  The risk that the combined company might not realize the anticipated
     cost savings and revenue synergies; and

  .  The other risks described under "Risk Factors" beginning on page 9 of
     this proxy statement/prospectus.

   In light of the extensive variety of factors, both positive and negative,
considered by Data Dimensions' board of directors, the board did not find it
practical to quantify or otherwise assign relative weight to the specific
factors considered in making its determination. However, after taking into
account all of the factors set forth above, Data Dimensions' board of directors
agreed that the merger is fair to, and in the best interests of, Data
Dimensions and its stockholders.

Opinion of Data Dimensions' Financial Advisor

   Pursuant to an engagement letter dated September 25, 2000, Data Dimensions
engaged Updata Capital to act as its financial advisor in connection with
evaluating strategic alternatives, including but not limited to a sale or
merger of Data Dimensions, a sale of one or more of its then three business
units, or a recapitalization of Data Dimensions, and assisting Data Dimensions
senior management in the consummation of strategic alternatives approved by the
Data Dimensions board of directors. Updata Capital, as part of its investment
banking services, is regularly engaged in the valuation of information
technology companies and their securities in connection with mergers and
acquisitions and other strategic transactions. Data Dimensions' board of
directors selected Updata Capital based on its qualifications, expertise and
experience with regard to the information technology industry.

   On March 7, 2001, Updata Capital rendered its oral opinion, confirmed by
delivery of a written opinion dated March 8, 2001 to the Data Dimensions board
of directors that, as of the date of such opinion and subject to the
assumptions, limitations and qualifications set forth in such opinion, the
conversion ratio to be used to determine the number of shares of Lionbridge
common stock to be received by the Data Dimensions stockholders in the merger
is fair to the Data Dimensions stockholders from a financial point of view. The
full text of the written opinion of Updata Capital addressed to the board of
directors is attached as Annex D to the proxy statement/prospectus and should
be read carefully and in its entirety by Data Dimensions stockholders.

   In rendering its opinion, Updata Capital, among other things:

  .  reviewed advanced drafts of the agreement and plan of reorganization,
     the voting agreements and the stock option agreement, and based its
     opinion on the understanding that the terms and conditions of these
     agreements would not materially change;

  .  reviewed Data Dimensions' and Lionbridge's respective historical and
     projected financial statements and operating information;

  .  participated in discussions with selected senior management of Data
     Dimensions and Lionbridge concerning the operations, business strategy,
     financial performance and prospects of Data Dimensions and Lionbridge;

  .  reviewed recent reported closing prices and trading activity for Data
     Dimensions and Lionbridge common stock;

  .  compared certain aspects of the financial and market performance of Data
     Dimensions and Lionbridge with public companies deemed comparable in
     whole or in part;

  .  analyzed available information, both public and private, concerning
     other mergers and acquisitions comparable in whole or in part to the
     merger;

  .  reviewed certain publicly available financial statements and other
     information of Data Dimensions and Lionbridge, and Data Dimensions'
     unaudited financial statements for the fiscal year ended December 31,
     2000;

  .  assessed, based on discussions with Data Dimensions' and Lionbridge's
     senior management, the strategic rationale for the merger;

  .  participated in discussions and negotiations among representatives of
     Data Dimensions and Lionbridge and their legal advisors; and

  .  conducted other financial studies, analyses and investigations as Updata
     Capital deemed appropriate for purposes of the opinion.

   Updata Capital relied, without independent verification, on the accuracy and
completeness of all the financial and other information, including without
limitation the representations and warranties contained in the

agreement and plan of reorganization, that was publicly available or furnished
to it by Data Dimensions or Lionbridge. With respect to financial projections,
Updata Capital assumed that they were reasonably prepared and reflected the
best available estimates and good faith judgments of company management as to
the future performance of Data Dimensions and Lionbridge. Analyses based upon
projections of future results are not necessarily indicative of actual future
results, which may be significantly more or less favorable than suggested by
these analyses. Because these analyses are inherently subject to uncertainty,
being based upon numerous factors or events beyond the control of the parties
or their respective advisors, none of Data Dimensions, Updata Capital or any
other person assumes responsibility if future results are materially different
from those projected. Updata Capital has neither made nor obtained an
independent appraisal or valuation of any of Data Dimensions' assets.

   The opinion provided by Updata Capital speaks only as of March 8, 2001 and
does not constitute a recommendation to any of Data Dimensions' stockholders,
nor should it relied upon as such, as to how such stockholder should vote on
the merger. In its opinion, Updata Capital assumed that the merger will be
treated as a tax-free reorganization pursuant to the Internal Revenue Code of
1986.

   In connection with preparing and rendering its opinion, Updata Capital
performed a variety of valuation, financial and comparative analyses. The
summary of the material analyses set forth below does not purport to be a
complete description. The summary of the opinion of Updata Capital set forth in
this proxy statement/prospectus is qualified in its entirety by reference to
the full text of the opinion set forth in Annex D to this proxy
statement/prospectus. The preparation of a fairness opinion is a complex
process not necessarily susceptible to summary description. Selecting portions
of the analyses or of the summary, without considering the analysis as a whole,
could create an incomplete view of Updata Capital's process for arriving at its
opinion.

   Updata Capital's opinion is necessarily based upon market, economic,
financial and other conditions as they existed and can be evaluated as of the
date of the opinion and any subsequent change in such conditions would require
a reevaluation of such opinion. Although subsequent developments may affect its
opinion, Updata Capital has assumed no obligation to update, revise or reaffirm
it.

   The following is a brief summary of the material financial analyses
performed by Updata Capital in connection with providing its opinion to the
Data Dimensions board of directors.

   Analysis of Selected Publicly Traded Companies. This analysis reviews Data
Dimensions' operating performance and outlook relative to a group of peer
companies to determine an implied value. Using published estimates, Updata
Capital used multiples of Net Enterprise Value over calendar year 2000,
calendar year 2001 and run-rate revenues and EBIT, which means earnings before
interest and taxes, in its analysis. Net Enterprise Value represents a
company's current stock price multiplied by its diluted shares outstanding,
plus debt and preferred stock, minus cash and cash equivalents on the most
recent publicly available balance sheet. Run rate results are derived by
annualizing the most recent reported quarter.

   Updata Capital analyzed comparable public companies to Data Dimensions in
two ways: (1) on a consolidated basis by using a universe of selected
information technology services firms offering a range of services, some of
which overlap with Data Dimensions; and (2) on a business line basis by
creating a separate universe of companies with operations comparable in whole
or in part to each of Data Dimensions' two business units--Testing and Quality
Assurance, and Applications Development and Maintenance--and adding together
the implied valuations of each of these units to get an implied valuation for
Data Dimensions in its entirety. Updata Capital used closing per share prices
as of March 2, 2001 in its calculations, and discounted trading multiples to
reflect liquidity and certain risk factors and limitations associated with the
Data Dimensions businesses.

   The publicly traded information technology services companies selected as
comparables to Data Dimensions on a consolidated basis consisted of: Cambridge
Technology Partners, Inc.; Covansys; Computer Horizons Corp.; Computer Task
Group, Inc.; Keane, Inc.; Information Analysis Inc.; iGATE Capital Corp.;

Peritus Software Service, Inc.; Syntel, Inc.; and TSR, Inc. The publicly traded
companies selected as comparables for Data Dimensions' Testing and Quality
Assurance business unit consisted of: Compuware Corp.; Keynote Systems, Inc.;
Lionbridge Technologies, Inc.; Mercury Interactive Corp.; Rational Software
Corp.; Segue Software, Inc.; and Empirix. The publicly traded companies
selected as comparables for Data Dimensions' Applications Development and
Maintenance business unit consisted of: Affiliated Computer Systems, Inc.;
Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp.; Covansys; Computer Horizons Corp.;
Computer Task Group, Inc.; iGATE Capital Corp.; IMRglobal Corp.; Keane, Inc.;
and Syntel, Inc.

   Updata Capital determined discounted mean and median revenue and EBIT
trading multiples for these companies, excluding outliers, not meaningful and
not available data. Although Updata Capital reviewed EBIT multiples, implied
valuations presented to the Data Dimensions board of directors focused on
revenue multiples because Data Dimensions generated negative EBIT in 2000 and
management forecasts relating to Data Dimensions also projected negative EBIT
in 2001; further, most of the public comparables either had negative or minimal
EBIT, or projections were not publicly available. Mean and median Net
Enterprise Value/revenue multiples for the companies deemed comparable to Data
Dimensions on a consolidated basis resulted in a range of implied value per
Data Dimensions share of $0.57 to $0.98. Mean and median Net Enterprise
Value/revenue multiples for the companies deemed comparable to each of Data
Dimensions' two business units yielded aggregate implied Data Dimensions per
share valuations ranging from $1.13 to $1.53. Note that this latter valuation
range assumes no tax liability from a divisional asset sale, which could
substantially reduce the implied per share value on a post corporate tax basis.

   Analysis of Selected Transactions. Updata Capital reviewed selected public
and private acquisitions of information technology testing and quality
assurance companies, and of application development and maintenance companies.
For each transaction, Updata Capital calculated multiples at closing based on
transaction value, which is equivalent to Net Enterprise Value, over last 12
month, or LTM, revenues and LTM EBIT, where data was available and meaningful.

   Acquisitions included by Updata Capital and for which data was available in
the information technology testing and quality assurance sector were: Keynote
System Inc.'s acquisition of Velogic, Inc. in May 2000; Exodus Communications,
Inc.'s acquisition of Keylabs, Inc. in February 2000; Exodus Communications,
Inc.'s acquisition of Service Metrics Inc. in November 1999; Lionbridge
Technologies Inc.'s acquisition of VeriTest in January 1999; Segue Software,
Inc.'s acquisition of Black & White Software, Inc. in December 1998; and
Rational Software Corp.'s acquisition of Performance Awareness Corp. in March
1997. Acquisitions included by Updata Capital and for which data was available
in the application development and maintenance sector were: Silverline
Technologies Ltd.'s acquisition of SeraNova, Inc. in February 2001; NCR Corp.'s
acquisition of 4Front Technologies Inc. in August 2000; Titan Corp.'s
acquisition of AverStar, Inc. in June 2000; FinTech Services Ltd.'s acquisition
of Saltus Technology in June 2000; Leapnet Inc.'s acquisition of SPR Inc. in
May 2000; SI International Inc.'s acquisition of System Technology Associates
in March 2000; IMRglobal Corp.'s acquisition of Neverdahl-Loft & Associates in
December 1999; Computer Associates International, Inc.'s acquisition of
Computer Management Sciences, Inc. in March 1999; and Complete Business
Solutions, Inc.'s acquisition of Costello & Associates, Inc. in January 1998.

   It should be noted that none of the precedent transactions are identical to
the Lionbridge-Data Dimensions merger and that, therefore, there are numerous
factors that may have impacted the resulting transaction multiples that would
affect the implied valuation of Data Dimensions.

   Although Updata Capital reviewed EBIT multiples where available, implied
valuations were presented to the Data Dimensions board based upon transaction
value/LTM revenue multiples because Data Dimensions generated negative EBIT in
2000; further, most of the acquisition comparables reviewed either had negative
EBIT or EBIT data that was not publicly available. Applying mean and median
revenue multiples based upon the transactions analyzed for each of Data
Dimensions' two business units and aggregating those implied valuations
resulted in an implied value per share of Data Dimensions of $1.68. Note that
this implied valuation

assumes no tax liability from a divisional asset sale, which could
substantially reduce the implied per share value on a post corporate tax basis.

   Analysis of Premiums Paid in Selected Transactions. Updata Capital reviewed
premiums paid in 17 mergers and acquisitions of publicly traded information
technology services companies at one day and thirty days prior to the
announcement of such transactions. The median premiums paid over target's stock
price one day and 30 days prior to announcement were, in both cases, 35%. The
average premiums paid over target's stock price one day and 30 days prior to
announcement were 37% and 44%, respectively. As of March 2, 2001, these mean
and median premiums implied a per share valuation range for Data Dimensions of
$0.55 to $0.91 per share.

   Other Analyses. Updata Capital conducted such other analyses as it deemed
necessary, including: performing a relative contribution analysis based upon
each of Data Dimensions' and Lionbridge's financial profiles and pro forma
equity stake of Data Dimensions and Lionbridge stockholders in the combined
entity; analyzing selected research reports related to industry sectors in
which Data Dimensions and Lionbridge participate; and reviewing the stock price
performance of Data Dimensions, Lionbridge and other relevant publicly traded
companies.

   Pursuant to its engagement letter with Updata Capital, Data Dimensions has
agreed to pay Updata Capital a fee, upon consummation of an acquisition of Data
Dimensions or of any Data Dimensions business unit by any party, of 4% of the
first ten million dollars of consideration paid in any such transaction, 2% of
the next forty million dollars of consideration and 1% of all consideration
above fifty million dollars, with a minimum fee of $400,000. In addition, the
letter provides for payment to Updata Capital of a fairness opinion fee of
$200,000. The engagement letter also provides that Data Dimensions will
reimburse Updata Capital for its reasonable out-of-pocket expenses and will
indemnify Updata Capital and certain related persons against certain
liabilities arising out of its engagement. Updata Capital also received a fee
of $400,000 in connection with the sale of Data Dimensions Information
Services, a subsidiary of Data Dimensions, on December 28, 2000.

Important United States Federal Income Tax Consequences

   The following are the material U.S. federal income tax consequences
generally applicable to U.S. holders of Data Dimensions common stock who,
pursuant to the merger, exchange their shares of Data Dimensions common stock
for Lionbridge common stock. This discussion is based on the Internal Revenue
Code of 1986, as amended, applicable Treasury regulations, administrative
interpretations and court decisions as in effect as of the date of this proxy
statement/prospectus, all of which may change, possibly with retroactive
effect.

   This discussion only addresses shares of Data Dimensions common stock held
as capital assets. It does not address all aspects of U.S. federal income
taxation that may be important to a Data Dimensions stockholder in light of
that stockholder's particular circumstances or to a Data Dimensions stockholder
subject to special rules, such as:

  .  a stockholder who is not a citizen or resident of the U.S.;

  .  a financial institution or insurance company;

  .  a tax-exempt organization;

  .  a dealer or broker in securities;

  .  a stockholder that holds Data Dimensions common stock as part of a
     hedge, appreciated financial position, straddle or conversion
     transaction; or

  .  a stockholder who acquired Data Dimensions common stock pursuant to the
     exercise of options or otherwise as compensation.

   Tax Opinion. Data Dimensions has received an opinion of Garvey, Schubert &
Barer ("tax counsel"), dated as of the date of this proxy statement/prospectus,
that the merger will be treated for U.S. federal income tax purposes as a
reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue
Code and that Lionbridge, its merger subsidiary and Data Dimensions will each
be a party to that reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(b) of the
Internal Revenue Code. Garvey, Schubert & Barer will issue a confirmation
opinion to the same effect at the effective time of the merger.

   The opinion of tax counsel regarding the merger has relied, and the
confirmation opinion regarding the merger as of the effective time of the
merger will rely, on (1) representations and covenants made by Lionbridge and
Data Dimensions, including those contained in certificates of officers of
Lionbridge, its merger subsidiary and Data Dimensions, and (2) specified
assumptions, including an assumption regarding the completion of the merger in
the manner contemplated by the agreement and plan of reorganization. In
addition, the opinion of tax counsel has assumed, and tax counsel's ability to
provide the opinion at the effective time will depend on, the absence of
changes in existing facts or in law between the date of this proxy
statement/prospectus and the effective time of the merger. If any of those
representations, covenants or assumptions is inaccurate, tax counsel may not be
able to provide the required opinion at the effective time or the tax
consequences of the merger could differ from those described in the opinion
that tax counsel has delivered. Tax counsel's opinion neither binds the
Internal Revenue Services ("IRS") nor precludes the IRS or the courts from
adopting a contrary position. Neither Lionbridge nor Data Dimensions intends to
obtain a ruling from the IRS on the tax consequences of the merger.

   U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences to Data Dimensions Stockholders Who
Participate in the Merger. Assuming the merger qualifies as a reorganization
within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code, there are
the following U.S. federal income tax consequences:

  .  A holder of Data Dimensions common stock will not recognize any gain or
     loss upon its exchange of shares of Data Dimensions common stock for
     shares of Lionbridge common stock, except with respect to cash, if any,
     received instead of fractional shares of Lionbridge common stock.

  .  If a holder of Data Dimensions common stock receives cash instead of a
     fractional share of Lionbridge common stock, the holder will be required
     to recognize capital gain or loss (provided that the shares surrendered
     are held as capital assets immediately prior to the merger), measured by
     the difference between the amount of cash received instead of that
     fractional share and the portion of the tax basis of that holder's
     shares of Data Dimensions common stock allocable to that fractional
     share. This capital gain or loss will be long-term capital gain or loss
     if the share of Data Dimensions common stock exchanged for that
     fractional share of Lionbridge common stock was held for more than one
     year at the effective time of the merger.

  .  A holder of Data Dimensions common stock will have a tax basis in the
     Lionbridge common stock received in the merger equal to (1) the tax
     basis of the Data Dimensions common stock surrendered by that holder in
     the merger, less (2) any tax basis of the Data Dimensions common stock
     surrendered that is allocable to any fractional share of Lionbridge
     common stock for which cash is received.

  .  The holding period for shares of Lionbridge common stock received in
     exchange for Data Dimensions common stock in the merger will include the
     holding period for the shares of Data Dimensions common stock
     surrendered in the merger; provided that the Data Dimensions stock so
     surrendered is held as a capital asset at the time of the merger.

  .  No gain or loss will be recognized by Lionbridge, its merger subsidiary
     or Data Dimensions solely as a result of the merger.

   If the IRS were to successfully challenge the "reorganization" status of the
merger, each Data Dimensions stockholder would recognize taxable gain or loss
with respect to the Data Dimensions common stock surrendered, measured by the
difference between (1) the fair market value, as of the time of the merger, of
the Lionbridge common stock received in the merger, and (2) the stockholder's
tax basis in the Data Dimensions

common stock surrendered therefor in the merger. In such event, a stockholder's
aggregate basis in the Lionbridge common stock so received would equal its fair
market value as of the time of the merger and the holding period for such stock
would begin the day after the merger.

   Under the agreement and plan of reorganization, each Data Dimensions
stockholder will receive outright, upon surrender of its shares of Data
Dimensions stock, 0.190884 of a share of Lionbridge common stock for each share
of Data Dimensions common stock surrendered. Data Dimensions stockholders will
be required to attach a statement to their tax returns for the year of the
merger that contains the information listed in Treasury Regulation Section
1.368-3(b). Such statement must include the stockholder's tax basis in the
stockholder's Data Dimensions common stock and a description of the Lionbridge
common stock received therefor. Data Dimensions stockholders are urged to
consult their tax advisors with respect to this statement and any other tax
reporting requirements.

   This discussion of material U.S. federal income tax consequences is not a
complete analysis or description of all potential U.S. federal income tax
consequences of the merger. This discussion does not address tax consequences
that may vary with, or are contingent upon, individual circumstances. In
addition, this discussion does not address any non-income tax or any foreign,
state or local tax consequences of the merger.

   LIONBRIDGE AND DATA DIMENSIONS INTEND THIS DISCUSSION TO PROVIDE ONLY A
SUMMARY OF THE MATERIAL UNITED STATES FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSEQUENCES OF THE
MERGER. LIONBRIDGE AND DATA DIMENSIONS DO NOT INTEND THAT IT BE A COMPLETE
ANALYSIS OR DESCRIPTION OF ALL POTENTIAL FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSEQUENCES OF THE
MERGER. LIONBRIDGE AND DATA DIMENSIONS DO NOT ADDRESS CERTAIN CATEGORIES OF
STOCKHOLDERS, AND LIONBRIDGE AND DATA DIMENSIONS DO NOT ADDRESS STATE, LOCAL OR
FOREIGN TAX CONSEQUENCES. IN ADDITION, AS NOTED ABOVE, LIONBRIDGE AND DATA
DIMENSIONS DO NOT ADDRESS TAX CONSEQUENCES THAT MAY VARY WITH, OR ARE
CONTINGENT UPON, INDIVIDUAL CIRCUMSTANCES. LIONBRIDGE AND DATA DIMENSIONS
STRONGLY URGE YOU TO CONSULT YOUR TAX ADVISOR TO DETERMINE YOUR PARTICULAR
UNITED STATES FEDERAL, STATE, LOCAL OR FOREIGN INCOME OR OTHER TAX CONSEQUENCES
RESULTING FROM THE MERGER, IN LIGHT OF YOUR INDIVIDUAL CIRCUMSTANCES.

Accounting Treatment of the Merger

   Lionbridge intends to account for the merger as a purchase for accounting
and financial reporting purposes, which means that Data Dimensions will be
treated as a separate entity for periods prior to the effective time of the
merger, and thereafter as a wholly owned subsidiary of Lionbridge.

Interests of Executive Officers and Directors of Data Dimensions in the Merger

   When considering the recommendation of Data Dimensions' board of directors,
you should be aware that the directors and executive officers of Data
Dimensions have interests in the merger that are different from the interests
of Data Dimensions' stockholders generally. As a result, these officers and
directors may be more likely to vote to approve and to recommend the merger and
agreement and plan of reorganization than if they did not hold these interests.
These interests include:

  .  Howard H. Hayakawa, an executive officer of Data Dimensions, will become
     an executive of the combined company after the merger.

  .  Each of Peter A. Allen, Laurence C. Leslie and John W. Cramer, executive
     officers of Data Dimensions, is entitled to receive benefits under
     severance agreements or Data Dimensions' severance policy, as the case
     may be, in the event the merger is approved and completed. The benefits
     under the severance arrangements include:

       (i) Cash payments of $350,000 to Mr. Allen and $195,000, in the
    aggregate, to the other executive officers.

       (ii) Continuation of health benefits of twelve months for Mr. Allen
    and six months for Mr. Leslie and Mr. Cramer; and

       (iii) All accrued and unused vacation will be paid to the executive
    officers.

  .  Executive officers and directors of Data Dimensions have options, the
     vesting of which will accelerate upon the giving of notice by Data
     Dimensions to optionees of the merger, which notice shall be given not
     less than 30 days before the effective time of the merger.

  .  Data Dimensions' directors and officers have customary rights to
     indemnification against specified liabilities.

Nasdaq National Market Quotation of Lionbridge Common Stock

   The approval for quotation on the Nasdaq National Market of the shares of
Lionbridge common stock to be issued in the merger is a condition to the
consummation of the merger.

Resale of Lionbridge Common Stock Issued in connection with the Merger

   The shares of Lionbridge common stock to be issued in connection with the
merger will be registered under the Securities Act and will be freely
transferable under the Securities Act, except for shares of Lionbridge common
stock issued to any person who is deemed to be an affiliate of either
Lionbridge or Data Dimensions at the effective time of the merger. Persons who
may be deemed to be affiliates include individuals or entities that control,
are controlled by, or are under common control with either Lionbridge or Data
Dimensions and may include some of the officers, directors, or principal
stockholders of Lionbridge or Data Dimensions. Affiliates may not sell their
shares of Lionbridge common stock acquired in connection with the merger except
pursuant to:

  .  an effective registration statement under the Securities Act covering
     the resale of those shares;

  .  an exemption afforded by Rule 145 under the Securities Act; or

  .  another applicable exemption under the Securities Act.

   Lionbridge's registration statement on Form S-4, of which this proxy
statement/prospectus forms a part, does not cover the resale of shares of
Lionbridge common stock to be received by affiliates in the merger.

           CAUTIONARY STATEMENT CONCERNING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS

   Lionbridge and Data Dimensions believe this document contains "forward-
looking statements" within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation
Reform Act of 1995. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties and
are based on the beliefs and assumptions of management of Lionbridge and Data
Dimensions, based on information currently available to each company's
management. When we use words such as "believes," "expects," "anticipates,"
"intends," "future," "could," "plans," "estimates," "should," "likely" or
similar words or expressions, we are making forward-looking statements.
Forward-looking statements include the information concerning possible or
assumed future results of operations of Lionbridge set forth:

  .  under "Summary," "Selected Unaudited Pro Forma Combined Condensed
     Financial Data of Lionbridge and Data Dimensions," "Risk Factors" "--
     Background of the Merger," "--Lionbridge's Reasons for the Merger," "--
     Recommendation of the Board of Directors of Data Dimensions; Data
     Dimensions' Reasons for the Merger," "--Opinion of Data Dimensions'
     Financial Advisor," "Business" of Lionbridge and Data Dimensions,
     "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results
     of Operations" of Lionbridge and Data Dimensions and "Unaudited Pro
     Forma Combined Condensed Financial Statements of Lionbridge and Data
     Dimensions."

   Forward-looking statements are not guarantees of performance. They involve
risks, uncertainties and assumptions. The future results and stockholder values
of Lionbridge or Data Dimensions may differ materially from those expressed in
the forward-looking statements. Many of the factors that will determine these
results and values are beyond our ability to control or predict. Stockholders
are cautioned not to put undue reliance on any forward-looking statements. For
those statements, we claim the protection of the safe harbor for forward-
looking statements contained in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of
1995.

   For a discussion of some of the factors that may cause actual results to
differ materially from those suggested by the forward-looking statements,
please read carefully the information under "Risk Factors" beginning on page 9.
In addition to the risk factors, you should understand that the following
important factors could affect the future results of Lionbridge and could cause
results to differ materially from those suggested by the forward-looking
statements:

  .  increased competitive pressures, both domestically and internationally,
     which may affect sales of Lionbridge's services and impede Lionbridge's
     ability to maintain its market share and pricing goals;

  .  changes in United States, global or regional economic conditions,
     including uncertainty in the technology market, which may affect sales
     of the combined company's services and increase costs associated with
     providing such services;

  .  changes in United States and global financial and equity markets,
     including significant interest rate fluctuations, which may increase the
     cost of external financing for Lionbridge's operations, and currency
     fluctuations, which may negatively impact Lionbridge's reportable
     income;

  .  changes in laws or regulations, third party relations and approvals,
     decisions of courts, regulators and governmental bodies which may
     adversely affect Lionbridge's business or ability to compete; and

  .  other risks and uncertainties as may be detailed from time to time in
     Lionbridge's public announcements and SEC filings.

   This list of factors that may affect future performance and the accuracy of
forward-looking statements is illustrative, but by no means exhaustive.
Accordingly, all forward-looking statements should be evaluated with the
understanding of their inherent uncertainty.

                    THE AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF REORGANIZATION

   The following is a brief summary of the material provisions of the agreement
and plan of reorganization, as amended, a copy of which is attached as Annex A
to this proxy statement/prospectus and is incorporated by reference into this
summary. The summary is not complete and is qualified in its entirety by
reference to the agreement and plan of reorganization. Lionbridge and Data
Dimensions urge all stockholders of Data Dimensions to read the agreement and
plan of reorganization in its entirety for a more complete description of the
terms and conditions of the merger.

Effect of the Merger

   Following the approval and adoption of the merger and the agreement and plan
of reorganization by the stockholders of Data Dimensions and the satisfaction
or waiver of the other conditions to the merger, a wholly owned subsidiary of
Lionbridge, named "Diamond Acquisition Corp.," will be merged into Data
Dimensions. Data Dimensions will survive the merger as a wholly owned
subsidiary of Lionbridge. If all conditions to the merger are satisfied or
waived, the merger will become effective at the time of the filing by the
surviving corporation of a duly executed certificate of merger with the
Secretary of State of the State of Delaware, or at any later time as Lionbridge
and Data Dimensions shall agree and specify in the certificate of merger. The
agreement and plan of reorganization provides that the certificate of
incorporation of Diamond Acquisition Corp. as in effect immediately prior to
the effective time, will be the certificate of incorporation of the surviving
corporation, except that the name of the surviving corporation will be changed
to "Data Dimensions, Inc." The agreement and plan of reorganization also
provides that the by-laws of Diamond Acquisition Corp. as in effect immediately
prior to the effective time will be the by-laws of the surviving corporation.
The directors of Diamond Acquisition Corp. immediately prior to the completion
of the merger will become the directors of the surviving corporation, to hold
office in accordance with the by-laws of the surviving corporation. Each share
of Diamond Acquisition Corp. common stock issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the merger will be converted into and exchanged for one validly
issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock of the surviving
corporation.

Exchange of Shares

   Treatment of Data Dimensions Common Stock. At the effective time of the
merger, each issued and outstanding share of Data Dimensions common stock other
than shares held by Data Dimensions, Lionbridge or Diamond Acquisition Corp.,
will be converted into the right to receive a number of shares of Lionbridge
common stock equal to the conversion ratio. The conversion ratio is 0.190884.
At the effective time, all shares of Data Dimensions common stock will no
longer be outstanding and will automatically be canceled and retired and will
cease to exist, and each holder of a certificate which immediately prior to the
effective time represented any shares of Data Dimensions common stock will
cease to have any rights as to these shares, except the right to receive shares
of Lionbridge common stock and any cash instead of fractional shares of
Lionbridge common stock.

   Based on the conversion ratio of 0.190884 and the 13,560,972 shares of Data
Dimensions common stock issued and outstanding as of March 8, 2001,
approximately 2,588,570 shares of Lionbridge common stock will be issued to the
holders of Data Dimensions common stock in the merger. The actual number of
shares of Lionbridge common stock issued may differ because the number of
shares of Data Dimensions common stock outstanding at the effective time of the
merger may differ.

   Treatment of Data Dimensions Stock Options and Warrants. Data Dimensions'
stock option plan provides that each issued and outstanding but unvested option
to purchase shares of Data Dimensions common stock under the stock option plan
shall accelerate upon the giving of notice by Data Dimensions to optionees of a
change in control of Data Dimensions (such as the merger), which notice shall
be given not less than 30 days before the effective time of the merger. At the
effective time of the merger, each unexpired and unexercised outstanding option
or warrant to purchase shares of Data Dimensions common stock, whether vested
or unvested, previously granted by Data Dimensions will be assumed by
Lionbridge and converted into options or

warrants, as the case may be, to purchase shares of Lionbridge common stock
upon substantially the same terms and conditions. The number of shares of
Lionbridge common stock subject to the assumed Data Dimensions stock options
and warrants will equal the number of shares of the Data Dimensions common
stock issuable under the original stock options or warrants multiplied by the
conversion ratio. Based on the conversion ratio of 0.190884 and options and
warrants to purchase 2,298,343 shares of Data Dimensions common stock
outstanding as of March 8, 2001, the Data Dimensions options and warrants
assumed by Lionbridge will represent the right, in the aggregate, to purchase
up to approximately 438,717 shares of Lionbridge common stock. Any fractional
shares of Lionbridge common stock resulting from this assumption will be
rounded down to the nearest share. The exercise price per share of Lionbridge
common stock under the assumed Data Dimensions stock options and warrants will
equal the exercise price per share of the Data Dimensions common stock under
the original stock options or warrants divided by the conversion ratio. The
exercise prices will be rounded up to the next highest whole cent.

   Fractional Shares. Lionbridge will not issue any fractional shares of
Lionbridge common stock in the merger. Instead, each holder of shares of Data
Dimensions common stock exchanged in the merger who would otherwise have been
entitled to receive a fraction of a share of Lionbridge common stock will be
entitled to receive cash (without interest) in an amount equal to the product
of the fractional part of Lionbridge common stock multiplied by $5.6688, the
average closing sales price of Lionbridge common stock over the five trading
days ended on the last trading day prior to the date of the agreement and plan
of reorganization.

Exchange of Stock Certificates

   Surrender of Shares of Data Dimensions Stock; Stock Transfer Books. After
the effective time of the merger, Lionbridge will mail a notice and letter of
transmittal to each record holder of certificates representing Data Dimensions
stock advising the holders of the effectiveness of the merger and the
instructions for surrendering the certificates for Lionbridge common stock and
for the payment in lieu of fractional shares. Holders of certificates who
properly surrender their certificates in accordance with the instructions in
the notice will receive certificates representing the number of shares of
Lionbridge common stock, cash in lieu of any fractional shares of Lionbridge
common stock and any dividends or distributions to which they are entitled. The
surrendered certificates will be cancelled.

   No Further Registration or Transfer of Data Dimensions Common Stock. At the
effective time of the merger, the stock transfer books of Data Dimensions will
be closed and there will be no further transfers of shares of Data Dimensions
common stock on the records of Data Dimensions or exercises of any options,
warrants or other rights to acquire Data Dimensions stock for shares of Data
Dimensions capital stock. After the effective time of the merger, the holders
of Data Dimensions stock certificates will cease to have any rights with
respect to the shares of Data Dimensions capital stock except as otherwise
provided for in the agreement and plan of reorganization or by applicable law.

   Dividends and Distributions. No dividends or other distributions declared or
made on or after the closing date of the merger with respect to shares of
Lionbridge common stock will be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered Data
Dimensions certificate with respect to the shares of Lionbridge common stock
that the holder is entitled to receive until the holder surrenders the Data
Dimensions certificate as provided above and provides customary representations
and certifications as are requested in the transmittal form sent to each
holder. Upon surrender of the certificates, Lionbridge will pay to the person
in whose name the Data Dimensions certificates representing the shares of
Lionbridge common stock will be issued, without interest, any dividends or
distributions with respect to the shares of Lionbridge common stock which have
a record date on or after the effective time of the merger and have become
payable between the effective time of the merger and the time of surrender.

   Lost Certificates. If any certificates representing shares of Data
Dimensions stock or instruments representing Data Dimensions options or
warrants are lost, stolen or destroyed, the Data Dimensions

stockholder must provide an appropriate affidavit of that fact. Lionbridge may
require the owner of the lost, stolen or destroyed Data Dimensions certificate
or instrument to deliver a bond as indemnity against any claim that may be made
against Lionbridge with respect to the Data Dimensions certificate or
instrument alleged to have been lost, stolen or destroyed.

   Holders of Data Dimensions common stock should not send in their
certificates until they receive a letter of transmittal from Lionbridge.

     (1) Lionbridge, Data Dimensions and Diamond Acquisition Corp. may
  terminate the agreement and plan of reorganization by mutual written
  consent;

     (2) Lionbridge may terminate the agreement and plan of reorganization if
  it is not in material breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or
  agreement contained in the agreement and plan of reorganization and Data
  Dimensions is in material breach of any representation, warranty, covenant
  or agreement contained in the agreement and plan of reorganization if the
  breach would result in a failure of Data Dimensions to satisfy the closing
  conditions and the breach is not remedied by Data Dimensions within five
  business days of notice of the breach;

  reorganization (i) if it is not in material breach of any representation,

     (4) Either party may terminate the agreement and plan of reorganization
  by giving written notice to the other party if the effective time of the
  merger has not occurred on or before July 31, 2001, except that this right
  to terminate the agreement and plan of reorganization is not available to
  any party whose failure to fulfill any obligation under the agreement and
  plan of reorganization has been a significant cause of, or resulted in, the
  failure of the effective time of the merger to occur by July 31, 2001.

   If either Lionbridge or Data Dimensions terminates the agreement and plan of
reorganization pursuant to any of the reasons above, all obligations of the
parties under the agreement and plan of reorganization shall terminate and
there will be no liability, except for (i) any liability of a party for willful
breaches of the agreement and plan of reorganization on the part of Lionbridge,
Data Dimensions, or Diamond Acquisition Corp. and (ii) the payment of a
termination fee as set forth below.

   In addition, if (a) the agreement and plan of reorganization is terminated
by Data Dimensions pursuant to proviso 3(ii) above or by Lionbridge or Data
Dimensions pursuant to proviso 4 above and (b) Data Dimensions' board of
directors shall have not recommended to its stockholders to vote in favor of
approval of the merger, then Data Dimensions shall pay to Lionbridge a
termination fee of $600,000. Data Dimensions must also pay a $600,000
termination fee to Lionbridge if (x) either Lionbridge or Data Dimensions
terminates the agreement and plan of reorganization pursuant to proviso 4 above
or if Data Dimensions terminates pursuant to proviso 3(ii) above and (y) Data
Dimensions consummates an acquisition with a party other than Lionbridge at any
time on or prior to the nine-month anniversary of the termination of the

terminates the agreement and plan of reorganization pursuant to proviso 3(i)
above, then Lionbridge shall pay a $600,000 termination fee to Data Dimensions.

to the printing of this proxy statement/prospectus.

Amendment and Waiver

   Generally, the boards of directors of Lionbridge and Data Dimensions may
amend the agreement and plan of reorganization at any time prior to the
effective time. However, after the stockholders of Data Dimensions approve the
merger, any amendment will be restricted by the Delaware general corporation
law. Amendments must be in writing and signed by all parties.

                             THE VOTING AGREEMENTS

   The following is a brief summary of the material provisions of the voting
agreements, a copy of the form of which is attached as Annex B to this proxy
statement/prospectus and is incorporated by reference into this summary. The
summary is not complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the
form of the voting agreement.

   In connection with the execution of the agreement and plan of
reorganization, Lionbridge entered into voting agreements with all of the
directors, executive officers, affiliates and 10% stockholders of Data
Dimensions. These stockholders beneficially own 2,571,020 shares of Data
Dimensions common stock representing approximately 18.9% of the outstanding
capital stock of Data Dimensions as of March 8, 2001. Each signing stockholder
has agreed to vote all shares of Data Dimensions common stock held by the
stockholder in favor of approval and adoption of the merger and the agreement
and plan of reorganization and has agreed to grant Lionbridge an irrevocable
proxy to vote the stockholder's shares in favor of approval and adoption of
the merger and the agreement and plan of reorganization. The voting agreements
further require that each signing stockholder will not, nor permit any entity
under the stockholder's control to, deposit any of the stockholder's shares in
a voting trust or subject any of the stockholder's shares to any arrangement
with respect to the voting of the shares inconsistent with the voting
agreement. The signing stockholders also have agreed not to transfer any of
their shares, or make any offer or agreement relating to any transfer of the
shares, at any time prior to the expiration of the voting agreement. The
general effect of the voting agreements is to increase the likelihood that
Data Dimensions stockholder approval will be obtained and possibly discourage
third parties who are interested in acquiring a significant ownership interest
in Data Dimensions. The voting agreements will terminate upon the earliest to
occur of (1) the effective time of the merger, (2) the date of any termination
of the agreement and plan of reorganization in accordance with the terms
thereof or (3) the date on which the Data Dimensions board of directors
withdraws its recommendation to the Data Dimensions stockholders to vote in
favor of adoption of the agreement and plan of reorganization and approval of
the merger.

                          THE STOCK OPTION AGREEMENT

   The following is a brief summary of the material provisions of the stock
option agreement, a copy of which is attached as Annex C to this proxy
statement/prospectus and is incorporated by reference into this summary. The
summary is not complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the
stock option agreement.

   In connection with the execution of the agreement and plan of
reorganization, Data Dimensions entered into a stock option agreement with
Lionbridge as of March 8, 2001. The stock option agreement grants to
Lionbridge the option to purchase the number of shares of Data Dimensions
common stock equal to 19.9% of the shares of Data Dimensions common stock
issued and outstanding as of the date of the consummation of an acquisition
transaction which triggers Lionbridge's right to exercise the option. The
option is exercisable for the one-year period following the consummation of an
acquisition of all or a significant part of Data Dimensions' business, assets
or capital stock, whether by merger, consolidation, other business
combination, purchase of assets, tender or exchange offer or otherwise with a
party other than Lionbridge. The option exercise price is $1.08 per share.

   The option will terminate and no longer be exercisable upon the earliest to
occur of any of the following:

  .  the effective time of the merger;

  .  the termination of the agreement and plan of reorganization (i) by the
     mutual agreement of Lionbridge, Data Dimensions and Diamond Acquisition
     Corp., or (ii) by Data Dimensions as a result of a material breach by
     Lionbridge of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement set
     forth in the agreement and plan of reorganization; or

  .  the nine-month anniversary of any termination of the agreement and plan
     of reorganization, provided that Data Dimensions has not consummated an
     acquisition transaction with a party other than Lionbridge prior to this
     date.

   At any time after the occurrence of an acquisition transaction that triggers
Lionbridge's right to exercise the option, at the request of Lionbridge or any
owner of shares of Data Dimensions common stock issued pursuant to the option,
Data Dimensions will repurchase the option or any shares issued upon exercise
of the option, as the case may be, at a price per share equal to the difference
between the price per share of Data Dimensions common stock paid to the
stockholders of Data Dimensions (as determined in accordance with the terms of
the stock option agreement) pursuant to the acquisition transaction and the
option exercise price. In addition, the stock option agreement grants
registration rights to Lionbridge and/or any other owner of shares of Data
Dimensions common stock issued upon exercise of the option with respect to the
shares of Data Dimensions common stock issued or issuable pursuant to the
option.

functionality and compatibility testing assure that its clients' products work
as intended and interoperate as required, while its logo certification testing
confirms that independent software vendors' applications properly interact with
those of the platform vendor. Thus, its end-to-end service offering allows its
clients to work with a single outsource provider, which results in time and
cost savings benefits to its clients.

   Established Global Presence. Lionbridge operates 20 localization and testing
centers in eleven countries throughout the world. Lionbridge believes its
strong geographic coverage allows it to better serve clients on a local basis,
helping to forge strong, long-term client relationships and service the
widespread offices of its clients, their customers and vendors. In addition to
over 750 consulting and service professionals, Lionbridge maintains a global
network of over 2,500 third-party translators. This global network of
translators provides it with local-country linguistic and cultural expertise in
many languages and cultures and enables it to handle larger, more complex
engagements.

   Industry Expertise. Lionbridge has developed significant globalization
expertise in targeted industries by offering services that accommodate the
various needs of organizations in these industries. Lionbridge currently
organizes its delivery of services into four primary industry groups:
technology, telecommunications, life sciences and financial services.
Lionbridge leverages its expertise in these industries across the entire
company to provide clients the full value of its expertise.

   Lionbridge, through its predecessor and current wholly owned subsidiary,

Recent Developments

   In January 2001, Lionbridge acquired Quality Group Labs, Inc., a provider of
testing services based in Massachusetts, for total initial consideration of
approximately $762,000, comprised of $250,000 of cash and 163,874 shares of
Lionbridge common stock valued at $512,000. The transaction will be accounted
for using the purchase method of accounting. Lionbridge has the right to
repurchase up to 89,386 shares of the common stock issued as part of the
acquisition at a price of $0.01 per share, dependent on future operating
performance of Quality Group Labs, Inc. through December 31, 2001.

Lionbridge Services

   Lionbridge provides a full suite of globalization services to businesses to
improve the quality, consistency, and timeliness of their international product
releases, technical support, training materials, and sales and marketing
information. Its globalization services consist of the following:

   Strategic Consulting Services. Lionbridge provides strategic globalization
consulting services throughout the client's product life cycle which are geared
towards making the client and their globalization activities more successful.
These service include:

  .  Web Globalization Audits. Lionbridge analyzes Web site infrastructure,
     design, and content with respect to issues ranging from cultural
     appropriateness to localization of content;

  .  Authoring and Design. Lionbridge assists clients in writing the copy for
     and the design of product packaging and user manuals, which enables more
     efficient downstream localization activities by controlling initial
     content development;

  .  Content Design. Lionbridge enables clients to properly design their
     content repositories in order to facilitate translation into multiple
     languages as well as multiple delivery options;

  .  Global Identity Consulting. Lionbridge provides analysis and assistance
     on the cultural fit of product naming and identity in a particular
     country; and

  .  ChinaConnect. Lionbridge's ChinaConnect consulting services range from
     content identification through development and deployment of
     multilingual Web sites. Its services generally focus on those China- or
     Taiwan-based clients who are creating their initial Web sites as a means
     to attract customers who may not speak their local languages. Therefore,
     ChinaConnect also has a large linguistic and technical implementation
     component in addition to strategic consulting.

   Linguistic and Technical Implementation Services. Lionbridge provides the
following linguistic and technical implementation services:

  .  Localization. Lionbridge creates foreign language versions of its
     clients' products, content, and software applications, including the
     user interface, on-line help systems, documentation, technical support
     databases, training materials, and sales and marketing information.
     Lionbridge provides its clients with re-engineered, fully tested, and
     culturally adapted multilingual versions of their products and
     applications. Lionbridge uses a combination of internal and external
     translators, as well as translation software, for its localization
     services. Lionbridge has approximately 125 translators and editors who
     are employees and established relationships with a global network of
     over 2,500 third-party, local-country translators, including independent
     agencies and freelance professionals. Lionbridge also uses translation
     memory software to identify previously translated material for re-use.
     Its Rapid Globalization Methodology standardizes processes, defines key
     activities, and specifies

     goals for each localization project enabling it to deliver high quality,
     localized versions of products and related materials across multiple
     languages and cultures in a timely fashion.

  .  Internationalization. Lionbridge provides source code analysis and
     engineering services that enable software and Web application source
     code to be compatible with country-specific operating systems and
     localized software. Internationalization services are particularly
     critical when working with non-Roman languages such as in Asia and the
     Middle East. Internationalization may include re-engineering source code
     through a complex and highly specialized process to support the "double
     byte" character set requirements of the Japanese, Chinese and Korean
     languages, solving display issues for bi-directional languages such as
     Arabic or Hebrew, or making software compliant with the Unicode
     standard, which is a global standard for representing dozens of
     languages.

  .  Multilingual Technical Publishing  Lionbridge localizes user manuals,
     marketing and training materials and other product support information
     using a variety of desktop publishing and graphics software. Using its
     proprietary workflow technology included in the Lionbridge Globalization
     Platform, multiple language versions are simultaneously delivered to its
     clients in formats ready for printing or Internet delivery.

   Comprehensive Testing Services. As products are deployed throughout the
world, localized platforms can add complexity not existing in the originating
version. Lionbridge tests not only hardware and software products, but also
Web sites. Through its VeriTest division and its global network of labs,
Lionbridge provides the following product testing services:

  .  Functionality Testing. Lionbridge provides functionality and stress
     testing of its clients' products. Early in product development cycles,
     Lionbridge can assist software developers with compatibility or
     functional testing, assuring that the product works as intended and
     interoperates as required. In addition, as many of Lionbridge's clients
     across all industries deploy Web sites, there may be uncertainty
     understanding how much volume these Web sites can accommodate.
     Lionbridge's worldwide infrastructure enables it to provide real world
     concurrent testing from multiple locations to test the capabilities of a
     specific site under a number of scenarios.

  .  Multilingual Product Testing. Lionbridge provides localization testing,
     and software, hardware, and telecommunications internationalization
     testing, through its global network of VeriTest labs. Localization
     testing provides an opportunity to uncover errors that may result during
     the localization process before the product is placed into production
     and into the hands of end users. The goal of localization testing is to
     ensure that local language versions of the product perform consistently
     with the source language version. Internationalization testing is
     necessary to ensure that localized products function properly in the
     local hardware and software environment, including local operating
     systems, peripheral devices, and networking and communication standards.

  .  Logo Certification. Lionbridge, under its VeriTest brand, provides logo
     certification programs for many leading software companies, including
     Autodesk, BMC Software, Microsoft and Oracle. These sponsoring companies
     retain Lionbridge to develop and administer test criteria that
     independent software vendors must satisfy before they may display the
     sponsor's logo (such as Microsoft's Certified for Windows 2000) on their
     products. These certification tests confirm that independent software
     vendors' applications properly interact with those of the platform
     vendor. The logo is an indication to consumers of software quality and
     compatibility. Other Lionbridge logo programs include |Built with Object
     ARX (Autodesk), BMC Certified for Patrol, Designed for Microsoft Windows
     NT and Windows 98, and Oracle E-certified Warehouse.

   Multilingual Content Management Services. Lionbridge provides multilingual
content management services which consist of the continuous updating and other
ongoing management of its clients' localized software products and
multilingual Web content. By utilizing its proprietary technology and
integrating its processes and infrastructure with its clients' content
management processes and technology, Lionbridge is able to manage the
localization process in a semi-automated manner for large volumes of content.
Lionbridge's

multilingual content management services range from the localization of
streaming content and rolling software product releases to the continuous
updating of business information and other localized database content. Examples
of client content requiring these types of globalization services include: a
continuously updating on-line support site maintained in multiple languages; a
learning program which is constantly updated to reflect the latest products and
terminology; a marketing product database which is constantly evolving; and an
e-commerce site with rapidly changing products.

   As corporate Web sites become an integrated global resource, Lionbridge's
clients are increasingly using the Internet to deliver products, technical
support, training materials, and sales and marketing information. Its
globalization services help its clients maintain the quality and consistency of
their Web-based products and content in multiple languages and cultures.
Lionbridge's globalization service offerings support its clients' Web-based
initiatives in the following ways:

  .  eRelease. With the emergence of the Internet, its software clients are
     redesigning their products as Web components and applications, then
     releasing them and providing continuous updates over the Internet.
     Lionbridge provides the methodology and workflow systems to support
     continuous release of multilingual products and updates via the Web.

  .  eSupport. Lionbridge offers localization and maintenance of technical
     support Web sites, including frequently asked questions, product
     specifications, white papers, and technical support databases. As its
     clients continuously update this Web-based information, Lionbridge
     automatically updates the multilingual versions as well. Lionbridge has
     also begun to assist its clients in providing local language responses
     to technical support questions through e-mail.

  .  eLearning. Lionbridge's multilingual eLearning services enable its
     clients to provide updated training materials on the Web in multiple
     languages and culturally appropriate formats as they move from
     instructor-led classroom training to Internet distance learning.

  .  eCommerce. Lionbridge localizes Web-deployed products and information
     including sales and marketing materials, analyst reports, and on-line
     retail catalogs. Its services support continuous updates and revisions
     to these materials.

   For more information, see Note 13 of Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements of Lionbridge included in this proxy statement/prospectus for
financial information relating to Lionbridge's operating segments and
geographic areas of operation.

Sales and Marketing

   Substantially all of Lionbridge's revenue has been generated through its
dedicated direct sales force. Lionbridge currently has more than 50 direct
sales professionals based in the United States, Europe and Asia who sell the
full range of Lionbridge globalization services. Its sales approach is highly
consultative and often involves planning for an organization's ongoing
requirements, including future versions of products, and ongoing support,
maintenance, and training, related to both traditional and Web deployment.
There are often several different functional areas within the same organization
that require one or more of its services. Many of its clients do not coordinate
these purchases but buy these services at the department head level. As a
result, its sales professionals may call on several functional departments and
at various management levels within the same client organization.

   Lionbridge's marketing efforts are designed to create brand recognition and
demand for Lionbridge services throughout the world. Marketing programs include
targeted industry and solution-specific advertising campaigns, trade show
participation, speaking engagements, and promotion of customer success stories.
Lionbridge plans to continue to expand its sales and marketing activities.

Clients

   Lionbridge clients are generally Global 2000 and emerging companies in the
technology, telecommunications, life sciences and financial services
industries. During the year ended December 31, 2000, Lionbridge had provided
services to more than 500 clients worldwide. The following companies are
representative Lionbridge clients, each of whom had purchased more than
$1,000,000 in services from it in the year ended December 31, 2000:

      3 Com                     Informix                          Page Factory
      Cisco Systems             Intel                             Parametric Technology
      Cognos                    Microsoft                         Rational Software
      Hewlett Packard           Nortel Networks                   SAP
      Hyperion                  Novell                             Schneider Automation
      IBM

   In 2000, Lionbridge's largest client accounted for approximately 9% of total
revenue. In 2000, 1999 and 1998, its five largest clients accounted for
approximately 33%, 29% and 32%, respectively, of revenue.

Competition

   Lionbridge provides a broad range of globalization and multilingual Internet
service offerings to its clients. The market for its services is highly
fragmented, and it has many competitors. Lionbridge's current competitors
include the following:

  .  Localization or translation services providers such as Berlitz
     International, Bowne & Co., SDL Limited and regional vendors of
     translation services specializing in specific languages in particular
     geographic areas. More recently, companies which provide tool subsets or
     specific services have entered the market, including eTranslate, Idiom,
     Uniscape, and others;

  .  Independent testing labs providing testing and logo certification
     services such as National Software Testing Laboratories (a division of
     CMP Media), and Keylabs (a subsidiary of Exodus Communications); and

  .  Internal localization departments of Global 2000 and large emerging
     companies.

   Lionbridge may also face competition from a number of other companies in the
future, including some companies that currently seek localization services from
it. As businesses shift from telephonic support centers to Web-based support,
technical support call centers and others that currently provide traditional
outsourcing services may decide to provide comparable globalization services
over the Internet. Other potential entrants into Lionbridge's market include
Web consulting companies who are being asked by their customers to assist them
with international Web deployments. Currently, these companies are often
requesting localization assistance from Lionbridge. Over time, however, they
may determine to expand into localization to directly serve their customers'
requirements. Additionally, as hosting companies expand internationally and
require localization of the content they host, these companies may expand to
provide localization services themselves. As content management providers are
brought international by their customers, they will be required to assist their
customers with maintaining a multilingual database. While today they are often
working with us to assist in meeting their customers' needs, it is possible
that over time they will expand into offering competitive services.

   There are relatively few barriers preventing companies from competing with
Lionbridge. Its technology does not preclude or inhibit others from entering
its market. As a result, new market entrants pose a threat to its business.
While Lionbridge presently uses translation memory software licensed from third
parties in its localization process, and to a lesser extent machine translation
software also licensed from third parties, these technologies may improve and
become sophisticated enough to compete with its localization service offering.

   Lionbridge believes the principal competitive factors in providing its
services include project management expertise, quality and speed of service
delivery, vertical industry expertise, the ability to provide clients end-to-
end globalization solutions, expertise and presence in certain geographic
areas, corporate reputation, and expertise in Internet-related services.
Lionbridge believes it has competed favorably with respect to these factors and
has developed a strong reputation in its industry. However, it cannot assure
you that it will be able to do so in the future.

Intellectual Property Rights

   Lionbridge's success is dependent, in part, upon its proprietary Rapid
Globalization Methodology, its Lionbridge Globalization Platform connectivity,
workflow, language automation, and portal technologies, and other intellectual
property rights. Lionbridge has patents or patent applications pending relating
to its language automation translation memory engine. Lionbridge relies on a
combination of trade secret, nondisclosure and other contractual agreements,
and copyright and trademark laws to protect its intellectual property rights.
Existing trade secret and copyright laws afford it only limited protection.
Lionbridge enters into confidentiality agreements with its employees, require
that its outside consultants and generally its clients enter into these
agreements, and limits access to and distribution of its proprietary
information. Lionbridge cannot assure you that these arrangements will be
adequate to deter misappropriation of its proprietary information or that it
will be able to detect unauthorized use and take appropriate steps to enforce
its intellectual property rights.

Human Resources

   As of December 31, 2000, Lionbridge had 1,062 employees. Of these, 750 were
consulting and service delivery professionals and 312 were management and
administrative personnel performing marketing, sales, operations, process and
technology, research and development, finance, accounting, and administrative
functions.

   Lionbridge has been successful in hiring individuals with leading-edge
technical skills and project management experience. In addition, Lionbridge is
committed to employee training and retention. Lionbridge has a dedicated
knowledge management team that initiates and oversees the training and
development of Lionbridge consulting and service delivery professionals. Key
organizational development initiatives include ongoing technical and project
management classes as well as career path management and guidance. Lionbridge
plans to continue to invest in attracting qualified employees.

   Most employees are eligible to participate in its stock option program,
under which it makes annual grants in varying amounts to its employees based
upon their position and individual contribution to the company. Additionally,
substantially all of its employees are eligible to participate in its employee
stock purchase program.

   Lionbridge's employees in Paris, France are represented by a labor union,
and it has works councils in The Netherlands and Germany. Lionbridge has never
experienced a work stoppage. Lionbridge believes that its employee relations
are good.

Properties

   Lionbridge maintains offices in the United States, Canada, Brazil, Ireland,
France, Germany, The Netherlands, China, Japan, Taiwan and South Korea.
Lionbridge maintains sales offices in Charlotte, North Carolina and the
metropolitan areas of Albuquerque, Chicago, Seattle, Houston, Los Angeles, San
Francisco and New York in the United States; Dublin, Ireland; Paris, France;

   Lionbridge's headquarters and principal administrative, finance, legal, and
marketing operations are located in leased office space in Waltham,
Massachusetts. Lionbridge's lease is for a term of 3 years and expires on

August 1, 2002. Lionbridge maintains a facility in metropolitan Dublin, Ireland
and leases three floors under three separate leases expiring between September
14, 2025 and March 1, 2026. Lionbridge also maintains an operations center in
Framingham, Massachusetts under a lease with a 6-year term that expires in
February 2002. Lionbridge expects that it will need additional space as its
business expands and believe that it will be able to obtain additional space as
needed on commercially reasonable terms.

Overview

   Lionbridge provides globalization services to Global 2000 and emerging
companies. Founded in 1996, Lionbridge has clients in industries such as
technology, telecommunications, life sciences, and financial services.
Lionbridge services include strategic consulting, linguistic and technical
implementation, product testing, and multilingual content management.
Lionbridge manages some of its services under the VeriTest brand for functional
and logo certification testing, the Harvard Translations brand for specialty
translation and print/Web publishing services for the financial services and
life sciences industries, and the ChinaConnect brand for Web integration
services applicable to the Chinese-speaking market.

   Lionbridge's revenue is derived from project-by-project fees and, to a
lesser extent, long-term service agreements. Projects are generally billed on a
time and expense basis, and long-term service agreements are generally billed
on the basis of minimum volume commitments. Revenue is recognized using the
percentage-of-completion method of accounting, based on all costs incurred to
date as a percentage of management's estimate of total costs of individual
projects. The agreements entered into in connection with projects are generally
terminable by clients upon 30 days' prior written notice. If a client
terminates an agreement, it is required to pay Lionbridge for time and expenses
incurred through the termination date. If clients terminate existing projects
or if Lionbridge is unable to enter into new engagements, its financial
condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.

   Lionbridge has experienced operating losses, as well as net losses, for each
year of its operations as an independent company and, as of December 31, 2000,
had an accumulated deficit of $79.3 million.

Acquisitions

   Lionbridge has grown its business through a combination of acquisitions and
organic growth. Such acquisitions through December 31, 2000 have resulted in
the cumulative recognition of approximately $31.8 million of goodwill and other
intangible assets on its balance sheet, which are generally being amortized
over five years.

   In May 2000, Lionbridge acquired Harvard Translations, Inc., a company based
in Massachusetts, by means of a merger. Upon the effective date of the merger,
each outstanding share of Harvard Translations common stock was converted into
the right to receive 3.8864 shares of Lionbridge common stock. In addition,
long-term debt of Harvard Translations payable to its former sole stockholder
in the amount of approximately $203,000 and all accrued interest thereon was
paid in full by the issuance of 13,820 shares of Lionbridge common stock. As a
result of the merger, Lionbridge issued an aggregate of 285,865 shares of
Lionbridge common stock. Upon the completion of the acquisition, all
outstanding options to purchase common stock of

Harvard Translations were assumed by Lionbridge and converted into options to
purchase common stock of Lionbridge under similar terms. The transaction was
accounted for using the pooling-of-interests method of accounting.

   In May 2000, Lionbridge acquired INT'L.com, Inc., a company based in
Massachusetts, by means of a merger. Upon the effective date of the merger, (i)
each outstanding share of INT'L.com Series A common stock, Series B common
stock, Series A preferred stock and Series B preferred stock was converted into
the right to receive 0.7567 shares of Lionbridge common stock, (ii) each
outstanding share of INT'L.com Series C preferred stock was converted into the
right to receive 5.4590 shares of Lionbridge common stock, (iii) each
outstanding share of INT'L.com Series D preferred stock was converted into the

in full and cancelled in exchange for 109,158 shares of Lionbridge common
stock, and (v) the $5.0 million of INT'L.com subordinated debt and all accrued
interest thereon was paid in full and cancelled in exchange for 258,360 shares

Lionbridge under similar terms. The transaction was accounted for using the
pooling-of-interests method of accounting.

   The financial information presented below reflects the combined financial
position, operating results and cash flows of Lionbridge, Harvard Translations
and INT'L.com and their subsidiaries as if they had been combined for all
periods presented.

   In 1996, Lionbridge acquired the localization businesses of Stream
International in Ireland, The Netherlands, and France. Lionbridge acquired
these businesses on December 23, 1996 for $11.3 million in cash and the
assumption of $100,000 of liabilities. Lionbridge's acquisition of the
businesses was recorded as though the purchase had occurred on December 31,
1996, as the results of operations and changes in financial position between
the actual date of the purchase and this date were immaterial. The acquisition
was accounted for using the purchase method of accounting. In connection with
this acquisition, Lionbridge recorded $9.2 million of goodwill, which is being
amortized over five years. Additionally, during 1997, Lionbridge renegotiated
an earlier agreement with Stream International and purchased assets from three
subsidiaries of Stream International which represented the localization
businesses of Stream International in Japan, China, South Korea and Taiwan.
Lionbridge paid approximately $100,000 in cash and assumed liabilities of
$317,000 in exchange for these assets.

   In June 1998, Lionbridge entered into an agreement with Stream International
settling outstanding intercompany balances as well as claims that it had made
that Stream International had breached some of the representations, warranties
and covenants that it had made in connection with its acquisition of the
European businesses. Under the terms of the settlement agreement, Lionbridge's
purchase price for the European business was reduced by $531,000.

full in May 2000.

the purchase method of accounting. In connection with this acquisition, $7.9
million of goodwill was recorded, which is being amortized over five years.

   At December 31, 1998, Lionbridge's wholly owned subsidiary, INT'L.com, had a
32.8% equity investment in Motus!, a French-based provider of localization and
translation services. This investment was accounted for using the equity
method, under which Lionbridge recorded its proportionate share of the (income)
loss of Motus! as other (income) expense, net. On September 30, 1999, INT'L.com
acquired the remaining shares of common stock of Motus! for $124,000 in cash
and options to purchase 4,540 shares of common stock of INT'L.com valued at
$20,000. The transaction was accounted for using the purchase method of
accounting. Goodwill of $217,000 was recorded in connection with this
acquisition, which is being amortized over five years.

   In January 2000, Lionbridge acquired certain assets and operations of the
language services operation of Nortel Networks Corporation ("Nortel") in
Montreal and Ottawa, Canada; Beijing, China; Sao Paulo, Brazil; Sunrise,
Florida; and Bogota, Colombia for total initial consideration of $2.5 million
in cash. In connection with the acquisition, Nortel awarded a preferred vendor
designation to Lionbridge as part of a three-year services agreement. The
purchase agreement provides for certain contingent payments to be made by
Lionbridge during the first three years of the services agreement, dependent on
the level of revenues generated under the services agreement during those
periods. No such contingent payments are due for the first year of the services
agreement. Lionbridge recorded $323,000 of goodwill related to this
acquisition, not including any

additional amounts that may be paid in the future, which is being amortized
over five years. The purchase was accounted for using the purchase method of
accounting.

   Lionbridge believes its acquisitions contributed to its growth by rapidly
expanding its employee base, geographic coverage, client base, industry
expertise, and technical skills. Lionbridge anticipates that a material portion
of its future growth will be accomplished by acquiring existing businesses. The
success of this plan depends upon, among other things, its ability to integrate
acquired personnel, operations, products, and technologies into its
organization effectively; to retain and motivate key personnel of acquired
businesses; and to retain customers of acquired firms. Lionbridge cannot
guarantee that it will be able to identify suitable acquisition opportunities,
obtain any necessary financing on acceptable terms to finance any acquisitions,
consummate any acquisitions, or successfully integrate acquired personnel and
operations.

Non-Cash Charges

 Deferred Compensation

   Lionbridge recorded deferred compensation of approximately $3.8 million in
1999, representing the difference between the exercise price of stock options
granted to employees and the fair market value for accounting purposes of the
underlying common stock at the date of the grant. The deferred compensation is
being amortized over the four-year vesting period of the applicable options. Of
the total deferred compensation amount, $1.5 million had been amortized and
$584,000 had been reversed due to forfeitures of the underlying options at
December 31, 2000. The amortization of deferred compensation is recorded as an
operating expense and totaled $799,000 and $730,000 for the years ended
December 31, 2000 and 1999, respectively. Lionbridge currently expects to
amortize the following remaining amounts of deferred compensation as of
December 31, 2000 in the fiscal periods ending:

      December 31, 2001................................................ $756,000
      December 31, 2002................................................ $756,000
      December 31, 2003................................................ $178,000

 Original Issue Discount on Debt

   Interest expense for the years ended December 31, 2000 and 1999 includes
approximately $212,000 and $42,000, respectively, for the accretion of the
original issue discount on $2.0 million of convertible promissory notes issued
in August 1999 by Lionbridge's wholly owned subsidiary, INT'L.com. This
discount represents the $254,000 value attributable to warrants to purchase
56,753 shares of common stock, at an exercise price of $1.45 per share, granted
in connection with these notes. These warrants were fully exercised in May 2000
in connection with its merger with INT'L.com.

   Interest expense for the year ended December 31, 1999 includes approximately
$6.0 million for the accretion of the original issue discount on $12.0 million
of subordinated notes issued in the first quarter of 1999. This discount
represents the $6.0 million value attributable to detachable warrants to
purchase 1,533,260 shares of common stock, at an exercise price of $0.015 per
share, granted in connection with this debt financing. As Lionbridge was
previously required to repay the subordinated notes in full upon the closing of
its initial public offering, it recorded the expense of this discount on a
straight-line basis over a six-month period from date of debt issuance to the
date by which it expected the initial public offering to occur. Pursuant to an
amendment of the debt agreements effective August 19, 1999, Lionbridge was
required to redeem only $6.0 million of the subordinated notes upon the closing
of its initial public offering of securities on August 25, 1999.

Year Ended December 31, 2000 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 1999

   Revenue. In 2000, revenue increased 29.7% to $115.1 million from $88.8
million in 1999. This increase results from both an increase in the number of
customers as well as an increase in project size during 2000 as compared to
1999. Additionally, results for 2000 reflected revenue derived from the
operations acquired from Nortel in January 2000 which accounted for $6.4
million of the increase as well as the operations of ILE which were only
included in 1999 for nine months.

   Cost of Revenue. Cost of revenue consists primarily of expenses incurred for
translation services provided by third parties as well as salaries and
associated employee benefits for personnel related to client projects. As a
percentage of revenue, cost of revenue was 63.2% in 2000, a decrease of 7.4%
from the 70.6% level of 1999. These decreases are primarily attributable to
decreased outsourcing costs as INT'L.com adopted the Lionbridge outsourcing
pricing structure in the second half of 2000 as well as a reduction in the
internal cost of sales due to the consolidation of certain offices in 2000.

   Sales and Marketing. Sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of
salaries, commissions and associated employee benefits, travel expenses of
sales and marketing personnel, and promotional expenses. Sales and marketing
costs increased 12.3% to $11.4 million in 2000 from $10.1 million in 1999. This
increase was primarily due to expenses associated with the hiring of seven
additional direct sales personnel in 2000. As a percentage of revenue, sales
and marketing expenses decreased to 9.9% from 11.4% during 2000 as a result of
the rate of revenue growth during the year exceeding the corresponding rate of
increase in sales and marketing expense. Sales and marketing expenses are
expected to continue to increase in absolute dollars as Lionbridge continues to
expand its marketing programs.

   General and Administrative.  General and administrative expenses consist of
salaries of the management, purchasing, process and technology, finance and
administrative groups, and associated employee benefits; facilities costs,
including related depreciation and amortization; information systems costs;
professional fees; travel; and all other site and corporate costs. General and
administrative costs increased 13.4% to $33.1 million in 2000 from $29.2
million in 1999, partially as a result of the acquisition of the Nortel
operations in January 2000 and the full-year impact of the acquisition of ILE
in the second quarter of 1999. Also contributing to the increase are higher
depreciation expense, the full-year impact of expenses related to being a
publicly traded company and costs associated with an increased number of
employees. As a percentage of revenue, general and administrative expenses were
28.8% in 2000 compared to 33.0% in 1999.

   Research and Development. Research and development expenses relate to
Foreign Desk(R) and LionTrack(R), Lionbridge's proprietary translation memory
and internal workflow systems which are components of the Lionbridge
Globalization Platform, and include salaries and associated employee benefits,
equipment depreciation and third-party contractor expenses. Research and
development expense increased 13.6% to $2.5 million in 2000 from $2.2 million
in 1999. This increase reflects the full-year impact of LionTrack development
efforts which commenced during the first quarter of 1999.

   Merger, Restructuring and Other Charges. Merger costs for the year ended
December 31, 2000 of $2.5 million consist of fees for investment banking, legal
and accounting services and other direct costs incurred in connection with
Lionbridge's mergers with Harvard Translations and INT'L.com.

   Restructuring charges of $915,000 recorded in the year ended December 31,
2000 relate to (i) the costs of closing facilities in the United States, France
and The Netherlands as a result of the merger with INT'L.com, consisting
primarily of accruals for lease payments on vacant office space, and (ii) costs
associated with workforce reductions in Canada, the United States and France,
consisting of six technical staff and three administrative staff. All employees
had been informed of their termination and related benefits in the period that
the charge was recorded. The restructuring charges are presented net of a
$162,000 reversal of charge recorded in the second quarter of 2000 due to
subsequent events which have reduced the potential loss on vacant office space.
At the time of the charges, Lionbridge did not anticipate any significant net
impact on operating results from these restructuring actions.

   Impairment charges for long-lived assets of $886,000 were recorded in 2000
and consist primarily of the write-off of previously capitalized software
licenses that were abandoned as a result of Lionbridge's merger with INT'L.com.
At December 31, 2000 accruals totaling $394,000 related to restructuring
charges remained on the consolidated balance sheet in other accrued expenses;
no accruals remained for merger costs.

   Restructuring charges of $1.2 million for the year ended December 31, 1999
consisted of restructuring charges related to workforce reductions in
INT'L.com's United States operating sites, consisting of 36 technical staff, 14
administrative staff and four sales staff.

   Amortization of Acquisition-related Intangible Assets. Amortization of
acquisition-related intangible assets consists of amortization of goodwill and
other intangible assets resulting from acquired businesses. Amortization
increased 6.4% to $6.5 million in 2000 from $6.1 million in 1999. This increase
is primarily attributable to the amortization of goodwill and other intangible
assets recognized on the acquisition of the Nortel language services operations
in 2000 as well as the full-year impact of ILE which was only acquired in the
second quarter of 1999.

   Interest Expense. Interest expense represents interest paid or payable on
debt and the accretion of original issue discount on subordinated notes with
detachable warrants. Interest expense decreased to $2.7 million in 2000 from
$8.4 million in 1999. This decrease was principally due to a decrease in the
accretion of the original issue discount on notes issued in 1999 to $212,000
from $6.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2000 and 1999, respectively.

   Other (Income) Expense, Net. Other (income) expense, net consists primarily
of foreign currency translation gains or losses arising from exchange rate
fluctuations on transactions denominated in currencies other than the local
currencies of the countries in which the transactions are recorded. As a
percentage of revenue, other (income) expense, net, increased to 0.6% from 0.4%
for the years ended December 31, 2000 and 1999, respectively. Other (income)
expense, net increased 103.4% to $714,000 in 2000 from $351,000 in 1999.

   Provision for Income Taxes. The provision for income taxes for the years
ended December 31, 2000 and 1999 represents taxes generated in foreign
jurisdictions. Of the provision amounts booked for 2000 and 1999, $143,000 and
$519,000, respectively, represent noncash expenses resulting from utilizations
of net operating loss carryforwards. The benefit from Lionbridge's utilization
of net operating loss carryforwards in certain European countries during these
periods was recorded as a reduction of goodwill, rather than a tax provision
benefit, since the deferred tax assets associated with these carryforwards had
been fully reserved at the time it acquired Stream's localization businesses.
Lionbridge recorded no tax benefit for losses generated in other jurisdictions
during these periods due to the uncertainty of realizing any benefit.

Year Ended December 31, 1999 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 1998

   Revenue. In 1999, revenue increased 48.5% to $88.8 million from $59.8
million in 1998. This increase results from both an increase in number of
clients as well as an increase in project size. Additionally, the 1999 results
reflect the impact of the VeriTest and ILE acquisitions, which accounted for
approximately $5.7 million and $13.0 million of revenue in 1999, respectively.

   Cost of Revenue. As a percentage of revenue, cost of revenue was 70.6% in
1999, compared to the 1998 level of 66.7%, primarily due to the increased
compensation and other costs associated with the increase in the employee base
as a result of acquisitions completed during the year. The fixed cost of
revenue as a percentage of revenue was impacted in fiscal 1999 compared to
fiscal 1998 by the acquisition in January 1999 of VeriTest, which had a higher
ratio of fixed costs to revenue.

   Sales and Marketing. Sales and marketing costs increased 100.7% to $10.1
million in 1999 from $5.1 million in 1998. This increase was primarily due to
expenses associated with the continued hiring of additional direct sales
personnel in fiscal 1999, as well as expanded marketing activities including
advertising and public relations initiatives. As a percentage of revenue, sales
and marketing expenses increased to 11.4% in 1999 from 8.5% during 1998.

   General and Administrative. General and administrative costs increased 78.3%
to $29.2 million in 1999 from $16.4 million in 1998. The increase was primarily
due to the full year impact of 1998 acquisitions, partial-year impact of the
1999 acquisitions and integration expenses of these acquisitions as well as
increased headcount in management and support functions. As a percentage of
revenue, general and administrative expenses were 32.9% in 1999 compared to
27.4% in 1998.

   Research and Development. Research and development expenses totaled $2.2
million for the year ended December 31, 1999, an approximately $2.0 million
increase from the year ended December 31, 1998, when research and development
efforts on its proprietary technology first commenced.

   Amortization of Acquisition-related Intangible Assets. Amortization
increased 150.0% to $6.1 million in 1999 from $2.4 million in 1998. This
increase is primarily attributable to the amortization of goodwill and other
intangible assets from the acquisitions of VeriTest and International Language
Engineering in 1999 as well as the full-year effect of 1998 acquisitions.

   Merger, Restructuring and Other Charges. Merger, restructuring and other
charges of $1.2 million for the year ended December 31, 1999 consisted of
restructuring charges related to workforce reductions in INT'L.com's United
States operating sites, consisting of 36 technical staff, 14 administrative
staff and four

sales staff. Merger, restructuring and other charges of $501,000 for the year
ended December 31, 1998 consisted of restructuring charges related to
reductions in Lionbridge's workforce in France, where it reduced its technical
staff by five employees as a result of a decrease in resources required to
fulfill work orders under a specific customer contract. For the actions taken
in each year, all employees had been informed of their termination and related
benefits in the period that the corresponding charge was recorded. At the time
of the charges, Lionbridge did not anticipate any significant net impact on
operating results from these restructuring actions.

   Acquired In-Process Research and Development. Acquired in-process research
and development expense of $300,000 in 1999 represents a portion of the
International Language Engineering acquisition purchase price which was
allocated to projects that had no alternative future use and had not yet
reached technological feasibility, and therefore was charged to operations at
the acquisition date.

   Interest Expense. Interest expense increased 924.3% to $8.4 million in 1999
from $816,000 in 1998. The increase is principally due to the accretion of $6.0
million of original issue discount on subordinated notes issued in 1999 and to
increased interest as a result of greater borrowings through notes issued and
its commercial credit facility.

   Provision for (Benefit from) Income Taxes. The provision for income taxes
for the years ended December 31, 1999 and 1998 represents taxes generated in
foreign jurisdictions, partially offset in 1998 by a tax benefit of $565,000
resulting from losses of its wholly owned subsidiary, INT'L.com, being carried
back to prior profitable periods. The benefit from Lionbridge's utilization of
net operating loss carryforwards in Europe during these periods was recorded as
a reduction of goodwill, rather than a tax provision benefit, since the
deferred tax assets associated with these carryforwards had been fully reserved
at the time it acquired Stream International's localization businesses.
Lionbridge recorded no tax benefit for losses generated in other jurisdictions
during these periods due to the uncertainty of realizing any benefit.

Quarterly Results of Operations

   The following tables set forth unaudited consolidated quarterly financial
data for the periods indicated. Lionbridge derived this data from its unaudited
consolidated financial statements, and, in the opinion of management, they have
been prepared on the same basis as its audited consolidated financial
statements for the years ended December 31, 2000 and 1999, and include all
adjustments, which consist only of normal recurring adjustments, necessary to
present fairly the financial results for the periods. Certain quarterly amounts
have been reclassified to conform with current year presentation. The operating
results for any quarter are not necessarily indicative of results for any
future period.

   Lionbridge has experienced quarter-to-quarter variability in its revenue and
gross profit. This variability is due to fluctuations in its clients' release
cycles, the length of its sales cycle, rapid growth, acquisitions, the emerging
nature of the markets in which it competes, global economic conditions and
other factors outside its control. Lionbridge believes that quarter-to-quarter
comparisons of results of operations are not necessarily meaningful. You should
not rely on these comparisons as a measure of future performance.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

   Since inception, Lionbridge has relied upon sales of equity securities and
borrowings to fund operations. On August 25, 1999, Lionbridge completed its
initial public offering of 3,500,000 shares of common stock. After deducting
expenses, Lionbridge received approximately $31.8 million in cash proceeds from
this transaction. In June 2000, Lionbridge issued 1,500,000 shares of common
stock at $8.50 per share in a private placement for total consideration before
expenses of approximately $12.8 million.

   Net cash used in operations was $8.6 million in 2000, $10.1 million in 1999,
and $2.7 million in 1998. Cash used in these periods was primarily to fund the
net losses of $20.3 million, $33.2 million and $5.2 million

incurred during these years, respectively, offset in part by depreciation,
amortization and other non-cash expenses, and changes in operating assets and
liabilities. Changes in operating assets and liabilities were largely the
result of the growth of Lionbridge's business operations during these periods.
Lionbridge has not experienced any significant trends in accounts receivable
other than changes relative to increases in sales. Fluctuations in accounts
receivable from period to period relative to changes in sales are a result of
the timing of customer invoicing and receipt of payments from customers.

   Net cash used in investing activities was $6.0 million in 2000, $5.6 million
in 1999, and $7.6 million in 1998. Investing activities for these periods were
primarily purchases of equipment and the acquisitions of JLS, the localization
services division of Lucent Technologies, S&D, and DLC in 1998, VeriTest, ILE,
and Motus! in 1999, and certain assets of the language services operation of
Nortel in 2000.

   Net cash provided by financing activities was $19.0 million in 2000, $27.2
million in 1999, and $10.1 million in 1998. The primary financing activities
were the completion of Lionbridge's initial public offering in 1999 and the
private placement of common stock in 2000, with additional resources being
provided by borrowings against its bank lines of credit in each year as well as
the issuance of the subordinated debt and convertible promissory notes in 1999
and 2000.

   As of December 31, 2000, Lionbridge had $10.3 million outstanding under two
commercial credit facilities with a bank that allow Lionbridge to borrow up to
$13.0 million, expiring in January and February 2001. Both credit facilities
were renewed in January 2001 with a maturity date of April 20, 2001. The bank
has indicated in a letter to Lionbridge its intention to renew the credit
facilities through January 2002. The facilities require Lionbridge to maintain
certain financial covenants and restrict the payment of dividends. The
facilities bear interest at rates ranging from prime plus 1.0% to prime plus
2.00% (9.5% to 10.5% at December 31, 2000) and are collateralized by worldwide
accounts receivable and work in process.

   In the first quarter of 1999, Lionbridge entered into subordinated loan
agreements with Morgan Stanley Venture Capital Fund II Annex, L.P. and Morgan
Stanley Venture Investors Annex, L.P., existing stockholders of Lionbridge, and
Capital Resource Lenders III, L.P. Under the terms of the agreements,
Lionbridge issued $12.0 million of subordinated notes with detachable warrants
to purchase 1,533,260 shares of its common stock at an exercise price of $0.015
per share. The agreements require Lionbridge to comply with several operating
and financial covenants, including a prohibition on the payment of dividends to
its stockholders. In connection with its initial public offering, Lionbridge
repaid $6.0 million of the subordinated notes and Capital Resource Lenders and
the Morgan Stanley-sponsored limited partnerships agreed to defer the repayment
of the remaining $6.0 million of the subordinated notes that would otherwise
have been due upon the completion of its initial public offering. A subsequent
amendment of the debt agreements in March 2001 extended the maturity date of
the notes to the earlier of January 31, 2002 or an underwritten public offering
by Lionbridge with aggregate proceeds of at least $10,000,000. In the event of
a qualifying underwritten public offering, acquisition or merger or other
change of control of Lionbridge, 50% of the then outstanding notes and accrued
interest are payable, with the remaining amount maturing on January 31, 2002.

   In the second quarter of 1999, Lionbridge's wholly owned subsidiary,
INT'L.com, assumed ILE's obligation under a promissory note to a former
stockholder in the amount of $3.3 million as part of its acquisition of ILE.
The promissory note accrues interest at 8.5% per year and matures June 27,
2002. The promissory note is subordinate to all indebtedness owed by INT'L.com
to any bank, pension fund, insurance fund or other financial institution.

   As of December 31, 2000, Lionbridge's other significant financial
commitments consisted of $4.3 million of notes payable, of which $750,000
accrued interest at 8.0% per annum and matured and were paid in January 2001
and of which $3.5 million accrue interest at 6.0% per annum, increasing by 1.0%
per annum and mature in January 2005. Lionbridge also has obligations of
$848,000 under an equipment line of credit and obligations under operating and
capital leases.

   Lionbridge has an agreement with the Irish Industrial Development Agency
regarding financial grants to its Irish subsidiary from this agency. Under the
agreement, the Irish subsidiary may not pay dividends or otherwise distribute
its cash, including any distributions to Lionbridge. In addition, Lionbridge's
European subsidiaries, including its Irish subsidiary, are restricted from
paying dividends to it under the terms of its commercial credit facility with
Silicon Valley Bank. These restrictions have not had a material impact on
Lionbridge or any of its subsidiaries and it does not expect that these
restrictions will have a material impact in the future.

   As of December 31, 2000, Lionbridge had cash and cash equivalents of $16.7
million and an additional $1.5 million available for borrowing under the bank
lines of credit. Its future financing requirements will depend upon a number of
factors, including Lionbridge's operating performance and increases in
operating expenses associated with growth in its business. Lionbridge
anticipates that its present cash position and available financing should
provide adequate cash to fund its currently anticipated cash needs through at
least the next 12 months. Lionbridge cannot assure you that additional
financing, if needed, will be available to Lionbridge at terms acceptable to
it, if at all.

Conversion to the Euro

   On January 1, 1999, 11 European countries began using the Euro as their
single currency, while still continuing to use their own notes and coins for
cash transactions. Banknotes and coins denominated in Euros are expected to be
in circulation by 2002, at which time local notes and coins will cease to be
legal tender. Lionbridge conducts a significant amount of business in these
countries. The introduction of the Euro has not resulted in any material
adverse impact upon the results of its operations, although Lionbridge
continues to monitor the effects of the conversion. Any significant
fluctuations in the value of the Euro could adversely impact the results of its
operations.

Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements

   In June 1998, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards ("SFAS") No. 133, "Accounting for
Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities." SFAS No. 133 was amended on
July 7, 1999 by the issuance of SFAS No. 137, "Accounting for Derivative
Instruments and Hedging Activities--Deferral of the Effective Date of FASB
Statement No. 133--an amendment of FASB Statement No. 133." SFAS No. 137 defers
the implementation of SFAS No. 133 by one year. SFAS No. 133, as amended, is
effective for fiscal quarters beginning after December 31, 2000 for Lionbridge,
and Lionbridge does not expect its adoption to have a material impact on its
financial position or results of operations.

   In September 2000, the FASB issued SFAS No. 140, "Accounting for Transfers
and Servicing of Financial assets and Extinguishments of Liabilities--a
replacement of FASB Statement No. 125." SFAS No. 140 revises the standards for
accounting for securitizations and other transfers of financial assets and
collateral and requires certain disclosures, but it carries over most of SFAS
No. 125's provisions without reconsideration. SFAS No. 140 is effective for
transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishments of liabilities
occurring after March 31, 2001. SFAS No. 140 is effective for recognition and
reclassification of collateral and for disclosures relating to securitization
transactions and collateral for fiscal years ending after December 15, 2000.
Lionbridge does not expect the application of SFAS No. 140 to have a material
impact on its financial position or results of operations.

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

   Lionbridge is exposed to market risk related to changes in interest rates
and foreign currency exchange rates. Lionbridge does not use derivative
financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes.

   Interest Rate Risk. Lionbridge is exposed to market risk from changes in
interest rates primarily through its investing activities. In addition, its
ability to finance future acquisition transactions may be impacted if it is
unable to obtain appropriate financing at acceptable rates. Lionbridge's
investment portfolio consists primarily of investments in high-grade commercial
bank money market accounts. A hypothetical 10% increase or decrease in interest
rates would not have a material impact on the carrying value of its investments
due to their immediate available liquidity or their short maturity.

   Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Losses. The majority of Lionbridge's
contracts with clients are denominated in U.S. dollars. However, 36% of its
costs and expenses in 2000 and 59% of its costs and expenses in 1999 were
denominated in foreign currencies. 41% and 35% of its assets were recorded in
foreign currencies as of December 31, 2000 and 1999, respectively. 22% and 17%
of its liabilities were recorded in foreign currencies as of December 31, 2000
and 1999, respectively. Therefore, Lionbridge is exposed to foreign currency
exchange risks. Lionbridge has not historically tried to reduce its exposure to
exchange rate fluctuations by using hedging transactions. However, it may
choose to do so in the future. Lionbridge may not be able to do this
successfully. Accordingly, it may experience economic loss and a negative
impact on earnings and equity as a result of foreign currency exchange rate
fluctuations.

   Lionbridge does not currently compensate its directors. Each director is
reimbursed for reasonable travel and other out-of-pocket expenses incurred in
attending meetings of the board of directors or of any committee of the Board.
Non-employee directors are eligible to receive options to purchase shares of
common stock under Lionbridge's 1998 Stock Plan.

   On April 28, 2000, each of Messrs. Kavanagh and Sheer were granted an option
to purchase 2,000 shares of common stock under Lionbridge's 1998 Stock Plan, at
an exercise price of $11.375 per share, which was equal to the fair market
value of common stock on the date of grant.

(1) The exercise price equals the fair market value of the common stock as of
    the grant date as determined by Lionbridge's board of directors. Options
    have a term of ten years and become exercisable at the rate of 25% on the
    first anniversary of the date of grant and at the rate of 12.5% on each
    six-month anniversary thereafter.
(2) Amounts reported in these columns represent hypothetical gains that could
    be achieved for the respective options if exercised at the end of the
    option term. These gains are based on assumed rates of stock price
    appreciation of 5% and 10% compounded annually from the date the respective
    options were granted to their expiration date. These assumptions are not
    intended to forecast future appreciation of Lionbridge's stock price. The
    potential realizable value computation does not take into account federal
    or state income tax consequences of option exercises or sales of
    appreciated stock. Actual gains, if any, on stock option exercises and
    common stock holdings are dependent on the timing of the exercise and the
    future performance of Lionbridge's common stock. Lionbridge cannot assure
    that the rates of appreciation assumed in this table can be achieved or
    that the amounts reflected will be received by the individuals. This table
    does not take into account any appreciation in the price of the common
    stock since the date of grant.

Compensation Committee Report on Executive Compensation

   This report is submitted by the compensation committee. The compensation
committee during fiscal year 2000 was comprised of Messrs. de Chazal, Kavanagh
and Sheer, all of whom are non-employee directors. Pursuant to authority
delegated by the board of directors, the compensation committee is responsible
for reviewing and administering Lionbridge's stock plans and reviewing and
approving salaries and other incentive compensation of Lionbridge's officers
and employees, including the grant of stock options to officers and employees.
Pursuant to the authority delegated by the board of directors, the compensation
committee each year sets the compensation of the Chief Executive Officer and
reviews and approves the compensation of all other senior officers.

 Compensation Philosophy

   The goal of Lionbridge is to attract and retain qualified executives in a
competitive industry. To achieve this goal, the compensation committee applies
the philosophy that compensation of executive officers, specifically including
that of the Chief Executive Officer, should be linked to revenue growth,
operating results and earnings per share performance.

   Under the supervision of the compensation committee, Lionbridge has
developed and implemented compensation policies. The compensation committee's
executive compensation policies are designed to (i) enhance profitability of
Lionbridge and stockholder value, (ii) integrate compensation with Lionbridge's
annual and long-term performance goals, (iii) reward corporate performance,
(iv) recognize individual initiative, achievement and hard work, and (v) assist
Lionbridge in attracting and retaining qualified executive officers. Currently,
compensation under the executive compensation program is comprised of cash
compensation in the form of annual base salary, bonus, and long-term incentive
compensation in the form of stock options.

 Base Salary

   In setting cash compensation for the Chief Executive Officer and reviewing
and approving the cash compensation for all other officers, the compensation
committee reviews salaries annually. The compensation committee's policy is to
fix base salaries at levels comparable to the amounts paid to senior executives
with comparable qualifications, experience and responsibilities at other
companies of similar size and engaged in a similar business to that of
Lionbridge. In addition, the base salaries take into account Lionbridge's
relative performance as compared to comparable companies.

   The salary compensation for the executive officers is based upon their
qualifications, experience and responsibilities, as well as the attainment of
planned objectives. The Chief Executive Officer makes recommendations to the
compensation committee regarding the planned objectives and executive
compensation levels. The overall plans and operating performance levels upon
which management compensation is based are approved by the compensation
committee on an annual basis. During 2000, the Chief Executive Officer and the
President made recommendations for salary increases for the executive group,
and the compensation committee approved salary increases ranging from 6% to 8%
to Lionbridge's Senior Vice Presidents, in recognition of the achievements of
these officers during the year and/or in order to bring the officer's salary in
line with the competitive salary range for his or her position. In May 2000,
Mr. Jeanty joined Lionbridge as President and his annual base salary was set at
a level commensurate with his assumption of significant responsibilities and in
line with the competitive salary range for his position.

 Bonus Compensation

   In addition to salary compensation, the compensation committee recommended
the continuation of the bonus program adopted by the board of directors in the
previous year, whereby senior executives recommended

by the Chief Executive Officer and approved by the compensation committee for
inclusion in the program receive bonus compensation based on a percentage of
base salary. Bonuses paid under this program in 2001 were a percentage of base
salary for calendar 2000 and were based upon the individual's contributions to
the successful integration of INT'L.com with Lionbridge and the attainment of
strategic and operational goals and objectives.

 Stock Options

   The compensation committee relies on incentive compensation in the form of
stock options to retain and motivate executive officers and employees.
Incentive compensation in the form of stock options is designed (i) to provide
long-term incentives to executive officers and other employees, (ii) to
encourage the executive officers and other employees to remain with Lionbridge
and (iii) to enable them to develop and maintain a stock ownership position in
Lionbridge's common stock.

   Lionbridge's 1998 Stock Plan permits the compensation committee to
administer the granting of stock options to eligible employees, including
executive officers. Options generally become exercisable based upon a vesting
schedule tied to years of future service to Lionbridge. The value realizable
from exercisable options is dependent upon the extent to which Lionbridge's
performance is reflected in the market price of Lionbridge's common stock at
any particular point in time. Equity compensation in the form of stock options
is designed to provide long-term incentives to executive officers and other
employees. The compensation committee approves the granting of options in order
to motivate these employees to maximize stockholder value. Generally, options
are granted to officers and employees at fair market value on the date of grant
and vest over a four-year period.

   Option grants to employees are based on such factors as initiative,
achievement and performance. In administering grants to executive officers, the
compensation committee evaluates each officer's total equity compensation
package. The compensation committee generally reviews the option holdings of
each of the executive officers, including their vesting and exercise prices and
the then current value of any unvested options. The compensation committee
considers equity compensation to be an integral part of a competitive executive
compensation package and an important mechanism to align the interests of
management with those of Lionbridge's stockholders.

 Mr. Cowan's Compensation

   The cash compensation program for the Chief Executive Officer of Lionbridge
is designed to reward performance that enhances stockholder value. Mr. Cowan's
compensation package is comprised of base pay, bonus and stock options, and is
in part based on Lionbridge's revenue growth, profitability, and growth in
earnings per share. In 2000, Mr. Cowan's annual base salary was $259,875, the
same as in 1999 and a level comparable to the salary of Chief Executive
Officers in other globalization services companies, considering the size and
rate of profitability of those companies. In addition, Mr. Cowan was awarded a
cash bonus of $125,000 in recognition of his leadership of Lionbridge.

   The compensation committee is satisfied that the executive officers of
Lionbridge are dedicated to achieving significant improvements in the long-term
financial performance of Lionbridge and that the compensation policies and
programs implemented and administered have contributed and will continue to
contribute toward achieving this goal.

 Deductibility Of Executive Compensation

   In general, under Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as
amended (the "Code"), Lionbridge cannot deduct, for federal income tax
purposes, compensation in excess of $1,000,000 paid to certain executive
officers. This deduction limitation does not apply, however, to compensation
that constitutes "qualified performance-based compensation" within the meaning
of Section 162(m) of the Code and the regulations promulgated thereunder.
Lionbridge has considered the limitations on deductions imposed by

Section 162(m) of the Code, and it is Lionbridge's present intention that, for
so long as it is consistent with its overall compensation objective,
substantially all tax deductions attributable to executive compensation will
not be subject to the deduction limitations of Section 162(m) of the Code.

                                          Respectfully Submitted by the
                                           Compensation Committee:
                                          Guy L. de Chazal
                                          Paul Kavanagh
                                          Claude P. Sheer

CERTAIN RELATIONSHIPS AND RELATED TRANSACTIONS

   In February 1998, Lionbridge America, Inc., Lionbridge's predecessor holding
company, became a subsidiary of Lionbridge. Lionbridge accomplished this by
issuing an aggregate of 1,359,993 shares of its common stock, 13,271,314 shares
of its Series A convertible preferred stock and 140 shares of its Series D
nonvoting convertible preferred stock to Rory J. Cowan, five certain limited

Lionbridge Technologies Holdings, B.V.'s issuance of the note to Capital
Resource Lenders, many of Lionbridge's subsidiaries executed guarantees in
favor of Capital Resource Lenders. Stephen M. Jenks, a member of Capital
Research Partners III, L.L.C. which is the general partner of Capital Resource
Lenders, served as a member of Lionbridge's board of directors from March 1999
to August 1999 and Capital Resource Lenders held greater then 5% of the
outstanding shares of Lionbridge common stock from August 1999 to May 2000.

   In March 1999, Lionbridge and Lionbridge Technologies Holdings, B.V.
borrowed an aggregate of $2.0 million from the Morgan Stanley-sponsored limited

warrants exercisable for an aggregate of 255,544 shares of Lionbridge's common
stock at an exercise price of $0.015 per share. In connection with the issuance
of the notes to the Morgan Stanley-sponsored limited partnerships, many of
Lionbridge's subsidiaries executed guarantees in favor of the Morgan Stanley-
sponsored limited partnerships. In November 1999, the Morgan Stanley-sponsored
limited partnerships exercised the common stock purchase warrants in full.

   In connection with the closing of Lionbridge's initial public offering in
August 1999, the following transactions occurred:

  .  50% of the principal amount of the $12.0 million notes issued to Capital
     Resource Lenders and the Morgan Stanley-sponsored limited partnerships
     were paid in full;

  .  the 13,271,314 outstanding shares of its Series A convertible preferred
     stock and 140 outstanding shares of its Series D nonvoting convertible
     preferred stock held by its preferred stockholders including Mr. Cowan,
     Paul Kavanagh, the Advent-sponsored limited partnerships and the Morgan
     Stanley-sponsored limited partnerships were exchanged for an aggregate
     of 132.7145 shares of its Series B redeemable preferred stock and
     8,847,649 shares of its Series C convertible preferred stock. Paul
     Kavanagh has been a member of the Lionbridge board of directors since
     December 1996;

  .  the 132.7145 outstanding shares of Lionbridge's Series B redeemable
     preferred stock was redeemed for $100,000 per share plus an 8% annual
     premium. The redemption amount paid to Mr. Cowan, the Advent-sponsored
     limited partnerships, the Morgan Stanley-sponsored limited partnerships,
     and Mr. Kavanagh was $150,000, $1.3 million, $1.3 million, and $21,000,
     respectively; and

  .  the 8,847,649 outstanding shares of Lionbridge's Series C convertible
     preferred stock held by its preferred stockholders including Mr. Cowan,
     Mr. Kavanagh, the Advent-sponsored limited partnerships and the Morgan
     Stanley-sponsored limited partnerships were converted into 8,847,649
     shares of its common stock.

   In addition, the Advent-sponsored limited partnerships and the Morgan
Stanley-sponsored limited partnerships each purchased 364,000 shares of
Lionbridge common stock for $10.00 per share as part of Lionbridge's initial
public offering.

   In March 2001, Capital Resource Lenders and the Morgan Stanley-sponsored
limited partnerships agreed to defer, until the earlier of January 31, 2002 and
the completion of an underwritten public offering (other than Lionbridge's
initial public offering) with aggregate gross proceeds of at least $10.0
million, Lionbridge's repayment of $5.0 million and $1.0 million, respectively,
of the principal amount of the subordinated notes due in 2006. These notes had
previously required all of the principal amount to be repaid upon the earlier
of August 25, 2001 and the completion of an underwritten public offering (other
than Lionbridge's initial public offering) with aggregate gross proceeds of at
least $10.0 million.

   Lionbridge entered into a Second Restated Registration Rights Agreement
dated as of February 26, 1999 with Mr. Cowan, Mr. Kavanagh, the Advent-
sponsored limited partnerships, the Morgan Stanley-sponsored limited
partnerships, Capital Resource Lenders and certain other stockholders of
Lionbridge. This registration rights agreement provided these holders with
rights with respect to the registration by Lionbridge of their shares of
Lionbridge common stock under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended.

   Lionbridge has entered into a Third Restated Registration Rights Agreement
dated as of May 22, 2000 with Mr. Cowan, Mr. Kavanagh, the Advent-sponsored
limited partnerships, the Morgan Stanley-sponsored limited partnerships,
Capital Resource Lenders and certain other stockholders of Lionbridge. This
registration rights agreement provides these holders with rights with respect
to the registration by Lionbridge of their shares of Lionbridge common stock
under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended.

   Lionbridge believes that all transactions described above were made on terms
no less favorable to it than would have been obtained from unaffiliated third
parties. All future transactions, if any, with its executive officers,
directors and affiliates will be on terms no less favorable to it than could be
obtained from unrelated third parties and will be approved by a majority of the
board of directors and by a majority of the disinterested members of the board
of directors.

                         DESCRIPTION OF DATA DIMENSIONS

BUSINESS

General

   Data Dimensions and its subsidiaries provide comprehensive, outsourced
testing, quality assurance and application development and maintenance services
through a network of test labs, field consultants and an offshore applications
solution center. From 1991 through 1999, Data Dimensions derived the majority
of its revenue by providing solutions specifically related to the millennium
date change (Y2K). During 2000, Data Dimensions transitioned to its current
focus of quality assurance and testing services from a strategy of providing
more general information technology services, including Y2K and other
consulting services. Consistent with its strategy to focus on quality assurance
and testing services, Data Dimensions sold its data center outsourcing business
in December of 2000. Data Dimensions' clients consist primarily of product
development organizations and on-line service providers, ranging from large
organizations to emerging companies in the information technology,
manufacturing, financial services and pharmaceutical industries. Data
Dimensions was incorporated under Delaware law in 1968.

   Data Dimensions is organized into two divisions: quality assurance and
testing and application development and maintenance. Each division has a
mission to provide services that support specific market segments and
customers.

Industry Background

   Businesses continue to expand the use of technology to manage information
and processes and to create new and increasingly complex products.
Concurrently, software has become ubiquitous and an important component in the
development and delivery of products and services, ranging from traditional
business application software to the software built into cellular telephones,
automated teller machines, and point-of-sale devices. With each advance in
technology, new business products or processes are created and delivered to a
broader class of customers.

   Within this environment, many companies are challenged by the growth in the
demand for software, often outpacing their ability to design, build and test
that software. In the past, organizations have often sacrificed speed for
quality, or vice versa. However, in today's rapidly changing business
environment, as software becomes more business-critical, organizations can no
longer afford to sacrifice one for the other. It is becoming increasingly
important for businesses to adopt more effective approaches to their software
development and deployment process. Exacerbating the speed and quality trade-
off, software is becoming more complex, requiring coordinated teams of
professionals to develop and deploy it. These teams must work in unison to meet
today's increased speed and quality needs.

   Data Dimensions' management believes that certain market factors are driving
a demand for its services, including but not limited to, the ubiquity and
complexity of software, the growth of e-business, the existence of a shortage
of qualified and skilled personnel, the efficiencies of outsourcing, increased
time-to-market demands and growing concerns with security and privacy.

Strategy

   Data Dimensions' goal is to be the leading provider of outsourced quality
assurance and testing services. Its strategies include the following key
elements:

   Expand Quality Assurance and Testing Practice Areas. Data Dimensions intends
to further expand its quality assurance and testing services to address the
critical nature of today's software applications by increasing the breadth of
its services to include Web related applications, embedded devices, wireless
applications and accessibility testing. Further, Data Dimensions seeks to
leverage technology knowledge gained

in one practice area by adding similar quality assurance and testing services
in related areas (for example, infrared and Bluetooth technologies).

   Leverage Existing Clients. Data Dimensions seeks to increase the services
provided to its existing clients by selling to other product groups within
product development organizations and expanding the scope of initial
engagements with smaller, emerging companies.

   Expand Geographic Presence. Data Dimensions intends to expand the number of
its test centers to provide additional testing capacity and greater proximity
to clients.

   Develop Technology Partnerships and Alliances. Data Dimensions intends to
develop partnerships and other such relationships with leading vendors of
software testing tools to provide its clients with the most appropriate testing
platforms. Additionally, Data Dimensions intends to team with Web development
firms to provide third party testing services for end user clients.

Services

   Data Dimensions provides services designed to mitigate business risk and
allow its clients to gain confidence in their software applications. Its
services include:

   Quality Assurance and Testing. Comprehensive software quality assurance and
testing solutions for product development organizations and on-line service
providers from Data Dimensions' test centers and through its field consultants.

   Quality Assurance. Quality assurance consulting services to help client
organizations identify processes within their organization to prevent defects
(quality assurance). In addition, Data Dimensions helps implement processes
that address the client's need for defect detection (testing). These services
are most often delivered by Data Dimensions' field consultants at a client's
site rather than at its test centers. These services more specifically include:

  .  Quality Assurance Evaluation--often serving as an initial client
     engagement, the quality assurance evaluation is designed to assist
     clients in documenting, improving and/or streamlining their quality
     assurance and test function.

  .  Test Planning--assisting clients in the preparation and management of
     the overall testing process, including the review of current development
     activities, project objectives, and the business use of the
     applications/systems; developing a test strategy to establish the
     parameters for testing; developing a test plan for the testing effort;
     creating use cases, test cases, and test scripts.

  .  Quality Assurance Program Implementation--enactment of operational
     changes related to testing methodologies and disciplines, change
     management procedures, quality control practices, and/or application
     requirements/development standards.

   Testing. Application and system testing are critical steps in the release of
a new product or implementation of a new enterprise system. In-house testing
exposes companies to a greater risk of data contamination and can even
interfere with business-critical operations. Through a network of test centers
located in the United States and Ireland, Data Dimensions offers comprehensive
testing and training that results in production-quality products and systems.
During the process, Data Dimensions gains further insight into the latest
products, technologies and platforms. The following exemplifies the types of
testing services provided:

  .  Performance--Services include load/stress and scalability testing to
     determine whether features and functions perform within acceptable
     parameters for a positive user experience.

  .  Usability--Services include compatibility and functionality testing to
     determine whether features and functions perform as intended and
     interoperate as required.

  .  Compliance--Services include certification and validation testing to
     determine whether the software adheres to specifications.

  .  Universality--Services include accessibility testing and localization to
     determine whether the product or service supports the special needs of
     users less able, or to address language and cultural consistency.

   Application Development and Maintenance. Application development and
maintenance services help clients effectively manage and enhance existing
business systems to improve performance while better controlling costs. Under
this service offering, Data Dimensions manages clients' business applications
with the objective of improving software quality, processes, and costs.
Application development and maintenance engagements may also encompass
development of new applications, as directed by clients. Data Dimensions
operates an offshore application solution center in Galway, Ireland, in concert
with on-site consultants, to provide its clients with application development
and maintenance services across a range of platforms and operating
environments. Data Dimensions' application development and maintenance services
include:

  .  Application and Web development--the design and coding of new
     applications such as knowledge portal development, legacy application
     extension and application integration.

  .  Application maintenance and production support--management, enhancement
     and support of existing computer applications.

Sales, Marketing and Clients

   Data Dimensions markets its services through its direct sales force located
throughout the continental United States and United Kingdom. As of March 31,
2001, the direct sales force was comprised of 18 employees. Data Dimensions
focuses its marketing efforts on product development organizations, on-line
service providers and commercial organizations with significant technology
needs that can be addressed by Data Dimensions' quality assurance consulting,
testing, and application outsourcing services. While Data Dimensions performs
work for organizations in a wide variety of industries, most of its revenue is
derived from the following industry groups: information technology,
manufacturing, financial services and pharmaceuticals.

   Data Dimensions has historically derived, and may in the future derive, a
significant percentage of its total revenue from a relatively small number of
clients. Its ten largest clients accounted for approximately 55 percent and 48
percent of its total revenue during the years ended December 31, 2000 and 1999,
respectively. Hewlett-Packard accounted for approximately 17 percent and the
Los Angeles Department of Water and Power accounted for approximately 11
percent of Data Dimensions' consolidated revenue in 2000 and 1999,
respectively.

   Y2K remediation services accounted for approximately 3% and 76% of Data
Dimensions' total revenue during the years ended December 31, 2000 and 1999,
respectively. Data Dimensions does not expect any future Y2K related revenue.

   Data Dimensions relies on its dedicated sales force to generate new clients
as well as pursue potential leads related to its quality assurance and testing
offerings. To this end, Data Dimensions' sales personnel are encouraged to
engage in direct marketing techniques including visits to businesses within
Data Dimensions' target market. In addition, the sales force responds to
requests for proposals, follows-up on client referrals and pursues leads
resulting from company sponsored seminars, direct mail campaigns, industry
conferences and in-bound client inquiries.

   Data Dimensions utilizes two independent sales representatives in connection
with sales of its application development and maintenance services. These sales
representatives operate under contracts, with one-year terms, that define the
territory and commission structure under which they market Data Dimensions'
services.

   Data Dimensions has previously entered into license agreements with certain
domestic and international organizations pursuant to which the licensees could
resell agreed-upon company products, as well as, utilize Data Dimensions'
methodology in performing Y2K project work. These licenses were generally
exclusive to a specific geographical territory. As more fully described in Note
4 to its Consolidated Financial Statements, during 1999, Data Dimensions
discontinued its product-based business and consequently does not expect to
utilize such license agreements in the future.

Intellectual Property

   Data Dimensions has no patents or patent applications pending relating to
its application development and maintenance or quality assurance and testing
businesses and relies on a combination of trade secret, nondisclosure and other
contractual agreements, and copyright and trademark laws to protect its
intellectual property rights. This intellectual property largely consists of a
documented set of processes (Modular Repeatable Processes) utilized in Data
Dimensions' application development and maintenance business and certain
software applications related to software error logging and reporting utilized
in its quality assurance and testing business.

   Existing trade secret and copyright laws provide only limited protection.
Data Dimensions enters into confidentiality agreements with its employees, and
requires outside consultants and some clients to enter into such agreements.
Data Dimensions also protects its proprietary information by limiting access to
and distribution of proprietary information. There can be no assurance that
these arrangements will be adequate to deter misappropriation of proprietary
information.

   Data Dimensions' intellectual property has also consisted of its Millennium
Process and Ardes 2k which were related to its Y2K offerings. The Millennium
Process consists of a documented set of procedures for resolving the widespread
problems caused by the inability of certain computer systems to properly
interpret dates for the year 2000 and beyond. Data Dimensions has licensed the
use of the Millennium Process to consulting firms located throughout the world.

   The Millennium Process has not been the subject of an infringement claim,
however there can be no assurance that third parties will not assert
infringement claims against Data Dimensions in the future, that assertion of
such claims will not result in litigation, or that Data Dimensions would
prevail in such litigation or be able to obtain a license for the use of any
infringed intellectual property from a third party on commercially reasonable
terms. Furthermore, litigation, regardless of its outcome, could result in
substantial cost to, and diversion of effort by, Data Dimensions. Any
infringement claim or litigation against Data Dimensions could, therefore,
materially and adversely affect Data Dimensions' business, operating results
and financial condition.

   As more fully described in Note 4 to its Consolidated Financial Statements,
during 1999, Data Dimensions discontinued its product-based business and
consequently does not expect additional revenue to be derived from its
Millennium Process or Ardes 2k products.

Product and Technology Development

   Data Dimensions invested approximately $52,000 in capitalized product
development costs in 1998 and has made no investment since then. The costs
incurred in 1998 consisted of personnel and other related expenses to develop
Ardes 2K and Interactive Vendor Review. These products have been sold directly
to client and to third-party providers, including computer and software
companies, and consultants. Data Dimensions recorded product and technology
development expense, including amortization of the capitalized costs of $0,
$900,000 and $672,000 in 2000, 1999 and 1998, respectively. These amounts
include write-downs of capitalized product development of $388,000 in 1999,
which is included in non-recurring charges in the Consolidated Statement of
Operations of Data Dimensions.

Competition

   The market for Data Dimensions' services is highly fragmented with many
competitors and low barriers to entry. The competitive market factors are
service, price, flexibility and responsiveness, and the expertise and
experience of the personnel provided to clients. Data Dimensions' competitors
include:

  .  Independent testing labs and divisions of IT organizations, such as
     VeriTest (a division of Lionbridge) and Ajilon Software Quality Partners
     (a division of Adecco, SA).

  .  The professional services divisions of larger organizations, such as
     International Business Machines, Unisys Corporation and Accenture.

  .  Companies such as Keane Inc., Computer Horizons, Inc., and Ciber Inc.

  .  Internal quality assurance and testing departments of Global 2000 and
     emerging companies.

   Data Dimensions believes its primary advantages in the market are the
experience and expertise of its personnel in providing quality testing
solutions in conjunction with a high degree of flexibility and responsiveness
to clients' requirements.

   Some of Data Dimensions' competitors are more established, benefit from
greater name recognition and have substantially greater financial, technical
and marketing resources than Data Dimensions. Moreover, other than the need for
technical expertise, there are no significant proprietary or other barriers to
entry in the quality assurance and testing market.

Employees

   As of March 31, 2001, Data Dimensions employed approximately 320 full-time
employees. None of Data Dimensions' employees are represented by a labor union,
and Data Dimensions has never experienced a work stoppage. Data Dimensions
considers its relationship with its employees to be good. Data Dimensions
supplements its full-time employees, when necessary, with administrative and
technical contractors and temporary personnel. As of March 31, 2001, Data
Dimensions engaged 90 contractors and temporary personnel.

Properties

   Data Dimensions maintains its headquarters in a leased facility in Bellevue,
Washington, which lease will expire in 2002. In addition, it maintains leased
office space for testing labs and small regional offices in the US. Data
Dimensions also leases facilities in Cheshire, England and Galway, Ireland.
Most of Data Dimensions leases have terms in excess of one year and management
believes its facilities are in good condition.

Legal Proceedings

   Data Dimensions is not a party to any material legal proceedings.

Overview

   Data Dimensions provides comprehensive, outsourced testing, quality
assurance (QA) and application development and maintenance (ADM) services
through a network of test labs, field consultants and an offshore applications
solution center. From 1991 through 1999, Data Dimensions derived the majority
of its revenue by providing solutions specifically related to the millennium
date change (Y2K). During 2000, Data Dimensions transitioned to its current
focus of providing QA and test services from a strategy of providing more
general information technology services, including Y2K and other consulting
services. Data Dimensions' clients consist primarily of product development
organizations and on-line service providers, ranging from large organizations
to emerging companies in the information technology, manufacturing, financial
services and pharmaceutical industries.

   In December 2000, Data Dimensions sold its data center outsourcing
subsidiary, Data Dimension Information Services, in a cash transaction. Data
Dimensions received $1.8 million of the $5.4 million purchase price at the
closing of the transaction, and the remaining balance was paid in January 2001.
The financial results have been presented to reflect this business as a
discontinued operation for all periods presented.

   In August 1998, in a pooling of interests transaction, Data Dimensions
acquired ST Labs, Inc., a Bellevue, Washington based company that provided
information technology quality assurance and testing services to its customers.
At the time of the merger, ST Labs became a wholly owned subsidiary of Data
Dimensions. On February 1, 1999, ST Labs was merged into Data Dimensions and
the business of ST Labs, along with other testing services, is now conducted
using the name Data Dimensions Test Centers and forms the basis of Data
Dimensions' QA and testing services.

   Data Dimensions markets its QA and testing services in the United States
through a direct sales force and utilizes independent sales representatives to
sell its ADM services. Data Dimensions has previously leveraged its Y2K
technology by licensing the right to use its Y2K consulting process to
consulting firms operating in more than fifty countries worldwide. It is not
expected that such licensing will be applicable in the future. Data Dimensions
has an office near London, England to market its services to the United Kingdom
and European markets.

   Data Dimensions' QA and testing and ADM revenue consists primarily of
billable hours for services provided by its technical consultants multiplied by
contract rates, and this revenue is recognized when services are performed.
Direct costs consist primarily of salaries, benefits, and other costs directly
related to services provided.

   The level of gross margin primarily depends on the productivity of Data
Dimensions' billable personnel. Productivity is based on the number of billable
personnel and their billing rates, the number of working days in a period and
the number of hours worked per day. Billable personnel are paid salaries;
however, clients are most often charged a time-based rate. Data Dimensions' QA
and testing and ADM gross margins may vary due to the differing salary
structures for its billable personnel, utilization rates and contract
durations.

   General, administrative and selling expenses consist primarily of
administrative personnel compensation and benefits, recruiting, marketing,
promotion, investor relations, office expenses, travel, and other general
overhead.

   Data Dimensions conducts its business through two operating divisions
consisting of QA and testing, and ADM.

   QA and Testing: Through a network of test centers and on-site field
consultants, Data Dimensions provides comprehensive, outsourced software
quality assurance and test solutions for product development organizations and
on-line service providers including practice areas of printers and peripherals,
publishing and education, embedded systems and Web testing.

   Application Development and Maintenance: Under this service offering, Data
Dimensions manages clients' business applications with the objective of
improving software quality, processes, and costs. ADM engagements may also
encompass development of new applications, as directed by clients. Data
Dimensions operates an offshore application solution center in Galway, Ireland,
in concert with on-site consultants, to provide its clients with ADM services
across a range of platforms and operating environments.

Comparison of 2000 to 1999

   Data Dimensions' 2000 total revenue of $32.4 million decreased 64 percent
from revenue of $90.4 million in 1999. The decline in total revenue is largely
attributed to a decline in Y2K remediation projects, which provided the
majority of 1999 revenue. QA and testing revenue of $20.6 million increased 57
percent from revenue of $13.1 million in 1999 due largely to the addition of a
field delivered quality assurance practice, as well as, increased customer
billings at certain larger test center clients. ADM revenue increased 300
percent to $7.2 million in 2000 compared to $1.8 in 1999, its first year of
operations. The increase in revenue was largely caused by an increased number
of customer contracts.

   Gross margin as a percentage of revenue decreased to 31 percent in 2000 from
45 percent in 1999. Contributing to the decrease was a lower utilization rate
of Data Dimensions' field consultants as Y2K projects were completed, without a
corresponding increase in non-Y2K business. Data Dimensions reduced its field
consulting workforce in the third and fourth quarters of 2000 as it exited
certain markets and focused on providing QA and testing, and ADM services.

   General, administrative and selling expense of $25.7 million decreased 32
percent from $37.7 million in 1999. The decrease was primarily due to a
decrease in the number of employees in sales and administrative functions, as
well as overall expense reductions. Data Dimensions reduced general,
administrative and sales resources in the third and fourth quarters of 2000 as
it exited certain markets and focused on providing QA and testing, and ADM
services. This was offset, somewhat by an expense of $2.1 million related to
increasing the allowance for bad debts in the fourth quarter of 2000. General,
administrative and selling expense represented 79 percent of total revenue in
2000 compared to 42 percent in 1999 due to the decrease in revenue.

   Non-recurring income of $136,000 in 2000 related to the reversal of certain
restructuring charges associated with Data Dimensions' 1999 restructuring
activity. The reversal was due to increased voluntary terminations. Non-
recurring charges of $1.2 million in 1999, more fully described in Note 4 to
Data Dimensions Consolidated Financial Statements, resulted from the transition
from providing products and consulting services addressing Y2K remediation to
providing information technology consulting and other services. The 1999 charge
was for severance costs and asset write-downs associated with Data Dimensions'
restructuring efforts as part of this transition.

   Income (loss) from continuing operations, net of tax was a loss of $11.1
million in 2000 versus income of $2.0 million in 1999. The loss in 2000
resulted from reduced gross margins on significantly less revenue and higher
general, administrative and selling expenses in relation to revenue.

   Net income (loss) was a loss of $9.5 million in 2000 and reflective of a
loss from discontinued operations of $1.5 million and a gain on the sale of the
discontinued operations of $3.1 million. In 1999, net income was $843,000
reflecting a loss from discontinued operations of $1.1 million.

   The annual effective tax rate in 2000 was 28 percent versus 39 percent in
1999. The 1999 rate is higher than the statutory rate due largely to state
income tax provisions. This was offset, to some extent, by income generated by
foreign entities operating in jurisdictions, which have lower tax rates. The
tax losses incurred in 2000 can be carried back and applied to 1998 and 1999
federal taxes paid, subject to certain limitations. The limitations and the
fact that certain states do not provide for carryback provisions reduced the
benefit generated by the tax losses.

Comparison of 1999 to 1998

   Data Dimensions' 1999 total revenue of $90.4 million decreased 11 percent
from revenue of $101.7 million in 1998. The decline in total revenue can
largely be attributed to a decline in Y2K remediation projects, which provided
the majority of 1999 and 1998 revenue. QA and testing revenue of $13.1 million
decreased 5 percent from revenue of $13.7 million in 1998 due largely to an
overall reduction in average revenue per project, partially offset by an
increase in Web related testing. ADM revenue was $1.8 million in 1999, its
first year of operation.

   Gross margin as a percentage of revenue decreased to 45 percent in 1999 from
52 percent in 1998. Contributing to the decrease was a lower utilization rate
of Data Dimensions' field consultants as Y2K projects were completed, without a
corresponding increase in non-Y2K business. As more fully described in Note 4
to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Data Dimensions initiated a
restructuring plan in the third quarter of 1999 to better align its expenses
with revenue expectations.

   General, administrative and selling expense of $37.7 million decreased 3
percent from $38.8 million in 1998. The decrease was primarily due to a
reduction in the number of employees in sales and administrative functions in
the second half of the year. As more fully described in Note 4 to Data
Dimensions Consolidated Financial Statements, Data Dimensions initiated a
restructuring plan in the third quarter of 1999 to better align its expenses
with revenue expectations, producing lowered general, administrative and
selling expenses in the second half of 1999. General, administrative and
selling expense represented 42 percent of total revenue in 1999 compared to 38
percent in 1998.

   Non-recurring charges in 1999 were $1.2 million compared to $757,000 in
1998. The 1999 charge, more fully described in Note 4 to the Consolidated
Financial Statements, resulted from Data Dimensions' transition from providing
products and consulting services addressing Y2K remediation to providing
information technology consulting and other services. The 1999 charge was for
severance costs and asset write-downs associated with Data Dimensions
restructuring efforts as part of this transition. The 1998 charge was for
merger related costs for the ST Labs acquisition in August 1998.

   The income from litigation settlement of $1.9 million in 1999 represents a
settlement with an international licensee concerning royalties owed Data
Dimensions related to Y2K work performed under license agreements.

   Income from continuing operations, net of tax decreased to $2.0 million in
1999 from $7.8 million in 1998. The decrease in 1999 resulted from reduced
gross margins and higher general, administrative and selling expenses in
relation to revenue.

   Net income of $843,000 in 1999 and $9.2 million in 1998 reflects a loss from
discontinued operations of $1.1 million in 1999 and income from discontinued
operations of $1.4 million in 1998.

   The annual effective tax rate in 1999 and 1998 was 39 percent. This is
higher than the statutory rate due largely to state income tax provisions. This
was offset, to some extent, by income generated by foreign entities operating
in jurisdictions, which have lower tax rates.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

   At December 31, 2000, Data Dimensions had $15.1 million of working capital,
of which $2.1 million was cash and cash equivalents. Also included in current
assets is a federal income tax receivable of $4.5 million. Data Dimensions
expects to receive a refund of taxes paid in 1998 and 1999 as a result of
carrying the tax losses of 2000 back against previous years income. Data
Dimensions acquired $1.4 million, $1.5 million and $3.6 million of equipment
and furniture, primarily computer equipment and office furniture, in 2000, 1999
and 1998, respectively. Data Dimensions expects to spend a lesser amount on
equipment and furniture in 2001 than in 2000. Data Dimensions significantly
increased its allowance for bad debts in the fourth quarter of 2000 in response
to slowing payments and funding difficulty of some of its clients. In addition,
several clients filed for bankruptcy late in the year and these amounts have
been written-off.

   Cash flow from operating activities was $(6.7) million, $12.9 million and
$1.9 million in the years ended December 31, 2000, 1999 and 1998, respectively.
The negative cash flow in 2000 was primarily related to the operating losses
incurred during the year. Continued operating losses would require additional
sources of liquidity in order for Data Dimensions to meet its cash
requirements. Sources of additional liquidity may be difficult to acquire or
may be on terms not favorable to Data Dimensions. If additional liquidity is
not available, Data Dimensions will need to reduce its expenses to ensure
adequate liquidity for ongoing operating expenses.

   Data Dimensions had a $10 million, two-year, working capital, revolving line
of credit with a bank that expired in June 2000. In January 2001, Data
Dimensions entered into a line of credit agreement with another commercial bank
under which it can borrow up to $7.5 million based on the value of certain
current assets. The agreement calls for Data Dimensions to meet certain
financial covenants. In conjunction with the line of credit, Data Dimensions
issued warrants for the purchase of 150,000 shares of common stock at an
exercise price of $0.90 per share and 75,000 shares of common stock at an
exercise price of $0.75 per share. The value ascribed to these warrants is
immaterial.

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

   Data Dimensions has a line of credit that has borrowing rates subject to
market rates. An increase in market rates would make financing more expensive
for Data Dimensions. In addition, Data Dimensions' clients may be impacted by
fluctuations in interest rates or foreign currency rates, which may impact
their need for Data Dimensions' services. Data Dimensions had no market rate
sensitive instruments, positions or transactions at December 31, 2000.

    COMPARISON OF RIGHTS OF STOCKHOLDERS OF DATA DIMENSIONS AND LIONBRIDGE

General

   This section of the proxy statement/prospectus describes the material
differences between the rights of holders of Data Dimensions common stock and
holders of Lionbridge common stock. While Data Dimensions and Lionbridge
believe that the description covers the material differences between the two,
this summary is not intended to be a complete discussion of the respective
certificates of incorporation and by-laws of Data Dimensions and Lionbridge
and it is qualified in its entirety to applicable Delaware law as well as to
Data Dimensions' and Lionbridge's respective certificates of incorporation and
by-laws. You should carefully read this entire summary and the other documents
we refer to for a more complete understanding of the differences between being
a stockholder of Data Dimensions and being a stockholder of Lionbridge. Data
Dimensions' and Lionbridge's respective certificates of incorporation and by-
laws are on file with the SEC and will also be sent to you upon request. For
more information, see "Where You Can Find More Information" on page 106.

   Both Data Dimensions and Lionbridge are incorporated under the laws of the
state of Delaware. Accordingly, the rights of their stockholders are governed
by Delaware law and by their respective certificates of incorporation and by-
laws. If the merger is completed, stockholders of Data Dimensions will become
stockholders of Lionbridge and the rights of the former stockholders of Data
Dimensions will be governed by

Delaware law, the Lionbridge certificate of incorporation and the Lionbridge
by-laws. The following summarizes differences in the certificates of
incorporation of Data Dimensions and Lionbridge that could materially affect
the rights of stockholders of Data Dimensions after completion of the merger.

Capitalization

   Lionbridge. Lionbridge is authorized to issue 100,000,000 shares of common
stock and 5,000,000 shares of preferred stock. On March 31, 2001, 28,038,697
shares of Lionbridge common stock were issued and outstanding and no shares of
preferred stock were issued and outstanding. Lionbridge's board has the
authority, without stockholder approval, to issue shares of authorized
preferred stock from time to time in one or more series and to fix the rights
and preferences, including voting rights, of each series of preferred stock,
which rights and preferences may be superior to that of Lionbridge common
stock.

   Data Dimensions. Data Dimensions is authorized to issue 20,000,000 shares of
$0.001 par value common stock. As of March 31, 2001, 13,560,972 shares of Data
Dimensions common stock were issued and outstanding.

Voting

   Lionbridge. Each holder of Lionbridge common stock is entitled to one vote
for each share and may not cumulate votes. Except as otherwise required by law
or provided in the Lionbridge certificate of incorporation, the holders of
Lionbridge common stock and Lionbridge preferred stock vote together as a
single class on all matters voted on by the Lionbridge stockholders.

   Data Dimensions. Each holder of Data Dimensions common stock is entitled to
cast one vote, in person or by proxy, for each share held, on all matters to be
voted on by the stockholders of the company. All elections are determined by a
plurality of the votes cast, and except as otherwise required by Data
Dimensions' certificate of incorporation or by Delaware law, all other matters
are determined by a majority of the votes cast affirmatively or negatively. Any
business combination with a beneficial owner of 30% or more of the Data
Dimensions' capital stock entitled to vote on such business combination must be
approved by holders of 66 2/3% of the remaining capital stock entitled to be
voted on the business combination, excluding the shares of capital stock held
by the 30% beneficial owner.

Number and Classification of Directors

   Lionbridge. Lionbridge's by-laws provide that the number of directors may
not be less than three. Lionbridge's by-laws and certificate of incorporation
provide that its board of directors will be comprised of three classes with no
one class having more than one director more than any other class. Each class
is elected for three years and a different class of directors stands for
election each year.

   Data Dimensions. Data Dimensions' by-laws provide that the number of
directors which constitute the entire board of directors may not be less than
three nor more than fifteen, the specific number to be fixed from time to time
by resolution of the board of directors. The affirmative vote of the holders of
66 2/3% of the common stock of Data Dimensions is required for the amendment or
repeal by the stockholders of that section of the by-laws of Data Dimensions
which fixes the total number of directors. Data Dimensions' by-laws and
certificate of incorporation provide that its board of directors is to be
comprised of three classes, with each class consisting of one-third of the
number of directors constituting the entire board of directors. In instances
where the total number of directors is a number other than a multiple of three,
the number of directors to be elected to each class is to reasonably
approximate the number which would have been elected to such class had the
total number of directors been a multiple of three. Each class is elected for
three years and a different class of directors stands for election each year.

Removal of Directors

   Lionbridge. Lionbridge's by-laws and certificate of incorporation provide
that the stockholders may remove a director for cause by the affirmative vote
of the holders of at least a majority of the shares of the capital stock of
Lionbridge outstanding and entitled to vote or without cause by the affirmative
vote of holders of at least 75% of the shares of the capital stock of
Lionbridge outstanding and entitled to vote.

   Data Dimensions. Data Dimensions' by-laws provide that the stockholders may
remove a director or the entire board of directors at any time, but only for
cause and only by the affirmative vote of the holders of at least a majority of
the capital stock of the company.

Filling Vacancies on the Board of Directors

   Lionbridge. Lionbridge's by-laws and certificate of incorporation provide
that the directors will fill a vacancy on the board, including a vacancy caused
by an enlargement of the board, by a vote of the majority of the directors then
in office, even if they constitute less than a quorum, or by a sole remaining
director. A director elected to fill a vacancy will be elected to hold office
until the next election of the class for which the director was elected and
until a successor is elected and qualified.

   Data Dimensions. Data Dimensions' by-laws and certificate of incorporation
provide that the directors will fill a vacancy on the board of directors,
including a vacancy caused by an enlargement of the board of directors, by a
vote of the majority of the directors then in office, even if they constitute
less than a quorum. A director elected to fill a vacancy will be elected to
hold office until the next election of the class for which the director was
elected and until a successor is elected and qualified.

Amendments to Certificate of Incorporation

   Lionbridge. Lionbridge's certificate of incorporation provides that any
proposal amending Lionbridge's certificate of incorporation to reduce or
eliminate the number of its authorized shares of common stock or preferred
stock, or relating to Lionbridge's perpetual existence, the board of directors
generally, stockholder action and special meetings of stockholders, personal
liability of directors, indemnification, factors the board may consider in
connection with mergers and acquisitions or amending the certificate of
incorporation requires the affirmative vote of at least 75% of the shares of
capital stock of Lionbridge outstanding and entitled to vote.

   Data Dimensions. Data Dimensions' certificate of incorporation provides that
the company reserves the right to amend, alter, change or repeal any provision
of its certificate of incorporation in the manner prescribed by statute.

Amendments to By-laws

   Lionbridge. Lionbridge's by-laws provide that the directors may amend the
by-laws by the affirmative vote of a majority of the directors present at any
regular or special meeting at which a quorum is present. In addition,
Lionbridge's by-laws also provide that the stockholders may amend the by-laws
by the affirmative vote of 75% of the shares of Lionbridge capital stock
outstanding and entitled to vote at any regular or special meeting of
stockholders.

   Data Dimensions. Data Dimensions' by-laws provide that the directors may
amend the by-laws by the affirmative vote of a majority of the authorized
directors, whether or not there exist any vacancies in previously authorized
directorships at such time. The by-laws also provide that the stockholders may
adopt, amend or repeal the by-laws.

Action by Written Consent

   Lionbridge. Lionbridge's certificate of incorporation and by-laws provide
that the stockholders may not take any action by written consent in lieu of a
meeting.

   Data Dimensions. As permitted by Delaware law, action required or permitted
to be taken at any annual or special meeting of stockholders of Data
Dimensions, may be taken without a meeting, without prior notice and without a
vote, by the written consent of stockholders having not less than the minimum
number of votes that would be necessary to authorize or take the action at a
meeting at which all shares entitled to vote thereon were present and voted.

Notice of Stockholder Actions

   Lionbridge. Lionbridge's by-laws provide that to nominate directors or bring
business before an annual meeting, stockholders must give written notice to the
Secretary of Lionbridge at least 120 days, but not more than 150 days, prior to
the first anniversary of the date of the proxy statement delivered to
stockholders in connection with the preceding year's annual meeting. However,
if the annual meeting is more than 30 days before or 60 days after the
anniversary date or if no proxy statement was delivered to stockholders in
connection with the preceding year's annual meeting, stockholders must give
written notice not more than 90 days prior to the annual meeting and not less
than the later of 60 days prior to the annual meeting and 10 days after
Lionbridge makes the first public announcement of the date of the meeting.

   Data Dimensions. Data Dimensions' by-laws provide that to nominate directors
or otherwise bring business before a stockholder meeting, stockholders must
give written notice to the Secretary of Data Dimensions at least 75 days, but
not more than 90 days, prior to the date of the stockholder meeting. If,
however, less than 90 days' notice or prior public disclosure of the date of
the stockholder meeting is given or made to stockholders, notice by the
stockholder must be given not later than the close of business on the fifteenth
day following the day on which the notice of meeting was mailed or the public
disclosure made, whichever first occurs.

Right to Call Special Meeting of Stockholders

   Lionbridge. Lionbridge's by-laws provide that the chairman of the board of
directors, a majority of the board of directors or the President may call a
special meeting of stockholders at any time.

   Data Dimensions. Data Dimensions' by-laws provide that the board of
directors or the President may call a special meeting of stockholders at any
time. The President and Secretary are to call a special meeting of the
stockholders upon the written request of stockholders holding a majority of the
capital stock of the company.

Limitation of Personal Liability of Directors

   The Delaware General Corporation Law provides that a corporation's
certificate of incorporation may include a provision limiting the personal
liability of a director to the corporation or its stockholders for monetary
damages for breach of fiduciary duty as a director. However, no provision can
eliminate or limit the liability of a director for:

  .  any breach of the director's duty of loyalty to the corporation or its
     stockholders;

  .  acts or omissions not in good faith or which involve intentional
     misconduct or a knowing violation of the law;

  .  willful or negligent violation of the laws governing the payment of
     dividends or the purchase or redemption of stock; or

  .  any transaction from which the director derived an improper personal
     benefit.

   Lionbridge. The Lionbridge certificate of incorporation provides that no
director shall be personally liable to Lionbridge or its stockholders for
monetary damages for breach of fiduciary duty as director, notwithstanding any
provision of law imposing liability, except:

  .  for any breach of the director's duty of loyalty to Lionbridge or its
     stockholders;

  .  for acts or omissions not in good faith or which involve intentional
     misconduct or a knowing violation of law;

  .  under Section 174 of the General Corporation Law of the State of
     Delaware; or

  .  for any transaction from which the director derived an improper personal
     benefit.

   Data Dimensions. The Data Dimensions certificate of incorporation provides
that no director will be personally liable to Data Dimensions or its
stockholders for monetary damages for breach of fiduciary duty as a director,
notwithstanding any provision of law imposing such liability, except:

  .  for any breach of the director's duty of loyalty to Data Dimensions or
     its stockholders;

  .  for acts or omissions not in good faith or which involve intentional
     misconduct or a knowing violation of law;

  .  under Section 174 of the General Corporation Law of the State of
     Delaware; or

  .  for any transaction from which the director derived an improper personal
     benefit.

Dividends

   Lionbridge. Lionbridge's certificate of incorporation provides that
Lionbridge's board may declare and pay dividends upon shares of Lionbridge
common stock, but only out of funds available for the payment of dividends as
provided by law, and subject to any preferential rights of any outstanding
preferred stock. The terms of Lionbridge's credit facility with Silicon Valley
Bank prohibit the payment of cash dividends to Lionbridge by its European
subsidiaries and the terms of Lionbridge's subordinated notes held by Capital
Resource Lenders and the Morgan Stanley limited partnerships prohibit
Lionbridge from paying any dividends to the Lionbridge stockholders.

   Data Dimensions. As permitted by the Delaware General Corporation Law, Data
Dimensions' board may declare and pay dividends upon shares of Data Dimensions
common stock, but only out of funds available for the payment of dividends as
provided by law.

Conversion and Redemption

   Lionbridge. Holders of Lionbridge common stock have no right to convert
their shares into any other shares of capital stock of Lionbridge or any other
securities. Holders of Lionbridge common stock are not entitled to any
redemption rights.

   Data Dimensions. In accordance with the Delaware General Corporation Law,
holders of Data Dimensions common stock have no right to convert their shares
into any other shares of capital stock of Data Dimensions or any other
securities. Holders of Data Dimensions common stock are not entitled to any
redemption rights.

Liquidation

   Lionbridge. Lionbridge's certificate of incorporation provides that upon the
dissolution or liquidation of Lionbridge, holders of Lionbridge common stock
will be entitled to receive all assets of Lionbridge available for distribution
to Lionbridge's stockholders, subject to any preferential rights of any then
outstanding preferred stock.

   Data Dimensions. In accordance with the Delaware General Corporation Law,
upon the dissolution or liquidation of Data Dimensions, holders of Data
Dimensions common stock will be entitled to receive all assets of Data
Dimensions available for distribution to Data Dimensions' stockholders.

                       RIGHTS OF DISSENTING STOCKHOLDERS

   Under Delaware law, Data Dimensions stockholders who vote against the merger
and the agreement and plan of reorganization will have no statutory right of
appraisal to receive the "fair value" of their shares in cash rather than the
Lionbridge common stock specified in the agreement and plan of reorganization.

                      GOVERNMENT AND REGULATORY APPROVALS

   Other than compliance with federal and state securities laws applicable for
the issuance of Lionbridge common stock in the merger and with respect to the
soliciting the votes of the Data Dimensions stockholders to approve the merger
and compliance with the Delaware General Corporation Law, Lionbridge and Data
Dimensions do not believe that any material federal or state governmental
approvals or actions will be required for completion of the merger.

   While no antitrust approvals are required to consummate the merger, at any
time before the effective time of the merger, the Antitrust Division of the
Department of Justice, the Federal Trade Commission or a private person or
entity could seek under antitrust laws, among other things, to enjoin the
merger and any time after the effective time of the merger, to cause Lionbridge
to divest itself, in whole or in part, of the surviving corporation of the
merger or of certain businesses conducted by the surviving corporation of the
merger. There can be no assurance that a challenge to the merger will not be
made or that, if such a challenge is made, Lionbridge will prevail. For more
information, see "The Agreement and Plan of Reorganization--Conditions to
Completion of the Merger" on page 49.

          UNAUDITED PRO FORMA COMBINED CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

   On March 8, 2001, Lionbridge Technologies, Inc. ("Lionbridge") entered into
an agreement to acquire all of the capital stock of Data Dimensions, Inc.
("Data Dimensions"). The transaction is intended to be a tax-free, stock-for-
stock transaction, accounted for using the purchase method of accounting.
Lionbridge will issue approximately 2,588,570 shares of its common stock in
exchange for all of the capital stock of Data Dimensions and up to
approximately 450,000 additional shares of its common stock upon the exercise
of outstanding options and warrants of Data Dimensions being assumed by
Lionbridge.

   The unaudited pro forma combined condensed financial information should be
read in conjunction with the historical financial statements and the related
notes thereto of Lionbridge and Data Dimensions which are presented in this
joint proxy statement/prospectus. See "Where You Can Find More Information."
The unaudited pro forma combined condensed balance sheet gives effect to the
acquisition as if it had occurred on December 31, 2000 and includes all
material pro forma adjustments necessary for this purpose. The unaudited pro
forma combined condensed statement of operations combines Lionbridge's
operating results for the year ended December 31, 2000 with the operating
results of Data Dimensions for the same period. The unaudited pro forma
combined condensed statement of operations gives effect to the acquisition as
if it had occurred on January 1, 2000 and includes all material pro forma
adjustments necessary for this purpose.

   Lionbridge expects to incur costs of the acquisition principally in the
quarter in which the acquisition is consummated. Such costs, which are
currently estimated to be approximately $500,000, will primarily consist of
fees to legal counsel and independent accountants, and printing and other fees
and expenses relating to preparing this joint proxy statement/prospectus.
However, additional unanticipated expenses may be incurred in connection with
this transaction. The unaudited pro forma combined condensed financial
statements reflect these estimated transaction costs.

   The unaudited pro forma combined condensed financial statements are
presented for illustrative purposes only and are not necessarily indicative of
the operating results or financial position that would have been achieved if
the acquisition had been consummated as of the beginning of the period
presented, nor are they necessarily indicative of the future operating results
or financial position of the combined company.

                          NOTES TO UNAUDITED PRO FORMA

                    COMBINED CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

(1) The unaudited pro forma combined per share amounts are based on the
    combined weighted-average number of Lionbridge common shares and Data
    Dimensions common shares outstanding for the period presented based on Data
    Dimensions stockholders receiving 0.190884 of a Lionbridge common share for
    each share of Data Dimensions common stock held.

(2) Certain reclassifications have been made to the Data Dimensions statement
    of operations and balance sheet to classify certain expenses and
    liabilities on a basis consistent with the Lionbridge presentation. None of
    the expense reclassifications affect loss from continuing operations.

(3) There were no financial transactions between Lionbridge and Data Dimensions
    during the period presented.

(4) Restructuring costs are anticipated to be incurred in connection with the
    acquisition of Data Dimensions. Such costs, which have not yet been
    estimated, may include amounts with respect to the elimination of excess
    facilities and employee severance. These costs have not been reflected in
    the unaudited pro forma combined condensed financial statements.

(5) Adjustments to reflect the acquisition of Data Dimensions as if it had
    occurred as of January 1, 2000 are as follows:

  a)  To remove depreciation expense of Data Dimensions due to the write down
      of property and equipment (see Note (6)(a)).

  b) To record amortization of the $2.2 million deferred credit generated
     from the acquisition of Data Dimensions, assuming one year of a five-
     year amortization period, recorded on a straight-line basis.

(6)  Adjustments to reflect the acquisition of Data Dimensions as if it had
     occurred as of December 31, 2000 are as follows:

  a) To allocate the excess of the fair value of assets and liabilities of
     Data Dimensions over the purchase price to the noncurrent assets of Data
     Dimensions, resulting in a residual deferred credit of $2.2 million. No
     amount of the excess has been allocated to the other long-term assets of
     Data Dimensions as these principally represent deferred taxes and cash
     deposits. The allocation of the purchase price to the fair value of
     assets and liabilities of Data Dimensions has not yet been determined.
     Therefore, for purposes of the unaudited pro forma combined condensed
     financial information, the excess of the book value of net assets
     acquired of Data Dimensions over the purchase price, after partial
     allocation to noncurrent assets, is being recorded as a deferred credit.

  b) To remove pre-acquisition stockholders' equity of Data Dimensions.

  c) To record issuance of 2,588,570 shares of Lionbridge common stock, the
     number of shares expected to be issued in the merger, at a value of
     $4.89 per share, the average closing price of Lionbridge common stock
     for five days before and after the announcement of the acquisition, as
     well as the fair value of the options and warrants to be assumed by
     Lionbridge for the purchase of approximately 450,000 shares of
     Lionbridge common stock, provisionally estimated to be $600,000.

  d) To record estimated merger transaction costs.

                       REPORT OF INDEPENDENT ACCOUNTANTS

To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of
Lionbridge Technologies, Inc.:

   In our opinion, based on our audits and the report of other auditors, the
accompanying consolidated balance sheets and the related consolidated
statements of operations, redeemable preferred stock and stockholders' equity
(deficit) and cash flows present fairly, in all material respects, the
financial position of Lionbridge Technologies, Inc. and its subsidiaries at
December 31, 2000 and 1999, and the results of their operations and their cash
flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2000 in
conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States
of America. These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's
management; our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial
statements based on our audits. We did not audit the financial statements of
INT'L.com, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary, as of December 31, 1999 and for
each of the two years in the period ended December 31, 1999, which statements
reflect total assets of $23,805,000 as of December 31, 1999 and total revenues
of $34,902,000 and $17,317,000 for each of the two years in the period ended
December 31, 1999. Those statements were audited by other auditors whose report
thereon has been furnished to us, and our opinion expressed herein, insofar as
it relates to the amounts included for INT'L.com, Inc., is based solely on the
report of the other auditors. We conducted our audits of these statements in
accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of
America, which require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable
assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the
accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and
evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our
audits and the report of other auditors provide a reasonable basis for our
opinion.

                    REPORT OF INDEPENDENT PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS

To the Board of Directors of
INT'L.com, Inc. and Subsidiaries:

   We have audited the consolidated balance sheet, as restated, of INT'L.com,
Inc. and Subsidiaries (a Delaware corporation formerly known as IC Global
Services, Inc.) as of December 31, 1999, and the related consolidated
statements of operations, redeemable preferred stock, stockholders' equity
(deficit) and comprehensive loss and cash flows for each of the two years in
the period ended December 31, 1999. These consolidated financial statements are
the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to
express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our
audits.

   We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally
accepted in the United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform
the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements
are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test
basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and
significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall
financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
reasonable basis for our opinion.

   In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above
present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of INT'L.com,
Inc. and Subsidiaries as of December 31, 1999, and the results of their
operations and their cash flows for each of the two years in the period ended
December 31, 1999, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted
in the United States.
