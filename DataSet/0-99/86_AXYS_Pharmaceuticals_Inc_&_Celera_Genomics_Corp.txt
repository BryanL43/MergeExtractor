Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Letterhead] 

Axys
Pharmaceuticals, Inc.

180 Kimball Way

South San Francisco, California 94080 

[           ],

Dear
Stockholder: 

    You
are cordially invited to attend our special meeting of stockholders on [            ], 2001, at 10:00 a.m., Pacific Time, at Axys'
headquarters located at 180 Kimball Way, South San Francisco, California 94080. 

    At
the special meeting, we will ask you to vote on the merger of Axys and Applera Corporation. In the merger, you will receive shares of Applera CorporationCelera
Genomics Group Common Stock (NYSE: CRA). Applera conducts its business through two groups: the Celera Genomics group and the Applied Biosystems group. The Celera Genomics common stock that you will
receive in the merger is a class of stock of Applera that is intended to reflect the relative performance of the Celera Genomics group. The exact number of shares of Celera Genomics common stock that
you will receive will be determined by an exchange ratio that is described in more detail in the enclosed proxy statement/prospectus. The exchange ratio is calculated based on the average closing
price of Celera Genomics common stock over the 10 trading days immediately preceding (but excluding) the second trading day prior to the closing of the merger. If the merger had closed at the time the
merger agreement was signed, for each of your shares of Axys common stock you would have received a fractional share of Celera Genomics common stock having an average closing price during the
calculation period equivalent to $4.65 per share of Axys common stock. We urge you to obtain current market quotations for Celera Genomics common stock and Axys common stock prior to making any
decision with respect to the merger. We expect that the merger will be tax-free to you for United States federal income tax purposes, except for cash received in place of fractional shares. 

    We
cannot complete the merger unless holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of Axys common stock vote for the approval and adoption of the merger agreement. Only stockholders
who hold shares of Axys common stock at the close of business on [            ], 2001 will be entitled to vote at the special meeting. 

The enclosed proxy statement/prospectus gives you detailed information about the proposed merger and includes the merger agreement as an annex. We encourage
you to read carefully the proxy
statement/prospectus, including its annexes. You should also consider the matters discussed under "Risk Factors" on page 22 of the accompanying proxy statement/prospectus before
voting.

After careful consideration, the Axys board of directors has unanimously approved the merger agreement, has unanimously determined that the merger is advisable
and fair to you and in your best interests and unanimously recommends that you vote "FOR" the approval and adoption of the merger agreement and the approval of the merger.

Your vote is very important. Whether or not you plan to attend the special meeting, please complete, sign and date the enclosed proxy card and return it in the
enclosed prepaid envelope. If you attend the special meeting, you may revoke your proxy and vote in person if you wish, even if you have previously returned your proxy card. Your prompt cooperation
will be greatly appreciated.

Sincerely,

QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS ABOUT THE MERGER    

Q:

What am I being asked to vote upon?

A:

You are being asked to vote to approve and adopt the merger agreement entered into between Axys and Applera and to approve the merger contemplated by the merger agreement. In the merger, a wholly owned subsidiary of Applera will be merged with and
into Axys. After the merger is completed, Axys, which will be the company surviving the merger, will be a wholly owned subsidiary of Applera. After the merger, the operations of Axys will be integrated into the research and development and business
operations of the Celera Genomics group of Applera, which is one of the two operating groups through which Applera conducts its business.

Q:

Why is Axys proposing to merge?

A:

Since its inception, Axys has been focused on developing a state-of-the-art drug discovery platform that integrates "best-of-breed" technologies in both high throughput screening as well as in structure-based drug design. Axys believes that the
effectiveness of this platform in bringing optimized leads to clinical development has been demonstrated in its partnerships with Merck, Bayer and Aventis. To more fully take advantage of the potential of these technologies as well as the expertise
of Axys' scientific teams, Axys has determined that it needs a source of new therapeutic targets. The delivery of potential targets for drug discovery has been at the core of the work of the Celera Genomics group in the human genome, and in its
future plans for proteomics. Axys believes that the integrated genomic, proteomic, bioinformatic and computing platforms of the Celera Genomics group can be expected to yield targets that can be evaluated and selected in an effort to develop
breakthrough drugs that work by interacting with the targets in novel ways. Hence, Axys believes that Axys and the Celera Genomics group have complementary strengths which are expected to enable the combined company to move forward more quickly and
effectively in the research and development of innovative small molecule therapeutics. In addition, holders of Axys common stock will have the opportunity to participate in a larger and better capitalized organization and to benefit from potential
appreciation in Celera Genomics common stock. For a more detailed discussion of why Axys is proposing to merge, see "The MergerBackground of the Merger" and "The MergerReasons of Axys for the Merger" in this proxy
statement/prospectus.

Q:

Why is the Axys board of directors recommending that I vote for adoption of the merger agreement?

A:

In reaching its decision to approve the merger agreement and the merger and to recommend approval and adoption of the merger agreement and approval of the merger by the Axys stockholders, the Axys board of directors consulted with Axys management, as
well as Axys' financial and legal advisors, and considered the terms of the merger agreement and the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement. In addition, the Axys board of directors unanimously approved the merger agreement and the merger,
and believes that the terms of the merger agreement and the merger are fair to, and in the best interests of, Axys and its stockholders.

Q:

What will I receive in the merger for my shares of Axys common stock?

A:

If the merger is completed, you will receive shares of Applera CorporationCelera Genomics Group Common Stock (NYSE: CRA) (which we refer to in this proxy statement/prospectus as Celera Genomics common stock) in exchange for your shares of Axys
common stock. Celera Genomics common stock is a "tracking stock" issued by Applera that is designed to reflect the performance of the business conducted by the Celera Genomics group.

The exact number of shares of Celera Genomics common stock that you will receive will be determined by an exchange ratio that will fluctuate with the market price of Celera Genomics common stock and be subject to a version of a mechanism commonly
referred to as a "collar" that reduces your exposure to losses and gains from market price fluctuation within certain market price ranges. The exchange ratio is calculated based on the average closing price of Celera Genomics common stock over the
10 trading days immediately preceding (but excluding) the second trading trading day prior to the closing of the merger. The actual number of shares of Celera Genomics common stock that you will receive in exchange for your shares of Axys common
stock will be calculated at the time of the closing of the merger. If the closing had occurred at the time the merger agreement was signed, for each of your shares of Axys common stock you would have received a fractional share of Celera Genomics
common stock having an average closing price during the calculation period equivalent to $4.65 per share of Axys common stock.

The exchange ratio will be determined at the time of the merger as follows:



if the 10-day average closing price of a share of Celera Genomics common stock immediately preceding (but excluding) the second trading day prior to the closing date of the merger is equal to or greater than $45.77 and less than or equal to $48.23,
the fraction will be 0.1016 shares, or $4.65 divided by $45.77, the 10-day average closing price of a share of Celera Genomics common stock immediately preceding (but excluding) the second trading day prior to the signing of the merger
agreement;



if the 10-day average closing price of a share of Celera Genomics common stock immediately preceding (but excluding) the second trading day prior to the closing date of the merger is greater than $48.23 and less than or equal to $60.29, the fraction
will be $4.90 divided by this 10-day average closing price;



if the 10-day average closing price of a share of Celera Genomics common stock immediately preceding (but excluding) the second trading day prior to the closing date of the merger is greater than $60.29, the fraction will be fixed at 0.0813
shares;



if the 10-day average closing price of a share of Celera Genomics common stock immediately preceding (but excluding) the second trading day prior to the closing date of the merger is less than $45.77 and greater than or equal to $34.33, the fraction
will be $4.65 divided by this 10-day average closing price; and



if the 10-day average closing price of a share of Celera Genomics common stock immediately preceding (but excluding) the second trading day prior to the closing date of the merger is less than $34.33, the fraction will be fixed at 0.1355
shares.

If the closing of the merger were to have occurred on [            ], 2001, each issued and outstanding share of Axys common stock would have been exchanged for
[      ] shares of Celera Genomics common stock. Therefore, if the closing of the merger were to have occurred on [            ], 2001, for each of your shares
of Axys common stock you would have received Celera Genomics common stock having an average closing price during the calculation period equivalent to $[      ] per share of Axys common stock, and the total consideration
paid to all holders of Axys common stock would have been Celera Genomics common stock with a total price of $[      ] million, based on its average closing price during the calculation period.

Q:

What is a "tracking stock"?

A:

Celera Genomics common stock is a "tracking stock" which is issued by Applera and is intended to reflect the relative performance of the Celera Genomics group. It is listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol "CRA." If the merger
is completed, the business of Axys will be conducted as part of the Celera Genomics group.

A "tracking stock" is a class of stock of a corporation designed to "track" the performance of a specific business within the larger corporation. Although holders of a "tracking stock" are equity holders of the larger corporation, "tracking stock" is
intended to reflect or "track" the performance of a group of assets or division within the larger corporation. Investors commonly refer to this type of common stock as "tracking stock," "targeted stock" or "letter stock."

Applera conducts its business through two operating groups: the Celera Genomics group and the Applied Biosystems group. Applera CorporationApplied Biosystems Group Common Stock (NYSE: ABI) (which we refer to in this proxy statement/prospectus
as Applied Biosystems common stock) is a "tracking stock" intended to reflect the relative performance of the Applied Biosystems group of Applera. The Applied Biosystems group and the Celera Genomics group are not separate legal entities, and holders
of these stocks are stockholders of a single company, Applera. This means that the assets Applera attributes to one group could be subject to the liabilities of the other group. Holders of Celera Genomics common stock will be subject to all of the
risks relating to an investment in Applera, including the Applied Biosystems group. For more information about "tracking stock," see "Risk FactorsRisks Related to a Capital Structure with Two Separate Classes of Common Stock" in this proxy
statement/prospectus.

Q:

Will I be able to sell the shares of Celera Genomics common stock I receive in the merger?

A:

Yes. All stockholders of Axys, other than those deemed to be affiliated or controlling stockholders, will generally be free to sell their shares of Celera Genomics common stock received in the merger. Affiliates of Axys will be able to sell their
shares of Celera Genomics common stock within the limits permitted by Rule 145 under the Securities Act.

Q:

What will happen to options to purchase shares of Axys common stock?

A:

Each option to purchase Axys common stock outstanding at the time of the merger will be assumed by Applera and converted into an option to purchase shares of Celera Genomics common stock. The option will be exercisable for a number of shares of
Celera Genomics common stock equal to the number of shares of Axys common stock subject to the option multiplied by the exchange ratio (rounded down to the nearest whole share) and the exercise price per share will equal the existing option exercise
price divided by the exchange ratio (rounded up to the nearest whole cent). However, in no event will the option exercise price for stock options held by Axys employees and consultants be higher than the closing price of a share of Celera Genomics
common stock on the date immediately prior to the closing of the merger.

Q:

What if the merger is not completed?

A:

If the merger is not completed, Axys will continue to operate as an independent company, and neither Applera nor Axys will be under any obligation to purchase your Axys common stock. Axys may be required to pay a termination fee if the merger is not
completed for certain reasons described under "The MergerTermination of the Merger AgreementTermination Fee" in this proxy statement/prospectus.

Q:

What are the tax consequences of the merger to stockholders?

A:

Holders of Axys common stock who exchange their shares of Axys common stock solely for shares of Celera Genomics common stock pursuant to the merger will not recognize any gain or loss on the exchange for United States federal income tax purposes,
except with respect to cash, if any, received instead of fractional share interests of Celera Genomics common stock. The merger will not have any tax consequences for Applera stockholders. To review the tax consequences to stockholders in greater
detail, see "Material United States Federal Income Tax Consequences" in this proxy statement/prospectus.

Q:

What tax basis will holders of Axys common stock have in the Celera Genomics common stock they receive in the merger?

A:

Your tax basis in your shares of Celera Genomics common stock will equal your current tax basis in your Axys common stock reduced by the amount of basis allocable to fractional shares for which you receive a cash payment.

Q:

Will Applera stockholders receive any shares as a result of the merger?

A:

No. Applera stockholders will continue to hold the Applera shares they currently own.

Q:

Does Applera currently own any shares of Axys common stock?

A:

No. Applera is not an Axys stockholder.

Q:

Where can I get information regarding Applera, Axys and the merger?

A:

We urge you to read and consider the information contained in this proxy statement/prospectus, including its annexes. You should also review the additional documents related to Applera referenced under "Where You Can Find More Information" in this
proxy statement/prospectus.

Q:

Who may vote at the special meeting?

A:

All Axys stockholders of record as of the close of business on [            ], 2001 may vote. You are entitled to one vote per share of Axys common stock that you own on the record
date.

Q:

How do I vote?

A:

After carefully reading and considering the information contained in, or incorporated by reference in, this proxy statement/prospectus, please complete and sign your proxy and return it in the enclosed return envelope as soon as possible so that your
shares may be represented at the special meeting. If you sign and send in your proxy and do not indicate how you want to vote, we will count your proxy as a vote in favor of approval and adoption of the merger agreement and approval of the merger. If
you abstain from voting or do not vote your shares by proxy or in person, it will have the same effect as a vote against approval and adoption of the merger agreement and approval of the merger.

The special meeting will be held at Axys' headquarters located at 180 Kimball Way, South San Francisco, California 94080 on [            ], 2001 at 10:00 a.m. Pacific Time. You may
attend the special meeting and vote your shares in person, rather than signing and mailing your proxy.

Q:

If my shares are held in a brokerage account or in "street name" by my broker, how do I vote?

A:

Your broker will vote your shares only if you provide instructions on how to vote. You should follow the directions provided by your broker on how to instruct your broker to vote your shares. If you do not instruct your broker, your shares will not
be voted, which will have the same effect as a vote against adoption of the merger agreement.

Q:

Can I change my vote after I have mailed my proxy card?

A:

Yes. You can change your vote at any time before your proxy is voted at Axys' special meeting. You can do this in one of three ways. First, you can send a written notice to the Secretary of Axys, William J. Newell, stating that you would like to
revoke your proxy. Second, you can complete and submit a new proxy card by following the instructions on the proxy card. Third, you can attend Axys' special meeting and vote in person.

Q:

301 Merritt 7

Norwalk, Connecticut 06851-1070

(203) 840-2000 

    Angel
Acquisition, a Delaware corporation, is a wholly owned subsidiary of Applera that was organized solely for purposes of completing the merger. 

The Special Meeting (see page 46)  

    The special meeting of stockholders of Axys will be held at 10:00 a.m. Pacific Time, on [            ], 2001, at Axys'
headquarters located at 180 Kimball Way, South San Francisco, California 94080. 

    At
the special meeting, we will ask the holders of shares of Axys common stock to: 


approve
and adopt the merger agreement and approve the merger; and


conduct
any other business properly brought before the meeting. 

Record Date; Stock Entitled to Vote (see page 46)  

    You can vote, or submit a proxy to vote, at the special meeting if you were a record holder of Axys common stock at the close of business on
[      ], 2001, the record date for determining which holders of Axys common stock are entitled to vote at the special meeting. At the record date, there were
[            ] shares of Axys common stock entitled to vote at the special meeting. 

    Holders
of Axys common stock as of the record date are entitled to one vote per share on each matter to be voted on at the special meeting. 

Quorum (see page 46)  

    For a quorum to exist and for the special meeting to proceed, a majority of the shares issued and outstanding and entitled to vote must be present in person or
represented by proxy. 

Vote Required (see page 46)  

    The merger will be approved only if the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of Axys common stock entitled to vote at the special meeting vote for
the proposal to approve and adopt the merger agreement and approve the merger. 

The Merger (see page 49)  

    The merger agreement contemplates that Angel Acquisition, a wholly owned subsidiary of Applera formed for the purpose of the merger, will merge with and into
Axys. As a result, Axys will become a wholly owned subsidiary of Applera. 

    We
have attached the merger agreement, which is the legal document that governs the merger, as Annex A to this proxy statement/prospectus. We encourage you to read the merger
agreement. 

Reasons of Axys for the Merger (see page 52)  

    Since its inception, Axys has been focused on developing a state-of-the-art drug discovery platform that integrates
"best-of-breed" technologies in both high throughput screening as well as in structure-based drug design. Axys believes that the effectiveness of this platform in
bringing optimized leads to clinical development has been demonstrated in its partnerships with Merck, Bayer and Aventis. To more fully take advantage of the potential of these technologies as well as
the expertise of Axys' scientific teams, Axys has determined that it needs a source of new therapeutic targets. The delivery of potential targets for drug discovery has been at the core of the work of
the Celera Genomics group in the human genome, and in its future plans for proteomics. Axys believes that the integrated genomic, proteomic, bioinformatic and computing platforms of the Celera
Genomics group can be expected to yield targets that can be evaluated and selected in an effort to develop breakthrough drugs that work by interacting with the targets in novel ways. Hence, Axys
believes that Axys and the Celera Genomics group have
complementary strengths which are expected to enable the combined company to move forward more quickly and effectively in the research and development of innovative small molecule therapeutics. In
addition, holders of Axys common stock will have the opportunity to participate in a larger and better capitalized organization and to benefit from potential appreciation in Celera Genomics common
stock. 

Recommendation of the Axys Board of Directors (see page 53)  

    The Axys board of directors has unanimously approved the merger agreement and the merger and has determined that the merger is advisable and fair to, and in
the best interests of, Axys and its stockholders. The board of directors of Axys unanimously recommends that holders of Axys common stock vote FOR the approval and adoption of the merger agreement and
the approval of the merger. 

Opinion of Financial Advisor to the Axys Board of Directors (see page 54)  

    In deciding to approve the merger, the board of directors of Axys considered an opinion dated as of June 12, 2001 from its financial advisor, JPMorgan
H&Q, a division of J.P. Morgan Securities Inc., that, as of the date of the opinion and subject to the assumptions and limitations in the opinion, the "exchange ratio" specified in the merger
agreement was fair, from a financial point of view, to the holders of Axys common stock. 

    This
opinion is attached as Annex B to this proxy statement/prospectus. We encourage you to read this opinion in its entirety. 

Terms of the Merger Agreement  

Conversion of Shares and Options (see page 60)  

    In the merger, each share of Axys common stock will be exchanged for a fraction of a share of Celera Genomics common stock as determined in accordance with the
merger agreement and as described in this proxy statement/prospectus. Holders will receive only whole shares of Celera Genomics common
stock, and will receive cash instead of fractional shares, as described in this proxy statement/prospectus under "The MergerFractional Shares." 

Conditions to the Completion of the Merger (see page 68)  

    Several conditions must be satisfied or waived before the merger will be completed. These include: 


the
approval of the merger and approval and adoption of the merger agreement by the Axys stockholders;


the
absence of any injunction, temporary restraining order, or other legal restraint that prohibits the merger;


the
absence of any suit or other proceeding by any government entity which seeks to prohibit the merger, limit Applera's ownership or operation of any
material portion of Axys, or impose limitations on the ability of Applera to exercise ownership rights of any shares of Axys as the surviving corporation after the merger;


the
receipt of regulatory approvals under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended, and other required regulatory
approvals and authorizations;


the
accuracy, in all material respects, of the representations and warranties of Applera and Axys in the merger agreement;


the
fulfillment of the obligations of Axys, Applera and Angel Acquisition under the merger agreement; and


receipt
of legal opinions from counsel to the effect that the merger will qualify as a tax-free reorganization under Section 368(a) of
the Internal Revenue Code. 

Non-Solicitation Covenant (see page 66)  

    Axys has agreed, subject to limited exceptions, not to initiate or engage in discussions with another party about a business combination with the other party
prior to the termination of the merger agreement. 

Termination (see page 69)  

    Applera and Axys may mutually agree to terminate the merger agreement at any time. In addition, either Applera or Axys may terminate the merger agreement if
specified events do or do not occur. These include: 


if
a court or government regulator permanently prohibits the merger;


if
the merger is not completed on or before December 31, 2001, other than as a result of the failure by the party proposing to terminate the merger
agreement to perform its obligations;


if
the holders of Axys common stock fail to approve and adopt the merger agreement and approve the merger at the special meeting; or 


if
the other party breaches its representations or agreements so that a closing condition would not be satisfied and the breach, if curable, remains
uncured 30 days following notice to the breaching party. 

    Applera
may also terminate the merger agreement if: 


the
Axys board of directors withdraws or modifies, in a manner adverse to Applera, its recommendation of the merger agreement and the merger, or approves
or recommends another acquisition proposal; or


the
Axys board of directors fails to recommend rejection of any tender offer or exchange offer for more than 15% of the outstanding shares of Axys common
stock. 

    The
merger agreement may also be terminated by Axys if the Axys board of directors concludes in good faith after consultation with outside legal counsel that in order to avoid
violating its fiduciary duties in connection with a proposal for an alternative transaction that meets certain standards, it must withdraw or modify its recommendation of the merger agreement and the
merger and it withdraws or modifies its recommendation. For more information with respect to Axys' ability to terminate the merger agreement because of the fiduciary duties of its board of directors,
see "The MergerTermination of the Merger Agreement" in this proxy statement/prospectus. 

    The
merger agreement will become void and have no effect upon its termination without any liability or obligation on the part of Applera, Angel Acquisition or Axys, except for any
termination fee that may become payable by Axys and provisions relating to matters such as confidentiality and non-solicitation of employees that will survive as expressly provided in the
merger agreement. However, no party will be relieved from liability for any breach of the merger agreement prior to its termination. 

Termination Fee (see page 70)  

    Axys will pay Applera a fee of $5.6 million and up to $900,000 in out-of-pocket expenses if the merger agreement is terminated
under circumstances including a withdrawal of or change in the recommendation of the Axys board of directors in a manner that is adverse to Applera or the completion of an alternative transaction that
was publicly announced prior to the termination of the merger agreement. These circumstances are described in detail in "The MergerTermination of the Merger
AgreementTermination Fee" in this proxy statement/prospectus. 

Regulatory Matters (see page 69)  

    Under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act, Axys and Applera cannot complete the merger until they have provided certain information and materials to the
United States Federal Trade Commission and the United States Department of Justice, and a required waiting period has expired or been terminated. On June 29, 2001, Applera and Axys filed the
requisite Pre-Merger Notification and Report Forms with the United States Federal Trade Commission and the United States Department of Justice. The waiting period under the
Hart-Scott-Rodino Act will terminate on July 30, 2001, unless prior to that time the United States Department of Justice or the United States Federal Trade Commission makes a
request for additional information or the waiting period is otherwise extended. 

Accounting Treatment (see page 74)  

    For accounting and financial reporting purposes, the merger will be treated as a purchase by Applera under generally accepted accounting principles. 

NYSE Listing (see page 69)  

    Applera will list the Celera Genomics common stock to be issued in the merger on the New York Stock Exchange. 

Material United States Federal Income Tax Consequences (see page 72)  

    We intend that the merger will qualify as a reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, for
United States federal income tax purposes and have conditioned the merger upon the receipt of legal opinions that the merger will so qualify. Assuming the merger qualifies as a reorganization, neither
Applera nor Axys, nor their respective stockholders, will recognize any gain or loss for United States federal income tax purposes as a result of the merger, except for tax that may be payable by
holders of Axys common stock because of cash received for fractional shares. 

Tax matters can be complicated, and the tax consequences of the merger to you will depend on your particular tax situation. You should consult your own tax
advisor to fully understand the tax consequences of the merger to you.

Interests of Axys' Officers and Directors in the Merger (see page 74)  

    When considering the recommendation of the Axys board of directors, you should be aware that certain Axys officers and directors have interests in the merger
that may be different from, or in addition to, your interests as stockholders. These interests exist in part because of rights they may have under Axys employment agreements and benefits plans. In
addition, the merger agreement requires that after completion of the merger Applera must cause Axys, as the company surviving the merger, to indemnify the directors and officers of Axys for events
occurring before the merger, including events that are related to the merger. 

Dissenters' Rights (See Page 79)  

    Under Delaware law, stockholders of Axys will not be entitled to exercise dissenters' appraisal rights in connection with the merger.

Selected Unaudited Pro Forma Consolidated Financial Information of Applera and Axys  

    The following selected unaudited pro forma consolidated financial information is derived from unaudited pro forma consolidated financial statements and the
notes thereto, which are included elsewhere in this proxy statement/prospectus and should be read in conjunction with those statements and related notes. See "Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed
Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements" in this proxy statement/prospectus. 

    The
unaudited pro forma consolidated balance sheet assumes that the merger took place on March 31, 2001 and combines Applera's March 31, 2001 unaudited consolidated
balance sheet with Axys' March 31, 2001 unaudited balance sheet. The unaudited pro forma consolidated statements of operations for the nine months ended March 31, 2001 and the year ended
June 30, 2000 give effect to the merger as if it occurred on July 1, 1999. Because Applera and Axys have two different fiscal years, and the combined company will adopt the fiscal year
of Applera, pro forma operating results are presented on a June 30 fiscal year basis. 

    The
unaudited pro forma consolidated financial information is presented for illustrative purposes only and is not necessarily indicative of the consolidated financial position or
results of operations of future periods or the results that actually would have been realized had the entities been a single entity during these periods.

Selected Unaudited Pro Forma Combined Financial Information of the Celera Genomics Group and Axys  

    The following selected unaudited pro forma combined financial information is derived from unaudited pro forma combined financial statements and the notes
thereto, which are included elsewhere in this proxy statement/prospectus and should be read in conjunction with those statements and related notes. See "Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Consolidated and
Combined Financial Statements." 

    The
unaudited pro forma combined balance sheet assumes that the merger took place on March 31, 2001 and combines the Celera Genomics group's March 31, 2001 unaudited
combined balance sheet with Axys' March 31, 2001 unaudited balance sheet. The unaudited pro forma combined statements of operations for the nine months ended March 31, 2001 and the year
ended June 30, 2000 give effect to the merger as if it occurred on July 1, 1999. Because the Celera Genomics group and Axys have two different fiscal years, and the combined company will
adopt the fiscal year end of the Celera Genomics group, pro forma operating results are presented on a June 30 fiscal year basis. 

    The
unaudited pro forma combined financial information is presented for illustrative purposes only and is not necessarily indicative of the combined financial position or results of

The
Axys per share equivalent pro forma information is calculated by multiplying the per share amounts for the Celera Genomics group by 0.1220, which is the exchange ratio that
would have been applied to the Axys common stock under the merger agreement had the merger occurred on July 9, 2001. If the merger had occurred on July 9, 2001, the average closing price
of Celera Genomics common stock during the calculation period that would have been used in the determination of the exchange ratio was $38.108. Provided below is a sensitivity analysis of the pro
forma per share information based on a 20% increase in the average closing price of Celera Genomics common stock during the calculation period, which would result in an exchange ratio of 0.1017, and a
20% decrease in the average closing price of Celera Genomics common stock during the calculation period, which would result in an exchange ratio of 0.1355.

Given

COMPARATIVE PER SHARE MARKET PRICE AND DIVIDEND INFORMATION    

    Celera Genomics common stock is listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol: "CRA". 

    The
following table sets forth the range of high and low sale prices of Celera Genomics common stock as reported by the New York Stock Exchange Composite Tape since May 6,
1999. On May 6, 1999, Applera recapitalized and issued two new classes of stock, the Celera Genomics common stock and the Applied Biosystems common stock, to the stockholders of Applera's
predecessor. Effective November 30, 2000, Applera, which was named "PE Corporation" at the time of the recapitalization, was renamed "Applera Corporation," and the Applied Biosystems group,
which was named the "PE Biosystems" group at the time of the recapitalization, was renamed the "Applied Biosystems" group. Therefore, neither the Celera Genomics common stock nor the Applied
Biosystems common stock was issued or outstanding at any time prior to May 6, 1999. The table gives effect to the two-for-one stock split of Celera Genomics common stock
effected in the form of a 100% stock dividend distributed on February 18, 2000. Applera has not paid any cash dividends with respect to Celera Genomics common stock and does not anticipate
paying any cash dividends on Celera Genomics common stock in the foreseeable future.

    The
actual equivalent per share price of a share of Axys common stock that holders of Axys common stock will receive if the merger is completed may increase or decrease from that
noted in the table above due to continuous fluctuations in the per share price of Celera Genomics common stock on the New York Stock Exchange and application of the applicable exchange ratio as
further discussed in this proxy statement/prospectus under "The MergerConsideration to be Received in the Merger". 

We urge Axys stockholders to obtain current market quotations for Celera Genomics common stock and Axys common stock prior to making any decision with respect
to the merger. We cannot give any assurance as to the future prices or markets for Celera Genomics common stock.
 Following the merger, Celera Genomics common stock will
continue to be traded on the New York Stock Exchange, and there will be no further market for Axys common stock. 

RISK FACTORS    

    By voting in favor of approving and adopting the merger agreement and approving the merger, you will be choosing to invest in Celera Genomics common stock. You
should carefully consider the following factors, in addition to those factors discussed in the documents that Applera has filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission that we have incorporated by
reference into this document, and the other information included in this proxy statement/prospectus, before voting on the proposal to approve and adopt the merger agreement and the merger. 

Risks Related to the Merger  

The number of shares of Celera Genomics common stock to be received in the merger by holders of Axys common stock may vary due to the formula for calculating the exchange
ratio.  

    In the merger, each share of Axys common stock will be converted into the right to receive a number of shares of Celera Genomics common stock equal to the
exchange ratio. The exchange ratio, or the number of shares of Celera Genomics common stock into which each share of Axys common stock will be converted, will fluctuate, within specified limits,
depending upon the 10-day average closing price of a share of Celera Genomics common stock immediately preceding (but excluding) the second trading day prior to the closing date of the
merger. See "The MergerConsideration to be Received in the Merger" in this proxy statement/prospectus for a discussion of the determination of the exchange ratio. In addition, the
volatility of the market price of Celera Genomics common stock directly affects the exchange ratio calculation, as described in this proxy statement/prospectus. See "SummaryComparative
Per Share Market Price and Dividend Information" in this proxy statement/prospectus for more detailed Celera Genomics common stock share price information. Variations in the Celera Genomics common
stock share price may be the result of various factors including: 


changes
in the business, operations or prospects of the Celera Genomics group;


changes
in the business, operations or prospects of Applera (including the Applied Biosystems group);


general
market and economic conditions; and


other
factors described under "Risks Related to the Celera Genomics GroupCelera Genomics Common Stock Price is Highly Volatile"
in this proxy statement/prospectus. 

    At
the time of the special meeting, holders of Axys common stock will not necessarily know the exact number or the exact market price of the Celera Genomics common stock that will be
issued in connection with the merger. The number of shares that will be received for each share of Axys common stock will be calculated using the exchange ratio described in this proxy
statement/prospectus, and will vary accordingly based on the trading price of Celera Genomics common stock after the special stockholders meeting. Stockholders of Axys are urged to obtain current
market quotations for Celera Genomics common stock prior to the date of the special stockholders meeting. 

The requirement for regulatory approvals may delay consummation of the merger.  

    Consummation of the merger is conditioned upon the receipt of all material governmental authorizations, consents, orders and approvals, including the
expiration or termination of the applicable waiting periods, and any extension of the waiting periods, under antitrust laws. Applera and Axys intend to vigorously pursue all required regulatory
approvals. No assurance can be given, however, that these approvals will be obtained, or, if they are obtained, as to the terms, conditions and timing of these approvals. The requirement for these
approvals could delay the consummation of the merger after holders of Axys common stock have approved the proposals relating to the merger at the special meeting. See "The
MergerConditions to the Merger" in this proxy statement/prospectus for a 

discussion of the conditions to the consummation of the merger and "The MergerRegulatory Approvals Required" in this proxy statement/prospectus for a description of the regulatory
approvals necessary in connection with the merger. 

The interests of management may be different from those of Axys stockholders.  

    Some members of Axys' management and board of directors have various interests in the merger that may be different from, or in addition to, the interests of
holders of Axys common stock. These interests include agreements with Axys that may entitle members of Axys management and board of directors to receive severance or termination pay or to accelerated
stock option vesting upon completion of the merger. See "The MergerInterests of Certain Persons in the Merger" in this proxy statement/prospectus
for more information concerning matters relating to the employment and compensation of the directors and executive officers of Axys. 

The Celera Genomics group may encounter difficulties in the integration and development of the business of Axys and in attracting and retaining employees of Axys.  

    The Celera Genomics group's strategy to integrate and develop the combined businesses of the Celera Genomics group and Axys following the merger involves a
number of elements that management may not be able to implement as expected. For example, the Celera Genomics group may encounter operational difficulties in the integration of facilities and
employees of the two companies. In addition, the Celera Genomics group's expansion into the drug discovery area as a result of the integration of the capabilities of the Celera Genomics group and Axys
may not be achieved as successfully or as rapidly as currently anticipated, if at all, and may require the acquisition or development of additional technologies and capabilities. The consolidation of
operations and scientific teams presents significant managerial challenges. There can be no assurance that these actions will be accomplished as successfully or as rapidly as currently anticipated, if
at all. There can also be no assurance that the employees of Axys will be willing to continue their employment with Axys after the merger. In addition, some of Axys' collaboration and other agreements
contain provisions that might permit the other party to the contract to terminate certain aspects of the contractual relationship relating to research and development if the merger takes place. There
is no assurance that the parties to these contracts with Axys will not seek to exercise these termination rights, or that the Celera Genomics group will be able to maintain all of Axys' existing
commercial relationships after the merger. 

Risks Related to the Celera Genomics Group  

The Celera Genomics group has incurred net losses to date and may not achieve profitability.  

    The Celera Genomics group has accumulated net losses of $263.3 million as of March 31, 2001, and expects that it will continue to incur
additional net losses for the foreseeable future. These losses may increase as the Celera Genomics group expands its investments in new technology and product development, including the development of
its functional genomics and personalized health/medicine and drug discovery and development efforts. As an early stage business, the Celera Genomics group faces significant challenges in
simultaneously expanding its operations, pursuing key scientific goals and attracting customers for its information products and services. As a result, there is a high degree of uncertainty that the
Celera Genomics group will be able to achieve profitable operations. 

The Celera Genomics group's business plan is unique and expanding.  

    No organization has ever attempted to combine in one business organization all of the Celera Genomics group's businesses. In addition, as the Celera Genomics
group moves beyond the genome database business, it is expanding its business plan to provide new scientific capabilities and services to 

customers in areas such as functional genomics, personalized health/medicine, proteomics, and drug discovery and development. The offering of genomics databases, functional genomics, proteomics,
personalized health/medicine capabilities and drug discovery and development targeted at a wide variety of customers, from pharmaceutical companies to university researchers, has a number of risks,
including pricing and volume issues, technology and access concerns, computer security, pursuit of key scientific goals and protection of intellectual property. The addition of the functional
genomics, personalized health/medicine, proteomics, and drug discovery and development efforts will add further complexity and require additional management attention and resources as these new
markets are addressed. 

The Celera Genomics group's business plan depends heavily on continued assembly and annotation of the human and mouse genomes.  

    The Celera Genomics group will continue to update its assembly of the human and mouse genome as it continues to annotate these genomes. The Celera Genomics
group's ability to retain its existing customers and attract new customers for its genome database business is heavily dependent upon the continued assembly and annotation of these genomes. Also, this
information is essential to the functional genomics, personalized health/medicine and drug discovery and development components of the Celera Genomics group's business strategy in which the Celera
Genomics group intends to make substantial investments in the near future. As a result, failure to update the assembly and annotation efforts in a timely manner may have a material adverse effect on
the Celera Genomics group's business. 

The Celera Genomics group's revenue growth depends on retaining existing customers and adding new customers.  

    The Celera Genomics group reported approximately 40 customers at the close of the March 31, 2001 quarter, the revenues from which will offset only a
small portion of its expenses. In order to generate significant additional revenues, the Celera Genomics group must obtain additional customers and retain its existing customers. The Celera Genomics
group's ability to retain existing customers and add new customers depends upon customers' continued belief that the Celera Genomics group's products can help accelerate their drug discovery and
development efforts and fundamental discoveries in biology. Although customer agreements typically have multiple year terms, there can be no assurance that any
will be renewed upon expiration. The Celera Genomics group's future revenues are also affected by the extent to which existing customers expand their agreements to include new services and database
products. In some cases, the Celera Genomics group may accept milestone payments or future royalties on products developed by its customers as consideration for access to the Celera Genomics group's
databases and products in lieu of a portion of subscription fees. Such arrangements are unlikely to produce revenue for the Celera Genomics group for a number of years, if ever, and depend heavily on
the research and product development, sales and marketing and intellectual property protection abilities of the customer. 

Use of genomics information to develop or commercialize products is unproven.  

    The development of new drugs and the diagnosis of disease based on genomic information is unproven. Few therapeutic or diagnostic products based on genomic
discoveries have been developed and commercialized and to date no one has developed or commercialized any therapeutic, diagnostic or agricultural products based on the Celera Genomics group's
technologies. If the Celera Genomics group or its customers are unsuccessful in developing and commercializing products based on the group's databases or other products or services, customers and the
group may be unable to generate sufficient revenues and the Celera Genomics group's business may suffer as a result. Development of these products will be subject to risks of failure, including that
these products will be found to be toxic, 

be found to be ineffective, fail to receive regulatory approvals, fail to be developed prior to the successful marketing of similar products by competitors or infringe on proprietary rights of third
parties. 

The industry in which the Celera Genomics group operates is intensely competitive and evolving.  

    There is intense competition among entities attempting to interpret segments of the human genome and identify genes associated with specific diseases and
develop products, services and intellectual property based on these discoveries. The Celera Genomics group faces competition in these areas from genomic, pharmaceutical, biotechnology and diagnostic
companies, academic and research institutions and government or other publicly-funded agencies, both in the United States and abroad. A number of companies, other institutions and government-financed
entities are engaged in gene sequencing, gene discovery, gene expression analysis, positional cloning, the study of genetic variation, functional genomics and other genomic service businesses. Some of
these competitors are developing databases containing gene sequence, gene-expression, genetic variation or other biological information and are marketing or plan to market their data to
pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies and academic and research institutions. Additional competitors may attempt to establish databases containing this information in the future. The Celera
Genomics group has licensed some of its key technology on a non-exclusive basis from third parties and therefore this technology may be available for license by competitors of the Celera
Genomics group. 

    Competitors
may also discover, characterize or develop important genes, drug targets or leads, drug discovery technologies, or drugs in advance of the Celera Genomics group or its
customers, or which are more effective than those developed by the Celera Genomics group or its customers, or may obtain regulatory approvals of their drugs more rapidly than the Celera Genomics group
or its customers do, any of which could have a material adverse effect on any of the similar programs of the Celera Genomics group or its customers. Moreover, these competitors may obtain patent
protection or other intellectual property rights that would limit the Celera Genomics group's rights or its customers' ability to use the Celera Genomics group's products to commercialize therapeutic,
diagnostic or agricultural products. In addition, a customer may use the Celera Genomics group's services to develop products that compete with products separately developed by the group or its other
customers. 

    Future
competition will come from existing competitors as well as other companies seeking to develop new technologies for drug discovery, drug development, and diagnostics based on
gene sequencing, target gene identification, bioinformatics and related technologies. In addition, certain pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies have significant needs for genomic information and
may choose to develop or acquire competing technologies to meet those needs. The Celera Genomics group also faces competition from providers of software. A number of companies have announced their
intent to develop and market software to assist pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies and academic researchers in managing and analyzing their own genomic data and publicly available data. 

The Celera Genomics group's current and potential customers are primarily from, and are subject to risks faced by, the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries.  

    The Celera Genomics group derives a substantial portion of its revenues from fees for its information products and services paid by pharmaceutical companies
and larger biotechnology companies, including Amgen Inc., Novartis Pharma AG, Pharmacia & Upjohn, Pfizer Inc., Takeda Chemical Industries, Ltd., American Home Products
Corporation, Immunex Corporation and Yamanouchi Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd.. The Celera Genomics group expects that pharmaceutical companies and larger biotechnology companies will continue to be
the Celera Genomics group's primary source of revenues for the foreseeable future. As a result, the Celera Genomics group is subject to risks and uncertainties that affect the pharmaceutical and
biotechnology industries and to reduction and delays in research and development expenditures by companies in these industries. 

    In addition, the Celera Genomics group's future revenues may be adversely affected by mergers and consolidation in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries, which will reduce
the number of the group's potential customers. Large pharmaceutical and biotechnology customers could also decide to conduct their own genomics programs or seek other providers instead of using the
Celera Genomics group's products and services. 

The Celera Genomics group relies on its strategic relationship with the Applied Biosystems group.  

    The Celera Genomics group believes that its strategic relationship with the Applied Biosystems group has provided it with a significant competitive advantage
in its efforts to date to sequence the human and other genomes. The Celera Genomics group's timely completion of that work and successful extension of its business into the functional genomics,
personalized health/medicine and proteomics arenas will depend on the Applied Biosystems group's ability to continue to provide leading edge, proprietary technology and products, including
technologies relating to genetic analysis, protein analysis and high throughput screening. If the Applied Biosystems group is unable to supply these technologies, the Celera Genomics group will need
to obtain access to alternative technologies, which may not be available, or may only be available on unfavorable terms. Any change in the relationship with the Applied Biosystems group that adversely
affects the Celera Genomics group's access to the Applied Biosystems group's technology or failure by the Applied Biosystems group to continue to develop new technologies or protect its proprietary
technology could adversely affect the Celera Genomics group's business. 

Introduction of new products may expose the Celera Genomics group to product liability claims.  

    New products developed by the Celera Genomics group could expose the Celera Genomics group to potential product liability risks that are inherent in the
testing, manufacturing and marketing of human therapeutic and diagnostic products. Product liability claims or product recalls, regardless of the ultimate outcome, could require the Celera Genomics
group to spend significant time and money in litigation and to pay significant damages. 

The Celera Genomics group could incur liabilities relating to hazardous materials that it uses in its research and development activities.  

    The Celera Genomics group's research and development activities involve the controlled use of hazardous materials, chemicals and various radioactive materials.
In the event of an accidental contamination or injury from these materials, the Celera Genomics group could be held liable for damages in excess of its resources. 

The Celera Genomics group's sales cycle is lengthy and it may spend considerable resources on unsuccessful sales efforts or may not be able to complete deals on the schedule
anticipated.  

    The Celera Genomics group's sales cycle is typically lengthy because the group needs to educate potential customers and sell the benefits of its products and
services to a variety of constituencies within those companies. In addition, each agreement involves the negotiation of unique terms. The
Celera Genomics group's ability to obtain new customers for genomic information products, value-added services, and licenses to intellectual property depends on its customers' belief that the Celera
Genomics group can help accelerate their drug discovery efforts. The Celera Genomics group may expend substantial funds and management effort with no assurance that an agreement will be reached with a
potential customer. Actual and proposed consolidations of pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies have affected and may in the future affect the timing and progress of the Celera Genomics group's
sales efforts. 

Scientific and management staff have unique expertise which is key to the Celera Genomics group's commercial viability and which would be difficult to replace.  

    The Celera Genomics group is highly dependent on the principal members of its scientific and management staff, particularly J. Craig Venter, its President and
Chief Scientific Officer. Additional members of the Celera Genomics group's medical, scientific and bioinformatics staff are important to the development of information, tools and services required
for implementation of its business plan. The loss of any of these persons' expertise would be difficult to replace and could have a material adverse effect on the Celera Genomics group's ability to
achieve its goals. 

The Celera Genomics group's competitive position may depend on patent and copyright protection, which may not be sufficiently available.  

    The Celera Genomics group's ability to compete and to achieve profitability may be affected by its ability to protect its proprietary technology and other
intellectual property. While the Celera Genomics group's business is currently primarily dependent on revenues from access fees to its discovery and information system, the Celera Genomics group
expects that obtaining patent protection may become increasingly important to its business as it moves beyond the genome database business. The Celera Genomics group would be able to prevent
competitors from making, using or selling any of its technology for which it obtains a patent. However, patent law affecting the Celera Genomics group's business, particularly gene sequences, gene
function and polymorphisms, is uncertain, and as a result, the Celera Genomics group is uncertain as to its ability to obtain intellectual property protection covering its information discoveries
sufficient to prevent competitors from developing similar subject matter. Patents may not issue from patent applications that the Celera Genomics group may own or license. In addition, because patent
applications in the United States are maintained in secrecy until patents issue, third parties may have filed patent applications for technology used by the Celera Genomics group or covered by the
Celera Genomics group's pending patent applications without the Celera Genomics group being aware of those applications. 

    Moreover,
the Celera Genomics group may be dependent on protecting, through copyright law or otherwise, its databases to prevent other organizations from taking information from those
databases
and copying and reselling it. Copyright law currently provides uncertain protection regarding the copying and resale of factual data. As such, the Celera Genomics group is uncertain whether it could
prevent that copying or resale. Changes in copyright and patent law could either expand or reduce the extent to which the Celera Genomics group and its customers are able to protect their intellectual
property. 

The Celera Genomics group's position may depend on its ability to protect trade secrets.  

    The Celera Genomics group relies on trade secret protection for its confidential and proprietary information and procedures, including procedures related to
sequencing genes and to searching and identifying important regions of genetic information. The Celera Genomics group currently protects its information and procedures as trade secrets. The Celera
Genomics group protects its trade secrets through recognized practices, including access control, confidentiality and nonuse agreements with employees, consultants, collaborators, and customers, and
other security measures. These confidentiality and nonuse agreements may be breached, however, and the Celera Genomics group may not have adequate remedies for a breach. In addition, the Celera
Genomics group's trade secrets may otherwise become known or be independently developed by competitors. 

Public disclosure of genomics sequence data could jeopardize the Celera Genomics group's intellectual property protection and have an adverse effect on the value of its
products and services.  

    The Celera Genomics group, the federally funded Human Genome Project and others engaged in similar research have made and are expected to continue making
available to the public basic human sequence data. Such disclosures might limit the scope of the Celera Genomics group's claims or make subsequent discoveries related to full-length genes
unpatentable. While the Celera Genomics group believes that the publication of sequence data will not preclude it or others from being granted patent protection on genes, there can be no assurance
that the publication has not affected and will not affect the ability to obtain patent protection. Customers may conclude that uncertainties of that protection decrease the value of the Celera
Genomics group's information products and services and as a result, it may be required to reduce the fees it charges for its products and services. 

The Celera Genomics group may infringe the intellectual property rights of third parties and may become involved in expensive intellectual property litigation.  

    The intellectual property rights of biotechnology companies, including the Celera Genomics group, are generally uncertain and involve complex legal, scientific
and factual questions. The Celera Genomics group's success in the functional genomics and drug discovery and development fields may depend, in
part, on its ability to operate without infringing on the intellectual property rights of others and to prevent others from infringing on its intellectual property rights. 

    There
has been substantial litigation regarding patents and other intellectual property rights in the genomics industry. The Celera Genomics group may become a party to patent
litigation or proceedings at the United States Patent and Trademark Office to determine its patent rights with respect to third parties, which may include subscribers to the Celera Genomics group's
database information services. Interference proceedings may be necessary to establish which party was the first to discover the intellectual property. The Celera Genomics group may become involved in
patent litigation against third parties to enforce the Celera Genomics group's patent rights, to invalidate patents held by the third parties, or to defend against these claims. The cost to the Celera
Genomics group of any patent litigation or similar proceeding could be substantial, and it may absorb significant management time. If an infringement litigation against the Celera Genomics group is
resolved unfavorably to the Celera Genomics group, the Celera Genomics group may be enjoined from manufacturing or selling certain of its products or services without a license from a third party. The
Celera Genomics group may not be able to obtain a license on commercially acceptable terms, or at all. 

    The
United States Patent and Trademark Office has issued several patents to third parties relating to single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). If other important SNPs receive patents,
the Celera Genomics group will need to obtain rights to those important SNPs in order to develop, use and sell related assays. Such licenses may not be available to the Celera Genomics group on
commercially acceptable terms, or at all. 

The Celera Genomics group's business is dependent on the continuous, effective, reliable and secure operation of its computer hardware, software and internet applications and
related tools and functions.  

    Because the Celera Genomics group's business requires manipulating and analyzing large amounts of data, and communicating the results of the analysis to its
internal research personnel and to its customers via the Internet, the Celera Genomics group depends on the continuous, effective, reliable and secure operation of its computer hardware, software,
networks, Internet servers and related infrastructure. To the extent that the Celera Genomics group's hardware or software malfunctions and access to the Celera Genomics group's data by the Celera
Genomics group's internal research personnel or customers through the Internet is interrupted, its business could suffer. The Celera 

Genomics group's computer and communications hardware is protected through physical and software safeguards. However, it is still vulnerable to fire, storm, flood, power loss, earthquakes,
telecommunications failures, physical or software break-ins and similar events. In addition, the Celera Genomics group's database products are complex and sophisticated, and as such, could
contain data, design or software errors that could be difficult to detect and correct. Software defects could be found in current or future products. If the Celera Genomics group fails to maintain and
further develop the
necessary computer capacity and data to support its computational needs and its customers' drug discovery efforts, it could result in loss of or delay in revenues and market acceptance. In addition,
any sustained disruption in Internet access provided by third parties could adversely impact the Celera Genomics group's business. 

The Celera Genomics group's research and product development depends on access to tissue samples and other biological materials.  

    The Celera Genomics group will need access to normal and diseased human and other tissue samples, other biological materials and related clinical and other
information, which may be in limited supply. The Celera Genomics group may not be able to obtain or maintain access to these materials and information on acceptable terms. In addition, government
regulation in the United States and foreign countries could result in restricted access to, or use of, human and other tissue samples. If the Celera Genomics group loses access to sufficient numbers
or sources of tissue samples, or if tighter restrictions are imposed on its use of the information generated from tissue samples, its business may be harmed. 

Ethical, legal and social issues related to the use of genetic information and genetic testing may cause less demand for the Celera Genomics group's products.  

    Genetic testing has raised issues regarding confidentiality and the appropriate uses of the resulting information. For example, concerns have been expressed
towards insurance carriers and employers using these tests to discriminate on the basis of this information, resulting in barriers to the acceptance of these tests by consumers. This could lead to
governmental authorities calling for limits on or regulation of the use of genetic testing or prohibit testing for genetic predisposition to certain diseases, particularly those that have no known
cure. Any of these scenarios could reduce the potential markets for products of the Celera Genomics group. 

Expected rapid growth in the number of its employees could absorb valuable management resources and be disruptive to the development of the Celera Genomics group's business.  

    The Celera Genomics group expects to increase its employee base significantly, including the addition of Axys' employees. This growth will require substantial
effort to hire new employees and train and integrate them in the Celera Genomics group's business and to develop and implement management information systems, financial controls and facility plans.
The Celera Genomics group's inability to manage growth effectively would have a material adverse effect on its future operating results. 

The use of the Celera Genomics group's products and services may be subject to government regulation.  

    The use of the Celera Genomics group's products by the Celera Genomics group and by pharmaceutical and biotechnology customers may be subject to certain United
States Food and Drug Administration or other regulatory approvals. For example, any new drug developed as a result of the use of the Celera Genomics group's databases must undergo an extensive
regulatory review process. This process can take many years and require substantial expense. Within the field of personalized health/medicine, current and future patient privacy and health care laws
and regulations issued by the United States Food and Drug Administration may limit the use of polymorphism data. 

    To the extent that use of the Celera Genomics group's databases is limited or additional costs are imposed on the Celera Genomics group or its customers due to regulation, the Celera
Genomics group's business may be adversely affected. 

    Furthermore,
the Celera Genomics group may be directly subject to regulations as a provider of diagnostic information. To the extent that these regulations restrict the sale of the
Celera Genomics group's products or impose other costs, the Celera Genomics group's business may be materially adversely affected. 

Future acquisitions may absorb significant resources and may be unsuccessful.  

    As part of the Celera Genomics group's strategy, it expects to pursue acquisitions (in addition to the Axys acquisition), investments and other strategic
relationships and alliances. Acquisitions, investments and other strategic relationships and alliances may involve significant cash expenditures, debt incurrence, additional operating losses, dilutive
issuances of equity securities, and expenses that could have a material effect on the Celera Genomics group's financial condition and results of operations. For example, to the extent that it elects
to pay the purchase price for acquisitions in shares of Celera Genomics common stock, the issuance of additional shares of Celera Genomics common stock may be dilutive to holders of Celera Genomics
common stock. Acquisitions involve numerous other risks, including: 


difficulties
integrating acquired technologies and personnel into the business of the Celera Genomics group;


diversion
of management from daily operations;


inability
to obtain required financing on favorable terms;


entry
into new markets in which the Celera Genomics group has little previous experience;


potential
loss of key employees or customers of acquired companies; and


assumption
of the liabilities and exposure to unforeseen liabilities of acquired companies. 

    It
may be difficult for the Celera Genomics group to complete these transactions quickly and to integrate these businesses efficiently into its current business. Any acquisitions,
investments or other strategic relationships and alliances by the Celera Genomics group may ultimately have a negative impact on its business and financial condition. 

Celera Genomics common stock price is highly volatile.  

    The market price of Celera Genomics common stock has been and may continue to be highly volatile due to the risks and uncertainties described in this section
of this proxy statement/prospectus, as well as other factors, including: 


conditions
and publicity regarding the genomics or life sciences industries generally;


price
and volume fluctuations in the stock market at large which do not relate to the Celera Genomics group's operating performance; and


comments
by securities analysts, or the Celera Genomics group's failure to meet market expectations. 

    The
stock market has from time to time experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that are unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies. In the past,
companies that have experienced volatility have sometimes been the subject of securities class action litigation. If litigation was instituted on this basis, it could result in substantial costs and a
diversion of management's attention and resources. 

Applera is subject to a purported class action lawsuit relating to its 2000 offering of shares of Celera Genomics common stock that may be expensive and time consuming.  

    Applera and certain of its officers have been served in five lawsuits purportedly on behalf of purchasers of Celera Genomics common stock in Applera's
follow-on public offering of Celera Genomics common stock completed on March 6, 2000. In the offering, Applera sold an aggregate of approximately 4.4 million shares of Celera
Genomics common stock at a public offering price of $225 per share. The complaints in these lawsuits generally allege that the prospectus used in connection with the offering contained inaccurate and
misleading statements in violation of federal securities laws. The complaints seek unspecified damages, rescission, costs and expenses, and other relief as the court deems proper. All of these
lawsuits have been consolidated into a single case. Although Applera believes the asserted claims are without merit and intends to defend the case vigorously, the outcome of this or any other
litigation is inherently uncertain. The defense of this case will require management attention and resources. 

The Celera Genomics group's ability to develop proprietary therapeutics and the Celera Genomics/Applied Biosystems Joint Venture's ability to develop proprietary molecular
diagnostic products is unproven.  

    The development and commercialization of new drugs based on genomic and proteomic information is unproven. As the Celera Genomics group expands its efforts
into this new business area, it faces the difficulties inherent in developing and commercializing therapeutic products, and it has limited experience in operating a commercial research and development
program. In addition, Applera has announced the formation of a major initiative in the field of molecular diagnostics and has decided that it will be optimally positioned as a joint venture between
the Applied Biosystems group and the Celera Genomics group. The joint venture faces the difficulties inherent in developing and commercializing diagnostic tests and in building and operating a
commercial research and development program. Given the Celera Genomics group's unproven ability to develop proprietary therapeutics and the joint venture's unproven ability to develop proprietary
molecular diagnostic products, it is possible that the Celera Genomics group's and the joint venture's discovery processes will not result in any commercial products or services. Even if the group or
the joint venture is able to develop products and services, it is possible that these products and services may not be commercially viable or successful due to a variety of reasons, including
difficulty obtaining regulatory approvals, competitive conditions, the inability to obtain necessary intellectual property protection, the need to build distribution channels, failure to get adequate
reimbursement for these products from insurance or government payors, or the inability of the group or the joint venture to recover its development costs in a reasonable period. 

Risks Related to a Capital Structure with Two Separate Classes of Common Stock  

You will be stockholders of Applera and, therefore, financial effects on either the Celera Genomics group or the Applied Biosystems group could adversely affect the other.  

    The Celera Genomics group and the Applied Biosystems group are not separate legal entities. As a result, stockholders will continue to be subject to all of the
risks of an investment in Applera, including the Applied Biosystems group. The risks and uncertainties that may affect the operations, performance, development, and results of the Applied Biosystems
group's businesses include but are not limited to rapidly changing technology and dependence on new products, dependence of sales on customers' capital spending policies and government-sponsored
research, claims for patent infringement, significant overseas operations, integration of acquired technologies as part of future growth strategy, electricity shortages and earthquakes. The assets
attributed to the Celera Genomics group could be subject to the liabilities of the Applied Biosystems group, even if these liabilities arise from lawsuits, contracts or indebtedness that are
attributed to the Applied Biosystems group. If Applera is unable to satisfy the Applied Biosystems group's liabilities out of the assets attributed to 

that group, Applera may be required to satisfy those liabilities with assets attributed to the Celera Genomics group. 

    Financial
effects from the Applied Biosystems group that affect Applera's consolidated results of operations or financial condition could, if significant, affect the results of
operations or financial condition of the Celera Genomics group and the market price of Celera Genomics common stock. In addition, net losses of the Applied Biosystems group and dividends or
distributions on, or repurchases of, Applied Biosystems common stock or repurchases of certain preferred stock will reduce the funds Applera can pay as dividends on Celera Genomics common stock under
Delaware law. For these reasons, you should read Applera's consolidated financial information with the financial information it provides for each group. 

Holders of Celera Genomics common stock will have limited rights related to the Celera Genomics group.  

    Holders of Celera Genomics common stock have only the rights customarily held by common stockholders. They will have only the following rights related to the
Celera Genomics group: 


certain
rights with regard to dividends and liquidation;


requirements,
subject to a number of exceptions, for a mandatory dividend, redemption or conversion upon the disposition of all or substantially all of the
assets of the Celera Genomics group; and


a
right to vote on matters as a separate voting class in the limited circumstances provided under Delaware law, by stock exchange rules or as determined by
Applera's board of directors. 

    Applera
will not hold separate meetings for holders of Celera Genomics common stock and Applied Biosystems common stock. 

Limits exist on the voting power of group common stock.  


Celera Genomics common stock may not have any influence on the outcome of stockholder
voting.
 Applied Biosystems common stock currently has a substantial majority of the voting power of the common stock of Applera. Except in limited circumstances
where there is separate class voting, either class of common stock that is entitled to more than the number of votes required to approve any stockholder action could control the outcome of the vote
even if the matter involves a divergence or conflict of the interests of the holders of Celera Genomics common stock and Applied Biosystems common stock. These matters may include mergers and other
extraordinary transactions.


A class of group common stock with less than majority voting power can block action if a class vote is
required.
 If Delaware law, stock exchange rules or the Applera board of directors requires a separate vote on a matter by the holders of either Celera Genomics
common stock or Applied Biosystems common stock, those holders could prevent approval of the matter even if the holders of a majority of the total number of votes cast or entitled to be cast, voting
together as a class, were to vote in favor of it.


Holders of Celera Genomics common stock cannot ensure that their voting power will be sufficient to protect
their interests.
 Since the relative voting power per share of Celera Genomics common stock and Applied Biosystems common stock will fluctuate based on the market
values of the two classes of common stock, the relative voting power of Celera Genomics common stock could decrease. As a result, holders of shares of Celera Genomics common stock cannot ensure that
their voting power will be sufficient to protect their interests. 


Stockholders may not have any remedies for breach of fiduciary duties if any action by directors and
officers has a disadvantageous effect on either class of common stock.
 Stockholders may not have any
remedies if any action or decision of Applera's board of directors or officers has a disadvantageous effect on Celera Genomics common stock or Applied Biosystems common stock compared to the other
class of common stock. 

    Recent
cases in Delaware involving tracking stocks have established that decisions by directors or officers involving differing treatment of tracking stocks are judged under the
principle known as "the business judgment rule" unless self-interest is shown. In addition, principles of Delaware law established in cases involving differing treatment of two classes of
capital common stock or two groups of holders of the same class of capital common stock provide that a board of directors owes an equal duty to all stockholders regardless of class or series. Absent
abuse of discretion, a good faith business decision made by a disinterested and adequately informed board of directors, board of directors' committee or officer of Applera with respect to any matter
having different effects on holders of Celera Genomics common stock and holders of Applied Biosystems common stock would be a defense to any challenge to the determination made by or on behalf of the
holders of either class of common stock. 

Stock ownership could cause directors and officers to favor one group over the other.  

    As a policy, Applera's board of directors periodically monitors the ownership of shares of Celera Genomics common stock and shares of Applied Biosystems common
stock by Applera's directors and senior officers as well as their option holdings and other benefits so that their interests are not misaligned with the two classes of common stock and with their duty
to act in the best interests of Applera and its stockholders as a whole. However, because the actual stock market value of their interests in Celera Genomics common stock and Applied Biosystems common
stock could vary significantly, it is possible that they could favor one group over the other as a result of their common stock holdings, options and other benefits. 

Numerous potential conflicts of interest exist between the classes of common stock that may be difficult to resolve by Applera's board or may be resolved adversely to one of
the classes.  


Allocation of corporate opportunities could favor one group over the
other.
 Applera's board of directors may be required to allocate corporate opportunities between the groups. In some cases, Applera's directors could determine
that a corporate opportunity, such as a business that it is acquiring or a new business, should be shared by the groups or be allocated to one group over the other. Any decisions could favor one group
to the detriment of the other.


The groups may compete with each other to the detriment of their
businesses.
 The existence of two separate classes of common stock will not prevent the Applied Biosystems group and the Celera Genomics group from competing with
each other. Any competition between the groups could be detrimental to businesses of either or both of the groups. Under a board of directors' policy, groups
will generally not engage in the principal businesses of the other, except for joint transactions with each other. However, Applera's Chief Executive Officer or Applera's board of directors will
permit indirect competition between the groups, such as one group doing business with a competitor of the other group, based on his or its good faith business judgment that the competition is in the
best interests of Applera and all of Applera's stockholders as a whole. In addition, the groups may compete in a business that is not a principal business of the other group.


Applera's board of directors may pay more or less dividends on group common stock than if that group were a
separate company.
 Subject to the limitations referred to below, Applera's board of directors has the authority to declare and pay dividends on Celera Genomics
common 

stock
and Applied Biosystems common stock in any amount and could, in its sole discretion, declare and pay dividends exclusively on Celera Genomics common stock, exclusively on Applied Biosystems
common stock, or on both, in equal or unequal amounts. Applera's board of directors is not required to consider the amount of dividends previously declared on each class, the respective voting or
liquidation rights of each class or any other factor. The performance of one group may cause Applera's board of directors to pay more or less dividends on the common stock relating to the other group
than if that other group was a stand-alone corporation. In addition, Delaware law and Applera's certificate of incorporation impose limitations on the amount of dividends that may be paid on each
class of common stock. 


Proceeds of mergers or consolidations may be allocated
unfavorably.
 Applera's board of directors will determine how consideration to be received by holders of common stock in connection with a merger or consolidation
involving Applera is to be allocated among holders of each class of common stock. Such percentage may be materially more or less than that which might have been allocated to the holders had Applera's
board of directors chosen a different method of allocation.


Holders of either class of common stock may be adversely affected by a conversion of group common
stock.
 Applera's board of directors could, in its sole discretion and without stockholder approval, determine to convert shares of Applied Biosystems common
stock into shares of Celera Genomics common stock, or vice versa, at any time, including when either or both classes of common stock may be considered to be overvalued or undervalued. If Applera's
board of directors chose to issue Celera Genomics common stock in exchange for Applied Biosystems common stock, the conversion would dilute the interests in Applera of the holders of Celera Genomics
common stock. If the board of directors were to choose to issue Applied Biosystems common stock in exchange for Celera Genomics common stock, the conversion could give holders of shares of Celera
Genomics common stock a greater or lesser premium than any premium that was paid or might be paid by a third-party buyer of all or substantially all of the assets of the Celera Genomics group.


Cash proceeds of newly issued Celera Genomics common stock in the future could be allocated to the Applied
Biosystems group.
 If and to the extent the Applied Biosystems group has an equity interest in
the Celera Genomics group in the form of "Celera Genomics Designated Shares" at the time of any future sale of Celera Genomics common stock, Applera's board of directors could allocate some or all of
the proceeds of that sale to the Applied Biosystems group. Any decision could favor one group over the other group. For example, the decision to allocate the proceeds to the Applied Biosystems group
could adversely affect the Celera Genomics group's ability to obtain funds to finance its growth strategies. There are no Celera Genomics Designated Shares outstanding as of the date of this proxy
statement/prospectus. 

Applera's board of directors may change its management and allocation policies without stockholder approval to the detriment of either group.  

    Applera's board of directors may modify or rescind Applera's policies with respect to the allocation of corporate overhead, taxes, debt, interest and other
matters, or may adopt additional policies, in its sole discretion without stockholder approval. A decision to modify or rescind these policies, or adopt additional policies, could have different
effects on holders of Celera Genomics common stock and holders of Applied Biosystems common stock or could result in a benefit or detriment to one class of stockholders compared to the other class.
Applera's board of directors will make any decision in accordance with its good faith business judgment that the decision is in the best interests of Applera and all of its stockholders as a whole. 

Either the Celera Genomics group or the Applied Biosystems group may finance the other group on terms unfavorable to itself.  

    From time to time, Applera anticipates that it will transfer cash and other property between groups to finance their business activities. When this occurs, the
group providing the financing will be subject to the risks relating to the group receiving the financing. Applera will account for those transfers in one of the following ways: 


as
a reallocation of pooled debt or preferred stock;


as
a short-term or long-term loan between groups or as a repayment of a previous borrowing;


as
an increase or decrease in the Applied Biosystems group's equity interest, if any, in the Celera Genomics group; or


as
a sale of assets between groups. 

    Applera's
board of directors has not adopted specific criteria for determining when it will account for transfer of cash or other property as a reallocation of pooled debt or
preferred stock, a loan or repayment, an increase or decrease in equity interest or a sale of assets. These determinations, including the terms of any transactions accounted for as debt, may be
unfavorable to either the group transferring or receiving the cash or other property. Applera's board of directors expects to make these determinations, either in specific instances or by setting
generally applicable policies, after considering the financing requirements and objectives of the receiving group, the investment objectives of the transferring group and the availability, cost and
time associated with alternative financing sources, prevailing interest rates and general economic conditions. 

    Applera
cannot assure you that any terms that it fixes for debt will approximate those that could have been obtained by the borrowing group if it were a stand-alone company. 

The Celera Genomics group will not be reimbursed for the Applied Biosystems group's use of its future tax benefits and could incur a higher future tax liability than if it were
a stand-alone taxpayer.  

    Consolidated federal income tax provisions and related tax payments or refunds are allocated between the groups based principally on the taxable income and tax
credits directly attributable to each group. Tax benefits that cannot be used by the group generating those benefits but can be used on a consolidated basis are transferred to the group that can
utilize the benefits. Tax benefits generated by the Celera Genomics group commencing July 1, 1998, which could be utilized on a consolidated basis, are reimbursed by the Applied Biosystems
group to the Celera Genomics group up to a limit of $75 million. The Celera Genomics group has generated cumulative tax benefits in excess of $75 million that have been utilized by the
Applied Biosystems group. Amounts utilized by the Applied Biosystems group in excess of the $75 million limit are not reimbursed and are recorded to group equity by the Celera Genomics group.
Accordingly, any tax benefits that cannot be used by the Celera Genomics group but can be used by the Applied Biosystems group will not be carried forward to reduce the Celera Genomics group's future
tax liability. Use of the tax benefits of the Celera Genomics group by the Applied Biosystems group would result in the Celera Genomics group being charged a greater portion of the total corporate tax
liability in the future than would have been the case if the Celera Genomics group were a stand-alone taxpayer. 

Holders of Celera Genomics common stock may receive less consideration upon a sale of assets than if the Celera Genomics group were a separate company.  

    Applera's certificate of incorporation provides that if a disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of the Celera Genomics group occurs, Applera
must, subject to certain exceptions: 


distribute
to holders of Celera Genomics common stock an amount equal to the net proceeds of the disposition; or


convert
at a 10% premium Celera Genomics common stock into shares of Applied Biosystems common stock. 

    If
the Celera Genomics group were a separate, independent company and its shares were acquired by another person, certain costs of that disposition, including corporate level taxes,
might not be payable in connection with that acquisition. As a result, stockholders of the Celera Genomics group as a separate, independent company might receive a greater amount than the net proceeds
that would be received by holders of Celera Genomics common stock if the assets of the Celera Genomics group were sold. In addition, Applera cannot assure you that the net proceeds per share of Celera
Genomics
common stock will be equal to or more than the market value per share of Celera Genomics common stock prior to or after announcement of a disposition. 

Applera's capital structure and variable vote per share may discourage acquisitions of the Celera Genomics group or Celera Genomics common stock.  

    A potential acquiror could acquire control of Applera by acquiring shares of common stock having a majority of the voting power of all shares of common stock
outstanding. Such a majority could be obtained by acquiring a sufficient number of shares of both classes of common stock or, if one class of common stock has a majority of the voting power, only
shares of that class. Currently, Applied Biosystems common stock has a substantial majority of the voting power. As a result, it might be possible for an acquiror to obtain control by purchasing only
shares of Applied Biosystems common stock. 

Decisions by Applera's board of directors and officers that affect market values could adversely affect voting and conversion rights.  

    The relative voting power per share of each class of common stock and the number of shares of one class of common stock issuable upon the conversion of the
other class of common stock will vary depending upon the relative market values of Celera Genomics common stock and Applied Biosystems common stock. The market value of either or both classes of
common stock could be adversely affected by market reaction to decisions by Applera's board of directors or Applera's management that investors perceive as affecting differently one class of common
stock compared to the other. These decisions could involve changes to Applera's management and allocation policies, transfers of assets between groups, allocations of corporate opportunities and
financing resources between groups and changes in dividend policies. 

Investors may not value Celera Genomics common stock based on the Celera Genomics group's financial information and policies.  

    Applera cannot assure you that investors will value Celera Genomics common stock based on the reported financial results and prospects of the Celera Genomics
group or the dividend policies established by Applera's board of directors with respect to the Celera Genomics group. 

Provisions governing common stock could discourage a change of control and the payment of a premium for stockholders' shares.  

    Applera's stockholder rights plan could prevent stockholders from profiting from an increase in the market value of their shares as a result of a change in
control of Applera by delaying or preventing a change in control. The existence of two classes of common stock could also present complexities and could, in certain circumstances, pose obstacles,
financial and otherwise, to an acquiring person. In addition, certain provisions of Delaware law and Applera's certificate of incorporation and bylaws may also deter hostile takeover attempts. 

Legislative proposals could have adverse tax consequences for us or for holders of Celera Genomics common stock and Applied Biosystems common stock.  

    The Clinton Administration Budget Proposals in 1999 and 2000 proposed legislation that would have adversely affected holders of tracking stock such as Celera
Genomics common stock and Applied Biosystems common stock. Although Congress did not act on either proposal and the recent Bush Administration Budget Proposal does not contain a similar provision, it
is impossible to predict whether any proposals relating to tracking stock will be made in the future, and to what extent Congress would act upon any proposals. 

    Applera
may convert Celera Genomics common stock or Applied Biosystems common stock into shares of the other class without any premium if, based on the legal opinion of its tax
counsel, it is more likely than not as a result of the enactment of legislative changes or administrative proposals or changes that Applera or its stockholders will be subject to tax upon issuance of
Celera Genomics common stock or Applied Biosystems common stock or that the stock will not be treated as stock of Applera. 

Risks Related to Axys  

    By not voting in favor of approving and adopting the merger agreement and approving the merger, you will be choosing to continue your ownership of Axys common
stock. If the merger is completed, the business operations of Axys will be integrated into the research and development and business operations of the Celera Genomics group. You should carefully
consider the following factors before voting on the proposal to approve and adopt the merger agreement and approve the merger. 

If Axys does not consummate the merger under the merger agreement, the market value of Axys common stock may decrease and Axys may not be able to locate or consummate a
strategic combination with another company on equal or more favorable terms.  

    As a result of the proposed merger under the merger agreement, the trading price of Axys common stock includes a premium per share and fluctuates in relation
to the trading price of Celera Genomics common stock. However, if Axys does not consummate the merger, the trading price of Axys common stock will no longer be affected by the trading price of Celera
Genomics common stock, and the trading price of Axys common stock may decrease if no other third party is offering to purchase Axys common stock at a premium. In addition, Axys may not be able to
identify another strategic partner that would be willing to provide Axys' stockholders with a premium over market price equivalent to that offered by Applera. Further, if Axys does not consummate the
proposed merger, a third party may determine on that basis that Axys is not an attractive strategic partner. 

If Axys fails to discover or develop or is delayed in the development of pharmaceuticals, its business and results of operations will be adversely affected.  

    All of Axys' potential pharmaceutical products are in various stages of research and development and will require significant additional research and
development efforts before Axys can sell them. These efforts include extensive preclinical and clinical testing and lengthy regulatory review and approval by the United States Food and Drug
Administration. The development of Axys' new pharmaceutical products is highly uncertain and subject to a number of significant risks. To date, Axys has not developed a commercial drug and Axys does
not expect any of its pharmaceuticals to be commercially available for a number of years. Pharmaceuticals that appear to be promising at early stages of development may not reach the market for a
number of reasons, including the following: 


Axys
or its collaborators may not successfully complete any research and development efforts;


any
pharmaceuticals Axys develops may be found to be ineffective or to cause harmful side effects during preclinical testing or clinical trials;


Axys
may fail to obtain required regulatory approvals for any products it develops;


Axys
may be unable to manufacture enough of any potential products at an acceptable cost and with appropriate quality;


Axys'
products may not be competitive with other existing or future products; and


proprietary
rights of third parties may prevent Axys from commercializing its products. 

Axys may not be successful in developing a commercial drug.  

    Axys is primarily engaged in the earliest stage of drug discovery; namely, the design and systematic evaluation of therapeutic small molecule compounds. Axys'
drug discovery programs are unproven. Although Axys has expended, and continues to expend, time and money on internal research and development programs, Axys may be unsuccessful in creating drug
candidates that would enable it to form additional collaborations and receive milestone and/or royalty payments. Even if Axys is able to negotiate additional collaborations, Axys may never discover
potential drug candidates that ultimately lead to a commercially available drug. Axys has not yet created, or contributed to the creation of, a commercial drug and there can be no assurance that Axys
ever will discover, create or contribute to the creation of a commercial drug. Axys does not currently have the internal capability to move potential products through clinical testing, manufacturing
and the approval process of the United States Food and Drug Administration. 

If the merger is not completed and Axys fails to obtain additional financing to fund its operations, it will be unable to complete its product development efforts.  

    The development of Axys' potential drugs will require substantially more money than Axys currently has. That means that if the merger fails to occur, Axys will
have to obtain commitments for substantial funds in order to conduct the costly and time-consuming research and preclinical and clinical testing activities necessary to develop its drugs.
Axys cannot be certain that any financing will be available when needed. If Axys fails to secure additional financing, as needed, it will have to delay or terminate its drug development programs. 

    In
April 2000, Axys successfully sold its share of Axys Advanced Technologies (which we refer to in this proxy statement/prospectus as "Advanced Technologies"), now ChemRx
Advanced Technologies Inc., to Discovery Partners for 7,425,000 shares of Discovery Partners common stock. As of June 7, 2001, Axys held 7,246,500 shares of Discovery Partners common
stock. In December 2000, Axys successfully sold its shares of PPGx, Inc. to DNA Sciences for approximately $15 million in preferred stock of DNA Sciences. Axys' DNA Sciences
shares and Discovery Partners shares are subject to contractual restrictions that limit its ability to liquidate its position in a timely manner. DNA 

Sciences is a privately held company and there are limited opportunities to dispose of Axys' interest. There can be no assurance that the businesses in which Axys holds these equity positions will be
successful or that Axys will have the ability to sell all or a portion of its equity ownership in these businesses. In addition, there can be no assurance that the amount Axys may receive upon selling
its equity ownership interest will provide significant funding so as to postpone for a meaningful time period the need to engage in other capital raising activities. 

    If
the merger is not completed, even if Axys is successful in obtaining financing from the sale of its interests in Discovery Partners and DNA Sciences, Axys believes it will still
need to pursue other financing opportunities to fund its research and development. Axys' future financing needs will depend on many factors, including the following: 


scientific
progress in the research and development of drug development programs;


the
size and complexity of these programs;


the
timing, range and results of preclinical studies and clinical trials;


Axys'
ability to establish new and maintain existing collaborations;


Axys'
ability to achieve any milestones under the collaborations; and


the
time and costs involved in getting regulatory approvals or in filing, enforcing or prosecuting patents. 

    If
the merger is not completed, Axys expects that it will need to continue to raise money for a number of years until it achieves, if it ever achieves, substantial product or royalty
revenues. Axys expects that it will seek additional funding through new collaborations, the extension of existing collaborations, through sale of its interests in Discovery Partners and DNA Sciences,
or through public or private equity or debt financings. Axys cannot be certain that additional funding will be available or that the terms will be acceptable. Existing stockholders will experience
dilution of their investment if Axys raises additional funds by issuing equity. If adequate funds are not available, Axys may delay, reduce or eliminate any of its research or development programs.
Furthermore, Axys may obtain funds through arrangements with collaborative partners or others that require it to give up rights to technologies or products that it would otherwise seek to develop or
commercialize itself. 

If the merger is not completed, Axys' increased leverage could affect its ability to service its debt obligations or incur additional debt, which could negatively affect its
stock price.  

    Axys is and will continue to be leveraged. At March 31, 2001, Axys had total indebtedness of approximately $28.3 million (of which
$26 million consisted of its convertible notes and the balance consists of outstanding balances under its capital lease obligations) and stockholders' equity of approximately
$71.7 million. Axys' ability to make scheduled payments of principal of, or to pay the interest on, or to refinance, its indebtedness, including the notes, or to fund planned capital
expenditures and research and development expenses, will depend on its future performance, which, to a certain extent, is subject to general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory
and other factors that are beyond its control. Axys may need to refinance all or a portion of the principal of the notes on or prior to maturity. If the merger is not completed, there can be no
assurance that Axys' business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations or that future borrowings will be available in an amount sufficient to enable it to service its indebtedness, including
the notes, or to fund its other liquidity needs. In addition, there can be no assurance that Axys will be able to effect any refinancing on commercially reasonable terms or at all. 

    Axys'
indebtedness could have significant additional negative consequences, including: 


increasing
its vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions;


limiting
its ability to obtain additional financing; 


requiring
the dedication of a substantial portion of Axys' expected cash flow from operations to service its indebtedness, thereby reducing the amount of
its expected cash flow available for other purposes, including capital expenditures;


limiting
Axys' flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in its business and the industry in which it competes; and


placing
Axys at a possible competitive disadvantage to less leveraged competitors and competitors that have better access to capital resources. 

If the merger is not completed, if Axys continues to incur operating losses for longer than expected, it may be unable to continue operations and its stock price may decline.  

    While Axys generated net income of $9.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2000, it generated a net loss of $18 million for the
quarter ended March 31, 2001 and Axys may never sustain profitability and does not expect to remain profitable in fiscal year 2001. Axys was profitable for fiscal year 2000 due to the sale, for
stock, of two of its non-core subsidiary companies: Advanced Technologies, which was sold to Discovery Partners, and PPGx, which was sold to DNA Sciences. Axys has experienced
significant continuing operating losses since it commenced operations. Axys has not generated any pharmaceutical product sales revenue. For the year ended December 31, 2000, Axys generated a
net loss from continuing operations of approximately $45.4 million, and as of December 31, 2000, it had an accumulated deficit of approximately $267.4 million. Axys expects that
it will continue to incur significant operating losses over at least the next several years as its research and development efforts and preclinical and clinical testing activities continue. Axys'
future profitability depends on its ability to complete product development and obtain regulatory approval for its drug candidates. If the merger is not completed, and Axys fails to become profitable
or is unable to sustain profitability on a quarterly or annual basis, it may be unable to continue operations and its stock price may decline. 

If Axys fails to maintain its existing collaborative relationships and enter into new collaborative relationships, development of its products could be delayed or Axys may need
to obtain other sources of revenue if the merger is not completed.  

    Axys' strategy for the development, clinical testing, manufacturing and commercialization of most of its pharmaceuticals has included entering into
collaborations with corporate partners. Axys relies to a large extent on the activities of its collaborators with respect to the development and commercialization of its pharmaceuticals. All of Axys'
collaboration agreements may be canceled under certain circumstances. Some of these agreements contain provisions that might permit the other party to the contract to terminate certain aspects of the
contractual relationship relating to research and development if the merger takes place, and there is no assurance these parties will not seek to exercise these termination rights after the merger. In
addition, the amount and timing of resources to be devoted to research, development, eventual clinical trials and commercialization activities by Axys' collaborators are not within Axys' control. Axys
cannot guarantee that its partners will perform their obligations as expected. If any of Axys' collaborators terminate or elect to cancel their agreements or otherwise fail to conduct their
collaborative activities in a timely manner, the development or commercialization of pharmaceuticals may be delayed. If in some cases Axys assumes responsibilities for continuing unpartnered programs
after cancellation of a collaboration, Axys may be required to devote additional resources to product development and commercialization or Axys may cancel certain development programs. 

    A
large portion of Axys' revenues to date have resulted from these collaborations. In the event the merger is not completed, the research funding phase of most of Axys' collaborations
will come to an end in the next year unless continued or extended by agreement with Axys' collaborators. In this case, if Axys' collaborations are not extended or Axys does not enter into additional
collaborative 

relationships, Axys will have to seek other sources of revenue, including additional financing and/or selling interests in its affiliated businesses. Axys cannot be certain that it will receive any
additional revenue from these arrangements beyond the minimum contractual commitments of its partners. 

If Axys fails to satisfy United States Food and Drug Administration safety and efficacy requirements in its clinical trails for any pharmaceutical, Axys will be unable to
complete the development and commercialization of that pharmaceutical product.  

    Either Axys or its collaborators must show through preclinical studies and clinical trials that each of Axys' pharmaceuticals is safe and effective in humans
for each indication before obtaining regulatory clearance from the United States Food and Drug Administration for the commercial sale of that pharmaceutical. If Axys fails to adequately show the
safety and effectiveness of a pharmaceutical, regulatory approval could be delayed or denied. The results from preclinical studies and early clinical trials are often different than the results that
are obtained in large-scale testing. Axys cannot be certain that it will show sufficient safety and effectiveness in its clinical trials to allow it to obtain the needed regulatory approval. A number
of companies in the pharmaceutical industry, including biotechnology companies, have suffered significant setbacks in advanced clinical trials, even after promising results in earlier trials. 

    Any
drug is likely to produce some level of toxicity or undesirable side effects in animals and in humans when administered at sufficiently high doses and/or for a long period of
time. Unacceptable toxicities or side effects may occur in the course of toxicity studies or clinical trials. If Axys observes unacceptable toxicities or side effects, Axys, its collaborators or
regulatory authorities may interrupt, limit, delay or halt the development of the drug. In addition, these unacceptable toxicities or side effects could prevent approval by the United States Food and
Drug Administration or foreign regulatory authorities for any or all indications. 

    In
the fourth quarter of 2000, Axys completed a Phase II clinical trial on its compound, APC 2059, in ulcerative colitis. Before moving forward to more advanced trials, Axys has
recently determined that extensive safety pharmacology and dose-ranging pre-clinical research is necessary. Axys determined that it would not undertake this research and
intends to seek a partner who is willing to conduct this research, as well as undertake additional clinical and commercial activities. As these clinical trials are intended to establish safety in
humans, Axys cannot be certain that it will be able to initiate or complete necessary future clinical trials successfully. Axys' collaboration partner, Bayer, is moving forward with advanced
pre-clinical studies of a compound developed in Axys' collaboration with them for the treatment of asthma that would be taken as a pill. Axys cannot be certain that the clinical trials of
this compound will be initiated or completed successfully. Finally, Axys cannot be certain that any other drug candidates which may enter clinical trials will successfully complete those trials or
that Axys or its collaborators will be able to show the safety and effectiveness of these drug candidates. 

If Axys fails to obtain regulatory approvals to commercially manufacture or sell any of its drugs, or if approval is delayed, Axys will be unable to generate revenue from the
sale of its products.  

    Axys must obtain regulatory approval before marketing or selling its future drug products. In the United States, Axys must obtain United States Food and Drug
Administration approval for each drug that it intends to commercialize. The United States Food and Drug Administration approval process is lengthy and expensive, and approval is never certain.
Products distributed abroad are also subject to foreign government regulation. The process of obtaining United States Food and Drug Administration
and other required regulatory approvals can vary a great deal based upon the type, complexity and novelty of the products involved. Delays or rejections may be encountered based upon additional
government regulation from future legislation or administrative action or changes in United States Food and Drug Administration policy during the period of clinical trials and United States Food and
Drug Administration regulatory review. Similar delays also may be encountered in foreign countries. 

    None of Axys' drug candidates has received regulatory approval. If Axys fails to obtain this approval, Axys will be unable to commercially manufacture and sell its drug products. Axys
has several drugs in various stages of preclinical development and one drug which recently completed the initial phase of Phase II clinical development. These products are not expected to be available
for several more years, if at all. Because of the risks and uncertainties involved in development of drug products, Axys' drug candidates could take significantly longer to gain approval than Axys
expects or may never gain approval. If regulatory approval is delayed, the market value of Axys and its operating results could be adversely affected. Even if regulatory approval of a product is
granted, Axys cannot be certain that it will be able to obtain the labeling claims necessary or desirable for the successful promotion of those products. 

    Even
if Axys obtains regulatory approval, it may be required to continue clinical studies even after it has started selling a drug. In addition, identification of certain side effects
after a drug is on the market or the occurrence of manufacturing problems could cause subsequent withdrawal of approval, reformulation of a drug, additional preclinical testing or clinical trials and
changes in labeling of the product. This could delay or prevent Axys from generating revenues from the sale of that drug or cause Axys' revenues to decline. 

If regulatory approval to commercially manufacture or sell any of its drugs is obtained, Axys will also be subject to ongoing existing and future United States Food and Drug
Administration regulations and guidelines and continued regulatory review.  

    In particular, Axys or any third party that Axys uses to manufacture the drug or Axys' collaborators will be required to adhere to regulations setting forth
current good manufacturing practices. The regulations require that Axys manufacture its products and maintain its records in a particular way with respect to manufacturing, testing and quality control
activities. Furthermore, Axys or its third party manufacturers or its collaborators must pass a pre-approval inspection of its manufacturing facilities by the United States Food and Drug
Administration before obtaining marketing approval. 

    Failure
to comply with the United States Food and Drug Administration or other relevant regulatory requirements may subject Axys to administrative or legally imposed restrictions.
These include: warning letters, civil penalties, injunctions, product seizure or detention, product recalls, total or partial suspension of production and United States Food and Drug Administration
refusal to approve pending New Drug Applications (which we refer to in this proxy statement/prospectus as NDAs), or supplements to approved NDAs. 

If Axys is unable to effectively protect its intellectual property, it may not be able to compete effectively.  

    Axys' success depends in a large part on its ability to obtain patents, maintain trade secrets and operate without infringing the intellectual property rights
of others, both in the United States and in other countries. 

    Patents
may not be issued from any of Axys' pending or future applications. Patent applications in the United States are maintained in secrecy until the patent is issued. As a result,
Axys cannot be certain that others have not filed patent applications for technology covered by its pending patent applications or that Axys was the first to invent the technology. In addition, an
issued patent may be challenged, invalidated or maneuvered around or it may otherwise not be sufficient to protect Axys' technology. The patent positions of biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies
can be highly uncertain and involve complex legal and factual questions. As a result, it is difficult to predict the breadth of claims allowed in biotechnology and pharmaceutical patents or their
enforceability. 

    Axys'
commercial success also depends, in part, on not infringing patents issued to others and not breaching the technology licenses upon which any of its potential products are
based. Competitors may 

have filed applications for, or may have received patents and may obtain additional patents and rights relating to, genes, products or processes that block or compete with Axys' patents and rights. A
number of third parties have filed patent applications or received patents in the areas of Axys' programs. Some of these applications or patents may limit or hinder Axys' patent applications, or
conflict in certain ways with claims made under Axys' issued patents. Furthermore, in the past Axys has been, and may from time to time in the future be, notified of claims that it is infringing
patents or other intellectual property rights owned by third parties. 

    Axys
may have to participate in interference proceedings declared by the United States Patent and Trademark Office. These proceedings determine the priority of invention and the right
to a patent for the technology in the United States. In addition, lawsuits may be necessary to enforce any patents issued to Axys or to determine the scope and validity of the rights of third parties.
Lawsuits and interference proceedings, even if they are successful, are expensive to pursue, and Axys could use a substantial amount of its limited financial resources in either case. An adverse
outcome could subject Axys to significant liabilities to third parties and require Axys to license disputed rights from third parties or to cease using the technology. 

    It
is also unclear whether Axys' trade secrets will provide useful protection. Axys protects its own technology and processes, in part, by confidentiality agreements with its
employees, consultants and certain contractors. However, these agreements may be disregarded or breached, and Axys may not
have adequate remedies for any breach. In addition, it is possible that Axys' trade secrets will otherwise become known or be independently discovered by competitors. 

    Disputes
may arise in the future with regard to the ownership of rights to any technology developed with collaborators. These and other possible disagreements with collaborators could
lead to delays in the achievement of milestones or receipt of royalty payments or in research, development and commercialization of Axys' pharmaceuticals. In addition, these disputes could require or
result in lawsuits or arbitration. Lawsuits and arbitration are time-consuming and expensive. Even if Axys wins, the cost of these proceedings could adversely affect its business,
financial condition and results of operations. Furthermore, these proceedings could adversely affect Axys' stock price or its business reputation and may make the process of entering into additional
collaborative relationships more difficult. 

Because Axys does not have manufacturing facilities for its proposed drug products or commercial manufacturing experience, Axys could experience manufacturing delays or
problems that hurt its product sales.  

    Axys has no manufacturing facilities for its proposed drug products, and its potential products have never been commercially manufactured. Axys must currently
rely on its collaborators, Merck, Aventis, and Bayer, to manufacture its products. Axys must find contract manufacturers or commit capital to establish United States Food and Drug Administration
approved facilities for non-partnered drug candidates. If Axys or its collaborators or third party manufacturers are unable to manufacture or contract with others for a sufficient supply
of Axys' compounds on acceptable terms, Axys may have to delay any of the following: 


Axys'
preclinical and clinical testing schedule;


Axys'
submission of products for regulatory approval; or


the
market introduction and subsequent sales of products. 

    Any
of these delays could adversely affect Axys' financial condition and results of operations. 

    Not
only Axys, but Axys' collaborators and contract manufacturers must adhere to current Good Manufacturing Practices regulations enforced by the United States Food and Drug
Administration 

through its facilities inspection program. If these facilities cannot pass a pre-approval plant inspection, United States Food and Drug Administration approval of Axys' products will not
be granted or will be delayed. 

If Axys fails to recruit and retain professional staff, Axys' product development programs will be delayed.  

    Axys is highly dependent on the senior members of its scientific and management staff. Retaining and attracting qualified personnel, consultants and advisors
is critical to Axys' success. If Axys fails to recruit and retain qualified personnel, its product development efforts will be delayed. Axys faces intense competition for qualified individuals from
numerous pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, universities and other research institutions. Axys has experienced high attrition rates in the last several years due in part to restructuring
following Axys' 1998 acquisition of Sequana Therapeutics, Inc. Axys is currently seeking to hire additional qualified scientific personnel to perform research and development. In addition, Axys
expects that it will need to add management personnel and develop additional expertise by existing management personnel in order to expand product development and clinical testing. Axys cannot be
certain that it will be able to attract and retain these individuals on acceptable terms or at all. 

    In
addition, Axys' collaborators and consultants are not its employees. As a result, Axys has limited control over their activities and can expect that only limited amounts of their
time will be dedicated to Axys' activities. Academic collaborators may also have relationships with other commercial entities, some of whom may be Axys' competitors. 

Axys' future stock price may be volatile and your investment could suffer a decline in market value.  

    Stock prices and trading volumes for biotechnology companies often fluctuate widely for reasons that may be unrelated to their businesses. Axys' stock price
could decline as a result of many factors, including: 


announcements
of technological innovations or new products by Axys or other companies;


developments
or disputes concerning patents or other rights;


publicity
regarding actual or potential medical results from products under development by Axys or other companies;


regulatory
developments in both the United States and foreign countries;


public
concern regarding the safety of biopharmaceutical products;


any
shortfall in Axys' revenues, net income or cash reserves from that expected by securities analysts;


changes
in analyst's estimates of Axys' financial performance, the financial performance of Axys' competitors or the financial performance of biotechnology
companies in general;


sales
of large blocks of Axys' common stock; or


conditions
in the financial markets or economy in general or the biotechnology industry in particular. 

    In
the past, following large price declines in the public market price of a company's securities, securities litigation has often been initiated against that company. Litigation of
this type could result in substantial costs and diversion of management's attention and resources. Any adverse determination in litigation could subject Axys to substantial liabilities. 

If product liability claims are brought against Axys, Axys may incur substantial liabilities.  

    Axys may be exposed to liability claims resulting from the use of its products in clinical trials, or the manufacturing, marketing and sale of any approved
products. These claims may be made directly by consumers, pharmaceutical companies or others. Axys maintains product liability insurance coverage for claims arising from the use of its products that
are still in the developmental phase. However, this insurance coverage is becoming increasingly expensive. Axys and its collaborative partners may not be able to obtain and maintain product liability
insurance on commercially reasonable terms. Furthermore, even if Axys maintains insurance, the amount may not be enough to protect Axys against losses due to
a lawsuit. A successful product liability claim against Axys or series of claims in excess of its insurance could adversely affect its results of operations and result in a need for additional
financing. 

Anti-takeover provisions under Delaware law and in Axys' charter documents and its stockholders rights plan could make a subsequent acquisition of Axys more
difficult.  

    In 1998, Axys adopted a stockholder rights plan, which may have the effect of delaying or preventing an unsolicited takeover of Axys. Axys' certificate of
incorporation and bylaws state that any action taken by stockholders must be conducted at an annual or special meeting of stockholders and may not be conducted by written consent. Only the board of
directors, the Chairman of the Board or the President may call special meetings of the stockholders. In addition, the Axys board of directors has the authority to issue additional shares of preferred
stock and to determine the rights of those shares without any further action by the stockholders. Those rights could be senior to those of the common stockholders. The issuance of preferred stock may
make it more difficult for a third party to acquire Axys. These and other charter provisions may discourage certain types of transactions involving an actual or potential change in control of Axys. In
fact, these provisions may discourage transactions in which the stockholders might otherwise receive a premium for their shares over then current prices, and may limit the stockholders' ability to
approve transactions that they think are in their best interests. 

    Delaware
law also prohibits corporations from engaging in a business combination with any holders of 15% or more of their capital stock until the holder has held the stock for three
years unless, among other things, the board approves the transaction. Also, under Delaware law, the Axys board of directors may adopt additional anti-takeover measures in the future. 

Axys' senior secured notes are convertible into shares of common stock; there are risks associated with redeeming these notes and their conversion may be dilutive.  

    In September 2000, Axys issued $26 million in senior secured convertible notes, which bear interest at 8% per annum and have a conversion price
of $7.06 per share. These notes are due in November 2004; however, the holders of the notes may choose to convert the notes at any time into shares of Axys common stock. Upon maturity of these
notes, the holders may choose to have the notes repaid in cash or shares of its common stock. If the merger is not completed, in the event that some or all of the note holders request that the notes
be repaid in cash upon maturity in November 2004, Axys may not have sufficient cash to satisfy all of its obligations under the notes. The underlying collateral pledged against those notes
(approximately 6.7 million shares of Discovery Partners stock owned by Axys) may not be sufficient to satisfy the debt obligation. In addition, conversion of these notes into common stock will
be dilutive to the stockholders. 

THE SPECIAL MEETING    

This proxy statement/prospectus is being furnished to stockholders of Axys in connection with the solicitation of proxies by the board
of directors of Axys for use at the special meeting of its stockholders.

Date, Time and Place  

    The special meeting will be held at Axys' headquarters located at 180 Kimball Way, South San Francisco, California 94080, at 10:00 a.m. Pacific Time, on
[            ], 2001. 

Purpose of the Special Meeting  

    At the special meeting, holders of Axys common stock will be asked to consider and vote upon the approval and adoption of the merger agreement and the approval
of the merger and such other matters as may properly be brought before the special meeting. 

    The
Axys board of directors has, by unanimous vote, approved the merger agreement and the merger and the transactions contemplated thereby, and recommends a vote FOR approval and
adoption of the merger agreement and approval of the merger. 

Record Date; Stock Entitled to Vote  

    Only holders of record of Axys common stock at the close of business on [            ], 2001, the record date for the special
meeting, are entitled to receive notice of and to vote at the special meeting. Axys common stock constitutes the only issued and outstanding class of voting securities of Axys. 

    On
the record date, [            ] shares of Axys common stock were issued and outstanding and were held by [      ]
holders of record. Holders of record of shares of Axys common stock on the record date are each entitled to one vote per share on each matter to be considered at the special meeting. 

Quorum  

    The presence at the special meeting, either in person or by proxy, of a majority of the shares of Axys common stock outstanding on the record date is necessary
to constitute a quorum to transact business at the special meeting. If a quorum is not present, it is expected that the special meeting will be adjourned or postponed in order to solicit additional
proxies. 

    Abstentions
and "broker non-votes" will be counted for the purpose of determining whether a quorum is present. Broker non-votes are shares held by brokers or
nominees on behalf of customers that are represented at the meeting but with respect to which the broker or nominee has not been instructed how to vote. Brokers holding shares of Axys common stock in
street name for customers are prohibited from voting those customers' shares regarding the merger agreement and the merger in the absence of specific instructions from those customers. 

Vote Required  

    The approval and adoption of the merger agreement and the approval of the merger requires the affirmative vote of holders of a majority of the shares of Axys
common stock issued and outstanding and entitled to vote on the record date for the special meeting. If you abstain from voting or do not vote, either in person or by proxy, it will have the same
effect of a vote against adoption and approval of the merger agreement and approval of the merger. 

Share Ownership of Management and Others  

    At the close of business on the record date, directors and executive officers of Axys and their affiliates beneficially owned and were entitled to vote
approximately [            ] shares of Axys common stock, representing approximately [  ]% of the shares of Axys common stock
issued and outstanding on the record date. Each of those directors and executive officers has indicated his or her present intention to vote, or cause to be voted, the Axys common stock owned by him
FOR the approval and adoption of the merger agreement and approval of the merger. 

Voting of Proxies  

    Shares represented by all properly executed proxies received in time for the special meeting will be voted at the special meeting in the manner specified by
the holders thereof. Except for the broker non-votes, properly executed proxies that do not contain voting instructions will be voted in favor of the approval and adoption of the merger
agreement and approval of the merger. 

    For
voting purposes at the special meeting, only shares affirmatively voted in favor of approval and adoption of the merger agreement and approval of the merger will be counted as
favorable votes for the approval and adoption. The failure to submit a proxy (or to vote in person) or the abstention from voting or submission of a broker non-vote with respect to the
approval and adoption will have the same effect as a vote against approval and adoption of the merger agreement and approval of the merger. 

    It
is not expected that any matter other than those referred to in this proxy statement/prospectus will be brought before the special meeting. If, however, other matters are properly
presented for a vote, the persons named as proxies will vote in accordance with their judgment with respect to those matters. The persons named as proxies by a holder of Axys common stock may propose
and vote for one or more adjournments of the special meeting to permit further solicitations of proxies in favor of approval and adoption of the merger agreement and approval of the merger; however,
no proxy which is voted against the approval and adoption of the merger agreement and approval of the merger will be voted in favor of an adjournment. 

Revoking Proxies  

    Holders of Axys common stock on the record date may revoke their proxies at any time prior to the time their proxies are voted at the special meeting. Proxies
may be revoked by written notice, including by telegram or facsimile, to the Secretary of Axys, by a later-dated proxy signed and returned by mail, or by attending the special meeting and voting in
person. Attendance at the special meeting will not in and of itself constitute a revocation of a proxy. Any written notice of a revocation of a proxy must be sent so as to be delivered before the
taking of the vote at the special meeting as follows: 

Axys

South San Francisco, CA 94080

Facsimile: (650) 829-1147

Attention: William J. Newell 

Proxy Solicitation  

    Axys will bear the cost of the solicitation of proxies from its stockholders, except that Applera will pay 75% of the cost of filing, printing and distributing
the registration statement and this proxy statement/prospectus and Axys will be responsible for 25% of these costs. In addition to solicitation by mail, the directors, officers and employees of Axys
may solicit proxies from stockholders of Axys by telephone or telegram or by other means of communication. Such directors, officers and employees will 

not be additionally compensated but may be reimbursed for reasonable out-of-pocket expenses in connection with the solicitation. 

    Axys
has retained MacKenzie Partners, Inc. to assist in the solicitation of proxies by Axys. Axys will pay $6,000, plus reimbursement of some
out-of-pocket expenses, to MacKenzie Partners for its services. Axys will cause brokerage houses and other custodians, nominees and fiduciaries to forward solicitation
materials to the beneficial owners of common stock held of record by those persons. Axys will reimburse any of these custodians, nominees and fiduciaries for their reasonable
out-of-pocket expenses in doing so. 

Do not send in any stock certificates with your proxy cards. Applera will instruct its exchange agent to send transmittal forms with instructions for the
surrender of certificates representing shares of Axys common stock in exchange for the issuance of certificates representing shares of Celera Genomics common stock to former holders of Axys common
stock shortly after the merger is completed.

THE MERGER    

    The following is a description of certain aspects of the proposed merger, including the material terms of the merger agreement. The following summary is
qualified in its entirety by reference to the complete merger agreement, which is attached to this proxy statement/prospectus as Annex A, and is incorporated in this proxy statement/prospectus by
reference. All stockholders of Axys are urged to read the merger agreement in its entirety. 

Background of the Merger  

    In January 2000, Axys' management and board of directors concluded that Axys should explore opportunities for a strategic combination with a company in
the life sciences industry. Axys was concerned that its limited financial resources and limited access to novel drug targets would constrain Axys' long-term ability to capitalize on its
core scientific assets, primarily its highly skilled scientific employee base. In addition, Axys was concerned about its continuing ability to access additional capital in the
shorter-term. This concern was heightened by Axys' challenges in realizing near-term value from any of its affiliated businesses. Consequently, Axys engaged Lehman Brothers as
its financial advisor and, through Lehman Brothers, Axys held preliminary discussions with various potential strategic parties during the first two quarters of 2000. None of these discussions
progressed beyond the preliminary stage, and on or about August 2000, Axys terminated its relationship with Lehman Brothers. 

    In
addition to exploring the opportunities for strategic combinations during the first half of 2000, Axys also sought additional financing for its operations, and engaged in a series
of transactions in 2000 to provide Axys with further funding. In March 2000, Axys raised approximately $31.5 million in gross proceeds through a private placement of Axys common stock.
In April 2000, Axys merged its subsidiary Advanced Technologies with Discovery Partners and acquired 7,425,000 shares of Discovery Partners stock. Discovery Partners subsequently went public in
July 2000; however, the Discovery Partners shares owned by Axys, which represented approximately 33% of Discovery Partners' outstanding shares, were subject to an underwriters' lock up until
January 2001 and continue to be subject to various restrictions on resale. In July 2000, Axys put in place an equity line of credit for up to $50 million and made an initial draw
down of $10 million. In September 2000, Axys raised an additional $26 million by selling convertible notes with warrants, which notes were collateralized by most of Axys'
Discovery Partners shares. Based on the closing price of Discovery Partners common stock on the Nasdaq National Market on September 1, 2000, Axys' 33% stake in Discovery Partners had a market
value in excess of $145 million. In December 2000, Axys agreed to merge its subsidiary PPGx with another private company, DNA Sciences. Although DNA Sciences filed for an initial public
offering in January 2001, it has not proceeded with that offering. Axys' other spinout business, Akkadix, sought but failed to secure additional funding in late 2000, and in early 2001, laid
off a substantial portion of its workforce and was forced to reduce its operations. 

    In
Axys' view during late 2000, the following factors were important to its continuing ability to fund its programs for the next several years: (1) the ability to sell its
Discovery Partners shares and the amount that could be realized from that sale, since their market value had declined substantially since the convertible note transaction in which $26 million
had been borrowed, (2) the ability to sell its shares in privately-held DNA Sciences and the amount that could be realized from that sale, (3) the ability to raise additional
funding through the equity line or other sources despite the current difficult biotech funding environment and (4) the entry into additional research and development collaborations to further
reduce Axys' operating expenditures. 

    In
January 2001, Axys received an unsolicited invitation from an interested party in the life sciences industry to discuss a possible strategic combination. In February, in
response to the overture from this interested party, Axys requested JPMorgan H&Q, a division of J.P. Morgan Securities Inc. to assist Axys in identifying potential merger partners, exploring
other strategic and financial transactions 

for Axys and reviewing publicly available information regarding possible merger partners. JPMorgan H&Q was formally engaged by Axys on May 7, 2001. The discussions with the initial interested
party ended at an early stage. During the course of the ensuing months, JPMorgan H&Q and/or Axys engaged in discussions with approximately 10 other potential strategic parties, including Applera,
which were potential merger partners for Axys and/or which Axys believed might have the potential to provide Axys with novel targets and other valuable resources. 

    On
April 2, Paul Hastings, Axys' President and Chief Executive Officer, Dr. Michael Venuti, Senior Vice President, Research and Preclinical Development and Chief
Technical Officer and William Newell, Senior Vice President, Corporate & Business Development, met with Dr. Peter Barrett, Chief Business Officer of the Celera Genomics group, to discuss
a possible transaction in very general terms. On that same date, Axys and Applera entered into a confidentiality agreement. Executives of both companies, as well as their respective financial
advisors, met periodically over the ensuing weeks to explore a potential strategic combination. Commencing in mid-April, Applera began a preliminary due diligence review of Axys'
operations. 

    On
May 2 and 3, a team from the Celera Genomics group led by Dr. Barrett met with Axys management to further discuss the Axys business. After that meeting and throughout
the remainder of May, Applera conducted a more thorough due diligence review of Axys' business, scientific, legal and financial affairs and engaged in more in depth discussions with Axys' senior
management team. During the month of May, Axys and Applera and their respective financial advisors also commenced preliminary negotiations regarding the possible financial terms for a merger. The
board of directors of Axys held meetings on May 14, May 17, May 23 and June 1 with Axys' management and legal advisors and, except with respect to the May 23
meeting, representatives of JPMorgan H&Q, concerning the progress of the Applera negotiations and related matters. During these meetings, the board of directors instructed management and Axys' legal
and financial advisors to continue negotiations with Applera. 

    Beginning
in the week of June 3, the respective financial advisors and legal counsel for Axys and Applera reviewed and negotiated the detailed terms of a definitive merger
agreement to govern the strategic combination of the parties and Applera continued to conduct its due diligence review of Axys' business throughout the week. Tony L. White, Applera's Chairman and
Chief Executive Officer, and Peter Chambr, Chief Operating Officer of the Celera Genomics group, met with Mr. Hastings on June 7, and Dr. Venuti met with
Dr. Craig Venter, President and Chief Scientific Officer of the Celera Genomics group on June 10, to discuss the possible strategic transaction. The board of directors of Axys discussed
the proposed terms of the merger, including exchange ratio and other material terms, with legal counsel and representatives from JPMorgan H&Q at special meetings held on the evenings of June 10
and 11. During each of these meetings, members of the law firm of Latham & Watkins, outside counsel to Axys, reviewed with the directors their fiduciary duties. At the conclusion of each
meeting, the board of directors instructed management to continue proceeding toward reaching a final definitive agreement with Applera. 

    During
the period that Axys was providing due diligence materials to Applera, and Applera and Axys were negotiating a potential strategic combination, Axys was also providing due
diligence information to another potential strategic party. In addition, Axys and its financial and legal advisors were negotiating the terms for a potential merger with this second party. The status
and terms of this alternative merger proposal were reviewed and discussed by the Axys board members during the board meetings held on May 14, May 17, May 23, June 1,
June 10 and June 11, and during each of the meetings, the Axys board of directors instructed management to continue to pursue this potential merger transaction concurrently with their
discussions with Applera. 

    The
Axys board of directors believes that Axys' success to date and ongoing value are attributable to Axys' base of highly-qualified and experienced scientific employees. The Axys
board of directors had significant concerns regarding Axys' ability to retain these very talented and sought after employees through the closing of a potential merger with this second party, and
failing this retention, concerns 

that the potential merger might fail to close. In this regard, Axys was only to be given limited freedom by the second party to offer financial incentives to Axys' employees to ensure that they would
remain with Axys through the closing of the transaction. Axys believed that Axys would have an increased ability to retain its employees through the closing of the merger with the Applera affiliate
due to the willingness of Applera to permit Axys to provide certain incentives to Axys' employees, as well as the current business practices of the Celera Genomics group, both of which were more
compatible with the approach of Axys. In addition, the second party wanted to strictly limit Axys' ability to amend and extend its existing collaboration agreements and enter into similar agreements
for non-sponsored research and development programs prior to the closing of a merger. Applera was willing to provide Axys with more flexibility in this regard as continued partnering has
been and is expected to be generally consistent with the business practices of the Celera Genomics group. The board of directors noted that Axys' existing and planned collaboration agreements were an
integral part of Axys' financial planning, and the elimination of these initiatives would meaningfully reduce Axys' sources of revenue and liquidity. The board of directors concluded that if the
merger with this second party failed to close due to a failure to retain employees or some other reason, Axys' ability to continue its operations
would be hampered significantly if it could not pursue its collaboration initiatives during the pre-closing period. Concerns about the certainty of closing the merger, in addition to
concerns about the ongoing financial strength of Axys in the event the merger did not close, led the board of directors to conclude in its June 11 meeting that the Applera transaction, which
offered Axys greater flexibility in these areas of concern, was superior to the proposal from the second party. Immediately following the board meeting on June 11, and again during the
afternoon and evening of June 12, Axys and its financial advisor invited the second party to revise its proposal to address these and other concerns. As of the evening of June 12, 2001,
Axys had not received a new proposal from the second party that addressed the board of directors' concerns. 

    At
a special meeting of the board of directors of Applera held by telephone on the afternoon of June 12, 2001 and attended by Morgan Stanley & Co. Incorporated,
financial advisor to Applera, and Applera's legal counsel, Simpson Thacher & Bartlett, the board of directors reviewed and discussed the proposed terms of the merger transaction with Axys. The
Applera board of directors approved the terms of the merger and delegated authority to certain members of senior management to finalize and enter into a definitive merger agreement. 

    At
a special meeting of the Axys board of directors held on the evening of June 12, 2001 and attended by JPMorgan H&Q and Axys' legal counsel, Latham & Watkins and
Richards, Layton & Finger, the board of directors reviewed and discussed the final definitive Applera merger agreement. Axys' legal counsel reviewed with the members of the Axys board of
directors their fiduciary duties relating to the proposed transaction with Applera. Also at this meeting, JPMorgan H&Q reviewed its financial analysis of the exchange ratio provided for in the
transaction and delivered to the Axys board of directors its oral opinion (which opinion was confirmed by a written opinion dated June 12, 2001) to the effect that, as of the date provided in
the opinion, and based on and subject to the matters described in the opinion, the exchange ratio provided for in the transaction was fair, from a financial point of view, to holders of Axys' common
stock. See "The MergerOpinion of the Financial Advisor to the Axys Board of Directors" in this proxy statement/prospectus for more information about the opinion delivered by JPMorgan H&Q.
The opinion is attached as Annex B to this proxy statement/prospectus. JPMorgan H&Q expressed no opinion as to the fairness of the offer from the second party nor did it make a recommendation to
pursue one transaction over any other. At the conclusion of the meeting, the board of directors unanimously determined that the Applera merger was fair to and in the best interests of Axys'
stockholders and approved the definitive merger agreement. The merger agreement was executed later that night, and the transaction was announced in a joint press release on the morning of
June 13, 2001. 

 Reasons of Axys for the Merger  

    The Axys board of directors, in consultation with its financial and legal advisors, carefully considered the terms and conditions of the merger agreement and
the proposed merger. The Axys board of
directors unanimously determined that the merger of Axys pursuant to the terms of the merger agreement is in the best interests of Axys' stockholders, unanimously approved the merger agreement and the
merger and unanimously recommended that the stockholders of Axys vote to approve and adopt the merger agreement and approve the merger. 

    In
reaching its unanimous decision to approve the merger agreement, the Axys board of directors considered a number of positive factors, including the following: 


the
Celera Genomics group's strong capabilities in the areas of genomics, proteomics, bioinformatics and high throughput computation combined with Axys'
complementary strengths in the areas of medicinal, structural and combinatorial chemistry and biology would enable the combined company to more effectively pursue the research and development of
innovative small molecule therapeutics;


the
combined company's enhanced ability to identify a high volume of new therapeutic targets, select the best targets from among them and develop new drugs
to intervene with the targets;


the
opportunity for Axys' stockholders to participate in a larger and better capitalized organization and to benefit from the potential appreciation in
Celera Genomics common stock;


the
opportunity for holders of Axys common stock to receive a significant premium over the existing market price for shares of Axys' common stock prior to
the announcement of the merger;


the
greater liquidity of Celera Genomics common stock and broader analyst coverage;


the
increased ability of Axys to access capital for research and development;


the
scientific renown of the Celera Genomics group and its access to cutting-edge technologies, including technologies from the Applied
Biosystems group;


the
opinion of the financial advisor to the Axys board of directors that, as of June 12, 2001, and subject to the assumptions and limitations set
forth in the fairness opinion, the exchange ratio was fair, from a financial point of view, to the holders of the outstanding shares of Axys' common stock, and the financial presentation made by Axys'
financial advisor to the board of directors in connection with the delivery of its opinion;


the
fact that with the assistance of its financial advisor Axys had engaged in a review of the available alternatives for strategic and financial
transactions, and the fact that the Axys board of directors had concluded that Applera was the best available alternative for Axys for a strategic combination;


the
ability of Axys to terminate the merger agreement upon receipt of a superior acquisition proposal, subject to the payment of specified customary
termination fees;


the
fact that the parties intended for the merger to qualify as a tax-free transaction for United States federal income tax purposes (except
for tax resulting from any cash received for fractional shares by the holders of Axys common stock) which would permit Axys' stockholders to receive Celera Genomics common stock in a
tax-free exchange;


the
belief that Axys would have an increased ability to retain its employees through the closing of the merger due to the willingness of Applera to permit
Axys to provide certain incentives to Axys' employees, as well as the current business practices of the Celera Genomics group, both of which were more compatible with the approach of Axys than were
proposed alternatives; 


the
likely impact of the merger on Axys' employees;


the
belief that Axys and the Celera Genomics group have complementary cultures and that Axys would be able to retain its scientific employees through the
closing of the transaction;


the
limited conditions to closing and likelihood of closing the transaction;


the
extensive negotiation process undertaken before the signing of the merger agreement;


the
expected effect of the merger on Axys' existing relationships with third-party collaborators; and


the
fact that Axys' strategy of extending existing collaboration agreements as well as pursuing additional collaboration agreements was consistent with the
strategy of the Celera Genomics group. 

    The
Axys board of directors also considered a number of potentially negative factors in its deliberations concerning the merger, including: 


the
risk that the merger would not be completed in a timely manner or at all, or, if completed, that the benefits sought in the merger would not be
achieved;


the
risk that the average closing price of Celera Genomics common stock during the 10-day period ending two business days prior to closing will
decline below $34.33, the level below which there will be no further adjustment to the exchange ratio, so that the market price of the Celera Genomics common stock to be received by holders of Axys
common stock will be less than $4.65 per share of Axys common stock;


that
the market value of Celera Genomics common stock may decline after the closing of the merger;


the
substantial management time and effort that will be required to consummate the merger and integrate the operations of the two companies;


the
possibility that certain provisions in the merger agreement would likely have the effect of discouraging other persons potentially interested in
merging with Axys from pursuing the opportunity; and


the
other risks and uncertainties discussed above under "Risk Factors." 

    The
Axys board of directors believes that these negative risks are outweighed by the potential benefits to be gained by the merger. 

    The
foregoing discussion of the information and factors considered by the board of directors of Axys is not intended to be exhaustive. In view of the wide variety of the factors
considered by the board of directors in evaluating the merger and the complexity of these matters, the board of directors of Axys did not find it practicable to, and did not, quantify or otherwise
attempt to assign any relative weight to the various factors considered. In considering the factors described above, individual members of the board of directors of Axys may have given different
weight to different factors. 

Recommendation of the Axys Board of Directors  

    After careful consideration, and in light of the factors described under the heading "Reasons for the MergerAxys," the Axys board of
directors has unanimously determined that the merger agreement is advisable, and that the merger and the consideration to be paid to the holders of Axys' common stock in the merger are fair to, and in
the best interests of, the holders of Axys' common stock. Accordingly, the Axys board of directors has unanimously approved the merger agreement and the merger, and unanimously recommends that the
holders of Axys' common stock entitled to vote at 

the special meeting vote FOR the proposal to approve and adopt the merger agreement and approve the merger. 

Reasons of Applera for the Merger  

    In evaluating the proposed merger, the Applera board of directors reviewed presentations from its management and advisors, including the advice of its
financial advisor, Morgan Stanley and Co. Incorporated. In reaching its determination to approve the merger agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, the Applera board of directors
considered a number of factors, including the factors listed below. 


The
board of directors' belief that the technology, expertise and infrastructure that would be acquired in the proposed acquisition of Axys would assist
the Celera Genomics group in achieving its strategic goal of expanding its business in drug discovery and development. Specifically, the board of directors believes that combining the Celera Genomics
group's target discovery programs with Axys' small molecule lead identification and optimization capabilities could lead to the development of new therapeutic products.


The
board of directors' belief that Axys' highly-qualified and experienced scientific employees will be compatible with those of the Celera Genomics group
and that the two organizations have complementary cultures.


The
board of directors' belief that the complementary technology, research programs and products of the Celera Genomics group and Axys could be combined in
a manner that would expand and accelerate the ability of Axys and the Celera Genomics group to identify innovative new therapies. Specifically, the board believes that Axys' capabilities to identify
candidates for small molecule therapeutics can be used to address the pipeline of new targets being created by the Celera Genomics group in its research programs.


The
board of directors' belief that the combination of capabilities of Axys and the Celera Genomics group would provide increased opportunities for revenue
growth through new and accelerated internal and collaborative therapeutic discovery and development programs.


The
board of directors' belief that a business combination with Axys would provide opportunities beyond those available in a reasonable time frame through
internal growth by permitting the Celera Genomics group to acquire technical capabilities, capacity infrastructure, people and expertise that will provide a base from which the combined business could
accelerate development of therapeutics.


The
board of directors' determination that the terms and conditions of the merger agreement, including the form and amount of consideration and the
representations, warranties, covenants and conditions contained in the agreement, are in the best interests of Applera.

of the foregoing factors or groups of factors had particular prominence in the decision of the Applera board of directors to approve the merger agreement and the transactions
contemplated thereby, and none was assigned any specific or relative weight. 

Opinion of the Financial Advisor to the Axys Board of Directors  

    The board of directors of Axys retained JPMorgan H&Q, a division of J.P. Morgan Securities Inc., as its financial advisor in connection with the
proposed merger. 

    The full text of the definitive written JPMorgan H&Q opinion, dated June 12, 2001, which sets forth the assumptions made, the procedures followed, the matters considered and
the limitations on the scope of the review undertaken by JPMorgan H&Q in rendering its opinion is attached as Annex B to this proxy statement/prospectus. Holders of Axys common stock are urged to read
the JPMorgan H&Q opinion carefully and in its entirety. The JPMorgan H&Q opinion only addresses the fairness of the exchange ratio provided in the merger agreement, from a financial point of view, to
the holders of common stock of Axys as of the date of the JPMorgan H&Q opinion, and does not constitute a recommendation to any stockholder of Axys as to how the stockholder should vote at the special
meeting. 

    At
the meeting of the board of directors of Axys on June 12, 2001, JPMorgan H&Q rendered its oral opinion to the board of directors of Axys that, as of such date, the exchange
ratio provided in the merger agreement, as defined in the merger agreement, was fair, from a financial point of view, to the holders of common stock of Axys. JPMorgan H&Q has confirmed its
June 12, 2001 oral opinion by delivering its written opinion, dated June 12, 2001, to the board of directors of Axys, that, as of such date, the exchange ratio provided in the merger
agreement was fair, from a financial point of view, to the holders of common stock of Axys. No limitations were imposed by the board of directors of Axys upon JPMorgan H&Q with respect to the
investigations made or procedures followed by it in rendering its opinion. 

    In
arriving at its opinion, JPMorgan H&Q (1) reviewed a draft of the merger agreement, dated June 11, 2001; (2) reviewed certain publicly available business and
financial information concerning Axys and the Celera Genomics group, and the industries in which they operate; (3) compared the proposed financial terms of the merger with the publicly
available financial terms of certain transactions involving companies JPMorgan H&Q deemed relevant and the consideration received for such companies; (4) compared the financial and operating
performance of Axys and the Celera Genomics group with publicly available information concerning certain other companies it deemed relevant and reviewed the current and historical market prices of the
common stock of Axys and Celera Genomics common stock and certain publicly traded securities of such other companies; (5) reviewed certain internal financial analyses and forecasts prepared by
the management of Axys relating to its business; and (6) performed such other financial studies and analyses and considered such other information as it deemed appropriate for the purposes of
its opinion. 

    In
giving its opinion, JPMorgan H&Q relied upon and assumed, without independent verification, the accuracy and completeness of all information that was publicly available or was
furnished to it by Axys and Applera or otherwise reviewed by it, and JPMorgan H&Q has not assumed any responsibility or liability therefor. JPMorgan H&Q has not conducted any valuation or appraisal of
any assets or liabilities, nor have any such valuations or appraisals been provided to it. In relying on financial analyses and forecasts provided to it, JPMorgan H&Q has assumed that they have been
reasonably prepared based on assumptions reflecting the best currently available estimates and judgments by management and its representatives as to the expected future results of operations and
financial condition of Axys and the Celera Genomics group to which such analyses or forecasts relate. JPMorgan
H&Q has also assumed that the merger will qualify as a tax-free reorganization for United States federal income tax purposes, that the merger will be accounted for as a purchase, and that
the other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement will be consummated as described in the merger agreement. JPMorgan H&Q has relied as to all legal matters relevant to rendering its opinion
upon the advice of counsel. JPMorgan H&Q has also assumed that the definitive merger agreement did not differ in any material respects from the draft thereof furnished to it. JPMorgan H&Q has further
assumed that all material governmental, regulatory or other consents and approvals necessary for the consummation of the merger will be obtained without any adverse effect on Axys, the Celera Genomics
group or the Applera or on the contemplated benefits of the merger. 

    JPMorgan H&Q also held discussions with certain members of the management of Axys with respect to certain aspects of the merger, and the past and current business operations of Axys
and the Celera Genomics group, the financial condition and future prospects and operations of Axys and the Celera Genomics group, the effects of the merger on the financial condition and future
prospects of Axys and the Celera Genomics group, and certain other matters it believed necessary or appropriate to its inquiry. 

    The
opinion of JPMorgan H&Q is necessarily based on economic, market and other conditions as in effect on, and the information made available to it as of June 12, 2001. It
should be understood that subsequent developments may affect this opinion and that JPMorgan H&Q does not have any obligation to update, revise, or reaffirm this opinion. For purposes of its opinion,
JPMorgan H&Q was not asked to consider, and its opinion does not address, the relative merits of the merger as compared to any alternative business strategy that might exist for Axys or of the effect
of any other business combinations in which Axys might engage. The opinion of JPMorgan H&Q is limited to the fairness, from a financial point of view, to the holders of common stock of Axys of the
exchange ratio in the proposed merger, based upon the trading price of Celera Genomics common stock as of June 11, 2001, and it expresses no opinion as to the underlying decision by Axys to
engage in the merger. JPMorgan H&Q expressed no opinion therein as to the price at which Celera Genomics common stock will trade at any future time. 

    The
projections furnished to JPMorgan H&Q for Axys were prepared by the management of Axys. Axys does not publicly disclose internal management projections of the type provided to
JPMorgan H&Q in connection with JPMorgan H&Q's analysis of the transaction, and such projections were not prepared with a view toward public disclosure. These projections were based on numerous
variables and assumptions that are inherently uncertain and may be beyond the control of management, including, without limitation, factors related to general economic and competitive conditions and
prevailing interest rates. Accordingly, actual results could vary significantly from those set forth in such projections. 

    In
accordance with customary investment banking practice, JPMorgan H&Q employed generally accepted valuation methods in reaching its opinion. The following is a summary of the
material financial analyses utilized by JPMorgan H&Q in connection with providing its opinion. 

    Historical Price and Premium Analysis.
  JPMorgan H&Q calculated the implied premium over the closing price of the common

    Public Trading Multiples.
  Using publicly available information, JPMorgan H&Q compared selected employee data of Axys
with similar data for comparable companies which JPMorgan H&Q judged to be of a similar employee business to Axys. The companies selected by JPMorgan H&Q were Array BioPharma, Inc., Medichem
Life Sciences, Inc. and Albany Molecular Research, Inc. These 

companies were selected, among other reasons, because of their operational and organizational similarities with Axys. For each comparable company, JPMorgan H&Q determined the number of chemists and
Ph.D.'s as of June 2001. JPMorgan H&Q calculated the multiples of enterprise value (enterprise value equals market value plus net debt) to the number of chemists and Ph.D.'s at each comparable
company. These resulting median multiples were then applied to Axys' number of chemists and Ph.D.'s, yielding implied enterprise values that were then used to calculate implied equity values per share
for Axys. JPMorgan H&Q, in its judgment, used the following results of such calculations:

    Discounted Future Value Analysis.
  Using publicly available information, JPMorgan H&Q compared selected financial data
of Axys with similar data for selected publicly traded healthcare companies with near-term sales engaged in businesses which JPMorgan H&Q judged to be similar to Axys' business. The
companies selected by JPMorgan H&Q were Aviron, ImClone Systems Incorporated, The Medicines Company, Praecis Pharmaceuticals Incorporated and Scios Inc. These companies were selected, among
other reasons, because of their operational, organizational and overall business similarities with Axys and because each company is expected to have near-term sales. For each comparable
company, Wall Street projections for CY2002 and CY2003 revenues were measured as well as current equity values. JPMorgan H&Q calculated the current enterprise values for each company and used such
values to calculate multiples of enterprise value to CY2002 and CY2003 revenues. JPMorgan H&Q selected the applicable median multiple and applied it to the projected CY2007 and CY2008 revenues for
Axys as provided by management of Axys in order to calculate the future enterprise value of Axys. The resulting enterprise values were discounted back to the current year. JPMorgan H&Q then calculated
equity values per share for Axys. JPMorgan H&Q, in its judgment, used the following results of such calculations:

    JPMorgan
H&Q also compared selected financial data of Axys with similar data for selected publicly traded healthcare companies with current sales engaged in businesses which JPMorgan
H&Q judged to be similar to Axys' business. The companies selected by JPMorgan H&Q were Celgene, Cephalon, COR Therapeutics and QLT Inc. These companies were selected, among other reasons,
because of their operational, organizational and overall business similarities with Axys and because each company has current sales. For each comparable company, Wall Street projections for CY2001 and
CY2002 revenues were measured as well as current equity values. JPMorgan H&Q calculated the current enterprise values for each company and used such values to calculate multiples of enterprise value
to CY2001 and CY2002 revenues. JPMorgan H&Q selected the applicable median multiple and applied it to the projected CY2008 and CY2009 revenues for Axys as provided by management of Axys in order to
calculate the future enterprise value of Axys. The resulting enterprise values were 

discounted back to the current year. JPMorgan H&Q then calculated equity values per share for Axys. JPMorgan H&Q, in its judgment, used the following results of such calculations:

June 11, 2001, of $4.65. 

    Historical Trading Price Analysis.
  JPMorgan H&Q reviewed and analyzed the historical closing prices for the common
stock of Axys for the 12 month period ending June 11, 2001. JPMorgan H&Q observed the following values for the trading price of the common stock of Axys:

historical closing prices for the common stock of Axys for the six months ended June 11, 2001. JPMorgan H&Q compared the six month range of $2.19 to $6.47 to the offer price in the proposed
merger, as of June 11, 2001, of $4.65. 

    The
summary set forth above does not purport to be a complete description of the analyses or data presented by JPMorgan H&Q. The preparation of a fairness opinion is a complex process
and is not necessarily susceptible to partial analysis or summary description. JPMorgan H&Q believes that the summary set forth above and its analyses must be considered as a whole and that selecting
portions thereof, without considering all of its analyses, could create an incomplete view of the processes underlying its analyses and opinion. JPMorgan H&Q based its analyses on assumptions that it
deemed reasonable, including assumptions concerning general business and economic conditions and industry-specific factors. The other principal assumptions upon which JPMorgan H&Q based its analyses
are set forth above under the description of each such analysis. JPMorgan H&Q's analyses are not necessarily indicative of actual values or actual future results that might be achieved, which values
may be higher or lower than those indicated. Moreover, JPMorgan H&Q's analyses are not and do not purport to be appraisals or otherwise reflective of the prices at which businesses actually could be
bought or sold. 

    As
a part of its investment banking business, JPMorgan H&Q and its affiliates are continually engaged in the valuation of businesses and their securities in connection with mergers
and acquisitions, investments for passive and control purposes, negotiated underwritings, secondary distributions of listed and unlisted securities, private placements, and valuations for estate,
corporate and other purposes. JPMorgan H&Q was selected to advise the board of directors of Axys with respect to the merger on the basis of such experience and its familiarity with Axys. 

    For
services rendered in connection with the merger, Axys has agreed to pay JPMorgan H&Q a customary fee. In addition, Axys has agreed to reimburse JPMorgan H&Q for its expenses
incurred in connection with its services, including the fees and disbursements of counsel, and will indemnify JPMorgan H&Q against certain liabilities, including liabilities arising under the federal
securities laws. Previously, JPMorgan H&Q has provided investment banking and other financial advisory services to Axys, including as a manager in a public offering of securities in 1996, and has
received fees for rendering these services. 

    In the ordinary course of their businesses, JPMorgan H&Q and its affiliates may actively trade the debt and equity securities of Axys, or Applera for their own accounts or for the
accounts of customers and, accordingly, they may at any time hold long or short positions in such securities. 

Structure of the Merger  

    If all conditions to the merger are satisfied or waived in accordance with the merger agreement, Angel Acquisition, a direct, wholly owned subsidiary of
Applera, will merge with and into Axys, with Axys continuing as the surviving corporation. Following the merger, Axys will be a wholly owned subsidiary of Applera. After the merger, Axys will be
integrated into the research and development and business operations of the Celera Genomics group. 

Closing Matters  

    Closing.
  The closing of the merger will take place on the second business day after all closing conditions have been
satisfied or waived, unless the merger agreement has been terminated or another time or date is agreed to in writing by the parties. See "Conditions to the Merger" for a more complete
description of the conditions that must be satisfied prior to closing. 

    Effective Time.
  On the closing date of the merger, Applera and Axys will file a certificate of merger agreement
in accordance with the Delaware General Corporation Law and make all other required filings or recordings. The merger will become effective when the certificate of merger is duly filed or at such
later time as is permissible in accordance with the Delaware General Corporation Law and as Axys and Applera agree and specify in the certificate of merger. 

    Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws.
  The merger agreement provides that the restated certificate of incorporation
of Axys will be the certificate of incorporation of the surviving corporation, and the bylaws of Angel Acquisition will be the bylaws of the surviving corporation. 

    Directors and Officers.
  The merger agreement provides that the directors of Angel Acquisition at the effective time of
the merger will be the directors of the surviving corporation, and that the officers of Axys at the effective time will be the officers of the surviving corporation. 

Consideration to Be Received in the Merger  

    The merger agreement provides that, at the effective time of the merger, each share of Axys common stock will be exchanged for a fraction of a share of Celera
Genomics common stock and associated rights. This number is referred to as the "exchange ratio." The exchange ratio will be determined as follows: 


if
the 10-day average closing price of a share of Celera Genomics common stock immediately preceding (but excluding) the second trading day
prior to the closing date of the merger is equal to or greater than $45.77 and less than or equal to $48.23, the fraction will be 0.1016 shares, or $4.65 divided by $45.77, the 10-day
average closing price of a share of Celera Genomics common stock immediately preceding (but excluding) the second trading day prior to the signing of the merger agreement;


if
the 10-day average closing price of a share of Celera Genomics common stock immediately preceding (but excluding) the second trading day
prior to the closing date of the merger is greater than $48.23 and less than or equal to $60.29, the fraction will be $4.90 divided by this 10-day average closing price;


if
the 10-day average closing price of a share of Celera Genomics common stock immediately preceding (but excluding) the second trading day
prior to the closing date of the merger is greater than $60.29, the fraction will be fixed at 0.0813 shares; 


if
the 10-day average closing price of a share of Celera Genomics common stock immediately preceding (but excluding) the second trading day
prior to the closing date of the merger is less than $45.77 and greater than or equal to $34.33, the fraction will be $4.65 divided by this 10-day average closing price; and


if
the 10-day average closing price of a share of Celera Genomics common stock immediately preceding (but excluding) the second trading day
prior to the closing date of the merger is less than $34.33, the fraction will be fixed at 0.1355 shares. 

    The
merger agreement also provides that, at the effective time of the merger, each share of Axys common stock held in the treasury of Axys or owned by Applera or Angel Acquisition
will be canceled and retired without any cash or other consideration delivered with respect to such share. 

    At
the time of the special meeting, Axys stockholders will not necessarily know the exact number or the exact market price of the Celera Genomics common stock that will be issued in
connection with the merger. The number of shares of Celera Genomics common stock that will be received for each share of Axys common stock will be calculated using the exchange ratio formula described
above, and will vary accordingly based on the trading price of Celera Genomics common stock after the special meeting. Stockholders of Axys are urged to obtain current market quotations for Celera
Genomics common stock prior to the date of the special meeting. No assurance can be given as to the market price of Celera Genomics common stock at any time prior to or on the effective date of the
merger. 

Treatment of Axys Stock Options  

    The merger agreement provides that, after the effective time of the merger, each outstanding option to purchase Axys common stock granted prior to the
effective time of the merger under Axys' stock option plans, whether vested or unvested, will be assumed by Applera at the effective time and converted into an option to purchase shares of Celera
Genomics common stock under the same terms and conditions as were applicable to the options as granted under the option plan and form of option agreement under which it was issued. To the extent
permitted by law, Applera will comply with the terms of the relevant Axys stock option plans applicable to the options and will ensure that the stock options which qualified as incentive stock options
prior to the effective time of the merger continue to qualify as incentive stock options after the merger. 

    The
number of shares of Celera Genomics common stock that each converted option will be exercisable for will be equal to the number of shares of Axys common stock subject to such
options prior to the merger multiplied by the exchange ratio, rounded down to the nearest whole share, and the exercise price for each share under the option will be a price per share equal to the
exercise price per share prior to the merger divided by the exchange ratio, rounded up to the nearest whole cent, provided that in no event will the option exercise price for options held by Axys
employees or consultants be higher than the closing price of a share of Celera Genomics common stock on the date immediately prior to the closing of the merger. Within 10 business days after the
effective time of the merger, Applera will deliver notices to the holders of Axys stock options, stating that the option has been converted pursuant to the merger and setting forth the number of
shares of Celera Genomics common stock for which such converted options shall be exercisable, as well as the applicable exercise price for such converted options. 

    For
a further discussion of the treatment of Axys stock options and the Axys employee benefit plans under the merger agreement, see "Effect on Employee Benefits, Stock
Plan and Stock Options" in this proxy statement/prospectus. 

Exchange of Certificates in the Merger  

    BankBoston, N.A., in its capacity as exchange agent of Celera Genomics common stock, will handle the exchange of Axys stock certificates for stock certificates
of Celera Genomics common stock and the payment of cash for fractional shares. Soon after the closing of the merger, the exchange agent will send a letter of transmittal, which is to be used to
exchange Axys stock certificates for stock certificates of Celera Genomics common stock, to each former Axys stockholder. The letter of transmittal will contain instructions explaining the procedure
for surrendering Axys stock certificates. 
You should not return certificates with the enclosed proxy card.

    Axys
stockholders who surrender their stock certificates, together with a properly completed letter of transmittal, will receive stock certificates representing the shares of Celera
Genomics common stock into which their shares of Axys common stock were converted in the merger. After the merger, each certificate previously representing shares of Axys common stock will only
represent the right to receive the shares of Celera Genomics common stock into which those shares of Axys common stock have been converted (and cash in lieu of fractional shares). 

    Applera
will not pay dividends or make any other distributions with respect to Celera Genomics common stock to holders of any Axys stock certificates until the Axys stock certificates
are surrendered. However, once those certificates are surrendered, Applera will pay to the holder, without interest, any dividends or other distributions that may have been declared after the
effective time of the merger on the shares of Celera Genomics common stock into which those Axys shares have been converted. After the effective time of the merger, Axys will not register any
transfers of shares of Axys common stock. 

Fractional Shares  

    No fractional shares of Celera Genomics common stock will be issued in the merger. Instead, Applera will deposit with BankBoston, N.A., the exchange agent, any
cash payable in lieu of fractional shares of Celera Genomics common stock. From the deposited funds, the exchange agent will pay each of those former Axys stockholders who would have otherwise been
entitled to a fractional share of Celera Genomics common stock an amount in cash determined by multiplying the fractional share interest to which the holder would otherwise be entitled by the average
of the closing prices of a share of Celera Genomics common stock on the New York Stock Exchange Composite Transactions Tape on each of the 10 consecutive trading days immediately preceding (but
excluding) the second trading day prior to the closing date of the merger. 

Effect on Axys Convertible Notes and Warrants  

    Applera has agreed to become jointly and severally liable with Axys for the payment and performance by Axys of all of its obligations under the convertible
notes issued by Axys and the related indenture and note purchase agreements and warrants to purchase Axys common stock. After the merger, each convertible note outstanding at the effective time of the
merger will become convertible into the number of shares of Celera Genomics common stock that would have been received for the note if the note had been converted immediately prior to the merger. 

    The
merger agreement provides that at the effective time of the merger, subject to limited exceptions, each outstanding unexercised warrant to purchase Axys common stock will be
converted into a warrant to purchase shares of Celera Genomics common stock under the same terms and conditions as applied to the Axys warrant. Each warrant shall be exercisable for the number of
shares of Celera Genomics common stock the holder of the warrant would have been entitled to receive in the merger if the warrant had been exercised immediately prior to the merger. The exercise price
under the warrant will be a price per share equal to the total exercise price for all shares of Axys common stock that were purchasable under the warrant immediately prior to the merger divided by the 

number of full shares of Celera Genomics common stock that are purchasable under the warrant immediately after the merger. 

Representations and Warranties

    Axys
has also agreed to notify Applera if any employee at or above a specified level of seniority gives Axys notice of his or her intention to terminate his or her employment with
Axys, so that Applera may meet with the employee. 

    Conduct of Business by Applera Pending Closing.
  Until the closing of the merger (or the termination of the merger
agreement prior to the closing of the merger), Applera has agreed not to declare or pay any dividend on or split, combine or reclassify any Celera Genomics common stock prior to the effective time of
the merger or issue or authorize the issuance of any equity interest in substitution for shares of Celera Genomics common stock. 

    Additional Reciprocal Covenants Relating to Conduct of Business Pending the Merger.
  Both Axys and Applera have agreed
to some specific restrictions that prohibit them from: 


taking
actions that would prevent or impede the merger from qualifying as a tax-free reorganization for tax purposes;


taking
actions that, if taken on or prior to the date of the merger agreement, would have resulted in any of the representations and warranties set forth
in the merger agreement being untrue;


taking
actions that would or reasonably might be expected to result in any of the conditions to closing not being satisfied; or


issuing
press releases or other public statements with respect to the merger or the merger agreement without the other party's prior consent. 

    Recommendation of Axys Board of Directors.
  The Axys board of directors has agreed to recommend that its stockholders
approve and adopt the merger agreement and approve the merger. The Axys board of directors may withdraw or modify its recommendation of the merger in a manner adverse to Applera only if Axys receives
a "superior proposal" as described below under "No Solicitation" in this proxy statement/prospectus. 

    No Solicitation.
  Axys has agreed that it will not (whether directly or indirectly through advisors, agents or other
intermediaries), nor will it or its subsidiaries authorize or permit any of their officers, directors, agents, representatives, advisors or subsidiaries, to: 


solicit,
initiate or take any action knowingly to facilitate the submission of inquiries, proposals or offers with respect to a third party "transaction
proposal" of the type described below;


enter
into or participate in any discussions or negotiations regarding a transaction proposal;


furnish
to any third party any nonpublic information with respect to its business, properties or assets in connection with any transaction proposal; or


otherwise
knowingly assist or participate in, cooperate with, facilitate or encourage, any effort or attempt by any third party to do any of the foregoing. 

    A
"transaction proposal" is any proposal or offer, other than the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, with respect to: 


any
acquisition or purchase of 15% or more of the consolidated assets of Axys and its subsidiaries or of over 15% of any class of equity securities of Axys
or its subsidiaries;


any
tender offer, including a self tender offer, or exchange offer that if consummated would result in any person beneficially owning 15% or more of any
class of equity securities of Axys or its subsidiaries; or


any
merger, consolidation, business combination, sale of substantially all of the assets, recapitalization, liquidation, dissolution or similar transaction
involving Axys or any of its subsidiaries whose assets, individually or in the aggregate, constitute more than 15% of the consolidated assets of Axys. 

    In
the event a third party has made a bona fide transaction proposal that could result in a "superior proposal" of the type described below and the Axys board of directors concludes
in good 

faith, upon consultation with outside counsel, that the failure to take such action would violate the fiduciary duties of the board of directors of Axys to its stockholders, then Axys may: 


furnish
to the third party information relating to Axys' business under an appropriate confidentiality letter on terms no less favorable to Axys than those
in place with Applera concerning Axys and its business, properties or assets;


engage
in negotiations or discussions with the third party;


comply
with its obligations under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 with respect to the transaction proposal; and


withdraw
its recommendation that the stockholders of Axys approve and adopt the merger agreement and approve the merger. 

    A
"superior proposal" is any proposal, other than the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, with respect to: 


any
acquisition or purchase of 50% or more of the consolidated assets of Axys and its subsidiaries or of over 50% of any class of equity securities of Axys
or its subsidiaries;


any
tender offer, including a self tender offer, or exchange offer that if consummated would result in any person beneficially owning 50% or more of any
class of equity securities of Axys or its subsidiaries; or


any
merger, consolidation, business combination, sale of substantially all of the assets, recapitalization, liquidation, dissolution or similar transaction
involving Axys or any of its subsidiaries whose assets, individually or in the aggregate, constitute more than 50% of the consolidated assets of Axys or its subsidiaries, 

if,
in each case, the board of directors of Axys has concluded in good faith, after consultation with its outside legal counsel and its financial advisor(s), that the proposal is reasonably capable of
being completed and represents a financially superior transaction for holders of Axys common stock compared to the merger under the merger agreement. 

    The
merger agreement requires Axys to promptly inform Applera of all material terms and conditions of any transaction proposal (including any superior proposal) it receives and to
keep Applera informed on a prompt and current basis of the status, terms and content of any discussions regarding any transaction proposal. 

    Rights Agreement.
  The Axys board of directors has agreed to take all action necessary in order to render its
stockholder rights agreement inapplicable to the merger and other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement. Further, the Axys board of directors has agreed not to otherwise amend the rights
agreement or take any action with respect to, or make any determination under, the rights agreement without the prior written consent of Applera. 

    Reasonable Best Efforts.
  Applera and Axys have agreed to cooperate with each other and to use their reasonable best
efforts to take all actions and do all things advisable or necessary under applicable laws to complete the merger and the other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement. This cooperation
includes obtaining all regulatory consents and approvals necessary to complete the merger and defending any lawsuits or other proceedings challenging the merger agreement. However, Applera and Axys
will not be required to make any disposition of or enter into any agreement to hold separate any subsidiary, assets or business, or take any other action that Applera determines could significantly
reduce the value of Axys or the benefits that Applera expects to derive from the merger and Axys and its subsidiaries have agreed not to take any of these actions without Applera's prior written
consent. Additionally, Axys and its subsidiaries will not agree to take any of the above actions without the prior written consent of Applera. 

    Accountants Letter.
  Axys will also use its reasonable best efforts to deliver to Applera a comfort letter from
Ernst & Young LLP in a form and substance reasonably satisfactory to Applera prior to the effective date of the Form S-4. 

    Access to Information; Confidentiality.
  Axys will provide Applera and its representatives reasonable access during
normal business hours to Axys' properties, books, contracts, commitments, personnel and records, and will provide Applera with all information concerning its business, properties, financial condition,
operations and personnel and a copy of each report, schedule, registration statement or
other document filed by it as Applera may reasonably request. Applera and Axys will keep all non-public information confidential. 

Conditions to the Merger  

    Axys' and Applera's respective obligations to complete the merger are subject to the satisfaction or, to the extent permissible, the waiver of various
conditions that include, in addition to other customary closing conditions: 


holders
of a majority of the outstanding shares of Axys will have voted to approve and adopt the merger agreement and approve the merger;


the
applicable waiting periods under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act will have expired or terminated;


there
will not be any order, injunction or other legal restraint prohibiting completion of the merger;


the
registration statement on Form S-4, of which this proxy statement/prospectus is a part, will have been declared effective by the
Securities and Exchange Commission and no stop order suspending its effectiveness will have been issued and there will not be any proceedings seeking a stop order and material blue sky and other state
securities law will have been complied with;


the
shares of Celera Genomics common stock issued in the merger and reserved for issuance upon exercise of Axys' stock option, warrants and convertible
notes will have been approved for listing on the New York Stock Exchange; and


each
party will have received an opinion of its legal counsel to the effect that the merger will qualify as a tax-free reorganization under
Section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code and that each of Applera, Axys and Angel Acquisition will be a party to the reorganization. 

    In
addition, each party's obligation to complete the merger is subject to the satisfaction of the following conditions: 


as
of the closing date of the merger, the representations and warranties of the other party contained in the merger agreement which are qualified as to
material adverse effect will be true in all respects; and the representations and warranties which are not qualified as to material adverse effect will be true in all material respects, except for
those representations and warranties which address matters only as of a particular date, which will be true and correct as of such date; and


the
other party will have performed or complied in all material respects with its obligations contained in the merger agreement. 

    Additionally,
Applera's obligation to effect the merger and the other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement is conditioned upon: 


the
receipt of all necessary governmental and third party licenses, permits, consents, approvals, authorizations, qualifications and orders, except where
the failure to obtain these licenses, 

permits,
consents, approvals, authorizations, qualifications and orders could not reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on Axys or on Axys' ability to perform its obligations under
the merger agreement; 


the
absence of any litigation or action pending or threatened by a governmental entity which seeks to, among other things, restrain or prohibit the merger
or limit Applera's ownership or operation of Axys; and


the
rights under the Axys stockholder rights agreement will not be redeemable and will not become redeemable upon the consummation of the merger. 

Stock Exchange Listings  

    Applera has agreed to use all reasonable efforts to cause the Celera Genomics common stock to be issued in the merger and upon the exercise or conversion of
the stock options, warrants and convertible notes granted or issued by Axys prior to the closing of the merger to be approved for listing on the New York Stock Exchange. 

Regulatory Approvals Required  

    The Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976 prohibits Axys and Applera from completing the merger until after we have filed the
required notification and report forms and furnished any additional information and materials requested by the Antitrust Division of the United States Department of Justice and the United States
Federal Trade Commission, if requested, and the required waiting period has expired or terminated. The required notification and report forms under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act were filed by
Axys and Applera with the Antitrust Division of the United States Department of Justice and the United States Federal Trade Commission on June 29, 2001. Accordingly, the waiting period under
the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act will expire on July 30, 2001 unless, on or prior to that date, either the Antitrust Division or the Federal Trade Commission requests additional
information or documentary material from Applera or Axys. There can be no assurance that a challenge to the merger on antitrust grounds will not be made or, if a challenge is made, that it would not
be successful. A challenge could be brought by governmental or private parties, and could seek to enjoin consummation of the merger or to compel the divestiture of businesses conducted by Axys or
Applera. 

Termination of the Merger Agreement  

    Right to Terminate.
  Axys and Applera may mutually agree to terminate the merger agreement at any time. In addition,
either of Axys or Applera may terminate the merger agreement if specified events do or do not occur. These include: 


if
a court or government regulator permanently prohibits the merger;


if
the merger is not completed by December 31, 2001, except that a party may not terminate the merger agreement if the cause of the merger not being
completed by that date is that party's failure to fulfill its obligations under the merger agreement;


if
the holders of Axys common stock fail to approve the merger agreement at a duly held meeting held for the purpose of voting on the merger and the merger
agreement; or


the
other party breaches any of its representations, covenants or agreements so that a closing condition would not be satisfied and, if curable, the breach
remains uncured for 30 days following notice. 

    The merger agreement may also be terminated by Applera if Axys or its board of directors: 


withdraws,
modifies or amends in any respect adverse to Applera its approval or recommendation of the merger and the merger agreement;


approves
or recommends any transaction proposal from a third party; or


in
response to the commencement of any tender offer or exchange offer for more than 15% of the outstanding shares of Axys common stock, does not recommend
rejection of the tender offer or exchange offer. 

    In
addition, Axys may terminate the merger agreement, after it receives a superior proposal and complying with its obligations under the merger agreement with respect to the superior
proposal, if its board of directors concludes in good faith, upon consultation with outside counsel, that in order to avoid violating the fiduciary duties of the board of directors of Axys to the
stockholders of Axys under the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, that the board of directors must not make or must withdraw or modify its recommendation that the stockholders of Axys
approve the merger and the merger agreement. 

    Effect of Termination.
  Under the terms of the merger agreement, if the merger agreement is terminated it will become
void and have no effect, and neither Applera nor Axys will have any liability to the other, except that: 


Axys
may have to pay a termination fee to Applera as described below under "Termination Fee" in this proxy statement/prospectus;


no
party will be relieved from liability for any breach of the merger agreement prior to its termination;


Applera
and Axys have agreed that for 1 year following the termination of the merger agreement, under certain circumstances, each of Applera and
Axys will not raid the employees employed by the other party or its subsidiaries in violation of California legal principles; and


certain
provisions of the merger agreement expressly survive the termination on customary terms. 

    Termination Fee.
  Axys will pay to Applera $5.6 million plus out-of-pocket fees and
expenses incurred by Applera not exceeding $900,000 if any of the following events occur: 


prior
to the termination of the merger agreement, any person makes, proposes, communicates or discloses in a manner which is or otherwise becomes public a
bona fide intention to make a transaction proposal; and on or prior to 12 months after the date of such termination, a third party consummates a transaction which qualifies as a transaction
proposal or Axys enters into a definitive agreement with a third party the terms of which would otherwise qualify as a transaction proposal; and either:


the
merger agreement is terminated by Applera because Axys willfully breaches the merger agreement after a bona fide intention to make a transaction
proposal becomes public as described above; or


the
merger agreement is terminated by Applera or Axys because the stockholders of Axys fail to approve the merger agreement at a duly held meeting held for
the purpose of voting on the merger and the merger agreement; or 


Applera
terminates the merger agreement due to:


the
Axys board of directors withdrawing, modifying or amending in any respect adverse to Applera its approval or recommendation of the merger and the
merger agreement (or resolving to do so);


the
Axys board of directors approving or recommending any transaction proposal from a third party (or resolving to do so); or


the
Axys board of directors, in response to the commencement of any tender offer or exchange offer for more than 15% of the outstanding shares of Axys
common stock, not recommending rejection of the tender offer or exchange offer; or 


the
Axys board of directors terminates the merger agreement because, after receiving a superior proposal and complying with Axys' obligations in the merger
agreement with respect to the superior proposal, the Axys board of directors concludes in good faith, upon consultation with outside counsel, that in order to avoid violating its fiduciary duties to
the stockholders of Axys under the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, the Axys board of directors must withdraw or modify its recommendation that the stockholders of Axys approve and
adopt the merger agreement and approve the merger. 

Amendment and Waiver of the Merger Agreement  

    The merger agreement may be amended by the parties at any time before or after approval of the merger agreement by the holders of Axys common stock, except
that after that stockholder approval is obtained, there will be no amendment that by law requires further approval by the stockholders without further approval of the stockholders. All amendments to
the merger agreement must be in a writing signed by Applera, Axys and Angel Acquisition. 

    At
any time prior to the effective time of the merger, the parties to the merger agreement may, to the extent legally allowed: 


extend
the time for the performance of any of the obligations or other acts of the other parties to the merger agreement;


waive
any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties of the other parties contained in the merger agreement or in any document delivered pursuant
to the merger agreement; and


waive
compliance by the other parties with any of the agreements or conditions contained in the merger agreement (subject to the same conditions that apply
to amendments). 

    All
extensions and waivers must be in writing and signed by the party against whom the waiver is to be effective. 

Expenses  

    Axys and Applera have agreed that all costs and expenses incurred in connection with the merger, including the parties' respective brokers fees, will be paid
by the party incurring the expenses, except
that Applera will pay 75% of the cost of filing, printing and distributing the registration statement and this proxy statement/prospectus and Axys will pay 25% of the cost. In addition, Axys may be
required to pay Applera a termination fee and reimburse Applera for certain expenses in the event the merger agreement is terminated under circumstances described in detail under
"Termination of the Merger AgreementTermination Fee" in this proxy statement/prospectus. 

Effect on Employee Benefits and Related Agreements  

    Benefit Plans.
  Applera has agreed that following the effective time of the merger until July 1, 2002, employees
of Axys will participate in the employment benefits plans maintained by Applera or the surviving corporation providing benefits no less favorable in the aggregate than those benefits currently
provided by Axys, excluding any stock compensation plans or programs and arrangements. Applera has also agreed to waive limitations as to pre-existing conditions, exclusions and waiting
periods with respect to participation and coverage requirements applying to Axys' employees in Applera benefit plans following the effective time of the merger and to provide credit for amounts paid
by Axys employees prior to the effective time of the merger in satisfying deductible or out-of-pocket requirements under Applera's welfare plans. Applera will give employees of
Axys at the effective time of the merger who remain employees thereafter full credit, under each Applera employee benefit plan in which the employee may participate, for service under each comparable
Axys employee benefit plan maintained by Axys immediately before the effective time of the merger for purposes of eligibility and vesting and entitlement to vacation and vacation pay, but not for
purposes of benefit accrual under any employee pension benefit plan. 

    Extension of Stock Options.
  If Applera or any of its subsidiaries terminate any Axys employee without cause within
90 days after the effective time, Applera has agreed to cause the employees' vested stock options that were converted from Axys stock options to be amended to provide that the exercise period
for these vested options will be extended so as to permit their exercise by the terminated employee for a period of 12 months after the date of his or her termination. However, in the case of
any employee holding an option intended to qualify as an incentive stock option under Section 421 of the Internal Revenue Code, the extension will be made only with the consent of the
terminated employee. Mr. Hastings has indicated that he will not consent to any extension of his options in the event his employment is terminated. 

Material United States Federal Income Tax Consequences  

    The following discussion sets forth the material United States federal income tax consequences of the merger to United States holders (as defined below) of
Axys common stock. This discussion is based upon the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, Treasury regulations and court and administrative rulings and decisions in effect on the date of this
proxy statement/prospectus. These laws may change, possibly retroactively, and any change could affect the continuing validity of this discussion. This discussion does not address any tax consequences
arising under the laws of any state, locality or foreign jurisdiction. 

    For
purposes of this discussion, we use the term "United States holder" to mean: 


a
citizen or resident of the United States;


a
corporation, partnership or other entity created or organized under the laws of the United States or any of its political subdivisions;


a
trust that (x) is subject to the supervision of a court within the United States and the control of one or more United States persons or
(y) has a valid election in effect under applicable United States Treasury regulations to be treated as a United States person; or


an
estate that is subject to United States federal income tax on its income regardless of its source. 

    This
discussion assumes that you hold your shares of Axys common stock as a capital asset and does not address the tax consequences that may be relevant to you in light of your
particular circumstances. In addition, it does not present a description of the United States federal income tax 

laws applicable to you if you are subject to special treatment under the United States federal income tax laws, including if you are: 


a
financial institution;


a
tax-exempt organization;


an
S corporation or other pass-through entity;


an
insurance company;


a
mutual fund;


a
dealer in securities or foreign currencies;


a
trader in securities that elects the mark-to-market method of accounting for your securities;


a
holder of Axys common stock who received your Axys common stock through the exercise of employee stock options or otherwise as compensation or through a
tax-qualified retirement plan;


a
person that has a functional currency other than the United States dollar;


a
holder of options granted under any Axys benefit plan; or


a
holder of Axys common stock who holds Axys common stock as part of a hedge, straddle or conversion transaction. 

    Applera
and Axys have not and will not seek any ruling from the Internal Revenue Service regarding any matters relating to the merger. The Internal Revenue Service has announced that
it will not issue advance rulings on the classification of an instrument similar to Celera Genomics common stock that has certain voting and liquidation rights in an issuing corporation but whose
dividend rights are determined by reference to a segregated portion of the issuing corporation's assets, including assets held by a subsidiary. In addition, there are no court decisions or other
authorities bearing directly on the classification of instruments with characteristics similar to those of Celera Genomics common stock. 

    It
is a condition to the closing of the merger that each of Applera and Axys receive an opinion from its tax counsel that the merger qualifies as a reorganization within the meaning
of Section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. The opinions will be based on customary assumptions and factual representations and will assume that the merger will be
completed according to the terms of the merger agreement. An opinion of counsel represents counsel's best legal judgment and is not binding on the Internal Revenue Service or any court. The following
discussion of United States federal income tax consequences of the merger assumes that, if completed, the merger will qualify as a reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the
Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended for United States federal income tax purposes. Based upon the above assumptions and qualifications, the merger will generally result in the following United
States federal income tax consequences: 


Applera
and Axys will not recognize gain or loss;


you
will not recognize gain or loss when you exchange your Axys common stock solely for Celera Genomics common stock;


you
will recognize capital gain or loss on any cash received in lieu of a fractional share of Celera Genomics common stock equal to the difference between
the amount of cash received and the basis allocated to such fractional share which will constitute long-term capital gain or loss if your holding period in the Axys stock surrendered in
the merger is more than one year as of the date of the merger; 


the
aggregate tax basis of Celera Genomics common stock you receive will be the same as the aggregate tax basis of the Axys common stock you surrender in
exchange, decreased by the tax basis allocated to any fractional share interest exchanged for cash;


the
holding period of Celera Genomics common stock you receive will include the holding period of shares of Axys common stock you surrender in the
exchange; and


you
must retain records and file with your United States federal income tax returns a statement setting forth certain facts relating to the merger. 

    Backup Withholding.
  If you are a noncorporate holder of Axys common stock, you may be subject to backup withholding on
any cash payments received in lieu of a fractional share interest in Celera Genomics common stock. You will not be subject to backup withholding, however, if you: 


furnish
a correct taxpayer identification number and certify that you are not subject to backup withholding on the substitute Form W-9
or successor form included in the letter of transmittal to be delivered to you following the completion of the merger;


provide
a certification of foreign status on Form W-8BEN or a successor form; or


are
otherwise exempt from backup withholding. 

    Any
amounts withheld under the backup withholding rules will be allowed as a refund or credit against your United States federal income tax liability, provided you furnish the
required information to the Internal Revenue Service. 

Tax matters are very complicated, and the tax consequences of the merger to you will depend upon your particular tax situation. We encourage you to consult
your own tax advisors regarding the specific tax consequences of the merger, including tax return reporting requirements, the applicability of federal, state, local and foreign tax laws and the effect
of any proposed change in the tax laws.

Accounting Treatment  

    For accounting and financial reporting purposes, the merger will be treated as a purchase by Applera under generally accepted accounting principles. 

Interests of Certain Persons in the Merger  

    In considering the recommendation of the Axys board of directors with respect to the merger agreement and the merger, you should be aware that some of Axys'
directors and executive officers have interests in the merger that may be different from, or in addition to, your interests as a stockholder. The Axys board of directors was aware of these differing
interests and considered them, among other matters, in recommending that you approve and adopt the merger agreement and approve the merger. These interests are summarized below. 

 Employment Agreements  

    Axys has entered into employment agreements with its executive officers: Mr. Hastings; Daniel F. Hoth, M.D., Senior Vice President and Chief Medical
Officer of Axys; Mr. Newell; David E. Riggs, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of Axys; Dr. Venuti; and Douglas H. Altschuler, Vice President and General Counsel of Axys;
and director John H. Walker. These agreements may, under the circumstances set forth below, entitle the officer to severance or termination pay or accelerate stock option vesting in connection with
the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement. 

    Executive Employment Agreement of Mr. Hastings dated as of January 23, 2001.
  Mr. Hastings became
President and Chief Executive Officer of Axys in January 2001. Mr. Hastings' employment agreement provides for an annualized base salary equal to $400,000 (subject to review each year)
and 

eligibility for an annual bonus up to fifty percent of his then current base salary upon achievement of reasonable goals set by the Axys board of directors. Under the terms of the agreement, Axys
loaned Mr. Hastings $300,000 and Mr. Hastings issued a full-recourse promissory note, secured by any shares of Axys common stock received by him in connection with any stock
option exercise, to Axys on January 2, 2001. The note bears interest at a rate of 5.61% per annum and is payable in full on the earlier of thirty days following Mr. Hastings' termination
of employment (other than as set forth below) or January 2, 2004. So long as Mr. Hastings continues to render services to Axys, one thirty-sixth of the principal amount of the note and
any interest accrued thereon will be forgiven on the first day of each calendar month. The agreement also provides that Mr. Hastings will receive medical and dental coverage and other standard
benefits from time to time provided by Axys to its executives or other employees in general. 

    If
Mr. Hastings is terminated for any reason other than death, disability, change of control, voluntarily without good reason, or for cause, he will receive one year's base
salary (currently $400,000) and his yearly target bonus (currently $200,000) paid in twelve monthly installments, together with forgiveness of all remaining principal and interest due to Axys under
the note. Mr. Hastings' options to purchase Axys' common stock that would have vested had he remained in employment an additional twelve months will immediately vest. Axys will also continue to
pay the costs associated with his health care benefits for up to twelve months or until he acquires comparable benefits. In the event that Mr. Hastings is terminated, including a voluntary
termination by Mr. Hastings for good reason, upon a change of control, he will within seven days receive a lump sum payment equal to eighteen months of his base salary plus a pro rata share of
his bonus for the calendar year in which the termination occurs, plus an additional eighteen months of his target bonus. Mr. Hastings will also receive eighteen months of continued health
benefits (unless comparable benefits become available to him during that time). All of Mr. Hastings' outstanding options to purchase Axys' common stock shall become fully vested and exercisable
immediately upon his termination. In order to obtain these lump sum payments, accelerated vesting and health care benefits in the case of any provided for termination scenario, Mr. Hastings
must sign a release of all claims against Axys. Although Mr. Hastings may be able to voluntarily terminate his employment with good reason following the merger, Mr. Hastings has agreed
not to do so for a period
of six months. In addition, the Celera Genomics group has agreed to recommend to the Management Resources Committee of the Applera board of directors that Mr. Hastings receive an incentive
package in consideration of his efforts in integrating Axys and the Celera Genomics group following the merger. 

    Executive Employment Agreement of Dr. Hoth dated as of March 30, 2001.
  Dr. Hoth's employment
agreement provides for an annualized base salary equal to $305,000 (subject to review) and eligibility for an annual bonus up to thirty percent of his then current base salary upon achievement of
reasonable goals set by the Axys board of directors. The agreement also provides that Dr. Hoth will receive the standard benefits from time to time provided by Axys to its executive employees
generally. 

    If
Dr. Hoth is terminated involuntarily without cause at any time or voluntarily for good reason after a change of control, he will receive his annual salary and bonus accrued
but unpaid as of that date plus health benefits for one year. Specifically, within thirty days following the effectiveness of a release of all claims against Axys, Dr. Hoth will receive a lump
sum payment equal to one year's base salary (currently $305,000) plus one year's target bonus (currently $91,500). If Dr. Hoth's termination is within eighteen months following a change of
control, 100% of his options to purchase shares of Axys' common stock will immediately vest and become exercisable. In order to obtain the lump sum payment and accelerated vesting benefits,
Dr. Hoth must sign a release of all claims against Axys. 

    Amended and Restated Executive Employment Agreement of Mr. Newell dated as of March 27, 2001.

change of control, 100% of his options to purchase shares of Axys' common stock will immediately vest and become exercisable. In order to obtain the lump sum payment and accelerated vesting benefits,
Mr. Riggs must sign a release of all claims against Axys. 

    Amended and Restated Executive Employment Agreement of Dr. Venuti dated as of March 28, 2001.

  Dr. Venuti's employment agreement provides for an annualized base salary equal to $290,000 (subject to review) and eligibility for an annual bonus up to thirty percent of his
then current base salary upon achievement of reasonable goals set by the Axys board of directors. Dr. Venuti was obligated to pay Axys principal and accrued interest under a $300,000 promissory
note issued to Axys as of August 14, 2000; the agreement provides that (other than as set forth below), so long as he continues to render services to Axys through such dates, Axys will forgive
$60,000 of the indebtedness on August 14, 2001 and each August 14 through 2005. The agreement also provides that Dr. Venuti will receive the standard benefits from time to time
provided by Axys to its executive employees generally. 

    This
agreement provides that if Dr. Venuti is terminated involuntarily without cause at any time or voluntarily for "good reason" after a change of control, he will receive his
annual salary and bonus accrued but unpaid as of that date plus health benefits for one year. Specifically, within thirty days following the effectiveness of a release of all claims against Axys,
Dr. Venuti will receive a lump sum payment equal to one year's base salary (currently $290,000) plus one year's target bonus (currently $87,000). If the termination is within eighteen months
following a change of control, 100% of Dr. Venuti's options to purchase shares of Axys' common stock will immediately vest and become exercisable and principal and accrued interest amounts
outstanding under the Note shall be forgiven as of the date of his termination. In order to obtain the lump sum payment, accelerated vesting and debt forgiveness benefits, Dr. Venuti must sign
a release of all claims against Axys. 

    Dr. Venuti
has signed an additional amendment to his employment agreement waiving certain rights that may arise upon consummation of the transactions contemplated by the merger
agreement, and in particular specifying that the completion of the merger and the fact that Dr. Venuti will be 

working for a subsidiary of Applera and may report to an officer of Applera or one of its subsidiaries will not constitute "good reason" for Dr. Venuti to voluntarily terminate his employment. 

    Executive Employment Agreement of Mr. Altschuler dated as of December 14, 2000.
  This agreement provides
that if Mr. Altschuler is terminated involuntarily without cause at any time or voluntarily for good reason after a change of control, he will receive his annual salary and bonus accrued but
unpaid as of that date plus health benefits for one year. Specifically, within thirty days following the effectiveness of a release of all claims against Axys, Mr. Altschuler will receive a
lump sum payment equal to one year's base salary (currently $230,000) plus one year's target bonus (currently $57,500). If Mr. Altschuler's termination is within eighteen months following a
change of control, 100% of his options to purchase shares of Axys' common stock will immediately vest and become exercisable. In order to obtain the lump sum payment and accelerated vesting benefits,
Mr. Altschuler must sign a release of all claims against Axys. 

    Amended and Restated Employment Agreement of Mr. Walker dated as of December 14, 2000.

  Mr. Walker's agreement provides for an annualized base salary equal to $212,500 each year commencing on January 1, 2001 and terminating on December 31, 2003. On
the date of the agreement, Mr. Walker was obligated to pay Axys principal in the amount of $400,000 and accrued interest in the amount of $94,611.04 in connection with a promissory note issued
by Mr. Walker to Axys. Effective as of such date and under the terms of the agreement, Axys forgave all outstanding principal and interest due under the note and agreed to pay Mr. Walker
a tax gross-up payment of $160,000. The agreement provides that Axys will, at its sole expense, provide Mr. Walker and his eligible dependents with medical and dental plan benefits,
which benefits will be provided without regard to whether Mr. Walker continues to render services to Axys. Additionally, so long as Mr. Walker continues to render services to Axys, Axys
will maintain a split-dollar life insurance policy in Mr. Walker's name to which Axys made premium payments while Mr. Walker was the Chief Executive Officer of Axys and which includes a
collateral assignment in favor of Axys. Mr. Walker is also entitled to all other rights and benefits that Axys from time to time provides to its executive employees generally. 

    If
Mr. Walker is terminated other than for cause or good reason, he will receive in a lump sum an amount equal to his base salary ($212,500) for each of the calendar years
2001, 2002 and 2003 (less any amount he has already been paid). In addition, any options to purchase common stock of Axys that are unvested immediately prior to the termination of his employment will
immediately vest and become exercisable as of that date. In order to obtain the lump sum payment and accelerated vesting benefits, Mr. Walker must sign a release of all claims against Axys. 

    Certain
other Axys employees are also party to employment agreements with Axys containing similar provisions relating to the effects of a change of control. Some of these employees
have entered into agreements with Applera specifying that the completion of the merger and the fact that the employees will be working for a subsidiary of Applera will not constitute "good reason" for
the employees to voluntarily terminate their employment under the terms of their employment agreements. For other Axys employees, including those described above other than Mr. Hastings and
Dr. Venuti, these post-merger changes may constitute good reason for voluntary termination of employment. 

 Stock Options  

    Axys' equity-based compensation plans, other than Axys' Non-Employee Directors' Stock Option Plan established in 1994, do not provide for the
acceleration of outstanding options upon a change in control in which options are assumed. As of the record date, Axys' directors and executive officers held vested and unvested options to acquire an
aggregate of 88,229 shares of Axys common stock with a weighted average exercise price of $6.55 per share. Under the merger agreement, upon the consummation of the merger, each of these options,
whether vested or unvested, will be converted into an option to acquire a number of shares of Celera Genomics common stock equal to the number of 

shares subject to the Axys option multiplied by the exchange ratio, rounded down, at an exercise price equal to the exercise price of the Axys option divided by the exchange ratio, rounded up. In no
event, however, will the exercise price for options held by employees of or consultants to Axys exceed the closing price of a share of Celera Genomics common stock on the date immediately prior to the
closing of the merger. 

    In
addition, in the event that Applera or any of its subsidiaries terminates the employment of an employee of Axys without cause within 90 days of the consummation of the
merger, the exercise period for any vested options then held by the terminated employee will be extended to a total of 12 months following the termination. However, in the case of any employee
holding an option intended to qualify as an incentive stock option under Section 421 of the Internal Revenue Code, the extension will be made only with the consent of the terminated employee.
Mr. Hastings has indicated that he will not consent to any extension of his options in the event his employment is terminated. 

    Under
the Axys Non-Employee Directors' Stock Option Plan established in 1994, non-employee directors of Axys receive annual automatic stock option grants. Options granted under the
plan generally vest at a rate of 25% per year for four years. In the event of a change-in-control of Axys, such as the proposed merger, the vesting of these options will accelerate and the options
expire if not exercised prior to the change-in-control. As a result, the non-employee directors will be able to exercise options to purchase 88,750 shares of Axys common stock at an average exercise
price of $6.50. If the non-employee directors do not exercise these options prior to the completion of the merger, all options to purchase these shares of Axys common stock will expire. For more
information about this stock option plan, see "Management of AxysCompensation of Non-Employee Directors of Axys" in this proxy statement/prospectus. 

 Indemnification Agreements  

    Pre-Existing Indemnification and Insurance.
  Axys has entered into separate indemnification agreements with
each of its directors and officers which require Axys, among other things, to indemnify them against liabilities arising from their status as directors or officers to the fullest extent permitted by
Axys' amended and restated bylaws and Delaware law. In addition, Axys' amended and restated bylaws provide that Axys will indemnify its directors and officers to the fullest extent permitted by
Delaware law, including in circumstances in which indemnification is otherwise discretionary under Delaware law. Axys also maintains directors' and officer's liability insurance. 

    Additional Indemnification and Insurance.
  The merger agreement provides that Applera and the surviving corporation of
the merger will, to the fullest extent permitted by law, indemnify and hold harmless each of Axys' present and former directors and officers against any costs or expenses arising out of or pertaining
to the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, or for any actions or omissions at or prior to the effective time of the merger, in each case to the same extent provided in Axys' amended and
restated certificate of incorporation, Axys' amended and restated bylaws or any pre-existing indemnification contract with the present or former director or officer. The surviving
corporation of the merger must maintain policies of directors' and officers' liability insurance containing terms and conditions which are not less advantageous than policies maintained by Axys prior
to the effective time of the merger for a period of six years following the closing of the merger (provided that the surviving corporation of the merger is not required to pay an annual premium for
any policy in excess of 200% of the annual premiums currently paid by Axys). 

Resale of Celera Genomics Common Stock  

    The shares of Celera Genomics common stock to be issued to stockholders of Axys pursuant to the merger have been registered under the Securities Act, so these
shares may generally be freely traded without restriction by people who will not be "affiliates" of Applera after the merger and who 

were not "affiliates" of Axys on the date of the Axys special meeting for purposes of Rule 145 under the Securities Act. All directors and certain officers of Axys may be deemed to have been
"affiliates" of Axys within the meaning of such rule. Those people may resell Celera Genomics common stock received by them in the merger only if the shares are registered for resale under the
Securities Act or an exemption from such registration under the Securities Act is available. Those people may be permitted to effect resales under the safe harbor provisions of Rule 145 under
the Securities Act (or Rule 144 in the case of such persons who become "affiliates" of Applera) or as otherwise permitted under the Securities Act. People who may be deemed to be affiliates of
Axys or Applera generally include individuals or entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common control with, Axys or Applera, as applicable, and may include certain officers and
directors of such party as well as principal stockholders of Axys or Applera, as applicable. It is recommended that any such person obtain advice of securities counsel prior to effecting any resales. 

    This
proxy statement/prospectus does not cover resales of Celera Genomics common stock received by any person, including any person who may be deemed to be an affiliate of Applera or
Axys. 

Dissenters' Rights  

    Under Delaware law, stockholders of Axys will not be entitled to exercise dissenters' appraisal rights or to demand payment for their shares in connection with
the merger. 

INFORMATION ABOUT AXYS    

Business  

Overview  

    Axys is a biopharmaceutical company focused on the discovery, design and development of therapeutic small molecules that address significant markets with major
unmet medical needs. Axys collaborates with large pharmaceutical companies in discovering therapeutics for chronic diseases for which there are large markets. Axys also selectively focuses its own
resources on discovering and developing therapeutics for the treatment of various types of cancer and other specialty therapeutic opportunities. Axys has on-going programs in the treatment
of autoimmune diseases, inflammatory diseases, and cancer. Axys' drug design platform integrates advanced biology, chemistry, biophysics and information technologies to optimize the potency,
selectivity and physical properties of new drugs, making the drug discovery process more efficient and productive. 

    Currently,
Axys has significant collaborations with Aventis Pharmaceuticals Products, Inc. (a subsidiary of Aventis S.A.), Merck & Co. and Bayer A.G. These
collaborations provide Axys with financial support and collaborative resources for these research programs. Axys' partners are also responsible for developing Axys' clinical drug candidates and
commercializing Axys' products in broad medical markets in the event Axys' products are approved by the United States Food & Drug Administration. Axys believes that several of its partnered
programs are positioned to advance into human clinical testing over the next few years, which Axys expects will generate increased milestone payments and eventual royalty streams. Axys has additional
research programs underway, both proprietary and in collaboration with other life science companies, and Axys believes that novel drug candidates will enter clinical studies within the next 12 to
18 months. At the present time, Axys aims to establish additional partnerships with major pharmaceutical companies in order to obtain the funding and collaborative research support needed to
expand its discovery efforts in cancer and other areas. 

    Axys
believes that advances in genomic research represent a major opportunity for drug discovery directed at novel biological targets. Axys seeks to exploit this opportunity by
combining medicinal
chemistry and molecular biology, through collaborations and internally, to identify possible drug candidates for a drug target or group of drug targets. Over the next few years, Axys expects to
continue its research and development efforts and to bring drug candidates into clinical development. Axys also seeks to license and acquire technologies, resources and products that have the
potential to strengthen its drug discovery platform and product pipeline. 

    During
the year 2000, Axys reported gains of $61.2 million on the sale of two of Axys' three non-core affiliated companies. In April 2000, Axys sold Advanced
Technologies to Discovery Partners. Discovery Partners completed an initial public offering of common stock in July 2000. In consideration of the sale of Advanced Technologies, Axys received
7,425,000 shares of Discovery Partners common stock with a carrying value of $40.4 million on December 31, 2000. In December 2000, Axys also sold its interest in PPGx, Axys'
pharmacogenomics subsidiary, to DNA Sciences for 1,478,550 shares of Series D Preferred Stock and 108 shares of common stock in DNA Sciences, valued in the aggregate at $15 million as of
December 31, 2001. In addition, at December 31, 2000, Axys owned 23% of Akkadix. In March 2001, Axys' ownership interest increased to 44% in connection with the exercise of
contractual put options held by third party investors in Akkadix (see note 3 in the financial statements of Axys that appear commencing on page F-1 of this proxy
statement/prospectus). 

What Gives Axys an Edge in Drug Discovery and Development?  

    The entire drug discovery process runs from target identification and validation to lead identification to preclinical development to clinical development. The
following sections describe each part of this process and the technologies that Axys employs in drug discovery. 

    In recent years, the advent of new drug discovery technologies, including genomics, bioinformatics, computational sciences, structure-based drug design, combinatorial chemistry and
high throughput screening, has offered great potential for streamlining the lengthy and expensive process of drug discovery. Axys has assembled a premier platform for drug discovery by combining and
integrating these new technologies with the traditional pharmaceutical sciences, including medicinal chemistry and pharmacology. Axys' capabilities in this area, which include assay development,
compound screening, lead optimization, pharmacology and preclinical development, are instrumental in increasing the speed and efficiency of Axys' drug candidate identification efforts. In addition,
Axys has functional genomics capabilities, which it is using to select and validate targets for Axys' cancer research. 

    As
a biopharmaceutical company, Axys' core strengths lie in the portion of the drug discovery continuum spanning from selection of leads from hits in primary screens, through lead
optimization using structure-based drug design and combinatorial chemistry, to preclinical development and pharmacology. In this regard, Axys believes it is among the few biotechnology companies
having an in-house medicinal chemistry group of Axys' size and scope. 

 Target Identification and Validation  

    Target identification and validation is the process of identifying and validating those genetic-based targets that are the most promising for therapeutic
intervention by small molecules. There are numerous potential targets, which may apply to all manner of diseases. As described below, Axys is currently focusing its target identification and
validation efforts on discovering new biochemical pathways in cancer. 

    The
human genome is the collection of all the genetic information of a human being. Scientifically defined, the human genome consists of 23 pairs of chromosomes that contain the
40,000 or so genes that define every human's make-up. Genes are made up of DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid). In humans, a DNA molecule resembles a twisted ladder and consists of two
strandsa double helixwhose carbohydrate-like sides are connected by pairs of nitrogen-containing chemicals called bases, which form the rungs of the ladder. The
particular order of the bases is called the DNA sequence. In total, there are approximately 3 billion base pairs of DNA comprising all of the chromosomes in the human genome. Much effort has
been devoted by various governments, research institutions and companies to mapping out the exact location of each gene on each chromosome in order to determine the complete DNA sequence of the
3 billion DNA bases. Detailed knowledge of the human genome is now available, either through public databases or through commercially available databases. Through 1999, Axys had applied the
technology generally known as positional cloning to disease gene identification. This technology depended on securing DNA samples from donor populations with a known disease incidence, followed by
high throughput genotyping and DNA sequencing to establish a linkage between the disease and a particular chromosome or specific gene. 

    However,
knowing the sequence of a gene is really only the beginning of the drug discovery process. The next step is the determination of the biological processes in which the gene
plays a role. The term "functional genomics" refers to a variety of scientific disciplines that examine gene function and identify disease pathways resulting from a gene or genes that are not
functioning properly. The job of determining the functions of a geneand its protein productsrequires testing in systems that approximate human systems, such as the C. elegans
(nematode worm) system. 

    Although
Axys was a pioneer in genomics research using positional cloning techniques in many different disease areas, Axys concluded in 1999 that many of its genomics programs were at
too early a stage and too far removed from product development to justify the sizeable investment that Axys was making. So, during the last half of 1999, Axys wound down its genomics research programs
which were based on positional cloning technology. Axys continues to utilize its genomics capabilities as part of its cancer research programs. Axys has integrated these capabilities with its
functional genomics 

capabilities to create a directed set of target identification and validation tools, which include bioinformatics, a sophisticated antisense knock-out technology, expression array
technology and C. elegans nematode biology, all of which Axys uses to discover new biochemical pathways in cancer. 

    Axys
makes use of both proprietary and licensed bioinformatics software to enable the discovery of new genes and the identification of known genes and species homologs (sister genes)
in its efforts in target identification and validation. When new gene sequences are identified, Axys is able to rapidly access both public and proprietary databases through these software tools. When
the function of a gene needs to be determined, especially in the case when it might play a pivotal role in a biochemical process, Axys can use antisense knock-out technology, either in
well-characterized functional systems, such as the nematode worm, or in mammalian systems. For most applications of antisense, as applied to specific new targets, Axys has licensed the
technology from Atugen. Axys also employs sophisticated gene expression array technology, licensed from Molecular Dynamics-Amersham. Using this technology, very small arrays are custom built on glass
slides to study the expression levels of thousands of genes at the same time. With the information generated from these arrays, Axys can compare differences in gene expression between normal and
diseased or genetically manipulated cells. Finally, another technology Axys uses is C. elegans, a microscopic multicellular round worm that is the most thoroughly understood multicellular animal in
terms of cellular development, anatomy and genetic content. C. elegans is useful as a research tool because as many as 70% of the currently known human disease genes possess a highly significant
homolog in the nematode. 

    By
combining gene expression data and Axys' antisense results with information about genetic relationships gained from model systems and Axys' bioinformatics capabilities, Axys is
better able to identify points in biological pathways that may be the best point of intervention for a potential therapeutic. For a description of some of Axys' more significant target validation and
identification activities in cancer in 2000 and the first half of 2001, see the section below entitled "What Does Axys' Non-Partnered Research and Development Franchise Look Like?" 

 Lead Identification  

    Once a biological point of intervention or target is identified and validated, Axys has the capability to rapidly identify chemical compounds that regulate the
protein product of the relevant gene. Axys has generated such lead compounds for new biological targets at a rapid pace by making use of a broad range of technologies in dual discovery tracks:
(1) structure-based drug design driven by X-ray crystallography and computational modeling, and (2) high throughput screening combined with chemical compound diversity. 

    Axys
uses a broad range of scientific capabilities to study the basic structure of molecules (X-ray crystallography) and advanced chemistry that uses the knowledge gained
from crystallography and structural biology. These technologies can speed research by enabling an understanding of the precise three-dimensional structure of a target associated with a disease. Then,
Axys brings additional computational science capabilities into play. Axys has a rapid, flexible molecular docking model that can be used to find a natural or synthetic "inhibitor" that can bind to the
molecule and change the way
it will perform in the body. By using structure-based design, Axys has the ability to rapidly create lead compounds that are less likely to cause side effects or be toxic. 

    Axys'
medicinal chemists also play an important role in Axys' lead identification efforts. The chemists obtain iterative structural information from X-ray crystallography
and molecular modeling, complemented by powerful computational resources and coupled with production-level protein expression and purification, all of which enables them to develop and refine target
compound families. Axys' particular strength is in the determination of serine and cysteine protease protein structures, and the design of small molecules with potency and specificity among these
closely related protein family members. Proteases are enzymes, which play a critical role in virtually every biological process. Axys 

believes the ability to develop inhibitors of proteases may give Axys important advantages in its drug discovery activities. 

    Axys'
combinatorial chemistry expertise compliments its structure-based design activities. Combinatorial chemistry capabilities are particularly useful where there is little known
structural information. Axys has created compound diversity libraries, originally through Axys' former subsidiary Advanced Technologies, which has synthesized and delivered to Axys approximately
530,000 individual compounds to date. Axys may develop additional compound diversity libraries or purchase additional compounds from Discovery Partners. Axys projects to have received an aggregate of
approximately 600,000 such compounds, encompassing over 140 distinct sub-libraries, by year-end 2001. Axys' medicinal and combinatorial chemists are able to generate a wide
variety of diversity or lead optimization libraries, depending on Axys' needs. Assays for high throughput screening are adapted for automation and validated for screening against diverse chemical
structures to provide data with a low false positive hit rate. Screening hits are rapidly confirmed or eliminated based on follow-up assays, and are qualified for further library expansion
and medicinal chemistry based on novelty, potency and selectivity criteria. 

    To
screen these libraries, Axys uses automated robotics systems. These robots test the binding activity of thousands of compounds against a disease target, usually a protein. This
binding activity is a measure of the compound's ability to inhibit or potentiate the activity of the protein. The primary role of the technology is to detect active compounds and supply directions for
their optimization using other techniques. Given the variety and size of chemical libraries available today, and the need to compare the results from multiple screens, data collection and management
of information are critical elements of high throughput screening. Axys maintains databases of structures, assays performed, screening results and other similar information in relational databases,
which can be queried from any number of research parameters. 

 Optimization, Preclinical Development and Clinical Development  

    Once a lead candidate has been identified, the most resource-intensive stage of Axys' drug discovery process begins. This is the process of identification of a
preclinical candidate with the desired pharmaceutical product profile. It requires directed medicinal chemistry efforts coupled closely with pharmacokinetics, drug metabolism and efficacy studies in
pharmacology. Axys' experience in such programs partnered with major pharmaceutical companies during the last several years has resulted in an integration of effort by Axys' medicinal chemists and
Axys' pharmacology group. 

    Axys
believes that it is one of the few biotechnology companies having an in-house medicinal chemistry group of its size and scope. Axys has approximately 55 medicinal
chemists. Axys uses its medicinal chemistry capabilities to improve the potency, selectivity (won't bind to wrong target), oral bioavailability (compound can be absorbed by the body when taken orally
as a pill), metabolic stability (how rapidly the body breaks down the compound), and biological half-life (how long the effects of the drug will last) of a drug candidate. 

    Axys
is building a new 43,500 square foot building dedicated to medicinal chemistry on the Axys research campus in South San Francisco, California. The facility will house medicinal
chemistry, X-ray crystallography and computational chemistry. This facility will be able to accommodate approximately 80 chemists upon completion in the latter half of 2001, allowing for
future growth. 

    Before
qualifying for evaluation in human trials, chemical compounds must pass extensive safety and effectiveness tests. In such tests, Axys uses cell-based and
animal-based models of human disease to provide important information on the duration of action of a potential drug, as well as how it is absorbed by the body or metabolized. On-site
studies take advantage of advanced technologies, such as mass spectrometry (a sensitive analytical method to identify a compound and the products into which it is broken down), to evaluate hundreds of
samples, indicating not only drug concentrations but also the 

pharmacodynamic (what the drug does to the body) and the pharmacokinetic (what the body does to the drug) characteristics of compounds nearing human clinical trials. 

    Finally,
while some of Axys' collaborative partners currently provide clinical development expertise, Axys also has an in-house clinical development group with the
capability to manage clinical trials, satisfy regulatory requirements, and ensure manufacturing quality control and quality assurance. This group is responsible for taking Axys' products forward into
human testing. 

What Drug Discovery Partnerships with Pharmaceutical Companies Does Axys Have?  

Partnered PipelinePreclinical    

    MerckOsteoporosis (Cathepsin K) 

    AventisInflammation
(Cathepsin S) 

    BayerAsthma
(Tryptase) 

 Merck (Cathepsin K Inhibitors/Osteoporosis/Preclinical)  

    In November 1996, Axys entered into a research and development collaboration with Merck to develop small molecule inhibitors of cathepsin K for the
treatment of osteoporosis. Osteoporosis is a disease of the bones that results in weakened bones which leads to pain, difficulty in moving, deformity and fractures. This condition mainly affects
post-menopausal women. 

    Cathepsin
K belongs to a class of enzymes called cysteine proteases. It is known to be secreted in excessive amounts by osteoclasts. In the healthy human body, osteoblast cells are
responsible for bone-building while osteoclasts are responsible for bone degradation. By maintaining a careful balance in each type of cell's activity, normal bone remodeling and skeletal
integrity is achieved. However, when the rate at which bone is destroyed by the osteoclasts exceeds the rate at which new bone is produced by osteoblasts, the result is excessive bone degradation
(bone resorption)a condition that results in brittle bones and is characteristic of osteoporosis. 

    In
February 1997, Axys announced the first-ever solution of the three-dimensional crystal structure of cathepsin K that has enabled Axys to design potent and
selective inhibitors of cathepsin K. In December 1999, Axys announced the successful testing of a specific, selective cathepsin K inhibitor compound in an animal efficacy model, which triggered
a milestone payment to Axys. In addition, although the research and development relationship was originally scheduled to end after two years and had already been extended for one additional year, Axys
agreed with Merck in December 1999 to extend this collaboration for another additional year until early November 2000. In November 2000, Axys and Merck extended their osteoporosis
collaboration for a fifth year to develop additional analog
compounds to those previously provided. In February 2001, Axys received $1.5 million payment from Merck for an important milestone attained in the cathepsin K inhibition program. Axys
expects IND-enabling studies to be completed in 2001, with phase I clinical trials initiated during the first quarter of 2002. 

 Aventis (Cathepsin S inhibitors/Inflammatory Diseases/Preclinical)  

    In December 1998, Axys entered into a collaborative research and development agreement with Aventis (successor to Rhone-Poulenc Rorer). The objective of
the collaboration is the discovery and development of small molecule therapeutics that inhibit cathepsin S, a human cysteine protease associated with certain inflammatory diseases. 

    Cathepsin
S is a cysteine protease found in antigen-presenting cells of the immune system. Unlike many other proteases, it is rarely found in other types of cells. Cathepsin S
is believed to function in a pathway that regulates the body's ability to fight off these foreign antigens, leading to an inflammatory 

reaction. As a result, it may be possible to use inhibitors of cathepsin S to block the pathway and consequently protect the body from certain inflammatory diseases and perhaps autoimmune
disorders. Axys' researchers were the first to solve the three-dimensional X-ray crystal structure of cathepsin S, as reported in June 1998 in Protein Science, which allowed Axys to
design potent and selective inhibitor drug candidates. 

    Cathepsin
S is associated with some inflammatory diseases, including arthritis, asthma, atherosclerosis and a variety of autoimmune diseases. Under the terms of the agreement, Aventis
has exclusive development and marketing rights to cathepsin S protease inhibitors for respiratory diseases, atherosclerosis and related conditions, rheumatoid arthritis, and multiple sclerosis.
Rheumatoid arthritis affects approximately 2.5 million Americans. Coronary heart disease is caused by the atherosclerotic narrowing of the coronary arteries and is the number one cause of death
in United States with approximately 500,000 deaths occurring annually. Approximately 350,000 people have been diagnosed with multiple sclerosis. 

    In
November 1999, Axys announced the successful testing of a potent, selective cathepsin S inhibitor compound in an animal efficacy model of asthma and received a milestone
payment. In addition, current in vivo proof-of-concept studies are underway and planned for rheumatoid arthritis and atherosclerosis. In October 2000, Axys announced
that on the basis of data from an in vivo efficacy model of asthma, Aventis qualified a collaboration compound for pre-clinical advancement. Upon successful completion of this work, Axys
expects Aventis to initiate IND-enabling studies of a lead cathepsin S compound in late 2001. 

 Bayer (Tryptase Inhibitors/Asthma/Preclinical)  

    In 1994, Axys entered into an agreement with Bayer for the research and development of tryptase inhibitors for the treatment of asthma. Tryptase is a serine
protease that has been shown to regulate inflammation. Tryptase is released by mast cells as part of an immune response to allergens such as pollen, mold or grasses and contributes to several
biological events that result in inflammation. Axys' tryptase inhibitors are designed to slow or halt the inflammatory process at an early stage, in an attempt to provide safe and effective therapies
for the treatment of the underlying cause of disease, rather than the symptoms. The most significant indication for tryptase inhibitors is allergic asthma, as a replacement for inhaled steroid
therapies. 

    Asthma
is characterized by generalized airway inflammation and tightness in the lungs (bronchoconstriction) that makes breathing difficult. Five percent of the United States
population, or approximately 13 million people, are estimated to suffer from some form of asthma. The exact causes of asthma are not well understood, and current treatments for asthma include
controlling inflammation through the use of inhaled steroids, treating airway constriction through the use of bronchodilators and prevention of asthma attacks through the daily use of oral leukotriene
inhibitors. 

    In
Axys' collaboration with Bayer, Axys has established human proof-of-concept for tryptase as a drug target. This was achieved in previous Phase II clinical
studies of APC 366, an inhaled peptide tryptase inhibitor, which showed that inhibiting tryptase resulted in improved breathing (reduction in late airway response) in asthmatics. Bayer is currently in
preclinical studies with a later generation small molecule tryptase inhibitor with high oral bioavailability and circulating half-life, with the goal of developing a
once-a-day oral therapeutic for the prevention and chronic treatment of asthma. 

 No Current Partner (Factors VIIa & Xa Inhibitors/Blood Clotting Disorders/Preclinical)  

    In September 1995, Axys signed a collaboration agreement with the predecessor to Pharmacia Corporation to develop oral therapeutics for blood clotting
disorders, such as deep vein thrombosis, stroke, and myocardial infarction. More specifically, Axys had been performing research on inhibitors of Factors Xa and VIIa and thrombin, all of which are
serine proteases involved in the blood clotting 

process. These proteases have been acknowledged as targets for a host of disorders related to abnormal clotting. Annually, more than 2 million people are hospitalized in the United States for
deep vein thrombosis, acute myocardial infarction and unstable angina. 

    In
July 1998 the research support for this collaboration ended and in February 1999 Axys formally agreed to end this collaboration. Axys is currently continuing its
research efforts with a focus on Factor VIIa and is actively seeking a new partner for the Factor VIIa program. At the present time, Axys is continuing to work on potent and selective compounds, which
could result in the nomination of a clinical candidate.

Additional
trials require further preclinical testing as described below. 

    In
early 1999, Axys implemented an initiative to focus its unpartnered resources on the development of small molecule therapeutics for the treatment of cancer. Axys believes that
there is a significant market opportunity to meet current and future medical needs associated with many different types of cancer. One of the factors contributing to this growth is the aging of the
world's population. As people live longer, their chances of developing cancer increase. 

    Axys'
decision to focus its resources on cancer therapeutics was also partly based on the improving regulatory environment for approval of cancer therapeutics. In recent years, the
Food & Drug Administration has established a regulatory "fast track" for some cancer therapeutics approved reviews. In addition, surrogate markers such as tumor shrinkage have been increasingly
accepted as research endpoints. The use of surrogate markers may substantially shorten the length of the necessary clinical research studies. 

    Further,
Axys believes that protease inhibition may provide a treatment method for many cancers, resulting in orally delivered small molecule therapeutics. These include
antiangiogenesis, hypoxia and metastasis inhibition. Angiogenesis is the process by which blood vessels are formed. Blood vessel formation and growth is necessary for tumor growth. Antiangiogenesis
drugs are believed to be able to cut off blood vessel growth and thereby reduce the size of tumors and potentially interfere with their growth. Hypoxia is the deprivation of oxygen to tumor cells,
which can lead to the inhibition of tumor cell proliferation. Metastasis is the process by which cancer spreads. Drugs that discourage metastasis are believed to be able to stop cancer from spreading
throughout the body. 

    Axys
has had research programs underway that range from a preclinical program in antiangiogenesis to screening and proof-of-concept programs in solid tumor
metastasis and prostate cancer, to cancer target identification and validation research programs. 

    Urokinase.
  One of Axys' most advanced oncology programs involves the development of inhibitors of the protease
urokinase to interfere with angiogenesis and metastasis processes. Utilizing a broad range of scientific capabilities including crystallography and structural biology, Axys' scientists have
extensively analyzed urokinase to identify sites on the molecule best suited for drug interaction. Using Axys' medicinal chemistry and structure-based drug design capabilities, a series of
drug-like compounds have been screened to identify potential drugs and select a candidate for preclinical development. 

    Axys'
lead series of urokinase inhibition drug candidates have been shown in preclinical testing to be potent and specific which may reduce the chance of unwanted side effects. The
results to date of Axys' tests in animal models show that urokinase may be required for tumor metastasis, and preclinical studies have shown activity of a urokinase inhibitor in animal models. Axys
plans to select an IND candidate from the urokinase inhibition program later in 2001, if the results obtained in animal studies in pancreatic cancer, in collaboration with the Arizona Cancer Center,
are successful. 

    SERM-b.
  Axys' first in-licensed program in oncology comes from Celgene (formerly Signal
Pharmaceuticals). In October 1999, Celgene granted Axys exclusive rights to their selective estrogen receptor-beta modulators (SERM-b) for the treatment of cancer.
SERM-b compounds are small molecules that selectively modulate the activity of the newly discovered beta estrogen receptor found in tumors and certain hormonally sensitive tissues.
Preclinical studies in animal models of prostate cancer are expected to continue throughout 2001. 

    Apoptosis Inducers.
  In early 2000, Axys entered into a collaborative agreement with Cytovia, Inc. (later
acquired by Maxim Pharmaceuticals, Inc.) to discover and develop inducers of apoptosis (programmed cell death) as anticancer drugs. During 2000, the research involved the screening of Axys
diversity libraries (approximately 400,000 compounds) through Maxim's proprietary assay systems designed to identify potential drug candidates. Lead compounds are expected to advance into animal
studies in cancer models during 2001. 

    Screening/Proof-of-Concept.
  Particular areas of emphasis in Axys' early-stage research include
hypoxia and angiogenesis. Biological targets identified in these pathways can be validated as small-molecule drug targets through additional molecular biology and eventual screening. In 2000, six
oncology targetshistone deactylase, methionine aminopeptidase-2, MT1-MMP, HIF1-(Greek alpha), rho kinase and CAAX proteasewere entered
into high throughput screening by this process. Some of these targets are no longer being pursued and other replacement targets will be entered into high throughput screening. Two additional protease
targets, prostate-specific antigen (PSA) and cathepsin V, are being validated in vivo using antisense and chemical inhibitor approaches. 

    In
addition to these programs, Axys is continuing to actively seek to license potential cancer treatment compounds from other biotechnology or pharmaceutical companies with an
emphasis on early stage clinical product opportunities, as well as advanced pre-clinical compounds. 

    Tryptase Inhibitors/Inflammatory Ulcerative Colitis/Clinical Phase II).
  In July 1997, Axys modified its 1994
research and development agreement with Bayer to re-acquire the rights to develop tryptase inhibitors for the treatment of inflammatory bowel disease and psoriasis, which, like asthma, is
another mast cell regulated inflammatory disease. In December 2000, Axys amended its collaborative agreement with Bayer to return exclusive rights to develop a specific tryptase inhibitor, APC
2059, for non-oral applications. Axys is investigating development of the compound as a potential inhaled therapy for asthma and as an injectable treatment for ulcerative colitis. Axys'
collaboration with Bayer to develop oral tryptase inhibitors is unaffected by this amendment. The January 2001 amended agreement provided for an up front payment to Bayer and future royalty
payments, based on net sales, upon commercialization. 

    In
the fourth quarter of 2000, Axys completed a Phase II clinical trial on Axys' compound, APC 2059, in ulcerative colitis. Before moving forward to more advanced trials, Axys has
recently 

determined that extensive safety pharmacology and dose-ranging pre-clinical research is necessary. Axys determined that it would not undertake this research and intends to seek
a partner who is willing to conduct this research, as well as undertake additional clinical and commercial activities. As these clinical trials are intended to establish safety in humans, Axys cannot
be certain that it will be able to initiate or complete necessary future clinical trials successfully. Axys' collaboration partner, Bayer, is moving forward with advanced pre-clinical
studies of a compound developed in Axys' collaboration with them for the treatment of asthma that would be taken as a pill. Axys cannot be certain that the clinical trials of this compound will be
initiated or completed successfully. Finally, Axys cannot be certain that any other drug candidates which may enter clinical trials will successfully complete those trials or that Axys or its
collaborators will be able to show the safety and effectiveness of these drug candidates. 

    Axys
is currently evaluating further development of APC 2059. To enable longer term dosing required for chronic disease therapies, Axys is currently in the process of planning
additional dose-ranging safety pharmacology studies. Axys expects further human clinical testing, if any, to be delayed until these safety pharmacology studies are completed and results
evaluated. 

Why and How Has Axys Leveraged its Technology Platform?  

    If the merger is not consummated, Axys will need additional capital in order to continue its research and development efforts. One way Axys has attempted to
raise additional capital is by creating new stand-alone companies using Axys' non-core technologies for purposes other than drug discovery,
obtaining third party funding for these companies and eventually selling its equity interest. Axys has created three such businesses: Advanced Technologies in combinatorial chemistry, PPGx, in
pharmacogenomics, and Akkadix in agricultural biotechnology. At the same time, Axys retains the right to use Axys' intellectual property that these businesses utilize for its' own drug discovery and
development purposes. 

    Axys
has sought out third parties to invest additional capital for these businesses, but retained equity ownership positions. In 2000, Axys sold its equity position in two of these
businesses: Advanced Technologies, which Axys sold to Discovery Partners, and PPGx, which Axys sold to DNA Sciences. 

    While
Axys believes that it will be successful in realizing meaningful value from these affiliated businesses, Axys' ability to do so will depend on the success these companies have
in executing their business strategies. Axys currently owns 7,246,500 shares of Discovery Partners common stock, 1,478,550 of Series D Preferred Stock of DNA Sciences and 108 shares of DNA
Sciences common stock. Axys' Discovery Partners shares are subject to certain contractual restrictions that limit Axys' ability to liquidate its position. DNA Sciences is a privately held company and
there are limited opportunities to dispose of Axys' interest. There can be no assurance that the businesses in which Axys holds these equity positions will be successful or that Axys will have the
ability to sell all or a portion of its equity ownership in these businesses. In addition, there can be no assurance that the amount Axys may receive upon selling its equity ownership interest will
provide significant funding so as to postpone for a meaningful time period the need to engage in other capital raising activities. 

Competition  

    Axys faces intense competition in the different market segments it is pursuing. There are many companies that have or are developing capabilities in drug
discovery, particularly in structure-based drug design and high throughput screening, to identify new products. In addition, there are many companies focused on the development of drugs for chronic
disease, such as osteoperosis, asthma, rheumatoid arthritis, ulcerative colitis, and for cancer in general. Many biotechnology companies are expanding their capabilities, using a variety of
techniques, to determine gene function and to develop products based on gene function. Axys' potential competitors in the field are numerous and include 

major pharmaceutical and agricultural companies, diagnostic companies, specialized biotechnology companies, genomics companies and academic institutions and universities. 

    Many
of Axys' potential competitors have significantly more financial, technical and other resources than it does, which may allow them to have a competitive advantage. Axys is aware
that there are many companies focused specifically on other proprietary technologies directed at identifying product targets. In addition, pharmaceutical, biotechnology and genomics companies and
academic institutions are
conducting work in this field. In the future, Axys expects the field to become more competitive with companies and academic institutions seeking to develop competing technologies. 

    Any
products that Axys may develop or discover through application of its technologies will compete in highly competitive markets. Many of Axys' potential competitors in these markets
have substantially greater financial, technical and personnel resources than Axys does, and Axys cannot assure you that they will not succeed in developing technologies and products that may render
Axys' technologies and products and those of Axys' collaborators obsolete or noncompetitive. In addition, many of Axys' competitors have significantly greater experience than Axys does in their
respective fields. 

Patents and Proprietary Rights  

    Axys holds 27 issued United States patents and 28 issued foreign patents relating to compositions of matter, methods of treating disease, combinatorial
chemistry and computational technologies. Most of Axys' patents in combinatorial chemistry diversity library processes and compositions of matter have been assigned to Discovery Partners as part of
the sale of Advanced Technologies completed in 2000. These patents expire at various dates starting in year 2013 up to the year 2018. In addition, Axys has filed and there are now pending patent
applications relating to compositions of matter, methods of treating disease, assay techniques, computational technologies and novel technology for the discovery of novel protease inhibitors. Axys
intends to file additional patent applications, when appropriate, relating to Axys' technology and to specific products it develops. 

    Axys
strategically files selected patent applications to protect technology, inventions and improvements that are important to the development of Axys' business. That is Axys' policy,
as well as Axys' practice. Axys also relies upon trade secrets, know-how, continuing technological innovations and licensing opportunities to develop and maintain its competitive position.
Axys maintains a policy that it does not and will not knowingly violate valid claims of patents issued by the United States Patent and Trademark Office. 

    The
patent positions of pharmaceutical and biotechnology firms, including Axys, are uncertain and involve complex legal and factual questions. In addition, the scope of the claims in
a patent application can be significantly modified before the patent is issued. As a result, Axys does not know whether any of its applications will result in the issuance of patents, or if any of its
issued patents will provide significant protection. Axys also does not know whether any of its issued patents will be invalidated. Since patent applications in the United States are maintained in
secrecy until patents issue, and since publication of discoveries in the scientific or patent literature often lag behind actual discoveries, Axys cannot even be certain that it was the first creator
of inventions covered by its pending patent applications or that it was the first to file patent applications for such inventions. 

    In
addition, Axys may have to participate in interference proceedings declared by the United States Patent and Trademark Office. These proceedings determine the priority of invention
and the right to a
patent for the technology in the United States. Such proceedings could result in substantial costs to Axys, even if Axys wins. 

    There
can be no assurance that Axys' pending patent applications, if issued, or Axys' existing patents, will not be invalidated. An adverse outcome could subject Axys to significant
liabilities to third 

parties, require disputed rights to be licensed from third parties or require Axys to stop or modify its use of such technology. 

    The
development of therapeutic products for applications in the product fields Axys is pursuing is intensely competitive. A number of pharmaceutical companies, biotechnology
companies, universities and research institutions have filed patent applications or received patents in the areas in which Axys is conducting research. In addition, patent applications filed by others
relating to Axys' potential products or technologies may currently be pending. Some of these applications or patents may limit or hinder Axys' freedom to practice and could result in a significant
reduction of the coverage of Axys' patents, or potential patents. Axys is aware of pending patent applications that have been filed by other companies that may pertain to certain of Axys'
technologies. If patents are issued to these or other companies containing incompatible or conflicting claims, and such claims are ultimately determined to be valid, Axys may be required to obtain
licenses to these patents or to develop or obtain alternative technology. 

    Furthermore,
Axys has in the past been, and may again be, notified of claims that it may be infringing patents or other intellectual property rights owned by third parties. Axys has
obtained licenses under several patents held by third parties. If necessary or desirable, Axys may seek additional licenses under other patents or intellectual property rights. There can be no
assurance, however, that Axys will be able to obtain a license it seeks on reasonable terms or even at all. As an alternative, Axys could decide to resort to litigation to challenge a patent or
patents. Such challenges can be extremely expensive and time consuming. Consequently, they could have a material adverse effect on Axys' business, financial condition and results of operations. 

    Much
of the unpatentable know-how important to Axys' technology and many of its processes depends upon the knowledge, experience and skills of key scientific and technical
personnel. To protect Axys' rights to this know-how and technology, all employees, consultants, advisors and collaborators are required to enter into confidentiality agreements with Axys
that prohibit the disclosure of confidential information to any third party and require disclosure to Axys of ideas, developments, discoveries and inventions made by these individuals. There can be no
assurance that these agreements will effectively prevent disclosure of Axys' confidential information or that these agreements will provide meaningful protection for Axys' confidential information if
there is unauthorized use or disclosure. Axys' business could be adversely affected by competitors who develop substantially equivalent technology. 

    In
connection with certain research, Axys entered into sponsored research agreements with various researchers and universities. Generally, under these agreements Axys funds the
research of investigators in exchange for the right or an option to a license to any patentable inventions that may result in designated areas. Axys is obligated to make certain payments during the
terms of certain of the agreements, to pay royalties on net sales of any licensed products and, in some cases, to negotiate in good faith the business terms of any license executed upon exercise of
licensing options. There can be no assurance that these agreements will not be breached or that Axys would have adequate remedies for any breach. 

Government Regulation  

    The manufacturing and marketing of Axys' proposed products and Axys' research and development activities are subject to regulation for safety, effectiveness
and quality by many governmental authorities in the United States and other countries. In the United States, drugs are subject to stringent regulation by the United States Food and Drug
Administration. The Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act and Food and Drug Administration regulations, as well as other federal and state laws and regulations, govern the testing, manufacture,
safety, effectiveness, package labeling, storage, record keeping, approval, advertising and promotion of Axys' proposed products. Product development and approval takes a long time and involves the
expenditure of a lot of money. If Axys fails to comply with certain 

regulatory requirements, Axys could be subject to sanctions, such as warning letters, penalties, criminal prosecution, injunctions, product seizure, product recalls, total or partial suspension of
production, and Food and Drug Administration refusal to approve pending NDAs or costly supplements to approved applications. 

    The
steps required before a drug may be marketed in the United States include (1) preclinical laboratory tests, in vivo (animal model) preclinical studies and formulation
studies, (2) the submission to the Food and Drug Administration of an application for human clinical testing, known as an Investigational New Drug Application (which we refer to in this
proxy statement/prospectus as INDs), which must be accepted by the Food and Drug Administration before human clinical trials are started, (3) adequate and well-controlled
human clinical trials to establish the safety and effectiveness of the drug, (4) the submission of an NDA to the Food and Drug Administration, and (5) Food and Drug
Administration approval of the NDA prior to any commercial sale or shipment of the drug. In addition to obtaining Food and Drug Administration approval for each product, each domestic drug
manufacturing establishment must be registered with the Food and Drug Administration. Domestic drug manufacturing establishments are subject to inspections twice a year by the Food and
Drug Administration and must comply with Good Manufacturing Practices. To supply products for use in the United States, foreign manufacturers must comply with Good Manufacturing Practices and are
subject to periodic inspection by the Food and Drug Administration or by corresponding regulatory agencies in their country. Drug product manufacturers located in California also must be
licensed by the State of California. 

    Preclinical
tests include laboratory evaluation of what is in the product and how it was made, as well as animal studies to assess the potential safety and effectiveness of the
product. Preclinical safety tests must be conducted by laboratories that comply with Food and Drug Administration regulations regarding Good Laboratory Practices. The results of the preclinical
tests are submitted to the Food and Drug Administration as part of an IND and reviewed by the Food and Drug Administration prior to the start of human clinical trials. Unless the
Food and Drug Administration objects, the IND will become effective 30 days following its receipt by the Food and Drug Administration. There can be no assurance that submission of
an IND will result in Food and Drug Administration authorization to start clinical trials. Clinical trials involve giving the investigational new drug to healthy volunteers and to patients,
under the supervision of qualified investigators. Clinical trials are conducted in agreement with Good Clinical Practices under instructions that detail the objectives of the study, the limits to be
used to monitor safety and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated. Instructions must be submitted to the Food and Drug Administration as part of the IND. Further, each clinical study must
be conducted under the power of an independent institutional review board at the site where the study will be conducted. The institutional review board will consider, among other things, ethical
factors, the safety of human subjects and the possible liability of the site. 

    Clinical
trials are typically conducted in three phases that go in order, but the phases may overlap. In Phase I, in which Axys usually gives the drug to healthy subjects, the drug is
tested to determine its metabolism (how the drug is absorbed by the body), pharmacokinetics (what the body does to the drug) and pharmacological actions (biological effects) in humans, the side
effects associated with increasing doses and early evidence of how effective the drug is, if possible. Phase II involves studies in a limited patient population to (1) determine the
effectiveness of the drug for specific, targeted indications, (2) determine what amount of the drug works best and how much of the drug can be tolerated, and (3) identify possible
adverse effects and safety risks. If a compound is found to be effective and to have an acceptable safety profile in Phase II evaluations, Phase III trials further evaluate the effectiveness of the
drug and further test for safety in a larger group of people at many different locations. 

    There
can be no assurance that Phase I, Phase II or Phase III testing will be completed successfully within any specific time period, if at all, for any of Axys' proposed products.
Furthermore, the Food and Drug Administration or Axys may suspend or cancel clinical trials at any time if it is felt 

that the patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk or the Food and Drug Administration finds errors or incorrect information in the IND or due to the conduct of the
investigation. Further, Food and Drug Administration regulations state that sponsors of clinical investigations must meet numerous regulatory requirements, including, selection of qualified
investigators, proper monitoring of the investigations, recordkeeping and record retention, and ensuring that Food and Drug Administration and all investigators are promptly informed of
significant new adverse effects or risks with respect to the drug. 

    The
results of the drug development, preclinical studies and clinical studies are submitted to the Food and Drug Administration in the form of an NDA, which, if accepted, would
clear the way for marketing and commercial shipment of the drug. There can be no assurance that any approval will be granted by the Food and Drug Administration at all or, if granted, will be
granted on a timely basis. The Food and Drug Administration may deny an NDA if certain regulatory criteria are not satisfied, may require additional testing or information, or may require
post-marketing testing and surveillance to monitor the safety of Axys' products if the Food and Drug Administration does not view the NDA as containing enough evidence of the safety
and effectiveness of the drug. Even if Axys submits additional data, the Food and Drug Administration may still decide that the application does not satisfy its regulatory criteria for
approval. In addition, even if regulatory clearance of a drug is granted, such approval may limit the uses for which it may be marketed. Finally, product approvals may be taken away if regulatory
standards are not maintained or if problems occur following initial marketing. 

    Among
the typical conditions for NDA approval is the requirement that the proposed manufacturer's quality control and manufacturing procedures conform to Good Manufacturing Practices,
which must be followed at all times. To comply with these standards, Axys will have to spend a large amount of time, money and effort in the area of production and quality control to ensure full
technical compliance. 

    In
addition to regulations enforced by the Food and Drug Administration, Axys will also be subject to regulation under the Occupational Safety and Health Act, the Environmental
Protection Act, the Toxic Substances Control Act, the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act and other present and potential future federal, state or local regulations. Axys' research and development
involves the controlled use of hazardous materials, chemicals and various radioactive compounds, all of which are regulated. Although Axys believes that Axys' safety procedures for handling and
disposing of these materials comply with the standards set by state and federal regulations, the risk of accidental contamination or injury from these materials is possible. In the event of an
accident, Axys could be sued for any damages that result and any such lawsuit could exceed the insurance and resources of Axys. 

    For
clinical investigation and marketing outside the United States, Axys is also subject to foreign regulatory requirements governing human clinical trials and marketing approval for
drugs. These requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary widely for European countries both within, and outside, the European Union. Axys
plans to comply with the European regulatory process by identifying and using clinical investigators in the member states of the European Union and other European countries to conduct clinical
studies. Further, Axys intends to design Axys' studies to meet Food and Drug Administration, European Union and other European countries' standards. 

    Within
the European Union, while marketing authorizations must be supported by clinical trial data of a type and to the extent set out by European Union directives and guidelines, the
approval process for the commencement of clinical trials is not currently harmonized by European Union law and varies from country to country. As far as possible, Axys intends to design Axys' studies
so as to develop a regulatory package sufficient for multi-country approval in Axys' European target markets, without the need to duplicate studies for individual country approvals. 

    Outside the United States, Axys' ability to market a product is based upon receiving a marketing authorization from the appropriate regulatory authority. Currently, foreign marketing
authorizations are applied for at a national level, although within the European Union certain registration procedures are available to companies wishing to market the product in more than one
European Union member state. If the regulatory authority is satisfied that enough evidence of safety, quality and effectiveness has been presented, a marketing authorization will be granted. The
system for obtaining marketing authorizations within the European Union changed on January 1, 1995. The current European Union registration system is a dual one in which certain products, such
as biotechnology and high technology products and those containing new active substances, will have access to a central regulatory system that provides registration throughout the entire European
Union. Other products will be registered by national authorities in individual European Union member states, operating on a principle of mutual recognition. This foreign regulatory approval process
includes all of the same risks involved in the Food and Drug Administration approval process described above. 

Employees  

    As of May 31, 2001, Axys employed 161 individuals, of whom 57 held Ph.D. or M.D. degrees and 39 held other advanced degrees. Approximately 130 of Axys'
employees are involved in research and development activities, including a variety of disciplines within the areas of molecular biology and other biological sciences, medicinal chemistry,
bioinformatics, computer sciences pharmacology, safety assessment and clinical development. Approximately 31 of Axys' employees are employed in finance, business development and general administrative
activities. None of Axys' employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements, and Axys' management considers relations with its employees to be good. Axys also enters into consulting
arrangements with experienced, professional scientists and managers to supplement Axys' work force. 

Recent Developments  

    In November 2000, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Emerging Issues Task Force Issue No. 00-27, "Application of EITF
Issue No. 98-5, Accounting for Convertible Securities with Beneficial Conversion Features or Contingently Adjustable Conversion Ratios, to Certain Convertible Instruments". This
established new accounting rules that were applicable immediately to Axys' $26 million convertible debt instrument Axys issued in September 2000. The new accounting rule required Axys to
record a $4 million beneficial conversion feature charge during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2000. 

    On
March 8, 2001, Axys issued a press release that announced Axys' unaudited financial results for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2000. Axys' March 8, 2001
reported results did not recognize the entire $4 million non-cash charge for the beneficial conversion feature as Axys was amortizing the beneficial conversion feature over the four
year term of the debt. The immediate charge resulting from this accounting rule, which applies to transactions entered into prior to November 16, 2000, does not impact Axys' reported operating
loss, but results in a one-time, non-cash charge to interest expense in connection with the issuance of the convertible debt. As a result, Axys reported in the press release,
for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2000, basic and diluted net loss per share from continuing operations and basic and diluted net (loss) income per share of ($1.18) and $0.39,
respectively. After recognizing the entire $4 million beneficial conversion feature, Axys' basic and diluted net loss per share from continuing operations and basic and diluted net (loss)
income per share, for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2000, was ($1.29) and $0.28, respectively. Axys does not believe that this change will have any material impact on Axys' operations or
financial condition. 

Properties  

    Axys currently leases approximately 170,000 square feet and occupies approximately 111,000 square feet of laboratory, support and administrative space in South
San Francisco, California. Leases expire on these facilities on November 30, 2003 with respect to approximately 52,000 square feet; on July 31, 2005 on approximately 33,000 square feet;
on August 4, 2006 on approximately 83,000 square feet and on a month to month arrangement on approximately 2,000 square feet. Most of these leases have additional options for extensions. In
2000, Axys converted a warehouse lease into a ground lease for 25 years with options to extend for two additional 10-year periods. Axys is constructing a medicinal chemistry
building on this lot that will include approximately 43,500 square feet of laboratory and office space. Construction is expected to be completed in the second half of 2001. Axys is subleasing
approximately 33,000 square feet to an unrelated third party, with the lease and sublease expiring on July 31, 2005. In addition, Axys is subleasing approximately 25,000 square feet to
Discovery Partners, with the lease and sublease expiring on November 30, 2003. Axys expects to sublease 52,000 square feet of adjacent space to Discovery Partners when Axys occupies the new
medicinal chemistry facility. Discovery Partners also has the right of first refusal to sublease the remainder of that 52,000 square foot facility or approximately 25,000 square feet upon the opening
of the new medicinal chemistry facility. Axys' existing and planned facilities are believed to be adequate to meet Axys' present requirements, and Axys currently believes that suitable additional
space will be available to Axys, when needed, on commercially reasonable terms. 

Legal Proceedings  

    From time to time, Axys is subject to legal proceedings or claims arising in the ordinary course of its business. While the outcome of any such proceedings or
claims cannot be predicted with certainty, Axys' management does not believe that the outcome of any of these legal matters will have a material adverse effect on Axys' results of operations or

Axys Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  

You should read the following discussion of the financial condition and results of operations in conjunction with Axys' financial
statements and its notes located elsewhere in this proxy statement/prospectus. The following discussion contains both historical information and forward-looking statements that involve risks and
uncertainties. Forward-looking statements include projections and other statements of events that may occur at some point in the future. Axys' actual results could differ significantly from those
described in the forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include, but are not limited to, those discussed in this section as well as under "Information
About Axys" and "Risk Factors" in this proxy statement/prospectus.

Overview  

    Axys is a biopharmaceutical company focused on the discovery, design and development of therapeutic small molecules that address significant markets with major
unmet medical needs. Axys collaborates with large pharmaceutical companies in discovering therapeutics for chronic diseases for which there are large markets. Axys also selectively focuses its
resources on discovering and developing therapeutics for the treatment of various types of cancer and other specialty market therapeutics. Axys has on-going programs in the treatment of
autoimmune, inflammatory diseases, and cancer. Axys' drug 

design platform integrates advanced biology, chemistry, biophysics and information technologies to optimize the potency, selectivity and physical properties of new drugs, making the drug discovery
process more efficient and productive. 

    In
February 2001, Axys received a research milestone payment from Merck & Co. for meeting a pre-agreed milestone in the development of a compound being
studied for use in the treatment of osteoporosis, a disease that affects an estimated 40 percent of women over the age of 50. The compound selected by Merck is a potent and selective inhibitor
of Cathepsin K, a cysteine protease that has been demonstrated to play a key role in bone resorption. 

    In
March 2001, Axys recorded revenue from a research milestone from Aventis, for successfully completing a pivotal 
in
vivo
 proof-of-concept study that confirmed the mechanism of action for orally administered inhibitors of Cathepsin S, another human
cysteine protease. The collaboration with Aventis is focused on development of Cathepsin S inhibitors for potential applications in treating inflammation and autoimmune disease, including rheumatoid
arthritis, asthma, atherosclerosis, COPD and rhinitis. 

    Also
in March 2001, two investors in Akkadix Corporation exercised options, extended to them by Axys, to exchange their 2.7 million shares of Series A Preferred
Stock of Akkadix for approximately 2.5 million shares of Axys common stock. The fair market value of Axys' common stock exchanged for Akkadix preferred stock was approximately
$9.0 million. As a result of the exercise of these options, Axys' ownership of Akkadix voting stock increased from 31% to approximately 44%. During the first quarter of 2001, Akkadix sharply
reduced its operations because of diminished financial resources. A substantial percentage of its employees were terminated and Akkadix vacated its office/laboratory space. Axys has concluded that the
future viability of the Akkadix business is highly uncertain. Accordingly, in conformance with the equity method of accounting, Axys incurred a non-cash charge of $9.0 million
during the quarter recognizing an impairment in the value of our investment in Akkadix. Axys does not anticipate any future benefit from this investment. 

    To
date, Axys has not generated any product revenue from our drug discovery programs and does not expect to generate product revenue for at least several years. As of March 31,
2001, Axys had an accumulated deficit of $285 million. Axys expects that losses will fluctuate from quarter to quarter, that such fluctuations may be substantial, and that results from prior
quarters may not be indicative of future operating results. Included Axys' accumulated deficit at March 31, 2001 was approximately $147 million of acquired in-process
research and development from the acquisitions of Khepri Pharmaceuticals, Inc. in 1995 and Sequana Therapeutics, Inc. in January 1998. Axys expects its sources of revenue, if any,
for the next several years to consist of payments under corporate partnerships. The process of developing its products will require significant additional research and development, preclinical testing
and clinical trials, as well as regulatory approval. These activities, together with our general and administrative expenses are expected to result in significant operating losses for the foreseeable
future. Axys will not receive product revenues or royalties from its collaborative partners before completing clinical trials and successfully commercializing these products. 

    Axys
is subject to risks common to biopharmaceutical companies, including risks inherent in its research and development efforts and clinical trials, reliance on collaborative
partners, enforcement of patent and proprietary rights, the need for future capital, potential competition and uncertainty of regulatory approvals. In order for a product to be commercialized, it will
be necessary for Axys, and in some cases, its collaborators, to conduct preclinical tests and clinical trials to demonstrate the efficacy and safety of its product candidates, obtain regulatory
clearances and enter into manufacturing, distribution and marketing arrangements as well as obtain market acceptance. There can be no assurance that Axys will generate revenues or achieve and sustain
profitability in the future. 

Results of Operations  

Three Months ended March 31, 2001 and March 31, 2000  

 Collaboration and Licensing Revenues  

    Axys' collaboration and licensing revenues were $3.1 million for the three months ended March 31, 2001, compared to $1.4 million for the
same period in 2000. The increase was primarily due to milestones earned from corporate collaborations with both Merck and Aventis. 

 Research and Development  

    Axys' research and development expenses were $8.9 million for the three months ended March 31, 2001, compared to $7.9 million for the same
period in 2000. The overall increase for the first three months of 2001 was primarily due to clinical development expenses incurred in connection with clinical studies for APC 2059. 

 General and Administrative  

    Axys' general and administrative expenses were $3.2 million for the three months ended March 31, 2001, compared to $2.8 million for the
same period in 2000. The increase was primarily due to upgrading Axys' information systems and network infrastructure. 

 Non-cash compensation income  

    Axys recorded non-cash compensation income of $1.1 million for the three months ended March 31, 2001, relating to its 1999 Key
Personnel Stock Option Plan. Axys recorded a credit as a result of the decline in fair value of the company's liability under the Key Stock Option Employee Plan. Under this plan, certain employees of
Axys have been granted contractual options to purchase shares of our investment of Discovery Partners International, Inc. 

 Interest Income and Interest Expense  

    Interest income was $531,000 for the three months ended March 31, 2001, compared to $141,000 for the same period in 2000. The increase was primarily due
to the increase in average cash investment balances during the first quarter of 2001, compared to the first quarter of 2000. Interest expense was $1,474,000 for the three months ended March 31,
2001, compared to $176,000 for the same period in 2000. The increase in the first quarter was primarily due to the interest expense on the subordinated notes payable. Interest expense on these notes
consists of the 8% face value interest rate and the amortization of debt issuance costs. 

 Equity Interest in Loss of Equity-Method Investee  

    Axys recorded a $9.1 million loss in connection with its equity method investees during the three months ended March 31, 2001. This loss reflects
Axys' pro rata share loss from its investments in Discovery Partners and the write off of Axys' remaining investment in Akkadix. 

 Other Expense  

    Other expense was $978,000 for the three months ended March 31, 2001, compared to none for the same period in 2000. The amount represents the change in
fair value of the warrants received as part of Axys' investment in Discovery Partners in conformity with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 133, "Accounting for Derivative
Instruments and Hedging Activities" adopted in January 2001. 

Years Ended December 31, 2000 and 1999  

 1999 Events Which Affected Comparability with 2000:  

    In December 1999, Axys closed its La Jolla operations, which primarily represented the Sequana business acquired in 1998, and relocated Axys' oncology
genomics research activities to its South San Francisco headquarters. As a result of this action, a one-time restructuring charge of $5.2 million was recorded in 1999. At the time
of the Sequana acquisition, the following research programs were in progress: Asthma, partnered with Boehringer Ingelheim GmbH; Osteoporosis, partnered with Corange International Ltd.
(currently F. HoffmannLa Roche Ltd.); Non-Insulin Dependent Diabetes Mellitus, partnered with GlaxoWellcome (currently Glaxo SmithKline, Inc.);
Schizophrenia/Bipolar, partnered with Parke-Davis (currently Pfizer, Inc.) Pharmaceutical Research division of Warner-Lambert Company; and the unpartnered programs in Obesity, Alzheimer's and
Pharmacogenomics. As of December 31, 1999, the Schizophrenia/Bipolar program was transferred to Parke-Davis and the Pharmacogenomics program was spun off into the PPGx subsidiary with PPD. All
other programs have ended. 

    In
September 1999, Akkadix completed its acquisition of Global Agro, Inc. The acquisition resulted in Axys' equity ownership interest in Akkadix falling below 50% and
thereafter Akkadix is accounted for under the equity method. 

    In
February 1999, Axys formed a majority owned subsidiary, PPGx, which was engaged in the business of providing pharmacogenomic (the science of how genetic variations among
individuals affects drug safety and efficacy) products and services to the pharmaceutical industry. In connection with the formation of PPGx, Axys contributed certain assets and technology in exchange
for an 82% ownership interest in PPGx. PPD, Inc. acquired an 18% equity interest in PPGx, in exchange for contributing certain assets, technology, cash and loan guarantees and the exclusive,
worldwide right to market the pharmacogenomic products and services of PPGx. 

 2000 Events Which Affected Axys' Operations:  

    During 2000, Axys completed the sale of two of its three non-core subsidiary businesses created several years ago from Axys' technology. Axys
obtained equity from the acquiring companies in consideration
for the sale of these entities. Axys plans to liquidate these equity shares over time to fund Axys' future research and development. The transactions involved are: 


the
sale of Advanced Technologies to Discovery Partners, resulting in consideration to Axys of 7,425,000 shares of Discovery Partners common stock; and


the
sale of PPGx to DNA Sciences, resulting in consideration to Axys of 1,478,550 shares of Series D preferred stock and 108 shares of common stock. 

 Events That Happened Subsequent to 2000, Which Will Affect Axys in the Future:  

    Akkadix (formerly known as Xyris) focuses its business on agricultural biotechnology. In 1999, The Bay City Capital Fund I, L.P. and an affiliated fund, North
American Nutrition & Agribusiness Fund, L.P., became a primary source of funding for Akkadix. In 2000, Axys and Bay City Capital each provided Akkadix with bridge loan financing of
$2.5 million, which Axys subsequently increased by another $100,000. In accordance with the equity method of accounting, Axys recorded a charge of approximately $2.8 million in 2000,
representing Axys' share of Akkadix's losses and substantially all of Axys' investment in Akkadix. 

    In
March 2001, Bay City Capital and North American Nutrition & Agribusiness Fund each exercised its option to exchange its shares of Akkadix preferred stock for shares
of Axys common stock. These option exercises increased Axys' ownership interest in Akkadix from 23% at December 31, 2000 

to 44% in March 2001. Axys does not expect to receive any future value, nor is it planning to make future investments in Akkadix and its future viability as a business is very uncertain. As a
result of Axys' ownership interest in Akkadix, Axys recorded a non-cash charge of $9 million in the first quarter of 2001. 

 Collaboration and Licensing Revenues for 2000 Compared to 1999  

    Axys' collaborative research programs generally contain one or more of the following sources of revenue to Axys: 


Research Support:
 payments that are generally based on the number of researchers Axys is
committing to a particular program. These revenues are recorded when earned through the performance of the required research by Axys.


License Fees:
 payments that are generally received when the collaboration agreement is
signed. These revenues are amortized over the term of the agreement.


Milestone Payments:
 payments that are based on Axys or its partner achieving certain
technical or regulatory milestones in the collaboration. Milestone payments are recorded as revenues upon the achievement of mutually agreed upon milestones. 

    Axys'
collaboration and licensing revenues decreased to $7.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2000, from $24.1 million in 1999. Collaboration and licensing
revenues (which generally consist of research support and license fees), for the year ended December 31, 2000 were attributable to collaborative research agreements with: 


Aventis
Pharmaceutical Products, Inc. for the development of small molecule therapeutics that inhibit cathepsin S, associated with certain
inflammatory diseases and


Merck &
Co., Inc. for the development of small molecule inhibitors of proteases involved in osteoporosis. 

    Revenues
in 2000 decreased when compared to 1999 as the following collaborative research programs were concluded: 


the
Boehringer Ingelheim International GmbH gene identification program in asthma


the
Parke-Davis (currently known as Pfizer, Inc.) gene identification program in schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, and


the
Bristol-Myers Squibb Company collaboration for the development of protease inhibitors involved in hepatitis C infection. 

 Research and Development Expenses for 2000 Compared to 1999  

    Axys' research and development expenses decreased to $36.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2000, from $55.2 million in 1999. The
decrease was primarily due to lower expenses as a result of the 1999 shutdown of Axys' La Jolla operation and lower headcount in 2000 from 1999 levels. 

 General and Administrative Expenses for 2000 Compared to 1999  

    Axys' general and administrative expenses were $10.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2000, compared to $10.9 million in 1999. The
decrease was primarily due to lower expenses as a result of the shut down of Axys' La Jolla operation in 1999. 

 Interest Income and Interest Expense for 2000 Compared to 1999  

    Interest income decreased to $1.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2000, from $2.3 million in 1999. The decrease was primarily due
to the decrease in average cash and investment balances between the periods. Interest expense increased to $5.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2000, from $2.0 in 1999. The
increase was due primarily to an embedded beneficial conversion charge of $4 million recorded in the fourth quarter of 2000. 

 Equity in Losses of Equity-Method Investee for 2000 Compared to 1999  

    Equity in losses of equity-method investee increased to $3.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2000 as compared to $0.8 million in
1999. The increase was primarily due to Axys expensing its $2.8 million investment in Akkadix during the fourth quarter of 2000. 

 Restructuring Charge in 2000 Compared to 1999  

    In December 1999, Axys completed the closing of Axys' La Jolla operations and relocated the oncology genomics research activities to the South San
Francisco headquarters. At December 31, 1999, $1.9 million remained in an accrual relating to this restructuring charge. During 2000, Axys revised its restructuring charge and reversed
approximately $592,000 of this accrual as a result of assigning the La Jolla facility lease to a third party. 

 Other Income/Expense in 2000 Compared to 1999  

    For the year 2000, Axys reported $0.9 million in other income related to the gain on sale of a portion of the common stock held as short term marketable
investments. This is an increase of $1.7 million from the $0.9 million other expenses that Axys reported in 1999 that was due to the write-off of Axys' 50% interest in Genos
Biosciences. 

Years Ended December 31, 1999 And 1998  

 Collaboration and Licensing Revenues for 1999 Compared to 1998  

    Axys' collaboration and licensing revenues decreased to $24.1 million for the year ended December 31, 1999, from $35.8 million in 1998.
Collaboration and licensing revenues (which generally consist of research support and license fees), for the year ended December 31, 1999 were attributable to the collaborative research
agreements with: Parke-Davis in the gene identification program in schizophrenia and bipolar disorder; Bristol-Myers Squibb for the development of protease inhibitors involved in hepatitis C
infection; Aventis for the development of small molecule therapeutics that inhibit cathepsin
S, associated with certain inflammatory diseases; and Merck for the development of small molecule inhibitors of proteases involved in osteoporosis. 1999 revenues decreased when compared to 1998 due to
lower revenues recognized under the following agreements: the end of research support in June 1999 under the Boehringer Ingelheim International GmbH agreement for the gene identification
program in asthma; the winding-down of the Parke-Davis gene identification program for schizophrenia and bipolar disorder; and the conclusion in mid-1998 of the Pharmacia
Corporation agreement for the development of inhibitors of Factor Xa. 

 Research and Development Expenses for 1999 Compared to 1998  

    Axys' research and development expenses decreased to $55.2 million for the year ended December 31, 1999, from $57.5 million in 1998. The
decrease is primarily due to reduced headcount in 1999. Research and development expenses in 1999 reflect a partial year of Akkadix activity. 

 General and Administrative Expenses for 1999 Compared to 1998  

    Axys' general and administrative expenses decreased to $10.9 million for the year ended December 31, 1999, from $13.4 million in 1998. The
decrease is primarily due to lower expenses as a result of the winding down of activities in Axys' La Jolla operation in 1999. 

 Interest Income and Interest Expense for 1999 Compared to 1998  

    Interest income decreased to $2.3 million for the year ended December 31, 1999, from $4.7 million in 1998. The decrease was primarily due
to the decrease in average cash and investment balances between the periods. Interest expense decreased to $2.0 million for the year ended December 31, 1999, from $2.4 million in
1998. The decrease was primarily due to the lower debt balances from Axys' lines of credit and existing leasing arrangements in 1999. 

 Equity in Losses of Equity Method Investee for 1999 Compared to 1998  

    Equity in losses of equity method investee decreased to $0.8 million for the year ended December 31, 1999 as compared to $2.4 million in
1998, and was due to the decrease in the loss for Genos Biosciences, Inc, Axys' joint venture with Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center. This amount represents Axys' 50% portion of Genos
Biosciences' loss for 1999. The decrease is primarily due to the winding down of operations of Genos Biosciences in May 1999. In the third quarter of 1999, Axys wrote off the balance of the
investment in Genos Biosciences. 

 Restructuring Charge for 1999 Compared to 1998  

    In December 1999, Axys completed the closing of its La Jolla operations and relocated its oncology genomics research activities to its South San
Francisco headquarters. As a result of this action, a one-time charge of $7.0 million was taken during the third quarter of 1999, of which $2.2 million related to severance
and other employee-related costs, $1.7 million related to facilities costs, $1.8 million related to the disposal of assets, and $1.3 million related to other costs associated with
the restructuring. In the fourth quarter of 1999, the restructuring charge was reduced by $1.8 million, to $5.2 million due to a change in estimates resulting from the additional
subleases of the La Jolla facility, and from proceeds from the disposal of equipment and other assets associated with closing down the La Jolla facility. The facilities costs include lease payments in
La Jolla net of proceeds from existing subleases. As a result of closing the facility, Axys eliminated 120 positions of which 93 were included in the severance calculation and 27 positions were
eliminated through attrition and cancellation of open requisitions. At December 31, 1999, the remaining accrual relating to the restructuring was approximately $1.9 million. 

 Other Income/Expense for 1999 Compared to 1998  

    Other expense reported in 1999 was $0.9 million compared to none reported in 1998. The difference is primarily due to the write-off of Axys'
50% interest in Genos Biosystems. 

Recent Accounting Pronouncements  

    In June 1998, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standard No. 133, "Accounting for Derivative
Instruments and Hedging Activities," which was required to be adopted in years beginning after June 15, 2000. Axys adopted the new Statement effective January 1, 2001. The Statement
requires Axys to recognize all derivatives on the balance sheet at fair value. Derivatives that are not hedges must be adjusted to fair value through income. If the derivative
is a hedge, depending on the nature of the hedge, changes in the fair value of derivatives will either be offset against the change in fair value of the hedged assets, liabilities, or firm commitments
through 

earnings or recognized in other comprehensive income until the hedged item is recognized in earnings. The ineffective portion of a derivative's change in fair value will be immediately recognized in
earnings. 

    Based
on Axys' derivative positions at December 31, 2000, which are limited to warrants to purchase common shares of Discovery Partners stock (see Note 2 to Axys'
financial statements commencing on page F-1 of the proxy statement/prospectus) and certain key employee contracts to acquire investments held by Axys (see Note 11 to Axys' financial
statements commencing on page F-1 of this proxy statement/prospectus), Axys recorded a cumulative effect of an accounting change of approximately $972,000 recognized in the statement of
operations in the first quarter of 2001. 

Liquidity And Capital Resources  

    Axys has financed its operations since inception primarily through private and public offerings of capital stock, through corporate collaborative research and
from a secured convertible note. As of March 31, 2001, Axys had accumulated, approximately $229 million in net proceeds from offerings of our capital stock. In addition, Axys has
accumulated approximately $183 million from our collaborative research agreements. 

    Our
principal sources of liquidity are Axys' cash and investments, which totaled $29.4 million on March 31, 2001. Included in our investments on March 31, 2001
were 35,450 shares of common stock., which are subject to a lock-up agreement that restricts its ability to sell the securities. The lock up expires in June 2001. 

    In
2000, Axys sold its Advanced Technologies subsidiary to Discovery Partners for approximately 7.4 million shares of Discovery Partners' common stock. Later in 2000, Axys sold
its interest in PPGx, Inc., to DNA Sciences, Inc. for approximately 1.5 million shares of Series D Preferred Stock. 

    Axys
used cash and cash equivalents of $10.9 million in its operations during the first quarter of 2001 compared to $11.9 million in the same period in 2000. 

    Axys
purchased approximately $2.1 million of property and equipment during the first quarter of 2001. Axys expects to acquire or lease additional equipment in connection with
future research and
development activities. Axys is also expending cash in the construction of its new 43,500 square foot medicinal chemistry building adjacent to its principal offices and laboratory buildings in South
San Francisco. Axys expects the building to be completed in the second half of 2001 and to relocate some of its employees from its off-campus medicinal chemistry building to the new
building. At March 31, 2001, Axys has incurred expenses of approximately $2.9 million on the construction and has commitments totaling approximately $5.0 million. In
June 2001, Axys secured a building construction loan for $11.0 million at an interest rate of prime plus one percent with a final maturity date not to exceed 15 months in order to
finance the completion of construction of this building. 

    The
drug development process is expensive and will require that Axys raise money in the future until it begins to generate substantial product or royalty revenues, if ever. Axys
believes that existing cash, short-term investments, revenues from existing collaborations, potential proceeds from the liquidation of our long-term equity investments in
Discovery Partners and DNA Sciences, and potential additional licensing revenues will enable Axys to continue current and planned operations for 18 to 24 months. Axys continues to actively
pursue a variety of financing alternatives. There can be no assurances that Axys can liquidate its investments in a timely manner, or that the proceeds from these investments will be adequate to meet
its requirements to fund operations. Finally, the senior secured convertible notes are collateralized by approximately 6.7 million shares of the Discovery Partners stock Axys owns; accordingly,
at such time that the Discovery Partners shares are liquidated, a substantial portion of the proceeds may be used to retire the debt. 

    In
July 2000, Axys completed a sale of $10 million of its common stock, under a shelf registration relating to the offer and sale of up to $50 million of its
common stock. The shares of common stock 

were sold at a discounted weighted average price of $6.10 to Acqua Wellington North American Equities Fund, Ltd.. Under the agreement with Acqua Wellington, Axys may, after additional SEC
filings in accordance with federal securities laws, and at Axys' discretion, issue and sell to Acqua Wellington up to an additional $40 million of common stock, at a price per share based on
the daily volume weighted average price. In addition, Axys may also grant to Acqua Wellington a right to purchase additional shares up to an amount equal to the number of shares Axys elect to sell
during that period. 

    If
the merger is not completed, Axys expects that it will need to continue to raise money for a number of years until it achieves, if it ever achieves, substantial product or royalty
revenues. If the merger is not completed, Axys expects to seek additional funding through new collaborations, the extension of existing collaborations, through sale of its interests in Discovery
Partners and DNA Sciences, or through public or private equity or debt financings. Axys cannot be certain that additional funding will be available or that the terms will be acceptable. Existing
stockholders will experience dilution of their investment if the merger is not completed and Axys raises additional funds by issuing equity. If adequate funds are not available, Axys may delay, reduce
or eliminate any of its research or development programs. Furthermore, Axys may obtain funds through arrangements with collaborative partners or others that require Axys to give up rights to
technologies or products that it would otherwise seek to develop or commercialize itself. 

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk  

    Axys' exposure to market risk is principally limited to Axys' cash equivalents and investments that have maturities of less than one year and equity
investments in public and private companies. Axys maintains an investment portfolio of investment grade, liquid securities that limit the amount of credit exposure to any one issue, issuer or type of
instrument. The securities in Axys' investment portfolio are not leveraged, are classified as available-for-sale and are therefore subject to interest rate risk. Axys currently
does not hedge interest rate exposure. If market interest rates were to increase by 100 basis points, or 1%, from December 31, 2000 levels, the fair value of Axys' portfolio would decline by
approximately $50,000. The modeling technique used measures the change in fair values arising from an immediate hypothetical shift in market interest rates and assumes ending fair values include
principal plus accrued interest. 

Holders  

    As of June 30, 2001 there were approximately 517 stockholders of record of Axys' common stock. 

Dividends  

    Since inception, Axys has not paid dividends on Axys' common stock. Axys currently intends to retain all future earnings, if any, for use in Axys' business and
currently does not plan to pay any cash dividends in the foreseeable future. Any future determination to pay dividends will be at the discretion of the Axys board of directors.

  In 2000, compensation for non-employee members of the Axys board of directors was $15,000 per
year, plus reimbursement of expenses. In addition, Mr. Lerner achieved an additional $30,000 as compensation for consulting services he provided to Axys during 2000. Mr. Walker, who was
an employee of Axys during 2000, received no compensation for his services during 2000 as a director
of Axys. Mr. Hastings was appointed to the Axys board of directors in December 2000 and became an employee in January 2001. Mr. Hastings received no compensation for his
services on the Axys board of directors in 2000. Directors of Axys do not receive any additional compensation for their services on committees. 

    Stock Options.
  Under the Axys Non-Employee Directors' Stock Option Plan established in 1994,
non-employee directors of Axys receive annual automatic stock option grants. The terms of the Non-Employee Directors' Stock Option Plan provide that each
non-employee elected for the first time to the Axys board of directors will be granted an option to purchase 30,000 shares of common stock upon the date of his or her initial election or
appointment. On the date of each annual meeting, each non-employee member of the Axys board of directors who has served for at least three months, and is re-elected to the Axys
board of directors, is automatically granted a non-qualified stock option to purchase 5,000 shares of Axys common stock. No other options may be granted at any time under this plan. The
exercise price of the options that are granted is 100% of the fair market value of the common stock on the date of the option grant. Options granted under the plan generally vest at a rate of 25% per
year for four years. The term of the options is ten years. In the event of a change-in-control of Axys, such as a merger with or into another corporation or a consolidation,
the unvested options will accelerate and become fully-vested immediately prior to consummation of the change of control. At that time, the holders of these options may exercise the options to purchase
shares of Axys common stock, and the options will expire if not exercised prior to consummation of the change-in-control. Following their election at the 2000 annual meeting,
Dr. Arvin, Dr. Kennedy, Dr. Read, Mr. Mendelson, Mr. Kailian, and Mr. Lerner each received options to acquire 5,000 shares of common stock at an exercise
price of $4.063 per share. As of June 30, 2001, none of the options granted under the plan had been exercised. Following their election at the 2001 annual meeting, Dr. Arvin,
Dr. Read, Mr. Mendeson, Mr. Kailian and Mr. Lerner each received options to acquire 5,000 shares of common stock at an exercise price of $3.14. 

    Stock Grants.
  In December 2000, the Axys board of directors resolved to make grants of common stock to
Mr. Kailian, Mr. Lerner and Mr. Mendelson in the amounts of 2,500 shares, 1,500 shares and 2,500 shares, respectively. These stock grants were made for service on the Chief
Executive Officer Search Committee of the Axys board of directors by Mr. Kailian, Mr. Lerner and Mr. Mendelson following Mr. Walker's announcement of his intent to resign
as the Chief Executive Officer of Axys upon the appointment of his successor. Mr. Walker resigned from the positions of Chief Executive Officer of Axys on January 1, 2001 and Chairman of
the Board on May 14, 2001. 

Relationships And Transactions You Should Know About  

    In 1997, Axys advanced $750,000 in a note receivable to Mr. Walker. The note, when it was outstanding, bore interest at the rate of 6.02% per year until
1999 when the interest rate was reduced to 4.71% per year. The note was full recourse and secured by shares of Axys common stock owned by Mr. Walker. In December 2000, Axys amended its
employment agreement with Mr. Walker. Under the terms of the agreement, Mr. Walker will receive approximately one-half of his former salary and bonus, forgiveness of his note
receivable plus accrued interest at December 31, 2000, in exchange for three years of continued service and an agreement not to compete. The agreement is in effect through December 31,
2003. Axys charged compensation expense in 2000 for the forgiveness of the note receivable. 

    In August 2000, Axys advanced $300,000 in a note receivable to Dr. Venuti for housing assistance. The note earns interest at 6.37% per year and interest is due
annually. The note plus accrued interest is forgivable over five years, subject to Dr. Venuti's continued employment with Axys. 

    In
January 2000, Axys advanced $300,000 in a note receivable to Mr. Hastings. The note earns interest at 5.61% per annum. The note is due and payable on
January 2, 2004, is full-recourse and is secured by shares of common stock that Mr. Hastings acquires upon the exercise of any stock options. The entire note will be forgiven
by Axys if Mr. Hastings continues to provide his services to Axys through January 2, 2004. 

    For
a more detailed discussion of the employment agreements of Mr. Walker, Dr. Venuti and Mr. Hastings with Axys, see the section of this proxy
statement/prospectus entitled "The MergerInterests of Certain Persons in the Merger." 

INFORMATION ABOUT APPLERA AND ANGEL ACQUISITION    

Applera  

    Applera was incorporated in Delaware in 1998 and succeeded by recapitalization to the business of PE Corporation (NY) (formerly The Perkin-Elmer Corporation)
in May 1999. Applera conducts its business through two operating groups: the Celera Genomics group and Applied Biosystems group. Applera has two classes of common stock, Celera Genomics common
stock and Applied Biosystems common stock, that are intended to reflect the relative performance of these groups. For more information about the capital stock of Applera, see "Description of Applera
Capital Stock" and "Risk FactorsRisks Related to a Capital Structure with Two Separate Classes of Common Stock" in this proxy statement/prospectus. 

    The
Celera Genomics group is engaged principally in the generation, sale, and support of genomic information and enabling data management and analysis software. The Celera Genomics
group's customers use this information for commercial applications in the pharmaceutical and life sciences industries in the specific areas of target identification, drug discovery, and drug
development. The Celera Genomics group also provides gene discovery, genotyping, and related genomics services. The Celera Genomics group has recently expanded its business into the emerging fields of
functional genomics, in particular, proteomics and personalized health/medicine. The Celera Genomics group intends to leverage its industrialized approach to biology to develop platforms for enabling
diagnostic and therapeutic discoveries both for its own internal product development and for its customers, including its collaboration partners. 

    The
Applied Biosystems group is a world leader in the development, manufacture, sale, and service of instrument systems and associated consumable products for life science research
and related applications. Its products are used in various applications including the synthesis, amplification, purification, isolation, analysis, and sequencing of nucleic acids, proteins, and other
biological molecules. 

    Applera's
principal executive offices are located at 301 Merrit 7, Norwalk, Connecticut 06851-1070 and its telephone number is (203) 840-2000. 

Angel Acquisition  

    Angel Acquisition is a wholly owned subsidiary of Applera, which was incorporated in Delaware for the sole purpose of effecting the merger by merging with and
into Axys. It engages in no other business. Its principal executive offices are c/o Applera Corporation at 301 Merrit 7, Norwalk, Connecticut 06851-1070 and its telephone number is
(203) 840-2000. 

Management Following the Acquisition  

    Following the merger, Axys will continue its operations as a wholly owned subsidiary of Applera. At the effective time of the merger, the current officers of
Axys will remain the officers of Axys. See "Management of Axys" in this proxy statement/prospectus for information about the current officers of Axys. Following the merger, the board of directors of
Axys will consist of one or more officers of Applera. 

UNAUDITED PRO FORMA CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED AND
  COMBINED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS    

    The following unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated and combined financial statements are presented to illustrate the effects of the merger on the
historical financial position and operating results of Applera and Axys and the Celera Genomics group and Axys. Because Applera and the Celera
Genomics group have different fiscal years than Axys, and the combined company will adopt the fiscal year-end of Applera and the Celera Genomics group, pro forma operating results are
presented on a June 30 fiscal-year basis. 

    The
following unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated and combined balance sheets of Applera and the Celera Genomics group at March 31, 2001 give effect to the merger as if
it occurred as of that date. The pro forma condensed consolidated and combined statements of operations of Applera and the Celera Genomics group for the nine months ended March 31, 2001 and the
year ended June 30, 2000 give effect to the merger as if it occurred as of July 1, 1999. 

    The
pro forma condensed combined financial statements have been derived from, and should be read in conjunction with, the historical consolidated and combined financial statements,
including the notes thereto, of Applera, the Celera Genomics group, and Axys. For Applera and the Celera Genomics group, those financial statements are included in Applera's Quarterly Report on
Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2001, and the Applera (formerly PE Corporation) Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended June 30,
2000, which are incorporated in this proxy statement/prospectus by reference. For Axys, those financial statements are included in this proxy statement/prospectus beginning on page F-1. 

    The
pro forma condensed consolidated and combined financial statements are presented for informational purposes only and are not necessarily indicative of the financial position or
results of operations of Applera and the Celera Genomics group that would have occurred had the merger been consummated as of the dates indicated. In addition, the pro forma condensed consolidated and
combined financial statements are not necessarily indicative of the future financial condition or operating results of Applera and the Celera Genomics group. 

    For
accounting purposes, Applera will be deemed to be the surviving corporation in the merger and the cost of the acquisition as well as the net assets and operations of Axys will be
allocated to the Celera
Genomics group. The pro forma adjustments are based upon currently available information and upon assumptions that management believes are reasonable. Applera will account for the merger based upon
the estimated fair market values of the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the date of acquisition. The adjustments included in the unaudited pro forma
condensed consolidated and combined financial statements represent the preliminary determination of these adjustments based upon available information. Applera cannot assure you that the actual
adjustments will not differ from the pro forma adjustments reflected in the pro forma financial information. 

    The
merger is structured so that holders of Axys common stock will receive shares of Celera Genomics common stock as consideration in the merger, as described under the "The
MergerConsideration to be Received in the Merger" in this proxy statement/prospectus. Under the terms of the transaction, the number of shares of Celera Genomics common stock to be
received for each share of Axys common stock is determined by an exchange ratio, which is subject to a maximum and a minimum as described under "The MergerConsideration to be Received in
the Merger" in this proxy statement/prospectus. For the purposes of the condensed consolidated and combined pro forma financial statements, it has been assumed that each share of Axys common stock
would receive the equivalent of $4.65 in Celera Genomics common stock. It has also been assumed that the same exchange ratio would apply with respect to warrants and stock options exercisable for
shares of Axys common stock. The exchange ratio provided for in the merger agreement was determined through arm's length negotiations. 

    Using these assumptions, the consideration to be paid by Applera in connection with the merger is approximately $220.0 million, consisting of the following: 


The
issuance of shares of Celera Genomics common stock with a market value of approximately $186.3 million as consideration for the outstanding
shares of Axys common stock;


fair
value of employee stock options to purchase Axys common stock assumed by Applera of $16.5 million;


fair
value of warrants to purchase Axys common stock assumed by Applera of $6.5 million; and


estimated
direct transactions costs of Applera of $10.7 million. 

    The
merger will be accounted for by Applera and the Celera Genomics group as an acquisition of Axys under the purchase method of accounting for business combinations, and accordingly,
the purchase price will be allocated to the tangible and identifiable intangible assets of Axys acquired by Applera and liabilities of Axys assumed by Applera on the basis of their fair values on the
acquisition date. The Celera Genomics group is in the process of obtaining an independent valuation of Axys. The preliminary allocation of the purchase price could be subject to significant change
depending upon the outcome of that independent valuation. For pro forma purposes, the Celera Genomics group has assumed that the historical carrying amounts of such assets and liabilities approximated
their fair values. The remaining purchase price over the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed has preliminarily been allocated to workforce, other intangible assets, deferred tax
assets and goodwill. The workforce allocation is approximately $6.6 million; the other intangible assets allocation, including patents and technology, is approximately $33.0 million; and
the deferred tax asset allocation is approximately $49.9 million. The remaining portion of purchase price in excess of tangible and intangible assets, estimated at $58.9 million, has
been allocated to goodwill. These amounts will vary based upon the valuation of the securities issued at consummation and the final outcome of the independent valuation. Such independent valuation
will likely include an allocation of a portion of the purchase price to "in process research and development" which would be required to be expensed immediately upon acquisition. Goodwill and other
intangible assets will be amortized over their
expected period of benefit, which is initially estimated as five years for other intangible assets and goodwill, and two years for workforce. 

    The
exchange ratio assumed for the pro forma financial statements was 0.1220 shares of Celera Genomics common stock for each share of Axys common stock, which is the exchange ratio
that would have been applied had the merger occurred on July 9, 2001. Once the final exchange ratio under the merger agreement has been determined, the amounts assumed in the following pro
forma financial statements will change. For example, if the average closing price of Celera Genomics common stock is 20% lower than the price of Celera Genomics common stock assumed in the pro forma
financial statements, the equivalent per share price of Axys common stock would be $4.13 per share and the total purchase price would be $195.4 million. The final changes in the purchase price
and the allocation of the purchase price would also impact the calculated pro forma earnings per share, based on the differing amounts of goodwill and other specifically identifiable intangible asset
amortization. 

    No
pro forma adjustments are necessary to reflect the merger of Applera into a separate wholly owned subsidiary of Applera because Applera's net assets will be recorded at their
historical cost basis. 

Accounting Changes  

 Business Combinations and Goodwill  

    It is expected that the Financial Accounting Standards Board will issue two new statements resulting from its project on Business Combinations that would
require a change in accounting for goodwill effective July 1, 2001. If these statements are issued as expected, goodwill from acquisitions occurring after July 1, 2001 would not be
amortized, and for goodwill existing prior to June 30, 2000, 

Applera and the Celera Genomics group may choose to adopt the nonamortization provisions of the statement either July 1, 2001 or July 1, 2002. Goodwill for which the nonamortization
provisions are being applied will be required to be reviewed for impairment on an annual basis. If an impairment is found to exist, a charge will be taken against operations. We cannot currently
determine the amount of an impairment charge, if any, that would be recorded upon adoption. 

    Accounting for Employee Stock Options.
  In March 2000, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued FASB
Interpretation No. 44, Accounting for Certain Transactions involving Stock Compensation, which contains rules designed to clarify the application of APB Opinion No. 25, Accounting for
Stock Issued to Employees. FASB Interpretation No. 44 has been effective since July 1, 2000. 

    Among
other matters, the provisions of FASB Interpretation No. 44 changed the accounting for an exchange of unvested employee stock options in a purchase business combination.
The new rules require the intrinsic value of the unvested awards to be allocated to unearned compensation and recognized as noncash compensation cost over the remaining future vesting period. The
ultimate amount to be allocated to unearned compensation will be based on the stock price of Celera Genomics common stock and the number of Axys' unvested employee stock options and restricted stock
awards
on the date the merger is completed. Based on the market price of Celera Genomics common stock and the number of Axys' unvested employee stock options, it is estimated that these new provisions would
have an immaterial net effect on pro forma net income of Applera and pro forma net loss of the Celera Genomics group for the nine months ended March 31, 2001 and the year ended June 30,
2000.

Notes to Unaudited Pro Forma Financial Statements  

    1.  Reflects
the proposed acquisition by Applera and the Celera Genomics group of Axys as follows: 

a)
the
issuance of approximately 4.9 million shares of Celera Genomics common stock with a market value of approximately $186.3 million for all outstanding shares of
capital stock of Axys at an average closing price during the calculation period equivalent to $4.65 per share of Axys common stock; 
b)
the
value of employee stock options of $16.5 million on an as-if converted basis determined using the Black Scholes option pricing model based on currently
available information; 
c)
the
value of warrants to purchase Axys common shares of $6.5 million determined using the Black Scholes option pricing model; 
d)
the
estimated transaction costs of $10.7 million recorded as a component of other accrued expenses in the pro forma condensed consolidated and combined balance sheets; 
e)
the
elimination of historical net assets assumed of $71.6 million; 
f)
Applera
and the Celera Genomics group is making a preliminary allocation of excess purchase price over estimated net assets assumed to goodwill and other intangible assets as the
carrying value of Axys' tangible assets and liabilities are estimated to approximate fair value; and 
g)
the
allocation of $148.4 million, which is the excess purchase price over the estimated net assets assumed as a deferred tax asset of $49.9 million, goodwill of
$58.9 million, workforce of $6.6 million and other intangible assets of $33.0 million as components of other long-term assets in the pro forma condensed consolidated
and combined balance sheets. 

    2.  To
make the following reclassifications to conform Axys' classification to that of Applera and the Celera Genomics group: Axys' non-cash compensation of
$1.0 million allocated to research and development expenses ($.3 million) and general and administrative expenses ($.7 million) in the pro forma consolidated and combined
statements of operations for the nine months ended March 31, 2001 and the year ended June 30, 2000; Axys' investment in equitymethod investee of $42.8 million and
other investments of $15.0 million to other long-term assets in the pro forma condensed consolidated and combined balance sheets and Axys' deferred revenues of $.4 million to
other accrued expenses in the pro forma condensed consolidated balance sheet. 

    3.  To
reflect amortization expense of goodwill and intangible assets in the pro forma statements of operations for the nine months ended March 31, 2001 and for
the year ended June 30, 2000 resulting from the allocation of the excess purchase price over the estimated net assets assumed. The total values assigned to goodwill and intangible assets in
millions and the related estimated useful lives in years are as follows: 

Description

Useful Life

Amount

Goodwill

$

58.9

Workforce

$

6.6

Other intangible assets

$

33.0

    The
pro forma statement of operations for the year ended June 30, 2000 also includes a reclassification of amortization of goodwill and intangibles of $4.2 million from
research and development expenses for Applera and the Celera Genomics Group. 

    4.  To
record income tax benefits provided on Axys' losses inclusive of amortization of certain specific identifiable intangible assets at a 35% rate. Goodwill
amortization is excluded from the losses as it is not deductible for tax purposes. Reference should be made to the risk factors related to the Celera Genomics group's tax benefits on page 35 of this
proxy statement/prospectus, as well as to 

Note 1, "Accounting Policies and PracticesAllocation of Federal and State Income Taxes," in the Notes to Combined Financial Statements of the Celera Genomics group in the Applera
(formerly PE Corporation) Annual Report for the year ended June 30, 2000 (which is incorporated by reference) for a description of Applera's tax policies. 

DESCRIPTION OF APPLERA CAPITAL STOCK    

    The following is a description of the terms of the capital stock of Applera. This description does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety
by reference to Applera's certificate of incorporation that has been incorporated by reference as an exhibit to the registration statement of which this proxy statement/prospectus is a part. 

General  

    Applera's certificate of incorporation authorizes it to issue 1,235,000,000 shares of stock as follows: 1,000,000,000 shares of a class of common stock,
designated as Applera Corporation-Applied Biosystems Group Common Stock, 225,000,000 shares of a class of common stock, designated as Applera Corporation-Celera Genomics Group Common Stock, and
10,000,000 shares of preferred stock. Shares of each class of stock have a par value of $.01 per share. Applera is able to issue shares of preferred stock in series, without stockholder approval. Of
the 10,000,000 authorized shares of preferred stock, Applera's board of directors has designated a total of 80,000 shares of two series of participating junior preferred stock for use in connection
with Applera's stockholder rights plan. See "Rights Agreement." 

    As
of June 28, 2001, there were no shares of preferred stock, 61,609,868 shares of Celera Genomics common stock and 211,293,240 shares of Applied Biosystems common stock issued
and outstanding. 

Celera Genomics Common Stock  

 Dividends  

    Dividends on Celera Genomics common stock will be limited to an amount not greater than the "Available Dividend Amount" for the Celera Genomics group. The
Available Dividend Amount for the Celera Genomics group is intended to be similar to the amount that would be legally available for the payment of dividends on Celera Genomics common stock if the
group were a separate company. In calculating the Available Dividend Amount for the Celera Genomics group, the amount of net income or loss of Applera that is attributed to the Celera Genomics group
in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles will be reduced by any unused federal tax benefits in excess of $75 million generated by the Celera Genomics group since
July 1, 1998. 

    Delaware
law limits the amount of distributions on Applera's capital stock to its legally available funds, which are determined on the basis of the entire company, and not only the
respective groups. As a result, the amount of legally available funds will reflect the amount of any net losses of each group, any distributions on Celera Genomics common stock, Applied Biosystems
common stock or any preferred stock, and any repurchases of Celera Genomics common stock, Applied Biosystems common stock or certain preferred stock. Dividend payments on Celera Genomics common stock
could be precluded because legally available funds of Applera are not available under Delaware law, even though the Available Dividend Amount test for the Celera Genomics group was met. Applera cannot
assure you that there will be an Available Dividend Amount for the Celera Genomics group or, if met, that Applera will have available funds to pay such a dividend. 

    Subject
to the prior payment of dividends on any outstanding shares of preferred stock and the limitations described above, Applera's board of directors is able, in its sole
discretion, to declare and pay dividends exclusively on Applied Biosystems common stock, exclusively on Celera Genomics 

common stock or on both, in equal or unequal amounts. In making its dividend decisions, Applera's board of directors is not required to take into account the relative available dividend amounts for
the two groups, the amount of prior dividends declared on either class, the respective voting or liquidation rights of either class or any other factor. 

 Conversion and Redemption  

    Mandatory Dividend, Redemption or Conversion of Common Stock if Disposition of Celera Genomics Group Assets Occurs.
  If
Applera sells, transfers, assigns or otherwise disposes of, in one transaction or a series of related transactions, all or substantially all of the properties and assets attributed to the Celera
Genomics group (a "disposition"), Applera is required, except as described below, to: 


pay
a dividend in cash and/or securities or other property to the holders of shares of Celera Genomics common stock having a fair value equal to the net
proceeds of the disposition; 

if
the disposition involves all, but not merely substantially all, of such properties and assets, redeem all outstanding shares of Celera Genomics common
stock in exchange for cash and/or securities or other property having a fair value equal to the net proceeds of the disposition; 

if
the disposition involves substantially all, but not all, of such properties and assets, redeem that number of whole shares of Celera Genomics common
stock as have in the aggregate an average market value, during the period of ten consecutive trading days beginning on the 26th trading day immediately succeeding the consummation date, closest to the
net proceeds of the disposition; and the redemption price will be cash and/or securities or other property having a fair value equal to such net proceeds; or 

convert
each outstanding share of Celera Genomics common stock into a number of shares of Applied Biosystems common stock equal to 110% of the ratio of the
average market value of one share of Celera Genomics common stock to the average market value of one share of Applied Biosystems common stock during the 10-trading day period beginning on
the 26th trading day following the disposition date. 

    Applera
may only pay a dividend or redeem shares of Celera Genomics common stock as set forth above if it has legally available funds under Delaware law and the amount to be paid to
holders is less than or equal to the Available Dividend Amount for the Celera Genomics group. Applera is required to pay such dividend or complete such redemption or conversion on or prior to the 95th
trading day following the disposition. 

    For
purposes of determining whether a disposition has occurred, "substantially all of the properties and assets" attributed to the Celera Genomics group means a portion of such
properties and assets: 


that
represents at least 80% of the then fair value of the properties and assets attributed to the Celera Genomics group; or 

from
which were derived at least 80% of the aggregate revenues of the Celera Genomics group for the immediately preceding twelve fiscal quarterly periods. 

    The
"net proceeds" of a disposition means an amount equal to what remains of the gross proceeds of the disposition after any payment of, or reasonable provision is made as determined
by Applera's board of directors for: 


any
taxes payable by Applera, or which would have been payable but for the utilization of tax benefits attributable to the Applied Biosystems group, in
respect of the disposition or in respect of any resulting dividend or redemption; 


any
transaction costs, including, without limitation, any legal, investment banking and accounting fees and expenses; and 

any
liabilities of or attributed to the Celera Genomics group, including, without limitation, any liabilities for deferred taxes, any indemnity or
guarantee obligations incurred in connection with the disposition or otherwise, any liabilities for future purchase price adjustments and any preferential amounts plus any accumulated and unpaid
dividends in respect of the preferred stock attributed to the Celera Genomics group. 

    Applera
may elect to pay the dividend or redemption price in connection with a disposition either in the same form as the proceeds of the disposition were received or in any other
combination of cash, securities or other property that Applera's board of directors or, in the case of securities that have not been publicly traded for a period of at least 15 months, an
independent investment banking firm, determines will have an aggregate market value of not less than the fair value of the net proceeds. 

The following illustration demonstrates the provisions requiring a mandatory dividend, redemption or conversion if a disposition
occurs
. If: 


50 million
shares of Celera Genomics common stock and 200 million shares of Applied Biosystems common stock were outstanding, 

the
net proceeds of the disposition of substantially all, but not all, of the assets of the Celera Genomics group equals $500 million, and 

the
average market values of Celera Genomics common stock and Applied Biosystems common stock during the 10-trading day valuation period were
$50 and $40 per share, respectively, then Applera could do any of the following: 
(1)
pay
a dividend to the holders of shares of Celera Genomics common stock equal to:

net proceeds

=

number of outstanding shares

of Celera Genomics common stock

$500 million

=

$10 per share

50 million shares

(2)
redeem
for $50 per share a number of shares of Celera Genomics common stock equal to:

net proceeds

=

average market value

of Celera Genomics common stock

$500 million

=

10,000,000 shares

$50 per share

(3)
convert
each outstanding share of Celera Genomics common stock into a number of shares of Applied Biosystems common stock equal
to:

average market value of Celera

Genomics common stock

1.1x

=

average market value

of Applied Biosystems common stock

$50 per share

1.1x

=

1.3750 shares

$40 per share

    Exceptions to the Dividend, Redemption or Conversion Requirement if a Disposition Occurs.
  Applera is not required to
take any of the above actions for any disposition of all or substantially all of the properties and assets attributed to the Celera Genomics group in a transaction or series of related transactions
that results in Applera's receiving for such proper
