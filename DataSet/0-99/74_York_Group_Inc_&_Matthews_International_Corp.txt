                                 PROXY STATEMENT
                 MERGER PROPOSED -- YOUR VOTE IS VERY IMPORTANT

Dear Stockholders:

         On behalf of the board of directors of The York Group, Inc. ("York"), I
invite you to attend a special meeting of stockholders to be held on Thursday,
August 9, 2001, at 9:00 a.m., local time, at the West Memorial Business Park
Conference Center, 8584 Katy Freeway, 1st Floor, Houston, Texas 77024. At the
special meeting, the York board of directors will ask you to consider and vote
upon a proposal to adopt a merger agreement dated as of May 24, 2001 providing
for the merger of Empire Merger Corp., a wholly-owned subsidiary of Matthews
International Corporation ("Matthews") into York. Following the merger, York
will continue as a subsidiary of Matthews. If the merger agreement is adopted by
the stockholders of York, each share of common stock of York, except shares held
by stockholders who exercise their appraisal rights under Delaware law, will be
converted into the right to receive between $10.00 and $11.00 per share in cash,
without interest. The actual price per share will be determined by a formula
that is described in the attached Proxy Statement.

         YOUR VOTE IS VERY IMPORTANT. Whether or not you plan to attend, please
complete and mail the enclosed proxy card to us in the enclosed return addressed
postage-paid envelope. If your shares are held of record in "street name" by a
broker, bank or other nominee ("broker nominee"), follow the voting instructions
that you receive from your broker nominee.

         IF YOU DO NOT RETURN YOUR PROXY CARD OR INSTRUCT YOUR BROKER NOMINEE
HOW TO VOTE YOUR SHARES HELD OF RECORD IN THE BROKER NOMINEE'S NAME, YOU WILL IN
EFFECT BE VOTING AGAINST ADOPTION OF THE MERGER AGREEMENT.

         This Proxy Statement gives you detailed information about the merger
and includes the merger agreement attached as Annex A. You should read all of
this information carefully. You can obtain more information about York and
Matthews from publicly available documents that they have filed with the
Securities and Exchange Commission.

         I ENTHUSIASTICALLY SUPPORT THIS MERGER AND JOIN WITH THE OTHER
DIRECTORS OF YORK IN RECOMMENDING THAT YOU VOTE "FOR" THE ADOPTION OF THE MERGER
AGREEMENT.

                                             Very truly yours,

                                             Thomas J. Crawford
                                             Chairman of the Board of Directors

         NEITHER THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION NOR ANY STATE SECURITIES
COMMISSION HAS (1) APPROVED OR DISAPPROVED THE MERGER, (2) PASSED UPON THE
MERITS OR FAIRNESS OF THE MERGER, OR (3) PASSED UPON THE ADEQUACY OR ACCURACY OF
THE DISCLOSURE IN THIS PROXY STATEMENT. ANY REPRESENTATION TO THE CONTRARY IS A
CRIMINAL OFFENSE.

         This document is dated July 9, 2001 and is first being distributed to
the stockholders of York on or about July 9, 2001.

                              THE YORK GROUP, INC.
                          8554 KATY FREEWAY, SUITE 200

                    NOTICE OF SPECIAL MEETING OF STOCKHOLDERS

To our Stockholders:

         Notice is hereby given that a special meeting of the stockholders of
The York Group, Inc., a Delaware corporation ("York"), will be held at the West
Memorial Business Park Conference Center, 8584 Katy Freeway, 1st Floor, Houston,
Texas 77024, at 9:00 a.m., local time, on Thursday, August 9, 2001, for the
following purposes, which are more fully described in the attached Proxy
Statement:

         1.   To adopt an Agreement and Plan of Merger dated as of May 24, 2001
              by and among Matthews International Corporation, a Pennsylvania
              corporation ("Matthews"), Empire Merger Corp., a Delaware
              corporation and a wholly-owned subsidiary of Matthews ("Empire"),
              and York, pursuant to which Empire will merge with and into York,
              with York, the surviving corporation, continuing as a subsidiary
              of Matthews.

         2.   To transact such other business as may properly come before the
              special meeting or any adjournment thereof.

         Only stockholders of record at the close of business on June 20, 2001,
are entitled to receive notice of and to vote at the special meeting or any
adjournment thereof.

         YOUR VOTE IS VERY IMPORTANT. THE PROPOSED MERGER CANNOT OCCUR UNLESS
THE MERGER AGREEMENT IS ADOPTED BY THE AFFIRMATIVE VOTE OF THE HOLDERS OF A
MAJORITY OF THE OUTSTANDING SHARES OF COMMON STOCK OF YORK. FAILURE TO VOTE WILL
HAVE THE SAME EFFECT AS A VOTE AGAINST ADOPTION OF THE MERGER AGREEMENT. WHETHER
OR NOT YOU PLAN TO ATTEND THE SPECIAL MEETING, PLEASE SIGN, DATE, AND RETURN THE
ACCOMPANYING PROXY CARD PROMPTLY. FOR YOUR CONVENIENCE, A RETURN ADDRESSED,
POSTAGE-PAID ENVELOPE IS ENCLOSED. YOU CAN FIND INSTRUCTIONS FOR VOTING ON THE
ENCLOSED PROXY CARD. IF YOUR SHARES ARE HELD IN "STREET NAME" BY A BROKER OR
OTHER NOMINEE, YOU MAY BE ABLE TO VOTE BY TELEPHONE OR THROUGH THE INTERNET IN
ACCORDANCE WITH THE INSTRUCTIONS YOU SHOULD RECEIVE FROM YOUR BROKER OR OTHER
NOMINEE.

         If you do not vote in favor of adopting the merger agreement and
otherwise comply with the requirements of the Delaware General Corporation Law
concerning appraisal rights, you will be entitled to appraisal rights. The
accompanying Proxy Statement summarizes these requirements under the heading
"The Merger -- Appraisal Rights under Delaware Law."

         YORK'S BOARD OF DIRECTORS UNANIMOUSLY RECOMMENDS THAT YOU VOTE "FOR"
ADOPTION OF THE MERGER AGREEMENT.

                                           By Order of the Board of Directors

                                           Cristen L. Cline

                     QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS ABOUT THE MERGER

Q:       WHAT AM I BEING ASKED TO VOTE ON AT THE SPECIAL MEETING?

A:       The York board of directors is asking you to vote to adopt a merger
         agreement that provides for the merger of Empire, a recently formed,
         wholly-owned subsidiary of Matthews, into York, with York surviving the
         merger and continuing as a subsidiary of Matthews. If the merger
         agreement is adopted, at the effective time of the merger York will no
         longer be a publicly held company.

Q.       WHAT WILL I RECEIVE IF THE MERGER IS COMPLETED?

A:       York stockholders will receive between $10.00 and $11.00 in cash,
         without interest, for each share of York common stock owned. The actual
         merger consideration will be based on a formula that is described in
         this Proxy Statement under "The Merger -- Effects of the Merger; Merger
         Consideration." The formula will be calculated after October 31, 2001,
         and the actual merger consideration will be determined and then
         announced publicly. No further stockholder action will be taken after
         the formula is calculated and the actual merger consideration is
         determined.

Q:       WHY IS YORK PROPOSING THE MERGER?

A:       York believes the merger presents the best opportunity to maximize
         stockholder value. The merger will enable York's stockholders to
         realize a premium over recent market prices for shares of York common
         stock. Based upon a cash merger consideration of $10.00 per share, the
         consideration to York stockholders represents a premium of 28.5%,
         73.6%, 77.8%, 150.0% and 185.0% over the average York closing prices
         for the 10-day period, 30-day period, 60-day period, 90-day period and
         180-day period, respectively, preceding May 24, 2001. In addition, the
         York board of directors evaluated other alternatives and concluded that
         none of these alternatives would likely result in stockholders
         receiving greater value for their York shares.

Q:       WHEN DO YOU EXPECT THE MERGER TO BE COMPLETED?

A:       It is anticipated that the merger will be completed no sooner than
         November 27, 2001 and no later than December 31, 2001. This period may
         be extended by York until five (5) days after the earlier of the
         expiration or termination of any applicable waiting period under the
         Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended (the
         "HSR Act").

Q:       WHO CAN VOTE AT THE SPECIAL MEETING?

A:       Holders of common stock of York at the close of business on June 20,
         2001, may vote at the Special Meeting.

Q:       IF MY SHARES ARE HELD IN "STREET NAME" BY MY BROKER, WILL MY BROKER
         VOTE MY SHARES FOR ME?

A:       Your broker will vote your shares only if you provide instructions on
         how to vote. Your broker will contact you regarding the procedures
         necessary to vote your shares. Please follow these procedures carefully
         and instruct your broker as to how you would like your shares voted at
         the Special Meeting. If you do not instruct your broker how to vote,
         your broker will not be able to vote your shares. Your broker's failure
         to vote your shares will have the same effect as a vote against
         adoption of the merger agreement.

Q:       WHAT VOTE IS REQUIRED TO ADOPT THE MERGER AGREEMENT?

A:       The merger agreement must be adopted by the holders of a majority of
         the outstanding shares of common stock of York.

Q:       IF I FAIL TO VOTE, WILL MY FAILURE TO VOTE HAVE ANY EFFECT ON THE
         OUTCOME?

A:       Yes. If you do not vote (i.e., if you do not send in a proxy card,
         instruct your broker on how to vote your shares, or vote in person at
         the Special Meeting), or if you abstain from voting, this action will
         have the same effect as a vote against adoption of the merger
         agreement.

Q:       WILL MATTHEWS BE CONSIDERED AN "ACQUIRING PERSON" UNDER THE SHAREHOLDER
         RIGHTS AGREEMENT DATED SEPTEMBER 28, 2000 BETWEEN YORK AND
         COMPUTERSHARE INVESTOR SERVICES, LLC (THE "YORK RIGHTS AGREEMENT")?

A:       No. York has taken and will continue to take all necessary action to
         ensure that none of the transactions contemplated in the merger
         agreement will cause Matthews, Empire or any of Matthews' affiliates or
         associates to become an Acquiring Person under the York Rights
         Agreement or otherwise affect in any way the rights under the York
         Rights Agreement, including causing the rights described in the York
         Rights Agreement to separate from the underlying shares or by giving
         such holders the rights to acquire securities of York. All York
         preferred stock purchase rights remain outstanding and when this
         document refers to York common stock, that term includes any associated
         York preferred stock purchase rights described in the York Rights
         Agreement.

Q:       WHAT WILL HAPPEN TO THE MEMBERS OF YORK'S MANAGEMENT?

A:       It is anticipated that all of the present members of York's executive
         management team will continue as officers and employees of York in
         their present capacities.

Q:       HAVE ANY PARTIES INVOLVED IN THE MERGER MADE A DETERMINATION AS TO THE
         FAIRNESS OF THE TRANSACTION TO STOCKHOLDERS?

A.       Yes. The York board of directors has reviewed various factors
         pertaining to the transaction and, based on its review, believes that
         the merger is fair to stockholders of York. In addition, York's
         financial advisor considered York's alternatives and the fairness of
         the transaction and determined that the merger consideration was fair
         to York stockholders from a financial point of view.

Q:       WHAT DO I NEED TO DO NOW?

A:       If you are a record owner of common stock of York, you need only
         complete, sign and mail your proxy card in the enclosed return
         addressed, postage-paid envelope as soon as possible so that your
         shares may be represented at the Special Meeting. If your shares are
         held in street name, you need only complete the instructions that your
         broker will send to you.

Q:       WHAT DO I DO IF I WANT TO CHANGE MY VOTE AFTER I MAIL MY PROXY CARD?

A:       You may change your vote by revoking your proxy at any time before the
         shares represented by your proxy are voted at the Special Meeting. You
         may do so in one of three ways:

         o        by completing and delivering a new, subsequently dated proxy
                  card to York;

         o        by sending York (to the attention of Cristen L. Cline,
                  Corporate Secretary) a written notice stating that you would
                  like to revoke your proxy; or

         o        by attending the Special Meeting and asking to vote in person
                  (your presence at the Special Meeting will not by itself
                  revoke your proxy).

Q:       WILL STOCKHOLDERS HAVE APPRAISAL RIGHTS?

A:       Yes. Under Delaware law, stockholders of York may be entitled to
         appraisal rights. If a stockholder does not vote in favor of the merger
         and meets all of the other requirements under Delaware law regarding
         appraisal rights (these requirements are summarized in this Proxy
         Statement under "The Merger -- Appraisal Rights under Delaware Law" and
         a copy of the relevant statutory provisions is set forth in Annex C),
         he or she will receive the "fair value" of his or her York common stock
         as determined by a court. The court may determine that the fair value
         is greater than, equal to, or less than the amount stockholders will
         receive if the merger is completed.

                                     -2-

Q:       HOW WILL I GET PAID FOR MY COMMON STOCK OF YORK?

A:       If the merger agreement is approved and adopted by stockholders and the
         merger is completed, you will receive instructions in the mail
         explaining how to exchange your stock certificates for cash.

Q:       SHOULD I SEND IN MY STOCK CERTIFICATES NOW?

A:       No. After the merger is completed, you will receive written
         instructions explaining how to exchange your stock certificates for
         cash.

Q:       WHAT ARE THE FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSEQUENCES OF THE MERGER TO YORK
         STOCKHOLDERS?

A:       If the merger is completed, the payment of cash for shares of stock
         will be taxable to York stockholders. Stockholders will recognize a
         gain or loss in an amount equal to the difference between the adjusted
         tax basis of their shares and the amount of cash they receive in the
         merger. All stockholders should consult their tax advisor for a full
         understanding of the tax consequences of the merger.

                            SUMMARY TERM SHEET

         This summary term sheet highlights selected information from this Proxy
Statement and does not contain all of the information that is important to you.
To understand the proposal fully and for a more complete description of the
terms of the merger, you should read this entire document carefully, including
the documents to which you have been referred and the Annexes. We have included
page references to the Proxy Statement parenthetically to direct you to a more
complete description of each topic presented in this summary. The merger
agreement is attached as Annex A to this Proxy Statement. We encourage you to
read the entire agreement carefully because it is the legal document that
governs the transaction. In addition, you may obtain information about Matthews
and York from documents that Matthews and York have filed with the Securities
and Exchange Commission.

o        THE COMPANIES (PAGE 36)

         York, a Delaware corporation, is one of the leading casket and
casket component manufacturers in the United States. Since December 31, 2000,
York has sold its metal vault manufacturing operations, its commemorative
products business and most of its casket distribution operations.

         Matthews, a Pennsylvania corporation, is a designer, manufacturer and
marketer of custom-made products which are used to identify people, places,
products and events. Matthews' products and operations are comprised of three
business segments: Bronze, Graphics Imaging and Marking Products.

         Empire is a Delaware corporation organized solely for the purpose of
effecting Matthews's acquisition of York through the merger. It is a
wholly-owned subsidiary of Matthews.

o        THE SPECIAL MEETING (PAGE 10)

         The Special Meeting will be held at West Memorial Business Park
Conference Center, 8584 Katy Freeway, 1st Floor, Houston, Texas 77024, at 9:00
a.m., local time, on Thursday, August 9, 2001. At the Special Meeting,
stockholders will be asked to consider and vote upon a proposal to adopt the
merger agreement.

o        REASONS FOR THE MERGER (PAGE 16)

         The merger presents the best opportunity to maximize York's stockholder
value. The merger will enable York stockholders to realize a premium over recent
market prices for shares of York common stock. In addition, the York board of
directors evaluated other alternatives to the merger and concluded that none of
these alternatives would likely result in stockholders receiving greater value
for their York shares.

o        RECOMMENDATION OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS (PAGE 16)

         The York board of directors believes the merger is in the best interest
of stockholders and believes the merger is fair to stockholders of York. The
York board of directors has unanimously approved the merger agreement and
unanimously recommends that stockholders vote "FOR" adoption of the merger
agreement.

o        EFFECTS OF THE MERGER; MERGER CONSIDERATION (PAGE 18)

         Upon consummation of the merger:

         o        Empire will be merged into York, with York, the surviving
                  corporation, continuing as a subsidiary of Matthews.

         o        each share of York common stock issued and outstanding at the
                  effective time of the merger, except shares held by
                  stockholders who properly exercise their appraisal rights
                  under Delaware law and shares held by Matthews or any
                  wholly-owned subsidiary or affiliate of Matthews (which shares
                  will be cancelled), will be converted into the right to
                  receive between $10.00 and $11.00 in cash, without interest.
                  The actual merger consideration will be determined by a
                  formula described in this Proxy Statement under "The
                  Merger--Effects of the Merger; Merger Consideration." The
                  formula will be applied after October 31, 2001, and the
                  actual merger consideration will be

                                    -4-

                  determined by the parties and then announced publicly. No
                  further stockholder action will be taken after the formula is
                  calculated and the actual merger consideration is determined.

         o        each share of common stock of Empire issued and outstanding at
                  the effective time of the merger will be converted into and
                  exchanged for one share of common stock of York.

o        OPINION OF YORK'S FINANCIAL ADVISOR (PAGE 19)

         York's financial advisor, Houlihan Lokey Howard & Zukin Financial
Advisors, Inc. ("Houlihan Lokey"), delivered its opinion as of May 23, 2001
(the date that the merger agreement was approved by the York board of
directors) that the per share consideration (between $10.00 and $11.00 per
share) is fair to York stockholders from a financial point of view. The full
text of Houlihan Lokey's written opinion, which sets forth assumptions made,
matters considered and limitations on the review undertaken in connection
with the opinion, is attached as Annex B to this Proxy Statement. You should
read this opinion in its entirety. The York board of directors does not plan
to obtain an update to this opinion.

o        RECORD DATE AND VOTING (PAGE 10)

         Holders of York shares are entitled to receive notice and to vote at
the Special Meeting if they owned the shares as of the close of business on the
record date of June 20, 2001. On the record date, 8,940,950 shares of common
stock were outstanding and entitled to vote at the Special Meeting. Stockholders
will have one vote for each share of common stock of York they owned on the
record date.

         The presence in person or by proxy of the holders of shares
representing a majority of the outstanding shares of York common stock is
necessary for a quorum to be present at the Special Meeting. Abstentions and
broker non-votes will be counted as shares present for the purpose of
determining the presence of a quorum at the Special Meeting.

o        STOCKHOLDER VOTE REQUIRED (PAGE 12)

         The affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the outstanding
shares of York common stock as of the record date is required to adopt the
merger agreement.

o        APPRAISAL RIGHTS (PAGE 25)

         Holders of York shares are entitled to appraisal rights under Delaware
law. If a stockholder properly exercises his or her appraisal rights, the
stockholder will be entitled to a judicial determination of the fair value of
his or her shares of York common stock. The stockholder will then receive from
the surviving corporation payment of the fair value in cash, together with a
fair rate of interest, if any, as determined by the court. The court may
determine that the fair value is greater than, equal to or less than the amount
stockholders will receive if the merger is completed. In that case, the
stockholder will not receive payment for his or her shares as described in this
Proxy Statement. In order to exercise appraisal rights, the stockholder must (1)
not vote in favor of the adoption of the merger agreement, (2) make a written
demand for appraisal to York prior to the taking of the vote on the adoption of
the merger agreement, (3) hold shares of York common stock on the date of making
the written demand for appraisal, and (4) otherwise comply fully with Section
262 of the Delaware General Corporation Law. If you wish to exercise your
appraisal rights, you must mail or deliver the written demand for appraisal to
The York Group, Inc. at 8554 Katy Freeway, Suite 200, Houston, Texas 77024,
Attention: Cristen L. Cline, Corporate Secretary.

o        INTERESTS OF CERTAIN PERSONS IN THE MERGER (PAGE 24)

         The executive officers and directors of York have interests that are
different from, or in addition to, the interests of the stockholders of York.

         York maintains change of control agreements with certain of its
executive officers. The agreements provide that in the event of a change of
control of York, if the executive is terminated without good cause (as defined
in the agreements) or he or she voluntarily terminates employment for good
reason (as defined in the agreements) within one year of the change of control,
he or she will be entitled to (1) a lump-sum payment equal to a multiple of his
or her base salary in the year immediately preceding the termination, and (2)
continuation of health

                                    -5-

care and life insurance benefits for one year following the termination. The
merger will constitute a change of control of York for purposes of the
agreements.

o        CONDITIONS TO THE MERGER (PAGE 32)

         The merger will be completed only if a number of conditions are either
met or (where permitted) waived by the parties, including the following:

         o        stockholders holding a majority of the outstanding common
                  stock of York have voted in favor of adopting the merger
                  agreement;

         o        the waiting period applicable to the completion of the merger
                  under the HSR Act has expired or been terminated and any other
                  regulatory approvals have been received; and

         o        no temporary restraining order, injunction, or other order or
                  restraint prohibits the merger.

         In addition, either York or Matthews has the right to withdraw from the
merger unless the following conditions are met or (where permitted) waived by
it:

         o        the other party's representations and warranties are true and
                  correct in all material respects as of the date of the merger
                  agreement and as of the closing date of the merger; and

         o        the other party has performed in all material respects each
                  obligation and agreement set forth in the merger agreement and
                  has complied in all material respects with each covenant
                  required to be performed or complied with by it under the
                  merger agreement.

o        REGULATORY MATTERS (PAGE 24)

         York and Matthews have each committed to use its reasonable best
efforts to take whatever actions are required to obtain necessary regulatory
approvals.

         The HSR Act prohibits York and Matthews from completing the merger
until they have furnished certain information and materials to the Antitrust
Division of the U.S. Department of Justice and the Federal Trade Commission and
all required waiting periods have expired.

         A notice is expected to be filed under the HSR Act with the Federal
Trade Commission and the Department of Justice in the first week of
September. In addition, York expects to make all other filings required under
other antitrust or competition laws or by other antitrust authorities. The
Department of Justice and the Federal Trade Commission have the authority to
challenge the merger on antitrust grounds before or after the merger is
completed. Each state and country where either York or Matthews has
operations may also review the merger under such jurisdiction's antitrust
laws.

o        TERMINATION OF THE MERGER AGREEMENT (PAGE 33)

         York and Matthews may mutually agree in writing to terminate the merger
agreement at any time before or after stockholder approval. In addition, either
York or Matthews may terminate the merger agreement if:

         o        the merger has not been consummated by December 31, 2001;
                  provided, however, this date may be extended by York until
                  five (5) days after the earlier of the expiration or
                  termination of any applicable waiting period under the HSR
                  Act;

         o        a court of competent jurisdiction or other governmental entity
                  has taken action to permanently restrain, enjoin or otherwise
                  prohibit the merger;

         o        the stockholders of York do not adopt the merger agreement at
                  the Special Meeting; or

         o        the York board of directors has determined to recommend a
                  proposal for a merger, consolidation, share exchange, business
                  combination or other similar transaction other than the
                  transactions contemplated by the merger agreement ("takeover
                  proposal") to its stockholders and to enter into a

                                    -6-

                  binding written agreement concerning such takeover proposal
                  after determining that such proposal is superior to the
                  merger.

         In addition, York may terminate the merger agreement if:

         o        a material breach of or failure to perform any representation,
                  warranty, covenant or agreement on the part of Matthews set
                  forth in the merger agreement has occurred which remains
                  uncured for a period of ten (10) business days after the
                  notice of such breach or failure; or

         o        York's earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and
                  amortization, which is commonly called "EBITDA," (subject to
                  certain adjustments set forth in the merger agreement) for the
                  nine months ended September 30, 2001 equals at least $9.0
                  million (the "Threshold EBITDA") and the York Equity Value (as
                  defined in the merger agreement) is greater than $11.00 per
                  share.

         In addition, Matthews may terminate the merger agreement if:

         o        the York board of directors has not recommended or has
                  withdrawn its recommendation of the merger agreement and the
                  merger (other than due to its recommendation of a superior
                  takeover proposal);

         o        a material breach of or failure to perform any representation,
                  warranty, covenant or agreement on the part of York set forth
                  in the merger agreement has occurred which remains uncured for
                  a period of ten (10) business days after the notice of such
                  breach or failure; or

         o        the Threshold EBITDA is not achieved.

o        EXPENSES AND TERMINATION FEE  (PAGE 33)

         York and Matthews will share equally all fees and expenses, other than
attorneys' and accounting fees and expenses, incurred in relation to the
printing and filing of this Proxy Statement. Those fees and expenses incurred in
connection with the merger, the merger agreement and the transactions
contemplated by the merger agreement will be paid by the party incurring those
fees or expenses whether or not the merger is completed.

         Matthews is required to pay a termination fee of $6 million to York if
the merger agreement is terminated by either Matthews or York under certain
circumstances. York is required to pay a termination fee of $6 million to
Matthews if the merger agreement is terminated by either York or Matthews under
certain circumstances. See "The Merger Agreement -- Termination, Termination
Fees, Amendment and Waiver."

o        FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSEQUENCES (PAGE 24)

         The receipt of cash by a stockholder of York pursuant to the merger
will be a taxable transaction for federal income tax purposes and may also be
taxable under applicable state, local and foreign income and other tax laws. A
stockholder will recognize a gain or loss in an amount equal to the difference
between the adjusted tax basis of his or her York common stock and the amount of
cash received in the merger. Such gain or loss will be a capital gain or loss if
the York common stock is a capital asset in the hands of the stockholder and
will be a long-term capital gain or loss if the holding period exceeds one year.
This tax treatment may not apply to every stockholder. Determining the actual
tax consequences may be complicated, and will depend on the specific situation
and variables not within York's control. All stockholders should consult their
own tax advisor for a full understanding of the tax consequences of the merger
to them. See "The Merger -- Federal Income Tax Consequences."

                           FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS

         The statements contained in this Proxy Statement and in the documents
that have been incorporated into this Proxy Statement by reference include
forward-looking statements about York. These forward-looking statements are
subject to risks and uncertainties and should be read with the cautionary
statements included in this document. Forward-looking statements include, by way
of example and without limitation, statements concerning plans, objectives,

other statements which are other than statements of historical facts, and
information concerning future results of the operations of York and the
surviving company after the effective time of the merger. Forward-looking
statements are set forth, among other places, under "Questions and Answers About
the Merger," "Summary Term Sheet," "Background of the Merger," "Purpose and
Reasons for the Merger," "Recommendation of the Board of Directors," and
"Opinion of York's Financial Advisor." Forward-looking statements may be
identified, preceded by, followed by or otherwise include, without limitation,
words such as "believes," "expects," "anticipates," "intends," "estimates" or
similar expressions. York's expectations, beliefs and projections are expressed
in good faith and are believed by York to have a reasonable basis including,
without limitation, management's examination of historical operating trends,
data contained in York's records and other data available from third parties.
There can be no assurance that management's expectations, beliefs or projections
will result or be achieved or accomplished.

         In addition to the factors discussed elsewhere in this Proxy
Statement, factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from
those discussed in the forward-looking statements are discussed in York's
filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. See "Where You Can Find
More Information."

                              YORK SPECIAL MEETING

PURPOSE OF THE YORK SPECIAL MEETING

         At the Special Meeting, stockholders of York will be asked to consider
and vote upon a proposal to adopt the merger agreement.

         THE YORK BOARD OF DIRECTORS HAS UNANIMOUSLY APPROVED THE MERGER
AGREEMENT AND RECOMMENDS THAT STOCKHOLDERS VOTE "FOR" ADOPTION OF THE MERGER
AGREEMENT. For additional information, see "The Merger -- Background of the
Merger," "-- Purpose and Reasons for the Merger" and "-- Recommendation of the
Board of Directors."

RECORD DATE AND VOTING

         The York board of directors has fixed the close of business on June 20,
2001 as the record date ("Record Date") for determining holders entitled to
notice of and to vote at the Special Meeting and any adjournment of the Special
Meeting.

         On the Record Date, 8,940,950 shares of common stock, held by
approximately 179 record owners, were outstanding and entitled to vote. Each
share of York common stock is entitled to one vote, exercisable in person or by
properly executed proxy.

         Only stockholders of record at the close of business on the Record Date
are entitled to notice of the Special Meeting and to vote at the Special
Meeting. If your shares are held in "street name," meaning that your shares are
held not in your name but in the name of a broker (or other nominee), you will
receive instructions from your broker explaining what you must do in order for
your broker to be able to vote your shares. Please follow these instructions
carefully to ensure that your shares will be voted at the Special Meeting. If
you do not provide instructions to your broker, your broker will not be able to
vote your shares (your broker's inability to vote is referred to as a "broker
non-vote").

PROXIES AND REVOCATION OF PROXIES

         Because many stockholders will not be able to attend the Special
Meeting, the York board of directors is soliciting proxies to give each
stockholder an opportunity to vote on the proposal to adopt the merger
agreement. The York board of directors urges you to:

         o        read the material in this Proxy Statement carefully;

         o        vote on the proposal to adopt the merger agreement by marking
                  the appropriate box on the accompanying proxy card or
                  completing the instructions sent to you by your broker (or
                  other nominee); and

         o        sign, date and return the proxy card in the enclosed
                  postage-paid envelope.

         The proxy card has separate boxes allowing you to vote for or against
adoption of the merger agreement, as well as abstaining from such vote. The
proxy card should be completed. All properly executed proxy cards received and
not properly and timely revoked will be voted in accordance with the
instructions. IF NO INSTRUCTIONS ARE INDICATED, SUCH SHARES WILL BE VOTED "FOR"
THE PROPOSAL TO ADOPT THE MERGER AGREEMENT. The York board of directors is not
aware of any other matters that may come before the Special Meeting. If any
other matters properly come before the Special Meeting, the persons named in the
accompanying proxy card intend to vote the proxy in accordance with their
judgment on such matters.

         You may revoke your proxy at any time before the shares represented by
the proxy are voted at the Special Meeting. You may do so in one of three ways:

         o        by completing and delivering a new, subsequently dated proxy
                  card to York;

         o        by sending York a written notice stating that you would like
                  to revoke your proxy (all such notices should be sent to The
                  York Group, Inc., 8554 Katy Freeway, Suite 200, Houston, Texas
                  77024, Attention: Cristen L. Cline, Corporate Secretary); or

                                   -10-

         o        by attending the Special Meeting and asking to vote in person
                  (your presence at the Special Meeting will not by itself
                  revoke your proxy).

         If a quorum is not present at the Special Meeting, or if it appears
that the merger agreement will not be adopted by stockholders at the Special
Meeting, then a majority of the shares of common stock present in person or by
proxy at the Special Meeting may adjourn the Special Meeting in order to give
the York board of directors time to solicit additional proxies or votes for the
adoption of the merger agreement. In such case, the proxy holders intend to vote
in favor of adjourning the Special Meeting. At any reconvening of the Special
Meeting, all proxies, except those that have been revoked or withdrawn, will be
voted in the same manner in which they would have been voted at the original
convening of the Special Meeting.

         Votes represented in person or by proxy at the Special Meeting will be
tabulated by the election inspectors appointed for the meeting and will
determine whether or not a quorum is present. The election inspectors will treat
abstentions and broker non-votes as shares that are present and entitled to vote
for purposes of determining the presence of a quorum but as unvoted for purposes
of determining approval of any matter submitted to the stockholders for a vote.
If a broker indicates on the proxy that it does not have discretionary authority
as to certain shares to vote on a particular matter, these shares will not be
considered as present and entitled to vote with regard to that matter.

QUORUM

         The presence in person or by proxy of holders representing a majority
of the issued and outstanding shares of York common stock is necessary to
constitute a quorum at the Special Meeting. Abstentions and broker non-votes
will be counted as shares present for the purpose of determining the presence of
a quorum at the Special Meeting.

SOLICITATION OF PROXIES

         York and Matthews will share equally all fees and expenses, other than
attorneys' and accounting fees and expenses, incurred in relation to the
printing and filing of this document (including any related preliminary
materials.) York will bear all other costs of soliciting proxies. In addition to
the use of the mails, proxies may be solicited by officers, directors, and
regular employees, personally or by telephone. York will reimburse banks,
brokers, and other nominees for any out-of-pocket expenses incurred by them in
sending proxy materials to the beneficial owners of York's common stock. If
follow-up requests for proxies are necessary, York may employ other persons to
make these requests.

APPRAISAL RIGHTS

         Stockholders who do not vote in favor of adoption of the merger
agreement and who otherwise comply with the requirements of the Delaware General
Corporation Law concerning appraisal rights will be entitled to appraisal
rights. Stockholders who vote in favor of adoption of the merger agreement will
have waived their appraisal rights. For more information, see "The Merger --
Appraisal Rights Under Delaware Law."

STOCK CERTIFICATES

         Please do not include your stock certificates with your proxy card. If
the merger agreement is adopted by stockholders and the merger is completed, you
will receive instructions explaining how to surrender your stock certificates.
Prior to the effective time of the merger, Matthews will deposit with a company
responsible for exchanging stock certificates for cash, called the "exchange
agent," an amount of cash equal to the aggregate merger consideration. The
exchange agent will act as paying agent for the benefit of the holders of
certificates of York common stock in exchange for the merger consideration. Each
holder of York common stock who surrenders his or her York shares to the
exchange agent will be entitled to receive a cash payment upon acceptance of the
shares by the exchange agent.

         As soon as practicable after the effective time of the merger, a letter
of transmittal will be mailed by the exchange agent to York stockholders. The
letter of transmittal will contain instructions for surrendering the
certificates of York common stock. York stockholders should not send stock
certificates to York or the exchange agent until the letter of transmittal is
received. If a certificate for York common stock has been lost, stolen or
destroyed, the person claiming the loss, theft or destruction of his or her
certificate, will have to execute an affidavit and may have to post a bond, if
required by Matthews and the exchange agent, prior to the payment of cash
representing the merger consideration.

                                   -11-

         Twelve months following the effective time of the merger, the exchange
agent will deliver to Matthews any funds, certificates, and other documents, not
claimed by former York stockholders. Thereafter, the payment obligation for any
certificate representing York common stock which has not been satisfied will
become the responsibility of Matthews. If certificates for York common stock are
not surrendered prior to the date on which such payments would otherwise escheat
to or become the property of any governmental agency, the unclaimed amounts will
become the property of Matthews to the extent permitted by applicable law, free
and clear of all claims or interest of any person previously entitled to such
property. None of Matthews, the exchange agent nor the surviving corporation
will be liable to any former holder of York common stock for any amount properly
delivered to a public official pursuant to applicable abandoned property,
escheat or similar laws.

REQUIRED VOTE

         The affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the shares of
common stock that are outstanding as of the close of business on June 20, 2001
(the Record Date) is required to adopt the merger agreement. BECAUSE A FIXED
NUMBER OF AFFIRMATIVE VOTES IS REQUIRED TO ADOPT THE MERGER AGREEMENT (EQUAL TO
A MAJORITY OF SHARES OF COMMON STOCK OUTSTANDING ON THE RECORD DATE), THE
FAILURE TO RETURN A PROXY CARD OR TO VOTE IN PERSON AT THE SPECIAL MEETING, AS
WELL AS ABSTENTIONS AND BROKER NON-VOTES, WILL HAVE THE SAME EFFECT AS VOTES
CAST AGAINST THE ADOPTION OF THE MERGER AGREEMENT.

         THE MATTERS TO BE CONSIDERED AT THE SPECIAL MEETING ARE OF GREAT
IMPORTANCE TO THE STOCKHOLDERS OF YORK. ACCORDINGLY, YORK STOCKHOLDERS ARE URGED
TO READ AND CAREFULLY CONSIDER THE INFORMATION PRESENTED IN THIS PROXY
STATEMENT, AND TO COMPLETE, DATE, SIGN AND PROMPTLY RETURN THE ENCLOSED PROXY IN
THE ENCLOSED RETURN ADDRESSED, POSTAGE-PAID ENVELOPE.

                                   -12-

                                   THE MERGER

BACKGROUND OF THE MERGER

         In September 1999 in Kansas City, executives of York and Wilbert, Inc.
met to discuss possible business opportunities and strategic alliances. Wilbert
is a privately-held Illinois corporation that has an established network of
independently owned licensees which are granted the right to manufacture and
sell Wilbert burial vaults and to whom Wilbert supplies burial vault forms,
liners and other related products. Wilbert also manufactures a variety of
vacuum-molded plastic products, adhesives, coatings and other similar products.
In October 1999, York representatives received from Curtis J. Zamec, president
and chief executive officer of Wilbert, financial and other information
regarding Wilbert.

         Discussions between Wilbert and York representatives continued through
October and November 1999 in Chicago and Kansas City concerning potential joint
business opportunities between the companies. These discussions included a
review of York's financial forecasts and other financial information. In January
2000, Wilbert representatives (board of directors members Mr. Zamec, Terry G.
Christenberry, and Joseph U. Suhor III) met with York representatives (board of
directors members Robert T. Rakich, Roger W. Sevedge, Kirk P. Pendleton, Alan H.
Elder, H. Joe Trulove and Bill W. Wilcock, then president and chief executive
officer) to discuss operational issues and a possible business combination.

         In February 2000, a mutual confidentiality agreement was executed
between York and Wilbert and non-public financial information was exchanged. On
March 24, 2000, representatives of York and Wilbert discussed the financial
information and the potential weighting of shares in any proposed business
combination. Mr. Christenberry then sent Mr. Rakich correspondence concerning
hypothetical weightings for a business combination. These weightings made it
clear that Wilbert and its stockholders required a larger interest than York and
its stockholders in any combined business. On March 27, 2000, Mr. Rakich
reported this information to the York board of directors and proposed to discuss
these matters in full at York's regularly scheduled board of directors meeting
on May 17, 2000. On May 28, 2000, York informed Wilbert that York wished to
postpone any further discussions due to York's ongoing efforts to refinance its
existing debt.

         In May 2000, York and its lenders entered into a waiver and forbearance
agreement, and York received certain financial covenant waivers pursuant to its
amended and restated credit agreement. York's total debt at the time was $72.0
million. York's management then undertook a comprehensive review of alternatives
to reduce and refinance its debt.

         From the end of May 2000 through June 2000, Mr. Zamec telephoned Mr.
Elder several times seeking a private meeting regarding Mr. Elder's support of a
business combination and a potential purchase of Mr. Elder's shares of York
common stock by Wilbert. On June 20, 2000, Mr. Elder met with Mr. Zamec in
Philadelphia, at which time Mr. Elder informed Mr. Zamec that he would not
discuss the matter further with Mr. Zamec.

         On September 18, 2000, Wilbert filed a Schedule 13D reporting ownership
of 9.9% of York's outstanding common stock. On September 20, 2000, Thomas J.
Crawford, York's new chief executive officer, spoke by telephone with Mr. Zamec
concerning Wilbert's acquisition of York shares. Mr. Crawford and Mr. Zamec
agreed to meet in person at the annual National Funeral Directors Association
convention in early October. On September 21, 2000, Wilbert amended its Schedule
13D reporting ownership of 11.3% of York's outstanding common stock.

         On September 27, 2000, the York board of directors approved and adopted
the York Rights Agreement pursuant to which rights to acquire York common stock
would be triggered when a person or entity acquired 15% or more of York's
outstanding common stock. On October 2, 2000, Wilbert formally requested that
the York board of directors reverse its action in adopting the York Rights
Agreement, approve Wilbert under Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation
Law and permit Wilbert to continue to make purchases of shares of York common
stock. Wilbert also amended its Schedule 13D reporting an increased ownership of
11.8% of York's outstanding common stock. Mr. Crawford informed Mr. Zamec by
telephone that York would not reverse its actions in adopting the York Rights
Agreement or approve Wilbert under Section 203 of the Delaware General
Corporation Law.

         In September 2000, York again entered into a waiver and forbearance
agreement with its lenders and received certain covenant waivers under its
amended and restated credit agreement through December 2000. York's total debt
at the time was $67.6 million. York management continued its focus on reducing
and refinancing its debt.

         On October 8, 2000, Mr. Zamec and Mr. Crawford met at the National
Funeral Directors Association convention. On October 24, 2000, Wilbert amended
its Schedule 13D reporting ownership of 13.2% of York's

                                   -13-

outstanding common stock. On November 10, 2000, Messrs. Zamec, Christenberry,
Crawford and Pendleton met in Philadelphia to discuss the general state of
the death care industry, recent industry trends and challenges, various
structures under which Wilbert's and York's stockholders might benefit from a
full or partial business combination and its potential benefits, the various
product lines, sales methods and distribution channels of each respective
company, and of Wilbert potentially making a loan to York. The
representatives agreed to discuss these matters with their respective
companies.

         On November 16, 2000, Mr. Crawford called Mr. Zamec requesting a
meeting between representatives of York and Wilbert. On November 21, 2000,
Messrs. Zamec, Christenberry, Suhor, Pendleton, Elder and Sevedge met in
Philadelphia. During that meeting, Wilbert's representatives expressed again
their interest in a combination between the two companies or a transaction in
which Wilbert would make a loan to York enabling York to refinance its debt.
York representatives requested the companies each designate representatives to
study a potential combination and to develop a joint plan of operation which
would then be followed by further discussions.

         Previously, on November 8, 2000, Wilbert requested York to produce or
make available its stock ledger and any related records or documents for
Wilbert's inspection. York denied that request for failure to state a proper
purpose as required by applicable law. Mr. Crawford, however, in a subsequent
telephone conversation with Mr. Zamec, invited Wilbert to send a second request
stating a proper purpose with his indication that York would honor Wilbert's
proper request. Wilbert sent a second letter, dated November 30, 2000,
requesting to inspect York's stock ledger with an amended purpose to solicit
proxies or consents to call a special meeting at which Wilbert would seek to
replace the York board of directors, or to solicit proxies to replace the York
board of directors at the next annual meeting.

         On December 1, 2000, Wilbert sent a letter to York proposing a business
combination between the two companies. Such proposal contained no financial
terms, but did include a proposal that the majority of the new company's board
of directors would be Wilbert nominees. On December 1, 2000, Wilbert also
amended its Schedule 13D reporting ownership of 14.1% of York's outstanding
common stock.

         On December 8, 2000, Messrs. Pendleton and Crawford contacted David M.
Kelly, chief executive officer of Matthews, by telephone regarding possible
business combinations between York and Matthews. They agreed to have further
discussions.

         On December 19, 2000, Mr. Crawford sent a letter to Mr. Zamec stating
that the continuation of discussions with Wilbert was not in the best interests
of York's stockholders, and that the York board of directors had concluded that
it could best maximize stockholder value by executing its refinancing plan. Mr.
Crawford noted that while Wilbert had released its proposal publicly, there
still was no specific proposal that would provide value to all York
stockholders.

         In late December 2000 and early January 2001, Mr. Kelly made telephone
calls to Messrs. Crawford and Pendleton regarding a possible transaction between
York and Matthews. On January 4, 2001, Messrs. Kelly, Crawford, Pendleton,
Elder, and Edward J. Boyle, vice president, accounting and finance, treasurer
and secretary of Matthews, met in Atlanta, Georgia to discuss the benefits of an
acquisition of York by Matthews.

         On January 8, 2001, Wilbert and Mr. Marvin Barbee transmitted a letter
to York requesting that York present certain persons as nominees for director at
York's 2001 annual meeting, who, if elected, would constitute the entire York
board of directors. The letter also invited York to propose certain persons in
the board of director's slate of nominees.

         On January 15, 2001, York executed a waiver and forbearance agreement
and consent with its lenders and received certain covenant waivers until June
2001 relating to its amended and restated credit agreement. Among other things,
the forbearance agreement also established interim debt reduction targets. To
achieve these targets and meet York's current management plans, York began to
divest certain assets, including its casket distribution operations and metal
vault manufacturing operations.

         On January 24, 2001, Messrs. Kelly, Crawford and Boyle met in
Pittsburgh to further discuss a potential transaction between York and Matthews,
including the process for determining the valuation of York, and a potential
price for York.

         On February 7, 2001, Mr. Zamec sent a letter to Mr. Crawford proposing
that Wilbert lend York $15 million in the form of a seven year debenture that
would be convertible in whole or in part, at Wilbert's option, into common stock
of York at a conversion price of $4.75. Repayment of the principal under the
loan would not begin

                                   -14-

until the third year of the loan. Among other conditions to the proposed
loan, Wilbert requested that Wilbert nominees constitute the majority of the
York board of directors at the closing of the loan, as well as the majority
of the directors proposed at its next annual meeting. Wilbert also asked the
York board of directors to take action exempting the transaction from York's
Shareholder Rights Plan and provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General
Corporation Law.

         At its February 19, 2001 meeting, the York board of directors discussed
Wilbert's proposal and potential responses. At that time, they also reviewed the
status of York's ongoing debt reduction activities. The York board of directors
unanimously agreed that the convertible loan proposal made by Wilbert and the
$4.75 per share conversion price was insufficient. At this meeting, the York
board of directors also discussed a potential transaction with Matthews and a
scheduled meeting between representatives from York and Matthews on February 20,
2001 in Atlanta. At this meeting, Messrs. Kelly, Crawford, Boyle and Dan Malone,
vice president finance and chief financial officer of York, discussed the terms
and valuation of a potential transaction between Matthews and York.

         On February 21, 2001, Mr. Crawford sent a letter to Mr. Zamec rejecting
Wilbert's proposal to lend York $15 million pursuant to a convertible note and
appoint a majority of the York board of directors.

         At a February 27, 2001 meeting, the York board of directors discussed a
possible proxy contest by Wilbert and the potential transaction with Matthews.

         On March 2, 2001, Mr. Zamec sent a letter of intent to Mr. Crawford
proposing to acquire all of the assets related to York's metal vault
manufacturing operations at a purchase price of $2.2 million in cash. At a March
5, 2001 meeting, the York board of directors compared Wilbert's offer to other
offers York received, which were far in excess of Wilbert's offer. This letter
of intent expired on March 15, 2001 without an acceptance by York.

         On March 16, 2001, Mr. Zamec sent a letter to the York board of
directors proposing a business combination transaction in which Wilbert would
acquire the outstanding common stock of those York stockholders desiring to sell
their stock for $6.50 per share. Wilbert also expressed its willingness to
provide stock in the combined entity in exchange for York shares for those
stockholders wishing to continue their ownership interest. Wilbert's proposal
was conditioned upon, among other things, a due diligence investigation, the
absence of a material adverse change in York's situation, and the approval of
the transaction by the York board of directors.

         In Houston on March 19 and March 20, 2001, Messrs. Kelly, Crawford,
Boyle and Malone met to discuss the terms of the potential acquisition of York
by Matthews.

         At a March 22, 2001 special meeting, the York board of directors
discussed Wilbert's March 16, 2001 correspondence and most recent Schedule 13D
filing. The York board of directors agreed to retain Houlihan Lokey as its
financial advisor to review York's alternatives, and discussed the ongoing
merger discussions with Matthews and the possible sale of York's commemorative
products segment to Matthews.

         At an April 2, 2001 special meeting of the York board of directors, Mr.
Crawford updated the board on the status of the merger discussions with Matthews
and the proposed sale of York's commemorative products segment to Matthews. Mr.
Crawford also reviewed the March 16, 2001 correspondence from Wilbert.

         From April 9 through April 12, 2001, York's representatives met with
the representatives of Matthews in Pittsburgh to discuss further the terms and
conditions of a possible sale of the commemorative products segment and a
potential merger of the companies.

         On April 18, 2001, the York board of directors met by telephone to
discuss Wilbert's March 16, 2001 correspondence proposing the purchase of York
stock from willing stockholders for $6.50 per share. At this meeting the York
board of directors also discussed the status of the proposed transactions with
Matthews. Later that day, the York board of directors met again by telephone and
discussed the terms of the proposed merger with Matthews and the proposed sale
of York's commemorative products segment to Matthews. Representatives from
Houlihan Lokey attended and participated in discussions concerning transaction
alternatives with Matthews and Wilbert, as well as refinancing options.

         On April 27, 2001, the York board of directors held a special meeting
at which Mr. Crawford reviewed the status of merger discussions with Matthews
and the proposed sale of York's commemorative products segment to Matthews. York
also publicly announced on that date that it had achieved the debt reduction
targets in its forbearance agreement by reducing its net debt to approximately
$40 million.

                                   -15-

         On May 1, 2001, Mr. Crawford sent a letter to Mr. Zamec rejecting
Wilbert's March 16 proposal.

         On May 3, 2001, York announced the sale of its metal vault
manufacturing operations, which sale was closed on May 21, 2001. York received
consideration substantially in excess of the amount Wilbert had offered for the
metal vault manufacturing operations, and used the sales price to further reduce
its debt.

         On May 10, 2001, Mr. Zamec sent a letter to the York board of directors
proposing a business combination transaction in which Wilbert would acquire all
outstanding common stock of York for $7.75 per share.

         From April 27, 2001 to May 23, 2001, representatives of York and
Matthews and their respective counsel continued to negotiate the terms of the
sale of York's commemorative products segment to Matthews and the terms of a
merger with Matthews, including the merger agreement and related agreements.

         On May 14, 2001, Mr. Zamec, Mr. Christenberry and Wilbert's legal
counsel met in Houston with Mr. Crawford, Mr. Malone and York's legal counsel,
to discuss Wilbert's May 10, 2001 offer to acquire the outstanding stock of York
and the maximum price Wilbert would be willing to offer.

         The York board of directors held a special meeting by telephone on May
18, 2001 to review the proposed sale of the commemorative products segment to
Matthews and the terms of the proposed merger with Matthews, and the results of
the meeting with Wilbert representatives on May 14, 2001. On May 23, 2001, the
York board of directors held a special meeting by telephone to (i) approve the
sale of the commemorative products segment to Matthews, (ii) approve the terms
of a merger with Matthews and (iii) receive the fairness opinion from Houlihan
Lokey with respect to the merger.

         During the evening of May 23, 2001 the merger agreement was executed by
York and Matthews and announced in a joint press release. The sale to Matthews
of the commemorative products segment was completed on May 24, 2001.

PURPOSE AND REASONS FOR THE MERGER

         The transaction was initiated by the York board of directors as a
result of its determination that a sale to a strategic buyer or financial
investor represented the most viable alternative to maximize stockholder value,
and the York board of directors believes that the merger presents the best
opportunity to maximize stockholder value.

         The primary benefit of the merger to York stockholders is the ability
of York stockholders to realize the value of their investment in York in cash at
a price which represents a substantial premium to the market price for the
common stock prior to the public announcement of the transaction. As a result of
the merger, York stockholders will cease to have any ownership interest in York
and will cease to participate in future earnings growth, if any, of York or to
benefit from the increase, if any, in the value of York. In addition, each
stockholder of York will recognize a taxable gain upon the completion of the
merger if and to the extent the amount of cash such stockholder receives in the
merger exceeds his or her tax basis in the York common stock.

RECOMMENDATION OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS

         THE YORK BOARD OF DIRECTORS BELIEVES THE TERMS OF THE MERGER ARE FAIR
TO, AND IN THE BEST INTERESTS OF, YORK AND ITS STOCKHOLDERS, HAS UNANIMOUSLY
APPROVED THE MERGER AGREEMENT, AND UNANIMOUSLY RECOMMENDS THAT STOCKHOLDERS VOTE
"FOR" ADOPTION OF THE MERGER AGREEMENT.

         In reaching its decision to approve the merger and the merger
agreement, the York board of directors consulted with its financial and legal
advisors and considered a variety of factors, including the following:

         o        a review of the possible alternatives to a sale of York,
                  including the offers by Wilbert and the prospects of
                  continuing to operate York as an independent company, the
                  value to stockholders of such alternatives, and the timing and
                  likelihood of achieving additional value from those
                  alternatives, as well as the possibility that York's future
                  performance might not lead to a stock price having a higher
                  present value than the merger consideration;

         o        a review of York's strategic goals, the capital necessary to
                  implement those goals, the timing and likelihood of obtaining
                  the capital necessary to implement those goals, and the
                  possibility that the

                                   -16-

                  accomplishment of such goals might not lead to a stock price
                  having a higher present value than the merger consideration;

         o        a review of the offers made by Wilbert to acquire York common
                  stock and assessing Wilbert's ability to raise capital to
                  complete such a transaction;

         o        the sale of the commemorative products segment to Matthews,
                  which allowed York to pay down its outstanding principal
                  balance on its amended and restated credit agreement;

         o        the opinion of Houlihan Lokey, York's financial advisor, that
                  the cash merger consideration to be received by York
                  stockholders was fair to stockholders from a financial point
                  of view, and the financial analyses conducted by Houlihan
                  Lokey in reaching its opinion, as described under "-- Opinion
                  of York's Financial Advisor";

         o        the determination of the York board of directors that the
                  merger consideration to be paid for each share of common stock
                  of York is fair to the stockholders and that it would be in
                  the best interests of York and its stockholders to enter into
                  the merger agreement and related agreements; and

         o        the amount of consideration offered to York stockholders,
                  which, based upon the cash merger consideration of $10.00 per
                  share, represents a premium of 28.5%, 73.6%, 77.8%, 150.0%,
                  and 185.0% over the average York closing prices for the 10-day
                  period, the 30-day period, the 60-day period, the 90-day
                  period and the 180-day period, respectively, preceding May 24,
                  2001.

         The York board of directors also considered certain countervailing
factors in its deliberations concerning the merger and the merger agreement,
including:

         o        the potential disruption to York's business that might result
                  from undertaking the merger process;

         o        the uncertainty regarding stockholders', customers' and
                  employees' perception of the merger;

         o        the contractual obligations of York, such as a no solicitation
                  covenant, and the transaction expenses to be incurred by York
                  prior to the completion of the merger;

         o        the payments required to terminate York's contract obligations
                  to certain officers and directors. See "--Interests of Certain
                  Persons in the Merger";

         o        the possibility that the merger may not be consummated because
                  York is unable to meet the Threshold EBITDA financial test, or
                  other conditions to the merger are not met by York; and

         o        the required payment by York in certain circumstances of a
                  termination fee and expenses under the merger agreement. See
                  "The Merger Agreement--Termination, Termination Fees,
                  Amendment and Waiver."

         The York board of directors determined that the countervailing factors
did not outweigh the positive attributes of the merger.

                                   -17-

         The foregoing discussion of the information and factors discussed by
the York board of directors is not meant to be exhaustive but includes all
material factors considered by the York board of directors. The York board of
directors did not quantify or attach any particular weight to the various
factors that it considered in reaching its determination that the merger
agreement and the merger are fair to and in the best interests of York
stockholders, including its belief that the merger is fair to stockholders.
Rather, the York board of directors viewed its position and recommendation as
being based on the totality of the information presented to and considered by
it. As a result of its consideration of the foregoing and other relevant
considerations, the York board of directors unanimously determined that the
merger agreement and the merger are advisable to and in the best interests of
York stockholders and approved the merger agreement.

         THE YORK BOARD OF DIRECTORS UNANIMOUSLY RECOMMENDS THAT STOCKHOLDERS
VOTE "FOR" ADOPTION OF THE MERGER AGREEMENT.

EFFECTS OF THE MERGER; MERGER CONSIDERATION

         The merger agreement provides for the merger of Empire into York, with
York surviving the merger as a subsidiary of Matthews. Each share of common
stock of York issued and outstanding at the effective time of the merger, except
shares held by stockholders who properly exercise their appraisal rights under
Delaware law and shares held by Matthews or by any wholly-owned subsidiary or
affiliate of Matthews (which will be cancelled), will be converted into the
right to receive (1) $10.00 in cash, without interest, plus (2) the Excess Cash
Increment (as defined below). The merger agreement provides that the per share
merger consideration will not be less than $10.00 nor more than $11.00. The
calculation of the Excess Cash Increment will be made after October 31, 2001,
and the amount per share above $10.00, if any, to be received by York
stockholders will then be announced by press release and included in a current
report on Form 8-K to be filed by York. No further stockholder vote will be
taken at that time and the parties will proceed under the merger agreement to
attempt to close the merger.

         The capitalized terms that are set forth in the definitions below but
are not defined therein are defined in the merger agreement. Please refer to the
merger agreement for the complete definitions.

         Excess Cash Increment = A - ($6.9 MILLION + B + C + D + E + F + G) + (H + I)
                                 ----------------------------------------------------
                                                  Outstanding Shares

         The merger agreement provides that the Excess Cash Increment shall not
be less than zero.

         "A" is "York Cash." "York Cash" means the total cash and Cash
Equivalents of York and its Subsidiaries at October 31, 2001, plus the Selected
Property Value. In general, "Selected Property Value" is a percentage of the
appraised value of specified properties that York currently has for sale.

         "B" is "Present Value Environmental Remediation Costs." "Present Value
Environmental Remediation Costs" means the present value cost (discounted at
7.5%) of the Environmental Remediation Costs that are not paid on or before
October 31, 2001. In general, "Environmental Remediation Costs" are the costs to
clean up certain environmental conditions at specified properties.

         "C" is the premium not otherwise paid by York on or before October 31,
2001 for cost cap coverage from AIG or a similarly rated insurance company for
each facility having an environmental remediation probable-cost estimate
exceeding $100,000 so that the parties may protect against actual costs of
remediation at such facility exceeding the amount of the Environmental
Remediation Costs applicable to such facility.

         "D" is the legal, accounting, environmental consulting and investment
banking fees and expenses incurred or accrued and not paid by York and its
subsidiaries on or before October 31, 2001 in connection with the merger
agreement and completing the merger, or are reasonably anticipated by York to be
incurred by York prior to the completion of the merger.

         "E" is the costs of settling, cashing out or causing to be cancelled
all York Stock Options not exercised on or before October 31, 2001 and Deferred
Stock less, in the case of York Stock Options, any exercise price to be paid to
York by the optionee.

         "F" is the amount by which Adjusted Working Capital is greater that
$13.2 million or less than $10.2 million on October 31, 2001. If Adjusted
Working Capital as of October 31, 2001 is greater than $13.2 million, the excess
amount shall be a negative number and have the effect of increasing the Excess
Cash Increment, but if the

                                   -18-

Adjusted Working Capital as of October 31, 2001 is less than $10.2 million,
the deficiency shall be a positive number and have the effect of decreasing
the Excess Cash Increment.

         "G" is all funded indebtedness, and any capitalized lease obligations
first incurred after the date of the merger agreement, of York and its
subsidiaries on October 31, 2001.

         "H" is any cash paid for severance, retention, transition or
integration costs to the extent that York and Matthews agree to the same in
writing.

         "I" is any indemnity to which York would be entitled under the Asset
Purchase Agreement among Matthews, Empire Stock Corp., York, York Bronze Company
and OMC Industries, Inc., the Stock Purchase Agreement by and between Matthews,
Empire Stock Corp. and York dated concurrently with the merger agreement and any
other document related thereto, but which has not been paid due to the
deductible basket amounts provided for in those agreements or for any other
reason.

         "Outstanding Shares" shall mean the total number of shares of York
common stock outstanding on October 31, 2001.

         Immediately prior to the completion of the merger, York will settle,
cash out or cause to be cancelled all options to purchase shares of York common
stock ("York Stock Options") and any shares of common stock that have been
deferred ("Deferred Stock") pursuant to the York Non-Employee Director Cash and
Equity Compensation Plan (the "Director Deferral Plan"), such that all York
Stock Options and rights to Deferred Stock are terminated prior to the
completion of the merger. Matthews will not be required to pay for, as part of
the merger consideration, any Deferred Stock, and any York Stock Options that
are not vested and exercised prior to October 31, 2001.

         Each share of common stock of Empire issued and outstanding at the
effective time of the merger will be converted into and exchanged for one share
of stock of York. As a result of the merger, Matthews will own all of the issued
and outstanding capital stock of York.

         The merger will be effective upon the filing of a Certificate of Merger
with the Delaware Secretary of State. The filing of the Certificate of Merger is
expected to occur promptly after all of the conditions to the merger set forth
in the merger agreement have been satisfied or waived. See "The Merger
Agreement--Conditions to the Merger." The merger will have the effect set forth
under Delaware law. More specifically, at the effective time of the merger, all
of the property, rights, privileges, powers and franchises of York and Empire
will be vested in the surviving corporation, and all of the debts, liabilities
and duties of York and Empire will become the debts, liabilities and duties of
the surviving corporation.

         The directors of Empire immediately prior to the effective time of the
merger will be the directors of the surviving corporation and will serve until
their respective successors are duly elected. The officers of Empire immediately
prior to the effective time of the merger will be the officers of the surviving
corporation and will serve until their respective successors are duly elected.
The certificate of incorporation and bylaws of Empire will be the certificate of
incorporation and bylaws of the surviving corporation until duly amended in
accordance with applicable law. However, the certificate of incorporation will
be amended so that the name of the surviving corporation will be "The York
Group, Inc."

         If the merger is consummated, York will no longer be required to file
periodic reports under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, including annual
reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, proxy statements and other
non-periodic reports such as Forms 8-K.

OPINION OF YORK'S FINANCIAL ADVISOR

         Houlihan Lokey Howard & Zukin Financial Advisors, Inc. has delivered
its opinion dated May 23, 2001 to the York board of directors to the effect
that, as of such date and based upon and subject to certain matters stated in
such opinion, the consideration to be paid by Matthews in connection with the
merger is fair to the stockholders of York from a financial point of view. The
full text of Houlihan Lokey's written opinion, which sets forth the assumptions
made, matters considered and limitations on the review undertaken by Houlihan
Lokey, has been attached as Annex B to this document. Houlihan Lokey's opinion
is directed only to the fairness, from a financial point of view, of the
consideration to be paid by Matthews in connection with the merger, and is not
intended to constitute, and does not constitute, a recommendation as to how a
stockholder should vote with respect to the approval of the adoption of the
merger agreement. You are urged to read this opinion carefully in its entirety.

                                   -19-

         The York board of directors retained Houlihan Lokey pursuant to an
engagement letter dated April 5, 2001 to render an opinion as to the fairness to
the stockholders of York, from a financial point of view, of the consideration
to be received by them in connection with the merger. Houlihan Lokey is a
nationally recognized investment banking firm, and was selected by the York
board of directors based on Houlihan Lokey's reputation and experience in
investment banking in general and its recognized expertise in the valuation of
assets and businesses entities. On May 23, 2001, at a meeting of the York board
of directors, Houlihan Lokey delivered to the York board of directors its
written opinion, attached hereto as Annex B, that the consideration to be paid
for the transaction is fair to the stockholders of York from a financial point
of view.

         The opinion of Houlihan Lokey does not address York's underlying
business decision to effect the merger. Houlihan Lokey has not been requested
to, and did not, solicit third party indications of interest in acquiring all or
any part of York. Furthermore, at the request of the York board of directors,
Houlihan Lokey has not negotiated the terms of the merger on York's behalf.

         Houlihan Lokey considered the following background factors in preparing
the fairness opinion. Houlihan Lokey did not specifically weigh each factor
considered, and some factors did not impact its determination of the fairness of
the merger.

         Although Houlihan Lokey ultimately based its opinion on the economic
analysis of the merger, it did, however, consider the following general
background factors:

         o        there are few other logical strategic buyers of the assets;

         o        the industry in general is not subject to high growth rates or
                  extreme cyclicality; and

         o        largely unsuccessful consolidation, roll-up, and expansion
                  schemes reshaped the industry during the 1990s.

         In connection with its fairness opinion, Houlihan Lokey made such
reviews, analyses and inquiries as it deemed necessary and appropriate under the
circumstances. Among other things, Houlihan Lokey:

         o        reviewed York's annual reports to stockholders and on Form
                  10-K for the fiscal years ended December 31, 1995 through
                  2000, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q for the years 1999 and
                  2000, and Company-prepared interim financial statements for
                  the four-month period ended April 30, 2001, which York's
                  management had identified as being the most current financial
                  statements available;

         o        reviewed draft copies of the merger agreement;

         o        met with certain members of the senior management of York to
                  discuss the operations, financial condition, future prospects
                  and projected operations and performance of York, and met with
                  representatives of York's counsel to discuss certain matters;

         o        visited certain facilities and business offices of York;

         o        reviewed forecasts and projections prepared by York's
                  management for the year ending December 31, 2001; o reviewed
                  the historical market prices and trading volume for York's
                  publicly traded securities;

         o        reviewed certain other publicly available financial data for
                  certain companies that were deemed comparable to York and
                  publicly available prices and premiums paid in other
                  transactions that were considered similar to the merger;

         o        reviewed drafts of certain documents to be delivered at the
                  closing of the merger; and

         o        conducted such other studies, analyses and inquiries as were
                  deemed appropriate under the circumstances for rendering its
                  opinion.

         Houlihan Lokey did not independently verify the accuracy and
completeness of the information supplied to it with respect to York's business
and its assets and did not assume any responsibility with respect to such
information. Houlihan Lokey did not make any independent appraisal of any of the
properties or assets involved in the merger. Houlihan Lokey recognizes that, as
with any potential merger or acquisition, there are inherent risks that could
prevent the transaction from being consummated. Houlihan Lokey also recognizes
that because the merger is conditioned upon York's ability to achieve a
negotiated EBITDA target level, there is increased risk that the merger may not
close.

         The Houlihan Lokey opinion is necessarily based on business, economic,
market and other conditions as they existed and could be evaluated by Houlihan
Lokey at the date of the opinion. Furthermore, Houlihan Lokey has relied upon
and assumed, without independent verification, that (a) York-prepared financial
forecasts and projections used in its analysis have been reasonably prepared and
reflect the best currently available estimates of

                                   -20-

the future financial results and condition of York and (b) there has been no
material change in the assets, financial condition, business or prospects of
York since the date of the most recent financial statements made available to
it.

         The Houlihan Lokey opinion was prepared for the information of the York
board of directors in connection with its evaluation of the merger and did not
constitute a recommendation to York, the York board of directors, or any holder
of shares of the common stock of York as to whether to enter into the merger or
to take any other action.

         York has paid Houlihan Lokey fees of $240,000 for its services in
connection with the engagement letter and has agreed to reimburse Houlihan Lokey
for reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection therewith,
including reasonable fees and expenses of its legal counsel. No portion of the
fee is contingent upon the consummation of the merger or the conclusions reached
in the opinion.

COMPANY-SPECIFIC VALUATION CONSIDERATIONS

         According to Houlihan Lokey, an analysis of company-specific factors
serves as a basis for comparing the subject company to other industry
participants. Some of the factors examined were demographics, product demand,
quality of management, diversity of operations, and access to capital.
Generally, the best-positioned firms should exceed industry norms in both good
times and bad, while the worst-positioned firms should experience sub-par
performance. Houlihan Lokey determined that York is not in as favorable a
position as most of its peers in the deathcare industry, both public and
private.

VALUATION METHODOLOGY

         The fundamental premise on which all investment decisions are based is
that value to a potential investor is equal to the present worth of future
benefits. This basic concept can be applied to the valuation of an entire
company or to particular securities that comprise the capital structure of that
company. In each instance, it is a matter of identifying the future returns to
the investor that the company can be reasonably expected to generate, and
determining their present value in the context of the uncertainty associated
with realizing such returns.

         There are two bases on which to determine the value of a company:
going-concern and liquidation. In the case of a company that is expected to
continue operating well into the future, the prospective investor will evaluate
the risks and expected returns of the investment on a going-concern basis. The
primary concern is not with the individual values of enterprise assets, but with
their ability to generate the returns expected in the future. Only secondarily
is the investor interested in individual asset values, and this from the
standpoint of security or collateral for the investment if for any reason the
company should choose to liquidate. In such a case, liquidation values for the
assets, as well as all costs associated with liquidation, would prevail.

         When determining the value of an on-going business enterprise, there
are three general approaches available to the valuation professional: the market
approach, the income approach, and the asset approach. The choice of which
approach to use in a particular situation will depend upon the specific facts
and circumstances associated with the company, as well as the purpose for which
the valuation analysis is being conducted.

         Houlihan Lokey utilized several valuation methodologies in its analysis
of the fairness of the consideration to be paid by Matthews for York's business.
These approaches are summarized below.

         MARKET APPROACH. The Market Approach is one of determining a level of
earnings which is considered to be representative of the future performance of
the company, and capitalizing this figure by an appropriate risk-adjusted rate.
This approach provides an indication of value for the security which corresponds
with the particular earnings figure being capitalized (for example, capitalizing
net earnings available to common stock holders would yield an indication of
value for the common stock). There are several different forms of "earnings"
used in the market approach, because each form isolates particular nuances of
the company's operating performance.

         The various "earnings" figures used in Houlihan Lokey's analysis,
earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization ("EBITDA") and
earnings before interest and taxes ("EBIT"), are debt-free variations of the
conventional net income figure determined according to generally accepted
accounting principles. Debt-free market multiples relate the company's
Enterprise Value ("EV"), or debt (net of cash) and equity, to earnings figures
from which no interest expense has been deducted. The more common debt-free
multiples are total invested capital/earnings before interest, taxes,
depreciation and amortization ("EV/EBITDA"), and total invested capital/earnings
before interest and taxes ("EV/EBIT"). The use of these multiples may be
appropriate when comparing companies that have substantially different amounts
of financial leverage, because the multiples are based on total company value,
which is generally independent of the amount of leverage in the company's
capital

                                   -21-

structure. Their use effectively separates the issue of company valuation
from the specific financing decisions that are made to operate the business.
Furthermore, EV/EBITDA and EV/EBIT multiples, which are developed from
pre-tax earnings figures, may be appropriate when comparing companies that
have substantially different income tax situations, as well as different
amounts of financial leverage. In general, these debt-free methods reduce
distortions in price/cash flow and price/earnings multiples that might be
present due to differences in financial leverage or income taxes among firms.

         The capitalization rate is an expression of what investors believe to
be a fair and reasonable rate of return for the particular security, given the
inherent risks of ownership. It incorporates expectations of growth and rests on
the implicit assumption that some level of earnings will be generated by the
enterprise into perpetuity. The most common means of obtaining capitalization
rates is through the market comparison method, whereby companies having their
stock traded in the public market are selected for comparison purposes and used
as a basis for choosing reasonable capitalization rates for the subject company.
Capitalization rates obtained in this manner are generally expressed as ratios
of the various earnings figures, and are referred to as "market multiples."
Another common method of obtaining such multiples is to examine companies that
have recently been sold in the public marketplace. For this method, the total
price paid for the company is related to earnings figures which yield implied
transaction multiples. The acquired company is then compared with the subject
company on the basis of risk and expected return, and its transaction multiples
are used as a basis for selecting appropriate multiples for the subject company.

         In using the Market Approach, Houlihan Lokey applied market based
multiples of comparable public companies to representative projected earnings
levels of York, adjusted the enterprise value downward for any net debt, and
applied a 30% control premium to arrive at its control market value of equity
range.

         Also under the Market Approach, comparable market transactions are
considered and applied to the selected earnings levels. However, there were no
recorded transactions that involved companies similar to York or Matthews in a
time period reasonable to consider comparable multiples.

         INCOME APPROACH. The Income Approach, or Discounted Cash Flow ("DCF")
approach, is another popular method of determining the fair market value of a
company. The approach is one of estimating the present value of the projected
future cash flows to be generated from the business and theoretically available
(though not necessarily paid) to the capital providers of the company. In the
DCF approach, the counterpart to the market multiple described above is the
discount rate applied to the projected future cash flows to arrive at the
present value. The discount rate is intended to reflect all risks of ownership
and the associated risks of realizing the stream of projected future cash flows.
It can also be interpreted as the rate of return that would be required by
providers of capital to the company to compensate them for the time value of
their money, as well as the risk inherent in the particular investment. Unlike
the market multiple, however, the discount rate employed in the DCF approach
contains no implicit expectations of growth for the cash flows. Instead, the
projected cash flows themselves reveal growth expectations, while allowing for a
great deal more flexibility in projecting such growth rates.

         In contrast to the "cash flow" figures used in the Market Approach, the
figure used in the DCF approach more accurately represents the true cash flow
being generated by the operations of the business. In short, it incorporates
cash expenditures on working capital and fixed assets, while also recognizing
the non-cash expenses contained in earnings figures. The cash flows are
typically projected over a limited number of years, which will depend on the
planning horizon of the specific firm and other factors related to the
particular industry and the general economy. As a result, it is necessary to
compute a terminal value as of the end of the last period for which cash flow is
projected. This terminal value is essentially an estimate of the value of the
enterprise as of that future point in time, and it incorporates the assumptions
of perpetual operations and implicit growth found in the market approach.
Discounting each of the projected future cash flows and the terminal value back
to the present, and summing the results, yields an indication of value for the
enterprise as a whole.

         When used in combination, the various forms of the Market Approach and
the DCF approach can lead to a reasonable indication of value for the subject
company and its securities. However, these approaches do not generally capture
the value of assets and liabilities that are not required for the operation of
the business. Examples of such "non-operating" assets and liabilities include
excess cash, investments not related to the business, unnecessary land and
equipment, and contingent liabilities. If such items exist, they must be valued
separately and used to adjust the going-concern value indications obtained by
the market and DCF approaches.

         In applying the DCF approach, Houlihan Lokey discounted the projected
earnings of York using the Gordon Growth Model ("GGM"). Houlihan Lokey selected
the GGM because only one year of projections were available from management.
Considering the risk of obtaining these projections, York's inherent operating
risks,

                                   -22-

and the time value of money, the projected debt-free earnings were discounted
at rates ranging from 10.5% to 14.0%; and growth rates ranging from 1% to 3%
in perpetuity. In arriving at its control market value of equity under this
approach, Houlihan Lokey adjusted the enterprise value downward for any net
debt.

         ASSET APPROACH. The Asset Approach, also called the adjusted book value
approach, differs from the Market and DCF approaches in two important ways.
First, it focuses on individual asset and liability values from the company's
balance sheet, which are adjusted to fair market value. In contrast, the Market
and DCF approaches focus on the aggregate returns generated by all the company's
assets. Second, it can be applied in situations where liquidation is imminent.
The Market and DCF approaches have very limited to no applicability in a
liquidation scenario.

         The Asset Approach can also be used in going-concern situations to
provide an additional indication of value. The approach may be appropriate in
instances where the subject company has a heavy investment in tangible assets or
where operating earnings are insignificant relative to the value of the
underlying assets, such as in real estate holding companies and start-up
businesses. Furthermore, it may not be the best approach in instances where the
company has substantial operating earnings relative to the value of the
underlying assets. In such cases, the residual equity value resulting from the
adjusted book value approach may not reflect the value inherent in the company's
superior cash-generating capability. For the reasons listed above, Houlihan
Lokey did not apply the Asset Approach.

         However, consideration was given to certain assets, namely distribution
centers and real property, that are held for sale by York. In the event that
certain of those assets are not sold before closing the merger, Matthews will
give credit in the Excess Cash Increment calculation equal to fifty percent of
the appraised value for each asset. As of the date Houlihan Lokey issued its
fairness opinion, York held for sale assets with an appraised value of $5.7
million. Houlihan Lokey assumed, for purposes of its analysis, that all of the
assets held for sale by York would be sold by the closing of the merger.

         Houlihan Lokey concluded that the "Control Market Value of Equity" for
York was approximately $65,000,000 to $75,000,000. On this basis, Houlihan Lokey
concluded that the value of consideration of approximately $90,610,000 for the
acquisition of York, discounted from the anticipated closing date, together with
the assumption of all of the liabilities, is fair from a financial point of
view.

CERTAIN TRANSACTIONS AND RELATIONS BETWEEN YORK AND MATTHEWS

         On May 24, 2001, York sold the businesses which comprise its
commemorative products segment to Matthews for net cash proceeds of $45 million.
In connection with the transaction, Matthews acquired York's manufacturing
facilities in Kingwood, West Virginia and Bryan, Texas.

                                   -23-

INTERESTS OF CERTAIN PERSONS IN THE MERGER

         In considering the recommendation of the York board of directors with
respect to the merger, stockholders of York should be aware that the directors
and executive officers of York have certain interests in the merger that may be
different from, or in addition to, the interests of the stockholders of York.
The York board of directors was aware of these interests and considered them,
among other factors, in approving the merger agreement. These interests are
summarized below.

         CHANGE OF CONTROL AGREEMENTS: York executed change of control
agreements in December 2000 with certain of its executive officers, including
Thomas J. Crawford, David F. Beck, Cristen L. Cline, Mark W. Hornibrook, Dennis
C. Laphan, Dan E. Malone, Sandra A. Matson, Robert T. Monteleone, Gerard K.
Nichols, Angela Sizemore, and Ken Smith, which agreements have a term of two (2)
years. The agreements provide that in the event of a change of control of York,
if the executive is terminated without good cause (as defined in the agreements)
or he or she voluntarily terminates employment for good reason (as defined in
the agreements) within one year of the change of control, he or she will be
entitled to (1) a lump-sum payment equal to a multiple (Mr. Crawford: three
times (3x); all others: one times (1x)) of his or her base salary in the year
immediately preceding the termination, and (2) continuation of health care and
life insurance benefits for one year following the termination. The agreements
also provide that the executive will be paid an additional amount, which when
added to the lump sum payment, will place the executive in the same after-tax
position as if any excise tax imposed by the Internal Revenue Code did not apply
to any of the amounts payable under the agreement. The merger will constitute a
change of control of York for purposes of the agreements.

         INDEMNIFICATION AND INSURANCE. After the effective time of the merger,
Matthews and the surviving corporation have agreed to indemnify, hold harmless,
and defend each and every present and former director, officer, employee,
fiduciary, and agent of York and each subsidiary of York from and against all
attorneys' fees, judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages, liabilities,
settlement amounts, costs and expenses in connection with any claim, action,
suit, proceeding or investigation arising out of or pertaining to any action or
omission in their capacity as an officer, director, employee, fiduciary or agent
(including the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement).

         In addition, for a period of six years from the effective time of the
merger, the surviving corporation and Matthews will provide to the indemnified
parties liability insurance protection substantially equivalent to that provided
by York's current directors' and officers' liability insurance policies.

ACCOUNTING TREATMENT

         The merger will be accounted for by Empire as a "purchase" in
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Consequently, the
aggregate consideration paid by Empire in connection with the merger will be
allocated to York's assets and liabilities based upon their fair values, with
any excess being treated as goodwill.

REGULATORY MATTERS

         Under the HSR Act, certain mergers and acquisitions may not be
consummated unless notice has been given and certain information has been
furnished to the Antitrust Division of the U. S. Department of Justice and the
Federal Trade Commission and all required waiting periods have expired. A notice
is expected to be filed in the first week of September 2001 with the Federal
Trade Commission and the Department of Justice. In addition, York and Matthews
expect to make all other filings required under other antitrust or competition
laws or by other antitrust authorities.

         The obligations of York, Matthews, and Empire to consummate the merger
are subject to the condition that there be no temporary restraining order,
preliminary or permanent injunction or other order issued by any court or other
legal or regulatory restraint prohibiting consummation of the merger. Neither
York, Empire, nor Matthews are aware of any foreign governmental approvals or
actions that may be required for consummation of the merger.

FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSEQUENCES

         The following discussion summarizes the material federal income tax
consequences of the merger. The discussion is based on the Internal Revenue Code
of 1986, as amended, existing and proposed United States Treasury regulations
promulgated under the Internal Revenue Code, rulings, administrative
pronouncements and

                                   -24-

judicial decisions. Changes in any of these areas could materially affect the
tax consequences described in this Proxy Statement and could be made on a
retroactive basis.

         The receipt of cash by stockholders in exchange for their common stock
of York will be a taxable transaction for federal income tax purposes and may
also be a taxable transaction under applicable state, local and foreign income
and other tax laws. The tax consequences of the receipt of cash may vary
depending upon, among other things, a stockholder's particular circumstances. In
general, however, a stockholder will recognize a gain or a loss for federal
income tax purposes equal to the difference between the adjusted tax basis of
the stockholder's shares of common stock and the amount of cash received by the
stockholder in exchange for those shares. This gain or loss generally will be:

         o        calculated separately for each block of shares (i.e., shares
                  acquired at the same cost in a single transaction) exchanged
                  pursuant to the merger;

         o        a capital gain or loss if the shares of common stock are a
                  capital asset in the hands of the stockholder; and

         o        a long-term gain or loss if the stockholder has held his or
                  her shares of common stock for more than one year at the
                  effective time of the merger.

         The receipt of cash by a stockholder pursuant to the merger may be
subject to backup withholding. Backup withholding will not take place if the
stockholder provides a certified taxpayer identification number on Form W-9 and
otherwise complies with the backup withholding rules or demonstrates that the
stockholder is exempt from backup withholding. Backup withholding is not an
additional tax; any amounts withheld may be credited against the stockholder's
federal income tax liability.

         The foregoing discussion does not address all aspects of federal income
taxation that may be relevant to a stockholder. The foregoing discussion may
also not apply to:

         o        stockholders who acquired their common stock pursuant to the
                  exercise of employee stock options or other compensation
                  arrangements with York;

         o        stockholders who are not citizens or residents of the United
                  States;

         o        stockholders who perfect their appraisal rights; or

         o        stockholders who are subject to special tax treatment under
                  the Internal Revenue Code (such as dealers in securities,
                  insurance companies, other financial institutions, regulated
                  investment companies, stockholders who hold their shares as
                  part of a hedge, straddle, or conversion transaction, and
                  tax-exempt entities).

         Because of the individual nature of tax consequences, stockholders are
urged to consult their personal tax advisors to determine precisely the tax
consequences of the merger to them, including the effects of state, local or
foreign income or other tax laws or federal tax laws other than those pertaining
to income tax.

APPRAISAL RIGHTS UNDER DELAWARE LAW

         If the merger is consummated, York stockholders who do not vote in
favor of the adoption of the merger agreement, who hold shares of common stock
of York on the date of making a written demand for appraisal as described below,
and who otherwise comply fully with Section 262 of the Delaware General
Corporation Law ("Section 262") will be entitled to a judicial determination of
the fair value of their shares of common stock of York in accordance with
Section 262 and to receive from the surviving corporation payment of such fair
value in cash, together with a fair rate of interest, if any, as determined by
such court. York stockholders who properly perfect their appraisal rights will
not be entitled to surrender their shares of common stock of York for payment in
the manner provided in the merger agreement and described in this Proxy
Statement.

         Under Section 262, when a merger agreement is to be submitted for
approval and adoption at a meeting of stockholders, as in the case of the
Special Meeting, not less than 20 calendar days prior to the meeting, a
constituent corporation in the merger must notify each of the holders of its
stock who was a holder on the record date for the

                                   -25-

meeting that such appraisal rights are available and include in each such
notice a copy of Section 262. This Proxy Statement constitutes such notice to
the holders of record of the common stock of York.

         The following is a summary of the procedures to be followed under
Section 262, the full text of which is attached as Annex C to this Proxy
Statement. The summary does not purport to be a complete statement of, and is
qualified in its entirety by reference to, Section 262 and to any applicable
amendments to such section after the date of this Proxy Statement. Failure to
follow any Section 262 procedures may result in the loss of appraisal rights
under Section 262. Stockholders should assume that the surviving corporation
will take no action to perfect any appraisal rights of any stockholder. Any
stockholder who desires to exercise his or her appraisal rights should review
carefully Section 262 and is urged to consult his or her legal advisor before
electing or attempting to exercise such rights.

         Holders of record of shares of common stock of York who desire to
exercise their appraisal rights must deliver a separate written demand for
appraisal of such shares to York prior to the taking of the vote on the adoption
of the merger agreement and must not vote in favor of the adoption of the merger
agreement at the time the vote is taken. In addition, a holder of shares of
common stock of York wishing to exercise appraisal rights must hold of record
such shares on the date the written demand for appraisal is made and must
continue to hold such shares through the effective time of the merger. The
demand for appraisal will be sufficient if it reasonably informs York of the
identity of the York stockholder and that the York stockholder intends to demand
an appraisal of the fair value of his, her or its shares of common stock of
York.

         If the shares of common stock of York are owned of record in a
fiduciary capacity, such as by a trustee, guardian or custodian, the demand must
be executed by or for the record owner, and if the shares of common stock of
York are owned of record by more than one person, as in a joint tenancy or
tenancy in common, the demand must be made by or for all owners of record. An
authorized agent, including an agent for one or more joint owners, may execute
the demand for appraisal for a holder of record; however, such agent must
identify the record owner or owners and expressly disclose in such demand that
the agent is acting as agent for the record owner or owners of such shares.

         A record holder, such as a broker, who holds shares of common stock of
York as a nominee for beneficial owners, some or all of whom desire to demand
appraisal, must exercise appraisal rights on behalf of such beneficial owners
with respect to the shares held for such beneficial owners. In such case, the
written demand for appraisal should set forth the number of shares covered by
such demand. Unless a demand for appraisal specifies a number of shares, the
demand will be presumed to cover all shares outstanding in the name of such
record owner. If a York stockholder holds shares of common stock of York through
a broker who in turn holds the shares through a central securities depository
nominee, a demand for appraisal of such shares must be made by or on behalf of
the depository nominee and must identify the depository nominee as record
holder.

         BENEFICIAL OWNERS WHO ARE NOT RECORD OWNERS AND WHO INTEND TO EXERCISE
APPRAISAL RIGHTS SHOULD INSTRUCT THE RECORD OWNER TO COMPLY STRICTLY WITH THE
STATUTORY REQUIREMENTS WITH RESPECT TO THE DELIVERY OF WRITTEN DEMAND FOR
APPRAISAL. A DEMAND FOR APPRAISAL SUBMITTED BY A BENEFICIAL OWNER WHO IS NOT THE
RECORD OWNER WILL NOT BE HONORED.

         Failure to vote against the merger agreement will not constitute a
waiver of a stockholder's appraisal rights. A proxy or vote against the merger
agreement will not constitute a demand for appraisal. Stockholders should not
expect to receive any additional notice with respect to the deadline for
demanding appraisal rights.

         Any York stockholder who elects to exercise appraisal rights must mail
or deliver the written demand for appraisal to The York Group, Inc., 8554 Katy
Freeway, Suite 200, Houston, Texas 77024, Attention: Cristen L. Cline, Corporate
Secretary.

         If the merger agreement is approved by York stockholders, then within
ten days after the effective time of the merger, the surviving corporation will
provide notice of the effective time of the merger to all York stockholders who
have complied with Section 262.

         A York stockholder may withdraw his or her demand for appraisal within
60 days after the effective time of the merger and accept the terms of the
merger. Thereafter, the written approval of the surviving corporation will be
needed for such a withdrawal.

                                   -26-

         Within 120 days after the effective time of the merger (the "120-Day
Period"), in compliance with Section 262, any York stockholder who has properly
demanded an appraisal and who has not withdrawn his or her demand as provided
above (such York stockholders being referred to collectively as the "Dissenting
Stockholders") and the surviving corporation each has the right to file in the
Delaware Court of Chancery (the "Delaware Court") a petition (the "Petition"),
with a copy served on the surviving corporation in the case of a Petition filed
by a Dissenting Stockholder, demanding a determination of the fair value of the
shares held by all of the Dissenting Stockholders. If, within the 120-Day
Period, no Petition has been filed as provided above, all rights to appraisal
cease and all Dissenting Stockholders who owned shares of common stock of York
become entitled to receive, for each share of common stock of York the merger
consideration, as if such Dissenting Stockholders had initially voted to approve
and adopt the merger. The surviving corporation is not obligated and does not
currently intend to file such a Petition.

         Any Dissenting Stockholder is entitled, within the 120-Day Period and
upon written request to the surviving corporation, to receive from the surviving
corporation a statement setting forth (1) the aggregate number of shares of
common stock of York which have not voted to adopt and approve the merger and
with respect to which demands for appraisal have been received and (2) the
aggregate number of Dissenting Stockholders. Such statement must be mailed (1)
within ten days after a written request therefor has been received by the
surviving corporation, or (2) within ten days after the expiration of the period
for the delivery of demands, as described above, whichever is later.

         Upon the filing of a Petition, the Delaware Court may order a hearing
and that notice of the time and place fixed for the hearing on the Petition be
sent by registered or certified mail to the surviving corporation and all
Dissenting Stockholders. Notice will also be published at least one week before
the day of the hearing in a newspaper of general circulation published in the
City of Wilmington, Delaware, or in another publication deemed advisable by the
Delaware Court. The costs relating to these notices will be borne by the
surviving corporation.

         If a hearing on the Petition is held, the Delaware Court is empowered
to determine which Dissenting Stockholders have complied with the provisions of
Section 262 and are entitled to an appraisal of their shares. The Delaware Court
may require that Dissenting Stockholders submit their share certificates for
notation thereon of the pendency of the appraisal proceedings and the Delaware
Court may dismiss the proceedings as to any Dissenting Stockholder who does not
comply with such requirement.

         The Delaware Court will appraise shares of common stock of York owned
by the Dissenting Stockholders, determining the fair value of such shares
exclusive of any element of value arising from the accomplishment or expectation
of the merger. In determining the fair value, the Delaware Court is to take into
account all relevant factors. In Weinberger v. UOP, Inc., the Delaware Supreme
Court discussed the factors that could be considered in determining fair value
in an appraisal proceeding, stating that "proof of value by any techniques or
methods which are generally considered acceptable in the financial community and
otherwise admissible in court" should be considered and that "[f]air" price
obviously requires consideration of all relevant factors involving the value of
a company. The Delaware Supreme Court has stated that, in making this
determination of fair value, the court must consider market value, asset value,
dividends, earnings prospects, the nature of the enterprise and any other
factors which could be ascertained as of the date of the merger and which "throw
any light on future prospects of the merged corporation." The Delaware Supreme
Court noted that Section 262 provides that fair value is to be determined
"exclusive of any element of value arising from the accomplishment or
expectation of the merger." In Cede & Co. v. Technicolor, Inc., the Delaware
Supreme Court stated that such exclusion is a "narrow exclusion [that] does not
encompass known elements of value" but which rather applies only to the
speculative elements of value arising from such accomplishment or expectation.
In Weinberger, the Delaware Supreme Court held that "elements of future value,
including the nature of the enterprises, which are known or susceptible of proof
as of the date of the merger and not the product of speculation, may be
considered."

         York stockholders considering seeking appraisal should have in mind
that the fair value of their shares determined by the Delaware Court under
Section 262 could be more than, the same as, or less than the consideration
payable pursuant to the merger agreement. Moreover, the surviving corporation
does not anticipate offering more than the consideration payable pursuant to the
merger agreement to any Dissenting Stockholder and reserves the right to assert
in any appraisal proceedings, that, for purposes of Section 262, the "fair
value" of a share of common stock of York is less than the consideration payable
pursuant to the merger agreement.

         The Delaware Court may also (1) determine a fair rate of interest, if
any, to be paid to Dissenting Stockholders in addition to the fair value of the
shares, (2) determine the costs of the proceeding and tax such costs against the
parties as the Delaware Court deems equitable (however, costs do not include
attorneys' and expert

                                   -27-

witnesses' fees) and (3) upon application of a Dissenting Stockholder, order
all or a portion of the expenses incurred by any Dissenting Stockholder in
connection with the appraisal proceeding, including without limitation
reasonable attorneys' fees and fees and expenses of experts, to be charged
pro rata against the value of all shares entitled to appraisal.

         No appraisal proceedings in the Delaware court will be dismissed as to
any Dissenting Stockholder without the approval of the Delaware court, and this
approval may be conditioned upon terms which the Delaware Court deems just.

         From and after the effective time of the merger, Dissenting
Stockholders will not be entitled to vote any shares of common stock of York
subject to demand for appraisal for any purpose (or consent by written action)
and will not be entitled to receive payment of dividends or other distributions
in respect of such shares, except for dividends or other distributions payable
to York stockholders of record at a date prior to the effective time of the
merger.

         Failure to take any required step in connection with appraisal rights
may result in the loss of such rights. Any York stockholder who loses such
rights will only be entitled to receive the merger consideration.

                                   -28-

                              THE MERGER AGREEMENT

         The following description of the material provisions of the merger
agreement is qualified in its entirety by reference to the complete text of the
merger agreement, a copy of which is attached as Annex A to this Proxy
Statement, and is incorporated herein by this reference. You are urged to review
the merger agreement in its entirety carefully.

GENERAL

         At the effective time of the merger, Empire will merge into York,
Empire will cease to exist, and York will survive the merger as a subsidiary of
Matthews. The surviving corporation will continue to be governed by Delaware
law. The certificate of incorporation and bylaws of Empire will be the initial
certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the surviving corporation. The
certificate of incorporation of the surviving corporation will be amended so
that the name of the surviving corporation will be "The York Group, Inc." The
directors and officers of Empire immediately prior to the effective time of the
merger will be the initial directors and officers of the surviving corporation.

MERGER CONSIDERATION

         At the effective time of the merger, each share of common stock of York
and all other shares of capital stock of York that are owned by York or any
subsidiary of York or by Matthews or any wholly-owned subsidiary or affiliate of
Matthews will be canceled and retired and will cease to exist, and no
consideration will be paid for any such shares. All other issued and outstanding
shares of common stock of York, except for shares held by stockholders who
properly perfect their appraisal rights under Delaware law, will be converted
into the right to receive (1) $10.00 in cash, without interest, plus (2) the
Excess Cash Increment (as defined above under "The Merger -- Effects of the
Merger; Merger Consideration"). The merger agreement provides that the merger
consideration will not be less than $10.00 nor more than $11.00.

         At the effective time of the merger, all stockholders of York, except
for stockholders who properly perfect their appraisal rights under Delaware law,
will cease to have any rights with respect to their shares of common stock other
than the right to receive the merger consideration in accordance with the terms
of the merger agreement. York stockholders who properly perfect their appraisal
rights will be entitled to a judicial determination of the fair value of their
shares of common stock of York and will receive from the surviving corporation
payment of such fair value in cash, together with a fair rate of interest, if
any, as determined by the court. York stockholders who properly perfect their
appraisal rights will not be entitled to any portion of the merger
consideration. However, shares held by stockholders who fail to perfect, or who
otherwise effectively withdraw or lose, their appraisal rights under Delaware
law will be treated as though they had been converted as of the effective date
of the merger into the right to receive the merger consideration. See "The
Merger -- Appraisal Rights under Delaware Law."

         At the effective time of the merger, each share of common stock of
Empire issued and outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the
merger will be converted into one share of common stock of the surviving
corporation.

TREATMENT OF STOCK OPTIONS

         Immediately prior to the completion of the merger, York will settle,
cash out or cause to be cancelled all York Stock Options and any shares of
Deferred Stock pursuant to the Director Deferral Plan, such that all York Stock
Options and rights to Deferred Stock are terminated prior to the completion of
the merger. Option holders will be given written notice that York will cash out
all options that are "in the money" as of closing. The value of the stock
options will be based on a predetermined formula that will equate the options,
on a per share basis, to the calculated value of an outstanding share at the
time of closing.

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES

         The merger agreement contains customary representations and warranties
by York, Matthews, and Empire relating to, among other things, capital
structure, business, as well as to the amendment by York of the York Rights
Agreement to make the rights thereunder inapplicable to the merger agreement and
the merger, and the immediate availability of funds to Matthews for payment of
the merger consideration.

                                   -29-

COVENANTS

merger, York will carry on its business in the ordinary course consistent with

Matthews. During that time York will also use reasonable efforts to preserve
intact its business organizations and relations with third parties and keep
available the services of its present officers and employees. The merger
agreement provides that, prior to the effective time of the merger, neither York
nor any of its subsidiaries will, among other things (with limited exceptions):

                  capital stock or, except in the ordinary course of business

                  consistent with past practice, and any other acquisitions for
                  consideration that is, in the aggregate, in excess of
                  $200,000;

         o        incur any indebtedness for borrowed money or guarantee such
                  indebtedness of another person, or issue or sell any debt
                  securities or warrants or other rights to acquire any debt
                  security of York or any of its subsidiaries;

         o        terminate, cancel, waive any rights under or request any

                  agreement material to the business, results of operations or

                  course of business and consistent with past practice;

                  inconsistent with elections made, positions taken or methods

                  termination, severance or other plan, agreement, trust, fund,
                  policy or arrangement for the benefit of any

                                   -30-

                  director, officer or employee, or increase the benefits

                  policies or employment or other agreements;

         o        take any action that, individually or in the aggregate, makes
                  any representation and warranty of York under the merger
                  agreement untrue in any material respect at, or as of any time
                  prior to, the effective time of the merger; or

         o        agree or commit to do any of the foregoing.

NO SOLICITATION

         The merger agreement provides that York will not, through any of its
subsidiaries, officers, directors or employees or investment bankers, attorneys,
accountants, agents or other advisors or representatives:

         o        solicit, initiate or knowingly encourage the submission of any
                  proposals that would constitute a takeover proposal;

         o        enter into any agreement with respect to a takeover proposal;
                  or

         o        participate in any discussions or negotiations regarding, or
                  furnish to any person any information with respect to, or take
                  any other action to facilitate any inquiries or the making of
                  any proposal that constitutes, or may reasonably be expected
                  to lead to, any takeover proposal;

provided, however, that to the extent required by the fiduciary obligations of
the York board of directors, York may, in response to unsolicited requests
therefor, participate in discussions or negotiations with, and furnish
information pursuant to a confidentiality agreement to, any person who indicates
a willingness to make a takeover proposal that would constitute a "superior
proposal."

         A proposal will constitute a "takeover proposal" if it is a proposal
for a merger, consolidation, share exchange, business combination or other
similar transaction involving York or any of its significant subsidiaries, or
any proposal or offer to acquire, directly or indirectly, an equity interest in
at least 15% of the voting securities of, or a substantial portion of the assets
of, York or any of its significant subsidiaries, other than the transactions
contemplated by the merger agreement. A takeover proposal will constitute a
"superior proposal" if it is a bona fide written proposal made by a third party
to acquire all of the outstanding equity interests in or substantially all of
the assets of York pursuant to a tender or exchange offer, a merger, a share
exchange, a sale of all or substantially all its assets on terms which a
majority of the members of the York board of directors determines in good faith
(taking into account the advice of independent financial advisors) to be more
favorable to York and its stockholders than the merger.

         The merger agreement also provides that neither the York board of
directors nor any committee thereof may withdraw or modify, or propose to
withdraw or modify, in a manner adverse to Matthews, the approval or
recommendation by the York board of directors or any such committee of the
merger agreement or the merger, or approve or recommend, or propose to approve
or recommend, any takeover proposal. However, the York board of directors, to
the extent required by its fiduciary obligations, may approve or recommend a
superior proposal or withdraw or modify its approval or recommendation of the
merger agreement or the merger and nothing contained in the merger agreement
will prevent the York board of directors from complying with certain rules
applicable to a takeover proposal.

         The merger agreement requires York to notify Matthews promptly after
receipt by York of any takeover proposal or any request for nonpublic
information in connection with a takeover proposal or for access to the
properties, books or records of York by any person or entity that informs York
that it is considering making, or has made, a takeover proposal.

ADDITIONAL AGREEMENTS

         STOCKHOLDERS MEETING AND PROXY STATEMENT. York has agreed to duly call,
give notice of, convene and hold a special meeting of its stockholders to vote
on the adoption of the merger agreement and to use its commercially reasonable
efforts to solicit proxies from its stockholders in favor of the adoption of the
merger agreement.

                                   -31-

         ACCESS TO INFORMATION. York has agreed to afford to the officers,
employees, accountants, counsel and other representatives of Matthews access,
during the period prior to the effective time of the merger, to all its
properties, books, contracts, commitments and records. The parties will hold any
such information in confidence in accordance with a confidentiality agreement
dated as of January 16, 2001 between York and Matthews.

         APPROPRIATE ACTION; CONSENTS; FILINGS. York and Matthews have agreed to
use their reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions,
and do, or cause to be done, all things, necessary, proper or advisable under
applicable laws to complete the merger and the other transactions contemplated
by the merger agreement as promptly as practicable; obtain from any governmental
entity any consents, licenses, permits, waivers, approvals, authorizations or
orders required to be obtained or made by York and Matthews or any of their
subsidiaries, or to avoid any action or proceeding by any governmental entity,
in connection with the authorization, execution and delivery of the merger
agreement and the consummation of the merger; and make all necessary filings and
other required submissions with respect to the merger agreement and the merger
required under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934, as amended, and any other applicable law. Matthews and York have
also agreed to use their reasonable best efforts to resolve such objections, if
any, as may be asserted by any governmental entity with respect to the
transactions contemplated by the merger agreement under the HSR Act, the Sherman
Act (as amended), the Clayton Act (as amended), the Federal Trade Commission Act
(as amended), and any other federal, state or foreign statutes, rules,
regulations, orders or decrees that are designed to prohibit, restrict or
regulate actions having the purpose or effect of monopolization or restraint of
trade.

         PUBLIC DISCLOSURE. York and Matthews have agreed to consult with each
other before issuing any press release or otherwise making any public statement
about the merger or the merger agreement and will not issue any press release or
make any public statement without the prior consent of the other party, which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed.

         INDEMNIFICATION OF DIRECTORS AND OFFICERS; INSURANCE. After the
effective time of the merger, Matthews and the surviving corporation have agreed
to indemnify, hold harmless, and defend each and every present and former
director, officer, employee, fiduciary, and agent of York and each subsidiary of
York from and against all attorneys' fees, judgments, fines, losses, claims,
damages, liabilities, settlement amounts, costs and expenses in connection with
any claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation arising out of or
pertaining to any action or omission in their capacity as an officer, director,
employee, fiduciary or agent (including the transactions contemplated by the
merger agreement).

         In addition, for a period of six years from the effective time of the
merger, the surviving corporation and Matthews will provide to the indemnified
parties liability insurance protection substantially equivalent in kind and
scope as that provided by York's current directors' and officers' liability
insurance policies

         YORK RIGHTS AGREEMENT. York has agreed that it has taken and will
continue to take all necessary action to ensure that none of the transactions
contemplated in the merger agreement will cause Matthews, Empire or any of
Matthews' affiliates or associates to become an Acquiring Person under the York
Rights Agreement or otherwise affect in any way the rights under the York Rights
Agreement, including causing such rights to separate from the underlying shares
or by giving such holders the rights to acquire securities of any party hereto.

         EMPLOYEES. For at least two (2) years following the completion of the
merger, Matthews agrees to provide employee benefits to the employees of York
and its subsidiaries which are in the aggregate no less favorable than such
benefits that were provided by York and the subsidiaries as of the effective
date of the merger.

FEES AND EXPENSES

         Except as described below and under "The Merger -- Termination,
Termination Fees, Amendment and Waiver," whether or not the merger is completed,
all fees and expenses incurred in connection with the merger, the merger
agreement and the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement will be paid
by the party incurring the fees or expenses.

         York and Matthews will share equally all fees and expenses, other than
attorneys' and accounting fees and expenses, incurred in relation to the
printing and filing of this Proxy Statement.

         o        the merger has not been consummated by December 31, 2001,

                  the merger;

         (3)      the merger agreement is terminated by Matthews because the

                           PROXY SOLICITATION EXPENSES

         York will bear the cost of soliciting proxies for the Special Meeting.
In addition to the use of the mails, proxies may be solicited by officers,
directors, and regular employees, personally or by telephone. York will
reimburse banks, brokers, and other nominees for any out-of-pocket expenses
incurred by them in sending proxy materials to the beneficial owners of York's
common stock. If follow-up requests for proxies are necessary, York may employ
other persons to make these requests.

                                  OTHER MATTERS

         The York board of directors does not know of any other matters to come
before the Special Meeting. However, if any other matters properly come before
the Special Meeting, the persons named in the accompanying proxy card intend to
vote the proxy in accordance with their judgment on such matters.

                          AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER

                  THIS AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER is entered into as of
May 24, 2001 (this "AGREEMENT") by and among MATTHEWS INTERNATIONAL
CORPORATION, a Pennsylvania corporation ("MATTHEWS"), EMPIRE MERGER CORP., a
Delaware corporation and a wholly-owned subsidiary of Matthews ("MERGER
SUB"), and THE YORK GROUP, INC., a Delaware corporation ("YORK") (Matthews,
Merger Sub and York being hereinafter collectively referred to as the
"CONSTITUENT CORPORATIONS").

                              W I T N E S S E T H:

                  WHEREAS, the respective Boards of Directors of Matthews,
Merger Sub and York have approved and declared advisable the merger of Merger
Sub with and into York (the "MERGER"), upon the terms and conditions set forth
herein, whereby each issued and outstanding share of Common Stock of York, par
value $.01 per share (the "YORK COMMON STOCK"), together with any associated
York preferred stock purchase rights ("YORK RIGHTS"), not owned directly or
indirectly by Matthews will be converted into an amount in cash; and

                  WHEREAS, the respective Boards of Directors of Matthews and
York have determined that the Merger is in furtherance of and consistent with
their respective long-term business strategies and is in the best interests of
their respective stockholders;

                  NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises,
representations, warranties and agreements herein contained, the parties agree
as follows:

                                    ARTICLE I
                                   THE MERGER

                  Section 1.1. THE MERGER. Upon the terms and subject to the
conditions hereof, and in accordance with the General Corporation Law of the
State of Delaware (the "DGCL"), Merger Sub shall be merged with and into York at
the Effective Time (as defined in SECTION 1.2). Following the Merger, the
separate corporate existence of Merger Sub shall cease and York shall continue
as the surviving corporation (the "SURVIVING CORPORATION") and shall succeed to
and assume all the rights and obligations of Merger Sub in accordance with the
DGCL and shall continue under the name The York Group, Inc.

                  Section 1.2. EFFECTIVE TIME. Concurrently with the Closing (as
defined in SECTION 1.13), Matthews, Merger Sub and York will cause a Certificate
of Merger (the "CERTIFICATE OF MERGER"), executed in accordance with the
relevant provisions of the DGCL, to be filed with the Secretary of State of
Delaware. The Merger shall become effective on the date and at the time when the
Certificate of Merger has been duly filed with the Secretary of State of
Delaware (the "EFFECTIVE TIME").

                  Section 1.3. EFFECTS OF THE MERGER. The Merger shall have the
effects set forth in Section 259 of the DGCL.

                  Section 1.4. CHARTER AND BY-LAWS; BOARD OF DIRECTORS;
MANAGEMENT SUCCESSION.

                  (a) At the Effective Time, the Certificate of Incorporation of
Merger Sub as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the
Certificate of Incorporation of the Surviving Corporation until changed or
amended as provided therein or by applicable law; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that at the
Effective

Time, the Certificate of Incorporation shall be amended so that the name of
the Surviving Corporation shall be "The York Group, Inc." At the Effective
Time, the By-Laws of Merger Sub, as in effect immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall be the By-Laws of the Surviving Corporation until
changed or amended as provided therein or by applicable law.

                  (b) From and after the Effective Time, until duly changed in
compliance with applicable law and the certificate of incorporation and by-laws
of the Surviving Corporation, the board of directors of the Surviving
Corporation shall consist of the board of directors of Merger Sub immediately
prior to the Effective Time.

                  (c) From and after the Effective Time, the officers of the
Surviving Corporation shall be the officers of Merger Sub immediately prior to
the Effective Time, until their respective successors are duly elected or
appointed and qualified in accordance with applicable law.

                  Section 1.5. CONVERSION OF SECURITIES. As of the Effective
Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of Matthews,
Merger Sub, York or the holders of any securities of the Constituent
Corporations:

                  (a) All shares of York Common Stock, together with any
associated York Rights, that are held in the treasury of York or by any
wholly-owned Subsidiary of York and any shares of York Common Stock, together
with any associated York Rights, owned by Matthews or by any wholly-owned
Subsidiary or Affiliate of Matthews shall be cancelled and no capital stock of
Matthews or other consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor.

                  (b) Each share of common stock, par value $.01 per share, of
Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall
be converted into one share of common stock, par value $.01 per share, of the
Surviving Corporation with the same rights, powers and privileges as the shares
so converted and shall constitute the only outstanding shares of capital stock
of the Surviving Corporation.

                  (c)      (i) Each share of York Common Stock, together with
         any associated York Rights, issued and outstanding immediately prior to
         the Effective Time (other than shares of York Common Stock referred to
         in SECTION 1.5(a) hereof and Appraisal Shares as defined in
         SECTION 1.5(e)), shall, by virtue of the Merger and without any action
         on the part of the holder thereof, be converted into an amount in cash,
         per share of York Common Stock held, together with any associated York
         Rights, as determined in SECTION 1.5(c)(ii) below.

                           (ii) The calculation of the amount of cash to be paid
         to the holders of York Common Stock for each share of York Common Stock
         together with any associated York Rights shall be (x) $10 per share of
         York Common Stock together with any associated York Rights, plus (y)
         the Excess Cash Increment (such per share calculation being herein
         referred to as the "YORK EQUITY VALUE"); PROVIDED, HOWEVER, (i) for the
         avoidance of doubt, the York Equity Value shall not be less than $10
         per share of York Common Stock together with any associated York Rights
         and (ii) that if York's EBITDA (as defined below) for the nine months
         ended September 30, 2001 does not at least equal $9.0 million (the
         "THRESHOLD EBITDA"), then Matthews shall be permitted to terminate this
         Agreement in accordance with SECTION 7.1(j) hereof. Notwithstanding the
         foregoing, Matthews shall not be required to pay more than $11 per
         share of York Common Stock.

                                     -2-

                           (iii)    (A)     As used herein,

         Excess Cash Increment = A - ($6.9 million + B + C + D + E + F + G) + (H + I)
                                 ----------------------------------------------------
                                            Outstanding Shares

         Excess Cash Increment shall not be less than zero.

         "A" is "YORK CASH." "YORK CASH" shall mean the total cash and Cash
Equivalents of York and its Subsidiaries at October 31, 2001, plus the Selected
Property Value. "CASH EQUIVALENTS" shall mean all highly liquid investments of
York purchased with original maturities of three months or less. "SELECTED
PROPERTY VALUE" shall mean (i) 50% of the aggregate Appraised Value on the
following properties of York not sold nor subject to a Pending Contract to sell
by York on or before October 31, 2001: Aiken, South Carolina; Portland, Oregon;
Lawrenceville, Georgia; Richmond, Indiana (at 111 N. W. "T" Street) and New
Orleans, Louisiana (the "SELECTED PROPERTIES"), plus (ii) the agreed upon
purchase price for any or all of the Selected Properties that are subject to a
Pending Contract for sale. "APPRAISED VALUE" shall mean the fair market value of
such properties held for sale, determined as soon as practicable after the date
hereof, but in no event determined later than October 31, 2001, by a certified
real estate appraisal firm selected by Matthews, using appraisal criteria
determined by the appraisal firm and reasonably acceptable to Matthews and York,
including consideration of environmental issues with respect to such properties,
and "PENDING CONTRACT" shall mean a standard contract for sale of real estate in
the applicable jurisdiction with respect to which the contingency period has
expired or which does not contain a contingency period of more than 60 days.

         "B" is "PRESENT VALUE ENVIRONMENTAL REMEDIATION COSTS." "PRESENT VALUE
ENVIRONMENTAL REMEDIATION COSTS" shall mean the present value cost (discounted
at 7.5%) of the Environmental Remediation Costs which are not paid on or before
October 31, 2001. "ENVIRONMENTAL REMEDIATION COSTS" shall mean the estimated
remediation costs to meet applicable environmental clean-up requirements and to
conduct any ongoing environmental monitoring and maintenance activities for the
following locations: Anniston, Alabama, West Point, Mississippi and Lynn,
Indiana, with such costs to be determined as follows:

     (1) York shall, at York's expense, engage an environmental consulting
         company to perform a limited Phase II subsurface environmental
         investigation of the three sites consistent with a scope of work, which
         was proposed by Matthews and approved by York before the date of this
         Agreement ("LIMITED PHASE II INVESTIGATION"). York and Matthews have
         preapproved RMT, Inc. ("RMT") to perform the Limited Phase II
         Investigation. RMT or, if both York and Matthews approve, another
         environmental consulting company ("CONTRACTOR"), shall be instructed to
         perform its work so as to reach a probable-cost estimate or a range of
         estimates in accordance with (i) the provisions herein and (ii) the
         scope of work, including specifically to produce a range of estimates
         (if necessary) with a confidence range of plus or minus $1 million as
         provided for in subsection (4) below. York will allow Matthews or its
         representatives to observe the Limited Phase II Investigation at all
         three sites and shall provide Matthews with copies of all field notes,
         boring logs and analytical data within a reasonable time after receipt
         and prior to the preparation of the Phase II Report. York shall
         authorize Contractor to discuss its work with Matthews or its
         representatives if York's representatives participate in such
         discussions.

     (2) York shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Limited
         Phase II Investigation to be completed, and a report regarding the same
         to be issued, on or before July 15, 2001 ("Phase II Report"). The Phase
         II Report will contain recommendations for additional investigation
         and/or

                                     -3-

         remediation, if appropriate. York will consider, in good faith,
         reasonable comments by Matthews or its representatives on the draft
         Phase II Report before finalizing.

     (3) Based upon the Limited Phase II Investigation, the Phase II Report
         shall include a probable-cost estimate (on a facility specific basis)
         of costs to conduct remediation activities necessary (if any) to
         address the presence of contaminants in soil and/or groundwater at each
         of the facilities in concentrations greater than permitted for
         commercial/industrial property under applicable Environmental Laws, as
         revealed by the Limited Phase II Investigation. The probable-cost
         estimate shall be based upon the lowest cost methods for investigation,
         remediation, removal, corrective action, containment and/or monitoring
         permitted by applicable Environmental Laws and to minimize liability
         under Environmental Laws. It is understood that any required corrective
         action may include the use of risk-based remedies (including without
         limitation natural attenuation remedies), institutional and/or
         engineering controls or deed restrictions, if such remedies or controls
         have been approved or accepted by the relevant state agency in similar
         situations and provided that such remedies or controls do not
         unreasonably restrict or interfere with the current use of the
         facility. It is further understood that the probable-cost estimate
         shall include all investigation, remediation, removal, corrective
         action, containment and/or monitoring requirements of applicable state
         or federal environmental agencies.

     (4) If Contractor's probable-cost estimate for any of the three facilities
         cannot be refined to an estimate with a confidence range of plus or
         minus $1 million (e.g. $1-3 million) after the Limited Phase II
         Investigation, then York and Matthews will cooperate with Contractor to
         approve such additional investigation by Contractor at any of the three
         facilities as will facilitate the refinement of the probable-cost
         estimate to an estimate with a confidence range of plus or minus $1
         million. Such additional investigation shall be at York's expense and
         shall be completed on or before August 31, 2001 or such later date as
         the parties may agree upon; provided that a final characterization
         report and probable-cost estimate with a confidence range of plus or
         minus $1 million must be delivered by Contractor to York and Matthews
         no later than September 30, 2001. York will allow Matthews or its
         representatives to observe any additional investigation and shall
         provide Matthews with copies of all field notes, boring logs and
         analytical data within a reasonable time after receipt and prior to the
         preparation of the final characterization report. York shall authorize
         contractor to discuss its work with Matthews or its representatives if
         York's representatives participate in such discussions. Subject to
         Subsection (5), Environmental Remediation Costs for any given facility
         shall be the midpoint of any probable cost estimate range for such
         facility that meets the requirements of this Subsection (4) (e.g. with
         a $1-3 million range, midpoint would be $2 million). Environmental
         Remediation Costs for all three facilities shall be the aggregate
         midpoints of such ranges, which meet the requirements of this
         subsection (4).

     (5) If the midpoint of the probable-cost estimate for any one facility is
         equal to or less than $100,000, then the Environmental Remediation Cost
         for such facility shall be deemed to be zero. Without giving effect to
         the preceding sentence, if the aggregate midpoints of the probable-cost
         estimates for all three facilities, in the aggregate, is less than or
         equal to $300,000, then the Environmental Remediation Cost for all
         three facilities shall be deemed to be zero.

If as a result of the Limited Phase II Investigation, York must commence
remediation activities before the Closing Date to comply with applicable
Environmental Laws, York and Matthews agree to reasonably cooperate with respect
to such activities, and Matthews will identify the name and contact information
for a person representing Matthews who will coordinate with York, and if
desired, provide comment regarding the scope, timing, and performance of such
activities.

         "C" is the premium not paid on or before October 31, 2001 for cost cap
coverage from AIG or a similarly rated insurance company for each facility
having a probable-cost estimate exceeding $100,000 so that the parties may
protect against actual costs of remediation at such facility exceeding the
amount of the Environmental Remediation Costs applicable to such facility. In
determining the Insurance Premium, the policy shall have (a) a self-insured
retention/deductible equal to the Environmental Remediation Costs for each
facility having a probable-cost estimate exceeding $100,000, (b) limits of
liability equal to 100% of the Environmental Remediation Costs for each facility
having a probable-cost estimate exceeding $100,000, and (c) a policy term of 10
years, unless a shorter or longer remediation period is applicable, in which
case the term shall not be shorter than the projected remediation period. If
cost cap coverage meeting the specifications set forth herein cannot be bound by
York despite York's commercially reasonable efforts to do so on or before
October 31, 2001 (it being understood that York shall have no obligation to
purchase such insurance if the premium exceeds 25% of the Environmental
Remediation Costs), then cost cap coverage need not be procured and for purposes
of the Excess Cash Increment calculation, the premium shall be deemed to be 25%
of the Environmental Remediation Costs with respect to such facilities for which
such cost cap coverage has not been obtained.

         "D" is the legal, accounting, environmental consulting and investment
banking fees and expenses incurred or accrued by York and its Subsidiaries on or

prior to the Closing.

         "E" is the costs of settling, cashing out or causing to be cancelled

defined in Section 1.5(d)) or York's Non-Qualified Deferred Compensation Plan).

         "F" is the amount by which Adjusted Working Capital is greater that
$13.2 million or less than $10.2 million on October 31, 2001. If Adjusted
Working Capital as of October 31, 2001 is greater than $13.2 million, the excess
amount shall be a negative number and have the effect of increasing the Excess
Cash Increment, but if the Adjusted Working Capital as of October 31, 2001 is
less than $10.2 million, the deficiency shall be a positive number and have the
effect of decreasing the Excess Cash Increment. "ADJUSTED WORKING CAPITAL" shall
mean the difference between (a) the sum of (1) trade accounts and notes
receivable (net of allowance for doubtful accounts), (2) inventory, (3) pre-paid
expenses, (4) deferred tax amount, (5) income tax receivable, (6) assets held
for sale, (7) other current assets, (8) any amounts which are reflected in
Adjusted Working Capital and are being deducted from the Excess Cash Increment

which has not been paid due to the Basket Amount provided for in Section
5.03(b)(ii) of the Stock Purchase Agreement or the Asset Purchase Agreement (as
such agreements are defined herein) or for any other reason and (b) the sum of
(1) accounts payable, (2) accrued expenses and (3) other current liabilities,
and specifically excluding any calculation of cash, Cash Equivalents or Funded
Indebtedness, all determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles ("GAAP") applied consistently with the audited financial statements
(the "FINANCIAL STATEMENTS") of York as of December 31, 2000. The foregoing
notwithstanding, Adjusted Working Capital shall not be reduced by any decreases
in York's assets, liabilities or financial position resultant from or arising
out of claims for indemnification under the Purchase Agreements.

         "G" is all funded indebtedness, and any capitalized lease obligations
first incurred after the date of this Agreement, of York and its Subsidiaries
("Funded Indebtedness") on October 31, 2001.

         "H" is any cash paid for severance, retention, transition or
integration costs to the extent that York and Matthews agree to the same in a

Purchase Agreement dated concurrently herewith among Matthews, Empire Stock
Corp., York, York Bronze Company and OMC Industries, Inc. (the "ASSET PURCHASE
AGREEMENT"), the Stock Purchase Agreement by and between Matthews, Empire Stock

any other document related thereto (together with the Stock Purchase Agreement
and the Asset Purchase Agreement, the "PURCHASE AGREEMENTS"), but which has not
been paid due to the Basket Amount provided for in Section 5.03(b)(ii) of the
Stock Purchase Agreement or the Asset Purchase Agreement or for any other
reason.

           "Outstanding Shares" shall mean the total number of shares of York
Common Stock outstanding on October 31, 2001.

           Neither York Cash nor Excess Cash Increment will be reduced by any
decreases in York's Cash or Cash Equivalents resulting from or arising out of
claims for indemnification under the Purchase Agreements. For the avoidance of
doubt, York has not agreed at this time and is not obligated under this
Agreement or any of the Purchase Agreements to pay any transition or integration
costs.

                  (B) As used herein, "EBITDA" shall mean the York net income
         for the nine months ended September 30, 2001 as shown in the Financial

         Report, (i) plus interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization for
         such nine month period as shown in such Financial Statements of York,
         (ii) plus any Unusual Charges for such nine month period (as defined

         accounting, investment banking, proxy solicitation, printing and other
         fees, costs, expenses and charges incurred in evaluating and responding
         to the proposals, offers and communications of stockholders and other
         potential strategic or financial partners, acquirors or investors plus
         those incurred in conjunction with York's credit facilities and
         refinancing efforts, (y) any transition, integration, consolidation,

         nature (whether or not related to this Agreement or closing the Merger,
         such as plant closing expenses or environmental costs of a non
         recurring nature) accruing during 2001 (and determined in accordance
         with GAAP). For avoidance of doubt with respect to subsection (y) of
         the immediately preceding sentence, York has not agreed at this time
         and is not obligated under this Agreement or any of the Purchase
         Agreements to pay any transition, integration and consolidation fees,
         costs and expenses. As used herein, "NON-RECURRING GAINS" shall mean
         any gain (or loss) on the sale or other disposition, except for any

         in York's assets, liabilities or financial position resultant from or
         arising out of claims for indemnification under the Purchase
         Agreements.

         2001 (but in no event later than November 12, 2001), York will deliver
         to Matthews a statement of EBITDA as of September 30, 2001 (the "EBITDA

         prepared in accordance with GAAP, applied consistently with the
         Financial Statements of York as of December 31, 2000, and subjected to
         the Agreed-Upon Procedures to be performed by Arthur Andersen LLP.

                  As promptly as practicable after October 31, 2001 (but in no
         event later than November 19, 2001), York will deliver to Matthews a
         Statement of Adjusted Working Capital as of October 31, 2001 (the
         "October Adjusted Working Capital Statement and together with the
         September Adjusted Working Capital Statement, the "Adjusted Working
         Capital Statements"). Such October Adjusted Working Capital Statement
         will be prepared on a basis consistent in all material respects with
         the September Adjusted Working Capital Statement. Matthews shall cause
         such October Adjusted Working Capital Statement to be reviewed by
         PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP prior to November 27, 2001.

         assumptions and determinations used to calculate EBITDA and Adjusted
         Working Capital which are described as Exhibit 1.5(y) hereto to be used

         Statements and the EBITDA Statement.

                           (v) If Matthews objects to the Adjusted Working
         Capital Statements or the EBITDA Statement by November 27, 2001, and
         Matthews and York are unable to resolve such objections by November 30,
         2001, then all disagreements will be submitted for resolution to Arthur
         Andersen LLP (the "INDEPENDENT AUDITOR"). The Independent Auditor will
         have up to 10 days after its appointment to resolve the disputes
         submitted to it. The Adjusted Working Capital Statements and the EBITDA
         Statement, either as agreed to by Matthews and York or as adjusted by
         the Independent Auditor pursuant to the preceding sentence, will be
         final and binding. The fees and expenses of the Independent Auditor
         will be shared equally by Matthews and York.

                  (d) Immediately prior to the Effective Time, York shall
settle, cash out or cause to be cancelled all York Stock Options (as defined in
Section 2.2(a)) and any shares of Common Stock which have been deferred
("Deferred Stock") pursuant to the York Non-Employee Director Cash and Equity
Compensation Plan (the "Director Deferral Plan"), such that all York Stock
Options and rights to Deferred Stock are terminated prior to the Effective Time.
For the avoidance of doubt, Matthews shall not be required to pay for, as part
of the Merger Consideration, any Deferred Stock, and any York Stock Options
which are not vested and exercised prior to October 31, 2001.

                                     -7-

                  (e) Notwithstanding any portion of this Agreement to the
contrary, any shares of York Common Stock, together with any associated York
Rights, held by a holder who has demanded and perfected appraisal rights for
such shares permitted by and in accordance with the DGCL and who, as of the
Effective Time, has not effectively withdrawn or lost such appraisal rights
("APPRAISAL SHARES") shall not be converted into or represent a right to
receive, pursuant to SECTION 1.5(c), cash, but the holder thereof shall only be
entitled to receive such rights as granted by the DGCL.

                           (i) Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any holder of
         shares of York Common Stock, together with any associated York Rights,
         shall effectively withdraw or lose (through failure to perfect or
         otherwise) such holder's appraisal rights, then as of the later of (A)
         the Effective Time or (B) the occurrence of such event, such holder's
         shares, together with any associated York Rights, shall automatically
         be converted into and represent only the right to receive, as provided
         in SECTION 1.5(c), cash with no interest thereon upon surrender of the
         certificate formally representing such shares.

                           (ii) York will give Matthews prompt notice of its
         receipt of any written demands for purchase of any shares of York
         Common Stock, together with any associated York Rights, together with
         copies of such demands. York shall permit Matthews to participate in
         all negotiations and proceedings with respect to demands for purchase
         of any shares of York Common Stock, together with any associated York
         Rights, as may be demanded under the DGCL.

                  Section 1.6. MATTHEWS TO MAKE CONSIDERATION AVAILABLE. (a)
EXCHANGE OF CERTIFICATES. Matthews shall authorize First Chicago Trust Company
of New York (or such other person or persons as shall be reasonably acceptable
to Matthews and York) to act as the depository and exchange agent hereunder (the
"EXCHANGE AGENT"). Prior to the Effective Time, Matthews shall deposit with the
Exchange Agent, and in trust for the holders of shares of York Common Stock,
together with any associated York Rights, converted in the Merger, via wire
transfer in immediately available funds cash sufficient to make all payments as
required pursuant to Section 1.5(c) (the "EXCHANGE FUND"). The Exchange Agent
shall deliver the cash contemplated to be issued pursuant to SECTION 1.5(c) out
of the Exchange Fund.

                  (b) EXCHANGE PROCEDURES. As soon as practicable after the
Effective Time, the Exchange Agent shall mail to each record holder of a
certificate or certificates which immediately prior to the Effective Time
represented outstanding shares of York Common Stock converted in the Merger (the
"CERTIFICATES") a letter of transmittal, which shall specify that delivery shall
be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only
upon actual delivery of the Certificates to the Exchange Agent, and shall
contain instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates in
exchange for cash, pursuant to SECTION 1.5(c). Upon surrender for cancellation
to the Exchange Agent of all Certificates held by any record holder of a
Certificate, together with such letter of transmittal, duly executed, the holder
of such Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor cash,
pursuant to SECTION 1.5(c), and any Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith
be cancelled.

                  Section 1.7. TRANSFER TAXES; WITHHOLDING. If any cash is to be
paid to a name other than that in which the Certificate surrendered in exchange
therefor is registered, it shall be a condition of such exchange that the
Certificate so surrendered shall be properly endorsed and otherwise in proper
form for transfer and that the person requesting such exchange shall pay to the
Exchange Agent any transfers or other taxes required, or shall establish to the
satisfaction of the Exchange Agent that such tax has been paid or is not
applicable. Matthews or the Exchange Agent shall be entitled to deduct and
withhold from the consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement
such amounts as Matthews or the Exchange Agent is required to deduct and
withhold with respect to the making of any such payment under the Internal
Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "CODE") or under any provision of state,
local or foreign tax law.

                                     -8-

To the extent that amounts are so withheld by Matthews or the Exchange Agent
and paid to the appropriate authority, such withheld amounts shall be treated
for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the person in
respect of which such deduction and withholding was made by Matthews or the
Exchange Agent.

                  Section 1.8. RETURN OF EXCHANGE FUND. Any portion of the
Exchange Fund which remains undistributed to the former stockholders of York for
one (1) year after the Effective Time shall be delivered to the Surviving
Corporation, upon demand of the Surviving Corporation, and any such former
stockholders who have not theretofore complied with this Article I shall
thereafter look only to Matthews and the Surviving Corporation for payment of
their claim for cash pursuant to SECTION 1.5(c). Neither Matthews, the Exchange
Agent nor the Surviving Corporation shall (absent manifest error) be liable to
any former holder of York Common Stock for any cash held in the Exchange Fund
which is delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned
property, escheat or similar law.

                  Section 1.9. NO FURTHER OWNERSHIP RIGHTS IN YORK COMMON STOCK.
All cash paid upon the surrender for exchange of Certificates in accordance with
the terms hereof shall be deemed to have been issued in full satisfaction of all
rights pertaining to the shares of York Common Stock, together with any
associated York Rights, represented by such Certificates.

                  Section 1.10. CLOSING OF YORK TRANSFER BOOKS. At the Effective
Time, the stock transfer books of York shall be closed and no transfer of shares
of York Common Stock, together with any associated York Rights, shall thereafter
be made on the records of York. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates are
presented to the Surviving Corporation, the Exchange Agent or Matthews, such
Certificates shall be cancelled and exchanged as provided in this ARTICLE I.

                  Section 1.11. LOST CERTIFICATES. If any Certificate shall have
been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by
the person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if
reasonably required by Matthews or the Exchange Agent, the posting by such
person of a bond, in such reasonable amount as Matthews or the Exchange Agent
may direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made against them with
respect to such Certificate, the Exchange Agent will issue in exchange for such
lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the cash pursuant to SECTION 1.5(c).

                  Section 1.12. FURTHER ASSURANCES. If at any time after the
Effective Time the Surviving Corporation shall consider or be advised that any
deeds, bills of sale, assignments or assurances or any other acts or things are
necessary, desirable or proper (a) to vest, perfect or confirm, of record or
otherwise, in the Surviving Corporation its right, title or interest in, to or
under any of the rights, privileges, powers, franchises, properties, permits,
licenses or assets of either of the Constituent Corporations, or (b) otherwise
to carry out the purposes of this Agreement, the Surviving Corporation and its
proper officers and directors or their designees shall be authorized to execute
and deliver, in the name and on behalf of either of the Constituent
Corporations, all such deeds, bills of sale, assignments and assurances and to
do, in the name and on behalf of either Constituent Corporation, all such other
acts and things as may be necessary, desirable or proper to vest, perfect or
confirm the Surviving Corporation's right, title or interest in, to or under any
of the rights, privileges, powers, franchises, properties or assets of such
Constituent Corporation and otherwise to carry out the purposes of this
Agreement.

                  Section 1.13. CLOSING. The closing of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement (the "CLOSING") and all actions specified in this
Agreement to occur at the Closing shall take place at the offices of Reed Smith
LLP, 435 Sixth Avenue, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, at 10:00 a.m., local time, no
later than the second business day following the day on which the last of the
conditions set forth in Article VI shall have been fulfilled or waived (if
permissible), which is expected to be on or about November 30, 2001, or at such

                                     -9-

other time and place as Matthews and York shall agree; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that
in no event shall the Closing take place prior to November 27, 2001 or later
than the End Date (as defined in SECTION 7.1(b)).

                                   ARTICLE II
                     REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF YORK

                  Except as disclosed in York's filings with the Securities and
Exchange Commission, the letter delivered to Matthews concurrently herewith and
designated therein as the York Disclosure Letter (the "YORK DISCLOSURE LETTER")
or the Disclosure Schedules to the Purchase Agreements, York hereby represents
and warrants to Matthews and Merger Sub as follows:

                  Section 2.1. CORPORATE ORGANIZATION. (a) York is a corporation
duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the
State of Delaware. York has the corporate power and authority to own or lease
all of its properties and assets and to carry on its business as it is now being
conducted, and is duly licensed or qualified to do business in each jurisdiction
in which the nature of the business conducted by it or the character or location
of the properties and assets owned or leased by it makes such licensing or
qualification necessary, except where the failure to be so licensed or qualified
would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on York. As
used in this Agreement, the term "MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT" means, with respect
to York or Matthews, as the case may be, a material adverse effect on (i) the
business, operations, results of operations or financial condition of such party
and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole, or (ii) the ability of such party to
consummate the transactions contemplated hereby, except to the extent resulting
from, related to or otherwise arising by virtue of (u) noncompliance with
Environmental Laws by York, its Subsidiaries or their Affiliates, agents or
predecessors, with the exception of an intentional misrepresentation of Section
2.15 which to York's knowledge would reasonably be expected to have a Material
Adverse Effect, (v) with respect to each party, the effect of any event,
occurrence, fact, condition, change, development or effect that is set forth in
this Agreement or in the York Disclosure Letter, (w) with respect to each party,
the effect of any other transaction or transactions with respect to which such
party or its Affiliates, prior to the date hereof, has announced (generally or
specifically) its intention to investigate, evaluate or consummate, (x) with
respect to York, the effect of the public announcement or pendency of the
transactions contemplated hereby on current customers or revenues of York or the

transaction or transactions among any of the parties hereto, among any of their
Affiliates, or among any party hereto and any Affiliate of a party hereto (each
a "CONSTITUENT AGREEMENT", (y) with respect to each party, any changes in
general, local, regional, state, United States or global economic or political
conditions or (z) with respect to each party, any changes affecting the industry
or industries generally in which such party operates. As used in this Agreement,
the word "SUBSIDIARY" means any corporation, partnership, limited liability
company, joint venture or other legal entity of which York or Matthews, as the
case may be (either alone or through or together with any other Subsidiary) (i)
owns, directly or indirectly, 50% or more of the stock or other equity interests
the holders of which are generally entitled to vote for the election of the
board of directors or other governing body of such corporation, partnership,
limited liability company, joint venture or other legal entity, (ii) is a
general partner, trustee or other entity or person performing similar functions,
or (iii) has control (as defined in Rule 405 under the Securities Act of 1933,
as amended (together with the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, the
"SECURITIES ACT")). True and complete copies of the Certificate of Incorporation
(the "YORK CERTIFICATE OF INCORPORATION") and by-laws of York (the "YORK
BY-LAWS"), as in effect as of the date of this Agreement, have previously been
made available by York to Matthews.

                  (b) Each York Subsidiary (i) is duly organized and validly
existing under the laws of its jurisdiction of organization, (ii) is duly
qualified to do business and in good standing in all jurisdictions (whether
federal, state, local or foreign) where its ownership or leasing of property or
the conduct of its business requires it to be so qualified and in which the
failure to be so qualified would reasonably be expected

                                    -10-

to have a Material Adverse Effect on York and (iii) has all requisite
corporate power and authority to own or lease its properties and assets and
to carry on its business as now conducted except as would not reasonably be
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on York.

                  (c) The minute books of each of York and the York Subsidiaries
accurately reflect in all material respects all material corporate actions held
or taken since January 1, 1998 of its respective stockholders and respective
boards of directors (including committees of the board of directors of York)
except as would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on
York.

                  Section 2.2. CAPITALIZATION. (a) As of December 31, 2000, the
authorized capital stock of York consists of (i) 25,000,000 shares of York

(including, in each case, any notes thereto) of York included in the York SEC
Documents complied as to form in all material respects with applicable
accounting requirements and the published rules and regulations of the SEC with

and fairly presented in all material respects the consolidated financial
position of York and its consolidated Subsidiaries as of the respective dates
thereof and the consolidated results of their operations and their consolidated
cash flows for the periods then ended (subject, in the case of unaudited
statements, to normal year-end audit adjustments and to any other adjustments
described therein). Except as disclosed in the York SEC Documents or as required
by GAAP, York has not, since December 1, 2000, made any material change in the
accounting practices or policies applied in the preparation of its financial

order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which
they are made, not misleading.

                  If at any time prior to the Effective Time any event with
respect to York, its officers and directors or any of its Subsidiaries shall
occur that is required to be described in the Proxy Statement, such event shall
be so described, and an appropriate supplement shall be promptly filed with the
SEC and, as required by law, disseminated to the stockholders of York. The Proxy
Statement will comply (with respect to York) as to form in all material respects
with the provisions of the Exchange Act.

                  Section 2.7. ABSENCE OF CERTAIN CHANGES OR EVENTS. Except as

                  Section 2.12. ERISA. (a) SECTION 2.12(a)(X) of the York
Disclosure Letter contains a list of each York Plan. With respect to each York
Plan, York has made available to Matthews a true and correct copy of (i) the
most recent annual report (Form 5500) filed with the IRS, (ii) such York Plan
and all amendments thereto, (iii) each trust agreement, insurance contract or
administration agreement relating to such York Plan, (iv) the most recent
summary plan description for each York Plan for which a summary plan description
is required, (v) the most recent actuarial report or valuation relating to a
York Plan subject to Title IV of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of
1974 and the regulations promulgated thereunder ("ERISA"), (vi) the most recent
determination letter, if any, issued by the IRS with respect to any York Plan
intended to be qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code, (vii) any request for
a determination currently pending before the IRS and (viii) all correspondence
with the IRS, the Department of Labor or the Pension Benefit Guaranty
Corporation relating to any outstanding controversy. Each York Plan complies
with ERISA, the Code and all other applicable statutes and governmental rules
and regulations, except any failure to comply as would not have, individually or
in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on York. Except as set forth in
SECTION 2.12(a)(Y) of the York Disclosure Letter, (i) no "reportable event"
(within the meaning of Section 4043 of ERISA) has occurred within the past three
years with respect to any York Plan which could result in liability to York,
(ii) neither York nor any of its ERISA Affiliates (as hereinafter defined) has
withdrawn from any York Multiemployer Plan (as hereinafter defined) at any time
or instituted, or is currently considering taking, any action to do so, and
(iii) no action has been taken, or is currently being considered, to terminate
any York Plan subject to Title IV of ERISA.

                                    -15-

                  (b) There has been no failure to make any contribution or pay
any amount due to any York Plan as required by Section 412 of the Code, Section
302 of ERISA, or the terms of any such Plan, and no York Plan, nor any trust
created thereunder, has incurred any "accumulated funding deficiency" (as
defined in Section 302 of ERISA), whether or not waived.

                  (c) With respect to York Plans, no event has occurred
and, to the Knowledge of York, there exists no condition or set of circumstances
in connection with which York or any of its ERISA Affiliates would be subject to
any liability under the terms of such York Plans, ERISA, the Code or any other
applicable law which has had, or would have, individually or in the aggregate, a
Material Adverse Effect on York. Except as listed on SECTION 2.12(c) of the York
Disclosure Letter, all York Plans that are intended to be qualified under
SECTION 401(a) of the Code have been determined by the IRS to be so qualified,
or a timely application for such determination is now pending or will be filed
on a timely basis and, except as listed on SECTION 2.12(c) of the York
Disclosure Letter, there is no reason why any York Plan is not so qualified in
operation. Neither York nor any of its ERISA Affiliates has been notified by any
York Multiemployer Plan that such York Multiemployer Plan is currently in
reorganization or insolvency under and within the meaning of Section 4241 or
4245 of ERISA or that such York Multiemployer Plan intends to terminate or has
been terminated under Section 4041A of ERISA. Neither the termination of any
York Multiemployer Plan nor the complete or partial withdrawal by YORK or any of
its ERISA Affiliates from any York Multiemployer Plan would result in any
liability of York or any of its ERISA Affiliates that would have, individually
or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on York. Except as set forth in
SECTION 2.12(c) of the York Disclosure Letter, neither York nor any of its ERISA
Affiliates has any liability or obligation under any welfare plan to provide
life insurance or medical benefits after termination of employment to any
employee or dependent other than as required by Part 6 of Title 1 of ERISA.

                  (d) As used in this Agreement, (i) "YORK PLAN" means a
"pension plan" (as defined in Section 3(2) of ERISA (other than a York
Multiemployer Plan (as hereinafter defined)), a "welfare plan" (as defined in
Section 3(1) of ERISA), or any material bonus, profit sharing, deferred
compensation, incentive compensation, stock ownership, stock purchase, stock
option, phantom stock, vacation, severance, death benefit, insurance or other
plan, arrangement or understanding, in each case established or maintained or
contributed to by York or any of its ERISA Affiliates or as to which York or any
of its ERISA Affiliates or otherwise may have any liability, whether or not
covered by ERISA), (ii) "YORK MULTIEMPLOYER PLAN" means a "multiemployer plan"
(as defined in Section 4001(a)(3) of ERISA) to which York or any of its ERISA
Affiliates is or has been obligated to contribute or otherwise may have any
liability, and (iii) with respect to any person, "ERISA AFFILIATE" means any
corporation or trade or business (whether or not incorporated) which is under
common control, or otherwise would be considered a single employer with such
person pursuant to Section 414(b), (c), (m) or (o) of the Code and the
regulations promulgated thereunder or pursuant to Section 4001(b) of ERISA and
the regulations promulgated thereunder.

                  (e) SECTION 2.12(e) of the York Disclosure Letter
contains a list, as of the date of this Agreement, of all (i) severance and
employment agreements with officers of York and each ERISA Affiliate, (ii)
severance programs and policies of York with or relating to its employees and
(iii) plans, programs, agreements and other arrangements of York with or
relating to its employees which contain change of control or similar provisions,
in each case involving a severance or employment agreement or arrangement with
an individual officer or employee, only to the extent such agreement or
arrangement provides for minimum annual payments in excess of $50,000. York has
provided to Matthews a true and complete copy of each of the foregoing.

                  (f) Except as otherwise provided in SECTION 2.12(f) of
the York Disclosure Letter, the consummation of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement will not accelerate the time of payment or vesting under any York
Plan nor obligate any of York, the Surviving Corporation or Matthews to provide

                                   -16-

any current or former officer, director or employee of York or any of its
Subsidiary with severance pay, unemployment compensation or similar payment.

                  Section 2.13. LABOR MATTERS. Except as disclosed in SECTION
2.13 of the York Disclosure Letter, (i) neither York nor any of its Subsidiaries
is party to any collective bargaining agreement or other labor agreement with
any union or labor organization and no union or labor organization has been
recognized by York or any of its Subsidiaries as an exclusive bargaining
representative for employees of York or any of its Subsidiaries, (ii) neither
York nor any of its Subsidiaries is the subject of any material proceeding
asserting that it or any of its Subsidiaries has committed an unfair labor
practice or is seeking to compel it to bargain with any labor union or labor
organization, and (iii) to the Knowledge of York there is no pending,
threatened, nor has there been for the past three years, any labor strike,
dispute, walkout, work stoppage, slow-down or lockout involving it or any of its
Subsidiaries: except in each case as would not, individually or in the
aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect on York.

                                    ARTICLE V
                              ADDITIONAL AGREEMENTS

                  Section 5.1. NO SOLICITATION. (a) York agrees that it shall
not, nor shall it permit any of its Subsidiaries to, nor shall it authorize any
officer, director or employee or any investment banker, attorney, accountant,
agent or other advisor or representative of York, or any of its respective
Subsidiaries to, (i) solicit, initiate or knowingly encourage the submission of
any Takeover Proposal, (ii) enter into any agreement with respect to a Takeover
Proposal or (iii) participate in any discussions or negotiations regarding, or
furnish to any Person any information with respect to, or take any other action
to facilitate any inquiries or the making of any proposal that constitutes, or
may reasonably be expected to lead to, any Takeover Proposal; PROVIDED, HOWEVER,
that to the extent required by the fiduciary obligations of the board of
directors of York as determined in good faith by a majority of the members
thereof (after consultation with outside legal counsel), York may, in response
to unsolicited requests therefor, participate in discussions or negotiations
with, and furnish information pursuant to a confidentiality agreement no less
favorable to such party than the Confidentiality Agreement (as defined in
SECTION 5.4) to, any Person who indicates a willingness to make a Superior
Proposal. York immediately shall cease all existing discussions or negotiations
with any Persons conducted heretofore with respect to, or that could reasonably
be expected to lead to, any Takeover Proposal. For all purposes of this
Agreement, (i) "TAKEOVER PROPOSAL" means any proposal for a merger,
consolidation, share exchange, business combination or other similar transaction
involving York, or any of its Significant Subsidiaries (as hereinafter defined)
or any proposal or offer to acquire, directly or indirectly, an equity interest
in, at least 15% of the voting securities of, or a substantial portion of the
assets of, York or any of its Significant Subsidiaries, other than the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (ii) "SUPERIOR PROPOSAL" means a
bona fide written proposal made by a third party to acquire all of the
outstanding equity interests in or substantially all of the assets of York
pursuant to a tender or exchange offer, a merger, a share exchange, a sale of
all or substantially all its assets or otherwise on terms which a majority of
the members of the board of directors of York determines in good faith (taking
into account the advice of independent financial advisors) to be more favorable
to York and its stockholders than the Merger , and (iii) a "SIGNIFICANT
SUBSIDIARY" means any Subsidiary that would constitute a "significant
subsidiary" within the meaning of Rule 1-02 of Regulation S-X of the SEC.

                  (b) Except as otherwise provided in this SECTION 5.1(b),
neither the board of directors of York nor any committee thereof shall (i)
withdraw or modify, or propose to withdraw or modify, in a manner adverse to
Matthews, the approval or recommendation by the board of directors of York or
any such committee of this Agreement or the Merger or (ii) approve or recommend,
or propose to approve or recommend, any Takeover Proposal. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, (i) the board of directors of York, to the extent required by its
fiduciary obligations, as determined in good faith by a majority of the members
thereof (after consultation with outside legal counsel), may approve or
recommend a Superior Proposal or withdraw or modify its approval or
recommendation of this Agreement or the Merger and (ii) nothing contained in
this

                                   -26-

Agreement shall prevent the board of directors of York from complying with
Rule 14d-9 and Rule 14e-2 promulgated under the Exchange Act with regard to a
Takeover Proposal.

                  (c) York shall notify Matthews promptly (but in no event later
than one business day) after receipt by York (or its advisors) of any Takeover
Proposal or any request for nonpublic information in connection with a Takeover
Proposal or for access to the properties, books or records of York by any Person
or entity that informs York that it is considering making, or has made, a
Takeover Proposal. Such notice shall be made orally and in writing. York shall
keep Matthews informed, on a current basis, of the status of any such Takeover
Proposal or request.

                  Section 5.2. PROXY STATEMENT. (a) York shall prepare and file
with the SEC the Proxy Statement at a time which is appropriate in view of the
anticipated Closing Date. The Proxy Statement shall include the recommendation
of the board of directors of York in favor of approval and adoption of this
Agreement and the Merger, except to the extent the board of directors of York,
in accordance with the terms of SECTION 5.1(b), shall have withdrawn or modified
its approval or recommendation of this Agreement and the Merger. Matthews shall
assist and cooperate with York in preparing the Proxy Statement and shall
provide York with information required to be disclosed in the Proxy Statement
relating to Matthews. York shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to
cause the Proxy Statement to be mailed to its stockholders as promptly as
practicable after SEC approval. If at any time prior to the Effective Time any
event with respect to any party or its officers and directors or any of its
Subsidiaries shall occur that is required to be described in the Proxy
Statement, the parties will work together in good faith to ensure that such
event shall be so described, and an appropriate amendment or supplement shall be
promptly filed with the SEC and, as required by law, disseminated to the
stockholders of York. Each party agrees that the Proxy Statement will comply
(with respect to such party) as to form in all material respects with the
provisions of the Exchange Act.

                  (b) York and Matthews shall make all necessary filings with
respect to the Merger and the transactions contemplated thereby under the
Securities Act and the Exchange Act and applicable "Blue Sky" laws and the rules
and regulations thereunder. No filing of, or supplement to, the Proxy Statement
will be made by York without providing Matthews the opportunity to review and
comment thereon. If at any time prior to the Effective Time any information
relating to York or Matthews, or any of their respective affiliates, officers or
directors, should be discovered by York or Matthews which should be set forth in
a supplement to the Proxy Statement, so that such Proxy Statement would not
include any misstatement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact
necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under
which they were made, not misleading, the party which discovers such information
shall promptly notify the other parties hereto and an appropriate amendment or
supplement describing such information shall be promptly filed with the SEC and,
to the extent required by law, disseminated to York stockholders.

                  Section 5.3. STOCKHOLDERS MEETING. York shall duly call, give
notice of, convene and hold a meeting of its stockholders (the "STOCKHOLDERS
MEETING") for the purpose of voting on the adoption of this Agreement and,
through its board of directors, will recommend to its stockholders adoption of
this Agreement, except to the extent that the board of directors of York shall
have withdrawn or modified its approval or recommendation of this Agreement and
the Merger as permitted by SECTION 5.1(b). In a manner consistent with its
fiduciary duties to its stockholders and as it may reasonably determine to be
consistent with the objective of consummating the Merger, York shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to convene the Stockholders Meeting within 45
days of the Proxy Statement being approved by the SEC. So long as the York board
continues to recommend the Merger, York shall use its commercially reasonable
efforts to solicit from its stockholders proxies in favor of the Merger and to
take all other action necessary or advisable to secure the vote or consent of
the stockholders required to effect the Merger. In the Proxy, York will take all
actions required under the DGCL to notify its stockholders that appraisal rights
are available for York

                                   -27-

Common Stock pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL including sending a copy of
Section 262 of the DGCL to its stockholders.

                  Section 5.4. ACCESS TO INFORMATION. Upon reasonable notice and
subject to applicable law and other legal obligations, York shall, and shall
cause each of its Subsidiaries to, afford to the officers, employees,
accountants, counsel and other representatives of Matthews, access, during the
period prior to the Effective Time, to all its properties, books, contracts,
commitments and records and, during such period, York shall, and shall cause
each of its Subsidiaries to, furnish promptly to Matthews (a) a copy of each
report, schedule, registration statement and other document filed or received by
it during such period pursuant to the requirements of federal securities laws
and (b) all other information concerning its business, properties and personnel
as Matthews may reasonably request. Unless otherwise required by law, the
parties will hold any such information which is nonpublic in confidence in
accordance with Confidentiality Agreement dated as of January 16, 2001 between
York and Matthews (the "CONFIDENTIALITY AGREEMENT"). No information or knowledge
obtained in any investigation pursuant to this SECTION 5.4 shall affect or be
deemed to modify any representation or warranty contained in this Agreement or
the conditions to the obligations of the parties to consummate the Merger.

                  Section 5.5. NOTICES OF CERTAIN EVENTS. (a) York and Matthews
shall promptly notify each other of:

                           (i) any notice or other communication from any Person
         alleging that the consent of such Person is or may be required in
         connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; and

                           (ii) any notice or other communication from any
         Governmental Entity in connection with the transactions contemplated by
         this Agreement.

                           (iii) any actions, suits, claims, investigations or
         proceedings commenced or, to the knowledge of either party, threatened
         against, relating to or involving or otherwise affecting either party
         or any of their Subsidiaries which, if pending on the date of this
         Agreement, would have been required to have been disclosed pursuant to
         SECTION 2.10 or which relate to the consummation of the transactions
         contemplated by this Agreement;

                           (iv) any fact or event which would be reasonably
         likely to demonstrate that any representation or warranty of any party
         hereto contained in this Agreement was or is untrue or inaccurate in
         any material respect as of the date of this Agreement;

                           (v) the occurrence or non-occurrence of any fact or
         event which would be reasonably likely to cause any material covenant,
         condition or agreement of any party hereto under this Agreement not to
         be complied with or satisfied in all material respects;

                           (vi) any failure of any party hereto to comply with
         or satisfy any covenant, condition or agreement to be complied with or
         satisfied by it hereunder in any material respect;

         PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that no such notification shall affect the
         representations or warranties of any party or the conditions to the
         obligations of any party hereunder.

                  Section 5.6. APPROPRIATE ACTION; CONSENTS; FILINGS. (a)
Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement and except to the extent
that the board of directors of York shall have withdrawn or modified its
approval or recommendation of this Agreement or the Merger, as permitted by
SECTION 5.1(b),

                                   -28-

York and Matthews shall use their reasonable best efforts to (A) take, or
cause to be taken, all actions, and do, or cause to be done, all things,
necessary, proper or advisable under applicable laws to consummate the Merger
and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement as promptly as
practicable, (B) obtain from any Governmental Entity any consents, licenses,
permits, waivers, approvals, authorizations or orders required to be obtained
or made by York and Matthews or any of their Subsidiaries, or to avoid any
action or proceeding by any Governmental Entity (including, without
limitation, those in connection with the HSR Act or other foreign laws or
regulations), in connection with the authorization, execution and delivery of
this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated herein,
and (C) make all necessary filings, and thereafter make any other required
submissions, with respect to this Agreement and the Merger required under the
Securities Act, the Exchange Act and any other applicable law; PROVIDED,
HOWEVER, that York and Matthews shall cooperate with each other in connection
with the making of all such filings, including providing copies of all such
documents to the non-filing party and its advisors prior to filing and, if
requested, accepting all reasonable additions, deletions or changes suggested
in connection therewith. York and Matthews shall furnish to each other all
information required for any application or other filing to be made pursuant
to the rules and regulations of any applicable law in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Subject to the terms and
conditions of this Agreement and except to the extent that the board of
directors of York shall have withdrawn or modified its approval or
recommendation of this Agreement or the Merger, as permitted by SECTION
5.1(b), York and Matthews shall not take any action, or refrain from taking
any action, the effect of which would be to delay or impede the ability of
York and Matthews to consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.

                  (b) Each of Matthews and York shall use their reasonable best
efforts to resolve such objections, if any, as may be asserted by any
Governmental Entity with respect to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement under HSR, the Sherman Act, as amended, the Clayton Act, as amended,
the Federal Trade Commission Act, as amended, and any other Federal, state or
foreign statutes, rules, regulations, orders or decrees that are designed to
prohibit, restrict or regulate actions having the purpose or effect of
monopolization or restraint of trade (collectively, "ANTITRUST LAWS"). In
connection therewith, if any administrative or judicial action or proceeding is
instituted (or threatened to be instituted) challenging any transaction
contemplated by this Agreement as violative of any Antitrust Law, each of
Matthews and York shall cooperate and use their reasonable best efforts to
contest and resist any such action or proceeding and to have vacated, lifted,
reversed, or overturned any decree, judgment, injunction or other order, whether
temporary, preliminary or permanent (each, an "ORDER"), that is in effect and
that prohibits, prevents, or restricts consummation of the Merger or any such
other transactions, unless by mutual agreement Matthews and York decide that
litigation is not in their respective best interests. Each of Matthews and York
shall use their reasonable best efforts to take such action as may be required
to cause the expiration of the notice periods under the HSR or other Antitrust
Laws with respect to the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement as promptly as possible after the execution of this Agreement.
Matthews and York also agree to take any and all of the following actions to the
extent necessary to obtain the approval of any Governmental Entity with
jurisdiction over the enforcement of any applicable laws regarding the
transactions contemplated hereby: entering into negotiations; providing
information required by law or governmental regulation; and complying with any
additional requests for information pursuant to the Antitrust Laws.

                  (c) (i) York and Matthews shall give, or shall cause their
respective Subsidiaries to give, any notices to third parties, and use, and
cause their respective Subsidiaries to use, commercially reasonable efforts to
obtain any third party consents necessary, proper or advisable in order to
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

                  (ii) In the event that either party shall fail to obtain any
third party consent described in Section 5.6(c)(i) above, such party shall use
commercially reasonable efforts, and shall take any such actions

                                   -29-

reasonably requested by the other party hereto, to minimize any adverse
effect upon York and Matthews, their respective Subsidiaries, and their
respective businesses resulting, or which could reasonably be expected to
result after the Effective Time, from the failure to obtain such consent.

                  Section 5.7. PUBLIC DISCLOSURE. York and Matthews will consult
with each other before issuing any press release or otherwise making any public
statement with respect to the Merger, this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby and shall not issue any such press release or make any such
public statement without the prior consent of the other party, which shall not
be unreasonably withheld or delayed. York will consult with Matthews before
issuing any press releases or making any other public statements containing
forward looking information and shall not issue any such press release or make
any such statement without the prior consent of Matthews, which shall not be
unreasonably withheld or delayed. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any such press
release or public statement as may be required by applicable law or any listing
agreement with any national securities exchange may be issued prior to
consultation, if the party making such release or statement has used its
reasonable efforts to consult with the other party.

         Section 5.8. INDEMNIFICATION OF DIRECTORS AND OFFICERS. (a) After the
Effective Time, Matthews and the Surviving Corporation shall jointly and
severally, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, indemnify, hold
harmless, and defend each and every present and former director, officer,
employee, fiduciary, and agent of York and each Subsidiary of York
(collectively, the "INDEMNIFIED PARTIES") from and against all attorneys' fees,
judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages, liabilities, settlement amounts,
costs and expenses ("ADVERSE CONSEQUENCES") in connection with any claim,
action, suit, proceeding or investigation (whether arising or relating to facts
occurring before, at or after the Effective Time), whether civil, administrative
or investigative ("PROCEEDING"), arising out of or pertaining to any action or
omission in their capacity as an officer, director, employee, fiduciary or agent
(including the transactions contemplated by this Agreement) provided that any
determination required to be made with respect to whether an Indemnified Party's
conduct complies with the standards set forth under Delaware law or the
provisions hereunder, as the case may be, shall be made by independent counsel
selected by the Indemnified Party and reasonably acceptable to Matthews; and
that nothing herein shall impair any rights or obligations of any Indemnified
Party. In the event that any claim or claims are brought against any Indemnified
Party (whether arising before or after the Effective Time), such Indemnified
Party may select counsel for the defense of such claim, which counsel shall be
reasonably acceptable to York (if selected prior to the Effective Time) and
Matthews (if selected after the Effective Time).

         (b) For a period of six years from the Effective Time, the Surviving
Corporation and Matthews shall provide to the Indemnified Parties liability
insurance protection substantially equivalent in kind and scope as that provided
by York's current directors' and officers' liability insurance policies (copies
of which have been made available to Matthews); PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that in no
event shall the Surviving Corporation and Matthews be required to expend in any
one year an amount in excess of 150% of the annual premiums currently paid by
York for such insurance; PROVIDED, FURTHER, that if during such period the
annual premiums for such comparable insurance coverage exceed such amount, the
Surviving Corporation and Matthews shall be obligated to provide a policy which,
in the reasonable judgment of the Surviving Corporation and Matthews, provides
the best coverage available for a cost not exceeding such amount.

         (c) To the extent there is any Proceeding (whether arising before or
after the Effective Time) against an Indemnified Party that arises out of or
pertains to any action or omission in his or her capacity as director, officer,
employee, fiduciary or agent of York occurring prior to the Effective Time, or
arises out of or pertains to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement for
a period of six years after the Effective Time (whether arising before or after
the Effective Time), in each case for which such Indemnified Party is
indemnified under this SECTION 5.11, such Indemnified Party shall be entitled to
be represented by counsel, reasonable costs and fees of which shall be paid when
due by Matthews following the Effective Time.

                                   -30-

Neither the Surviving Corporation nor Matthews shall be bound by any
settlement effected unless one or the other gives written consent (which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld by either). In the event that any
claim or claims for indemnification are asserted or made prior to the date
that is six years after the Effective Time, all rights to indemnification and
defense in respect to any such claim or claims shall continue until the
disposition of any and all such claims.

         (d) If any Indemnified Party is entitled under any provision of this
Agreement to indemnification by Matthews or the Surviving Corporation for only a
portion (but not, however, for the total amount) of any Adverse Consequences
actually incurred by Indemnitee in connection with any Proceeding, Matthews and
the Surviving Corporation shall nevertheless indemnify such Indemnified Party
for the portion of such Adverse Consequences to which such Indemnified Party is
entitled. If the indemnification provided for herein in respect of any Adverse
Consequences actually incurred by such Indemnified Party in connection with any
Proceeding is finally determined by a court of competent jurisdiction to be
prohibited by applicable law, then Matthews and the Surviving Corporation, in
lieu of indemnifying such Indemnified Party, shall contribute to the amount paid
or payable as a result of such Adverse Consequences in such proportion as is
appropriate to reflect (i) the relative benefits received by Matthews, the
Surviving Corporation, York and/or any Subsidiary on the one hand and the
Indemnified Party on the other hand from the events, circumstances, conditions,
happenings, actions or transactions from which such Adverse Consequences arose,
(ii) the relative fault of Matthews, the Surviving Corporation, York and/or any
Subsidiary (including its representatives) on the one hand and of the
Indemnified Party on the other hand in connection with the events, circumstances
and happenings which resulted in such Adverse Consequences, such relative fault
to be determined by reference to, among other things, the parties' relative
intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent
the events, circumstances and/or happenings resulting in such Adverse
Consequences, and (iii) any other relevant equitable considerations, it being
agreed that it would not be just and equitable if such contribution were
determined by pro rata or other method of allocation which does not take into
account the foregoing equitable considerations.

         (e) The indemnification provided herein shall be applicable whether or
not negligence of the Indemnified Party is alleged or proved, and regardless of
whether such negligence be contributory or sole.

         (f) If requested to do so by the Indemnified Party with respect to any
Proceeding, Matthews shall advance to or for the benefit of the Indemnified
Party, prior to the final disposition of such Proceeding, the expenses actually
incurred by such Indemnified Party in investigating, defending or appealing such
Proceeding. Any judgments, fines or amounts to be paid in settlement of any
Proceeding shall also be advanced by Matthews upon request by the Indemnified
Party. Advances made by Matthews are subject to refund as provided in the
following paragraph.

         (g) If Matthews advances or pays any amount to the Indemnified Party
under this Section and if it shall thereafter be finally adjudicated that the
Indemnified Party was not entitled to be indemnified hereunder for all or any
portion of such amount, then the Indemnified Party shall promptly repay such
amount or such portion thereof, as the case may be, to Matthews. If Matthews
advances or pays any amount to an Indemnified Party under this Section and if
the Indemnified Party shall thereafter receive all or a portion of such amount
under one or more policies of directors and officers liability insurance, such
Indemnified Party shall promptly repay such amount or such portion thereof, as
the case may be, to Matthews.

         (h) If any change after the date of this Agreement in any applicable
law, statute or rule expands the power of Matthews or the Surviving Corporation
to indemnify any Indemnified Party, such change shall be within the purview of
such Indemnified Party's rights and Matthew's and the Surviving Corporation's
obligations under this Agreement. If any change after the date of this Agreement
in any applicable law, statute or rule narrows the right of Matthews or the
Surviving Corporation to indemnify an Indemnified Party,

                                   -31-

such change shall, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, leave
this Agreement and the parties' rights and obligations hereunder unaffected.

         (i) The indemnification and other rights provided by any provisions of
this Agreement shall not be deemed exclusive of any other rights to which any
Indemnified Party may be entitled under (i) any statutory or common law, (ii)
Matthew's, the Surviving Corporation's, York's or any Subsidiary's articles or
certificate of incorporation, (iii) Matthews, the Surviving Corporation's,
York's, or any Subsidiary's bylaws, (iv) any other agreement or (v) any vote of
stockholders or disinterested directors or otherwise, both as to action in the
Indemnified Party's official capacity and as to action in another capacity while
occupying any of the positions or having any of the relationships referred to in
this Agreement. Nothing in this Agreement shall in any manner affect, impair or
compromise any indemnification, any Indemnified Party has or may have by virtue
of any agreement previously entered into between such Indemnified Party and
Matthews, the Surviving Corporation, York or any Subsidiary.

         (j) The indemnification provisions of this SECTION 5.8 of this
Agreement shall inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by (i) each
Indemnified Party and any Indemnified Party's personal or legal representatives,
executors, administrators, heirs, devisees and legatees and (ii) Matthews, the
Surviving Corporation, York, the Subsidiaries and their respective successors
and assigns. This SECTION 5.8 shall not inure to the benefit of any other
Person. Matthews and the Surviving Corporation agree to require any successor
(whether direct or indirect, by purchase, merger, consolidation or otherwise) to
all or substantially all of the business and/or assets of Matthews or the
Surviving Corporation, as applicable, to expressly assume and agree to perform
this Agreement in the same manner and to the same extent that Matthews and/or
the Surviving Corporation, as applicable, would be required to perform it if no
such succession had taken place. As used in this Section, the term "Matthews"
and the term "Surviving Corporation" shall include any successor to their
respective businesses and/or assets as aforesaid which executes and delivers the
assumption and agreement provided for in this Section or which otherwise becomes
bound by all terms and provisions of this Agreement by operation of law.

                  Section 5.9. STATE TAKEOVER LAWS. If any "fair price,"
"business combination" or "control share acquisition" statute or other similar
statute or regulation shall become applicable to the transactions contemplated
hereby, York shall use its reasonable best efforts to grant such approvals and
take such actions as are necessary so that the transactions contemplated hereby
and thereby may be consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms
contemplated hereby and thereby and otherwise act to minimize the effects of any
such statute or regulation on the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby.

                  Section 5.10. RIGHTS AGREEMENT. York hereby agrees that it has
taken and will continue to take all necessary action to ensure that none of the
transactions contemplated in this Agreement will cause Matthews, the Merger Sub
or any of Matthews' affiliates or associates to become an Acquiring Person under
the York Rights Agreement or subject to York's rights under Section 5.1,
otherwise affect in any way the rights under the York Rights Agreement,

credit for years of service with York, its subsidiaries and their predecessors
for all employee benefit purposes, with the exception of the defined benefit
pension plans of Matthews.

                  Section 7.1. TERMINATION. This Agreement may be terminated at
any time prior to the Effective Time (with respect to SECTIONS 7.1(b) through

by the stockholders of York:

                  (a)  by mutual written consent of York and Matthews; or

                  (b) by York or Matthews, if the Merger shall not have been
consummated by December 31, 2001 (the "END DATE"); PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that the
right to terminate this Agreement under this SECTION 7.1(b) shall not be
available to any party whose failure to fulfill any obligation under this
Agreement has been the cause of or resulted in the failure of the Merger to
occur on or before the End Date; and PROVIDED, FURTHER, that the End Date may be
extended by York until five days after the earlier of the expiration or
termination of any applicable waiting period under the HSR Act; or

                  (c) by York or Matthews, if a court of competent jurisdiction
or other Governmental Entity shall have issued a final, non-appealable order,
decree or ruling, or taken any other action, having the effect of permanently
restraining, enjoining or otherwise prohibiting the Merger; or

                  (f) by Matthews or York, if the Board of Directors of York
shall have determined to recommend a Takeover Proposal to its shareholders and
to enter into a binding written agreement concerning such Takeover Proposal
after determining, pursuant to SECTION 5.1, that such Takeover Proposal
constitutes a Superior Proposal; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that York may not terminate
this Agreement pursuant to this SECTION 7.1(f) unless (i) York has delivered to
Matthews a written notice of York's intent to enter into such an agreement to
effect the Superior Proposal and (ii) five business days have elapsed following
delivery to Matthews of such written notice by York; or

                  (g) by Matthews, if a material breach of or failure to perform
any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement on the part of York set
forth in this Agreement shall have occurred which remains uncured for a period
of ten (10) business days after the notice of such breach or failure and such
breach or failure would cause the conditions set forth in SECTIONS 6.3(a) or
6.3(b) not to be satisfied, and such conditions are incapable of being satisfied
by the End Date; or

                  (h) by York, if a material breach of or failure to perform any
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement on the part of Matthews set
forth in this Agreement shall have occurred which remains

                                   -34-

uncured for a period of ten (10) business days after the notice of such
breach or failure and such breach or failure would cause the conditions set
forth in SECTIONS 6.2(a) or 6.2(b) not to be satisfied, and such conditions
are incapable of being satisfied by the End Date; or

                  (i) by York, if the Threshold EBITDA is achieved and the York
Equity Value is greater than $11 per share; or

                  Section 7.2. EFFECT OF TERMINATION. In the event of
termination of this Agreement pursuant to SECTION 7.1, there shall be no
liability or obligation on the part of York, Matthews or their respective
officers, directors, stockholders or Affiliates, except as set forth in SECTION
7.3, or except to the extent that such termination results from willful breach
by a party of any of its representations, warranties, covenants or agreements
contained in this Agreement; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that the provisions of SECTIONS
7.3 and 7.4, of this Agreement and the Confidentiality Agreement shall remain in
full force and effect and survive any termination of this Agreement.

                  Section 7.3. FEES AND EXPENSES. (a) Except as set forth in
this SECTION 7.3 or elsewhere in this Agreement, all fees and expenses incurred
in connection with this Agreement and closing the Merger contemplated hereby
shall be paid by the party incurring such expenses, whether or not the Merger is
consummated; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that York and Matthews shall share equally all
fees and expenses, other than attorneys' and accounting fees and expenses,
incurred in relation to the printing and filing of the Proxy Statement
(including any related preliminary materials).

                  (b) If this Agreement is terminated (i) by Matthews pursuant

is greater than $11 per share, or (ii) by York pursuant to SECTION 7.1(i), York
shall pay to Matthews a termination fee of $6,000,000 by wire transfer within
one business day after such termination. If the Threshold EBITDA is achieved and
the York Equity Value is greater than $11 per share, any termination by York
under Section 7.1(d) shall be presumed to be under Section 7.1(i) rather than
Section 7.1(d).

                  (c) If (i) this Agreement is terminated by York pursuant to
SECTION 7.1(d) and either (x) a Takeover Proposal with respect to York shall
have been made after the date of this Agreement and prior to the Stockholders
Meeting or (y) York's Board of Directors shall not have recommended or shall
have withdrawn its recommendation of this Agreement and the Merger or (ii) this
Agreement is terminated by York or Matthews pursuant to SECTION 7.1(f), and, in
the case of either (i) or (ii) above, York or its stockholders consummate the
sale or transfer, by way of merger, consolidation or otherwise, of a majority
interest in the equity of York or substantially all of York's assets to any
other Person within nine months of the date of termination of this Agreement,
then York shall pay the $6,000,000 termination fee within one day after the
closing of such transaction.

                  (d) If this Agreement is terminated by Matthews pursuant to
SECTION 7.1(b), 7.1(c), 7.1(d), 7.1(g) (except in the case of an intentional
misrepresentation by York), OR 7.1(j), Matthews shall pay to York a termination
fee of $6,000,000 by wire transfer within one business day after such
termination.

                  (e) If this Agreement is terminated by York pursuant to
SECTION 7.1(b), 7.1(c) OR 7.1(h), Matthews shall pay York a termination fee of
$6,000,000 by wire transfer within one business day after such termination.

                                   -35-

                  (f) If any party is obligated to pay a termination fee under
any of the subsections of SECTION 7.3 described above, in any such case it shall
only be obligated to pay such fee once. If one party fails to promptly pay to
the other any fee or expense due hereunder, the defaulting party shall pay the
costs and expenses (including reasonable legal fees and expenses) in connection
with any action, including the filing of any lawsuit or other legal action,
taken to collect payment, together with interest on the amount of any unpaid fee
at the publicly announced prime rate of Mellon Bank, N.A. from the date such fee
was required to be paid.

                  Section 7.4. POST-TERMINATION OBLIGATIONS. In the event of
termination of this Agreement, Matthews and Merger Sub shall and shall cause
their Affiliates to return all documents and copies and other materials received
from or on behalf of York, its Affiliates, its Subsidiaries and its agents
relating to the transactions contemplated hereby, whether so obtained before or
after the execution hereof, to York, and York shall and shall cause its
Affiliates to return all documents and copies and other materials received from
or on behalf of Matthews and Merger Sub relating to the transactions
contemplated hereby, whether so obtained before or after the execution hereof,
to Matthews; and all information received or accumulated by the parties hereto
shall be treated as "Confidential Information" in accordance with the
Confidentiality Agreement (as modified or supplemented by this Agreement) which
shall remain in full force and effect, as modified or supplemented by this
Agreement, notwithstanding the termination of this Agreement.

                                  MISCELLANEOUS

                  Section 8.1. NONSURVIVAL OF REPRESENTATIONS, WARRANTIES AND
AGREEMENTS. None of the representations, warranties, covenants and agreements in
this Agreement or in any instrument delivered pursuant to this Agreement shall
survive the Effective Time, except for covenants and agreements which, by their
terms, are to be performed after the Effective Time. The Confidentiality
Agreement shall survive the execution and delivery of this Agreement but shall
terminate and be of no further force and effect as of the Effective Time.

                  Section 8.3. INTERPRETATION AND CONSTRUCTION, SEVERABILITY;
INTERPRETATION OF OBLIGATIONS.

                    (a) INTERPRETATION AND CONSTRUCTION. Matthews and York have
participated jointly in the negotiation and drafting of this Agreement. If an
ambiguity or question of intent or interpretation arises, this Agreement shall
be construed as if drafted jointly by Matthews and York and no presumption or
burden of proof shall arise favoring or disfavoring either Matthews or York
because of the authorship of any of the provisions of this Agreement. Any
reference to any United States Federal, state, local or foreign statute or law
shall be deemed also to refer to all rules and regulations promulgated
thereunder, unless the context requires otherwise. Unless the context of this
Agreement otherwise requires, (a) words of any gender are deemed to include each
other gender; (b) words using the singular or plural number also include the
plural or singular number, respectively; (c) the terms "hereof," "herein,"
"hereby," "hereto," and derivative or similar words refer to this entire
Agreement; (d) the terms "ARTICLE" or "Section" refer to the specified ARTICLE
or Section of this Agreement; (e) the term "party" means, on the one hand,
Matthews, on the other hand, York, (f) the word "including" means "including
without limitation"; and (g) all references to "dollars" or "$" refer to
currency of the United States of America. The exhibits and schedules specified
in this Agreement are incorporated herein by reference and made a part hereof.
The article and section headings hereof are for convenience only and shall not
affect the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement.

                    (b) SEVERABILITY. The invalidity or unenforceability of one
or more of the provisions of this Agreement in any situation in any jurisdiction
shall not affect the validity or enforceability of any other provision hereof or
the validity or enforceability of the offending provision in any other situation
or jurisdiction.

                                   -37-

                    (c) INTERPRETATION OF OBLIGATIONS. Notwithstanding anything
in this Agreement to the contrary, Matthews shall not be permitted to terminate
this Agreement solely because of an Order to divest any business, product line
or assets, regardless of whether such action could result in a Material Adverse
Effect on York, Matthews or the benefits to Matthews of the consummation of the
Merger. Matthews agrees to divest such business, product line or assets, as the
case may be, pursuant to such Order, or as may be required to cause the
expiration of the notice periods under the HSR or other Antitrust Laws, after an
opportunity to negotiate, contest or appeal any such Order or requirement;
PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that such right of Matthews to negotiate, contest or appeal
shall not extend beyond December 20, 2001.

                  Section 8.4. COUNTERPARTS. This Agreement may be executed in
two or more counterparts, all of which shall be considered one and the same
agreement and shall become effective when two or more counterparts have been
signed by each of the parties and delivered to the other parties, it being
understood that all parties need not sign the same counterpart.

                  Section 8.5. ENTIRE AGREEMENT; NO THIRD PARTY BENEFICIARIES.
This Agreement (including the documents and the instruments referred to herein),
(a) constitute the entire agreement and supersedes all prior agreements and
understandings, both written and oral, among the parties with respect to the
subject matter hereof, and (b) except as provided in SECTION 5.8 and SECTION
5.11 of this Agreement and this SECTION 8.5, are not intended to confer upon any
Person other than the parties hereto any rights or remedies hereunder or
thereunder.

                  Section 8.6. GOVERNING LAW. This Agreement shall be governed
by, and construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of Delaware,
regardless of the laws that might otherwise govern under the applicable
principles of conflicts of laws thereof.

                  Section 8.7. ASSIGNMENT. Neither this Agreement nor any of the
rights, interests or obligations hereunder shall be assigned by any of the
parties hereto (whether by operation of law or otherwise) without the prior
written consent of the other parties, and any attempted assignment thereof
without such consent shall be null and void. Subject to the preceding sentence,
this Agreement will be binding upon, inure to the benefit of and be enforceable
by the parties and their respective successors and assigns.

                  Section 8.8 AMENDMENT. This Agreement may be amended by the
parties hereto, by action taken or authorized by their respective boards of
directors, at any time before or after approval of the matters presented in
connection with the Merger by the stockholders of York, but, after any such
approval, no amendment shall be made which by law requires further approval by
such stockholders without such further approval. This Agreement may not be
amended except by an instrument in writing signed on behalf of each of the
parties hereto.

                  Section 8.9 EXTENSION; WAIVER. At any time prior to the
Effective Time, the parties hereto may, to the extent legally allowed, (i)
extend the time for the performance of any of the obligations or other acts of
the other parties hereto contained herein, (ii) waive any inaccuracies in the
representations and warranties of the other parties hereto contained herein or
in any document delivered hereto and (iii) waive compliance with any of the
agreements or conditions of the other parties hereto contained herein. Any
agreement on the part of a party hereto to any such extension or waiver shall be
valid only if set forth in a written instrument signed on behalf of such party.

                  Section 8.10 CONSENT TO JURISDICTION: APPOINTMENT OF AGENT FOR
SERVICE OF PROCESS. Each party hereto hereby (a) submits to the jurisdiction of
any court of the State of Delaware and the Federal courts sitting in the State
of Delaware with respect to such matters arising out of or relating to, this
Agreement and

                                   -38-

the transactions contemplated hereby, (b) agrees that all claims with respect
to such action or proceeding may be heard and determined in such Delaware
state or Federal court, (c) waives the defense of an inconvenient forum in
connection therewith, (d) consents to service of process upon it by mailing

proceeding shall be conclusive and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by
suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided by law, and (f) to the
extent that it or its properties have or hereafter may acquire immunity from
jurisdiction of any such court or from any legal process (whether through
service or notice, attachment prior to judgment, attachment in aid of
execution, execution or otherwise), waives such immunity in respect of its
obligations under this Agreement.

                     [Signature page to follow]

                                   -39-

                  IN WITNESS WHEREOF, Matthews, Merger Sub and York have caused
this Merger Agreement to be signed by their respective officers thereunto duly
authorized as of the date first written above.

Board of Directors
The York Group, Inc.
Houston, Texas

Dear Gentlemen:

         We understand that The York Group, Inc. ("York" or the "Company") is
considering entering into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the "Agreement") with
Matthews International Corporation ("Matthews") and Empire Merger Corp., a
wholly-owned subsidiary of Matthews ("Empire"), pursuant to which Empire will,
upon the realization of certain events, merge with and into York (the "Merger").
The amount of cash to be paid to the shareholders of York shall be (a) $10 per
share of York common stock, plus (b) the Excess Cash Increment (as defined in
the Agreement) of up to $1.00 per share. As a condition to the merger, York's
EBITDA for the nine-months ending September 30, 2001, must equal or exceed
$9,000,000, otherwise Matthews shall be permitted to terminate the Agreement.

         The merger contemplated by the Agreement and all related transactions
are referred to collectively herein as the "Transaction."

         You have requested our opinion (the "Opinion") as to the matters set
forth below. The Opinion does not address the Company's underlying business
decision to effect the Transaction. We have not been requested to, and did not,
solicit third party indications of interest in acquiring all or any part of the
Company. Furthermore, at your request, we did not participate in the structuring
of the Transaction or in the negotiation of the Agreement.

         In connection with this Opinion, we have made such reviews, analyses
and inquiries as we have deemed necessary and appropriate under the
circumstances. Among other things, we have:

      1.    reviewed the Company's annual reports to shareholders and on Form
            10-K for the five fiscal years ended December 31, 2000 and quarterly
            reports on Form 10-Q for the years 1999 and 2000, and
            Company-prepared interim financial statements for the period ended
            April 30, 2001, which the Company's management has identified as
            being the most current financial statements available;

      2.    reviewed copies of the Agreement;

      3.    met with certain members of the senior management of the Company to
            discuss the operations, financial condition, future prospects and
            projected operations and performance of the Company, and met with
            representatives of the Company's counsel to discuss certain matters;

      4.    visited certain facilities and business offices of the Company;

      5.    reviewed forecasts and projections prepared by the Company's
            management with respect to the Company for the year ended December
            31, 2001;

      6.    reviewed the historical market prices and trading volume for the
            Company's publicly traded securities;

                                      B-1

      7.    reviewed certain other publicly available financial data for certain
            companies that we deem comparable to the Company, and publicly
            available prices and premiums paid in other transactions that we
            considered similar to the Transaction;

      8.    reviewed drafts of certain documents to be delivered at the closing
            of the Transaction; and

      9.    conducted such other studies, analyses and inquiries as we have
            deemed appropriate.

         In giving our Opinion, we have relied upon and assumed, without
independent verification, the accuracy and completeness of all information that
was publicly available or was furnished to us by the Company or otherwise
reviewed by us, and we have not assumed any responsibility or liability
therefore. We have not conducted any valuation or appraisal of any assets or
liabilities, nor have any such valuations or appraisals been provided to us. In
relying on financial forecasts and projections provided to us, we have assumed,
without independent verification, that they have been reasonably prepared based
on assumptions reflecting the best currently available estimates and judgments
by management as to the expected future results of operations and financial
condition of the Company, and that there has been no material change in the
assets, financial condition, business or prospects of the Company since the date
of the most recent financial statements made available to us.

         We have also assumed that the Transaction will be consummated as
described in the Agreement. We have further assumed that the definitive
Agreement will not differ in any material respects from the draft thereof
furnished to us. We have relied as to all legal matters relevant to rendering
our Opinion upon the advice of counsel.

         Our Opinion is necessarily based on economic, market and other
conditions as in effect on, and information made available to us as of, the date
hereof. It should be understood that subsequent developments may affect this
Opinion and that we do not have any obligation to update, revise, or reaffirm
this Opinion. We are expressing no Opinion herein as to the price at which the
shares of Company common stock will trade at any future time.

         This Opinion is provided to the Board of Directors of the Company in
connection with and for the purposes of its evaluation of the Transaction in
accordance with the terms of our engagement letter dated April 5, 2001, and is
not on behalf of, and is not intended to confer rights or remedies upon any
stockholder of the Company or any person other than the Company's Board of
Directors. As you are aware, we will receive a fee in connection with rendering
this Opinion. This Opinion does not constitute a recommendation to any
stockholder of the Company as to how such stockholder should vote with respect
to the Transaction. This Opinion may not be disclosed, referred to, or
communicated (in whole or in part) to any party for any purpose whatsoever
except with our prior written consent in each instance, provided that this
Opinion may be reproduced in full in any proxy or information statement mailed
to stockholders of the Company.

         Based upon the foregoing, and in reliance thereon, it is our Opinion
that the consideration to be received by the stockholders of the Company in
connection with the Transaction is fair to them from a financial point of view.

                                                                APPRAISAL RIGHTS

              SECTION 262 OF THE DELAWARE GENERAL CORPORATION LAW

         (a) Any stockholder of a corporation of this State who holds shares
of stock on the date of the making of a demand pursuant to subsection (d) of
this section with respect to such shares, who continuously holds such shares
through the effective date of the merger or consolidation, who has otherwise
complied with subsection (d) of this section and who has neither voted in
favor of the merger or consolidation nor consented thereto in writing
pursuant to Section 228 of this title shall be entitled to an appraisal by
the Court of Chancery of the fair value of the stockholder's shares of stock
under the circumstances described in subsections (b) and (c) of this section.
As used in this section, the word "stockholder" means a holder of record of
stock in a stock corporation and also a member of record of a nonstock
corporation; the words "stock" and "share" mean and include what is
ordinarily meant by those words and also membership or membership interest of
a member of a nonstock corporation; and the words "depository receipt" mean a
receipt or other instrument issued by a depository representing an interest
in one or more shares, or fractions thereof, solely of stock of a
corporation, which stock is deposited with the depository.

         (b) Appraisal rights shall be available for the shares of any class
or series of stock of a constituent corporation in a merger or consolidation
to be effected pursuant to Section 251 (other than a merger effected pursuant
to Section 251(g) of this title), Section 252, Section 254, Section 257,
Section 258, Section 263 or Section 264 of this title:

                  (1) Provided, however, that no appraisal rights under this
         section shall be available for the shares of any class or series of
         stock, which stock, or depository receipts in respect thereof, at the
         record date fixed to determine the stockholders entitled to receive
         notice of and to vote at the meeting of stockholders to act upon the
         agreement of merger or consolidation, were either (i) listed on a
         national securities exchange or designated as a national market system
         security on an interdealer quotation system by the National Association
         of Securities Dealers, Inc. or (ii) held of record by more than 2,000
         holders; and further provided that no appraisal rights shall be
         available for any shares of stock of the constituent corporation
         surviving a merger if the merger did not require for its approval the
         vote of the stockholders of the surviving corporation as provided in
         subsection (f) of (S)251 of this title.

                  (2) Notwithstanding paragraph (1) of this subsection,
         appraisal rights under this section shall be available for the shares
         of any class or series of stock of a constituent corporation if the
         holders thereof are required by the terms of an agreement of merger or
         consolidation pursuant to Sections 251, 252, 254, 257, 258, 263 and 264
         of this title to accept for such stock anything except:

                  a. Shares of stock of the corporation surviving or resulting
                  from such merger or consolidation, or depository receipts in
                  respect thereof;

                  b. Shares of stock of any other corporation, or depository
                  receipts in respect thereof, which shares of stock (or
                  depository receipts in respect thereof) or depository receipts
                  at the effective date of the merger or consolidation will be
                  either listed on a national securities exchange or designated
                  as a national market system security on an interdealer
                  quotation system by the National Association of Securities
                  Dealers, Inc. or held of record by more than 2,000 holders;

                  c. Cash in lieu of fractional shares or fractional depository
                  receipts described in the foregoing subparagraphs a. and b. of
                  this paragraph; or

                  d. Any combination of the shares of stock, depository receipts
                  and cash in lieu of fractional shares or fractional depository
                  receipts described in the foregoing subparagraphs a., b. and
                  c. of this paragraph.

                  (3) In the event all of the stock of a subsidiary Delaware
         corporation party to a merger effected under Section 253 of this title
         is not owned by the parent corporation immediately prior to the merger,
         appraisal rights shall be available for the shares of the subsidiary
         Delaware corporation.

         (c) Any corporation may provide in its certificate of incorporation
that appraisal rights under this section shall be available for the shares of
any class or series of its stock as a result of an amendment to its certificate
of incorporation, any merger or consolidation in which the corporation is a
constituent corporation or the sale of all or substantially all of the assets of
the corporation. If the certificate of incorporation contains such a provision,
the

                                     C-1

procedures of this section, including those set forth in subsections (d) and
(e) of this section, shall apply as nearly as is practicable.

         (d) Appraisal rights shall be perfected as follows:

                  (1) If a proposed merger or consolidation for which appraisal
         rights are provided under this section is to be submitted for approval
         at a meeting of stockholders, the corporation, not less than 20 days
         prior to the meeting, shall notify each of its stockholders who was
         such on the record date for such meeting with respect to shares for
         which appraisal rights are available pursuant to subsection (b) or (c)
         hereof that appraisal rights are available for any or all of the shares
         of the constituent corporations, and shall include in such notice a
         copy of this section. Each stockholder electing to demand the appraisal
         of such stockholder's shares shall deliver to the corporation, before
         the taking of the vote on the merger or consolidation, a written demand
         for appraisal of such stockholder's shares. Such demand will be
         sufficient if it reasonably informs the corporation of the identity of
         the stockholder and that the stockholder intends thereby to demand the
         appraisal of such stockholder's shares. A proxy or vote against the
         merger or consolidation shall not constitute such a demand. A
         stockholder electing to take such action must do so by a separate
         written demand as herein provided. Within 10 days after the effective
         date of such merger or consolidation, the surviving or resulting
         corporation shall notify each stockholder of each constituent
         corporation who has complied with this subsection and has not voted in
         favor of or consented to the merger or consolidation of the date that
         the merger or consolidation has become effective; or

                  (2) If the merger or consolidation was approved pursuant to
         Section 228 or Section 253 of this title, each constituent corporation,
         either before the effective date of the merger or consolidation or
         within ten days thereafter, shall notify each of the holders of any
         class or series of stock of such constituent corporation who are
         entitled to appraisal rights of the approval of the merger or
         consolidation and that appraisal rights are available for any or all
         shares of such class or series of stock of such constituent
         corporation, and shall include in such notice a copy of this section;
         provided that, if the notice is given on or after the effective date of
         the merger or consolidation, such notice shall be given by the
         surviving or resulting corporation to all such holders of any class or
         series of stock of a constituent corporation that are entitled to
         appraisal rights. Such notice may, and, if given on or after the
         effective date of the merger or consolidation, shall, also notify such
         stockholders of the effective date of the merger or consolidation. Any
         stockholder entitled to appraisal rights may, within 20 days after the
         date of mailing of such notice, demand in writing from the surviving or
         resulting corporation the appraisal of such holder's shares. Such
         demand will be sufficient if it reasonably informs the corporation of
         the identity of the stockholder and that the stockholder intends
         thereby to demand the appraisal of such holder's shares. If such
         notice did not notify stockholders of the effective date of the merger
         or consolidation, either (i) each such constituent corporation shall
         send a second notice before the effective date of the merger or
         consolidation notifying each of the holders of any class or series of
         stock of such constituent corporation that are entitled to appraisal
         rights of the effective date of the merger or consolidation or (ii) the
         surviving or resulting corporation shall send such a second notice to
         all such holders on or within 10 days after such effective date;
         provided, however, that if such second notice is sent more than 20
         days following the sending of the first notice, such second notice
         need only be sent to each stockholder who is entitled to appraisal
         rights and who has demanded appraisal of such holder's shares in
         accordance with this subsection. An affidavit of the secretary or
         assistant secretary or of the transfer agent of the corporation that
         is required to give either notice that such notice has been given
         shall, in the absence of fraud, be prima facie evidence of the facts
         stated therein. For purposes of determining the stockholders entitled
         to receive either notice, each constituent corporation may fix, in
         advance, a record date that shall be not more than 10 days prior to
         the date the notice is given, provided, that if the notice is given
         on or after the effective date of the merger or consolidation, the
         record date shall be such effective date. If no record date is fixed
         and the notice is given prior to the effective date, the record date
         shall be the close of business on the day next preceding the day on
         which the notice is given.

         (e) Within 120 days after the effective date of the merger or
consolidation, the surviving or resulting corporation or any stockholder who has
complied with subsections (a) and (d) hereof and who is otherwise entitled to
appraisal rights, may file a petition in the Court of Chancery demanding a
determination of the value of the stock of all such stockholders.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, at any time within 60 days after the effective
date of the merger or consolidation, any stockholder shall have the right to
withdraw such stockholder's demand for appraisal and to accept the terms offered
upon the merger or consolidation. Within 120 days after the effective date of
the merger or consolidation, any stockholder who has complied with the
requirements of subsections (a) and (d) hereof, upon written request, shall be
entitled to receive from the corporation surviving the merger or resulting from
the consolidation a statement setting forth the aggregate number of shares not
voted in favor of the merger or

                                     C-2

consolidation and with respect to which demands for appraisal have been
received and the aggregate number of holders of such shares. Such written
statement shall be mailed to the stockholder within 10 days after such
stockholder's written request for such a statement is received by the
surviving or resulting corporation or within 10 days after expiration of the
period for delivery of demands for appraisal under subsection (d) hereof,
whichever is later.

         (f) Upon the filing of any such petition by a stockholder, service of a
copy thereof shall be made upon the surviving or resulting corporation, which
shall within 20 days after such service file in the office of the Register in
Chancery in which the petition was filed a duly verified list containing the
names and addresses of all stockholders who have demanded payment for their
shares and with whom agreements as to the value of their shares have not been
reached by the surviving or resulting corporation. If the petition shall be
filed by the surviving or resulting corporation, the petition shall be
accompanied by such a duly verified list. The Register in Chancery, if so
ordered by the Court, shall give notice of the time and place fixed for the
hearing of such petition by registered or certified mail to the surviving or
resulting corporation and to the stockholders shown on the list at the addresses
therein stated. Such notice shall also be given by 1 or more publications at
least 1 week before the day of the hearing, in a newspaper of general
circulation published in the City of Wilmington, Delaware or such publication as
the Court deems advisable. The forms of the notices by mail and by publication
shall be approved by the Court, and the costs thereof shall be borne by the
surviving or resulting corporation.

         (g) At the hearing on such petition, the Court shall determine the
stockholders who have complied with this section and who have become entitled to
appraisal rights. The Court may require the stockholders who have demanded an
appraisal for their shares and who hold stock represented by certificates to
submit their certificates of stock to the Register in Chancery for notation
thereon of the pendency of the appraisal proceedings; and if any stockholder
fails to comply with such direction, the Court may dismiss the proceedings as to
such stockholder.

         (h) After determining the stockholders entitled to an appraisal, the
Court shall appraise the shares, determining their fair value exclusive of any
element of value arising from the accomplishment or expectation of the merger or
consolidation, together with a fair rate of interest, if any, to be paid upon
the amount determined to be the fair value. In determining such fair value, the
Court shall take into account all relevant factors. In determining the fair rate
of interest, the Court may consider all relevant factors, including the rate of
interest which the surviving or resulting corporation would have had to pay to
borrow money during the pendency of the proceeding. Upon application by the
surviving or resulting corporation or by any stockholder entitled to participate
in the appraisal proceeding, the Court may, in its discretion, permit discovery
or other pretrial proceedings and may proceed to trial upon the appraisal prior
to the final determination of the stockholder entitled to an appraisal. Any
stockholder whose name appears on the list filed by the surviving or resulting
corporation pursuant to subsection (f) of this section and who has submitted
such stockholder's certificates of stock to the Register in Chancery, if such is
required, may participate fully in all proceedings until it is finally
determined that such stockholder is not entitled to appraisal rights under this
section.

         (i) The Court shall direct the payment of the fair value of the shares,
together with interest, if any, by the surviving or resulting corporation to the
stockholders entitled thereto. Interest may be simple or compound, as the Court
may direct. Payment shall be so made to each such stockholder, in the case of
holders of uncertificated stock forthwith, and the case of holders of shares
represented by certificates upon the surrender to the corporation of the
certificates representing such stock. The Court's decree may be enforced as
other decrees in the Court of Chancery may be enforced, whether such surviving
or resulting corporation be a corporation of this State or of any state.

         (j) The costs of the proceeding may be determined by the Court and
taxed upon the parties as the Court deems equitable in the circumstances. Upon
application of a stockholder, the Court may order all or a portion of the
expenses incurred by any stockholder in connection with the appraisal
proceeding, including, without limitation, reasonable attorney's fees and the
fees and expenses of experts, to be charged pro rata against the value of all
the shares entitled to an appraisal.

         (k) From and after the effective date of the merger or consolidation,
no stockholder who has demanded appraisal rights as provided in subsection (d)
of this section shall be entitled to vote such stock for any purpose or to
receive payment of dividends or other distributions on the stock (except
dividends or other distributions payable to stockholders of record at a date
which is prior to the effective date of the merger or consolidation); provided,
however, that if no petition for an appraisal shall be filed within the time
provided in subsection (e) of this section, or if such stockholder shall deliver
to the surviving or resulting corporation a written

                                     C-3

withdrawal of such stockholder's demand for an appraisal and an acceptance of
the merger or consolidation, either within 60 days after the effective date
of the merger or consolidation as provided in subsection (e) of this section
or thereafter with the written approval of the corporation, then the right of
such stockholder to an appraisal shall cease. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
no appraisal proceeding in the Court of Chancery shall be dismissed as to any
stockholder without the approval of the Court, and such approval may be
conditioned upon such terms as the Court deems just.

         (l) The shares of the surviving or resulting corporation to which the
shares of such objecting stockholders would have been converted had they
assented to the merger or consolidation shall have the status of authorized and
unissued shares of the surviving or resulting corporation.
