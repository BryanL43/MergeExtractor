                 PROPOSED MERGER -- YOUR VOTE IS VERY IMPORTANT

     Patterson Energy, Inc. and UTI Energy Corp. have agreed on a merger
transaction involving our two companies. Before we can complete the merger, we
must obtain the approval of our companies' stockholders. We are sending you this
joint proxy statement/prospectus to ask you to vote in favor of the merger
transaction and related matters.

     In the merger, stockholders of UTI will be entitled to receive one share of
Patterson common stock in return for each share of UTI common stock they own.
Each outstanding share of Patterson common stock will remain outstanding as a
share of Patterson common stock after the merger. Shares of Patterson common
stock, including shares of Patterson common stock issued to stockholders of UTI
as a result of the merger, will continue to be quoted on the Nasdaq National
Market under the trading symbol "PTEN." Shares of UTI common stock, which are
listed on the American Stock Exchange under the trading symbol "UTI," will be
delisted if the merger is consummated.

     Each of us will hold a special meeting of our stockholders to consider and
vote on the merger proposal. At Patterson's special meeting, Patterson will also
ask its stockholders to consider and vote on amendments to Patterson's restated
certificate of incorporation to increase the authorized shares of Patterson's
common stock from 50,000,000 shares to 200,000,000 shares and to change
Patterson's name to "Patterson-UTI Energy, Inc." At UTI's special meeting, UTI
will ask its stockholders to consider and vote on the merger proposal.
Completion of the merger requires UTI stockholder and Patterson stockholder
adoption of the merger proposal and Patterson stockholder adoption of the
proposal to amend Patterson's restated certificate of incorporation to increase
Patterson's authorized common stock. Approval of the name change is not a
condition to the merger.

     YOUR VOTE IS VERY IMPORTANT. Whether or not you plan to attend your special
meeting, please take the time to vote by completing the enclosed proxy card and
mailing it to us, or Patterson stockholders may vote by following the Internet
or telephone instructions on the proxy card. If you sign, date and mail your
proxy card without indicating how you want to vote, your proxy will be counted
as a vote FOR each of the proposals presented. If you neither return your card
nor vote by Internet or telephone, or if you do not instruct your broker how to
vote any shares held for you in "street name," your shares will not be voted at
your special meeting.

     The respective dates, times, and places of the stockholders' meetings are
as follows:

                     QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS ABOUT THE MERGER

Q:   WHAT WILL HAPPEN IN THE MERGER?

A:   The proposed merger will combine the businesses of Patterson and UTI. As a
     result of the merger, UTI will cease to exist and Patterson will continue
     as a public company. UTI stockholders will become Patterson stockholders
     and will own approximately 49.5% of the shares of Patterson common stock
     outstanding immediately after the merger. Current Patterson stockholders
     will own the approximately 50.5% of the remaining shares of Patterson
     common stock outstanding immediately after the merger. The merger
     agreement, which is a contract between Patterson and UTI, is attached to
     this joint proxy statement/prospectus as Annex A. You should read the
     merger agreement carefully in its entirety because it is the legal document
     setting forth the parties' rights.

Q:   WHY ARE PATTERSON AND UTI PROPOSING THE MERGER?

A:   Our companies are proposing the merger because we believe that the
     combination of the operations and resources of our two companies is an
     excellent strategic fit, and that the combined company will be stronger in
     the short term and long term than either company operating alone.

Q:   WHAT WILL THE NEW COMPANY BE CALLED?

A:   "Patterson-UTI Energy, Inc.," if, at the Patterson special meeting,
     Patterson stockholders approve the proposal to amend Patterson's restated
     certificate of incorporation to change Patterson's name, and if not,
     "Patterson Energy, Inc."

Q:   WHAT WILL HAPPEN TO UTI SHARES, OPTIONS AND WARRANTS IN THE MERGER?

A:   UTI stockholders will receive one share of Patterson common stock for each
     share of UTI common stock they own. The shares of Patterson common stock
     received in the merger will be quoted on the Nasdaq National Market under
     the symbol "PTEN." Options and warrants to purchase UTI common stock will
     be converted into options and warrants to purchase shares of Patterson
     common stock based on the same exchange ratio as applies to the conversion
     of UTI common stock.

Q:   WHAT WILL HAPPEN TO SHARES OF PATTERSON COMMON STOCK IN THE MERGER?

A:   Each outstanding share of Patterson common stock will remain outstanding as
     a share of Patterson common stock.

Q:   WHEN ARE THE SPECIAL STOCKHOLDERS' MEETINGS?

A:   Each company's special meeting of stockholders will take place on
               , 2001. The time and location of each special meeting is
     specified on the cover page of this document.

Q:   WHAT WILL HAPPEN AT THE SPECIAL STOCKHOLDERS' MEETINGS?

A:   At the UTI special meeting, UTI stockholders will vote on the merger
     agreement and the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement,
     including the merger. At the Patterson special meeting, Patterson
     stockholders will vote on the merger agreement and the transactions
     contemplated by the merger agreement and will also vote on a proposal to
     amend Patterson's restated certificate of incorporation to increase the
     authorized shares of Patterson's common stock from 50,000,000 shares to
     200,000,000 shares and on a proposal to amend Patterson's restated
     certificate of incorporation to change Patterson's name to "Patterson-UTI
     Energy, Inc." We cannot complete the merger unless, among other things,
     Patterson stockholders vote to adopt the merger agreement and the amendment
     to the restated certificate of incorporation to increase the authorized
     shares of Patterson's common stock. Approval of the name change is not
     necessary to permit consummation of the merger.

Q:   WHAT DO I NEED TO DO TO VOTE?

A:   Mail your signed proxy card in the enclosed return envelope or, in the case
     of Patterson stockholders, you may vote by Internet or by telephone in each
     case as soon as possible so that your shares may be represented at your
     special meeting. In order to assure that we obtain your vote, please vote
     as instructed on your proxy card even if you currently plan to attend your
     special meeting in person.

     THE MEMBERS OF THE UTI BOARD OF DIRECTORS UNANIMOUSLY RECOMMEND THAT UTI
     STOCKHOLDERS VOTE FOR ADOPTION OF THE MERGER AGREEMENT AND APPROVAL OF THE
     TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED BY THE MERGER AGREEMENT, INCLUDING THE MERGER.

     THE MEMBERS OF THE PATTERSON BOARD OF DIRECTORS RECOMMEND THAT PATTERSON
     STOCKHOLDERS VOTE FOR ADOPTION OF THE MERGER AGREEMENT AND APPROVAL OF THE
     TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED BY THE MERGER AGREEMENT, INCLUDING THE MERGER,
     AND THE RESPECTIVE AMENDMENTS TO PATTERSON'S RESTATED CERTIFICATE OF
     INCORPORATION TO INCREASE THE AUTHORIZED SHARES OF PATTERSON COMMON STOCK
     AND TO EFFECT THE NAME CHANGE. ONE OF PATTERSON'S DIRECTORS ABSTAINED FROM
     VOTING ON THE MERGER BECAUSE OF HIS BELIEF THAT HE DID NOT HAVE SUFFICIENT
     INFORMATION AND TIME TO MAKE AN INFORMED DECISION.

Q:   ARE THERE RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH THE MERGER THAT I SHOULD CONSIDER IN
     DECIDING HOW TO VOTE?

A:   Yes. There are risks associated with all business combinations, including
     the merger of our two companies. In particular, you should be aware that
     the number of shares of Patterson common stock that UTI stockholders will
     receive is fixed and will not change as the market prices of UTI common
     stock and Patterson common stock fluctuate in the period before the merger.
     Accordingly, the value of the Patterson common stock that UTI stockholders
     will receive in return for their UTI common stock may be less than or more
     than the value of the Patterson common stock as of the date of the merger
     agreement or the date of this joint proxy statement/prospectus. There are a
     number of other risks that are discussed in this document and in other
     documents incorporated by reference in this document. PLEASE READ WITH
     PARTICULAR CARE THE MORE DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH
     THE MERGER DISCUSSED UNDER "RISK FACTORS" ON PAGE 19.

Q:   WHEN DO YOU EXPECT TO COMPLETE THE MERGER?

A:   We expect to complete the merger as quickly as possible once all the
     conditions to the merger, including obtaining the approvals of our
     stockholders at the special meetings, are fulfilled or waived. Fulfilling
     some of these conditions, such as receiving certain governmental clearances
     or approvals, is not entirely within our control. We expect to complete the
     merger in the second quarter of 2001.

Q:   SHOULD I SEND IN MY UTI STOCK CERTIFICATES NOW?

A:   No. After the merger is completed, we will send written instructions to UTI
     stockholders that explain how to exchange UTI stock certificates for
     Patterson stock certificates. We will also send a letter of transmittal
     that must be executed by UTI stockholders. Please do not send in any UTI
     stock certificates until you receive these written instructions and the
     letter of transmittal.

Q:   HOW DO I VOTE MY SHARES IF MY SHARES ARE HELD IN "STREET NAME"?

A:   You should vote this proxy in accordance with the instructions provided to
     you by your broker. Your broker will not vote your shares unless the broker
     receives appropriate instructions from you.

Q:   MAY I CHANGE MY VOTE EVEN AFTER RETURNING A PROXY CARD?

A:   Yes. If you are a UTI stockholder and want to change your vote, you may do
     so at any time before the UTI special meeting by sending to the Secretary
     of UTI a proxy with a later date. Alternatively, you may revoke your proxy
     by delivering to the Secretary of UTI a written revocation prior to the UTI
     special meeting or by voting in person at the UTI special meeting.
     Similarly,

     if you are a Patterson stockholder and want to change your vote, you may do
     so at any time before the Patterson special meeting by sending to the
     Secretary of Patterson a proxy with a later date. Alternatively, you may
     revoke your proxy by delivering to the Secretary of Patterson a written
     revocation prior to the Patterson special meeting or by voting in person at
     the Patterson special meeting. UTI stockholders that require assistance in
     changing or revoking a proxy should contact Mellon Investor Services LLC,
     UTI's transfer agent for the merger, at (214) 922-4400. Patterson
     stockholders that require assistance in changing or revoking a proxy should
     contact Michael Nelson at Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company,
     Patterson's transfer agent for the merger, at (212) 509-4000.

Q:   WILL UTI STOCKHOLDERS BE ABLE TO TRADE THE PATTERSON COMMON STOCK THAT THEY
     RECEIVE IN THE MERGER?

A:   Yes. The Patterson common stock will be quoted on the Nasdaq National
     Market under the symbol "PTEN." However, persons who are affiliates of UTI
     will not be able to sell the Patterson common stock received in the merger
     unless they comply with Rule 145 under the Securities Act and certain
     restrictions under accounting rules relating to pooling-of-interests
     accounting treatment. Affiliates of Patterson will also be restricted under
     the pooling-of-interests accounting rules. Pursuant to the merger
     agreement, these persons have signed agreements acknowledging these
     restrictions.

Q:   WHAT HAPPENS IF I CHOOSE NOT TO SUBMIT A PROXY OR TO VOTE?

A:   If a UTI stockholder does not submit a proxy or vote at the UTI special
     stockholder meeting, it will have the same effect as a vote against
     adoption and approval of the merger agreement and the merger. If a
     Patterson stockholder does not submit a proxy or vote at the Patterson
     special stockholder meeting, it will have the same effect as a vote against
     the adoption and approval of the merger agreement and the merger and
     against the respective amendments to Patterson's restated certificate of
     incorporation.

Q:   WHAT ARE THE FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSEQUENCES OF THE MERGER?

A:   The merger is conditioned on the receipt of an opinion from Baker &
     Hostetler LLP to Patterson and an opinion from Fulbright & Jaworski L.L.P.
     to UTI that the merger qualifies as a reorganization within the meaning of
     Section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. If the
     merger so qualifies, no gain or loss will be recognized by UTI's
     stockholders or UTI as a result of the merger. In addition, Patterson's
     stockholders and Patterson will not recognize gain or loss as a result of
     the merger.

     Tax matters are complicated, and the federal income tax consequences
     described above may not apply to some of UTI's stockholders. The tax
     consequences of the proposed transactions to you will depend on the facts
     of your own situation. You should consult your own tax advisors for a full
     understanding of the tax consequences to you of the merger.

Q:   AM I ENTITLED TO APPRAISAL RIGHTS?

A:   No. Neither holders of shares of UTI common stock nor holders of shares of
     Patterson common stock are entitled to appraisal rights in connection with
     the merger.

Q:   WILL THE RIGHTS OF A UTI STOCKHOLDER CHANGE AS A RESULT OF THE MERGER?

A:   Yes. Through the date of the merger, Patterson stockholder rights will
     continue to be governed by Patterson's restated certificate of
     incorporation and bylaws, and UTI stockholder rights will continue to be
     governed by UTI's restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws. Upon
     completion of the merger, UTI stockholders will become Patterson
     stockholders and their rights will then be governed by Patterson's restated
     certificate of incorporation and bylaws. Please read carefully the summary
     of the material differences between the rights of Patterson stockholders
     and UTI stockholders under the

     heading "Comparison of Stockholders' Rights."

Q:   IF I HAVE MORE QUESTIONS ABOUT THE MERGER OR THE TWO COMPANIES, WHERE CAN I
     FIND ANSWERS?

A:   In addition to reading this document, its annexes, and the documents we
     have incorporated in this document by reference, you can find more
     information about the merger or about the two companies in our companies'
     filings with the SEC and, in the case of Patterson, with the Nasdaq

RECORD DATE; VOTE REQUIRED

  UTI STOCKHOLDERS

     You can vote at the UTI special meeting if you owned shares of UTI common
stock at the close of business on March 13, 2001. On that date, there were
          shares of UTI common stock outstanding and entitled to vote. You can
cast one vote for each share of UTI common stock you then owned. Adoption of the
merger agreement and approval of the transactions contemplated by the merger
agreement, including the merger, requires the approval of the holders of a
majority of the outstanding shares of UTI common stock. Abstentions and broker
non-votes will be the equivalent of a "no" vote on the adoption of the merger
agreement and the approval of the transactions contemplated by the merger
agreement.

     As of March 13, 2001, UTI directors and executive officers have the right
to vote approximately      % of the outstanding shares of UTI common stock.
These individuals have indicated that they intend to vote in favor of the merger
proposal.

  PATTERSON STOCKHOLDERS

     You can vote at the Patterson special meeting if you owned shares of
Patterson common stock at the close of business on March 13, 2001. On that date,
there were           shares of Patterson common stock outstanding and entitled
to vote. You may cast one vote for each share of Patterson common stock you then
owned. Adoption of:

     - the merger agreement and approval of the transactions contemplated by the

       change Patterson's name requires the adoption of the holders of a
       majority of the outstanding shares of Patterson common stock.

adoption of the merger agreement and the respective amendments to Patterson's
restated certificate of incorporation. Approval of the proposal to amend
Patterson's restated certificate of incorporation to increase the authorized
shares of Patterson common stock is a prerequisite to the adoption of the merger
agreement.

     As of March 13, 2001, Patterson directors and executive officers have the
right to vote approximately      % of the outstanding shares of Patterson common
stock. These individuals have indicated that they intend to vote in favor of the

THE MERGER (PAGE 27)

  GENERAL

     On February 5, 2001, we announced that the boards of directors of our
companies had approved a merger of our two companies. When the merger is
completed, each holder of shares of UTI common stock will receive one share of
Patterson common stock. The name of the company following the merger is expected
to be "Patterson-UTI Energy, Inc." The consummation of the merger is subject to
customary conditions, including approval of the stockholders of both companies
and necessary regulatory approvals, and other terms and provisions that are set
forth in the merger agreement. The merger agreement is attached as Annex A to
this document. Please read carefully the merger agreement. The merger agreement
is the legal document that governs the merger.

  EXCHANGE OF COMMON STOCK

     When the merger is completed, all shares of outstanding UTI common stock
will be converted into shares of Patterson common stock.

     UTI Stockholders.  Each share of UTI common stock held prior to the
effective time of the merger will be converted into the right to receive one
share of Patterson common stock. At the effective time of the merger, Patterson
will assume each UTI option outstanding at that time under UTI's employee stock
option plan, non-employee director stock option plan, long term incentive plan
and an employee stock option plan that UTI assumed in a 1999 acquisition. Each
assumed UTI option will become an option to acquire, on the same basis and
conditions, one share of Patterson common stock at the same exercise price.
Patterson will also assume each UTI warrant outstanding at the effective time.
Each assumed UTI warrant will become a warrant to acquire, on the same terms and
conditions, one share of Patterson common stock at the same exercise price.

     Former UTI stockholders will own approximately 49.5% of the shares of
Patterson-UTI common stock outstanding immediately after the merger, without
giving consideration to shares of Patterson common stock issuable upon exercise
of UTI options and warrants to be assumed by Patterson as a part of the merger.

     Patterson Stockholders.  Each share of Patterson common stock will remain
issued and outstanding as one share of Patterson common stock. Holders of shares
of Patterson common stock immediately prior to the merger will own approximately
50.5% of the Patterson-UTI common stock outstanding immediately after the
merger, without giving consideration to shares of Patterson common stock
issuable upon exercise of UTI options and warrants to be assumed by Patterson as
a part of the merger.

  OUR RECOMMENDATIONS TO STOCKHOLDERS

     UTI Stockholders.  (Page 29) The UTI board of directors believes that the
merger is fair to you and in your best interests, and it unanimously recommends
that you vote for the proposal to adopt the merger agreement and approve the
transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, including the merger.

     Patterson Stockholders.  (Page 36) The Patterson board of directors
believes that the merger is fair to you and in your best interests, and it
recommends that you vote for the proposal to adopt the merger agreement and
approve the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, including the
merger, and for the respective proposals to amend Patterson's restated
certificate of incorporation to increase the number of shares of authorized
Patterson common stock and to change Patterson's name. One of Patterson's board
members abstained from voting on these matters due to his belief that he did not
have sufficient information and time to make an informed decision.

  OPINIONS OF FINANCIAL ADVISORS

     In deciding to recommend the merger, our boards of directors considered
opinions from our respective financial advisors.

     UTI Financial Advisor.  (Page 30) UTI's board of directors received a
written opinion from its financial advisor, Lehman Brothers Inc., to the effect
that as of the date of the opinion, the exchange ratio of one share of Patterson
common stock for each share of UTI common stock is fair to holders of UTI common
stock from a financial point of view. We have attached this opinion dated
February 4, 2001, as Annex B to this document. You should carefully read this
opinion to understand the procedures followed, assumptions made, matters
considered and limitations of the review undertaken.

     Lehman Brothers' opinion is addressed to the UTI board of directors and
does not constitute a recommendation to any stockholder as to how any
stockholder should vote in connection with the merger proposal.

     Patterson Financial Advisor.  (Page 36) Patterson's board of directors
received a written opinion from its financial advisor, Merrill Lynch & Co., to
the effect that as of the date of the opinion, the

exchange ratio of one share of Patterson common stock for each share of UTI
common stock is fair to the Patterson stockholders from a financial point of
view. We have attached the opinion dated February 4, 2001, as Annex C to this
document. You should carefully read this opinion to understand the procedures
followed, assumptions made, matters considered and limitations of the review
undertaken.

     Merrill Lynch's opinion is addressed to the Patterson board of directors
and does not constitute a recommendation to any stockholder as to how any
stockholder should vote in connection with the merger proposal.

  BOARD OF DIRECTORS AND MANAGEMENT OF PATTERSON-UTI FOLLOWING THE MERGER (PAGE
43)

     If the merger agreement is adopted and the transactions contemplated by the
merger agreement, including the merger, are approved, the number of directors
comprising the full board of directors of Patterson-UTI will be increased to 11
members, with six members to be designated by the Patterson board and five
members to be designated by the UTI board. These directors will serve until the
2002 annual meeting of Patterson-UTI stockholders or until their respective
successors are elected and qualified. The merger agreement does not specify who
will be Chairman of the Board and the executive officers of Patterson-UTI
following the merger. Formal action with respect to these positions will be
taken by the new UTI-Patterson board of directors promptly following closing of
the merger. At the time that our boards of directors approved the merger
agreement, they anticipated that Mark S. Siegel, Chairman of the Board of UTI,
would be the Chairman of the Board of Patterson-UTI and that Cloyce A. Talbott,
Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer of Patterson, would be the
Chief Executive Officer of Patterson-UTI.

  CONDITIONS TO COMPLETION OF THE MERGER (PAGE 52)

     Completion of the merger depends on a number of conditions being satisfied
or waived. In addition to customary conditions relating to the accuracy of
representations and warranties and our compliance with the terms of the merger
agreement, these conditions include the following:

     - the merger agreement and the merger have been approved and adopted by
       UTI's stockholders and Patterson's stockholders, and the amendment to
       Patterson's restated certificate of incorporation to authorize additional
       shares of Patterson common stock has been approved by Patterson's
       stockholders;

     - any applicable waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust
       Improvements Act of 1976 relating to the merger has expired or has been
       terminated;

     - no governmental entity or federal, state or foreign court of competent
       jurisdiction has enacted, issued, promulgated, enforced or entered any
       order or statute, rule or regulation that is in effect and that has the
       effect of making the merger illegal or otherwise prohibiting the
       consummation of the merger; and

     - Patterson and UTI each has received an opinion of tax counsel to the
       effect that the merger will be treated for federal income tax purposes as
       a tax-free reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the
       Internal Revenue Code.

  TERMINATION OF THE MERGER (PAGE 52)

     We can agree at any time to terminate the merger agreement without
completing the merger, even if UTI and Patterson stockholders have approved the
merger and Patterson stockholders also have approved the amendment to
Patterson's restated certificate of incorporation to increase the authorized
shares of Patterson common stock. Also, the merger agreement can be terminated
under various circumstances, including the following:

     - by UTI and Patterson, at any time prior to the effective time of the
       merger, with the mutual written consent of our respective boards of
       directors;

     - by either of us, if the merger has not been completed by June 30, 2001,
       except that the right to terminate the merger agreement under this
       provision is not available to any party whose failure to fulfill any of
       its obligations under the merger agreement was the cause of or resulted
       in the failure of the merger to occur on or before June 30, 2001;
       provided, that if either of us determines that additional time is
       necessary in connection with obtaining any governmental consents, that
       date may be extended by either of us to August 31, 2001;

     - by either of us, if any order permanently restraining, enjoining or
       otherwise prohibiting consummation of the merger shall become final and
       nonappealable;

     - by either of us, if, at UTI's stockholders' meeting, UTI does not obtain
       the requisite vote of its stockholders in favor of the merger, or if, at
       Patterson's stockholders' meeting, the requisite vote approving the
       merger agreement and merger or the amendment to Patterson's restated
       certificate of incorporation to increase the authorized shares of common
       stock is not obtained;

     - by either of us, if, there has been a breach of any representation,
       warranty, covenant or agreement set forth in the merger agreement on the
       part of the other party, which breach cannot be cured and would cause the
       closing conditions relating to our respective representations and
       warranties and performance of our respective obligations not to be
       satisfied;

     - by UTI, if the board of directors of UTI authorizes UTI to enter into a
       written agreement relating to a transaction that UTI's board of directors
       has determined is a superior proposal compared to the merger, so long as
       UTI is not in material breach of its obligation not to solicit other
       merger proposals and so long as UTI's stockholders have not approved the
       merger, except that this right to terminate is not available to UTI until
       the expiration of five business days after Patterson's receipt of written
       notice advising that UTI has received a superior proposal and attaching
       the most current version of such agreement, and the failure on the part
       of Patterson to submit an offer that the UTI board determines in good
       faith to be at least as favorable to the UTI stockholders as the superior
       proposal;

     - by Patterson, if the board of directors of Patterson authorizes Patterson
       to enter into a written agreement relating to a transaction that the
       Patterson board of directors has determined is a superior proposal
       compared to the merger, so long as Patterson is not in material breach of
       its obligation not to solicit other merger proposals and so long as
       Patterson's stockholders have not approved the merger, except that the
       right to terminate is not available to Patterson until the expiration of
       five business days after UTI's receipt of written notice advising that
       Patterson has received a superior proposal and attaching the most current
       version of such agreement, and the failure on the part of UTI to submit
       an offer that the Patterson board determines in good faith to be at least
       as favorable to the Patterson stockholders as the superior proposal;

     - by Patterson, if the merger is not approved by the UTI stockholders and
       Patterson is not in breach of the merger agreement, Patterson has not
       entered into a superior proposal and its board of directors has not
       withdrawn, modified or failed to confirm its recommendation of the merger
       within five business days after a written request from UTI to do so; and

     - by UTI, if the merger is not approved by the Patterson stockholders and
       UTI is not in breach of the merger agreement and UTI has not entered into
       a superior proposal and its board of directors has not withdrawn,
       modified or failed to confirm its recommendation of the merger within
       five business days after a written request from Patterson to do so.

  TERMINATION FEES (PAGE 53)

     Patterson must pay UTI a termination fee of $32.5 million and up to $2.5
million of the costs and expenses incurred by UTI in connection with the merger
agreement, if Patterson enters into a binding agreement for a superior proposal
and has complied with the terms of the merger agreement, or, if an acquisition
proposal has been made to Patterson and the merger agreement is terminated by
either UTI or

Patterson because of the failure to obtain approval of the merger by Patterson's
stockholders at the Patterson stockholders' meeting.

     Similarly, UTI must pay Patterson a termination fee of $32.5 million and up
to $2.5 million of the costs and expenses incurred by Patterson in connection
with the merger agreement, if UTI enters into a binding agreement for a superior
proposal and has complied with the terms of the merger agreement, or, if an
acquisition proposal has been made to UTI and the merger agreement is terminated
by either Patterson or UTI because of the failure to obtain approval of the
merger by UTI's stockholders at the UTI stockholders' meeting.

     Patterson must pay UTI a termination fee of $2.5 million and up to $2.5
million of costs and expenses incurred by UTI in connection with the merger
agreement, if Patterson stockholders do not approve the merger and the amendment
to Patterson's restated certificate of incorporation increasing the authorized
shares of Patterson common stock, and UTI is not otherwise in default under the
merger agreement or has not entered into an agreement for a superior proposal.

     UTI must pay Patterson a termination fee of $2.5 million and up to $2.5
million of costs and expenses incurred by Patterson in connection with the
merger agreement if UTI stockholders do not approve the merger, and Patterson is
not otherwise in default under the merger agreement or has not entered into an
agreement for a superior proposal.

  ACCOUNTING TREATMENT (PAGE 42)

     We intend to account for the merger as a pooling-of-interests for financial
reporting purposes. Under this method of accounting, the recorded assets and
liabilities of Patterson and UTI will be carried forward to Patterson-UTI, the
combined company, at their historical amounts, and income of Patterson-UTI will
include income of Patterson and UTI for the entire fiscal year in which the
merger occurs as well as for prior periods.

  INTERESTS OF CERTAIN PERSONS IN THE MERGER THAT ARE DIFFERENT FROM YOUR
INTERESTS (PAGE 41)

     Patterson.  All employee stock options outstanding under Patterson's 1993
stock incentive plan, including those held by the executive officers of
Patterson, will vest at closing of the merger, due to the change in control
provisions in the plan.

     UTI.  All outstanding stock options held by Mark Siegel, Vaughn Drum, John
Vollmer and Bruce Sauers, executive officers of UTI, and one of UTI's directors,
Kenneth Berns, will vest at the closing of the merger due to change of control
provisions in their respective option agreements. In addition, four other UTI
employees hold stock options to purchase an aggregate of less than 65,000 shares
of UTI common stock that will vest at the closing of the merger.

     Three of UTI's directors and officers, Messrs. Siegel, Berns and Vollmer,
have employment arrangements with UTI that also will entitle them to receive a
payment equal to one year's salary upon a change of control in UTI and the
cessation of their employment arrangements. UTI's President and Chief Executive
Officer, Vaughn E. Drum, has an employment agreement with UTI that provides that
if his employment is terminated without cause (as that term is defined in his
employment agreement) or if he voluntarily terminates his employment within one
year of an adverse change (a significant reduction of his authority, duties or
responsibilities, his removal from office, a reduction in his salary or material
reduction in benefits, or a transfer without his consent to a location greater
than 40 miles from his previous work location), he would receive compensation
comprising one year's salary, up to one-half of one year's salary as separation
pay, vacation pay, any bonus, full vesting of all of his interests under benefit
plans and continuation of his benefits.

  APPRAISAL RIGHTS (PAGE 43)

     Under Delaware law, neither the Patterson stockholders nor the UTI
stockholders are entitled to appraisal rights in connection with the merger.

  CERTAIN UNITED STATES FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSEQUENCES (PAGE 44)

     A condition to each party's obligation to complete the merger is receipt of
an opinion from its tax counsel that the merger will qualify as a reorganization
within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as
amended. These opinions will be based on customary assumptions and
representations made by Patterson and UTI. If any of these assumptions or
representations are inaccurate, the tax consequences of the merger could differ
from those described below. An opinion of counsel represents counsel's best
legal judgment and is not binding on the Internal Revenue Service or any court.
No ruling has been, or will be, sought from the Internal Revenue Service as to
the U.S. federal income tax consequences of the merger.

     UTI Stockholders and UTI.  If the merger is classified as a reorganization
within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code, a holder of
shares of UTI common stock generally will not recognize any gain or loss for
U.S. federal income tax purposes on the exchange of shares of UTI common stock
for shares of Patterson common stock, and UTI will not recognize gain or loss
for U.S. federal income tax purposes.

     The U.S. federal income tax consequences described above may not apply to
some holders of shares of UTI common stock, including some types of holders
specifically referred to on page 44.

     Patterson Stockholders and Patterson.  Patterson and holders of shares of
Patterson common stock will not recognize any gain or loss for U.S. federal
income tax purposes.

     Your tax consequences will depend on your specific situation. You should
consult your own tax advisor for a full understanding of the tax consequences of
the merger to you.

  CERTAIN DIFFERENCES IN THE RIGHTS OF STOCKHOLDERS (PAGE 85)

     As a result of the merger, the stockholders of UTI will become stockholders
of Patterson. Upon consummation of the merger, these rights of UTI stockholders
will continue to be governed by the Delaware General Corporation Law, but their
rights will also be governed by Patterson's restated certificate of
incorporation and bylaws. See page 85 for summaries of certain material
differences between the rights of Patterson stockholders and UTI stockholders.

  REGULATORY APPROVALS (PAGE 42)

     Under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, we may not
complete the merger unless Patterson, UTI and REMY Capital Partners III, L.P., a
stockholder of UTI, file Notification and Report Forms with the Antitrust
Division of the Department of Justice and the U.S. Federal Trade Commission and
certain waiting periods expire or terminate. On February 22, 2001, Patterson,
UTI and REMY Capital submitted the required filings to the Federal Trade
Commission and the Antitrust Division. The waiting period under the
Hart-Scott-Rodino Act will expire on March 26, 2001, unless each party receives
early termination of the waiting period before that time. The waiting period
under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act may be extended by receipt of a request for
additional information or documentary material from either the Antitrust
Division or the Federal Trade Commission until the expiration of 30 days after
both Patterson and UTI are in substantial compliance with that request (unless
the extended waiting period is terminated early). We cannot predict whether the
Federal Trade Commission or the Antitrust Division will challenge the merger on
antitrust grounds, or, if such a challenge is made, what the result will be.

  COMPARATIVE PER SHARE MARKET PRICE INFORMATION (PAGE 18)

     Patterson's common stock is quoted on the Nasdaq National Market and UTI's
common stock is listed on the American Stock Exchange. On February 2, 2001, the
last full trading day prior to public announcement of the merger, Patterson's
common stock closed at $36.00 per share and the UTI common stock closed at
$33.10 per share. On           , 2001, the most recent practicable date prior to
mailing this

document, Patterson's common stock closed at $     per share and the UTI common
stock closed at $     per share.

     Although the exchange ratio is fixed, the market price of Patterson common
stock will fluctuate prior to and after the merger. We urge you to obtain
current market quotations before making any decision with respect to the merger.

(1) Over the five years presented, UTI's rig fleet has increased by 89 land
    drilling rigs. This increase in land drilling rigs is the primary cause for
    the increase in revenue, gross profit, selling, general and administrative
    expenses, depreciation and amortization and total assets. The net change in
    land

    drilling rigs owned was 19 during 2000, 16 during 1999, 20 during 1998, 24
    during 1997 and 10 during 1996.

(2) UTI recognized a $2.8 million gain from the sale of land drilling assets in
    the first quarter of 1999.

(3) In October of 1997, UTI sold approximately 3.6 million shares of its common
    stock in a public offering. Approximately another 3.4 million shares of UTI
    common stock were sold by various shareholders of UTI through the exercise
    of options and warrants. Both of these events resulted in net proceeds to
    UTI of approximately $80 million.

(1) Over the five years presented, Patterson's rig fleet has increased by 104
    land drilling rigs. This increase in land drilling rigs is the primary cause
    for the increase in revenue, gross profit, selling,

general and administrative expenses, depreciation and amortization and total
assets. The net change in land drilling rigs owned was 12 during 2000, five
during 1999, 15 during 1998, 38 during 1997 and 34 during 1996.

(2) Patterson incurred $2.3 of non-recurring acquisition costs associated with
    its merger with Tucker Drilling Company, Inc. during 1996.

(3) In 1997 and 2000, Patterson sold 7.1 million shares and three million
    shares, respectively, of its common stock in two public offerings. These two
    offerings resulted in net proceeds to Patterson of approximately $59.4
    million and $98.8 million in 1997 and 2000, respectively.

              SELECTED UNAUDITED PRO FORMA COMBINED FINANCIAL DATA
                                OF PATTERSON-UTI

     The following tables set forth selected unaudited pro forma combined
financial data to give effect to the merger between Patterson and UTI based on
the pooling-of-interests method of accounting at the exchange ratio of one share
of Patterson common stock for each share of UTI common stock. The unaudited pro
forma balance sheet data included in the tables below are presented as if the
merger was effective on December 31, 2000. The unaudited pro forma statement of
operations data included in the tables below are presented as though the merger
was effective as of January 1, 1998. The pro forma amounts in the tables below
are presented for informational purposes. You should not rely on the pro forma
amounts as being indicative of the financial position or the results of
operations of the combined company that would have actually occurred had the
merger been effective during the periods presented or of the future financial
position or future results of operations of the combined company. The unaudited
pro forma combined statements of operations exclude non-recurring charges
directly attributable to the merger (estimated at $10 million), substantially
all of which will be charged to operations in the quarter in which the merger is
consummated. The unaudited pro forma combined balance sheet has been adjusted to
reflect the assumed after-tax impact of such non-recurring charges. You should
read this information in conjunction with the historical consolidated financial
statements and accompanying notes of Patterson and UTI incorporated in this
document by reference and the condensed unaudited pro forma combined financial
statements and notes beginning on page 79.

     The following table sets forth certain historical per share data for
Patterson and UTI and unaudited pro forma combined and unaudited equivalent pro
forma per share data for Patterson-UTI after giving effect to the proposed
merger under the pooling-of-interests method of accounting at the exchange ratio
of one share of Patterson common stock for each share of UTI common stock. You
should read this data in conjunction with the selected historical consolidated
financial and operating data and the unaudited pro forma combined financial
statements included in this document, as well as the separate historical
consolidated financial statements of Patterson and UTI and the notes thereto
incorporated by reference in this document. The pro forma combined per share
data in the table below are presented for informational purposes. You should not
rely on the pro forma amounts as being indicative of the financial position or
the results of operations of the combined company that would have actually
occurred had the merger been effective during the periods presented or of the
future financial position or future results of operations of the combined
company.

(1) The unaudited equivalent pro forma per share data is calculated by
    multiplying the unaudited pro forma combined per share data by the exchange
    ratio of one share of Patterson common stock for each share of UTI common
    stock.

(2) Historical book value per share is computed by dividing stockholders' equity
    by the number of shares of common stock outstanding at the end of the
    period.

                                  RISK FACTORS

     In deciding whether to approve the merger between UTI and Patterson, you
should consider all of the information we have included in this document and its
annexes and all of the information we have included in the documents we have
incorporated by reference. See "Where You Can Find More Information" on page 94.
In addition, you should pay particular attention to the following risks related
to the merger:

WE MAY NOT REALIZE THE BENEFITS OF INTEGRATING THE TWO COMPANIES.

     In deciding that the merger is in the best interests of our respective
stockholders, the Patterson board of directors and the UTI board of directors
considered the potential complementary effects of combining the two companies'
assets, personnel and operational expertise. Integrating businesses, however,
involves a number of special risks, including the possibility that management
may be distracted from regular business concerns by the need to integrate
operations, unforeseen difficulties in integrating operations and systems,
problems concerning retaining and assimilating the employees of the combined
company, challenges in retaining customers, and potential adverse short-term or
long-term effects on operating results. If we cannot integrate our businesses
successfully, we may fail to realize the benefits we expect to realize from the
merger, including cost savings.

THE MARKET VALUE OF SHARES OF PATTERSON COMMON STOCK THAT UTI STOCKHOLDERS
RECEIVE IN THE MERGER WILL VARY AS A RESULT OF THE FIXED EXCHANGE RATIO AND
POSSIBLE STOCK PRICE FLUCTUATIONS.

     The exchange ratio is a fixed ratio that will not be adjusted as a result
of any increase or decrease in the price of either shares of Patterson common
stock or shares of UTI common stock. The prices of Patterson common stock and
UTI common stock at the time the merger is completed may be higher or lower than
their price on the date of this document or on the date of the special meetings
of UTI stockholders and Patterson stockholders. Changes in the business,
operations or prospects of Patterson or UTI, market assessments of the benefits
of the merger and of the likelihood that the merger will be completed,
regulatory considerations, oil and gas prices, general market and economic
conditions, or other factors may affect the prices of Patterson common stock or
UTI common stock. Most of these factors are beyond our control.

     Because the merger will be completed only after the special meetings of our
respective stockholders are held, there is no way to be sure that the price of
the Patterson common stock now, or on the date of the special meetings, will be
indicative of its price at the time the merger is completed. We urge you to
obtain current market quotations for both shares of Patterson common stock and
shares of UTI common stock.

SIGNIFICANT CHARGES AND EXPENSES WILL BE INCURRED AS A RESULT OF THE MERGER.

     We expect to incur approximately $10 million of costs related to the
merger. These expenses will include, investment banking fees, legal and
accounting fees, printing costs, regulatory filing fees, transition and
integration costs and other related charges. We may also incur unanticipated
costs in the merger.

A SUBSTANTIAL OR EXTENDED DECLINE IN OIL OR GAS PRICES WOULD HAVE A MATERIAL
ADVERSE EFFECT ON PATTERSON-UTI.

     Prices for oil and natural gas fluctuate widely. Among the factors that can
cause these price fluctuations are:

     - level of consumer demand,

     - weather conditions,

     - price and availability of alternative fuels,

     - domestic and Canadian drilling activity, and

     - overall economic conditions.

     Due to the many uncertainties associated with the world political
environment, the availability of other worldwide energy supplies and the
relative competitive relationships of the various energy sources in the view of
consumers, we are unable to predict what changes may occur in oil and natural
gas prices in the future.

     Our cash flow and earnings depend to a great extent on the prevailing
prices for oil and natural gas. Prolonged or substantial declines in these
commodity prices may adversely affect our liquidity, the amount of cash flow
available for capital expenditures, and our ability to maintain our credit
quality and access to the credit and capital markets.

PATTERSON-UTI WILL HAVE HIGHER LEVELS OF INDEBTEDNESS THAN EITHER PATTERSON OR
UTI HAD BEFORE THE MERGER.

     You should consider that Patterson-UTI would have higher levels of debt and
interest expense than either company on a stand-alone basis. The level of
combined indebtedness after the merger may have an effect on our future
operations, including:

     - A portion of Patterson-UTI's cash flow will be used to pay interest and
       principal on debt and will not be available for other purposes;

     - Patterson-UTI's credit facilities may contain financial tests that it
       must satisfy in order to continue to borrow funds under the facilities.
       Failure to meet these tests may be a default under the credit facilities;
       and

     - Patterson-UTI may be unable to adjust rapidly to changing market
       conditions.

ANTI-TAKEOVER MEASURES IN PATTERSON'S CHARTER DOCUMENTS AND UNDER STATE LAW
COULD DISCOURAGE AN ACQUISITION OF PATTERSON-UTI AND THEREBY ADVERSELY AFFECT
THE RELATED PURCHASE PRICE.

     Patterson, as a Delaware corporation, is subject to the Delaware General
Corporation Law, including Section 203, an anti-takeover law enacted in 1988.
Patterson has also enacted certain anti-takeover measures, including a
stockholders' rights plan. In addition, Patterson's board of directors has the
authority to issue up to one million shares of preferred stock and to determine
the price, rights (including voting rights), conversion ratios, preferences and
privileges of that stock without further vote or action by the holders of its
common stock. As a result of these measures and the rights plan described below,
potential acquirers of Patterson-UTI may find it more difficult or be
discouraged from attempting to effect an acquisition transaction with us. This
could deprive holders of Patterson-UTI securities of certain opportunities to
sell or otherwise dispose of such securities at above-market prices and could
discourage transactions involving actual and potential changes of control,
including transactions that otherwise could result in a payment of a premium
over prevailing market prices to Patterson-UTI stockholders for shares of
Patterson-UTI common stock.

     Patterson's board of directors adopted a stockholders' rights plan in
January 1997. The existence of the rights plan may impede a takeover of
Patterson not supported by Patterson-UTI's board of directors, including a
proposed takeover that may be desired by a majority of our stockholders or
result in a payment of a premium over the prevailing market price of
Patterson-UTI common stock.

                                   THE MERGER

BACKGROUND OF THE MERGER

     On January 19, 2001, Mr. Siegel called Mr. Talbott to inquire as to Mr.
Talbott's availability during the week of January 29 to discuss a possible
combination of Patterson and UTI. Mr. Talbott indicated that he would be
available that week.

     On January 26, 2001, the UTI board of directors held a telephonic meeting
at which Mr. Siegel advised the board that he had called Mr. Talbott to set up a
meeting. The UTI board discussed the desirability of a combination with
Patterson and unanimously endorsed Mr. Siegel's meeting with Mr. Talbott.

     On January 29, 2001, Mr. Siegel called Mr. Talbott and recommended that
they meet beginning on Thursday, February 1, 2001, and work continuously to see
if a combination between the two companies were possible. Mr. Talbott agreed to
meet on Thursday morning, February 1, 2001.

     On January 29, 2001, Mr. Talbott called a Patterson telephonic board
meeting to report that Mr. Siegel had contacted him and suggested that
negotiations begin regarding a possible merger of Patterson and UTI. The board
authorized Mr. Talbott to begin negotiations with Mr. Siegel and report back to
the board with results of the negotiations.

     On January 30 and 31, 2001, Messrs. Siegel and Talbott discussed certain
procedural matters by telephone.

     On February 1, 2001, Messrs. Siegel, Berns and Talbott met in the early
morning at a hotel in Dallas, Texas to discuss a possible merger of equals.
Messrs. Talbott, Siegel and Berns met continuously on February 1 and 2. After
extensive discussion, they agreed that a combination would be beneficial to each
of the companies and their stockholders and decided to apprise their respective
boards of the substance of their negotiations and their recommendation to move
forward toward negotiating a definitive merger agreement.

     On February 2, 2001, Mr. Talbott called a telephonic board meeting at 10:00
a.m. to update the Patterson board on the status of negotiations and seek
guidance from the board on whether he should continue negotiating a possible
combination of the two companies. He informed the board that he and Mr. Siegel
believed that a combination of the two companies would be beneficial to both
companies and their stockholders. Following Mr. Talbott's report, management of
Patterson presented to its board a financial analysis of a combined
Patterson-UTI. The Patterson board discussed various issues relating to the
merger including the strategic value of the merger to Patterson and its
stockholders, management of the combined company, the exchange ratio and the
composition of the board of the combined company.

     After extensive discussion, the board instructed Mr. Talbott to continue
negotiations with Mr. Siegel on the basis of a merger of Patterson and UTI with
the following terms:

     - Patterson's stockholders would own greater than 50% of the combined
       companies after the merger.

     - Patterson's board would hold a one seat majority of the board after the
       merger, and

     - Mr. Talbott would continue to be chief executive officer of Patterson
       after the merger.

     At a telephonic board meeting commencing at 1:30 p.m., on February 2, 2001,
Messrs. Siegel and Berns provided the UTI board of directors with an update on
the status of the negotiations of a possible business combination with
Patterson. The UTI board of directors indicated its support for a merger and its
belief that the exchange ratio should be close to one to one. The UTI board
directed Messrs. Siegel and Berns to continue negotiations with Patterson.

     After both board meetings, Messrs. Talbott, Siegel and Berns continued
negotiations, and management of both companies began negotiating and drafting a
merger agreement for approval by their respective boards.

     Following negotiations on February 3 and 4, 2001, Messrs. Talbott, Siegel
and Berns, management of the respective companies and their counsel negotiated
the following terms of a merger:

     - UTI would merge into Patterson and Patterson would change its name to
       Patterson-UTI Energy, Inc.;

     - each UTI stockholder would receive one share of Patterson stock for each
       of its outstanding shares, which would result in Patterson stockholders
       owning approximately 50.5% and UTI stockholders owning approximately
       49.5% of the combined Patterson-UTI immediately after the merger,

     - Patterson's board would choose six members and UTI's board would choose
       the remaining five members of the combined Patterson-UTI board.

     It was further understood that after consummation of the merger, Mr. Siegel
would serve as Chairman while Mr. Talbott would serve as Chief Executive Officer
of a combined Patterson-UTI.

     At a telephonic board meeting commencing at 5:30 p.m. on February 4, 2001,
Mr. Siegel advised the UTI board of directors that management of UTI had
negotiated the terms of a definitive merger agreement with representatives of
Patterson, subject to the approval of the UTI board of directors. UTI's legal
counsel reviewed the material terms of the merger agreement with the UTI board
of directors. Also, at the board meeting Lehman Brothers made a presentation to
the UTI board of directors with regard to the reasons supporting the merger and
the financial impact to UTI and its stockholders. At the conclusion of the
presentation, Lehman Brothers advised the UTI board of directors that it would
issue its fairness opinion as of the date of the meeting, subject to the UTI
board of directors' approval of the merger. After discussion, the UTI board of
directors unanimously approved the merger agreement.

     On the evening of February 4, 2001, Patterson's board of directors convened
via telephone to review the progress of the proposed merger transaction with
UTI. Mr. Talbott and other members of Patterson's management team and
Patterson's legal counsel briefed the board on the results of the negotiations.
In addition, Patterson's senior management briefed the board as to the strategic
rationales for the transaction and Patterson's counsel reviewed the proposed
terms of the transaction and the merger agreement.

     Following the presentation of the terms of the merger, Merrill Lynch,
financial advisor to the Patterson board on this transaction, delivered its
fairness opinion presentation to the Patterson board, in which it gave its
opinion that, as of that date and based on and subject to the matters described
in its opinion, the exchange ratio was fair, from a financial point of view, to
Patterson and its stockholders.

     At the conclusion of the meeting, Patterson's board, with one member
abstaining, determined that the merger agreement and merger transactions were
fair to, and in the best interests of, Patterson and its stockholders, and
resolved to recommend that Patterson's stockholders adopt the merger agreement
and approve the merger and an amendment to Patterson's restated certificate of
incorporation increasing the number of authorized shares of common stock from
50,000,000 to 200,000,000 and change the name of Patterson to Patterson-UTI
Energy, Inc.

     Following execution of the definitive merger agreement, a joint press
release announcing the merger transaction was issued on February 5, 2001.

UTI'S REASONS FOR THE MERGER

     UTI's board of directors believes that the terms of the merger are in the
best interests of UTI and its stockholders, has unanimously approved the merger
and the merger agreement and recommends that the UTI stockholders approve and
adopt the merger and merger agreement.

     UTI's board of directors considers the merger to be a means of achieving
the long term strategic and financial goals of UTI while at the same time
offering the UTI stockholders the ability to participate in a

larger, more diversified land drilling company. In reaching its conclusion to
approve the merger, the UTI board of directors also considered the factors
listed below:

     - information concerning the historical financial performance and
       condition, business operations and prospects of each of UTI and
       Patterson, and UTI's projected future performance and prospects as a
       separate entity and on a combined basis with Patterson;

     - current industry, economic and market conditions;

     - the fact that the combination of the two companies would create the
       second largest drilling company in the United States and that the
       geographic locations, strengths and drilling rig fleets of UTI and
       Patterson complement one another;

     - the fact that the size and importance in the industry of the combined
       companies likely would provide greater visibility and a stronger
       following by research analysts and greater stock market liquidity than
       UTI would have on its own;

     - recent and historical market prices of UTI's common stock and Patterson's
       common stock;

     - the structure of the transaction and terms of the merger agreement and
       the one to one exchange ratio, which were the result of arm's-length
       negotiations between UTI and Patterson;

     - the financial analysis and opinion of Lehman Brothers;

     - the fact that the merger would provide holders of UTI common stock with
       the opportunity to receive a premium over recent market prices for UTI
       common stock;

     - the terms of the merger agreement that permit the UTI board of directors,
       in the exercise of its fiduciary duties and subject to certain
       conditions, to terminate the merger agreement if UTI receives a takeover
       proposal that the UTI board of directors deems to be a "superior
       proposal" (as defined in the merger agreement); in this regard, the UTI
       board of directors noted that if it were to terminate the merger
       agreement under those circumstances, UTI must pay to Patterson a $32.5
       million fee plus reimbursement of expenses up to $2.5 million, and if the
       UTI stockholders did not approve the merger and UTI had not received a
       superior takeover proposal, UTI must pay to Patterson a $2.5 million fee
       plus reimbursement of expenses up to $2.5 million; the UTI board of
       directors did not view the termination fee provision of the merger
       agreement as unreasonably deterring any seriously interested third party
       from making a superior proposal;

     - the expectation that the merger would result in the holders of UTI common
       stock receiving the opportunity to receive shares of Patterson common
       stock in a transaction that is not expected to have any immediate United
       States federal income tax impact;

     - the expectation that the merger of UTI and Patterson will be treated for
       accounting purposes as a pooling-of-interests;

     - the historical performance and reputation of Patterson; and

     - the likelihood that the merger would be consummated.

     In determining that the merger was in the best interests of UTI's
stockholders, the UTI board of directors considered the factors discussed above
as a whole and did not assign specific or relative weights to those factors. The
UTI board of directors believes that the merger is an opportunity for UTI's
stockholders to participate in a combined enterprise that has significantly
greater business and financial resources than UTI would have without the merger
and to receive, on a tax deferred basis, a premium for their shares of UTI
common stock, based on recent market prices.

RECOMMENDATION OF THE UTI BOARD OF DIRECTORS

     For the reasons set forth under "The Merger -- Background of the Merger"
and "The Merger -- UTI's Reasons for the Merger," the UTI board of directors
believes that the merger is in the best interests

of UTI and the holders of UTI common stock. THE UTI BOARD OF DIRECTORS
UNANIMOUSLY ADOPTED THE MERGER AND THE MERGER AGREEMENT AND RECOMMENDS THAT THE
HOLDERS OF UTI COMMON STOCK VOTE "FOR" ADOPTION OF THE MERGER AND THE MERGER
AGREEMENT.

OPINION OF UTI'S FINANCIAL ADVISOR

     Lehman Brothers acted as UTI's financial advisor in connection with the
merger. UTI instructed Lehman Brothers, in its role as financial advisor, to
evaluate the fairness, from a financial perspective, of the exchange ratio
offered to UTI stockholders in the merger. On February 4, 2001, Lehman Brothers
delivered its oral and written opinion to the UTI board that, as of such date
and based upon and subject to certain matters stated therein, from a financial
point of view, the exchange ratio offered to UTI's stockholders in the merger
was fair to such stockholders.

     THE FULL TEXT OF THE LEHMAN BROTHERS' WRITTEN OPINION IS INCLUDED IN ANNEX
B TO THIS JOINT PROXY STATEMENT/PROSPECTUS, AND IS INCORPORATED HEREIN BY
REFERENCE. UTI STOCKHOLDERS MAY READ LEHMAN BROTHERS' OPINION FOR A DISCUSSION
OF THE ASSUMPTIONS MADE, FACTORS CONSIDERED AND LIMITATIONS UPON THE REVIEW
UNDERTAKEN BY LEHMAN BROTHERS IN RENDERING ITS OPINION. THE FOLLOWING IS SUMMARY
OF THE MATERIAL PROVISIONS OF LEHMAN BROTHERS' OPINION AND IS QUALIFIED IN ITS
ENTIRETY BY REFERENCE TO SUCH OPINION.

     Except as described in the next sentence, no limitations were imposed by
UTI on the scope of Lehman Brothers' investigation or the procedures to be
followed by Lehman Brothers in rendering its opinion. In arriving at its
opinion, at the direction of UTI, Lehman Brothers had limited opportunity to
conduct due diligence on UTI and Patterson and, as further described below,
Lehman Brothers' opinion therefore was necessarily based primarily upon publicly
available information. The form and amount of the consideration to be received
by UTI stockholders in the merger was determined through arm's-length
negotiations between the parties. Lehman Brothers' advisory services and opinion
were provided for the use and benefit of the UTI board in connection with its
consideration of the merger. Lehman Brothers' opinion is not intended to be and
does not constitute a recommendation to any UTI stockholder as to how such
stockholder should vote with respect to the merger. Lehman Brothers was not
requested to opine as to, and its opinion does not address, UTI's underlying
business decision to proceed with the merger. In addition, Lehman Brothers'
opinion does not address the prices at which shares of Patterson common stock
will actually trade after the merger.

     In arriving at its opinion, Lehman Brothers reviewed and analyzed the
following:

     - the merger agreement and the specific terms of the merger (including with
       respect to corporate governance of the combined company);

     - publicly available information concerning UTI and Patterson that Lehman
       Brothers believed to be relevant to its analysis, including Annual
       Reports on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 1999 and
       Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2000;

     - a trading history of the common stock of each of UTI and Patterson from
       February 2, 2000 to the present and a comparison of these trading
       histories with each other and with those of other companies that Lehman
       Brothers deemed relevant;

     - a comparison of the historical financial results and present financial
       condition of each of UTI and Patterson with each other and with those of
       other companies that Lehman Brothers deemed relevant;

     - a comparison of the financial terms of the merger with the financial
       terms of certain other transactions that Lehman Brothers deemed relevant;

     - estimates of third party research analysts with respect to the future
       financial performance of each of UTI and Patterson; and

     - the relative contributions of UTI and Patterson to the historical and
       future financial performance of the combined company on a pro forma
       basis.

In addition, Lehman Brothers had discussions with the management of each of UTI
and Patterson concerning their respective businesses, operations, assets,
financial condition and prospects and concerning the strategic benefits expected
to result from the merger and undertook such other studies, analyses and
investigations as it deemed appropriate.

     In arriving at its opinion, Lehman Brothers assumed and relied upon the
accuracy and completeness of the financial and other information used by Lehman
Brothers without assuming any responsibility for independent verification of
such information and further relied upon the assurances of managements of UTI
and Patterson that they are not aware of any facts or circumstances that would
make such information inaccurate or misleading. In arriving at its opinion,
Lehman Brothers did not review financial projections of UTI or Patterson
prepared by management of UTI or Patterson. Based on the advice of UTI, Lehman
Brothers assumed that the published estimates of third party research analysts
are a reasonable basis upon which to evaluate the future financial performance
of UTI and Patterson on a comparative basis. In arriving at its opinion, Lehman
Brothers did not conduct a physical inspection of the properties and facilities
of UTI or Patterson and did not make or obtain any evaluations or appraisals of
the assets or liabilities of UTI or Patterson. In addition, the UTI board did
not authorize Lehman Brothers to solicit, and Lehman Brothers did not solicit,
any proposals or offers from any third party with respect to the purchase of all
or a part of UTI's business. Upon advice of UTI and its legal and accounting
advisors, Lehman Brothers assumed that the merger will qualify (i) for
pooling-of-interests accounting treatment and (ii) as a reorganization within
the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended,
and therefore qualify as a tax-free transaction to the stockholders of UTI.
Lehman Brothers' opinion necessarily was based upon market, economic and other
conditions as they existed on, and could be evaluated as of, the date of its
opinion.

     In arriving at its opinion, Lehman Brothers did not ascribe a specific
range of values to UTI or Patterson, but rather made its determination as to the
fairness, from a financial point of view, of the exchange ratio on the basis of
the financial and comparative analyses described below. The preparation of a
fairness opinion involves various determinations as to the most appropriate and
relevant methods of financial and comparative analysis and the application of
those methods to the particular circumstances. As a result, fairness opinions
are not readily susceptible to summary description. Furthermore, in arriving at
its opinion, Lehman Brothers did not attribute any particular weight to any
analysis or factor considered by it, but rather made qualitative judgments as to
the significance and relevance of each analysis and factor. Accordingly, Lehman
Brothers believes that its analyses must be considered as a whole and that
considering any portion of such analyses and of the factors considered, without
considering all analyses and factors, could create a misleading or incomplete
view of the process underlying its opinion. In performing its analyses, Lehman
Brothers made numerous assumptions with respect to industry performance, general
business and economic conditions and other matters, many of which are beyond the
control of UTI or Patterson. None of UTI, Patterson, Lehman Brothers or any
other person assumes responsibility if future results are materially different
from those discussed. Any estimates contained in the analyses are not
necessarily indicative of actual values or predictive of future results or
values, which may be significantly more or less favorable than as set forth
therein. In addition, analyses relating to the value of businesses do not
purport to be appraisals or to reflect the prices at which businesses may
actually be sold.

     Financial Analyses.  The following is a summary of the material financial
analyses used by Lehman Brothers in connection with providing its opinion to the
UTI board. Certain of the summaries of financial analyses include information
presented in tabular format. In order to fully understand the financial analyses
used by Lehman Brothers, the tables must be read together with the text of each
summary. The tables alone do not constitute a complete description of the
financial and comparative analyses. In particular, you should note that in
applying the various valuation methodologies to the particular businesses,
operations

and prospects of UTI and Patterson, and the particular circumstances of the
merger, Lehman Brothers made qualitative judgments as to the significance and
relevance of each analysis. In addition, Lehman Brothers made numerous
assumptions with respect to industry performance, general business and economic
conditions and other matters, many of which are beyond the control of UTI and
Patterson. Accordingly, analyses and the implied exchange ratios derived
therefrom set forth in the tables and described below must be considered as a
whole. Considering any portion of such analyses, including the implied exchange
ratios set forth in the tables below, and of the factors considered without
considering all analyses, factors and the assumptions underlying these analyses,
could create a misleading or incomplete view of the process underlying, and
conclusions represented by Lehman Brothers' opinion.

                                                                                          IMPLIED

     Comparable Company Trading Analysis.  With respect to UTI and Patterson,
Lehman Brothers reviewed the public stock market trading multiples for selected
domestic U.S. land drilling companies, including, but not limited to, the
following:

     - Grey Wolf, Inc.,

     - Helmerich & Payne Inc.,

     - Key Energy Services, Inc.,

     - Nabors Industries, Inc., and

     - Precision Drilling Corporation.

Using publicly available information, Lehman Brothers calculated and analyzed
the common equity market value multiples of certain projected financial criteria
based upon published analyst estimates, such as net income and discretionary
cash flow. Lehman Brothers also calculated and analyzed the adjusted
capitalization multiples of certain projected financial criteria based upon
published analyst estimates, such as EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes,
depreciation and amortization). The adjusted capitalization of each company was
obtained by adding long-term debt to the sum of the market value of its common
equity, the value of its preferred stock based upon its market value if publicly
traded and its liquidation value if privately held, and the book value of any
minority interest minus the cash balance.

     This methodology yielded an implied exchange ratio range of 0.850 to 0.910.
However, because of the inherent differences between the businesses, operations
and prospects of UTI and Patterson and the companies included in the comparable
companies group, Lehman Brothers believed that it was inappropriate to, and
therefore did not, rely solely on the quantitative results of the analysis.
Accordingly, Lehman Brothers also made qualitative judgments concerning the
differences between the financial and operating characteristics of UTI and
Patterson and the companies in the comparable companies group that would affect
the public trading values of UTI and Patterson and such comparable companies.

     Comparable Acquisitions Analysis.  With respect to UTI and Patterson,
Lehman Brothers reviewed certain publicly available information on selected
domestic U.S. and international transactions which were announced from June of
1994 to September of 2000 including, but not limited to, the following:

     - Schlumberger N.V. (Schlumberger Limited)/Camco International Inc.,

     - Baker Hughes Incorporated/Western Atlas Inc.,

     - Energy Ventures, Inc./Weatherford Enterra, Inc.,

     - Halliburton Company/Dresser Industries, Inc.,

     - National-Oilwell, Inc./Dreco Energy Services, Ltd.,

     - Nabors Industries, Inc./Pool Energy Services Co.,

     - Precision Drilling Corporation/Plains Energy Services Ltd.,

     - Bonus Resource Services Corp./Tetonka Drilling Inc., and

     - Transocean Sedco Forex Inc./R&B Falcon Corporation.

For each transaction, Lehman Brothers calculated an enterprise value multiple
based on the EBITDA during the last twelve month period prior to announcement of
the transaction and equity value multiples based on the one and two year forward
estimated net income.

     The enterprise and equity value multiples were applied to UTI's data points
for each of the above-mentioned statistics adjusting the enterprise value for
the market value of total debt less cash and cash equivalents to calculate an
implied equity value range.

     The comparable acquisitions analysis resulted in an implied exchange ratio
range of 0.850-0.910. However, because the market conditions, rationale and
circumstances surrounding each of the transactions analyzed were specific to
each transaction and because of the inherent differences between the businesses,
operations and prospects of UTI and Patterson and the companies involved in the
transactions analyzed, Lehman Brothers believed that it was inappropriate to,
and therefore did not, rely solely on the quantitative results of the analysis.
Accordingly, Lehman Brothers also made qualitative judgments concerning the
differences between the characteristics of these transactions and the merger
that would affect the equity values of UTI and Patterson and such other
companies.

     Historical Common Stock Trading Analysis.  Lehman Brothers reviewed the
daily historical closing share prices of the UTI and Patterson common stock for
the period from February 2, 2000 to February 2, 2001. Lehman Brothers analyzed
the ratio of the February 2, 2001 closing share price for UTI to the
corresponding closing share price of Patterson. In addition, Lehman Brothers
reviewed the ratio of the closing share prices for UTI and Patterson based on
the 10, 20, 30, 60, 90 and 120 trading day averages as of February 2, 2001.
Based on these average closing prices of the UTI and Patterson common stock,
this analysis implies an exchange ratio range of 0.753 to 0.919.

     Contribution Analysis.  Lehman Brothers utilized historical financial data
provided by UTI and Patterson regarding their land drilling operations to
calculate the relative contributions by UTI and Patterson to the pro forma
combined company with respect to net income and discretionary cash flow for the
calendar year 2000. Lehman Brothers also calculated similar contributions based
on 2001 and 2002 projected net income and discretionary cash flow based on
consensus earnings estimates for both companies as reported by First Call, a
service reporting equity analyst estimates. In all cases, Lehman

Brothers compared UTI's contribution percentages to UTI stockholders' expected
50% pro forma ownership of the combined company. The following table summarizes
the results of this analysis.

                                                     UTI         PATTERSON        IMPLIED

     Premiums Paid Analysis.  With respect to UTI, Lehman Brothers reviewed the
premiums paid in selected domestic U.S. and international oilfield
equipment/services company transactions based upon publicly available
information which were announced from June of 1994 to August of 2000 including,
but not limited to, the following:

     - Schlumberger N.V. (Schlumberger Limited)/Camco,

     - Baker Hughes Incorporated/Western Atlas Inc.,

     - Energy Ventures, Inc./Weatherford Enterra, Inc.,

     - Halliburton Company/Dresser Industries, Inc.,

     - National-Oilwell, Inc./Dreco Energy Services, Ltd.,

     - Camco International Inc./Production Operators Corp.,

     - National-Oilwell, Inc./IRI International Corporation,

     - Precision Drilling Corporation/Plains Energy Services Ltd., and

     - Transocean Sedco Forex Inc./R&B Falcon Corporation.

For each transaction, Lehman Brothers calculated the premium paid to the
stockholders of the acquired company based upon the acquired company's common
stock price one day, one week, four weeks and eight weeks prior to the
announcement date of such transaction.

     The transaction premiums were applied to UTI's data point for each of the
dates specified to obtain a range of values for UTI's common stock. Theses
values were then compared to Patterson's closing common stock price on the last
trading day preceding delivery of Lehman Brothers' opinion to the UTI Board.

     The premiums paid analysis resulted in an implied exchange ratio of 0.830
to 1.110. However, because the market conditions, rationale and circumstances
surrounding each of the transactions analyzed were specific to each transaction
and because of the inherent differences between the businesses, operations and
prospects of UTI and Patterson and the companies involved in the transactions
analyzed, Lehman Brothers believed that it was inappropriate to, and therefore
did not, rely solely on the quantitative results of the analysis. Accordingly,
Lehman Brothers also made qualitative judgments concerning the differences
between the characteristics of these transactions and the merger that would
affect the equity values of UTI and Patterson and such other companies.

     Pro Forma Merger Consequences Analysis.  Lehman Brothers analyzed the pro
forma impact of the merger on UTI's projected earnings per share and
discretionary cash flow per share. Projected net income and discretionary cash
flow for fiscal years 2001 and 2002 was based on third party research estimates
reported by First Call, a service reporting equity analyst estimates. Lehman
Brothers compared the

earnings and discretionary cash flow of UTI on a standalone basis to the
earnings and discretionary cash flow attributable to UTI's respective interests
in pro forma Patterson. The analysis indicated that the merger will be accretive
to UTI's net income and discretionary cash flow per share in 2001 and 2002.

     Lehman Brothers Financial Advisory Fee -- Lehman Brothers is an
internationally recognized investment banking firm engaged in, among other
things, the valuation of businesses and their securities in connection with
mergers and acquisitions, negotiated underwritings, competitive bids, secondary
distributions of listed and unlisted securities, private placements and
valuations for corporate and other purposes. The UTI board selected Lehman
Brothers because of its expertise, reputation and familiarity with UTI in
particular and the oilfield service industry in general and because its
investment banking professionals have substantial experience in transactions
comparable to the merger.

     Pursuant to the terms of an engagement letter dated February 3, 2001,
between Lehman Brothers and UTI, UTI agreed to pay Lehman Brothers a fee of
$2,000,000 upon the delivery of its fairness opinion. UTI also agreed to
reimburse Lehman Brothers for its reasonable expenses incurred in connection
with its engagement, and to indemnify Lehman Brothers and certain related
persons against certain liabilities in connection with its engagement. Lehman
Brothers has previously rendered financial advisory and investment banking
services to UTI for which it has received customary compensation.

     In the ordinary course of its business, Lehman Brothers actively trades in
the equity securities of UTI and Patterson for its own account and for the
accounts of its customers and, accordingly, may at any time hold a long or short
position in such securities.

PATTERSON'S REASONS FOR THE MERGER

     Patterson's board of directors has determined that the merger agreement is
fair to and in the best interest of the stockholders of Patterson. In reaching
its decision to approve the merger agreement, the Patterson board of directors
consulted with Patterson's legal and financial advisors, as well as with
Patterson's management, including the management members of Patterson's board of
directors. The Patterson board of directors considered the following factors:

     - The complementary nature of Patterson's and UTI's respective businesses,
       assets and strategic objectives;

     - The historical financial performance and condition, and operations and
       prospects of Patterson and UTI on a combined basis and of Patterson and
       UTI, as separate entities;

     - Diversification of operations into the prolific oil and natural gas
       regions of Western Canada;

     - Belief that the expected greater visibility and enhanced market
       capitalization of the combined companies following the merger, together
       with the expected increase in stock market liquidity should provide
       opportunity for investment in Patterson-UTI by institutions having more
       purchasing power and more stringent investment policies and practices;

     - Belief that economies of scale and other cost savings obtainable from the
       merger would, if realized, create additional value to Patterson
       stockholders;

     - Belief that the proposed merger would result in improvements in key
       performances indicators including cash flow;

     - Financial presentation to the board of directors and related opinion from
       Patterson's financial advisor to the effect that, as of the date of its
       opinion and based on and subject to the matters described in its opinion,
       the exchange ratio was fair from a financial point of view to Patterson
       and the Patterson stockholders, as more fully described under "Opinion of
       Patterson's Financial Advisor"; and

     - The terms and conditions of the merger agreement and the merger were
       viewed by the Patterson board of directors and management to be fair to
       and in the best interest of Patterson and its stockholders.

     Patterson's board of directors believes that the further expansion of
Patterson's onshore drilling fleet through the merger, the enhancement of
Patterson's financial position and the possible positive impact on
Patterson-UTI's earnings that could result from any consolidation savings
realized in the merger will enhance Patterson's long-term growth potential.

     All combinations, including the merger, include certain risk and
disadvantages. Material potential risks associated with the merger are discussed
in "Risk Factors" commencing on page 19 of this document. You are urged to
review that section.

RECOMMENDATIONS OF THE PATTERSON BOARD OF DIRECTORS

     After consideration of the factors discussed above, and without weight to
any specific factor, the members of Patterson's board of directors voting on the
merger and the proposed amendments to Patterson's restated certificate of
incorporation, have determined that the terms of the merger are fair to and in
the best interest of Patterson and the Patterson stockholders.

     THE PATTERSON BOARD RECOMMENDS THAT PATTERSON STOCKHOLDERS VOTE AT THE
PATTERSON SPECIAL STOCKHOLDER MEETING TO ADOPT THE MERGER AGREEMENT AND THE
MERGER AND THE AMENDMENT TO PATTERSON'S RESTATED CERTIFICATE OF INCORPORATION TO
INCREASE THE AUTHORIZED SHARES OF PATTERSON'S COMMON STOCK AND THE AMENDMENT TO
PATTERSON'S RESTATED CERTIFICATE OF INCORPORATION FOR THE NAME CHANGE.

     One of the Patterson board members abstained from voting on the merger and
the charter amendments, because he believed that he lacked sufficient
information and time to make an informed decision.

OPINION OF PATTERSON'S FINANCIAL ADVISOR

     Patterson retained Merrill Lynch to act as its financial advisor in
connection with the merger. On February 4, 2001, Merrill Lynch rendered its oral
opinion to the Patterson board of directors, which was later confirmed in
writing, in the Merrill Lynch fairness opinion letter dated February 4, 2001,
that, as of that date and based upon and subject to the factors and assumptions
described in the Merrill Lynch fairness opinion letter, the exchange ratio was
fair from a financial point of view to Patterson.

     THE FULL TEXT OF THE MERRILL LYNCH FAIRNESS OPINION, WHICH SETS FORTH THE
ASSUMPTIONS MADE, MATTERS CONSIDERED, AND QUALIFICATIONS AND LIMITATIONS ON THE
REVIEW UNDERTAKEN BY MERRILL LYNCH, IS ATTACHED AS ANNEX C TO THIS JOINT PROXY
STATEMENT/PROSPECTUS AND IS INCORPORATED IN THIS DOCUMENT BY REFERENCE. THE
SUMMARY OF THE MERRILL LYNCH FAIRNESS OPINION SET FORTH IN THIS JOINT PROXY
STATEMENT/PROSPECTUS IS QUALIFIED IN ITS ENTIRETY BY REFERENCE TO THE FULL TEXT
OF THE OPINION. STOCKHOLDERS OF PATTERSON ARE URGED TO READ THE OPINION IN ITS
ENTIRETY. THE MERRILL LYNCH FAIRNESS OPINION WAS PROVIDED TO THE PATTERSON BOARD
FOR ITS INFORMATION AND IS DIRECTED ONLY TO THE FAIRNESS FROM A FINANCIAL POINT
OF VIEW OF THE EXCHANGE RATIO TO PATTERSON AND DOES NOT ADDRESS THE MERITS OF
THE UNDERLYING DECISION BY PATTERSON TO ENGAGE IN THE MERGER AND DOES NOT
CONSTITUTE A RECOMMENDATION TO PATTERSON'S STOCKHOLDERS AS TO HOW THE
STOCKHOLDERS SHOULD VOTE ON THE MERGER OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED BY THE
MERGER AGREEMENT. MERRILL LYNCH HAS NOT EXPRESSED ANY OPINION AS TO THE PRICES
AT WHICH PATTERSON COMMON STOCK WILL TRADE FOLLOWING THE ANNOUNCEMENT OR
CONSUMMATION OF THE MERGER.

     The summary set forth below does not purport to be a complete description
of the analyses underlying the Merrill Lynch fairness opinion or the
presentation made by Merrill Lynch to the Patterson board. The preparation of a
fairness opinion is a complex and analytical process involving various
determinations as to the most appropriate and relevant methods of financial
analysis and the application of those methods to the particular circumstances
and, therefore, the opinion is not readily susceptible to partial analysis or
summary description. In arriving at its opinion, Merrill Lynch did not attribute
any particular weight to any analysis or factor considered by it, but rather
made qualitative judgments as to the significance and relevance of each analysis
and factor. Accordingly, Merrill Lynch believes that its analyses must be
considered as a whole and that selecting portions of its analyses, without
considering all of its analyses, would create an incomplete view of the process
underlying the Merrill Lynch fairness opinion.

     In performing its analyses, numerous assumptions were made with respect to
industry performance, general business, economic, market and financial
conditions and other matters, many of which are beyond the control of Merrill
Lynch, UTI or Patterson. Any estimates contained in the analyses performed by
Merrill Lynch are not necessarily indicative of actual values or future results,
which may be significantly more or less favorable than suggested by the
analyses. Additionally, estimates of the value of businesses or securities do
not purport to be appraisals or to reflect the prices at which the businesses or
securities might actually be sold. Accordingly, the analyses and estimates are
inherently subject to substantial uncertainty. In addition, the requirement for
the delivery of the Merrill Lynch fairness opinion was among several factors
taken into consideration by the Patterson board in making its determination to
approve the merger agreement and the merger and in reaching its determination to
recommend approval of the merger agreement and the transactions contemplated by
the merger agreement, including the merger, the respective proposed amendments
to Patterson's restated certificate of incorporation authorizing additional
Patterson common shares and the change in Patterson's name. Consequently, the
Merrill Lynch analyses described below should not be viewed as determinative of
the decision of the Patterson board or Patterson's management with respect to
the fairness of the exchange ratio.

     In arriving at its opinion, Merrill Lynch, among other things:

     - Reviewed certain publicly available business and financial information
       relating to UTI and Patterson that Merrill Lynch deemed to be relevant
       including (a) Annual Reports on Form 10-K and related audited financial
       statements for the three years ended December 31, 1999 and (b) Quarterly
       Reports on Form 10-Q and related unaudited financial statements for the
       quarterly periods ending March 31, 2000, June 30, 2000 and September 30,
       2000;

     - Reviewed certain information, including financial forecasts, relating to
       the business, earnings, cash flow, assets, liabilities and prospects of
       UTI, as well as the amount of the cost savings and related expenses and
       synergies expected to result from the merger (the "Expected Synergies")
       furnished to Merrill Lynch by Patterson;

     - Conducted discussions with members of senior management of UTI and
       Patterson concerning the matters described in the two preceding
       paragraphs above, as well as their respective businesses and prospects
       before and after giving effect to the merger;

     - Reviewed the market prices and valuation multiples for UTI shares and
       Patterson shares and compared them with those of certain publicly traded
       companies that Merrill Lynch deemed to be relevant;

     - Reviewed the results of operations of UTI and Patterson and compared them
       with those of certain publicly traded companies that Merrill Lynch deemed
       to be relevant;

     - Compared the proposed financial terms of the merger with the financial
       terms of certain other transactions which Merrill Lynch deemed to be
       relevant;

     - Reviewed the potential pro forma impact of the merger on Patterson;

     - Reviewed a draft dated February 4, 2001 of the merger agreement; and

     - Reviewed such other financial studies and analyses and took into account
       such other matters as Merrill Lynch deemed necessary, including Merrill
       Lynch's assessment of general economic, market and monetary conditions.

     In preparing its opinion, Merrill Lynch assumed and relied on the accuracy
and completeness of all information supplied or otherwise made available to
Merrill Lynch, discussed with or reviewed by or for Merrill Lynch, or publicly
available, and Merrill Lynch did not assume any responsibility for independently
verifying such information or undertake an independent evaluation or appraisal
of any of the assets or liabilities of UTI or receive any such evaluation or
appraisal. In addition, Merrill Lynch did not assume any obligation to conduct
any physical inspection of the properties or facilities of UTI. With respect to
the financial forecast information and the Expected Synergies furnished to or
discussed with Merrill Lynch by

UTI or Patterson, Merrill Lynch assumed that they were reasonably prepared and
reflected the best currently available estimates and judgment of UTI's or
Patterson's managements as to the expected future financial performance of UTI
or Patterson, as the case may be, and the Expected Synergies. Merrill Lynch made
no independent investigation of any legal matters and accounting advice given to
such parties and their respective boards of directors, including, without
limitation, advice as to the accounting and tax consequences of the merger.
Merrill Lynch also assumed that the signed merger agreement would be
substantially similar to the February 4, 2001 draft reviewed by Merrill Lynch.

     Merrill Lynch's opinion is necessarily based upon market, economic and
other conditions as they exist and can be evaluated on, and on the information
made available to Merrill Lynch as of the date of the opinion. Merrill Lynch
assumed that in the course of obtaining the necessary regulatory or other
consents or approvals (contractual or otherwise) for the merger, no
restrictions, including any divestiture requirements or amendments or
modifications, will be imposed that will have a material adverse effect on the
contemplated benefits of the merger.

     The exchange ratio was determined through analyses of current and projected
financial data of both Patterson and UTI and through negotiations between the
chairmen of both Patterson and UTI. After substantial analysis and
consideration, the merger was authorized by the Patterson board.

     The following is a brief summary of the material analyses performed by
Merrill Lynch in connection with its preparation of the Merrill Lynch fairness
opinion. Some of these summaries of financial analyses include information
presented in tabular format. In order to understand fully the financial analyses
used by Merrill Lynch, the tables must be read together with the text of each
summary. The tables alone do not constitute a complete description of the
financial analyses. Considering the data set forth in the tables without
considering the full narrative description of the financial analyses, including
the methodologies and assumptions underlying the analyses, could create a
misleading or incomplete view of the financial analyses performed by Merrill
Lynch.

     Financial Forecasts.  UTI and Patterson provided Merrill Lynch with their
respective forecasted financial performance. Merrill Lynch used such forecasted
financial information in conducting its analyses.

     Contribution Analysis.  Using the forecasts described above for both UTI
and Patterson for the years 2000 and 2001, Merrill Lynch compared the relative
projected levels of earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and
amortization ("EBITDA"), net income after income taxes ("Net Income") and
after-tax cash flow ("Cash Flow") for each company during this period. Merrill
Lynch compared the relative levels of each of these financial measures both with
and without incorporating the impact of the Expected Synergies in UTI's
financial measures.

     Relative levels of EBITDA, Net Income and Cash Flow were used to develop
implied equity value contributions. The results of these analyses are set forth
below.

                                                                PATTERSON'S IMPLIED
                                                         EQUITY MARKET VALUE CONTRIBUTION

                                                           WITHOUT                WITH
VALUATION BASIS                                       EXPECTED SYNERGIES   EXPECTED SYNERGIES
- ---------------                                       ------------------   ------------------

2000E EBITDA........................................         57.6%                47.6%
2001E EBITDA........................................         51.3                 46.8
2000E Net Income....................................         64.8                 44.8
2001E Net Income....................................         51.1                 45.3
2000E Cash Flow.....................................         57.8                 49.3
2001E Cash Flow.....................................         53.1                 49.1

     The contribution analysis implied an exchange ratio of 0.883-0.956 or a
Patterson implied equity value contribution of 51.0%-53.0% without incorporating
the impact of the Expected Synergies in UTI's financial measures and an exchange
ratio of 1.036-1.216 or a Patterson implied equity value contribution of 45.0%-
49.0% after incorporating the impact of the Expected Synergies in UTI's
financial measures.

     Comparable Company Acquisition Analysis.  Merrill Lynch also reviewed
publicly available information relating to comparable merger and acquisition
transactions in respect of companies with primarily contract drilling
operations. Because the reasons for, and circumstances surrounding, each of the
comparable transactions analyzed were so diverse and due to the dramatic
disparity in implied transaction multiples for the comparable transactions
analyzed, Merrill Lynch believes that a purely quantitative comparable company
acquisition analysis would not be dispositive in the context of the merger.
Merrill Lynch, therefore, deemed a comparable company acquisition analysis not
to be relevant in this situation.

     Comparable Company Trading Analysis.  Merrill Lynch reviewed and compared
certain financial information, ratios and public market multiples derived from
the Patterson and UTI projections to corresponding financial information, ratios
and public market multiples for four other publicly traded corporations in the
land drilling industry:

     - Grey Wolf, Inc.

     - Nabors Industries, Inc.

     - Precision Drilling Corporation

     - Pride International, Inc.

     The selected companies were chosen because they are publicly traded
companies with financial and operating characteristics which Merrill Lynch
deemed to be similar to those of Patterson and UTI, including, among other
things, equity market capitalization and land drilling focus. Merrill Lynch
calculated various financial ratios for the selected companies and compared them
to those calculated for Patterson and UTI. The ratios for the selected companies
were based on publicly available information, including estimates provided by
Merrill Lynch research. Merrill Lynch calculated the following financial ratios:

     - Enterprise value (defined as market value of common equity plus book
       value of debt less cash) multiples of 2001E EBITDA; and

     - Equity value multiples of 2001E Net Income and 2001E Cash Flow.

     The following table shows the relevant ranges determined by Merrill Lynch
for the selected companies.

FINANCIAL MEASURE                                        RELEVANT RANGE
- -----------------                                        --------------

2001E EBITDA..........................................   10.0x-12.0x
2001E Net Income......................................    20.0-30.0
2001E Cash Flow.......................................    15.0-18.0

     From the enterprise value ranges implied by these multiple ranges, Merrill
Lynch determined a relevant enterprise value range for Patterson under this
method of $1,450 million to $1,850 million, or an equity value range per diluted
share of $38.13 to $48.40.

     From the enterprise value ranges implied by these multiple ranges, and
without incorporating the Expected Synergies in UTI's financial measures,
Merrill Lynch determined a relevant enterprise value range for UTI under this
method of $1,400 million to $1,800 million or an equity value range per diluted
share of $34.58 to $44.81. From the enterprise value ranges implied by these
multiple ranges, and after incorporating the Expected Synergies in UTI's
financial measures, Merrill Lynch determined a relevant enterprise value range
for UTI under this method of $1,700 million to $2,100 million or an equity value
range per diluted share of $42.25 to $52.48.

     None of the selected companies are identical to Patterson or UTI.
Accordingly, an analysis of the results of the foregoing is not purely
mathematical. Rather, it involves complex considerations and judgments
concerning differences in financial and operating characteristics of the
selected companies and

other factors that could affect the public trading value of the comparable
companies or company to which they are being compared.

     The comparable company trading analysis implied an exchange ratio of
0.907-0.926 or a Patterson implied equity value contribution of 51.8%-52.3%
without incorporating the impact of the Expected Synergies in UTI's financial
measures and an exchange ratio of 1.084-1.108 or a Patterson implied equity
value contribution of 47.3%-47.9% after incorporating the impact of the Expected
Synergies in UTI's financial measures.

     Merger Premium Analysis.  In order to determine an implied exchange ratio
range based upon a merger premium analysis, Merrill Lynch examined premiums paid
for the target's equity value per share over pre-announcement stock prices one
day prior to announcement, one week prior to announcement and four weeks prior
to announcement in corporate merger transactions with a transaction value in the
range of $1.0 billion to $2.0 billion for the periods of 1990 to present.

     The following table shows the relevant ranges selected by Merrill Lynch for
the acquisition premiums paid over the target's stock price for one day, one
week and four weeks prior to the announcement.

  ONE DAY      ONE WEEK     FOUR WEEKS
- -----------   -----------   -----------
LOW    HIGH   LOW    HIGH   LOW    HIGH
- ----   ----   ----   ----   ----   ----

28.0%  30.0%  30.0%  33.0%  33.0%  36.0%

     The merger premium analysis implied an exchange ratio of 1.195-1.241 or a
Patterson implied equity value contribution of 44.5%-45.4%.

     Because the reasons for, and circumstances surrounding, each of the
transactions analyzed were different, Merrill Lynch believes that a purely
quantitative merger premium analysis would not be dispositive in the context of
the merger. Merrill Lynch further believes that an appropriate use of a merger
premium analysis in this instance involves quantitative judgments concerning the
differences between the characteristics of these transactions and the merger
that would affect the value of UTI and Patterson, which judgments are reflected
in Merrill Lynch's opinion.

     Relative Stock Price Analysis.  Using closing stock prices for Patterson
and UTI at February 2, 2001, as well as average closing stock prices for both
companies for the periods 30 days, 60 days, 90 days, 180 days and one year prior
to February 2, 2001, Merrill Lynch derived implied exchange ratios for Patterson
and UTI based on each of these average stock prices.

     The relative stock price analysis implied an exchange ratio of 0.750-0.900
or a Patterson implied equity value contribution of 52.5%-57.0%.

     Merger Consequences.  For both Patterson's projections and UTI's
projections, Merrill Lynch analyzed the respective contributions of each of
Patterson and UTI to the estimated Net Income of the combined company giving
effect to the merger on a pro forma basis for the year 2001 and analyzed the
increase in Net Income per current Patterson share resulting from the merger.
The foregoing analysis indicated that the merger would result in approximately
8.9% accretion to forecasted 2001 Net Income per current Patterson share,
assuming pooling-of-interests accounting treatment, before one-time merger
related costs and expenses and including the Expected Synergies.

     Merrill Lynch Financial Advisor Fee.  Pursuant to an engagement letter
dated February 2, 2001, Patterson retained Merrill Lynch to act as its financial
advisor in connection with the merger. Pursuant to the engagement letter,
Patterson agreed to pay Merrill Lynch a fee of $2,000,000, payable upon delivery
of the fairness opinion, for services rendered in connection with the merger.
Patterson has also agreed to reimburse Merrill Lynch for its reasonable
out-of-pocket expenses, including reasonable fees and disbursements of its legal
counsel. Additionally, Patterson has agreed to indemnify Merrill Lynch and its
affiliates and their respective officers, directors, employees, agents and
controlling persons against certain expenses, losses, claims, damages or
liabilities in connection with its services performed in connection with its
engagement.

     Patterson retained Merrill Lynch based upon Merrill Lynch's experience and
expertise. Merrill Lynch is an internationally recognized investment banking and
advisory firm. Merrill Lynch, as part of its investment banking business, is
continuously engaged in the valuation of businesses and securities in connection
with mergers and acquisitions, negotiated underwritings, competitive biddings,
secondary distributions of listed and unlisted securities, private placements
and valuations for corporate and other purposes. In the ordinary course of its
business, Merrill Lynch and its affiliates may actively trade the equity
securities of Patterson and UTI (and anticipate trading after the merger in the
securities of Patterson-UTI) for their own accounts and for the accounts of
customers and, accordingly, may at any time hold a long or short position in
these securities.

INTERESTS OF CERTAIN PERSONS IN THE MERGER

     UTI Directors and Executive Officers.  In considering the recommendation of
the UTI board of directors with respect to the merger, UTI stockholders should
be aware that some directors and executive officers have interests in the merger
that are different from UTI stockholders generally. The UTI board was aware of
these interests and took them into account in approving the merger.

     - Pursuant to the terms of the merger agreement, five of the seven members
       of the UTI board will be appointed directors of Patterson-UTI:

     - Under the merger agreement, Patterson has agreed to indemnify and hold
       harmless all past and present officers and directors of UTI to the
       fullest extent such persons may be indemnified pursuant to UTI's restated
       certificate of incorporation and bylaws for acts or omissions occurring
       at and prior to the effective time of the merger and to promptly advance
       reasonable litigation expenses incurred by such officers and directors in
       connection with investigating, preparing and defending any action arising
       out of such acts or omissions.

     - For a period of six years after the effective time of the merger,
       Patterson has agreed that it will provide UTI's current officers and
       directors with an insurance and indemnification policy that provides for
       coverage of events occurring prior to the effective time that is no less
       favorable than the existing policy or, if substantially equivalent
       insurance coverage is unavailable, the best available coverage; provided
       however, that Patterson shall not be required to pay an annual premium
       for such insurance in excess of $300,000 (two times the last annual
       premium paid by UTI preceding the date of the merger agreement).

     All outstanding stock options held by Mark S. Siegel, Vaughn E. Drum, John
E. Vollmer III and Bruce Sauers, executive officers of UTI, and one of its
directors, Kenneth N. Berns, will vest at closing of the merger due to change of
control provisions in their respective option agreements. In addition, four
other UTI employees hold stock options to purchase an aggregate of less than
65,000 shares of UTI common stock that will vest at closing of the merger. Three
of UTI's directors and officers, Messrs. Siegel, Berns and Vollmer, have
employment arrangements with UTI that also will entitle them to receive a
payment equal to one year's salary upon a change of control in UTI and the
cessation of their employment. UTI's President and Chief Executive Officer,
Vaughn E. Drum, has an employment agreement with UTI that provides that if his
employment is terminated without cause (as that term is defined in his
employment agreement), or, if he voluntarily terminates his employment within
one year of an adverse change (a significant reduction of his authority, duties
or responsibilities, his removal from office, a reduction in his salary or
material reduction in benefits, or a transfer without his consent to a location
greater than 40 miles from his previous work location), he would receive
compensation comprising one year's salary, up to one-half of one year's salary
as separation pay, vacation pay, any bonus, full vesting of all of his interests
under benefit plans and continuation of his benefits.

     UTI directors and executive officers beneficially owned, as of the record
date, approximately   % of the outstanding UTI common stock, including those
shares of UTI common stock underlying outstanding stock options and warrants.

     Patterson Directors and Executive Officers.  All outstanding unvested stock
options that Patterson has granted to its employees and those of its
subsidiaries under its 1993 stock incentive plan, including those stock options
granted to the three management members of Patterson's board of directors and
one other executive officer of Patterson, vest upon a change of control. The
merger will constitute a change of control under the plan. A total of not more
than 1,674,140 unvested stock options under the plan will become vested and
therefore exercisable as a result of the merger. Information follows concerning
those stock options held by the three management board members and one other
executive officer that will vest as a result of the merger.

                                                                           TOTAL OPTIONS
                                                                            VESTED UPON

                                       Financial Officer

     The Patterson board of directors was aware of these interests and took them
into account in approving the merger.

     The Patterson directors and executive officers beneficially owned, as of
the record date, approximately   % of the outstanding shares of Patterson common
stock, including those shares of Patterson common stock underlying outstanding
stock options.

ACCOUNTING TREATMENT

     We intend to account for the merger as a pooling-of-interests for financial
reporting purposes. Under this method of accounting, the recorded assets and
liabilities of Patterson and UTI will be carried forward to Patterson-UTI, at
their historical amounts, and income of Patterson-UTI will include income for
the entire fiscal year in which the merger occurs, as well as for prior periods.

     The unaudited combined pro forma data for the merger included in this joint
proxy statement/ prospectus has been prepared using the pooling-of-interests
method of accounting. See "Unaudited Pro Forma Combined Financial Statements."

     The merger agreement provides that it is a condition to the obligations of
Patterson and UTI that certain affiliates of Patterson and UTI execute a written
agreement at the effective time of the merger to the effect that they have not
transferred shares of Patterson common stock or shares of UTI common stock
within the preceding 30 days and will not transfer any shares of Patterson
common stock or shares of UTI common stock prior to the date that Patterson-UTI
publishes financial statements that reflect 30 days of operations of
Patterson-UTI (which written agreements relate to the ability of Patterson-UTI
to account for the merger as a pooling-of-interests).

REGULATORY APPROVALS

     Under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act, the merger may not be completed unless
Patterson, UTI and REMY Capital Partners III, L.P., a UTI stockholder, file
Notification and Report forms with the Federal Trade Commission and the
Antitrust Division of the U.S. Department of Justice and certain waiting periods
expire or are terminated. On February 22, 2001, Patterson, UTI and REMY Capital
submitted the regulatory filings to the Federal Trade Commission and the
Antitrust Division. The waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act will
expire on March 26, 2001, unless each party receives early termination of the
waiting period before that time. The waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino
Act may be extended

by receipt of a request for additional information or documentary material from
either the Antitrust Division or the Federal Trade Commission until the
expiration of 30 days after both Patterson and UTI are in substantial compliance
with that request (unless the extended waiting period is terminated early).

     Other than as we describe in this document, the merger does not require the
approval of any other U.S. federal or state or foreign agency.

MANAGEMENT OF PATTERSON-UTI FOLLOWING THE MERGER

     Immediately following the merger, Vincent A. Rossi, Jr. will resign as a
director of Patterson, and the Patterson-UTI board will, by resolution, increase
the Patterson-UTI board to 11 directors. The Patterson-UTI board will then elect
Mark S. Siegel, Vaughn E. Drum, Kenneth N. Berns, Curtis W. Huff and Nadine C.
Smith, all of whom are existing UTI directors, to fill the newly created
vacancies. The 11 board members will serve until the Patterson-UTI 2002 annual
meeting of stockholders or until their successors are elected and qualified.

     The merger agreement does not specify who will be the Chairman of the Board
and the executive officers of Patterson-UTI following the merger. Formal action
with respect to these positions will be taken by the new Patterson-UTI board of
directors promptly following closing of the merger. At the time that our boards
of directors approved the merger agreement, they anticipated that Mark S.
Siegel, Chairman of the Board of UTI, would become Chairman of the Board of
Patterson-UTI, and that Cloyce A. Talbott, Chairman of the Board and Chief
Executive Officer of Patterson, would be the Chief Executive Officer of
Patterson-UTI.

RIGHTS OF DISSENTING STOCKHOLDERS

     Neither the Patterson stockholders nor the UTI stockholders will be
entitled to dissenters' rights under the Delaware General Corporation Law or any
other law in connection with the merger.

DELISTING AND DEREGISTRATION OF UTI COMMON STOCK

     If the merger is completed, the shares of UTI common stock will be delisted
from the American Stock Exchange and will be deregistered under the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934. The stockholders of UTI will become stockholders of
Patterson and their rights as stockholders will be governed by Patterson's
restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws and by the laws of the State of
Delaware. See "Comparison of Stockholders' Rights."

RESALE OF SHARES OF PATTERSON COMMON STOCK ISSUED IN THE MERGER

     The shares of Patterson common stock issued to UTI stockholders in the
merger will be freely transferable under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended,
except for shares issued to holders of UTI common stock who are considered to be
"affiliates" of UTI under Rule 145 of the Securities Act, or of Patterson under
Rule 144 of the Securities Act. The definition of "affiliate" is complex and
depends on the specific facts, but generally includes directors, executive
officers, 10% stockholders and other persons with the power to direct the
management and policies of the company in question.

     Under applicable securities regulations, affiliates of UTI may not sell the
shares of Patterson common stock received in the merger except:

     - pursuant to an effective registration statement under the Securities Act,

     - in compliance with an exemption from the registration requirements of the
       Securities Act, or

     - in compliance with Rule 145 under the Securities Act.

Generally, those rules permit resales of shares received by UTI affiliates
during the year following the completion of the merger, so long as Patterson has
complied with certain reporting requirements and the selling stockholder
complies with certain volume and manner of sale restrictions, and freely
thereafter.

     Sales or transfers of shares of Patterson common stock by such UTI
affiliates, or by affiliates of Patterson, during the 30 days prior to the
merger and until Patterson-UTI announces or files a report with the SEC that
sets forth the combined financial results of Patterson-UTI for a period of at
least 30 days of combined operations following the date on which the merger is
completed may also adversely affect qualification of the merger as a
pooling-of-interests for accounting purposes.

     Patterson and UTI have agreed to deliver to each other at least 30 days
prior to the special meetings a signed agreement by each person that may be
deemed to be an affiliate of Patterson or UTI to the effect that the person will
not sell, transfer or otherwise dispose of his shares of UTI or Patterson common
stock, or options to purchase such shares, during the 30 days prior to
completion of the merger. Each person will also agree in that signed agreement
that, following the merger, the person will not sell, transfer or otherwise
dispose of the shares of Patterson common stock received by the person in the
merger except in compliance with the applicable provisions of the Securities Act
and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder and only after Patterson
announces or files a report with the SEC that sets forth the combined financial
results of Patterson and UTI for a period of at least 30 days of combined
operations following the date on which the merger was completed.

     This joint proxy statement/prospectus does not cover any resales of shares
of Patterson common stock received by affiliates of UTI.

CERTAIN UNITED STATES FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSEQUENCES

     In General.  The following discussion summarizes certain U.S. federal
income tax consequences of the merger. Tax consequences which are different from
or in addition to those described herein may apply to UTI stockholders who are
subject to special treatment under the U.S. federal income tax laws, such as
non-U.S. persons, tax exempt organizations, financial institutions, insurance
companies, broker-dealers, UTI stockholders who hold their UTI common stock as
part of a hedge, straddle, wash sale, synthetic security, conversion
transaction, or other integrated investment comprised of UTI common stock and
one or more other investments, persons with a "functional currency" (as defined
in the Internal Revenue Code) other than the U.S. dollar, and persons who
acquired their shares of UTI common stock in compensatory transactions. The
discussion does not address non-U.S. or state or local tax considerations.
Moreover, the tax consequences to holders of UTI stock options and UTI warrants
are not discussed.

     THIS SUMMARY IS NOT A SUBSTITUTE FOR AN INDIVIDUAL ANALYSIS OF THE TAX
CONSEQUENCES OF THE MERGER TO YOU. YOU SHOULD CONSULT A TAX ADVISOR REGARDING
THE PARTICULAR FEDERAL, STATE, LOCAL AND NON-U.S. TAX CONSEQUENCES OF THE MERGER
IN LIGHT OF YOUR OWN SITUATION.

     It is a condition precedent to the closing of the merger that opinions of
Baker & Hostetler LLP and Fulbright & Jaworski L.L.P. be delivered to Patterson
and UTI, respectively, to the effect that the merger qualifies as a
reorganization under Section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code. The opinions
will be subject to certain qualifications and assumptions as noted therein. In
addition, the opinions will be based in part upon representations of Patterson
and UTI provided to counsel, which counsel will assume to be true, correct and
complete. If the representations are inaccurate, the opinions could be adversely
affected. The opinions will also be based upon counsel's interpretation of the
Internal Revenue Code, applicable Treasury regulations, judicial authority and
administrative rulings and practice, all as of the date of the opinions. There
can be no assurance that future legislative, judicial or administrative changes
or interpretations will not adversely affect the accuracy of the conclusions set
forth herein. No ruling has been requested or received from the Internal Revenue
Service. The opinions will not be binding upon the Internal Revenue Service or
any court, and neither the Internal Revenue Service nor any court will be
precluded from adopting a contrary position.

     Assuming the merger qualifies as a reorganization under Section 368(a) of
the Internal Revenue Code, the U.S. federal income tax consequences will include
the following:

     - Patterson and UTI will each be a party to such reorganization within the
       meaning of Section 368(b) of the Internal Revenue Code;

     - No gain or loss will be recognized by Patterson, UTI or holders of shares
       of Patterson common stock as a result of the merger;

     - No gain or loss will be recognized by holders of UTI common stock solely
       upon their receipt in the merger of Patterson common stock in exchange
       therefor;

     - The aggregate tax basis of the shares of Patterson common stock received
       by a UTI stockholder in the merger will be the same as the aggregate tax
       basis of the shares of UTI common stock surrendered in exchange therefor;
       and

     - The holding period of the shares of Patterson common stock received by a
       UTI stockholder in the merger will include the holding period of the
       shares of UTI common stock surrendered in exchange therefor, provided
       that such shares of UTI common stock are held as capital assets at the
       effective time of the merger.

     In the event that the merger were held not to qualify as a reorganization
under Section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code, UTI would recognize gain or
loss on the transfer of its assets to Patterson and each UTI stockholder would
recognize gain or loss in an amount equal to the difference between the tax
basis in such UTI stockholder's shares of UTI common stock and the fair market
value, as of the effective date of the merger, of the shares of Patterson common
stock received in exchange therefor. In such event, such UTI stockholder's tax
basis in the shares of Patterson common stock so received would be equal to
their fair market value as of the effective date of the merger, and the holding
period for such shares of Patterson common stock would begin on the day after
the effective date of the merger.

     Information Reporting; Records.  Each UTI stockholder will be required to
retain records and file with such UTI stockholder's United States federal income
tax return a statement setting forth certain facts relating to the merger.

     THE UNITED STATES FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSEQUENCES SUMMARIZED ABOVE ARE FOR
GENERAL INFORMATION ONLY. YOU SHOULD CONSULT A TAX ADVISOR AS TO THE PARTICULAR
CONSEQUENCES OF THE MERGER THAT MAY APPLY TO YOU, INCLUDING THE APPLICATION OF
STATE, LOCAL, NON-U.S. AND OTHER FEDERAL TAX LAWS.

                              THE MERGER AGREEMENT

     The following is a summary of the material provisions of the merger
agreement, a copy of which is attached as Annex A to this document and is
incorporated in this document by reference. This summary is qualified in its
entirety by reference to the full text of the merger agreement. You should read
the merger agreement because it, and not this document, is the legal document
that governs the merger.

THE MERGER

     Upon the terms and conditions of the merger agreement, and in accordance
with the Delaware General Corporation Law, at the effective time, UTI will merge
with and into Patterson. Patterson will continue as the surviving corporation
under the name Patterson-UTI Energy, Inc., if the proposed amendment to its
restated certificate of incorporation is approved by stockholders at the
Patterson special meeting or, if not approved, under its existing name.

     The closing date of the merger will occur no later than the second business
day following the date on which all conditions to the merger, other than those
conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the closing, have been
satisfied or waived, unless the parties agree on another time. Contemporaneously
with the closing, Patterson and UTI will file a certificate of merger with the
Secretary of State of the State of Delaware. The effective time of the merger
will be the time Patterson and UTI file the certificate of merger with the
Secretary of State of the State of Delaware or at a later time as we may agree,
but in no case later than 30 days following the date on which the certificate of
merger is filed.

     As a result of the merger, UTI will be merged with and into Patterson and
the separate corporate existence of UTI will cease.

MERGER CONSIDERATION

     Exchange Ratio.  Each outstanding share of common stock, stock option or
warrant for UTI common stock shall be exchanged as follows:

     - at the effective time of the merger, each outstanding whole share of UTI
       common stock (other than shares of UTI common stock held by UTI or any of
       its subsidiaries, which will be canceled and retired without the right to
       receive any consideration in exchange therefor) will be converted into
       the right to receive one share of Patterson common stock;

     - at the effective time of the merger, each outstanding warrant to purchase
       or acquire whole shares of UTI common stock will be converted into a
       warrant to purchase an equal number of shares of Patterson common stock
       at the same exercise price per share; and

     - each of the outstanding UTI stock options will be converted into a
       Patterson stock option as follows:

         - prior to the effective time of the merger, each stock option will be
           exercisable for that number of shares of UTI common stock covered by
           the UTI stock option at an exercise price per share equal to the
           exercise price of the UTI common stock; and

         - after the effective time of the merger, each converted stock option
           will be exercisable for that number of shares of Patterson common
           stock equal to the number of whole shares of UTI common stock covered
           by the UTI stock option. The converted options will be exercisable
           upon the same terms and conditions applied to the UTI stock options
           before the effective time of the merger, after giving effect to any
           existing provision in any UTI stock plan that provides for the
           automatic acceleration of vesting upon a change in control of UTI.

     Patterson has agreed to reserve for issuance the number of shares of
Patterson common stock that will become issuable upon the exercise of the UTI
stock options. Patterson has agreed to prepare and file a registration statement
and, if necessary, a "reoffer prospectus" with the Securities and Exchange
Commission with respect to the shares of Patterson common stock subject to the
converted options, and to

use its best efforts to keep the reoffer prospectus and its amendments effective
for so long as the converted options remain outstanding.

EXCHANGE PROCEDURES

     UTI Stockholders Should Not Send in Their UTI Stock Certificates Until They
Receive The Letter of Transmittal.  As soon as reasonably practicable after the
effective time of the merger, an exchange agent will mail a letter of
transmittal to each holder of record of UTI common stock certificates. This
letter of transmittal must be used in surrendering UTI stock certificates to the
exchange agent for cancellation. Upon surrender of a UTI stock certificate for
cancellation, together with a duly executed letter of transmittal and any other
documents that the exchange agent may reasonably require, the holder of the UTI
common stock certificate will be entitled to receive in exchange therefor (a) a
Patterson certificate representing the number of whole shares of Patterson
common stock that the holder has the right to receive, and (b) any unpaid
dividends and distributions, if any, that the holder has the right to receive
pursuant to the merger agreement, after giving effect to any required
withholding tax.

     After the effective time of the merger, each UTI common stock certificate,
until surrendered and exchanged, will represent only the right to receive a
certificate representing Patterson common stock and unpaid dividends and
distributions, if any. Holders of UTI stock certificates will not be entitled to
receive any dividends or other distributions with respect to Patterson common
stock declared or made by Patterson having a record date after the effective
time of the merger until the UTI common stock certificates are surrendered.
Subject to applicable law, following surrender of the UTI common stock
certificates, such dividends and distributions, if any, will be paid without
interest.

     The merger agreement contains customary and substantially reciprocal

     - to provide officers and employees of UTI, who continue as Patterson
       employees, with employee benefits under plans and programs, which, in the

       except where amounts paid in settlement do not exceed $200,000, exclusive
       of insured amounts; or

     - authorize or enter into any agreement to do any of the foregoing.

NO SOLICITATION

     Each party has agreed that it will not, and will use its best efforts to
cause the officers, directors, employees, attorneys, financial advisors, agents
and other representatives and those of any of its subsidiaries to not:

     - directly or indirectly, solicit, initiate or knowingly encourage, or
       otherwise intentionally knowingly facilitate, any inquiries or the making
       of any proposal that constitutes a third party "acquisition proposal" of
       the type described below; or

     - directly or indirectly engage in any negotiations concerning, provide any
       confidential information or data to, or have any discussion with, a
       person or entity regarding a third party acquisition proposal of the type
       described below.

     However, each party is permitted to:

     - comply with Rule 14e-2 promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of
       1934 with regard to an acquisition proposal of the type described below;
       or

     - furnish information to, or enter into discussions or negotiations with,
       any person or entity in connection with an unsolicited, bona fide,
       written acquisition proposal of the type described below obtained before
       stockholder approval of the merger, or recommend the same to its
       stockholders, if, and only to the extent that:

         - the party's board of directors, after consultation with legal
           counsel, determines in good faith that such action is required for
           the board of directors to comply with its fiduciary duties to its
           stockholders as imposed by the Delaware General Corporation Law; and

         - before furnishing information, the party's board of directors
           receives an executed confidentiality agreement. The terms of the
           confidentiality agreement must be no less favorable to the other
           party and no less restrictive on the person requesting the
           information than the confidentiality agreement executed by the
           parties to the merger agreement; and

         - before entering into discussions or negotiations with or recommending
           the acquisition proposal, the party's board of directors determine in
           good faith and after consultation with its financial advisor that, in
           light of the information furnished to it relating to such acquisition
           proposal, the acquisition proposal contemplated is reasonably likely
           to be consummated (taking into account all legal, financial and
           regulatory aspects of the proposal) and, if consummated, would result
           in a transaction more favorable to that party's stockholders from a
           financial point of view than the transaction contemplated by the
           merger agreement.

     Each party agrees to promptly notify the other upon receipt of any
inquiries, proposals or offers related to or constituting an acquisition
proposal and will thereafter keep the other informed of its status and terms.
The notice will include the name of the person making, and the material terms
of, the inquiry, proposal or offer.

     As used herein, "acquisition proposal" means any proposal or offer with
respect to a merger, reorganization, share exchange, consolidation or similar
transaction involving, or any purchase of all or a substantial portion of the
assets or any equity securities of a party to the merger agreement or any of its
subsidiaries, other than the proposed merger described herein.

       Section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986.

or waive compliance with any conditions or agreements by the other party that
may be legally waived.

                             INFORMATION ABOUT UTI

BUSINESS

     UTI is a leading provider of onshore contract drilling services to
companies that explore for and produce oil and natural gas. UTI's drilling rigs
operate in the oil and natural gas producing basins of the states of Texas, New
Mexico, Oklahoma and Louisiana and in the provinces of Alberta, British Columbia
and Saskatchewan, Canada. As of February 9, 2001, UTI had a drilling fleet of
150 land drilling rigs, of which 111 were "active rigs," which are rigs that
were generating revenue. UTI also provides pressure pumping services in the
Appalachian basin.

     Beginning in 1995, UTI decided to expand its land drilling operations. To
effect this strategy, UTI disposed of its oilfield distribution business in
September 1995 and embarked on an acquisition program aimed at expanding UTI's
presence in the oil and natural gas producing regions in the United States.
Under this strategy, UTI has acquired 132 rigs since 1995. During this same time
period, UTI disposed of nine rigs primarily in the Appalachian Basin. UTI sold
five of the nine disposed rigs in 1999.

     Due to UTI's acquisitions of drilling rigs and favorable market conditions,
UTI has experienced a significant increase in revenues over the last few years.
In 2000, UTI had revenues from operations of $275,543,000, as compared to
$155,775,000 in 1999 and $186,157,000 in 1998.

     UTI's land drilling customers include major oil companies and various sized
independent producers. UTI follows a policy of keeping its drilling rigs
technologically competitive and well maintained and also continuously maintains
its pressure pumping equipment.

     UTI's rigs can drill to depths ranging from 8,000 to 30,000 feet. During

BOARD AND COMMITTEE MEETINGS

     The UTI board of directors has an executive committee, a compensation
committee and an audit committee. The UTI board of directors has not established
a nominating committee.

     The executive committee, which is composed of Messrs. Drum and Siegel, has
the authority to act for the UTI board in all matters permitted to be delegated
to it by law that arise between regular and special meetings of the UTI board.
The executive committee met informally on numerous occasions during the year
ended December 31, 2000.

     The UTI compensation committee, which is composed of Messrs. Hunt and
Spears, administers the employee stock option plan and similar plans of UTI and
determines the annual compensation to be paid to the executive officers of UTI.
The UTI compensation committee met one time during the fiscal year ended
December 31, 2000. The UTI compensation committee's report on executive
compensation for the fiscal year 2000 appears below.

     The UTI audit committee, is charged with recommending to the entire UTI
board the engagement and discharge of independent auditors of the financial
statements of UTI, reviewing the professional service provided by independent
auditors, reviewing the independence of independent auditors, reviewing with the
auditors the plan and results of the audit engagement, considering the range of
audit and non-audit fees, reviewing the adequacy of UTI's system of internal
accounting controls, reviewing the results of procedures for internal auditing
and consulting with the internal auditor of UTI with respect to all aspects of

fiscal year ended December 31, 2000. The UTI audit committee's report appears
below.

     The UTI board of directors met five times during the fiscal year ended
December 31, 2000. Each director attended, in person or by telephone, at least
75% of the meetings held by the UTI board of directors and by the committees on
which the director served.

AUDIT COMMITTEE REPORT

     The UTI audit committee has reviewed and discussed UTI's audited financial
statements for the year ended December 31, 2000 with management. The UTI audit
committee also discussed with Ernst & Young LLP, certified public accountants,
the independent auditors and accountants for UTI, the matters required to be
discussed by SAS 61 (Codification of Statements on Auditing Standards, AU
Section 380) with respect to those statements.

     The UTI audit committee has received the written disclosures and the letter
from Ernst & Young LLP required by Independence Standards Board Standard No. 1
(Independence Standards Board Standard No. 1, Independence Discussions with
Audit Committees) and have discussed with Ernst & Young LLP its independence in
connection with its audit of UTI's most recent financial statements. Based on
this review and these discussions, the UTI audit committee recommended to the
UTI board of directors that these audited financial statements be included in
UTI's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2000.

     Kenneth N. Berns, Robert B. Spears and Nadine C. Smith are the members of
the UTI audit committee. Mr. Spears and Ms. Smith are independent, as defined in
Section 121(B)(b)(ii) of the American Stock Exchange's listing standards. Mr.
Berns is not independent as defined in that rule because he is an employee of
and received compensation in excess of $60,000 from UTI. In addition, Mr. Berns
is an executive employee of and received compensation in excess of $60,000
during fiscal year 2000 from, REMY Investors & Consultants Incorporated, a
beneficial owner of greater than 10% of the outstanding shares of UTI common
stock. The UTI board of directors has, nonetheless, determined that Mr. Berns'
membership on the UTI audit committee is required by the best interests of UTI
and its stockholders. The UTI board determined that Mr. Berns' relationship with
this beneficial owner of UTI common stock does not in any way impair his
independence from UTI's management. To the contrary, Mr. Berns provides
substantial, direct stockholder representation on the UTI audit committee.

     The UTI board of directors has adopted a written charter for the UTI audit
committee, a copy of which is attached to this joint proxy statement/prospectus
as Annex F.

     The information in the foregoing four paragraphs shall not be deemed to be
soliciting material, or to be filed with the SEC or subject to Regulation 14A or

deemed to be incorporated by reference into any filing under the Securities Act
or the Exchange Act, except to the extent that we specifically incorporate these
paragraphs by reference.

  Compensation Pursuant to Employee Benefit Plans

     UTI maintains several plans intended to provide incentives to its key
employees. These plans are described below:

     Incentive Compensation Plan.  UTI maintains an Incentive Compensation Plan
under which certain employees of UTI and its subsidiaries may be eligible to
receive a cash bonus following each calendar year based on a comparison of
financial performance against targets established for each plan year. In
addition, certain corporate office employees may receive annual bonuses on a
discretionary basis.

     Norton 1997 Stock Option Plan.  In July of 1999, UTI acquired Norton
Drilling Services, Inc. Norton Drilling Services, Inc. had a stock option plan
which UTI assumed. The options vest over three years. No further shares of
common stock are available for grant under the plan.

     1996 Employee Stock Option Plan.  In August 1996, UTI's stockholders
approved UTI's 1996 employee stock option plan. Under the this plan, UTI can
award options on up to 1,800,000 shares of common stock to certain employees of
UTI and its subsidiaries at a price equal to the fair market value of the stock
at the date the option is granted. In August of 1998 certain of the options were
repriced to the fair market value on the date of repricing. During 1999 and
2000, UTI awarded options to purchase 178,000 shares of common stock under the
1996 Plan. The 1996 employee stock option plan currently is administered by
UTI's compensation committee, and there are 12,600 shares of common stock
available for grant under the 1996 Plan.

     1997 Long-Term Incentive Plan.  In August 1997, UTI's stockholders approved
UTI's 1997 long-term incentive plan. Under this plan, UTI may grant stock
options, stock appreciation rights issued independent or in tandem with such
options, restricted stock awards and performance awards to certain employees of
UTI and its subsidiaries. In August of 1998, certain of the options were
repriced to the fair market value on the date of repricing. In June 1999, UTI's
stockholders increased the number of shares of common stock authorized for
issuance under the 1997 long-term incentive plan from 1,200,000 to 3,000,000. In
July 2000, UTI's stockholders increased the number of shares of common stock
authorized for issuance under the 1997 plan from 3,000,000 to 3,800,000. Options
are to be granted at a price not less than the fair market value of the common
stock on the date the option is granted. During 1999 and 2000, UTI awarded
options to purchase 1,563,000 shares of common stock. The options that have been
granted under the this plan vest over zero to five years. The 1997 long-term
incentive plan currently is administered by UTI's compensation committee, and
there are currently 1,214,800 shares of common stock available for grant.

DIRECTOR COMPENSATION

     Directors who are employees of UTI do not receive any additional
compensation for serving as a director or as a member of a committee of the UTI
board of directors. UTI's non-employee directors are each entitled to receive:

     - an annual retainer fee of $5,000;

     - $700 for each regular or special board of directors meeting attended; and

     - $500 for each committee meeting attended.

     All UTI directors have been and will be reimbursed for reasonable
out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection with attendance at board of
directors meetings and committee meetings.

     UTI maintains a non-employee director stock option plan. Under this
director plan:

     - options to purchase up to an aggregate of 600,000 shares of UTI common
       stock may be granted;

     - the purchase price per share shall be equal to the fair market value of
       UTI common stock as of the date of the grant;

     - a grant of an option to purchase 15,000 shares of UTI common stock is
       awarded to each non-employee director as of the date he or she is first
       elected;

     - automatic grants of an option to purchase 7,500 shares of UTI common
       stock occur on December 31 of each year to each non-employee director who
       has served for a period of at least one year;

     - options to purchase 30,000 shares of UTI common stock were awarded
       pursuant to this provision in 2000;

     - no options will be granted after December 18, 2005; and

     - all options issued expire five years from the date of grant.

     Messrs. Siegel, Berns and Drum each participate in UTI's 1996 Employee
Stock Option Plan and the 1997 Long-Term Incentive Plan and receive salaries in
their capacities as employees of UTI.

COMPENSATION COMMITTEE REPORT

     Annual Salaries and Other Cash Compensation.  In November 1997, the UTI
board of directors delegated to the UTI compensation committee the
responsibility to administer UTI's stock option plans and to determine
compensation levels for the executive officers. Prior to such time, the UTI
board of directors had administered UTI's stock option plans and had approved
compensation levels for the executive officers based upon recommendations of the
UTI compensation committee.

     In considering the amount and form of compensation to be provided for the
executive officers of UTI, the UTI compensation committee took into
consideration:

     - the size of UTI;

     - UTI's financial results and condition;

     - the nature of UTI's business;

     - business conditions in the oil and gas field services and supplies
       industries;

     - UTI's competitive position in the labor market for skilled executives;
       and

     - amounts paid by other firms to attract and retain executives of
       comparable competence and experience.

     UTI has sought to provide salaries that are competitive but not excessive
and to provide incentive compensation, in the form of performance related
bonuses under the UTI incentive compensation plan, to encourage executive
performance. The incentive compensation plan also is intended to diminish, for
successful employees, any potential competitive shortfall in their cash
compensation.

     The compensation of Mr. Drum, UTI's President and Chief Executive Officer,
was established to reflect the views of UTI's board and compensation committee
regarding his experience and performance, and the performance of UTI in light of
prevailing competitive conditions. The UTI compensation committee believes that
Mr. Drum is primarily responsible for the implementation of UTI board policies.
Mr. Drum has been effective in integrating acquisitions and positioning UTI to
take advantage of

improvements in demand and prices for UTI's services as they occur. Mr. Drum's
compensation is intended to reflect these views and to provide him incentives to
continue his successful leadership of UTI. In March 2000, Mr. Drum's annual
salary was increased to $225,000.

     Compensation Pursuant to Employee Benefit Plans.  It is the general policy
of UTI to review stock-based compensation on an annual basis. Awards of
stock-based compensation reflect the UTI board's and compensation committee's
desire to provide UTI employees who have substantial responsibility for UTI's
management and growth with additional incentives by increasing their proprietary
interest in the success of UTI. The decision whether to grant stock options to
any particular employee is based upon a variety of factors, including position,
performance, current share and stock option ownership and the need to insure the
continued employment of the employee with UTI. Grants of 501,000 stock options
were made to UTI's employees during 2000.

     Section 162(m) Deduction Limitation.  Section 162(m) of the Internal
Revenue Code imposes a limitation on deductions that can be taken by a publicly
held corporation for compensation paid to certain of its executive officers.
Under Section 162(m), a deduction is denied for compensation paid in a tax year
beginning on or after January 1, 1994, to the named executive officers to the
extent that such compensation exceeds $1 million per individual. Stock option
grants pursuant to UTI's employee benefit plans may be exempt from the deduction
limit if certain requirements are met. The UTI board of directors and the
compensation committee has considered the effect of Section 162(m) on UTI's
existing compensation program.

          The UTI Compensation Committee of the UTI Board of Directors

                               Mr. Terry H. Hunt
                              Mr. Robert B. Spears

EMPLOYMENT CONTRACTS AND CHANGE-IN-CONTROL ARRANGEMENTS

     UTI has an employment agreement with Mr. Drum. The annual salary currently
payable under such agreement is $225,000, which may be increased by UTI's board
of directors or the compensation committee. In addition, the agreement provides
that UTI's board of directors, in its discretion, may determine to pay Mr. Drum
additional compensation in the form of bonuses or incentive compensation. The
agreement has an initial term of five years continuing through December 2000,
and automatically extends for an additional year upon the completion of the
five-year term unless either party provides notice to the other of the intention
to terminate such contract 120 days prior to the termination date. In addition,
the employment agreement entitles Mr. Drum to receive four weeks paid vacation
per year and to participate fully in all employee plans and fringe benefit
programs established by UTI after the date of the contract in which other senior
executives of UTI are eligible to participate.

     In the event of a termination due to Mr. Drum's death or disability, his
estate is entitled to receive:

     - unused vacation pay;

     - a pro-rated portion of any bonus;

     - separation payment not more than 50% of his compensation in the most
       recent calendar year; and

     - vesting of all of his interests, under UTI stock option plans and any
       other employee plans of UTI.

     In the event Mr. Drum retires in accordance with UTI's retirement policies,
he is entitled to receive:

     - unused vacation pay;

     - a pro-rated portion of any bonus;

     - a separation payment; and

     - vesting of all of his interests in UTI's option or employee plans, but
       only to the extent provided in UTI's employee benefit plans for retiring
       employees.

     If Mr. Drum is terminated by UTI without cause, or if he terminates his
employment after an adverse change, he is entitled to receive:

     - termination pay of one year's salary;

     - unused vacation pay;

     - a separation payment;

     - the full amount of any bonus;

     - vesting of all of his interests in UTI's option or employee plans; and

     - continuation of all employee benefits, without any increase in cost to
       him, for a period of 18 months following termination.

     An adverse change is a significant reduction of his authority, duties or
responsibilities, his removal from office, a reduction in his salary or material
reduction in benefits, or a transfer without his consent to a location greater
than 40 miles from his previous work location. In connection with UTI's
relocation of its corporate headquarters from Wayne, Pennsylvania to Houston,
Texas, UTI agreed to provide relocation assistance if and when Mr. Drum's
employment with UTI is terminated.

     In 1997, the compensation committee approved employment arrangements with
Messrs. Siegel and Berns providing for annual salaries of $100,000 and $50,000
for a period of five years. Effective February 20, 2000, the annual salaries of
Messrs. Siegel and Berns increased to $125,000 and $90,000, respectively. UTI
also has an employment arrangement with Mr. Vollmer. In the event of a change in
control of UTI, UTI's obligation to pay such salaries would end and Messrs.
Siegel, Berns and Vollmer would each be entitled to payment of one year's salary
and Messrs. Siegel and Berns would be entitled to vesting of all options granted
in connection with such employment arrangements. Pursuant to the terms of Mr.
Vollmer's option agreements, the options vest on a change of control. Messrs.
Siegel and Berns are entitled to receive bonuses for extraordinary services
solely within the discretion of the board of directors and compensation
committee.

COMPENSATION COMMITTEE INTERLOCKS AND INSIDER PARTICIPATION

     Prior to November 1997, grants of stock options to UTI's executive officers
and Messrs. Siegel and Berns as well as salary levels of UTI's executive
officers were approved by the full UTI board of directors. In November 1997, the
UTI board of directors delegated these responsibilities to the UTI compensation
committee, which is comprised of Messrs. Hunt and Spears. Although the full UTI
board of directors authorized the repricing of options during 1998 (with Messrs.
Siegel, Drum and Berns abstaining), it is intended that the compensation
committee will determine compensation awarded to UTI's executive officers, as
well as Messrs. Siegel and Berns, in the future.

CERTAIN RELATIONSHIPS AND RELATED TRANSACTIONS

     In connection with REMY Capital Partners III, L.P.'s acquisition of its
ownership interest in UTI in March 1995, REMY Capital succeeded to a
registration rights agreement with UTI which provides REMY Capital with the
right to require UTI to use its best efforts to register shares held by REMY
Capital under the Securities Act. In the event that such rights are exercised in
connection with a primary offering proposed by UTI (or a secondary offering with
which UTI agrees to participate), REMY Capital would bear its pro rata share of
the costs of the offering, other than legal, accounting and printing costs which
UTI shall bear. In the event that REMY Capital elected to exercise such rights
otherwise than in

connection with an offering proposed by UTI, REMY Capital would bear all costs
of the offering. These rights continue so long as REMY capital continues to own
the common stock that it acquired.

     Mr. Siegel, Chairman of the Board of UTI, is President and sole stockholder
of REMY Investors, which is the general partner of REMY Capital. Mr. Berns, a
director and employee of UTI, is an employee of REMY Investors.

COMPLIANCE WITH SECTION 16(a) OF THE EXCHANGE ACT

     Section 16(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 requires UTI's
officers and directors and persons who beneficially own more than ten percent of
a registered class of UTI's equity securities to file reports of ownership and
changes in ownership with the SEC. Officers, directors and greater than ten
percent stockholders are required by the regulations promulgated under Section
16(a) to furnish UTI with copies of all Section 16(a) forms they file.

     Based solely on its review of the copies of such forms received by it, or
written representations from certain reporting persons that no Forms 5 were
required for those persons. UTI believes that, during 2000, all filing
requirements applicable to officers, directors, and greater than ten percent
stockholders were complied with.

                          INFORMATION ABOUT PATTERSON

BUSINESS

     Patterson is one of the leading providers of domestic land drilling
services to major and independent oil and natural gas companies. Formed in 1978
and reincorporated in 1993 as a Delaware corporation, Patterson conducts
operations in Texas, New Mexico, Oklahoma, Louisiana, Mississippi and Utah.
Patterson has a drilling fleet of 152 rigs, 140 of which are currently
"marketable." Marketable rigs are rigs that are fully operable. Patterson
provides drilling and completion fluid services to other oil and natural gas
operators and also engages in the development, exploration, acquisition and
production of oil and natural gas.

     Patterson has established its reputation for reliable, high quality
drilling equipment and well-trained crews. Patterson continually seeks to modify
and upgrade its equipment to maximize the performance and capabilities of its
drilling rig fleet, which it believes provides it with a competitive advantage.
Additionally, Patterson has the in-house capability to design, manufacture,
repair, and modify its drilling rigs.

     Of Patterson's drilling rigs, 95 are capable of drilling to depths of
12,000 feet and greater, including 52 that are capable of drilling to 15,000
feet and greater. During 2000, Patterson drilled 1,485 wells for 224
non-affiliated customers maintaining an average utilization rate of 74%.

     Patterson's oil and natural gas activities are designed to complement its
land drilling operations and diversify its overall business strategy. These
activities are primarily focused in mature producing regions in the Permian
Basin and South Texas. Oil and natural gas operations comprised approximately 5%
of Patterson's consolidated operation revenues during 2000. At December 31,
2000, Patterson's proven developed reserves were approximately 1.8 million
barrels of oil equivalent, and it had a present value (discounted at 10% before
income taxes) of estimated future net revenues of approximately $22.8 million.

     Patterson's drilling and completion fluid services are provided to
operators of oil and gas wells located in its areas of operation, as well as in
the Gulf of Mexico. Operating revenues derived from these activities constituted
approximately 10% of Patterson's consolidated operating revenues for 2000.
Patterson believes that these services integrate well with its other core
operating activities. The drilling fluid operations began in 1998 with the
acquisition of Lone Star Mud, Inc., and Tejas Drilling Fluids, Inc. More
recently, in October 2000, Patterson acquired the fluids division of Ambar,
Inc., with drilling and completion fluids operations in the Gulf of Mexico,
Louisiana, and South Texas.

     Patterson had 3,062 employees at December 31, 2000. Patterson's
headquarters are located at 4510 Lamesa Highway, Snyder, Texas, and its
telephone number at that address is (915) 573-1104. Patterson also has small
offices in Austin, Houston, Midland, San Angelo, Kilgore, LaGrange and Corpus
Christi, Texas, and Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, Vernal, Utah, Lafayette, Louisiana,
and Hobbs, New Mexico, and 26 yard and stockpoint facilities variously located
in its areas of operations.

seven members. Pursuant to the merger agreement, the number of members of
Patterson's board will be increased by board resolution to eleven members if the
merger is consummated. Six of these members will be chosen by Patterson's board
of directors, while five will be chosen by UTI's board of directors. The board
of directors of Patterson-UTI after the merger will serve until the annual
meeting of Patterson-UTI stockholders in 2002, or until their successors are
elected and qualified.

     If the merger is not consummated, as soon as practicable after its special
meeting Patterson will hold an annual meeting of its stockholders to elect a
board of directors.

     The following table sets forth certain information concerning the
individuals who are currently serving as Patterson's board of directors and/or

management as to compensation for officers and other employees and to administer
Patterson's 1993 stock incentive plan. The audit committee held two formal
meetings during 2000 and the compensation committee held one formal meeting
during 2000. The board of directors has adopted an audit committee charter, a

DIRECTOR COMPENSATION

     Each non-employee director of Patterson receives a $1,000 per month fee as
partial compensation for services as board members. In addition, pursuant to
Patterson's non-employee directors' stock option plan, each non-employee
director is automatically granted options to purchase 20,000 shares at the time
he becomes a director and, thereafter, options to purchase an additional 4,000
shares for each subsequent year that he serves up to a maximum of 40,000 shares
per director. The exercise price for each such option is the fair market value
of the Patterson common stock on the date of grant.

COMPENSATION COMMITTEE REPORT

     Under rules established by the Securities and Exchange Commission,
Patterson is required to provide certain information regarding the compensation
of its Chief Executive Officer and other executive officers whose salary and
bonus exceed $100,000 per year. Disclosure requirements include a report
explaining the rationale and considerations that lead to fundamental executive
compensation decisions. The following report has been prepared to fulfill this
requirement.

     The compensation committee sets and administers the policies that govern
the annual compensation and long-term compensation of executive officers of
Patterson. The compensation committee consists of Messrs. Gist, Rossi, Peak and
DeGroat, none of whom are employees of Patterson. The compensation committee
makes all decisions concerning compensation of executive officers who receive
salary and bonus in excess of $100,000 annually, determines the total amount of
bonuses to be paid annually and grants all awards of stock options under
Patterson's 1993 stock incentive plan. The compensation committee has retained
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP to provide executive compensation consulting services
to assist it in performing its various duties. PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP
prepared, in April 2000, a report comparing Patterson's cash compensation
practices for the executive officers to the executive-level cash compensation
practices of similarly-sized companies in Patterson's segment of the oil and
natural gas industry and in general industry.

     The compensation committee's policy is to offer executive officers
competitive compensation packages that will permit Patterson to attract and
retain highly qualified individuals and to motivate and reward such individuals
on the basis of Patterson's performance. At present, Patterson's executive
compensation package consists of base salary, cash bonus awards and long-term
incentive opportunities in the form of

stock options and a 401(k) plan. Executive salaries are reviewed by the
compensation committee on an annual basis and are set for individual executive
officers based on subjective evaluations of each individual's performance,
Patterson's performance and a comparison to salary ranges for executives of
other companies in the oil and natural gas industry with characteristics similar
to those of Patterson. This allows the compensation committee to set salaries in
a manner that is both competitive and reasonable within Patterson's industry.

     Cash bonuses may be awarded on an annual basis for exceptional effort and
performance. The use of a specific formula to evaluate management performance is
not employed because it is difficult to define an appropriate formula and it
restricts the flexibility of the compensation committee. The compensation
committee considers the achievements of Patterson, specifically including
earnings for the year and return on stockholders' equity in determining
appropriate levels for bonus awards. Currently, the base annual salary of each
of the executive officers named in the Summary Compensation Table above is
within the salary parameters set forth in the analysis prepared by
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP.

     Stock options may be granted to key employees under the Patterson Energy,
Inc. 1993 Stock Incentive Plan, including executive officers of Patterson. Such
stock-based awards continue to be an important element of the executive
compensation package because they aid in the objective of aligning the key
employees' interests with those of the stockholders by giving key employees a
direct stake in the performance of Patterson. Decisions concerning the granting
of stock options are made on the same basis as decisions concerning base salary
and cash bonus awards as discussed above. No options were granted in 2000 to any
of the executive officers of Patterson.

     The compensation of the Chief Executive Officer of Patterson is determined
in the same manner as the compensation for other executive officers as described
above. As a result, the compensation of the Chief Executive Officer is largely
dependent upon the overall performance of Patterson as well as a comparison to
compensation being paid by other comparable peer companies to their chief
executive officers. During the year 2000, the base annual salary of Mr. Talbott
was approximately $290,900.

                       Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors:

                         Kenneth R. Peak
                         Stephen J. DeGroat
                         Robert C. Gist
                         Vincent A. Rossi, Jr.

EMPLOYMENT CONTRACTS AND CHANGE-IN-CONTROL ARRANGEMENTS

     None of the executive officers named in the Summary Compensation Table
above has an employment or severance agreement or any plan or arrangement
providing compensation in the event of a change in control of Patterson.

COMPENSATION COMMITTEE INTERLOCKS AND INSIDER PARTICIPATION

     Robert C. Gist, Vincent A. Rossi, Jr. Stephen J. DeGroat and Kenneth R.
Peak served as members of the compensation committee during 2000. Except in his
capacity as a manager of a subsidiary LLC of Patterson for which he receives no
compensation, Mr. Gist has never served as an officer, but has been paid a
monthly retainer of $1,000 since 1993 for legal and consulting services.
Patterson also pays premiums for Mr. Gist's family health insurance coverage.
Messrs. DeGroat, Peak and Rossi have not served as an officer of Patterson.
After joining the board in November 2000, Messrs. Peak and DeGroat were
appointed by the board to the compensation committee and the audit committee.

CERTAIN RELATIONSHIPS AND RELATED TRANSACTIONS

     Patterson leases a 1981 Beech King-Air 90 airplane owned by an affiliate of
Patterson's Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer. Under the terms
of the lease, Patterson pays a monthly rental of

$9,200 and its proportionate share of the costs of fuel, insurance, taxes and
maintenance of the aircraft. Patterson paid approximately $211,495, $222,583 and
$193,769 for the lease of the airplane during 1998, 1999 and 2000, respectively.

     Certain of Patterson's affiliated persons have participated, either
individually or through entities they control, in oil and gas prospects or
properties in which Patterson has an interest. Affiliated persons are directors,
executive officers and key employees of Patterson and their family members.
These participations, which have been on a working interest basis, have been in
prospects or properties originated or acquired by Patterson. In substantially
every property in which any of these affiliated persons has been a working
interest participant, Patterson also has sold working interests to nonaffiliated
persons on the same basis. At December 31, 2000, affiliated persons were working
interest owners in 127 of the 164 wells then being operated by Patterson. In
some cases, the interests sold to affiliated and nonaffiliated participants were
sold on a promoted basis requiring these participants to pay a portion of
Patterson's costs. Patterson believes that each of the participations by the
affiliated persons has been on terms no less favorable to Patterson than it
could have obtained from nonaffiliated participants. It is expected that joint
participations with Patterson will occur from time to time in the future.
Conflicts of interest may arise between such directors and officers and
Patterson as to the advisability of conducting drilling and recompletion
activities on those properties. As is the case of sale of working interests by
Patterson in its properties to nonaffiliated persons, sales of working interests
to affiliated persons are made to reduce Patterson's economic risk in the
properties.

     The following table sets forth production revenues received and joint
production costs paid by each of the affiliated persons during 2000 for all
wells operated by Patterson in which they have working interests. These numbers
do not necessarily represent their profits or losses from these interests
because the joint production costs do not include the parties' related drilling
and leasehold acquisition costs incurred prior to January 1, 2000.

                                                               YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31,

(1) Revenues received for production of oil and natural gas, net of state
    severance taxes.

(2) Includes leasehold costs, tangible equipment costs, intangible drilling
    costs and lease operating expense billed during that period. All joint
    interest billings have been paid on a timely basis.

(3) Anita Talbott is the wife of Cloyce A. Talbott. Stan Talbott, Lisa Beck and
    Stacy Talbott are Mr. Talbott's adult children. Steve Talbott is the
    deceased son of Mr. Talbott.

(4) SSI Oil & Gas, Inc. is beneficially owned 50% by Cloyce A. Talbott and
    directly owned 50% by A. Glenn Patterson.

(5) IDC Enterprises, Ltd. is 50% owned by Cloyce A. Talbott and 50% owned by A.
    Glenn Patterson.

(6) SSSL, Ltd. is a limited partnership whereby Cloyce A. Talbott is the general
    partner.

(7) T & H Exploration is a company owned in part by Jana Talbott, Executrix to
    the Estate of Steve Talbott.

(8) Robert and Thomas M. Patterson are A. Glenn Patterson's adult children. The
    Glenn Patterson Family Limited Partnership is a partnership in which each of
    Mr. Patterson's children share in equally and Mr. Patterson is the manager.

     Any future transactions between Patterson and its officers, directors, key
employees, 5% stockholders and their family members and affiliates will continue
to be subject to the approval of a majority of disinterested members of the
board of directors and will continue to be on terms no less favorable to
Patterson than those that could be negotiated with nonaffiliated parties. During
February 1994, the Patterson board of directors adopted a blanket policy
approving in advance all joint participations with affiliated persons in oil and
gas prospects and properties after that date, provided that the participations
of such affiliated persons are on the same basis as participations with
nonaffiliated persons. In those instances when there are no nonaffiliated
third-party participants, prior approval of the board of directors is required
on a participation-by-participation basis.

PERFORMANCE GRAPH

     The following graph shows the changes over the past approximate five-year
period beginning December 31, 1995, and ending December 31, 2000, in the value
of $100 invested in: (1) Patterson Energy, Inc. common stock; (2) an MG Group
Index consisting of 57 companies engaged in oil and gas field services (all
within SIC Code 1381); (3) the NASDAQ Market Index; and (4) a Peer Group Index
consisting of five companies who are principally engaged in providing contract
drilling services to the oil and natural gas industry. The year-end values of
each investment are based on share price appreciation and assume that $100 was
invested on December 31, 1995, and that all dividends are reinvested.
Calculations exclude trading commissions and taxes. The comparison in the graph
is required by the SEC and, therefore, is not intended to forecast or be
indicative of possible future performance of Patterson's common stock.

COMPLIANCE WITH SECTION 16(a) OF THE EXCHANGE ACT

     Section 16(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "1934
Act"), requires Patterson's officers and directors, and persons who own more
than 10% of a registered class of Patterson's equity securities, to file reports
of ownership and changes in ownership with the SEC. Each of these persons is
required by SEC regulation to furnish Patterson with copies of Section 16(a)
filings. Based solely on its review of copies of such forms received by it and
written representations from certain reporting persons that no Forms 5 were
required for those persons, Patterson believes that, during the fiscal year
ended December 31, 2000, its officers, directors, and greater than 10%
beneficial owners other than Messrs. Nelson and Armour, complied with all
applicable filing requirements. On December 28, 2000, Mr. Nelson sold 7,500
shares of Patterson common stock and exercised options to purchase 20,000 shares
of Patterson common stock. During March 2000, Mr. Armour sold calls on 3,600
shares of Patterson. Neither Mr. Nelson nor Mr. Armour filed Forms 4 with
respect to these transactions, nor have they filed Forms 5 with respect thereto
in 2001.

                              FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

     The following unaudited pro forma combined financial statements are
presented to give effect to the merger between Patterson and UTI based on the
pooling-of-interests method of accounting at the exchange ratio of one share of
Patterson common stock for each share of UTI common stock. The unaudited pro
forma balance sheet data are presented as if the merger was effective on
December 31, 2000. The unaudited pro forma statements of operations data are
presented as if the merger was effective as of the beginning of the earliest
period presented. You should not rely on the pro forma amounts as being
indicative of the financial position or the results of operations of
Patterson-UTI, the combined company, that would have actually occurred had the
merger been effective during the periods presented or of the future financial
position or future results of operations of the combined company.

     The unaudited pro forma combined statements of operations exclude
non-recurring charges directly attributable to the merger, estimated at pretax
$10 million, substantially all of which will be charged to operations in the
quarter in which the merger is consummated. The unaudited pro forma combined
balance sheet has been adjusted to reflect the assumed after-tax impact of such
non-recurring charges. You should read the condensed unaudited pro forma
combined financial statements in conjunction with the historical consolidated
financial statements and accompanying notes of Patterson and UTI incorporated by
reference in this document.

                          NOTES TO UNAUDITED PRO FORMA
                         COMBINED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

1. UNAUDITED PRO FORMA FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

     The accompanying unaudited pro forma combined financial statements have
been prepared using the pooling-of-interests method of accounting to present the
merger between Patterson and UTI. The basis of the unaudited pro forma combined
balance sheet reflects the conversion of each outstanding share of UTI common
stock into one share of Patterson common stock (an exchange ratio of 1:1). The
unaudited pro forma combined statements of operations reflect the conversion of
the historical number of shares of UTI common stock outstanding used in
computing earnings per share into Patterson common stock using the exchange
ratio of 1:1. The actual number of shares to be issued in the merger will be
determined by the actual number of shares of UTI common stock outstanding at the
effective time of the merger. The merger agreement obligates Patterson to assume
UTI stock options outstanding under UTI stock option plans in effect on the date
of the merger agreement and also to assume UTI warrants outstanding at that
time. Common stock equivalents have been considered in the net income (loss) per
common share calculation for each of the three years ended December 31, 2000,
1999 and 1998.

2. PERIODS PRESENTED

     The unaudited pro forma combined financial statements were prepared using
the audited historical consolidated financial statements of both Patterson and
UTI. The unaudited pro forma combined balance sheet assumes the merger had been
consummated on December 31, 2000. The unaudited pro forma combined statement of
operations for each of the years in the three year period ended December 31,
2000 assumes that the merger had been consummated on January 1, 1998.

3. PRO FORMA ADJUSTMENTS

     The following adjustments were made to conform the accounting methods of
Patterson and UTI and to recognize the estimated costs associated with the
merger.

     a. To adjust for certain differences between the two companies' relative
methods of accounting for the recognition of revenue under turnkey drilling
contract arrangements. Patterson applies the completed contract method to
turnkey drilling contracts which requires revenue and costs associated with
drilling the well to be deferred until drilling is complete. UTI accounts for
its turnkey arrangements using the percentage-of-completion method in which
revenue is recognized as costs are incurred relative to the expected total cost
of drilling the well.

     b. To adjust for the difference in the par value per share for the common
stock issued upon consummation of the merger. Patterson's par value of common
stock is $0.01 per share and UTI's par value is $0.001 per share.

     c. To reflect the estimated direct costs associated with the merger between
Patterson and UTI which are estimated to be $10 million (approximately $6.5
million net of income tax). These non-recurring costs, which are subject to
change, will be charged to operations in the quarter in which the merger is
consummated.

     d. To adjust diluted shares outstanding using Patterson's year end market
price.

                       COMPARISON OF STOCKHOLDERS' RIGHTS

     As a result of the merger, the holders of UTI common stock will become
holders of Patterson common stock. The rights of the stockholders of Patterson
will be governed by applicable Delaware law, including the Delaware General
Corporation Law, or DGCL, and by Patterson's restated certificate of
incorporation and bylaws.

     The following is a summary of the material differences between the rights
of Patterson stockholders and UTI stockholders. Because both Patterson and UTI
are organized under the laws of the State of Delaware, these differences arise
principally from differences between the Patterson restated certificate of
incorporation and the UTI restated certificate of incorporation, and differences
between Patterson's bylaws and UTI's bylaws.

     The following summaries do not provide a complete description of the
specific rights of Patterson stockholders under its restated certificate of
incorporation and bylaws as compared with the rights of UTI stockholders under
its restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws. The identification of
specific differences in the rights of these holders as material is not intended
to indicate that other equally important or more significant differences do not
exist. These summaries are qualified in their entirety by reference to the
governing corporate instruments of Patterson and UTI to which you are referred.

AUTHORIZED CAPITAL STOCK

     The total number of authorized shares of capital stock of Patterson is
51,000,000, consisting of 50,000,000 shares of common stock, par value $0.01 per
share, and 1,000,000 shares of preferred stock, par value $0.01 per share. In
connection with the merger, holders of Patterson common stock will vote on a
proposal to amend Patterson's restated certificate of incorporation to increase
the number of authorized shares of common stock to 200,000,000 shares.

     The total number of authorized shares of capital stock of UTI is
105,000,000, consisting of 100,000,000 shares of common stock, par value $0.001
per share, and 5,000,000 shares of preferred stock, par value $0.01 per share.

DIRECTORS

     Patterson's Board will be increased to 11 members at the effective time of
the merger. Of the 11 members to be named to the initial Patterson-UTI board,
Patterson will designate six and UTI will designate five.

     Under Section 141(b) of the DGCL, the number of directors shall be fixed
by, or in the manner provided in, the bylaws unless otherwise provided in the
certificate of incorporation. A director need not be a stockholder to be
qualified to serve as a director unless required by the certificate of
incorporation or bylaws. Section 141(d) of the DGCL permits a classified board
of directors with staggered terms under which one-half to one-third of the
directors are elected for terms of two or three years, respectively.

     The Patterson restated certificate of incorporation does not fix the number
of directors. The Patterson bylaws provide that the number of directors may be
fixed, changed by amendment to the bylaws or set by resolution of Patterson's
board. The number of directors of Patterson is currently set at seven, with each
director serving until the next annual meeting following his election and until
his successor is elected and qualified, or until his earlier resignation,
removal or death. Directors may not be elected by written consent of the
stockholders.

     The Patterson bylaws provide that individuals may be nominated for election
to Patterson's board at a meeting of Patterson stockholders (a) by or at the
direction of the Patterson board or (b) by a stockholder entitled to vote for
the election of directors who complies with certain notice procedures set forth
in the Patterson bylaws. Under those procedures, the stockholder must deliver or
mail notice to the Secretary of Patterson at the principal executive offices of
Patterson not less than 30 days nor more than 60 days prior to the stockholders'
meeting. In the event that Patterson gives the stockholder less than

40 days' written notice of the meeting, the stockholder must deliver the notice
no later than the close of business on the 10th day following the day on which
the notice of the date of the meeting was mailed.

     The Patterson bylaws also require that the stockholder include certain
information in the notice. A stockholder's notice must include (i) as to each
person whom the stockholder proposes to nominate for election or re-election as
director, all information relating to such person that is required to be
disclosed in solicitations of proxies for election of directors by the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, (ii) the stockholder's name and
record address, and (iii) the class and number of shares of Patterson that the
stockholder beneficially owns.

     If the presiding officer at the meeting determines that the nomination does
not comply with these requirements, he may declare that the defective nomination
will be disregarded.

     The UTI restated certificate of incorporation does not fix the number of
directors. The UTI bylaws provide that UTI's board may fix or change by
resolution the number of directors, subject to the right of UTI's stockholders
to change such number at any annual meeting, or at a special meeting called for
that purpose. UTI currently has seven directors. The seven directors are divided
into three separate classes, consisting, as nearly as possible, of equal numbers
of directors, with one class being elected annually. Directors serve terms of
three years until their successors are elected and qualified.

     As with Patterson, only persons nominated according to specified procedures
are eligible to serve as directors. UTI's bylaws provide that nominations of
persons for election to the UTI board may be made at a UTI stockholders' meeting
only (a) by or at the direction of the UTI board or (b) by a UTI stockholder
entitled to vote for the election of directors. As with Patterson, the UTI
bylaws specify procedures for nominating directors. A stockholder's notice must
be delivered to or mailed and received by UTI's principal executive offices not
less than 90 days nor more than 120 days prior to the anniversary date of the
immediately preceding annual stockholders' meeting. In the event that the annual
meeting is called for a date that is not within 30 days before or after this
anniversary date, the notice must be received by UTI no later than the close of
business on the 10th day following the day notice of the meeting date was mailed
or made public, whichever occurs first.

     The information required in the notice is identical to that required by
Patterson, except that it must also include (i) a description of all
arrangements or understandings between the nominating stockholder and each
proposed nominee, (ii) a representation that such stockholder intends to appear
in person or by proxy at the meeting to nominate the nominee, and (iii) a
written consent of each nominee to being named as a nominee and to serve as a
director if elected.

     As with Patterson, the chairman at the meeting of UTI stockholders may
declare that the stockholder nomination did not comply with procedure and
disregard the defective nomination.

REMOVAL OF DIRECTORS

     Section 141(k) of the DGCL provides that directors may be removed, with or
without cause, by a majority of shareholders entitled to vote in the election of
that director, unless the board of directors is classified. In that case, unless
provided otherwise in the certificate of incorporation, a director may be
removed only for cause.

     Under the Patterson bylaws, the holders of a majority of the shares may
remove with or without cause any one or more directors or the entire board.
UTI's restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws provide that neither
directors nor the entire board can be removed from office except for cause.

QUORUM AT MEETING OF DIRECTORS

     Section 141(b) of the DGCL provides that a quorum at a board of directors
meeting shall be not less than one-third of the directors.

     Patterson's bylaws define a quorum for the transaction of business at any
meeting as a majority of the whole authorized number of directors, except that a
majority of the directors then in office shall constitute a quorum for filling a
vacancy on the board.

     UTI's bylaws provide that a majority of the directors at that time in
office shall constitute a quorum for the transaction of business at any meeting.

SPECIAL STOCKHOLDER MEETINGS

     Under Section 211(d) of the DGCL, special meetings of stockholders may be
called by the board of directors or by such other persons authorized to do so by
the corporation's certificate of incorporation or bylaws.

     The Patterson restated certificate of incorporation provides that special
meetings of stockholders may be called by the majority of the board of
directors, the Chief Executive Officer, the President, or the holders of a
majority of the outstanding common stock of Patterson. The UTI bylaws provide
that only the majority of the board of directors, the Chairman of the Board, or
the President may call a special meeting of stockholders.

NOTICE OF MEETING OF THE STOCKHOLDERS

     Section 222(a) of the DGCL provides that stockholders will receive written
notice of any meeting where they are required or permitted to take any action.

     Patterson's bylaws require that Patterson provide notice of stockholder
meetings by personal delivery or by mail. Under its bylaws, UTI may deliver
notice of stockholder meetings by personal delivery, mail, telegraph or cable.

STOCKHOLDER ACTION WITHOUT A MEETING

     Under Section 228 of the DGCL, unless otherwise provided in the certificate
of incorporation, stockholders may take any action without a meeting if a
written consent is signed by the holders of outstanding stock having not less
than the minimum number of votes that would be required to authorize or take
such action at a meeting if all shares were present and voted.

     The Patterson restated certificate of incorporation prohibits taking
stockholder actions without a meeting. UTI's bylaws provide that any action that
may be taken at a stockholders' meeting may be taken through the written consent
if signed by the holders of all of the outstanding UTI common stock.

STOCKHOLDER PROPOSALS

     The Patterson bylaws provide that a stockholder may propose business to be
brought before a stockholders' meeting if certain requirements are satisfied.
Patterson must receive notice of the proposed business at its principal
executive offices not less than 30 days nor more than 60 days prior to the
meeting as originally scheduled. In the event that less than 40 days' notice of
a meeting is given, the notice must be received not later than the close of
business on the 10th day following the day on which the notice of the meeting
was mailed.

     Patterson bylaws also require that the notice of proposed business contain
certain information. A stockholder's notice must set forth (i) a brief
description of each matter desired to be brought before the annual meeting, (ii)
the name and record address of the stockholder proposing such business, (iii)
the class and number of shares beneficially owned by the stockholder, and (iv)
any material interest the stockholder may have in the proposed business.

     If the facts warrant, the presiding officer at the meeting may determine
that the stockholder's proposal did not comply with the required procedures and
declare that the business not be transacted.

     UTI stockholders may also propose business to be brought before a
stockholders' meeting. To be timely, a UTI stockholder's notice must be received
at UTI's principal executive offices not less than 90 days nor more than 120
days prior to the anniversary date of the immediately preceding annual
stockholders' meeting. In the event the annual meeting is called for a date that
is not within 30 days before or after such anniversary date, UTI must receive
the notice no later than the close of business on the 10th day following the
earlier of the day on which notice of the meeting date was mailed or the day it
was publicly announced.

     The information required in the notice to UTI is identical to that required
by Patterson, except that it must also include (i) the reasons for conducting
such business at the annual meeting, and (ii) a representation that the
stockholder intends to appear in person or by proxy at the annual meeting to
bring the proposed business before the meeting.

     As with Patterson, the chairman of the meeting may determine that business
was not properly brought and declare that it shall not be transacted.

AMENDMENT TO CERTIFICATE OF INCORPORATION

     Under Section 242 of the DGCL, an amendment to the certificate of
incorporation requires the approval of the corporation's board and the
affirmative vote of a majority of the outstanding shares entitled to vote. In
addition, amendments that make changes relating to the capital stock by
increasing or decreasing the par value or the aggregate number of authorized
shares of a class, or otherwise adversely affecting the rights of such class,
must be approved by the majority vote of each class or series of stock affected,
even if such stock would not otherwise have such voting rights.

     The Patterson restated certificate of incorporation expressly authorizes
the Patterson board to adopt, amend or repeal any provisions in its restated
certificate of incorporation in a manner then allowed by law. The UTI restated
certificate of incorporation also expressly authorizes its board to adopt, amend
or repeal any provisions in its certificate of incorporation in a manner then
allowed by law. However, UTI's restated certificate of incorporation conditions
amending the provision establishing its classified board of directors upon the
approval by the holders of 66 2/3% of the shares of outstanding common stock
entitled to vote thereon.

RIGHTS PLAN

     Patterson and UTI have each adopted a stockholder rights plan. The rights
granted under the Patterson and UTI rights agreements have similar anti-takeover
effects, each causing substantial dilution to a person or group that attempts to
acquire, or merge with, either company without conditioning the offer on the
rights being rendered inapplicable.

     In January 1997, the board of directors of Patterson adopted a stockholder
rights plan under which stockholders of record as of January 17, 1997 received a
dividend in the form of preferred share purchase rights (the "Patterson
Rights"). The Patterson Rights permit the holder to purchase one one-hundredth
of a share (a unit) of Series A preferred stock at an initial exercise price of
$41.50 per share under certain circumstances. The purchase price, the number of
units of preferred stock and the type of securities issuable upon exercise of
the Patterson Rights are subject to adjustment. The Patterson board of directors
is authorized to approve the issuance of one or more series of preferred stock
without further authorization of the stockholders and to fix the number of
shares, the designations, rights, privileges, restrictions and conditions of any
such series.

     The Patterson Rights expire on January 2, 2007 unless earlier redeemed or
exchanged. Until a Patterson Right is exercised, the holder thereof has no
rights as a stockholder of Patterson. The Patterson Rights become exercisable on
the earlier to occur of (i) the acquisition by a person or group of persons of
15% or more of the outstanding shares of Patterson common stock, or (ii) 10 days
following the commencement of, or the public announcement of an intention to
make, a tender offer or exchange offer

that would result in a person or group beneficially owning 15% or more of the
outstanding shares of Patterson common stock.

     In February 1999, the UTI board of directors adopted a stockholder rights
plan through the declaration of a dividend of one preferred stock purchase right
(a "UTI Right") for each outstanding share of UTI common stock, and authorized
the issuance of one UTI Right for each share of UTI common stock that later
becomes outstanding prior to the distribution date (as hereinafter defined), the
date of redemption of the UTI Rights or the final expiration date of the UTI
Rights. The UTI Rights permit the holder to purchase one two-thousandth of a
share (a unit) of Series I preferred stock at an initial exercise price of
$21.25 per share under certain circumstances. The purchase price and the number
of shares of Series I preferred stock issuable upon exercise of the UTI Rights
are subject to adjustment. The holder of Series I preferred stock will be
entitled to a minimum preferential quarterly dividend payment of $1 per share
but will be entitled to an aggregate dividend of 1,000 times the dividend
declared per share of UTI common stock. In the event UTI liquidates, the holders
of the interests in Series I preferred stock will be entitled to a minimum
preferential liquidation payment of $100 per share but will be entitled to an
aggregate payment of 1,000 times the payment made per share of UTI common stock.
Each share of Series I preferred stock will have 1,000 votes, voting together
with the shares of UTI common stock. In the event UTI merges, consolidates or
effects another transaction in which shares of UTI common stock are exchanged,
each share of Series I preferred stock will be entitled to receive 1,000 times
the amount received per share of UTI common stock.

     The UTI Rights expire on February 26, 2009 unless the expiration date is
extended or unless UTI earlier redeems or exchanges the UTI Rights. Until a UTI
Right is exercised, the holder thereof has no rights as a stockholder of UTI.
The UTI Rights become exercisable on the distribution date, defined as the
earlier to occur of (i) ten (10) business days following a public announcement
that a person or group of persons have acquired 15% or more of the outstanding
shares of UTI common stock, or (ii) ten (10) business days following the
commencement of, or the public announcement of an intention to make, a tender
offer or exchange offer that would result in a person or group beneficially
owning 15% or more of the outstanding shares of UTI common stock.

     On February 9, 2001, UTI and Mellon Investor Services LLC, rights agent,
amended the UTI stockholder rights plan to provide that Patterson would not be
deemed to be an acquiring person for purposes of the rights plan. The amendment
also provided that no distribution date would occur, the provisions of Section
13 of the rights plan would not take effect and the UTI Rights would not be
exercisable as a result of the execution and delivery of the merger agreement or
the consummation of the merger.

                       PROPOSED AMENDMENTS TO PATTERSON'S
                     RESTATED CERTIFICATE OF INCORPORATION

ADDITIONAL AUTHORIZED COMMON STOCK PROPOSAL

     Patterson's board of directors has approved a proposal authorizing an
amendment to Patterson's restated certificate of incorporation to increase the
authorized shares of Patterson's common stock from 50,000,000 to 200,000,000.

     This proposed amendment, if approved by the Patterson stockholders at the
Patterson special meeting, would take effect only if the merger proposal is also
adopted by the Patterson stockholders at the special meeting. The form of
certificate of amendment to effect this increase is attached to this joint proxy
statement/prospectus as Annex D.

     Patterson does not have a sufficient number of authorized, but unissued,
shares of common stock to effect the merger. Therefore, approval of this
proposed amendment is a prerequisite to approval of the proposal for the merger.

     The following table sets forth the number of issued, outstanding, and
reserved shares of Patterson common stock on March 13, 2001, the record date for
the Patterson special meeting, and the number of shares of Patterson common
stock that will be issued, outstanding, and reserved if the amendment is
approved and the merger is consummated:

                                                                  NUMBER OF SHARES
                                                              ------------------------
                                                                BEFORE        AFTER
                                                                MERGER       MERGER
                                                              ----------   -----------

Authorized..................................................  50,000,000   200,000,000
Issued and outstanding......................................
Reserved:
  Patterson stock options...................................
  UTI stock options and warrants (substituted options and
     warrants)..............................................
Unissued and unreserved.....................................

     The unissued and unreserved Patterson common shares would be available for
issuance from time to time as may be necessary in connection with:

     - future financings,

     - acquisitions,

     - transactions,

     - stock dividends,

     - stock splits,

     - distributions,

     - stock option plans,

     - other employee benefit plans, and

     - other corporate purposes.

     Patterson currently has no plans to issue any of these unissued and
unreserved shares.

     The additional authorized shares of Patterson common stock would have the
same rights and privileges as the shares of Patterson common stock currently
outstanding. Holders of shares of Patterson

common stock have no preemptive rights to subscribe for any additional shares of
Patterson common stock.

     Under Delaware law, the Patterson board of directors generally may issue
authorized but unissued shares of common stock without stockholder approval. The
board does not intend to seek stockholder approval prior to any future issuance
of the shares, except to the extent otherwise required by Patterson's restated
certificate of incorporation, by law or by the Nasdaq National Market or any
securities exchange on which the Patterson common stock may be listed at that
time.

     The authorization of additional shares of Patterson common stock will
enable Patterson, as the need may arise, to take timely advantage of market
conditions and of favorable opportunities without the delay and expense
associated with the holding of a special meeting of its stockholders or of
waiting for the regularly scheduled annual stockholders meeting in order to
increase the authorized shares of Patterson common stock. Patterson stockholders
will have no preemptive rights to purchase shares of Patterson common stock
issued in the merger or in the future.

     The increase in the authorized but unissued shares of Patterson's common
stock pursuant to the amendment could, under certain circumstances, have the
effect of deterring attempts to acquire control of Patterson. However, Patterson
believes that the increase in the number of authorized shares of common stock is
important to meet the future needs of Patterson. The proposed amendment is not
being presented as, nor is it part of, a plan to adopt a series of anti-takeover
measures. Patterson is unaware of any pending or proposed takeover attempt.

     Approval of this proposed amendment requires the affirmative vote of the
holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of Patterson's common stock. FOR
THE REASONS STATED ABOVE, THE PATTERSON BOARD OF DIRECTORS RECOMMENDS THAT
PATTERSON STOCKHOLDERS VOTE "FOR" THIS AMENDMENT.

NAME CHANGE PROPOSAL

     Patterson's board of directors has also approved a proposal to amend
Patterson's restated certificate of incorporation to change Patterson's
corporate name from Patterson Energy, Inc. to "Patterson-UTI Energy, Inc." This
proposed amendment, if approved by the Patterson stockholders at the Patterson
special meeting, would take effect only if the merger is consummated. Approval
of the name change amendment is not a prerequisite to approval of the merger.
The certificate of amendment to effect the name change is attached to this joint
proxy statement/prospectus as Annex E.

     Approval of this proposed amendment requires the affirmative vote of the
holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of Patterson's common stock. THE
PATTERSON BOARD OF DIRECTORS RECOMMENDS THAT PATTERSON STOCKHOLDERS VOTE "FOR"
THIS AMENDMENT.

                                 LEGAL MATTERS

     The validity of the shares of Patterson common stock to be issued in the
merger will be passed on for Patterson by Baker & Hostetler LLP, counsel to
Patterson. Certain tax consequences of the merger will be passed on for
Patterson by Baker & Hostetler LLP, and for UTI by Fulbright & Jaworski L.L.P.

                                    EXPERTS

                             STOCKHOLDER PROPOSALS

     Any Patterson stockholder, or if the merger is consummated, any
Patterson-UTI stockholder, who intends to present a proposal at Patterson's or
Patterson-UTI's, as the case may be, 2002 annual meeting of stockholders for
inclusion in the proxy statement and form of proxy relating to that meeting is
advised that the proposal must be received by Patterson or Patterson-UTI, as the
case may be, at its principal executive offices not later than December 31,
2001. Patterson or Patterson-UTI, as the case may be, will not be required to
include in its proxy statement a form of proxy or stockholder proposal that is
received after that date or that otherwise fails to meet the requirements for
stockholder proposals established by regulations of the SEC.

     In addition, any Patterson or Patterson-UTI stockholder, as the case may
be, desiring to raise a matter, including nominating an individual for election
as a director, at Patterson's or Patterson-UTI's, as the case may be, 2002
annual meeting of stockholders, where the stockholder has not sought inclusion
of the matter in its proxy statement and proxy relating to such meeting, must
comply with the advance notification provisions in Patterson's bylaws. Pursuant
to this advance notice provision, a stockholder's notice must be delivered to or
mailed and received at Patterson's or Patterson-UTI's, as the case may be,
principal executive offices not less than 30 days nor more than 60 days prior to
the meeting. However, in the event that less than 40 days' prior public
disclosure of the date of the meeting is made to stockholders, a notice by the
stockholder will be timely if it is received not later than the close of
business on the tenth day following the day on which the public disclosure was
made or notice of the date of the meeting was mailed, whichever first occurs.

     In the event that the merger is not consummated, any UTI stockholder who
intends to present a proposal at UTI's 2002 annual meeting of stockholders for
inclusion in the proxy statement and form of proxy relating to that meeting is
advised that the written proposal and any written statement in support of the
proposal must be received by the Secretary of UTI at the principal executive
offices not later than January 31, 2002. UTI will not be required to include in
its proxy statement a form of proxy or stockholder proposal that is received
after that date or that otherwise fails to meet the requirements for stockholder
proposals established by regulations of the SEC. If the merger is consummated as
currently contemplated, there will not be a 2002 annual meeting of UTI
stockholders.

     In addition, any UTI stockholder desiring to raise a matter, including
nominating an individual for election as a director, at UTI's 2002 annual
meeting of stockholders, where the stockholder has not sought inclusion of the
matter in its proxy statement and proxy relating to such meeting, must comply
with the advance notification provisions in UTI's bylaws. Such provisions
require that notice of stockholder matters be raised at an annual stockholders
meeting and be received by UTI's Secretary not later than the tenth day
following the date on which notice of the date of an annual meeting of
stockholders for 2002 is mailed or public disclosure of the date of the meeting
of stockholders is made, whichever first occurs. A stockholder who desires to
raise such matters should contact UTI's Secretary for the specific requirements
prescribed by the bylaws.

                          AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER

     AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER, dated as of February 4, 2001 (this
"Agreement"), between PATTERSON ENERGY, INC., a Delaware corporation ("PEC"),
and UTI ENERGY CORP., a Delaware corporation ("UTI") (PEC and UTI being
hereinafter collectively referred to as the "Constituent Corporations").

                                  WITNESSETH:

     WHEREAS, the respective Boards of Directors of PEC and UTI have approved
and declared fair to and advisable and in the best interests of their respective
stockholders the merger of PEC and UTI (the "Merger"), upon the terms and
subject to the conditions set forth herein, whereby the issued and outstanding
shares of Common Stock, par value $0.001 per share, of UTI ("UTI Common Stock")
not owned directly by UTI, will be converted into shares of Common Stock, par
value $.01 per share, of PEC ("PEC Common Stock" or "Surviving Corporation
Common Stock");

     WHEREAS, for federal income tax purposes, it is intended that the Merger
shall qualify as a reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the
Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code");

     WHEREAS, it is intended that the Merger shall be recorded for accounting
purposes as a pooling of interests, but such accounting treatment is not a
condition to the Merger; and

     WHEREAS, PEC and UTI desire to make certain representations, warranties and
agreements in connection with the Merger and also to prescribe various
conditions to the Merger.

     NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and the representations,
warranties and agreements herein contained, the parties agree as follows:

                                   ARTICLE I

     SECTION 1.1  The Merger.  Upon the terms and subject to the conditions
hereof, and in accordance with the General Corporation Law of the State of
Delaware (the "DGCL"), UTI shall be merged with and into PEC at the Effective
Time (as hereinafter defined). Following the Merger, the separate corporate
existence of UTI shall cease and PEC shall continue as the surviving corporation
(the "Surviving Corporation") and shall succeed to and assume all the rights and
obligations of UTI in accordance with the DGCL.

     SECTION 1.2  Effective Time.  The Merger shall become effective when the
Certificate of Merger (the "Certificate of Merger"), executed in accordance with
the relevant provisions of the DGCL, is filed with the Secretary of State of the
State of Delaware, provided, however, that, upon mutual consent of the
Constituent Corporations, the Certificate of Merger may provide for a later date
of effectiveness of the Merger not more than 30 days after the date the
Certificate of Merger is filed. When used in this Agreement, the term "Effective
Time" shall mean the later of the date and time at which the Certificate of
Merger is accepted for record or such later time established by the Certificate
of Merger. The filing of the Certificate of Merger shall be made as soon as
practicable after the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions to the Merger set
forth herein.

     SECTION 1.3  Effects of the Merger.  The Merger shall have the effects set
forth in Section 259 of the DGCL.

     SECTION 1.4  Certificate of Incorporation.  The Certificate of
Incorporation, as amended, of PEC, as in effect immediately prior to the
Effective Time, shall be the Certificate of Incorporation of the Surviving
Corporation until thereafter changed or amended as provided therein or by
applicable law, except that Article First shall be amended to change the name of
the Surviving Corporation to Patterson-UTI

Energy, Inc. and Article Fourth shall be amended to increase the number of
authorized shares of PEC common Stock from 50,000,000 shares to 150,000,000
shares, with the first sentence of Article Fourth amended to read in its
entirety as follows:

             "The total number of shares of stock that the Corporation
        shall have authority to issue is one hundred and fifty-one
        million (151,000,000) shares, of which one hundred and fifty
        million (150,000,000) shares shall be Common Stock, having a par
        value of $0.01 per share, and one million (1,000,000) shares
        shall be Preferred Stock, having a par value of $0.01 per
        share."

     SECTION 1.5  Bylaws.  The Bylaws of PEC, as in effect immediately prior to
the Effective Time, shall be the Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation until
thereafter changed or amended as provided therein by applicable law.

     SECTION 1.6  Directors.  At the Effective Time, the number of directors
comprising the full Board of Directors of the Surviving Corporation shall be
increased to eleven members, with six members to be designated by the PEC Board
of Directors and five members to be designated by the UTI Board of Directors,
with such eleven members to be the directors of the Surviving Corporation until
their respective successors have been duly elected or appointed in accordance
with the Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation or
by applicable law.

     SECTION 1.7  Conversion of Shares.  As of the Effective Time, by virtue of
the Merger and without any action on the part of any stockholder of UTI:

          (a) All shares of UTI Common Stock that are held in the treasury of
     UTI shall be canceled and no capital stock of PEC or other consideration
     shall be delivered in exchange therefor.

          (b) Subject to the provisions of Sections 1.10 and 1.12 hereof, each
     share of UTI Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
     Effective Time (other than shares to be canceled in accordance with Section
     1.7(a)) shall be converted into 1.0 share (the "Exchange Ratio") of validly
     issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of Common Stock, par value $0.01
     per share, of Surviving Corporation Common Stock. Pursuant to the Rights
     Agreement between PEC and Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company, as
     Rights Agent, dated January 2, 1997 ("PEC Rights Agreement"), each share of
     Surviving Corporation Common Stock shall be accompanied by a right under
     the Surviving Corporation Rights Agreement. All such shares of UTI Common
     Stock, when so converted, shall no longer be outstanding and shall
     automatically be canceled and retired and each holder of a Certificate (as
     defined in Section 1.8(a)) representing any such shares shall cease to have
     any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive certain
     dividends and other distributions as contemplated by Section 1.9 and shares
     of Surviving Corporation Common Stock and any cash, without interest, in
     lieu of fractional shares to be issued or paid in consideration therefor
     upon the surrender of such Certificate in accordance with Section 1.8.

          (c) Each then outstanding share of Surviving Corporation Common Stock
     shall continue to be an issued and outstanding share of Surviving
     Corporation Common Stock, and any share of Surviving Corporation Common
     Stock held in PEC's treasury immediately prior to the Effective Time and
     not issued in the Merger shall continue to be held in the treasury of PEC
     at the Effective Time.

     SECTION 1.8  Surviving Corporation to Make Certificates Available.

     (a) Exchange of Certificates.  PEC and UTI shall authorize Continental
Stock Transfer & Trust Company, New York, New York (or such other person or
persons as shall be reasonably acceptable to PEC and UTI) to act as Exchange
Agent hereunder (the "Exchange Agent"). As soon as practicable after the
Effective Time, Surviving Corporation shall deposit with the Exchange Agent for
the benefit of the holders of certificates, which immediately prior to the
Effective Time represented shares of UTI Common Stock (the "Certificates"),
certificates representing the shares of Surviving Corporation Common Stock (such
shares of Surviving Corporation Common Stock, together with any dividends or
distributions

exchange for outstanding shares of UTI Common Stock and associated rights.

     (b) Exchange Procedures.  Promptly after the Effective Time, the Exchange

contain instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates in
exchange for certificates representing shares of Surviving Corporation Common
Stock and shall be in such form and contain such other provisions as PEC and UTI
may reasonably specify). Upon surrender of a Certificate for cancellation to the
Exchange Agent, together with such letter of transmittal, duly executed, the
holder of such Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor a
certificate representing that number of whole shares of Surviving Corporation
Common Stock which such holder has the right to receive pursuant to this Article
I, and the Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be canceled. Until
surrendered as contemplated by this Section 1.8, each Certificate shall, at and
after the Effective Time, be deemed to represent only the right to receive, upon
surrender of such Certificate, the certificate representing the appropriate
number of shares of Surviving Corporation Common Stock, cash in lieu of
fractional shares, if any, as provided in Section 1.10 and certain dividends and
other distributions as contemplated by Section 1.9.

     SECTION 1.9  Dividends; Transfer Taxes.  No dividends or other
distributions that may be declared on or after the Effective Time on Surviving
Corporation Common Stock or are payable to the holders of record thereof on or
after the Effective Time will be paid to persons entitled by reason of the
Merger to receive certificates representing Surviving Corporation Common Stock
until such persons surrender their Certificates, as provided in Section 1.8, and
no cash payment in lieu of fractional shares shall be paid to any such holder
pursuant to Section 1.10 until such holder of such Certificate shall so
surrender such Certificate. Subject to the effect of applicable law, there shall
be paid to the record holder of the certificates representing such Surviving
Corporation Common Stock (i) at the time of such surrender or as promptly as
practicable thereafter, the amount of any dividends or other distributions
theretofore paid with respect to whole shares of such Surviving Corporation
Common Stock and having a record date on or after the Effective Time and a
payment date prior to such surrender and (ii) at the appropriate payment date or
as promptly as practicable thereafter, the amount of dividends or other
distributions payable with respect to whole shares of Surviving Corporation
Common Stock and having a record date on or after the Effective Time but prior
to surrender and a payment date subsequent to surrender. In no event shall the
person entitled to receive such dividends or other distributions be entitled to
receive interest on such dividends or other distributions. If any cash or
certificate representing shares of Surviving Corporation Common Stock is to be
paid to or issued in a name other than that in which the Certificate surrendered
in exchange therefor is registered, it shall be a condition of such exchange
that the Certificate so surrendered shall be properly endorsed and otherwise in
proper form for transfer and that the person requesting such exchange shall pay
to the Exchange Agent any transfer or other taxes required by reason of the
issuance of certificates for such shares of Surviving Corporation Common Stock
in a name other than that of the registered holder of the Certificate
surrendered, or shall establish to the satisfaction of the Exchange Agent that
such tax has been paid or is not applicable.

     SECTION 1.10  No Fractional Shares.  No certificates or scrip representing
fractional shares of Surviving Corporation Common Stock shall be issued upon the
surrender for exchange of Certificates pursuant to this Article I, and no PEC
dividend or other distribution or stock split or combination shall relate to any
fractional security, and such fractional interests shall not entitle the owner
thereof to vote or to any rights of a security holder of PEC. In lieu of any
such fractional securities, each holder of shares of UTI Common Stock who would
otherwise have been entitled to receive a fraction of a share of Surviving
Corporation Common Stock (after taking into account all shares of UTI Common
Stock then held of record by such holder) shall receive cash (without interest)
in an amount equal to the product of such fractional part of a share of UTI
Common Stock multiplied by the Closing Price. As used in this
                                       A-3

Agreement, (i) "Closing Price" means the average of the midpoint of the daily
high and low trading prices of Surviving Corporation Common Stock, rounded to
four decimal places, as reported under Nasdaq National Market Issues Reports in
The Wall Street Journal for each of the first 20 consecutive Trading Days in the
period commencing twenty-five (25) Trading Days prior to the date of the Closing
and (ii) "Trading Day" means a day on which the National Association of
Securities Dealers, Inc. National Market ("Nasdaq National Market") is open for
trading.

     SECTION 1.11  Return of Exchange Fund.  Any portion of the Exchange Fund
which remains undistributed to the former stockholders of UTI for one year after
the Effective Time shall be delivered to Surviving Corporation, upon demand of
Surviving Corporation, and any former stockholders of UTI who have not
theretofore complied with this Article I shall thereafter look only to Surviving
Corporation for payment of their claim for Surviving Corporation Common Stock,
any cash in lieu of fractional shares of Surviving Corporation Common Stock and
any dividends or distributions with respect to Surviving Corporation Common
Stock. None of PEC, UTI nor the Surviving Corporation shall be liable to any
holder of shares of UTI Common Stock for shares (or dividends or distributions
with respect thereto) or cash in lieu of fractional shares of Surviving
Corporation Common Stock delivered to a public official pursuant to any
applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar law.

     SECTION 1.12  Adjustment of Exchange Ratio.  In the event of any
reclassification, recapitalization, stock split, stock combination, stock
dividend or share exchange with respect to PEC Common Stock or UTI Common Stock,
as the case may be, (or if a record date with respect to any of the foregoing
should occur) prior to the Effective Time, appropriate and proportionate
adjustments, if any, shall be made to the Exchange Ratio, and all references to
the Exchange Ratio in this Agreement shall be deemed to be to the Exchange Ratio
as so adjusted.

     SECTION 1.13  No Further Ownership Rights in UTI Common Stock.  All shares
of Surviving Corporation Common Stock issued upon the surrender for exchange of
Certificates in accordance with the terms hereof (including any cash paid
pursuant to Sections 1.9 or 1.10) shall be deemed to have been issued in full
satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the shares of UTI Common Stock,
subject, however, to the Surviving Corporation's obligation to pay any dividends
or make any other distribution with a record date prior to the Effective Time
which may have been declared or made by UTI on such shares of UTI Common Stock
in accordance with the terms of this Agreement.

     SECTION 1.14  Closing of UTI Transfer Books.  At the Effective Time, the
stock transfer books of UTI shall be closed and no transfer of shares of UTI
Common Stock shall thereafter be made. If, after the Effective Time,
Certificates are presented to the Surviving Corporation, they shall be canceled
and exchanged as provided in this Article I.

     SECTION 1.15  Further Assurances.  If at any time after the Effective Time
the Surviving Corporation shall consider or be advised that any deeds, bills of
sale, assignments or assurances or any other acts or things are necessary,
desirable or proper (a) to vest, perfect or confirm, of record or otherwise, in
the Surviving Corporation, its right, title or interest in, to or under any of
the rights, privileges, powers, franchises, properties or assets of either of
the Constituent Corporations, or (b) otherwise to carry out the purposes of this
Agreement, the Surviving Corporation and its proper officers and directors or
their designees shall be authorized to execute and deliver, in the name and on
behalf of either of the Constituent Corporations in the Merger, all such deeds,
bills of sale, assignments and assurances and do, in the name and on behalf of
such Constituent Corporations, all such other acts and things necessary,
desirable or proper to vest, perfect or confirm its right, title or interest in,
to or under any of the rights, privileges, powers, franchises, properties or
assets of such Constituent Corporation and otherwise to carry out the purposes
of this Agreement.

     SECTION 1.16  Closing.  The closing of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement (the "Closing") shall take place at the offices of Baker &
Hostetler LLP, 1000 Louisiana, Suite 2000, Houston, Texas 77002-5009, at 10:00
a.m. local time, on the second business day after the day on which the last of
the conditions set forth in Article VI hereof shall have been fulfilled or
waived or at such other time and place as PEC and UTI shall agree.

                                   ARTICLE II

                     REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF PEC

     PEC represents and warrants to UTI as follows:

     SECTION 2.1  Organization, Standing and Power.  PEC is a corporation duly
incorporated, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the
jurisdiction of its incorporation and has the requisite corporate power and
authority to own, lease and operate its properties and to carry on its business
as now being conducted. Each Subsidiary of PEC is a limited liability company or
a limited liability limited partnership duly organized validly existing and in
good standing under the laws of the jurisdiction of its organization and has the
requisite limited liability company or limited partnership power and authority,
as the case may be, to own and operate its properties and to carry on its
business as now being conducted. PEC and each of its Subsidiaries is duly
qualified to do business, and is in good standing, in each jurisdiction where
the character of its properties owned or held under lease or the nature of its
activities makes such qualification necessary, except where the failure to be so
qualified would not, individually or in the aggregate, have a Material Adverse
Effect on PEC. For purposes of this Agreement (a) "Material Adverse Change" or
"Material Adverse Effect" means, when used with respect to PEC or UTI, as the
case may be, any change or effect that is or, so far as can reasonably be
determined, is likely to be materially adverse to the assets, properties,
condition (financial or otherwise), business or results of operations of PEC and
its Subsidiaries taken as a whole or UTI and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole,
as the case may be, and (b) "Subsidiary" means any corporation, partnership,
joint venture, limited liability company or other legal entity of which PEC or
UTI, as the case may be (either alone or through or together with any other
Subsidiary), owns, directly or indirectly, 50% or more of the stock or other
equity interests the holders of which are generally entitled to vote for the
election of the board of directors or other governing body of such corporation
or other legal entity. Section 2.1 of the disclosure statement of PEC dated as
of the date hereof previously furnished to UTI (the "PEC Disclosure Schedule")
contains a list of PEC's Subsidiaries.

     SECTION 2.2  Capital Structure.  As of the date hereof, the authorized
capital stock of PEC consists of 50,000,000 shares of PEC Common Stock and
1,000,000 shares of Preferred Stock, par value $0.01 per share ("PEC Preferred
Stock"). Except as set forth in Section 2.2 of the PEC Disclosure Schedule, all
of the outstanding equity securities of each Subsidiary of PEC is owned by PEC
directly or indirectly, free and clear of any Lien (as defined in Section 2.10),
including any restriction on the right to vote, sell or otherwise dispose of
such equity securities. At the close of business on February 2, 2001, (i)
38,014,326 shares of PEC Common Stock were validly issued and outstanding, fully
paid and nonassessable and free of preemptive rights, (ii) 1,792,520 shares of
PEC Common Stock were reserved for issuance upon the exercise of options for PEC
Common Stock then outstanding under the PEC 1993 Stock Incentive Plan and
Non-Employee Directors' Stock Option Plan (collectively, the "PEC Stock Plans"),
(iii) 30,900 additional shares of PEC Common Stock were reserved for issuance
under the PEC Stock Plans, (iv) 127,000 shares of PEC Common Stock were reserved
for issuance upon the exercise of warrants granted as partial consideration for
certain acquired drilling assets (the "PEC Warrants") (v) 300,000 shares of PEC
Common Stock were held by PEC in its treasury, and (vi) no shares of PEC
Preferred Stock were issued and outstanding or reserved for issuance. There are
no outstanding stock appreciation rights ("SARs"). PEC Common Stock is
designated as a national market security on an interdealer quotation system by
the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. All of the shares of
Surviving Corporation Common Stock issuable in exchange for UTI Common Stock at
the Effective Time in accordance with this Agreement and issuable upon exercise
of Substituted Options (as defined in Section 5.7) or Substituted Warrants (as
defined in Section 5.8) will be, when so issued, duly authorized, validly
issued, fully paid and nonassessable and free of preemptive rights. Except for
options granted pursuant to the PEC Stock Plans, the PEC Warrants and the Rights
issued pursuant to the PEC Rights Agreement, there are no options, warrants,
rights, commitments, agreements, arrangements or undertakings of any kind to
which PEC or any of its Subsidiaries is a party or by which any of them is bound
obligating PEC or any of its Subsidiaries to issue, deliver or sell, or cause to
be issued, delivered or sold, additional equity securities or other voting
securities of PEC or of any of its Subsidiaries. True and correct copies of
                                       A-5

all agreements, instruments and other governing documents relating to the PEC
Stock Plans and the PEC Rights Agreement have been furnished to UTI.

     SECTION 2.3  Authority; Non-Contravention.  The Board of Directors of PEC
has declared the Merger and an amendment to PEC's Certificate of Incorporation
to increase the number of authorized shares of PEC Common Stock to 150,000,000
shares (the "Charter Amendment") fair to and advisable and in the best interests
of the stockholders of PEC. PEC has all requisite power and authority to enter
into this Agreement and, subject to the approval of the Merger and the Charter
Amendment by the stockholders of PEC, to consummate the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated hereby. The execution and delivery by PEC of this
Agreement and any Stock Option Assumption Agreements (as defined in Section 5.7)
or Warrant Assumption Agreements (as defined in Section 5.8) and the
consummation by PEC of the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby have
been duly authorized by all necessary corporate action on the part of PEC,
subject to such approval of the Merger and the Charter Amendment by the
stockholders of PEC. This Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by PEC
and (assuming the valid authorization, execution and delivery of this Agreement
by UTI) constitutes a valid and binding obligation of PEC enforceable against
PEC in accordance with its terms, except to the extent enforceability may be
limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium, fraudulent
transfer or other similar laws of general applicability relating to or affecting
the enforcement of creditors' rights and by the effect of general principles of
equity (regardless of whether enforceability is considered in a proceeding in
equity or at law). The Merger, the Charter Amendment and the filing of a
registration statement with the SEC by PEC on Form S-4 under the Securities Act
of 1933, as amended (together with the rules and regulations promulgated
thereunder, the "Securities Act"), for the purpose of registering the shares of
PEC Common Stock to be issued in the Merger (together with any amendments or
supplements thereto, the "S-4 Registration Statement"), and the filing of a
registration statement with the SEC by PEC on Form S-8 under the Securities Act
for the purpose of registering the shares of PEC Common Stock issuable upon
exercise of the Substituted Options (as hereinafter defined in Section 5.7) have
been duly authorized by PEC's Board of Directors. Except as set forth in Section
2.3 of the PEC Disclosure Schedule, the execution and delivery of this Agreement
or any Stock Option Assumption Agreements or Warrant Assumption Agreements, do
not or will not, as the case may be, and the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby and thereby and compliance with the provisions hereof and
thereof will not, conflict with, or result in any violation of, or default (with
or without notice or lapse of time, or both) under, or give rise to a right of
termination, cancellation or acceleration of any obligation or to the loss of a
material benefit under, or result in the creation of any lien, security
interest, charge or encumbrance upon any of the properties or assets of PEC or
any of its Subsidiaries under, any provision of (i) the Restated Certificate of
Incorporation, as amended, or Bylaws (true and complete copies of which as of
the date hereof have been delivered to UTI) of PEC or any provision of the
comparable charter or organization documents of any of its Subsidiaries, (ii)
any loan or credit agreement, note, bond, mortgage, indenture, lease or other
agreement, instrument, permit, concession, franchise or license applicable to
PEC or any of its Subsidiaries or (iii) any judgment, order, decree, statute,
law, ordinance, rule or regulation applicable to PEC or any of its Subsidiaries
or any of their respective properties or assets, other than, in the case of
clauses (ii) or (iii), any such conflicts, violations, defaults, rights, losses,
liens, security interests, charges or encumbrances that, individually or in the
aggreg ate, would not have a Material Adverse Effect on PEC, materially impair
the ability of PEC to perform its obligations hereunder or under the Stock
Option Assumption Agreements or Warrant Assumption Agreements, or prevent the
consummation of any of the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby. Except
as set forth in Section 2.3 of the PEC Disclosure Schedule, no filing or
registration with, or authorization, consent or approval of, any domestic
(federal and state), foreign or supranational court, commission, governmental
body, regulatory agency, authority or tribunal (a "Governmental Entity") is
required by or with respect to PEC or any of its Subsidiaries in connection with
the execution and delivery of this Agreement by PEC or is necessary for the
consummation by PEC of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by
this Agreement and the issuance of PEC Common Stock pursuant to the Stock Option
Assumption Agreements or Warrant Assumption Agreements, except for (i) in
connection, or in compliance, with the provisions of the Securities Act and the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as

                                       A-6

amended (together with the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, the
"Exchange Act"), (ii) the filing of the Certificate of Merger with the Secretary
of State of the State of Delaware and recording of the Certificate of Merger in
the appropriate county in Delaware after the filing thereof with the Secretary
of State of the State of Delaware and the filing or recording of appropriate
documents with the relevant authorities of other states in which UTI is
qualified to do business, (iii) such filings and consents as may be required
under any environmental, health or safety law or regulation pertaining to any
notification, disclosure or required approval triggered by the Merger or the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (iv) such filings as may be
required in connection with applicable taxes, (v) such consents, approvals,
orders, authorizations, registrations, declarations and filings as may be
required under the corporation, takeover or "Blue Sky" laws of various states,
(vi) such filings and approvals as may be required under Hart-Scott-Rodino
Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976 (the "HSR Act"), and (vii) such other
consents, orders, authorizations, registrations, declarations and filings the
failure of which to be obtained or made would not, individually or in the
aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect on PEC, materially impair the ability
of PEC to perform its obligations hereunder or prevent the consummation of any
of the transactions contemplated hereby.

     SECTION 2.4  SEC Documents.  PEC has filed all required documents with the
SEC since January 1, 1998 (the "PEC SEC Documents"). As of their respective
dates, the PEC SEC Documents complied in all material respects with the
requirements of the Securities Act or the Exchange Act, as the case may be, and
none of the PEC SEC Documents contained any untrue statement of a material fact
or omitted to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary
to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they
were made, not misleading. The consolidated financial statements of PEC included
in the PEC SEC Documents comply as to form in all material respects with
applicable accounting requirements and the published rules and regulations of
the SEC with respect thereto, have been prepared in accordance with generally
accepted accounting principles (except, in the case of the unaudited statements,
as permitted by Form 10-Q of the SEC) applied on a consistent basis during the
periods involved (except as may be indicated therein or in the notes thereto)
and fairly present the consolidated financial position of PEC and its
consolidated Subsidiaries as of the dates thereof and the consolidated results
of their operations and statements of cash flows for the periods then ended
(subject, in the case of unaudited statements, to normal year-end audit
adjustments and to any other adjustments described therein). There is no
liability or obligation of any kind, whether accrued, absolute, fixed or
contingent, of PEC or any Subsidiary of PEC which is required by generally
accepted accounting principles to be reflected or reserved against or otherwise
disclosed in the most recent financial statements of PEC included in the PEC SEC
Documents which is not so reflected or reserved against that individually or in
the aggregate would have a Material Adverse Effect on PEC. For purposes of this
Agreement, "PEC Balance Sheet" means the consolidated balance sheet as of
September 30, 2000, set forth in PEC's Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the
quarter ended September 30, 2000, and "PEC Balance Sheet Date" means September
30, 2000.

     SECTION 2.5  Engineering Reports.  All information supplied to M. Brian
Wallace, an independent petroleum engineer, by or on behalf of PEC and its
Subsidiaries that was material to such engineer's review of PEC's estimates of
oil and gas reserves attributable to the Oil and Gas Interests (as defined
below) of PEC and its Subsidiaries in connection with the preparation of the oil
and gas reserve engineering report concerning the Oil and Gas Interests of PEC
and its Subsidiaries as of December 31, 1999, reviewed by M. Brian Wallace (the
"PEC Engineering Report") was (at the time supplied or as modified or amended
prior to the issuance of the PEC Engineering Report) true and correct in all
material respects. For purposes of this Agreement "Oil and Gas Interests" means,
when used with respect to PEC and each of its Subsidiaries, direct and indirect
interests in and rights with respect to oil, gas, helium, carbon dioxide,
mineral, and related properties and assets of any kind and nature, direct or
indirect, including working, royalty and overriding royalty interests,
production payments, operating rights, net profit interests, other nonworking
interests, and nonoperating interests; all interests in and rights with respect
to oil, condensate, gas, casing-head gas, helium, carbon dioxide and other
liquid or gaseous hydrocarbons (collectively, "Hydrocarbons") and other minerals
or revenues therefrom and all contracts in connection therewith and claims and
rights thereto (including all oil and gas leases, operating agreements,
unitization
                                       A-7

and pooling agreements and orders, division orders, transfer orders, mineral
deeds, royalty deeds, oil and gas sales, exchange and processing contracts and
agreements, and in each case, interests thereunder), surface interests, fee
interests, reversionary interests, reservations, and concessions; all easements,
rights of way, licenses, permits, leases, and other interests associated with,
appurtenant to, or necessary for the operation of any of the foregoing; and all
interests in equipment and machinery (including well equipment and machinery),
oil and gas production, gathering, transmissions, treating, processing, and
storage facilities (including tanks, tank batteries, pipelines, and gathering
systems), pumps, water plants, electric plants, gasoline and gas processing
plants, refineries, and other tangible personal property and fixtures associated
with, appurtenant to, or necessary for the operation of any of the foregoing.
Except for changes in classification or values of oil and gas reserve or
property interests that occurred in the ordinary course of business since
December 31, 1999, and except for changes (including changes in commodity
prices) generally affecting the oil and gas industry on a nationwide basis,
there has been no Material Adverse Change in respect of PEC regarding the
matters addressed in the PEC Engineering Report.

     SECTION 2.6  S-4 Registration Statement and Joint Proxy Statement.  None of
the information to be supplied by PEC for inclusion or incorporation by
reference in the S-4 Registration Statement or the joint proxy statement
(together with any amendments or supplements thereto, the "Joint Proxy
Statement") relating to the Stockholder Meetings (as defined in Section 5.1)
will (i) in the case of the S-4 Registration Statement, at the time it becomes
effective and at the Effective Time, contain any untrue statement of a material
fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or
necessary in order to make the statements therein not misleading or (ii) in the
case of the Joint Proxy Statement, at the time of the mailing of the Joint Proxy
Statement and at the time of the Stockholder Meetings, contain any untrue
statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be
stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of
the circumstances under which they are made, not misleading. If at any time
prior to the Effective Time any event with respect to PEC, its officers and
directors or any of its Subsidiaries shall occur which is required to be
described in the Joint Proxy Statement or the S-4 Registration Statement, such
event shall be so described, and an amendment or supplement shall be promptly
filed with the SEC and, as required by law, disseminated to the stockholders of
UTI and PEC. The S-4 Registration Statement will comply (with respect to PEC and
its Subsidiaries) as to form in all material respects with the provisions of the
Securities Act, and the Joint Proxy Statement will comply (with respect to PEC
and its Subsidiaries) as to form in all material respects with the provisions of
the Exchange Act. No representation or warranty is made by PEC in this Section
2.6 with respect to statements made or incorporated by reference therein based
on information supplied by UTI for inclusion or incorporation by reference in
the Joint Proxy Statement or S-4 Registration Statement.

     SECTION 2.7  Absence of Material Adverse Change.  Except as disclosed in
the PEC SEC Documents filed with the SEC prior to the date hereof, since the PEC
Balance Sheet Date, PEC and its Subsidiaries have conducted their business in
the ordinary course consistent with past practice and there has not been:

          (a) through the date of this Agreement, any event, occurrence or
     development which, individually or in the aggregate, has caused or would be
     reasonably likely to cause a Material Adverse Change with respect to PEC
     (other than changes in generally accepted accounting principles or
     interpretations thereof that the oil and gas contract drilling industry or
     oil and gas industry generally or changes in general economic conditions
     that affect either of those industries on a nationwide basis);

          (b) any declaration, setting aside or payment of any dividend or other
     distribution with respect to any shares of capital stock of PEC or any
     repurchase, redemption or other acquisition by PEC or any Subsidiary of PEC
     of any amount of outstanding shares of capital stock or other equity
     securities of, or other ownership interests in, PEC or any Subsidiary of
     PEC;

          (c) any amendment of any term of any outstanding security of PEC or
     any Subsidiary of PEC that would materially increase the obligations of PEC
     or such Subsidiary under such security;

          (d) (x) any incurrence or assumption by PEC or any Subsidiary of PEC
     of any indebtedness for borrowed money other than under existing credit
     facilities (or any renewals, replacements or
                                       A-8

     extensions thereof that do not materially increase the commitments
     thereunder) in the ordinary course of business consistent with past
     practices (it being understood that any indebtedness incurred prior to the
     date hereof in respect of capital expenditures shall be considered to have
     been in the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice), or
     (y) any guarantee, endorsement or other incurrence or assumption of
     liability (whether directly, contingently or otherwise) by PEC or any
     Subsidiary of PEC for the obligations of any other Person (other than any
     Subsidiary of PEC), other than in the ordinary course of business
     consistent with past practice or in connection with obligations of PEC and
     its Subsidiaries assumed at the Effective Time;

          (e) any creation or assumption by PEC or any Subsidiary of PEC of any
     Lien on any material asset of PEC or any Subsidiary of PEC other than in
     the ordinary course of business consistent with past practices;

          (f) any making of any loan, advance or capital contribution to or
     material investment in any Person by PEC or any Subsidiary of PEC other
     than (i) loans, advances or capital contributions to or investments in
     wholly-owned Subsidiaries of PEC;

          (g) (i) any contract or agreement entered into by PEC or any
     Subsidiary of PEC on or prior to the date hereof relating to any material
     acquisition or disposition of any assets or business or (ii) any
     modification, amendment, assignment, termination or relinquishment by PEC
     or any Subsidiary of PEC of any contract, license or other right (including
     any insurance policy naming it as a beneficiary or a loss payable payee)
     that would be reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse Effect on PEC,
     other than, in the case of (i) and (ii), transactions, commitments,
     contracts or agreements in the ordinary course of business consistent with
     past practices and those contemplated by this Agreement; and

          (h) any material change in any method of account or accounting
     principles or practice by PEC or any Subsidiary of PEC, except for any such
     change required by reason of change in generally accepted accounting
     principles.

     SECTION 2.8  No Undisclosed Material Liabilities.  There have been no
liabilities or obligations (whether pursuant to contracts or otherwise) of any
kind whatsoever incurred by PEC or any Subsidiary of PEC since September 30,
2000, whether accrued, contingent, absolute, determined, determinable or
otherwise, other than:

          (a) liabilities or obligations (i) disclosed or provided for in the
     PEC Balance Sheet or in the notes thereto, (ii) disclosed in the PEC SEC
     Documents filed prior to the date hereof or (iii) disclosed in Section 2.8
     to the PEC Disclosure Schedule;

          (b) liabilities or obligations which, individually and in the
     aggregate, have not had and are not reasonably likely to have a Material
     Adverse Effect on PEC; or

          (c) liabilities or obligations under this Agreement or incurred in
     connection with the transactions contemplated hereby.

     SECTION 2.9  Accounting and Tax Matters.  As of the date hereof, neither
PEC nor any of its Affiliates has taken or agreed to take any action, nor do the
executive officers of PEC have any knowledge of any fact or circumstance, that
would prevent PEC from accounting for the business combination to be effected by
the Merger as a "pooling of interests" or prevent the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement from qualifying as a
"reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code. For purposes
of this Agreement, the term "Affiliate," when used with respect to any Person,

of any present or former employee, any applicant for employment or any classes
of the foregoing alleging breach of any express or implied contract of
employment, any law or regulation governing employment or the termination

                     REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF UTI

     UTI represents and warrants to PEC as follows:

     SECTION 3.1  Organization, Standing and Power.  UTI and each of its
Subsidiaries is a corporation, a limited liability company or a limited

and in good standing under the laws of the jurisdiction of its incorporation and
has the requisite corporate limited liability company or limited partnership
power and authority to own, lease and operate its properties and to carry on its
business as now being conducted. UTI and each of its Subsidiaries is duly
qualified to do business, and is in good standing, in each jurisdiction where
the character of its properties owned or held under lease or the nature of its
activities makes such qualification necessary, except where the failure to be so
qualified would not, individually or in the aggregate, have a Material Adverse
Effect on UTI. Section 3.1 of the disclosure statement of UTI dated as of the
date hereof previously furnished to PEC (the "UTI Disclosure Schedule") a list
of UTI's Subsidiaries.

     SECTION 3.2  Capital Structure.  Except as set forth in Section 3.2 of the
UTI Disclosure Schedule, all of the outstanding equity securities of each
Subsidiary of UTI is owned by UTI, directly or indirectly, free and clear of any
Liens, including any restriction on the right to vote, sell or otherwise dispose
of such equity securities. At the close of business on February 2, 2001, (i)
37,569,461 shares of UTI Common Stock were validly issued and outstanding fully
paid and non-assessable and free of preemptive rights, (ii) a total of 4,287,426
shares of UTI Common Stock were reserved for issuance upon exercise of then
outstanding UTI Stock Options (as defined in Section 5.7) and UTI Warrants (as
defined in Section 5.8), (iii) a total of 1,182,434 additional shares of UTI
Common Stock were reserved for issuance under the UTI Stock Plans (as defined in
Section 5.7), (iv) 1,206,548 shares of UTI Common Stock were held by UTI in its
treasury, and (v) no shares of UTI Preferred Stock were issued and outstanding
and 50,000 were reserved for issuance. There are no outstanding stock
appreciation rights ("SARs"). All outstanding equity securities of UTI are
validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable and not subject to preemptive
rights. Except for UTI Stock Options and UTI Warrants outstanding as of the date
of this Agreement and the additional shares of UTI Common Stock reserved for
issuance under the UTI Stock Plans, there are no options, warrants, rights,
commitments, agreements, arrangements or undertakings of any kind to which UTI
or any of its Subsidiaries is a party or by which any of them is bound
obligating UTI or any of its Subsidiaries to issue, deliver or sell, or cause to
be issued, delivered or sold, additional equity securities or other voting
securities of UTI or its Subsidiaries. True and correct copies of all
agreements, instruments and other governing documents relating to the UTI Stock
Options, UTI Stock Warrants and UTI Stock Plans have been furnished to PEC.

     SECTION 3.3  Authority; Non-Contravention.  The Board of Directors of UTI
has declared the Merger fair to and advisable and in the best interest of the
stockholders of UTI, and UTI has all requisite power and authority to enter into
this Agreement and, subject to approval of the Merger by the stockholders of
UTI, to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby. The execution and
delivery of this Agreement by UTI and the consummation by UTI of the
transactions contemplated hereby have been duly authorized by all necessary
corporate action on the part of UTI, subject to such approval of the Merger by
the stockholders of UTI. This Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by
UTI and (assuming the valid authorization, execution and delivery of this
Agreement by PEC) constitutes a valid and binding obligation of UTI enforceable
against UTI in accordance with its terms, except to the extent enforceability
may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium, fraudulent
transfer or other similar laws of general applicability relating to or affecting
the enforcement of creditors' rights and by the effect of general principles of
equity (regardless of whether enforceability is considered in a proceeding in
equity or at law). Except as set forth in Section 3.3 of the UTI Disclosure
Schedule, the execution and delivery of this Agreement do not, and the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby and compliance with the
provisions hereof will not, conflict with, or result in any violation of, or
default (with or without notice or lapse of time, or both) under, or give rise
to a right of termination, cancellation or acceleration of any obligation or to
the loss of a material benefit under, or result in the

                                       A-15

creation of any lien, security interest, charge or encumbrance upon any of the
properties or assets of UTI or any of its Subsidiaries under, any provision of
(i) the Restated Certificate of Incorporation, as amended, or Bylaws of UTI
(true and complete copies of which as of the date hereof have been delivered to
PEC) or any provision of the comparable charter or organizational documents of
any of its Subsidiaries, (ii) any loan or credit agreement, note, bond,
mortgage, indenture, lease or other agreement, instrument, permit, concession,
franchise or license applicable to UTI or any of its Subsidiaries or (iii) any
judgment, order, decree, statute, law, ordinance, rule or regulation applicable
to UTI or any of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective properties or
assets, other than, in the case of clauses (ii) or (iii), any such conflicts,
violations, defaults, rights, liens, losses, security interests, charges or
encumbrances that, individually or in the aggregate, would not have a Material
Adverse Effect on UTI, materially impair the ability of UTI to perform its
obligations hereunder or prevent the consummation of any of the transactions
contemplated hereby. Except as set forth in Section 3.3 of the UTI Disclosure
Schedule, no filing or registration with, or authorization, consent or approval
of, any Governmental Entity is required by or with respect to UTI or any of its
Subsidiaries in connection with the execution and delivery of this Agreement by
UTI or is necessary for the consummation by UTI of the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, except for (i) in connection, or in
compliance, with the provisions of the Securities Act and the Exchange Act, (ii)
the filing of the Certificate of Merger with the Secretary of State of the State
of Delaware and recording of the Certificate of Merger in the appropriate county
in Delaware after the filing thereof with the Secretary of State of the State of
Delaware and the filing or recording of appropriate documents with the relevant
authorities of other states in which UTI or any of its Subsidiaries is qualified
to do business, (iii) such filings and consents as may be required under any
environmental, health or safety law or regulation pertaining to any
notification, disclosure or required approval triggered by the Merger or the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (iv) such filings as may be
required in connection with applicable taxes, (v) such other consents,
approvals, orders, authorizations, registrations, declarations and filings as
may be required under the corporation, takeover or "Blue Sky" laws of various
states, (vi) such filings and approvals as may be required under the HSR Act
and, if any, similar laws in Canada, and (vi) such other consents, approvals,
orders, authorizations, registrations, declarations and filings the failure of
which to be obtained or made would not, individually or in the aggregate, have a
Material Adverse Effect on UTI, materially impair the ability of UTI to perform
its obligations hereunder or prevent the consummation of any of the transactions
contemplated hereby.

     SECTION 3.4  SEC Documents.  UTI has filed all required documents with the
SEC since January 1, 1998 (the "UTI SEC Documents"). As of their respective
dates, the UTI SEC Documents complied in all material respects with the
requirements of the Securities Act or the Exchange Act, as the case may be, and
none of the UTI SEC Documents contained any untrue statement of a material fact
or omitted to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary
in order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under
which they were made, not misleading. The consolidated financial statements of
UTI included in the UTI SEC Documents comply as to form in all material respects
with applicable accounting requirements and the published rules and regulations
of the SEC with respect thereto, have been prepared in accordance with generally
accepted accounting principles (except, in the case of unaudited statements, as
permitted by Form 10-Q of the SEC) applied on a consistent basis during the
periods involved (except as may be indicated therein or in the notes thereto)
and fairly present the financial position of UTI and its consolidated
Subsidiaries as at the dates thereof and the consolidated results of their
operations and changes in financial position for the periods then ended
(subject, in the case of unaudited statements, to normal year-end audit

     SECTION 4.2  No Solicitation.  During the period from the date of this
Agreement until the Effective Time and except as expressly permitted by the
following provisions of this Section 4.2, UTI will not, and will not permit or
cause any of its Subsidiaries or any of the officers and directors of it or its
Subsidiaries to, and shall direct and use its best efforts to cause its
Subsidiaries and its Subsidiaries' employees, agents and representatives
(including any investment banker, attorney or accountant retained by it or any
of its Subsidiaries) not to, directly or indirectly, initiate, solicit, or
knowingly encourage or otherwise intentionally facilitate any inquiries or the
making of any proposal or offer (other than the

                                       A-24

Merger) with respect to a merger, reorganization, share exchange, consolidation
or similar transaction involving, or any purchase of all or a substantial
portion of the assets or any equity securities of it or any of its Subsidiaries
(any such proposal or offer being hereinafter referred to as a "UTI Acquisition
Proposal"). UTI will not, and will not permit or cause any of its Subsidiaries
or any of the officers and directors of it or its Subsidiaries to and shall
direct and use its best efforts to cause its and its Subsidiaries' employees,
agents and representatives (including any investment banker, attorney or
accountant retained by it or any of its Subsidiaries) not to, directly or
indirectly, engage in any negotiations concerning, or provide any confidential
information or data to, or have any discussions with, any Person relating to a
UTI Acquisition Proposal, whether made before or after the date of this
Agreement, or otherwise intentionally facilitate any effort or attempt to make
or implement a UTI Acquisition Proposal; provided, however, that nothing
contained in this Agreement shall prevent UTI or its Board of Directors from
complying with Rule 14e-2 promulgated under the Exchange Act with regard to a
UTI Acquisition Proposal or at any time prior to the time that the Merger shall
have been approved by the stockholders of UTI at the UTI Stockholder Meeting (as
defined below in Section 5.1(a)) (A) providing information in response to a
request therefor by a Person who has made an unsolicited bona fide written UTI
Acquisition Proposal if the Board of Directors receives from the Person so
requesting such information an executed confidentiality agreement the terms of
which are (without regard to the terms of the UTI Acquisition Proposal) (x) no
less favorable to UTI and (y) no less restrictive on the Person requesting such
information than those contained in the confidentiality agreement between UTI
and PEC dated as of the date of this Agreement (the "Confidentiality
Agreement"); (B) engaging in any negotiations or discussions with any Person who
has made an unsolicited bona fide written UTI Acquisition Proposal; or (C)
recommending such a UTI Acquisition Proposal to the stockholders of UTI, if and
only to the extent that, (i) in each such case referred to in clause (A), (B) or
(C) above, the Board of Directors of UTI determines in good faith after
consultation with outside legal counsel that such action is necessary in order
for its directors to comply with their respective fiduciary duties under
applicable law and (ii) in each case referred to in clause (B) or (C) above, the
Board of Directors of UTI determines in good faith (after consultation with its
financial advisor) that such UTI Acquisition Proposal, if accepted, is
reasonably likely to be consummated, taking into account all legal, financial
and regulatory aspects of the proposal and the Person making the proposal and
would, if consummated, result in a transaction more favorable to UTI's
stockholders from a financial point of view than the transaction contemplated by
this Agreement (any such more favorable UTI Acquisition Proposal being referred
to in this Agreement as a "Superior Proposal"). UTI will immediately cease and
cause to be terminated any existing activities, discussions or negotiations with
any parties conducted heretofore with respect to any of the foregoing. UTI
agrees that it will take the necessary steps to promptly inform the individuals
or entities referred to in the first sentence hereof of the obligations
undertaken in this Section 4.2 and in the Confidentiality Agreement. UTI will
promptly notify PEC if after the date hereof any such inquiries, proposals or
offers are received by, any such information is requested from, or any such
discussions or negotiations are sought to be initiated or continued with, any of
its representatives indicating, in connection with such notice, the name of such
Person and the material terms and conditions of any proposals or offers and
thereafter shall keep PEC informed, on a current basis, on the status and terms
of any such proposals or offers and the status of any such negotiations or
discussions. UTI also will promptly request each Person that has heretofore
executed a confidentiality agreement in connection with its consideration of a
UTI Acquisition Proposal to return or destroy all confidential information
heretofore furnished to such Person by or behalf of it or any of its
Subsidiaries. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in this Section 4.2 shall
be deemed to prevent UTI from selling or disposing of the capital stock or
assets of any Subsidiary (or any actions in preparation or contemplation
thereof) to the extent such sale or disposition is permitted by Section 4.1(a).
Without limiting the foregoing, it is understood that any violation of the
restrictions set forth in this Section 4.2 by an officer or director, employee
or representative of it or any of its Subsidiaries shall be deemed a breach of
this Section 4.2 by UTI.

     SECTION 4.3  No Solicitation.  During the period from the date of this
Agreement until the Effective Time and except as expressly permitted by the
following provisions of this Section 4.3, PEC will not, and will not permit or
cause any of its Subsidiaries or any of the officers and directors of it or its

                                       A-25

Subsidiaries to, and shall direct and use its best efforts to cause its
Subsidiaries and its Subsidiaries' employees, agents and representatives
(including any investment banker, attorney or accountant retained by it or any
of its Subsidiaries) not to, directly or indirectly, initiate, solicit, or
knowingly encourage or otherwise intentionally facilitate any inquiries or the
making of any proposal or offer (other than the Merger) with respect to a
merger, reorganization, share exchange, consolidation or similar transaction
involving, or any purchase of all or a substantial portion of the assets or any
equity securities of it or any of its Subsidiaries (any such proposal or offer
being hereinafter referred to as a "PEC Acquisition Proposal"). PEC will not,
and will not permit or cause any of its Subsidiaries or any of the officers and
directors of it or its Subsidiaries to and shall direct and use its best efforts
to cause its and its Subsidiaries' employees, agents and representatives
(including any investment banker, attorney or accountant retained by it or any
of its Subsidiaries) not to, directly or indirectly, engage in any negotiations
concerning, or provide any confidential information or data to, or have any
discussions with, any Person relating to a PEC Acquisition Proposal, whether
made before or after the date of this Agreement, or otherwise intentionally
facilitate any effort or attempt to make or implement a PEC Acquisition
Proposal; provided, however, that nothing contained in this Agreement shall
prevent PEC or its Board of Directors from complying with Rule 14e-2 promulgated
under the Exchange Act with regard to a PEC Acquisition Proposal or at any time
prior to the time that the Merger shall have been approved by the stockholders
of PEC at the PEC Stockholder Meeting (as defined below in Section 5.1(b)) (A)
providing information in response to a request therefor by a Person who has made
an unsolicited bona fide written PEC Acquisition Proposal if the Board of
Directors receives from the Person so requesting such information an executed
confidentiality agreement the terms of which are (without regard to the terms of
the PEC Acquisition Proposal) (x) no less favorable to PEC and (y) no less
restrictive on the Person requesting such information than those contained in
the confidentiality agreement between PEC and UTI dated as of the date of this
Agreement (the "Confidentiality Agreement"); (B) engaging in any negotiations or
discussions with any Person who has made an unsolicited bona fide written PEC
Acquisition Proposal; or (C) recommending such a PEC Acquisition Proposal to the
stockholders of PEC, if and only to the extent that, (i) in each such case
referred to in clause (A), (B) or (C) above, the Board of Directors of PEC
determines in good faith after consultation with outside legal counsel that such
action is necessary in order for its directors to comply with their respective
fiduciary duties under applicable law and (ii) in each case referred to in
clause (B) or (C) above, the Board of Directors of PEC determines in good faith
(after consultation with its financial advisor) that such PEC Acquisition
Proposal, if accepted, is reasonably likely to be consummated, taking into
account all legal, financial and regulatory aspects of the proposal and the
Person making the proposal and would, if consummated, result in a transaction
more favorable to PEC's stockholders from a financial point of view than the
transaction contemplated by this Agreement (any such more favorable PEC
Acquisition Proposal being referred to in this Agreement as a "Superior
Proposal"). PEC will immediately cease and cause to be terminated any existing
activities, discussions or negotiations with any parties conducted heretofore
with respect to any of the foregoing. PEC agrees that it will take the necessary
steps to promptly inform the individuals or entities referred to in the first
sentence hereof of the obligations undertaken in this Section 4.3 and in the
Confidentiality Agreement. PEC will promptly notify UTI if after the date hereof
any such inquiries, proposals or offers are received by, any such information is
requested from, or any such discussions or negotiations are sought to be
initiated or continued with, any of its representatives indicating, in
connection with such notice, the name of such Person and the material terms and
conditions of any proposals or offers and thereafter shall keep UTI informed, on
a current basis, on the status and terms of any such proposals or offers and the
status of any such negotiations or discussions. PEC also will promptly request
each Person that has heretofore executed a confidentiality agreement in
connection with its consideration of a PEC Acquisition Proposal to return or
destroy all confidential information heretofore furnished to such Person by or
behalf of it or any of its Subsidiaries. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing
in this Section 4.3 shall be deemed to prevent PEC from selling or disposing of
the capital stock or assets of any Subsidiary (or any actions in preparation or
contemplation thereof) to the extent such sale or disposition is permitted by
Section 4.1(a). Without limiting the foregoing, it is understood that any
violation of the restrictions set forth in this Section 4.3 by an officer or
director, employee or representative of it or any of its Subsidiaries shall be
deemed a breach of this Section 4.3 by PEC.
                                       A-26

     SECTION 4.4  Accounting and Tax Matters.  During the period from the date
of this Agreement through the Effective Time, unless the other parties shall
otherwise agree in writing, none of PEC or any Subsidiary of PEC, nor UTI or any
subsidiary of UTI shall (a) knowingly take or fail to take any action which
action or failure to act would jeopardize the treatment of UTI's combination
with PEC as a pooling of interests for accounting purposes or (b) knowingly take
or fail to take any action which action or failure to act would jeopardize
qualification of the Merger as a reorganization within the meaning of Section
368(a) of the Code.

                                   ARTICLE V

                             ADDITIONAL AGREEMENTS

     SECTION 5.1  Stockholder Approval.

     (a) UTI shall promptly call a meeting of its stockholders (the "UTI
Stockholder Meeting") for the purpose of voting upon the Merger and shall use
its reasonable best efforts to obtain stockholder approval of the Merger. The
UTI Stockholder Meeting shall be held as soon as practicable following the date
upon which the S-4 Registration Statement becomes effective, and UTI, through
its Board of Directors, subject to fiduciary duties under applicable law, will
recommend to its stockholders the approval of the Merger, will not rescind or
modify its declaration that the Merger is fair to and advisable and in the best
interest of UTI and its stockholders and will take all lawful action to solicit
such approval; provided that UTI's Board of Directors may rescind or modify such
declaration following receipt of a Superior Proposal.

     (b) PEC shall promptly call a meeting of its stockholders (the "PEC
Stockholder Meeting" and, together with the UTI Stockholder Meeting, the
"Stockholder Meetings") for the purpose of voting upon the Merger and the
Charter Amendment and shall use its reasonable best efforts to obtain
stockholder approval of such matters. PEC will, through its Board of Directors
(unless the Board of Directors shall conclude in good faith, after consultation
with and based upon the written advice of its outside legal counsel (which
advice need not constitute an opinion), that not recommending the Merger and
Charter Amendment, or withdrawing or modifying any such recommendation, is
necessary in order for the Board of Directors not to breach its fiduciary
obligations under applicable law), recommend to its stockholders the approval of
the Merger and Charter Amendment and not rescind its declaration that such
transactions are fair to and advisable and in the best interest of PEC and its
stockholders and take all lawful action to solicit such approval; provided that
PEC's Board of Directors may rescind or modify such declaration following
receipt of a Superior Proposal. The PEC Stockholder Meeting shall be on the date
of UTI Stockholder Meeting or, if such date is not practicable, on the closest
date practicable.

     SECTION 5.2  S-4 Registration Statement and Joint Proxy Statement.  PEC and
UTI shall prepare and file with the SEC as soon as practicable a proxy statement
for use at the Stockholder Meetings (the "Joint Proxy Statement"), and PEC shall
prepare and file with the SEC as soon as practicable the S-4 Registration
Statement (including the Joint Proxy Statement as a prospectus therein) and
shall use all reasonable efforts to have the S-4 Registration Statement declared
effective by the SEC as soon as practicable. PEC shall also take any action
required to be taken under state securities or "Blue Sky" laws in connection
with the issuance of the Surviving Corporation Common Stock pursuant to the
Merger and the exercise of the Substituted Options (as defined in Section 5.7)
and the Substituted Warrants (as defined in Section 5.8) after the Effective
Time. UTI and PEC shall furnish each other all information concerning UTI and
the holders of UTI Common Stock or PEC and the holders of PEC Common Stock, as
the case may be, required for use in the S-4 Registration Statement and the
Joint Proxy Statement, and UTI and PEC each shall take such other actions as the
other may reasonably request in connection with the preparation of the S-4
Registration Statement and the Joint Proxy Statement and the actions to be taken
pursuant to this Section 5.2.

     SECTION 5.3  Access to Information.

     (a) UTI shall, and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to, afford to PEC,
and to PEC's accountants, counsel, financial advisers and other representatives,
reasonable access and permit them to make such
                                       A-27

inspections as they may reasonably require during the period from the date of
this Agreement through the Effective Time to all their respective properties,
books, contracts, commitments and records and, during such period, UTI shall,
and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to furnish promptly to PEC (i) access
to each report, schedule, registration statement and other document filed by it
during such period pursuant to the requirements of federal or state laws and
(ii) all other information concerning UTI, its business, properties and
personnel as PEC may reasonably request. UTI shall be entitled to have a
representative present at any such inspection. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
UTI shall not be obligated to provide any information if UTI shall have been
advised by legal counsel that the provision of such information may violate
Federal or State antirust laws. Except as required by law, PEC will hold, and
will cause its affiliates, associates and representatives to hold, any nonpublic
information in confidence until such time as such information otherwise becomes
publicly available and shall use its reasonable best efforts to ensure that such
affiliates, associates and representatives do not disclose such information to
others without the prior written consent of UTI. In the event of termination of
this Agreement for any reason, PEC shall promptly return or destroy all
nonpublic documents so obtained from UTI and any copies made of such documents
for PEC. PEC shall not, and shall cause its affiliates, associates and
representatives not to, use any nonpublic information regarding UTI and its
Subsidiaries in any way detrimental to UTI and its Subsidiaries.

     (b) PEC shall, and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to, afford to UTI,
and to UTI's accountants, counsel, financial advisers and other representatives,
reasonable access and permit them to make such inspections as they may
reasonably require during the period from the date of this Agreement through the
Effective Time to all their respective properties, books, contracts, commitments
and records and, during such period, PEC shall, and shall cause each of its
Subsidiaries to, furnish promptly to UTI (i) access to each report, schedule,
registration statement and other document filed by it during such period
pursuant to the requirements of federal or state laws and (ii) all other
information concerning PEC, its business, properties and personnel as UTI may
reasonably request. PEC shall be entitled to have a representative present at
any such inspection. Notwithstanding the foregoing, PEC shall not be obligated
to provide any information if PEC shall have been advised by legal counsel that
the provision of such information may violate Federal or State antirust laws.
Except as required by law, UTI will hold, and will cause its affiliates,
associates and representatives to hold, any nonpublic information in confidence
until such time as such information otherwise becomes publicly available and
shall use its reasonable best efforts to ensure that such affiliates, associates
and representatives do not disclose such information to others without the prior
written consent of PEC. In the event of termination of this Agreement for any
reason, UTI shall promptly return or destroy all nonpublic documents so obtained
from PEC and any copies made of such documents for UTI. UTI shall not, and shall
cause its affiliates, associates and representatives not to, use any nonpublic
information regarding PEC in any way detrimental to PEC and its Subsidiaries.

     (c) No investigation pursuant to this Section 5.3 shall affect any
representation or warranty in this Agreement of any party hereto or any
condition to the obligations of the parties hereto.

     SECTION 5.4  Compliance with the Securities Act; Pooling of
Interests.  Each of PEC and UTI shall deliver to the other party, no later than
20 days after the date of this Agreement, a letter identifying each person whom
it reasonably believes is an "affiliate" of such party for purposes of Rule 145
under the Securities Act. Thereafter and until the date of UTI Stockholder
Meeting or the PEC Stockholder Meeting, as the case may be, each of PEC and UTI
shall identify to the other party each additional person whom it reasonably
believes to have thereafter become an "affiliate." Each of PEC and UTI shall use
its reasonable best efforts to cause each person who is identified as an
"affiliate" pursuant to the two immediately preceding sentences to deliver to
PEC (for itself and as the Surviving Corporation) and UTI, not later than the
date 30 days prior to the expected Effective Time, a written agreement,
substantially in the form of Exhibit I(A) or (B) to this Agreement, as
applicable.

     SECTION 5.5  Nasdaq National Market.  PEC shall use its reasonable best
efforts to list on the Nasdaq National Market, upon official notice of issuance,
the shares of Surviving Corporation Common Stock to be issued in connection with
the Merger and pursuant to the Substituted Options and UTI Stock Plans (as
defined in Section 5.7) and Substituted Warrants (as defined in Section 5.8).
                                       A-28

     SECTION 5.6  Expenses.  The Surviving Corporation shall pay all charges and
expenses, including those of the Exchange Agent, in connection with the
transactions contemplated in Article I. Except as otherwise provided in Sections
7.5(b) and 7.5(c), whether or not the Merger is consummated, all costs and
expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement and the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be paid by the party incurring
such expense, except that the expenses incurred in connection with the filing
fees for the S-4 Registration Statement and the HSR filing and printing and
mailing the Joint Proxy Statement and the S-4 Registration Statement shall be
shared equally by PEC and UTI.

     SECTION 5.7  UTI Stock Options; UTI Stock Plans.  No later than the
Effective Time, each option to purchase shares of UTI Common Stock (a "UTI Stock
Option") which is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time pursuant
to UTI's stock option plans in effect on the date of this Agreement (the "UTI
Stock Plans") shall become and represent an option to purchase the number of
shares of Surviving Corporation Common Stock (a "Substituted Option") (decreased
to the nearest full share) determined by multiplying (i) the number of shares of
UTI Common Stock subject to such UTI Stock Option immediately prior to the
Effective Time by (ii) the Exchange Ratio, at an exercise price per share of
Surviving Corporation Common Stock (rounded down to the nearest whole cent)
equal to the exercise price per share of UTI Common Stock immediately prior to
the Effective Time divided by the Exchange Ratio. PEC shall pay cash to holders
of UTI Stock Options in lieu of issuing fractional shares of Surviving
Corporation Common Stock upon the exercise of Substituted Options for shares of
Surviving Corporation Common Stock. After the Effective Time, except as provided
above in this Section 5.7, each Substituted Option shall be exercisable upon the
same terms and conditions as were applicable under the related UTI Stock Option
after giving effect to any existing provision in UTI Stock Plans that provide
for the automatic acceleration of vesting upon consummation of change in control
of UTI. In the case of any UTI Stock Option to which Section 421 of the Code
applies by reason of its qualification under any of Sections 422 and 424 of the
Code ("qualified stock options"), the option price, the number of shares
purchasable pursuant to such option and the terms and conditions of exercise of
such Substituted Option shall be determined in such manner so as to comply with
Section 424 of the Code. PEC agrees to take such action as may be required under
UTI Stock Plans to effectuate the foregoing, including reservation, issuance and
listing of Surviving Corporation Common Stock as is necessary to effectuate the
transactions contemplated by this Section 5.7, including execution and delivery,
prior to or at the Effective Time, of the UTI Energy Corp. Stock Option
Assumption Agreement (the "Stock Option Assumption Agreement"), substantially in
the form attached hereto as Exhibit II, to holders of UTI Stock Options.

     Promptly after the Effective Time, Surviving Corporation shall prepare and
file with the SEC a Registration Statement on Form S-8 (the "S-8 Registration
Statement") covering the Substituted Options. If necessary to permit reoffers
and resales by optionees, PEC shall also prepare a "reoffer prospectus" (as that
term is used in General Instruction C-1 of Form S-8) and file the reoffer
prospectus with a post-effective amendment to the S-8 Registration Statement and
cause any such post-effective amendment to become effective and remain effective
for such period as is necessary to permit such reoffers and resales.

     SECTION 5.8  UTI Warrants.  No later than the Effective Time, each warrant
to purchase shares of UTI Common Stock (a "UTI Warrant"), which is outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall become and represent at the
Effective Time a fully-vested, immediately exercisable warrant to purchase a
number of shares of PEC Common Stock (a "Substituted Warrant") (decreased to the
nearest full share) determined by multiplying (i) the number of shares of UTI
Common Stock subject to such UTI Warrants immediately prior to the Effective
Time by (ii) the Exchange Ratio, at an exercise price per share of PEC's Common
Stock (rounded down to the nearest whole cent) equal to the exercise price per
share of PEC Common Stock immediately prior to the Effective Time divided by the
Exchange Ratio. PEC shall pay cash to holder of UTI Warrants in lieu of issuing
fractional shares of PEC Common Stock upon the exercise of Substituted Warrants
for shares of PEC Common Stock. PEC agrees to take such action as may be
required under the UTI Warrants to effectuate the foregoing, including execution
and

                                       A-29

delivery prior to or at the Effective Time, of the UTI Energy Corp. Warrant
Assumption Agreement (the "Warrant Assumption Agreement"), in the form agreeable
to the parties, to each holder of UTI Warrants.

     SECTION 5.9  Reasonable Efforts.  Upon the terms and subject to the
conditions set forth in this Agreement, each of the parties agrees to use all
reasonable efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and to do, or
cause to be done, and to assist and cooperate with the other party in doing, all
things necessary, proper or advisable to consummate and make effective, in the
most expeditious manner practicable, the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and the prompt satisfaction of the conditions
hereto, including (a) the obtaining of all necessary actions or non-actions,
waivers, consents and approvals from Governmental Entities and the making of all
necessary registrations and filings and the taking of all reasonable steps as
may be necessary to obtain an approval or waiver from, or to avoid an action or
proceeding by, any Governmental Entity, including, but not limited to, any
filing under the Improvements Act, (b) the obtaining of all necessary consents,
approvals or waivers from third parties, (c) the defending of any lawsuits or
other legal proceedings, whether judicial or administrative, challenging this
Agreement or the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, including
seeking to have any stay or temporary restraining order entered by any court or
other Governmental Entity vacated or reversed, and (d) the execution and
delivery of any additional instruments necessary to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement; provided, however, that neither of the parties
shall be under any obligation to take any action to the extent that the Board of
Directors of such party shall conclude in good faith, after consultation with
and based upon the written advice of the respective outside legal counsel to UTI
and PEC (which advice in each case need not constitute an opinion), that such
action would cause a breach of that board of directors' fiduciary obligations
under applicable law.

     SECTION 5.10  Public Announcements.  Before issuing any press release or
otherwise making any public statements with respect to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, PEC and UTI will consult with each other, and
will undertake reasonable efforts to agree upon the terms of such press release,
and shall not issue any such press release or make any such public statement
prior to such consultation, except as may be required by applicable law or by
obligations pursuant to any listing agreement with the Nasdaq National Market.

     SECTION 5.11  Indemnification; Directors and Officers Insurance.  From and
after the Effective Time, PEC agrees to indemnify and hold harmless all past and
present officers and directors of UTI to the full extent such persons may be
indemnified by UTI pursuant to UTI's Restated Certificate of Incorporation, as
amended, and Bylaws for acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective
Time and shall promptly advance reasonable litigation expenses incurred by such
officers and directors (the "Indemnified Party") in connection with
investigating, preparing and defending any action arising out of such acts or
omissions. In addition, PEC will provide for a period of not less than six years
from the Effective Time, UTI's current directors and officers with an insurance
and indemnification policy that provides coverage for events occurring through
the Effective Time (the "D&O Insurance") that is no less favorable than the
existing policy or, if substantially equivalent insurance coverage is
unavailable, the best available coverage; provided; however, that PEC shall not
be required to pay an annual premium for the D&O Insurance in excess of two
times the last annual premium paid by UTI prior to the date hereof, which annual
premium UTI represents and warrants to have been $150,000 in the aggregate), but
in such case shall purchase as much coverage as possible for such amount. If the
Surviving Corporation or any of its successors or assigns (i) consolidated with
or merges into any other person and shall not be the continuing or surviving
corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers all or
substantially all of its properties and assets to any person, then in each such
case, proper provisions shall be made so that the successors and assigns of the
Surviving Corporation, which shall be financially responsible persons or
entities, assume the obligations set forth in this Section 5.11. The provisions
of this Section 5.11 are intended to be for the benefit of and shall be
enforceable by, the parties hereto and each Indemnified Party and his or her
heirs and representatives.

Plans, other than the UTI Stock Plans, the UTI Energy Corporation 401(k) Plan
and any other qualified plan, shall terminate,

benefit plans and programs shall be distributed to the eligible recipients in
accordance with the terms of such plans of UTI; with respect to the UTI Energy
Corporation 401(k) Plan, the parties may elect prior to the Effective Time to
freeze benefit accruals thereunder as of the Effective Time. The officers and
employees of UTI who continue as employees of the PEC and its Subsidiaries,
shall be provided with employee benefits under plans and programs which, in the
aggregate, are no less favorable than those provided pursuant to the plans and
programs of PEC and its Subsidiaries in effect on the date hereof for the
benefit of all officers and employees of PEC or any of its Subsidiaries
(including but not limited to stock option, life insurance, medical, profit
sharing (including 401(k)), severance, salary continuation and fringe benefits).
For purposes of eligibility to participate in and vesting in benefits provided
to officers and employees, individuals who are officers and employees of UTI at
the Effective Time who continue as employees of the Surviving Corporation, will
be immediately eligible to participate in any qualified plan maintained and
sponsored by PEC or its Subsidiaries and will be credited with vesting service
for their years of service with UTI and its Subsidiaries and years of service
with prior employers to the extent service with prior employers is taken into
account under analogous plans of UTI. PEC and its Subsidiaries will take such
actions as are necessary so that each employee of UTI who continues as an
employee of PEC or one of its Subsidiaries shall not be subject to preexisting
condition exclusions or waiting periods for welfare benefit plan coverages under
any PEC Benefit Plan and shall receive full credit for any copayments and
deductibles already incurred under a UTI Benefit Plan during the applicable year
in which the Effective Time occurs.

     SECTION 5.13  Takeover Statutes.  If any "fair price," "moratorium,"
"control share acquisition" or other antitakeover statute or regulation enacted
under state or federal laws in the United States, including, without limitation,
Section 203 of the DGCA Code (each, a "Takeover Statute," and collectively,
"Takeover Statutes"), is or may become applicable to the Merger, UTI or the
transactions contemplated thereby, UTI and the members of the its Board of
Directors will grant such approvals and take such actions as are necessary so
that the transactions contemplated by this Agreement may be consummated as
promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated hereby and thereby and
otherwise act to eliminate or minimize the effects of any Takeover Statute on
any of the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby.

     SECTION 5.14  Tax Matters.  (a) Each of PEC and UTI shall use its best
efforts to cause the Merger to be treated as a reorganization within the meaning
of Section 368(a) of the Code , and neither UTI nor PEC (nor any of their
respective Subsidiaries) will take or omit to take any action (whether before,
at or after the Effective Time) that would cause the Merger not to be so
treated. PEC and UTI will furnish such certificates as may be reasonably
requested by legal counsel to PEC and UTI in connection with the rendering of
the opinions described in Sections 6.2(f) and 6.3(d).

     (b) The parties and their Subsidiaries will characterize the Merger as a

of UTI Common Stock (including the 121,500 shares of UTI Common Stock underlying
the UTI Warrants) covered by the registration rights agreements to which UTI is
a party as of the date of this Agreement (treating for that purpose UTI as the
Issuer and UTI Common Stock as the Registrable Securities thereunder, and
construing the other provisions thereof accordingly).

     SECTION 5.16  Letter of UTI's Accountants.  UTI shall use its best efforts
to cause to be delivered to PEC a letter of Ernst & Young LLP, UTI's independent
public accountants, dated a date within two business days before the date on
which the S-4 shall become effective and addressed to PEC and UTI, in form and
substance reasonably satisfactory to PEC and customary in scope and substance
for letters delivered by independent public accountants in connection with
registration statements similar to the S-4. In connection with UTI's efforts to
obtain such letter, if requested by UTI, PEC shall provide a representation
letter to Ernst & Young LLP complying with SAS 72, if then required.

form and substance reasonably satisfactory to UTI and customary in scope and

license, dispose of, or hold separate, or to operate in any specified manner,
any material assets or businesses of PEC, UTI or the Surviving Corporation (or
to require PEC, UTI or any of their respective Subsidiaries or affiliates to

the date of this Agreement through the effective time of the Merger, neither

                                   ARTICLE VI

             (i) The incorporation, existence and good standing of PEC are as
        stated in this Agreement; the authorized shares of PEC are as stated in
        this Agreement; all outstanding shares of Surviving Corporation Common
        Stock are duly and validly authorized and issued, fully paid and
        nonassessable and have not been issued in violation of any preemptive
        right of any stockholders.

             (ii) PEC has full corporate power and authority to execute, deliver
        and perform this Agreement and this Agreement has been duly authorized,
        executed and delivered by PEC and (assuming due and valid authorization,
        execution and delivery by UTI) constitutes the legal, valid and binding
        agreement of PEC, enforceable against PEC in accordance with its terms,
        except to the extent enforceability may be limited by bankruptcy,
        insolvency, reorganization, moratorium, fraudulent transfer or other
        similar laws of general applicability relating to or affecting the
        enforcement of creditors' rights and by the effect of general principles
        of equity (regardless of whether enforceability is considered in a
        proceeding in equity or at law).

             (iii) PEC has full corporate power and authority to execute,
        deliver and perform each of the Stock Option Assumption Agreements and
        each of the Warrant Assumption Agreements and each such Stock Option
        Assumption Agreement and Warrant Assumption Agreement has been duly
        authorized, executed and delivered by PEC and (assuming due and valid
        execution and delivery by the other party to such Stock Option

        the legal, valid and binding agreement of PEC,
                                       A-34

        enforceable against PEC in accordance with its terms, except to the
        extent enforceability may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency,
        reorganization, moratorium, fraudulent transfer or other similar laws of
        general applicability relating to or affecting the enforcement of
        creditors' rights and by the effect of general principles of equity

             (iv) The execution and performance by PEC of this Agreement and the
        various Stock Option Assumption Agreements and Warrant Assumption
        Agreements will not violate the Restated Certificate of Incorporation,
        as amended, or Bylaws of PEC and, to the knowledge of such counsel, will
        not violate, result in a breach of or constitute a default under any
        material lease, mortgage, contract, agreement, instrument, law, rule,
        regulation, judgment, order or decree to which PEC is a party or by
        which it or any of its properties or assets may be bound.

             (v) To the knowledge of such counsel, no consent, approval,
        authorization or order of any court or governmental agency or body which
        has not been obtained is required on behalf of PEC for the consummation
        of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, the Stock Option
        Assumption Agreements or the Warrant Assumption Agreements.

             (vi) To the knowledge of such counsel, there are no actions, suits
        or proceedings, pending or threatened against or affecting PEC or its
        Subsidiaries by any Governmental Entity which seek to restrain, prohibit
        or invalidate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

             (vii) (A) At the time the S-4 Registration Statement became
        effective, the S-4 Registration Statement and the Joint Proxy Statement
        (other than the financial statements and related notes, financial data,
        statistical data and supporting schedules included therein, and
        information relating to or supplied by UTI as to which such counsel
        expresses no opinion) complied as to form in all material respects with
        the requirements of the Securities Act and the Exchange Act.

                (B) In the course of the preparation of the S-4 Registration
           Statement and the Joint Proxy Statement such counsel has considered
           the information set forth therein in light of the matters required to
           be set forth therein, and has participated in conferences with
           officers and representatives of UTI and PEC, including their
           respective counsel and independent public accountants, during the
           course of which the contents of the S-4 Registration Statement and
           the Joint Proxy Statement and related matters were discussed. Such
           counsel has not independently checked the accuracy or completeness
           of, or otherwise verified, and accordingly is not passing upon, and
           does not assume responsibility for, the accuracy, completeness or
           fairness of the statements contained in the S-4 Registration
           Statement or the Joint Proxy Statement; and such counsel has relied
           as to materiality, to a large extent, upon the judgment of officers
           and representatives of UTI and PEC. However, as a result of such
           consideration and participation, nothing has come to such counsel's
           attention which causes such counsel to believe that the S-4
           Registration Statement (other than the financial statements and
           related notes, financial data, statistical data and supporting
           schedules included therein, and information relating to or supplied
           by UTI as to which such counsel expresses no belief), at the time it
           became effective, contained any untrue statement of a material fact
           or omitted to state a material fact required to be stated therein or
           necessary to make the statements therein not misleading or that the
           Joint Proxy Statement (other than the financial statements and
           related notes, financial data, statistical data and supporting
           schedules included therein, and information relating to or supplied
           by UTI, as to which such counsel expresses no belief), at the time
           the S-4 Registration Statement became effective, at the time of
           mailing or at the time of the Stockholder Meetings, included any
           untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material
           fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light
           of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.

                                       A-35

             (viii) The shares of PEC Common Stock to be issued pursuant to this
        Agreement, and any shares of Surviving Corporation Common Stock issuable
        upon exercise of the Substituted Options or Substituted Warrants will
        be, when so issued, duly authorized, validly issued and outstanding,
        fully paid and nonassessable and have not been issued in violation of
        any preemptive right of any stockholder.

             (ix) The shares of PEC Common Stock included in the S-4
        Registration Statement and the shares of Surviving Corporation Common
        Stock issuable upon exercise of the Substituted Options and Substituted
        Warrants have been listed on the Nasdaq National Market subject to
        official notice of issuance.

        In rendering such opinion, counsel for PEC may rely as to matters of
        fact upon the representations of officers of PEC contained in any
        certificate delivered to such counsel and certificates of public
        officials. Such opinion shall be limited to the General Corporation Law
        of the State of Delaware and the laws of the United States of America
        and the State of Texas.

          (h) PEC Board of Directors.  PEC's Board of Directors shall have taken
     all necessary and appropriate actions to cause the number of directors
     comprising the full Board of Directors of PEC at the Effective Time to be
     increased by 4 and the vacancies thus created to be filled at the Effective
     Time by the election of 5 new directors, each of whom shall have been
     designated by UTI prior to the Effective Time.

     SECTION 6.3  Conditions to Obligations of PEC.  The obligations of PEC to
effect the Merger shall be subject to the fulfillment at or prior to the

     Effective Time as if made on and as of such date and each of the
     representations and warranties that is not so qualified shall be true in
     all material respects on and as of the date of this Agreement and (except
     to the extent such representations and warranties speak as of an earlier
     date) as of the Effective Time as if made on and as of such date, and PEC
     shall have received a certificate signed on behalf of UTI by appropriate
     officers of UTI to such effect.

          (c) Third-Party Consents.  All required authorizations, consents or

          (d) Tax Opinion of Baker & Hostetler LLP.  PEC shall have received the
     opinion of Baker & Hostetler LLP, counsel to the PEC, dated the Effective
     Time, to the effect that the Merger will be treated for federal income tax

     opinion of counsel from Fulbright & Jaworski L.L.P., counsel to UTI, dated
     the Effective Time, substantially to the effect that:

             (i) The incorporation, existence, and good standing of UTI are as
        stated in this Agreement; the authorized shares of UTI Common Stock are
        as stated in this Agreement; all outstanding shares of UTI Common Stock
        are duly and validly authorized and issued, fully paid and non-
                                       A-36

        assessable and have not been issued in violation of any preemptive right
        of stockholders. (ii) UTI has full corporate power and authority to
        execute, deliver and perform this Agreement and this Agreement has been
        duly authorized, executed and delivered by UTI, and (assuming the due
        and valid authorization, execution and delivery by PEC and Sub)
        constitutes the legal, valid and binding agreement of UTI enforceable
        against UTI in accordance with its terms, except to the extent
        enforceability may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization,
        moratorium, fraudulent transfer or other similar laws of general
        applicability relating to or affecting the enforcement of creditors'
        rights and by the effect of general principles of equity (regardless of
        whether enforceability is considered in a proceeding in equity or at
        law).

             (iii) The execution and performance by UTI of this Agreement will
        not violate the Restated Certificate of Incorporation, as amended, or
        Bylaws of UTI and will not violate, result in a breach of, or constitute
        a default under, any material lease, mortgage, contract, agreement,
        instrument, law, rule, regulation, judgment, order or decree known to
        such counsel to which UTI is a party or to which they or any of their
        properties or assets may be bound.

             (iv) To the knowledge of such counsel, there are no actions, suits
        or proceedings, pending or threatened against or affecting UTI, by any
        Governmental Entity which seek to restrain, prohibit or invalidate the
        transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

             (v) To the knowledge of such counsel, no consent, approval,
        authorization or order of any court or governmental agency or body which
        has not been obtained is required on behalf of UTI for consummation of
        the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

             (vi) (A) At the time the S-4 Registration Statement became
        effective, the Joint Proxy Statement (other than the financial
        statements and related notes, financial data, statistical data and
        supporting schedules included therein, and information relating to or
        supplied by PEC or UTI as to which such counsel expresses no opinion)
        complied as to form in all material respects with the requirements of
        the Exchange Act.

                (B) In the course of the preparation of the Joint Proxy
           Statement such counsel has considered the information set forth
           therein in light of the matters required to be set forth therein, and
           has participated in conferences with officers and representatives of
           UTI and PEC, including their respective counsel and independent
           public accountants, during the course of which the contents of the
           Joint Proxy Statement and related matters were discussed. Such
           counsel has not independently checked the accuracy or completeness
           of, or otherwise verified, and accordingly is not passing upon, and
           does not assume responsibility for, the accuracy, completeness or
           fairness of the statements contained in the Joint Proxy Statement;
           and such counsel has relied as to materiality, to a large extent,
           upon the judgment of officers and representatives of UTI and PEC.
           However, as a result of such consideration and participation, nothing
           has come to such counsel's attention which causes such counsel to
           believe that the Joint Proxy Statement (other than the financial
           statements and related notes, financial data, statistical data and
           supporting schedules included therein, and information relating to or
           supplied by or PEC, as to which such counsel expresses no belief), at
           the time it became effective, contained any untrue statement of a
           material fact or omitted to state a material fact required to be
           stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not
           misleading or that the Joint Proxy Statement (other than the
           financial statements and related notes, financial data, statistical
           data and supporting schedules included therein, and information
           relating to or supplied by PEC or Sub, as to which such counsel
           expresses no belief), at the time the S-4 Registration Statement
           became effective, at the time of mailing or at the time of the
           Stockholder Meetings, included any untrue statement of a material
           fact or omitted to state a material fact necessary in order to make
           the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which
           they were made, not misleading.

                                       A-37

     In rendering such opinion, counsel for UTI may rely as to matters of fact
upon the representations of officers of UTI contained in any certificate
delivered to such counsel and certificates of public officials.

in Section 8.1) shall become void and of no effect with no liability on the
party of any party hereto (or of any of its directors, officers, employees,

however, except as otherwise provided herein, no such termination shall relieve
any party hereto of any liability or damages resulting from any willful or
grossly negligent breach of this Agreement.

     (b) In the event that (i) a UTI Acquisition Proposal shall have been made
to UTI or any of its Subsidiaries or any of its stockholders or any Person shall

Acquisition Proposal with respect to UTI or any of its Subsidiaries and

then UTI shall promptly, but in no event

                                       A-39

later than two days after the date PEC makes a written request for payment, pay

case payable by wire transfer of same day funds.

7.5(b), (c), (d) and (e) are an integral part of the transactions contemplated

enter into this Agreement; accordingly, if UTI fails to promptly pay the amount
due pursuant to Section 7.5(b) or (e), or PEC fails to promptly pay the amount
due pursuant to Section 7.5(c) or (d) and, in order to obtain such payment, PEC
or UTI, as the case may be, commences a suit which results in a judgment against

hereto, by or pursuant to action taken by their respective Boards of Directors,
at any time before or after approval of the Merger by the stockholders of UTI or

other acts of the other parties hereto, (ii) waive any inaccuracies in the

which may legally be waived. Any agreement on the part of a party hereto to any
such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in an instrument in
writing signed on behalf of such party.

     SECTION 8.3  Interpretation.  When a reference is made in this Agreement to
a Section, such reference shall be to a Section of this Agreement unless
otherwise indicated, and the words "hereof," "herein" and "hereunder" and
similar terms refer to this Agreement as a whole and not to any particular
provision of this Agreement, unless the context otherwise requires. The  and headings

                                       A-41

contained in this Agreement are for reference purposes only and shall not affect

"include," "includes" or "including" are used in this Agreement, they shall be
deemed to be followed by the words "without limitation."

     SECTION 8.4  Counterparts.  This Agreement may be executed in counterparts,
all of which shall be considered one and the same agreement and shall become
effective when one or more counterparts have been signed by each of the parties
and delivered to the other parties.

     SECTION 8.5  Entire Agreement; No Third-Party Beneficiaries.  This
Agreement, (including any exhibits hereto) the PEC Disclosure Schedule, the UTI
Disclosure Schedule and the Confidentiality Agreement dated as of the date of
this Agreement between PEC and UTI, (a) constitutes the entire agreement and
supersedes all prior agreements and understandings, both written and oral, among
the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and (b) except for the

their respective successors and assigns.

     SECTION 8.8  Severability.  If any term or other provision of this

or public policy, all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement shall
nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as the economic or legal
substance of the transactions contemplated hereby are not affected in any manner
materially adverse to any party. Upon such determination that any term or other
provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the parties shall

fullest extent possible.

     SECTION 8.9  Enforcement of This Agreement.  The parties agree that
irreparable damage would occur in the event that any of the provisions of this

otherwise breached. It is accordingly agreed that the parties shall be entitled
to an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to
enforce specifically the terms and provisions hereof in any court of the United
States or any state having jurisdiction, this being in addition to any other
remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity.

Gentlemen:

     I have been advised that as of the date hereof I may be deemed to be an
"affiliate" of UTI Energy Corp., a Delaware corporation ("UTI"), as the term
"affiliate" is (i) defined for purposes of paragraphs (c) and (d) of Rule 145 of
the Rules and Regulations (the "Rules and Regulations") of the Securities and
Exchange Commission (the "Commission") under the Securities Act of 1933, as
amended (together with the rules and regulations promulgated hereunder, the
"Securities Act"), and/or (ii) used in and for purposes of Accounting Series,
Releases 130 and 135, as amended, of the Commission. Pursuant to the terms of
the Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of February 4, 2001(the "Merger
Agreement"). UTI will be merged with and into Patterson Energy, Inc., a Delaware
corporation ("PEC"), in consideration of Surviving Corporation Common Stock (as
hereinafter defined), with PEC as the surviving corporation (the "Surviving
Corporation").

     As used herein, "UTI Common Stock" means the Common Stock, par value $0.001
per share, of UTI and "Surviving Corporation Common Stock" means the Common
Stock, par value $0.01 per share, of PEC.

     I represent, warrant, and covenant to PEC that in the event I receive any
Surviving Corporation Common Stock as a result of the Merger:

          A. I shall not make any sale, transfer or other disposition of any
     Surviving Corporation Common Stock acquired by me in the Merger in
     violation of the Securities Act.

          B. I have carefully read this letter and the Merger Agreement and
     discussed their requirements and other applicable limitations upon my
     ability to sell, transfer, or otherwise dispose of Surviving Corporation
     Common Stock, to the extent I felt necessary, with my counsel or counsel
     for Surviving Corporation.

          C. I have been advised that the issuance of Surviving Corporation
     Common Stock to me pursuant to the Merger has been or will be registered
     with the Commission under the Securities Act on a Registration Statement on
     Form S-4. However, I have also been advised that, because at the time the
     Merger will be submitted for a vote of the shareholders of UTI, I may be
     deemed to be an affiliate of UTI, the distribution by me of any Surviving
     Corporation Common Stock acquired by me in the Merger will not be
     registered under the Securities Act and that I may not sell, transfer, or
     otherwise dispose of any Surviving Corporation Common Stock acquired by me
     in the Merger unless (i) such sale, transfer, or other disposition has been
     registered under the Securities Act, (ii) such sale, transfer, or other
     disposition is made in conformity with the volume and other limitations of
     Rule 145 promulgated by the Commission under the Securities Act, or (iii)
     in the opinion of counsel reasonably acceptable to Surviving Corporation
     such sale, transfer, or other disposition is otherwise exempt from
     registration under the Securities Act.

          D. I understand that Surviving Corporation is under no obligation to
     register under the Securities Act the sale, transfer, or other disposition
     by me or on my behalf of any Surviving Corporation Common Stock acquired by
     me in the Merger or to take any other action necessary in order to make an
     exemption from such registration available.

          E. I also understand that stop transfer instructions will be given to
     Surviving Corporation's transfer agent with respect to Surviving
     Corporation Common Stock and that there will be placed on the certificates
     for any Surviving Corporation Common Stock acquired by me in the Merger, or
     any substitutions therefore, a legend stating in substance:

                "The shares represented by this certificate were
           issued in a transaction to which Rule 145 promulgated
           under the Securities Act of 1933 applies. The shares
           represented by this certificate may only be transferred in
           accordance with the terms of an agreement dated as of
           February 4, 2001, between the registered holder hereof and
           the issuer of this certificate, a copy of which
                                   A-EXH I(A)-1

           agreement will be mailed to the holder hereof without
           charge within five days after receipt of written request
           therefore."

          F. I also understand that unless the transfer by me of my Surviving
     Corporation Common Stock has been registered under the Securities Act or is
     a sale made in conformity with the provisions of Rule 145, Surviving
     Corporation reserves the right to put the following legend on the
     certificates issued to my transferred:

                "The shares represented by this certificate have not
           been registered under the Securities Act of 1933 and were
           acquired from a person who received such shares in a
           transaction to which Rule 145 promulgated under the
           Securities Act of 1933 applies. The shares may not be
           sold, pledged, or otherwise transferred except in
           accordance with an exemption from the registration
           requirements of the Securities Act of 1933."

     It is understood and agreed that the legends set forth in paragraph E and F
above shall be removed by the delivery of substitute certificates without such
legend if the undersigned shall have delivered to Surviving Corporation a copy
of a letter from the staff of the Commission, or an opinion of counsel in form
and substance reasonably satisfactory to Surviving Corporation, to the effect
that such legend is not required for purposes of the Securities Act.

     I understand that (a) Surviving Corporation will supply me with any
information necessary to enable me to make routine sales of any Surviving
Corporation Common Stock acquired by me in the Merger as may be permitted, by
and in accordance with, the provisions of Rule 144 under the Securities Act or
any similar rule of the Commission hereafter applicable, and (b) Surviving
Corporation will comply with all requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of
1934 rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, (the "Exchange Act") with
respect to the filing by Surviving Corporation of annual, periodic and other
reports on a timely basis in a manner sufficient to allow sales of any such
Surviving Corporation Common Stock by me during the three year period following
the Effective Time (as defined in the Merger Agreement) if such sales are
otherwise permitted by law or regulation. Upon my written request, Surviving
Corporation shall furnish me with a written statement representing that it has
complied with the reporting requirements enumerated in Rule 144(c)(1), or if
Surviving Corporation is not then subject to Section 13 or 15(d) of the Exchange
Act, that it has made publicly available the information concerning Surviving
Corporation required by Rule 144(c)(2).

                                   A-EXH I(A)-2

     I further represent to and covenant with PEC and the Surviving Corporation
that I will not, within the 30 days prior to the Effective Time (as defined in
the Agreement), sell, transfer, or otherwise dispose of any shares PEC Common
Stock and that I will not sell, transfer, or otherwise dispose of any shares of
Surviving Corporation Common Stock (whether or not acquired by me in the Merger)
until after such time as results covering at least 30 days of post-closing
combined operations have been published by PEC and the Surviving Corporation, in
the form of a quarterly earnings report, an effective registration statement
filed with the Commission, a report to the Commission on Form 10-K, 10-Q, or
8-K, or any other public filing or announcement which includes the combined
results of operations. Furthermore, I understand that Surviving Corporation will
give stop transfer instructions to its transfer agent in order to prevent the
breach of the representations, warranties, and covenants made by me in this
paragraph. I also understand that the Merger is intended to be treated for
accounting purposes as a "pooling of interests," and I agree that, PEC advises
me in writing that additional restrictions apply to my ability to sell,
transfer, or otherwise dispose of Surviving Corporation Common Stock in order to
be entitled to use the pooling of interest accounting method, I will abide by
such restrictions.

                                            Very truly yours,

Gentlemen:

     I have been advised that as of the date hereof I may be deemed to be an
"affiliate" of Patterson Energy, Inc., Delaware corporation ("PEC"), as the term
"affiliate" is (i) defined for purposes of paragraphs (c) and (d) of Rule 145 of
the Rules and Regulations (the "Rules and Regulations") of the Securities and
Exchange Commission (the "Commission") under the Securities Act of 1933, as
amended (together with the rules and regulations promulgated hereunder, the
"Securities Act"), and/or (ii) used in and for purposes of Accounting Series,
Releases 130 and 135, as amended, of the Commission. Pursuant to the terms of
the Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of February 4, 2001 (the "Merger
Agreement"), UTI Energy Corp. ("UTI"), a Delaware corporation, will be merged
(the "Merger") with and into Patterson Energy, Inc., a Delaware corporation
("PEC"), in consideration of Surviving Corporation Common Stock (as hereinafter
defined) with PEC as the Surviving Corporation (the "Surviving Corporation").

     As used herein, "Surviving Corporation Common Stock" means the Common
Stock, par value $0.01 per share, of Surviving Corporation.

     I represent, warrant, and covenant to PEC that in the event I receive any
Surviving Corporation Common Stock as a result of the Merger:

          A. I shall not make any sale, transfer or other disposition of any
     Surviving Corporation Common Stock acquired by me in the Merger in
     violation of the Securities Act.

          B. I have carefully read this letter and the Merger Agreement and
     discussed their requirements and other applicable limitations upon my
     ability to sell, transfer, or otherwise dispose of Surviving Corporation
     Common Stock, to the extent I felt necessary, with my counsel or counsel
     for PEC.

          C. I have been advised that the issuance of Surviving Corporation
     Common Stock to me pursuant to the Merger has been or will be registered
     with the Commission under the Securities Act on a Registration Statement on
     Form S-4. However, I have also been advised that, because at the time the
     Merger will be submitted for a vote of the shareholders of UTI, I may be
     deemed to be an affiliate of PEC, the distribution by me of any Surviving
     Corporation Common Stock acquired by me in the Merger will not be
     registered under the Securities Act and that I may not sell, transfer, or
     otherwise dispose of any Surviving Corporation Common Stock acquired by me
     in the Merger unless (i) such sale, transfer, or other disposition has been
     registered under the Securities Act, (ii) such sale, transfer, or other
     disposition is made in conformity with the volume and other limitations of
     Rule 145 promulgated by the Commission under the Securities Act, or (iii)
     in the opinion of counsel reasonably acceptable to Surviving Corporation
     such sale, transfer, or other disposition is otherwise exempt from
     registration under the Securities Act.

          D. I understand that Surviving Corporation is under no obligation to
     register under the Securities Act the sale, transfer, or other disposition
     by me or on my behalf of any Surviving Corporation Common Stock acquired by
     me in the Merger or to take any other action necessary in order to make an
     exemption from such registration available.

          E. I also understand that stop transfer instructions will be given to
     Surviving Corporation's transfer agent with respect to Surviving
     Corporation Common Stock and that there will be placed on the certificates
     for any Surviving Corporation Common Stock acquired by me in the Merger, or
     any substitutions therefore, a legend stating in substance:

           "The shares represented by this certificate were issued in
           a transaction to which Rule 145 promulgated under the
           Securities Act of 1933 applies. The shares represented by
           this certificate may only be transferred in accordance
           with the terms of an agreement dated as of February 4,
           2001, between the registered holder hereof and the issuer
           of this certificate, a copy of which

                                    EXH I(B)-1

           agreement will be mailed to the holder hereof without
           charge within five days after receipt of written request
           therefore."

          F. I also understand that unless the transfer by me of my Surviving
     Corporation Common Stock has been registered under the Securities Act or is
     a sale made in conformity with the provisions of Rule 145, PEC reserves the
     right to put the following legend on the certificates issued to my
     transferred:

                "The shares represented by this certificate have not
           been registered under the Securities Act of 1933 and were
           acquired from a person who received such shares in a
           transaction to which Rule 145 promulgated under the
           Securities Act of 1933 applies. The shares may not be
           sold, pledged, or otherwise transferred except in
           accordance with an exemption from the registration
           requirements of the Securities Act of 1933."

     It is understood and agreed that the legends set forth in paragraphs E and
F above shall be removed by the delivery of substitute certificates without such
legend if the undersigned shall have delivered to Surviving Corporation a copy
of a letter from the staff of the Commission, or an opinion of counsel in form
and substance reasonably satisfactory to Surviving Corporation, to the effect
that such legend is not required for purposes of the Securities Act.

     I understand that (a) Surviving Corporation will supply me with any

Corporation is not then subject to Section 13 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act, that
it has made publicly available the information concerning PEC required by Rule
144(c)(2).

                                    EXH I(B)-2

     I further represent to and covenant with PEC and the Surviving Corporation
that I will not, within the 30 days prior to the Effective Time (as defined in
the Agreement), sell, transfer, or otherwise dispose of any shares of PEC Common
Stock and that I will not sell, transfer, or otherwise dispose of any shares of
Surviving Corporation Common Stock (whether or not acquired by me in the Merger)
until after such time as results covering at least 30 days of post-closing
combined operations have been published by Surviving Corporation, in the form of
a quarterly earnings report, an effective registration statement filed with the
Commission, a report to the Commission on Form 10-K, 10-Q, or 8-K, or any other

                             PATTERSON ENERGY, INC.

               UTI ENERGY CORP. STOCK OPTION ASSUMPTION AGREEMENT

     AGREEMENT, dated as of             , 2001 (this "Agreement"), between
Patterson Energy, Inc., a Delaware corporation ("PEI"), and           , an
individual ("Participant").

                                   RECITALS:

     UTI Energy Corp.("UTI") and Participant have entered into one or more stock
option agreements ("UTI Option Agreement") relating to options ("Options")
granted to Participant under the UTI Stock Plans (as defined in the Merger
Agreement hereinafter defined) pursuant to which Participant is presently
entitled to purchase up to      shares of Common Stock of UTI as shown in the
schedule attached to this Agreement.

     UTI and PEI , have entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger dated as of
February   , 2001 (the "Merger Agreement"), pursuant to which UTI will merge
with and into PEI in consideration to the UTI stockholders of shares of PEI
Common Stock (the "Merger"). Pursuant to Section 5.7 of the Merger Agreement, at
the Effective Time (as defined in the Merger Agreement) of the Merger, all
options to acquire shares of UTI Common Stock outstanding immediately before the
Effective Time shall be assumed by PEI.

     By this Agreement, the parties desire to confirm the assumption
contemplated by Section 5.7 of the Merger Agreement as it relates to Options
granted under the UTI Stock Plans.

                                   AGREEMENT

     PEI and Participant agree as follows:

     1. Assumption of Option.  By this Agreement, PEI assumes, and Participant
agrees to the assumption by PEI of, all of the obligations of UTI to Participant
under the UTI Option Agreement except that:

          (a) Each reference therein to "shares" shall mean shares of PEI Common
     Stock, $0.01 par value per share;

          (b) Each reference therein to a number of shares shall be a reference
     to a number of shares determined by multiplying such number by 1.0 (the
     "Exchange Ratio");

          (c) Each reference therein to an exercise price per share shall be a
     reference to a price determined by dividing the exchange price in the UTI
     Option Agreement by the Exchange Ratio; and

          (d) Each reference therein to the Committee shall mean the
     Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors of PEI.

     (The results of the computations in (b) and (c) above as applied to the
Participant's Options presently outstanding under the UTI Stock Plans appear in
the Schedule to this Agreement.)

     2. UTI Stock Plans.  By this Agreement, PEI assumes the UTI Stock Plans
subject to the provisions of Section 1 above.

     3. Recognition of Vesting, Exercises and Lapses.  PEI acknowledges that
upon assumption the Options will have the same terms and conditions as were
applicable under the Options after giving effect to any existing provision in
such Options or applicable UTI Stock Plans that provides for the automatic
acceleration of vesting upon consummation of the Merger and a change in control
of UTI, and Participant acknowledges that any lapses or exercises of Options
thereunder to date shall be recognized.
                                    A-EXH II-1

     4. Registration.  Promptly following the date hereof, PEI will file a
Registration Statement on Form S-8 under the Securities Act of 1933 with the
Securities and Exchange Commission covering the Options being assumed hereunder
by PEI and agrees to thereafter file a "reoffer prospectus" within the meaning
of Instruction C-1 to Form S-8 with a Post-Effective Amendment to such

February 4, 2001

Board of Directors
UTI Energy Corp.
16800 Greenspoint Park, Suite 225N
Houston, Texas 77060

Members of the Board:

     We understand that UTI Energy Corp. (the "Company") and Patterson Energy,
Inc. ("Patterson") are considering entering into a transaction pursuant to
which, among other things, (i) the Company will merge with and into Patterson,
with Patterson being the surviving corporation (the "Merger"); and (ii) upon the
effectiveness of the Merger, each share of common stock of the Company issued
and outstanding prior to the Merger will be converted into the right to receive
one share of the common stock of Patterson (the "Exchange Ratio"). The terms and
conditions of the Merger are set forth in more detail in an Agreement and Plan
of Merger to be entered into between the Company and Patterson (the
"Agreement").

     We have been requested by the Board of Directors of the Company to render
our opinion with respect to the fairness, from a financial point of view, to the
Company's stockholders of the Exchange Ratio to be offered to such stockholders
in the Merger. We have not been requested to opine as to, and our opinion does
not in any manner address, the Company's underlying business decision to proceed
with or effect the Merger. In addition, in arriving at our opinion, at the
direction of the Company, we have had limited opportunity to conduct due
diligence on the Company and Patterson and, as further described below, our
opinion therefore was necessarily based primarily upon publicly available
information.

     In arriving at our opinion, we reviewed and analyzed: (1) the Agreement and
the specific terms of the Merger (including with respect to corporate governance
of the combined company); (2) publicly available information concerning the
Company and Patterson that we believe to be relevant to our analysis, including
Annual Reports on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 1999 and
Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2000; (3) a
trading history of the common stock of each of the Company and Patterson from
February 2, 2000 to the present and a comparison of these trading histories with
each other and with those of other companies that we deemed relevant; (4) a
comparison of the historical financial results and present financial condition
of each of the Company and Patterson with each other and with those of other
companies that we deemed relevant; (5) a comparison of the financial terms of
the Merger with the financial terms of certain other transactions that we deemed
relevant; (6) estimates of third party research analysts with respect to the
future financial performance of each of the Company and Patterson; and (7) the
relative contributions of the Company and Patterson to the historical and future
financial performance of the combined company on a pro forma basis. In addition,
we have had discussions with the management of each of the Company and Patterson
concerning their respective businesses, operations, assets, financial condition
and prospects and concerning the strategic benefits expected to result from the
Merger and have undertaken such other studies, analyses and investigations as we
deemed appropriate.

     In arriving at our opinion, we have assumed and relied upon the accuracy
and completeness of the financial and other information used by us without
assuming any responsibility for independent verification of such information and
have further relied upon the assurances of management of each of the Company and
Patterson that they are not aware of any facts or circumstances that would make
such information inaccurate or misleading. In arriving at our opinion, we did
not review financial projections of the Company or Patterson prepared by
management of the Company or Patterson. Based upon advice of the Company, we
have assumed that the published estimates of third party research analysts are a
reasonable

                                       B-1

basis upon which to evaluate the future financial performance of each of the
Company and Patterson on a comparative basis. In arriving at our opinion, we
have not conducted a physical inspection of the properties and facilities of the
Company and have not made or obtained any evaluations or appraisals of the
assets or liabilities of the Company. Upon advice of the Company and its legal
and accounting advisors, we have assumed that the Merger will qualify (i) for
pooling-of-interests accounting treatment and (ii) as a reorganization within
the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended,
and therefore as a tax-free transaction to the stockholders of the Company. Our
opinion necessarily is based upon market, economic and other conditions as they
exist on, and can be evaluated as of, the date of this letter.

     Based upon and subject to the foregoing, we are of the opinion as of the
date hereof that, from a financial point of view, the Exchange Ratio to be
offered to the stockholders of the Company in the Merger is fair to such
stockholders.

     The Company has agreed to indemnify us for certain liabilities that may
arise out of the rendering of this opinion. We also have performed various
investment banking services for the Company in the past and have received
customary fees for such services. In the ordinary course of our business, we
actively trade in the securities of the Company and Patterson for our own
account and for the accounts of our customers and, accordingly, may at any time
hold a long or short position in such securities.

     This opinion is for the use and benefit of the Board of Directors of the
Company and is rendered to the Board of Directors in connection with its
consideration of the Merger. This opinion is not intended to be and does not
constitute a recommendation to any stockholder of the Company as to how such
stockholder should vote with respect to the Merger.

                                            Very truly yours,

                                            LEHMAN BROTHERS

[MERRILL LYNCH LOGO]

February 4, 2001

Board of Directors
Patterson Energy, Inc.
4510 Lamesa Highway
Snyder, Texas 79550

Members of the Board of Directors:

     UTI Energy Corp. (the "Company") and Patterson Energy, Inc. (the
"Acquiror") propose to enter into an Agreement and Plan of Merger, substantially
in the form of the draft dated February 4, 2001 (the "Agreement") pursuant to
which the Company will be merged with the Acquiror in a merger (the "Merger").
As a result of the Merger, each issued and outstanding share of the Company's
common stock, par value $0.001 per share, (the "Company Shares") will be
converted into the right to receive 1.000 shares (the "Exchange Ratio") of the
common stock of the Acquiror, par value $0.01 per share (the "Acquiror Shares").
The terms and conditions of the Merger are more fully set forth in the
Agreement.

     You have asked us whether, in our opinion, the Exchange Ratio is fair from
a financial point of view to the Acquiror.

     In arriving at the opinion set forth below, we have, among other things:

          (1) Reviewed certain publicly available business and financial
     information relating to the Company and the Acquiror that we deemed to be
     relevant including (a) Annual Reports on Form 10-K and related audited
     financial statements for the three years ended Dec. 31, 1999 and (b)
     Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q and related unaudited financial statements
     for the quarterly periods ending March 31, 2000, June 30, 2000 and
     September 30, 2000;

          (2) Reviewed certain information, including financial forecasts,
     relating to the business, earnings, cash flow, assets, liabilities and
     prospects of the Company, as well as the amount of the cost savings and
     related expenses and synergies expected to result from the merger (the
     "Expected Synergies") furnished to us by the Acquiror;

          (3) Conducted discussions with members of senior management of the
     Company and the Acquiror concerning the matters described in clauses 1 and
     2 above, as well as their respective businesses and prospects before and
     after giving effect to the Merger;

          (4) Reviewed the market prices and valuation multiples for the Company
     Shares and the Acquiror Shares and compared them with those of certain
     publicly traded companies that we deemed to be relevant;

          (5) Reviewed the results of operations of the Company and the Acquiror
     and compared them with those of certain publicly traded companies that we
     deemed to be relevant;

          (6) Compared the proposed financial terms of the Merger with the
     financial terms of certain other transactions which we deemed to be
     relevant;

          (7) Reviewed the potential pro forma impact of the Merger on the
     Acquiror;

          (8) Reviewed a draft dated February 4, 2001 of the Agreement; and

                                       C-1

[MERRILL LYNCH LOGO]

          (9) Reviewed such other financial studies and analyses and took into
     account such other matters as we deemed necessary, including our assessment
     of general economic, market and monetary conditions.

     In preparing our opinion, we have assumed and relied on the accuracy and
completeness of all information supplied or otherwise made available to us,
discussed with or reviewed by or for us, or publicly available, and we have not
assumed any responsibility for independently verifying such information or
undertaken an independent evaluation or appraisal of any of the assets or
liabilities of the Company or been furnished with any such evaluation or
appraisal. In addition, we have not assumed any obligation to conduct any
physical inspection of the properties or facilities of the Company. With respect
to the financial forecast information and the Expected Synergies furnished to or
discussed with us by the Company or the Acquiror, we have assumed that they have
been reasonably prepared and reflect the best currently available estimates and
judgement of the Company's or the Acquiror's managements as to the expected
future financial performance of the Company or the Acquiror, as the case may be,
and the Expected Synergies. We have made no independent investigation of any
legal matters and accounting advice given to such parties and their respective
boards of directors, including, without limitation, advice as to the accounting
and tax consequences of the Merger. We have also assumed that the final form of
the Agreement will be substantially similar to the February 4 draft reviewed by
us.

     Our opinion is necessarily based upon market, economic and other conditions
as they exist and can be evaluated on, and on the information made available to
us as of, the date hereof. We have assumed that in the course of obtaining the
necessary regulatory or other consents or approvals (contractual or otherwise)
for the Merger, no restrictions, including any divestiture requirements or
amendments or modifications, will be imposed that will have a material adverse
effect on the contemplated benefits of the Merger.

     We are acting as financial advisor to the Acquiror in connection with the
Merger and will receive a fee from the Acquiror for our services. In addition,
the Acquiror has agreed to indemnify us for certain liabilities arising out of
our engagement. In addition, in the ordinary course of our business, we may
actively trade the securities of the Acquiror for our own account and for the
accounts of customers and, accordingly, may at any time hold a long or short
position in such securities.

     This opinion is for the use and benefit of the Board of Directors of the
Acquiror. Our opinion does not address the merits of the underlying decision by
the Acquiror to engage in the Merger and does not constitute a recommendation to
any shareholder of the Acquiror as to how such shareholder should vote on the
proposed Merger or any matter related thereto. We are not expressing any opinion
herein as to the prices at which the Acquiror Shares will trade following the
announcement or consummation of the Merger.

     On the basis of and subject to the foregoing, we are of the opinion that,
as of the date hereof, the Exchange Ratio is fair from a financial point of view
to the Acquiror and its shareholders.

                                            Very truly yours,

                                            MERRILL LYNCH, PIERCE, FENNER &

The Board of Directors shall fix the terms of each such series by resolution or
resolutions adopted at any time prior to the issuance of the shares thereof, and
the terms of each such series may, subject only to restrictions, if any, imposed
by this Certificate of Incorporation or by applicable law, vary from the terms
of other series to the extent determined by the Board of Directors from time to
time and provided in the resolution or resolutions fixing the terms of the
respective series of the Preferred Stock.

     1.2  Status of Certain Shares.  Shares of any series of the Preferred
Stock, whether provided for herein or by resolution or resolutions of the Board
of Directors, which have been redeemed (whether through the operation of a
sinking fund or otherwise) or which, if convertible or exchangeable, have been
converted into or exchanged for shares of stock of any other class or classes,
or which have been purchased or otherwise acquired by the Corporation, shall
have the status of authorized and unissued shares of the Preferred Stock of the
same series and may be reissued as a part of the series of which they were
originally a part or may be reclassified and reissued as part of a new series of
the Preferred Stock to be created by resolution or resolutions of the Board of
Directors or as a part of any other series of the Preferred Stock, all subject
to the conditions or restrictions on issuance set forth herein or in the
resolution or resolutions adopted by the Board of Directors providing for the
issue of any series of the Preferred Stock.

     SECTION 2. COMMON STOCK

     2.1  Issuance, Consideration, and Terms.  Any unissued shares of the Common
Stock may be issued from time to time for such consideration, having a value of
not less than the par value thereof, as may be fixed from time to time by the
Board of Directors. Any treasury shares may be disposed of for such
consideration as may be determined from time to time by the Board of Directors.
The Common Stock shall be subject to the express terms of the Preferred Stock
and any series thereof. Each share of Common Stock shall be of equal rank and
shall be identical to every other share of Common Stock. Holders of Common Stock
shall have such rights as are provided herein and by law.

     2.2  Voting Rights.  Except as expressly required by law or as provided in
or fixed and determined pursuant to Section 1 of this Article FOURTH, the entire
voting power and all voting rights shall be vested exclusively in the Common
Stock. Each holder of shares of Common Stock shall be entitled to one (1) vote
for each share standing in such holder's name on the books of the Corporation.

                                       D-2

     2.3  Dividends.  Subject to Section 1 of this Article FOURTH, the holders
of Common Stock shall be entitled to receive, and shall share equally share for
share, when and as declared by the Board of Directors, out of the assets of the
Corporation which are by law available therefor, dividends or distributions
payable in cash, in property, or in securities of the Corporation.

     THIRD: The Amendment does not provide for the exchange, reclassification or
cancellation of issued shares.

     FOURTH: The Amendment does not effect a change in the amount of stated
capital.

                            AUDIT COMMITTEE CHARTER

                                    PURPOSE

     The primary purpose of the Audit Committee (the "Committee") is to assist
the Board of Directors (the "Board") in fulfilling its responsibility to oversee
management's conduct of the Company's financial reporting process, including
review of the financial reports and other financial information provided by the
Company to the public and governmental and regulatory bodies, the Company's
systems of internal accounting, the Company's financial controls, and the annual
independent audit of the Company's financial statement.

     In discharging its role, the Committee is empowered to investigate any
matter brought to its attention, with full access to all books, records,
facilities and personnel to the Company and the power to retain outside counsel,
auditors or other experts for this purpose. The Board and the Committee are in
place to represent the Company's shareholders; and, accordingly, the independent
auditors are ultimately accountable to the Board through the Committee.

                                   MEMBERSHIP

     The Committee will be comprised of not less than three members of the
Board, and the Committee's composition will meet the requirements of the Audit
Committee Policy of the American Stock Exchange. Accordingly, on or before June
2001, members will be independent outside directors who, in the judgment of the
Board, are financially literate or who can become financially literate within a
reasonable period of time after appointment to the Committee and at least one
member of the Committee will have accounting or related financial management
expertise, as the Board interprets such qualification in its business judgment.

                              KEY RESPONSIBILITIES

     The Committee's job is one of review and it recognizes that the Company's
management is responsible for preparing the Company's financial statements and
that the independent auditors are responsible for auditing those financial
statements. Additionally, the Committee recognizes that financial management and
the independent auditors have more time, knowledge, and detailed information
concerning the Company than do Committee members. Consequently, in performing
its functions, the Committee is not providing any expert or special assurance as
to the Company's financial statements or any professional certification as to
the independent auditors' work.

     The following functions will be the common recurring activities of the
Committee. These functions are set forth as a guide with the understanding that
the Committee may diverge from this guide as appropriate given the
circumstances.

     - The Committee will review with management and the independent auditors
       the audited financial statements to be included in the Company's Annual
       Report on Form 10-K and review and consider with the independent auditors
       the matters remaining to be discussed by Statement of Auditing Standards
       No. 61, as it may be modified or supplemented.

     - As a whole or through the Committee chair, the Committee will review with
       the independent auditors the Company's interim financial results.

     - The Committee will discuss with management and independent auditors the
       quality and adequacy of the Company's internal controls.

                                       F-1

     - The Committee shall:

      - Obtain from the independent auditors annually, a formal written
        statement delineating all relationships between the auditors and the
        Company consistent with Independence Standards Board Number 1;

      - Discuss with the independent auditors any such disclosed relationships
        and their impact on the auditors' objectivity and independence; and

      - Recommend that the Board take appropriate action in response to the
        independent auditors' report to satisfy itself of the auditors'
        independence.

     - The Committee and the Board will have the ultimate authority and
       responsibility to select, evaluate and where appropriate, replace the
       independent auditors.

     While the Committee has the responsibilities and powers set forth in this
Charter, it is not the duty of the Committee to plan or conduct audits or to
determine that the Company's financial statements are complete and accurate and
are in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. This is the
responsibility of management and the independent auditors. Nor is it the duty of
the Committee to conduct investigations, to resolve disagreements, if any,
between management and the independent auditors or to assure compliance with
laws and regulations and the Company's policies.

                                       F-2

                                                                         ANNEX G

                             PATTERSON ENERGY, INC.

                                AUDIT COMMITTEE
                                     OF THE
                               BOARD OF DIRECTORS

                                    CHARTER

PURPOSE

     The Audit Committee shall provide assistance to the corporate directors in
fulfilling their responsibility to the shareholders, potential shareholders, and
investment community relating to corporate accounting, reporting practices of
the Corporation, and the quality and integrity of the financial reports of the
Corporation. The Audit Committee's primary duties and responsibilities are to:

     - Oversee that management has maintained the reliability and integrity of
       the accounting policies and financial reporting and disclosure practices
       of the Corporation.

     - Oversee that management has established and maintained processes to
       assure that an adequate system of internal control is functioning within
       the Corporation.

     - Oversee that management has established and maintained processes to
       assure compliance by the Corporation with all applicable laws,
       regulations and corporate policy.

     The Audit Committee will fulfill these responsibilities primarily by
carrying out the activities enumerated in Section IV of this Charter.

COMPOSITION

     The Audit Committee shall be comprised of three or more directors as
determined by the Board, each of whom shall be independent directors, and free
from any relationship that, in the opinion of the Board, would interfere with
the exercise of his or her independent judgment as a member of the Audit
Committee. All members of the Audit Committee shall have a working familiarity
with basic finance and accounting practices, and at least one member of the
Audit Committee shall have accounting or related financial management expertise.
Audit Committee members may enhance their familiarity with finance and
accounting by participating in educational programs conducted by the Corporation
or an outside consultant.

     The members of the Audit Committee shall be elected by the Board at the
annual organizational meeting of the Board or until their successors shall be
duly elected and qualified. Unless a Chairperson is elected by the full Board,
the members of the Audit Committee may designate a Chairperson by majority vote
of the full Audit Committee membership.

MEETINGS

     The Audit Committee shall meet at least four times annually, or more
frequently as circumstances dictate. As part of its job to foster open
communication, the Audit Committee should meet at least annually with
management, the director of the internal auditing department and the independent
accountants separately to discuss any matters that the Audit Committee or each
of these groups believes should be discussed privately. In addition, the Audit
Committee or at least its Chairperson should meet with the independent
accountants and management quarterly to review the Corporation's financials
consistent with Section IV.4 below.

                                       G-1

RESPONSIBILITIES AND DUTIES

     To fulfill its responsibilities and duties the Audit Committee shall:

  Documents/Reports Review

     1.  Review and reassess, at least annually, the adequacy of this Charter.
         Make recommendations to the Board, as conditions dictate, to update
         this Charter.

     2.  Review with management and the independent accountants the
         Corporation's annual financial statements, including a discussion with
         the independent accountants of the matters required to be discussed by
         Statement of Auditing Standards No. 61 ("SAS No. 61").

     3.  Review with management and the independent accountants the 10-Q prior
         to its filing or prior to the release of earnings, including a
         discussion with the independent accountants of the matters to be
         discussed by SAS No. 61. The Chairperson of the Audit Committee may
         represent the entire Audit Committee for purposes of this review.

  INDEPENDENT ACCOUNTANTS

     4.  Review the performance of the independent accountants and make
         recommendations to the Board regarding the appointment or termination
         of the independent accountants. The Audit Committee and the Board have
         the ultimate authority and responsibility to select, evaluate and,
         where appropriate, replace the outside auditor. The independent
         accountants are ultimately accountable to the Audit Committee and the
         entire Board for such accountants' review of the financial statements
         and controls of the Corporation. On an annual basis, the Audit
         Committee should review and discuss with the accountants all
         significant relationships the accountants have with the Corporation to
         determine the accountants' independence.

     5.  Oversee independence of the accountants by:

        -  receiving from the accountants, on a periodic basis, a formal written
           statement delineating all relationships between the accountants and
           the Corporation consistent with Independence Standards Board Standard
           1 ("ISB No. 1");

        -  reviewing, and actively discussing with the Board, if necessary, and
           the accountants, on a periodic basis, any disclosed relationships or
           services between the accountants and the Corporation or any other
           disclosed relationships or services that may impact the objectivity
           and independence of the accountants; and

        -  recommending, if necessary, that the Board take certain action to
           satisfy itself of the auditor's independence.

     6.  Based on the review and discussions referred to in section IV.2 and
         IV.5, the Audit Committee shall determine whether to recommend to the
         Board that the Corporation's audited financial statements be included
         in the Corporation's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the last fiscal
         year for filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

  FINANCIAL REPORTING PROCESS

     7.  In conjunction with the independent accountants and the internal
         auditors, review the integrity of the Corporation's financial reporting
         processes, both internal and external.

     8.  Consider and approve, if appropriate, major changes to the
         Corporation's auditing and accounting principles and practices as
         suggested by the independent accountants, management, or the internal
         auditing department.

     9.  Establish regular systems of reporting to the Audit Committee by each
         of management, the independent accountants and the internal auditors
         regarding any significant judgments made in
                                       G-2

         management's preparation of the financial statements and any
         significant difficulties encountered during the course of the review or
         audit, including any restrictions on the scope of the work or access to
         required information.

     10. Review any significant disagreement among management and the
         independent accountants or the internal auditing department in
         connection with the preparation of the financial statements.

  LEGAL COMPLIANCE/GENERAL

     11. Review with the Corporation's counsel, any legal matter that could have
         a significant impact on the Corporation's financial statements.

     12. Report through its Chairperson to the Board following meetings of the
         Audit Committee.

     13. Maintain minutes or other records of meetings and activities of the
         Audit Committee.

     While the Audit Committee has the responsibilities and powers set forth in
this Charter, it is not the duty of the Audit Committee to plan or conduct
audits or to determine that the Company's financial statements are complete and
accurate and are in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
This is the responsibility of management and the independent auditor. Nor is it
the duty of the Audit Committee to conduct investigations, to resolve
disagreements, if any, between management and the independent auditor.

 TO THEM IN THE JOINT PROXY STATEMENT/PROSPECTUS CONTAINED IN THIS REGISTRATION
                                   STATEMENT)

ITEM 20. INDEMNIFICATION OF DIRECTORS AND OFFICERS

     The Delaware General Corporate Law ("DGCL") provides for indemnification by
a corporation of costs incurred by directors, employees and agent in connection
with an action suit or proceeding brought by reason of their position as a
director, employee or agent. The person indemnified must have acted in good
faith and in a manner he reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best
interests of the corporation. The DGCL provides that a corporation may advance
payment of expenses. The DGCL further provides that the indemnification and
advancement of expenses provisions of the DGCL will not be deemed exclusive of
any other rights to which these indemnifications or advancements of expenses may
be entitled under bylaw, agreement, vote of stockholders or disinterested
directors or otherwise, both as to action under official capacity and as to
action in another capacity when holding such office.

     In addition to the general indemnification section, Delaware law provides
further protection for directors under Section 102(b)(7) of the DGCL. This
section was enacted in June 1986 and allows a Delaware corporation to include in
its certificate of incorporation a provision that eliminates and limits certain
personal liability of a director for monetary damages for certain breaches of
the director's fiduciary duty of care, provided that any such provision does not
(in the words of the statute) do any of the following:
        "eliminate or limit the liability of a director (i) for any
        breach of the director's duty of loyalty to the corporation or
        its stockholders, (ii) for acts or omissions not in good faith
        or which involve intentional misconduct or a knowing violation
        of law, (iii) under Section 174 of this Title dealing with
        willful or negligent violation of the statutory provision
        concerning dividends and stock purchases and redemptions, or
        (iv) for any transaction from which the director derived an
        improper personal benefit. No such provision shall eliminate or
        limit the liability of a director for any act or omission
        occurring prior to the date when such provision becomes
        effective. . . ."

     The board of directors is empowered to make other indemnification as
authorized under any bylaw, agreement, the restated certificate of
incorporation, bylaws or corporate resolutions so long as the indemnification is
consistent with the DGCL.

     Patterson's restated certificate of incorporation provides that, to the
fullest extent permitted by the DGCL, a director of Patterson will not be liable
to Patterson or its stockholders for monetary damages for breach of fiduciary
duty as a director. Patterson's bylaws provide that to the extent that a
director or officer of Patterson is successful on the merits of defense of a
suit or proceeding brought against him by reason of the fact that he is a
director or officer of Patterson, he shall be indemnified against expenses
(including attorneys' fees) reasonably incurred in connection with such action.
In other circumstances, a director or officer of Patterson may be indemnified
against expenses (including attorneys' fees), judgments, fines and amounts paid
in settlement actually and reasonably incurred by him in connection with such
action, suit or proceeding if he acted in good faith and in a manner he
reasonably believed to be in and not opposed to the best interest of Patterson,
and, with respect to a criminal action or proceeding, had no reasonable cause to
believe his conduct was unlawful; however, in an action or suit by or in the
right of Patterson to procure a judgment in its favor, such person will not be
indemnified if he has been adjudged to be liable to Patterson unless and only to
the extent that the Delaware Court of Chancery or the court in which such action
or suit was brought determines upon application that, despite the adjudication
of liability but in view of all the circumstances of the case, such person is
fairly and reasonably entitled to indemnify for such expenses which the Court of
Chancery or such other court deems proper. A determination that indemnification
of a director or officer is proper will be made by a disinterested majority of
Patterson's board of directors, by independent legal counsel or by the
stockholders of Patterson.
                                       II-1

Patterson's bylaws also provide that Patterson may advance the payment of
expenses and that the indemnification and advancement of expense provisions of
the bylaws are nonexclusive. Patterson maintains director and officer liability
insurance covering director and officer indemnification.

     The merger agreement provides that, for six years after the effective time
of the merger, Patterson will indemnify the present and former officers and
directors of Patterson from liabilities arising out of actions or omissions in
their capacity as such prior to the effective time of the merger, to the full
extent permitted under the Delaware law or Patterson's certificate of
incorporation, Bylaws. In addition, Patterson will provide UTI's officers and
directors with an insurance and indemnification policy covering a period of six
years following the effective time, but only to the extend related to actions or
omissions at or prior to the effective time; provided that the maximum aggregate
amount of premiums that Patterson will be required to pay to provide and
maintain this coverage is $300,000 per year.

ITEM 22. UNDERTAKINGS

     (a) The undersigned registrant hereby undertakes that, for purposes of
determining any liability under the Securities Act of 1933, each filing of the
registrant's annual report pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934 (and, where applicable, each filing of an employee benefit
plan's annual report pursuant to Section 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of
1934) that is incorporated by reference in the registration statement shall be
deemed to be a new registration statement relating to the securities offered
therein, and the offering of such securities at that time shall be deemed to be
the initial bona fide offering thereof.

                                       II-3

     (b) The undersigned registrant hereby undertakes that prior to any public
reoffering of the securities registered hereunder through the use of a
prospectus which is a part of this registration statement, by any person or
party who is deemed to be an underwriter within the meaning of Rule 145(c), such
reoffering prospectus will contain the information called for by the applicable
registration form with respect to reofferings by persons who may be deemed
underwriters, in addition to the information called for by the other Items of
the applicable form.

     (c) The undersigned registrant undertakes that every prospectus (i) that is
filed pursuant to the paragraph immediately preceding, or (ii) that purports to
meet the requirements of Section 10(a)(3) of the Securities Act of 1933 and is
used in connection with an offering of securities subject to Rule 415, will be
filed as part of an amendment to the registration statement and will not be used
until such amendment is effective, and that for purposes of determining any
liability under the Securities Act of 1933, each such post-effective amendment
shall be deemed to be a new registration statement relating to the securities
offered therein and the offering of such securities at that time shall be deemed
to be the initial bona fide offering thereof.

     The undersigned registrant hereby undertakes to respond to requests for
information that is incorporated by reference into the prospectus pursuant to
Items 4, 10(b), 11 or 13 of this form within one business day of receipt of such
request, and to send the incorporated documents by first class mail or other
equally prompt means. This includes information contained in documents filed
subsequent to the effective date of the registration statement through the date
of responding to the request.

     The undersigned registrant hereby undertakes to supply by means of a
post-effective amendment all information concerning a transaction, and the
company being acquired involved therein, that was not the subject of and
included in the registration statement when it became effective.

     Insofar as indemnification for liabilities arising under the Securities Act
of 1933 may be permitted to directors, officers and controlling persons of the
registrant pursuant to the foregoing provisions, or otherwise, the registrant
has been advised that in the opinion of the Securities and Exchange Commission,
such indemnification is against public policy as expressed in the Securities Act
of 1933 and is, therefore, unenforceable. In the event that a claim for
indemnification against such liabilities, other than the payment by the
registrant of expenses incurred or paid by a director, officer or controlling
person in connection with the securities being registered, the registrant will,
unless in the opinion of its counsel the matter has been settled by controlling
precedent, submit to a court of appropriate jurisdiction the question whether
such indemnification by it is against public policy as expressed in the
Securities Act of 1933 and will be governed by the final adjudication of such
issue.

                                       II-4

                                   SIGNATURES

undersigned thereunto duly authorized, in the City of Snyder, State of Texas, on

Section 1.  PREFERRED STOCK

                  corporate acts without a specified vote or consent of holders
                  of such shares (such as, among others, restrictions on
                  modifying the terms of such series or of the Preferred Stock,

                  to the stockholders in the event of the liquidation,

                  (g) the right, if any, to exchange or convert the shares into
                  shares of any other series of the Preferred Stock or into
                  shares of any other class of stock of the Corporation or the
                  securities of any other corporation, and the rate or basis,
                  time, manner, terms, and conditions of exchange or conversion
                  or the method by which the same shall be determined; and

                  and the qualifications, limitations, or restrictions thereof,
                  of the shares of such series.

         The Board of Directors shall fix the terms of each such series by
resolution or resolutions adopted at any time prior to the issuance of the
shares thereof, and the terms of each such series may, subject only to
restrictions, if any, imposed by this Certificate of Incorporation or by
applicable law, vary from the terms of other series to the extent determined by
the Board of Directors from time to time and provided in the resolution or
resolutions fixing the terms of the respective series of the Preferred Stock.

         1.2 Status of Certain Shares. Shares of any series of the Preferred
Stock, whether provided for herein or by resolution or resolutions of the Board
of Directors, which have been redeemed (whether through the operation of a
sinking fund or otherwise) or which, if convertible or exchangeable, have been
converted into or exchanged for shares of stock of any other class or classes,
or which have been purchased or otherwise acquired by the Corporation, shall
have the status of authorized and unissued shares of the Preferred Stock of the
same series and may be reissued as a part of the series of which they were
originally a part or may be reclassified and reissued as part of a new series of
the Preferred Stock to be created by resolution or resolutions of the Board of
Directors or as a part of any other series of the Preferred Stock, all subject
to the conditions or restrictions on issuance set forth herein or in the
resolution or resolutions adopted by the Board of Directors providing for the
issue of any series of the Preferred Stock.

Section 2.  COMMON STOCK

         2.1 Issuance, Consideration, and Terms. Any unissued shares of the
Common Stock may be issued from time to time for such consideration, having a
value of not less than the par value thereof, as may be fixed from time to time
by the Board of Directors. Any treasury shares may be disposed of for such
consideration as may be determined from time to time by the Board of Directors.
The Common Stock shall be subject to the express terms of the Preferred Stock
and any series thereof. Each share of Common Stock shall be of equal rank and
shall be identical to every other share of Common Stock. Holders of Common Stock
shall have such rights as are provided herein and by law.

         2.2 Voting Rights. Except as expressly required by law or as provided
in or fixed and determined pursuant to Section 1 of this Article FOURTH, the
entire voting power and all voting rights shall be vested exclusively in the
Common Stock. Each holder of shares of Common Stock shall be entitled to one (1)
vote for each share standing in such holder's name on the books of the
Corporation.

         2.3 Dividends. Subject to Section 1 of this Article FOURTH, the holders
of Common Stock shall be entitled to receive, and shall share equally share for
share, when and as declared by the Board of Directors, out of the assets of the
Corporation which are by law available therefor, dividends or distributions
payable in cash, in property, or in securities of the Corporation.

         FIFTH: The Board of Directors is authorized to make, alter, or repeal
the Bylaws of the Corporation.

         SIXTH: Meetings of stockholders shall be held at such place, within or
without the State of Delaware, as may be designated by or in the manner provided
in the Bylaws, or, if not so designated, at the registered office of the
Corporation in the State of Delaware. Elections of directors need not be by
written ballot unless and to the extent that the Bylaws so provide.

         SEVENTH: Special meetings of the stockholders of the Corporation for
any purpose or purposes may be called at any time by the Board of Directors (or
a majority of the members thereof) of the Corporation by action at a meeting, a
majority of the members of the Board of Directors of the Corporation acting
without a meeting, the Chief Executive Officer of the Corporation, the President
of the Corporation or the holders of a majority of the issued and outstanding
stock of the Corporation entitled to be voted at such special meeting. Such
special meetings may not be called by any other person or persons or in any
other manner.

         EIGHTH: The Corporation reserves the right to amend, alter, or repeal
any provision contained in this Certificate of Incorporation in the manner now
or hereafter prescribed by statute, and all rights of stockholders herein are

OPINION OF BAKER & HOSTETLER LLP

                                                                     EXHIBIT 5.1

Patterson Energy, Inc.

P.O. Box 1416
Snyder, Texas 79550

         Re:      UTI Energy Corp.

Gentlemen:

         We have acted as counsel to Patterson Energy, Inc., a Delaware
corporation ("Patterson"), in connection with the proposed issuance of shares of
common stock, par value $.01 per share ("Common Shares"), of Patterson, in
connection with the Agreement and Plan of Merger dated as of February 4, 2001
(the "Merger Agreement"), between Patterson and UTI Energy Corp. ("UTI").
Following a special meeting of stockholders of Patterson at which such
stockholders will be asked, among other things, to adopt the Merger Agreement
and approve the Merger, and approve an amendment to Patterson's Restated
Certificate of Incorporation to increase Patterson's authorized common shares
from fifty million to two hundred million shares (the "Charter Amendment") and
subject to receipt of such approval and satisfaction or waiver of the other
conditions to the Merger set forth in the Merger Agreement, UTI will be merged
with and into Patterson (the "Merger"), and each outstanding common share of UTI
will be converted into one common share of Patterson (in the aggregate, the
"Shares"), all as more fully described in the Registration Statement on Form S-4
(the "Registration Statement") filed by Patterson with the Securities and
Exchange Commission under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended.

         In connection with this opinion, we have examined the form of the
Charter Amendment. In addition, we have examined, and have relied as to matters
of fact upon, such other documents, corporate records and other instruments, and
have made such other and further investigations, as we have deemed relevant and
necessary as a basis for the opinion hereinafter set forth. In our examinations,
we have assumed the genuineness of all signatures, the authenticity of all
documents submitted to us as originals, photostatic or conformed copies and the
authenticity of the original of all such latter documents.

         Based upon the foregoing, and subject to adoption of the Merger
Agreement and approval of the Merger and approval of the Charter Amendment and
the filing of the Charter Amendment with the Secretary of State of Delaware, we
are of the opinion that the Shares, when issued in accordance with the Merger
Agreement, will be validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable.

         We hereby consent (i) to be named in the Registration Statement, and in
the Prospectus that constitutes a part thereof, as attorneys passing upon the
validity of the issuance of the Shares on behalf of Patterson, and (ii) to the
filing of this opinion as an exhibit to Patterson's Registration Statement.

         This opinion is to be used solely for the purpose of the registration
of the Shares and may not be used for any other purpose.

                                                           Very truly yours,

                                                           BAKER & HOSTETLER LLP

OPINION OF BAKER & HOSTETLER LLP

                                                                     EXHIBIT 8.1

                                  March 6, 2001

Patterson Energy, Inc.
4510 Lamesa Highway
P.O. Box 1416
Snyder, Texas 79550

Gentlemen:

                  You have requested our opinion concerning certain United
States federal income tax consequences of the proposed merger (the "MERGER") of
UTI Energy Corp., a Delaware corporation ("UTI"), with and into Patterson
Energy, Inc., a Delaware corporation ("PEC"), pursuant to that certain Agreement
and Plan of Merger dated February 4, 2001 (the "MERGER AGREEMENT"), by and
between PEC and UTI. Descriptions of the parties and of the Merger and related
transactions are set forth in the Merger Agreement and the Proxy
Statement/Prospectus (the "PROXY STATEMENT") included as part of the
Registration Statement on Form S-4 filed with the Securities and Exchange
Commission on March 6, 2001 (the "REGISTRATION STATEMENT").

                  In rendering this opinion, we have examined, and are relying
upon (without any independent investigation or review thereof) the truth,
accuracy and completeness at all relevant times (including as of the date hereof
and as of the effective time of the Merger) of, the information, facts,
statements, representations and covenants contained in (i) the Merger Agreement,
(ii) the Proxy Statement, and (iii) the officers' certificates dated March 6,
2001, and March 6, 2001, which were provided to us by PEC and UTI and are
attached hereto as EXHIBIT A and EXHIBIT B, respectively. In addition, we assume
that the Merger will be consummated in accordance with the Merger Agreement and
as described in the Proxy Statement. Any inaccuracy in any of the aforementioned
information, facts, statements, representations and assumptions or breach of any
of the aforementioned covenants could adversely affect our opinion.

                             SUMMARY OF TRANSACTIONS

                  Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, at the effective time UTI
will be merged with and into PEC pursuant to the provisions of and with the
effect provided in the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware. PEC
will be the surviving corporation resulting from the Merger. In the Merger, PEC
will succeed to all of the assets of UTI.

                  At the effective time of the Merger, the issued and
outstanding capital stock of UTI will consist solely of shares of common stock,
$0.001 par value ("UTI COMMON STOCK").

In the Merger, each share of UTI Common Stock (other than shares of UTI Common
Stock held in the treasury of UTI) will be automatically converted into one (1)
share of validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable voting common stock, $0.01
par value, of PEC ("PEC COMMON STOCK"). Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, any
shares of UTI Common Stock that are held in the treasury of UTI will be canceled
and no shares of PEC Common Stock or other consideration will be paid or payable
in exchange therefor. The consideration paid to UTI stockholders for their UTI
Common Stock will consist solely of PEC Common Stock.

                  The Merger Agreement provides that the parties intend the
Merger to constitute a reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of
the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "CODE").

                                     OPINION

                  Based upon the foregoing and such legal considerations as we
deem relevant, and subject to the matters, limitations and qualifications set
forth herein, it is our opinion that for United States federal income tax
purposes, the Merger will qualify as a reorganization within the meaning of
Section 368(a) of the Code.

                         LIMITATIONS AND QUALIFICATIONS

                  This opinion is based upon our interpretation of the Code,
applicable Treasury regulations, judicial authority and administrative rulings
and practice, all as of the date hereof. There can be no assurance that future
legislative, judicial or administrative changes or interpretations will not
adversely affect the accuracy of the conclusions set forth herein. Neither PEC
nor UTI has requested or received any advance ruling from the Internal Revenue
Service (the "Service") pertaining to the transactions described herein. Our
opinion will not be binding upon the Service or any court, and no assurance can
be given that the Service will not adopt a contrary position and challenge some
or all of the conclusions set forth above in an audit of a UTI stockholder or of
one or both of the parties to the Merger. If such a challenge occurs, it may be
necessary to resort to administrative proceedings or litigation in an effort to
sustain such conclusions, and there can be no assurance that such conclusions
ultimately will be sustained. In the event that the Merger were held not to
qualify as a reorganization under Section 368(a) of the Code, UTI would
recognize gain or loss on the transfer of its assets to PEC and each stockholder
of UTI would recognize gain or loss in an amount equal to the difference between
such stockholder's basis in his or her shares of UTI Common Stock and the fair
market value, as of the effective date of the Merger, of the PEC Common Stock
received in exchange therefor. In such event, such stockholder's basis in the
PEC Common Stock so received would be equal to its fair market value as of the
effective date of the Merger, and the holding period for such stock would begin
on the day after the effective date of the Merger.

                  Our opinion does not address all tax consequences applicable
to the Merger and is limited to the specific tax opinion set forth above, and no
other opinions are expressed or implied. Moreover, tax consequences that are
different from or in addition to those described herein may apply to UTI
stockholders who are subject to special treatment under the United States
federal income tax laws, including, but not limited to, those referred to in the
first paragraph under the caption "Certain United States Federal Income Tax
Consequences" in the Proxy Statement. Further, our opinion is limited to the
United States federal income tax consequences of the transactions described
herein. Thus, for example, no opinion is expressed concerning any state, local
or foreign tax consequences of such transactions.

                  This opinion is delivered to you solely in connection with and
for purposes of the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement and is not
to be relied upon by any other person, quoted in whole in part, or otherwise
referred to (except in a list of closing documents), nor is it to be provided to
any other person without our prior written consent.

                  We hereby consent to the filing of this opinion as an exhibit
to the Registration Statement, and to the reference to us under the caption
"Certain United States Federal Income Tax Consequences" in the Proxy Statement.
In giving this consent, however, we do not hereby admit that we are within the
category of persons whose consent is required under Section 7 of the Securities
Act of 1933, as amended, or the rules and regulations of the Securities and
Exchange Commission thereunder.

                              Sincerely,

                              BAKER & HOSTETLER LLP

                                                                       EXHIBIT A

                             PATTERSON ENERGY, INC.

                              OFFICER'S CERTIFICATE

         The undersigned, a duly authorized officer of Patterson Energy, Inc., a
Delaware corporation traded on The Nasdaq Stock Market ("PEC"), and acting as
such, in connection with the opinions to be delivered by the law firms of
Fulbright & Jaworski L.L.P. and Baker & Hostetler LLP with respect to the
proposed merger (the "MERGER") of UTI Energy Corp., a Delaware corporation
traded on the American Stock Exchange ("UTI"), with and into PEC pursuant to
that certain Agreement and Plan of Merger dated February 4, 2001 (the

certifies that the undersigned is familiar with the transactions contemplated

the best knowledge and belief of the management of PEC as follows:

         1. The representations made by PEC in the Agreement and the facts and
other information that relate to the Merger and related transactions as
described in the Proxy Statement/Prospectus included in the Registration
Statement on Form S-4 filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on March
6, 2001, are true, accurate and complete, and will be true, accurate and
complete at the effective time of the Merger (the "EFFECTIVE TIME"). Capitalized
terms not otherwise defined herein shall have the meanings ascribed thereto in
the Agreement.

         2. The fair market value of the PEC stock to be received by each UTI
stockholder will be approximately equal to the fair market value of the UTI
stock surrendered by such stockholder in exchange therefor.

         3. PEC has no plan or intention to reacquire any of its stock issued to
the holders of UTI stock pursuant to the Merger.

         4. PEC has no plan or intention to sell or otherwise dispose of any of
the assets of UTI acquired in the Merger, except for dispositions made in the
ordinary course of business or transfers of assets described in Section
368(a)(2)(C) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "CODE").

         5. No person related to PEC within the meaning of Treasury Regulation
section 1.368-1(e) has acquired (or has any plan or intention to acquire) any
UTI stock.

         6. Following the Merger, PEC will continue UTI's "historic business" or
use a "significant portion" of UTI's historic business assets in a business, as
such terms are used in Treasury Regulation section 1.368-1(d).

         7. PEC will pay its expenses, if any, incurred in connection with the
Merger.

                                      -1-

                                                                       EXHIBIT A

         8. There is no intercorporate indebtedness existing between PEC or any
of its subsidiaries and UTI or any of its subsidiaries that was issued, acquired
or will be settled at a discount.

         9. Neither PEC nor any entity in which PEC owns a controlling interest
owns, or has owned during the past five years, any shares of the capital stock
of UTI.

         10. PEC is not an investment company as defined in Section
368(a)(2)(F)(iii) and (iv) of the Code.

         11. PEC is not under the jurisdiction of a court in a Title 11 or
similar case within the meaning of Section 368(a)(3)(A) of the Code. That is,
PEC is not a party to a case under Title 11 of the United States Code or to a
receivership, foreclosure or similar proceeding in a federal or state court.

         12. None of the compensation to be received by any
stockholder-employees of UTI will be separate consideration for, or allocable
to, any of their shares of UTI stock; none of the shares of PEC stock to be
received by any stockholder-employees of UTI will be separate consideration for,
or allocable to, any employment agreement; and the compensation paid to any
stockholder-employees of UTI will be for services actually rendered and will be
commensurate with amounts paid to third parties bargaining at arm's length for
similar services.

         13. No fractional share of PEC stock will be issued with respect to the
Merger.

         14. There will be no dissenters' rights available with respect to the
Merger.

         15. At no time during the two-year period ending at the Effective Time
has PEC distributed to its stockholders or security holders stock or securities
of a controlled corporation in a transaction to which Section 355(a) of the Code
applied.

         16. Holders of UTI Warrants (the "Warrant Holders") will receive PEC
Warrants in the Merger in exchange for their UTI Warrants. With respect to the

the Merger relating to shares of PEC Common Stock will have the same terms and
conditions as the rights of such Warrant Holder before the Merger relating to
shares of UTI Common Stock.

         17. The Warrant Holders will receive the same amount of PEC Common
Stock upon exercise of their PEC Warrants as they would have received had they
exercised their UTI Warrants before the Merger and received PEC Common Stock in
the Merger in exchange for the UTI Common Stock they would have received as a
result of such exercise.

         18. With respect to the assumption of each UTI Stock Option by PEC, the
rights of the holder of such UTI Stock Option after the Merger relating to
shares of PEC Common Stock will have the same terms and conditions as the rights
of such holder before the Merger relating to shares of UTI Common Stock. Holders
of UTI Stock Options will not receive any additional benefits as a result of the
assumption of UTI Stock Options by PEC in the Merger.

                                      -2-

                                                                       EXHIBIT A

         19. Holders of UTI Stock Options (the "Option Holders") will receive
PEC Stock Options in the Merger in exchange for their UTI Stock Options. With
respect to the assumption of UTI Stock Options by PEC, neither before nor after
the Merger will any of the UTI Stock Options have a readily ascertainable fair
market value within the meaning of Treasury Regulation Section 1.83-7(b). UTI
Stock Options are not actively traded on an established securities market and
are not transferable except by will or the laws of descent and distribution.
Similarly, UTI Stock Options as they will exist after the Merger will not be
actively traded on an established securities market and will not be transferable
except by will or the laws of descent and distribution.

         20. The Option Holders will receive the same amount of PEC Common Stock
upon exercise of their PEC Stock Options as they would have received had they
exercised their UTI Stock Options before the Merger and received PEC Common
Stock in the Merger in exchange for the UTI Common Stock they would have
received as a result of such exercise.

         21. PEC will not take or omit to take any action (whether before, on or
after the Effective Time) that would cause the Merger to fail to qualify as a
reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code.

         22. PEC will treat, record and account for the Merger as a
reorganization under Section 368(a) of the Code for all purposes, including, but
not limited to, United States federal income tax purposes, and all financial
accounting and regulatory purposes.

         23. The Merger and related transactions will be carried out in
accordance with the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware and the
terms of the Agreement, including any attachments thereto, and there are no
other relevant agreements, arrangements or understandings relating to the Merger
other than those described or referenced in the Agreement. None of the material
terms and conditions in the Agreement have been waived or modified and no plan
or intention exists to waive or modify any of such material terms and
conditions. The Merger advances and promotes substantial bona fide business
purposes of PEC and UTI.

         24. PEC is authorized to make all of the representations made by it and
set forth herein.

         I understand that (i) you will rely upon the above representations by
us in connection with issuing your opinion, (ii) the representations in this
Officer's Certificate are made as of the date hereof and as of the Effective
Time, and (iii) you may disclose these representations in connection with
issuing your opinions.

         10. UTI is not under the jurisdiction of a court in a Title 11 or
similar case within the meaning of Section 368(a)(3)(A) of the Code. That is,
UTI is not a party to a case under Title 11 of the United States Code or to a
receivership, foreclosure or similar proceeding in a federal or state court.

         11. None of the compensation to be received by any
stockholder-employees of UTI will be separate consideration for, or allocable
to, any of their shares of UTI stock; none of the shares of PEC stock to be
received by any stockholder-employees of UTI will be separate consideration for,
or allocable to, any employment agreement; and the compensation paid to any
stockholder-employees of UTI will be for services actually rendered and will be
commensurate with amounts paid to third parties bargaining at arm's length for
similar services.

         12. No fractional share of PEC stock will be issued with respect to the
Merger.

         13. There will be no dissenters' rights available with respect to the
Merger.

applied.

         15. Holders of UTI Warrants (the "Warrant Holders") will receive PEC
Warrants in the Merger in exchange for their UTI Warrants. With respect to the
assumption of each UTI Warrant by PEC, the rights of each Warrant Holder after
the Merger relating to shares of PEC Common Stock will have the same terms and
conditions as the rights of such Warrant Holder before the Merger relating to
shares of UTI Common Stock.

         16. The Warrant Holders will receive the same amount of PEC Common
Stock upon exercise of their PEC Warrants as they would have received had they
exercised their UTI Warrants before the Merger and received PEC Common Stock in
the Merger in exchange for the UTI Common Stock they would have received as a
result of such exercise.

         17. With respect to the assumption of each UTI Stock Option by PEC, the
rights of the holder of such UTI Stock Option after the Merger relating to
shares of PEC Common Stock will have the same terms and conditions as the rights
of such holder before the Merger relating to shares of UTI Common Stock. Holders
of UTI Stock Options will not receive any additional benefits as a result of the
assumption of UTI Stock Options by PEC in the Merger.

         18. Holders of UTI Stock Options (the "Option Holders") will receive
PEC Stock Options in the Merger in exchange for their UTI Stock Options. With
respect to the assumption of UTI Stock Options by PEC, neither before nor after
the Merger will any of the UTI Stock Options have a readily ascertainable fair
market value within the meaning of Treasury

                                      -2-

                                                                       EXHIBIT B

Regulation Section 1.83-7(b). UTI Stock Options are not actively traded on an
established securities market and are not transferable except by will or the
laws of descent and distribution. Similarly, UTI Stock Options as they will
exist after the Merger will not be actively traded on an established securities
market and will not be transferable except by will or the laws of descent and
distribution.

         19. The Option Holders will receive the same amount of PEC Common Stock
upon exercise of their PEC Stock Options as they would have received had they
exercised their UTI Stock Options before the Merger and received PEC Common
Stock in the Merger in exchange for the UTI Common Stock they would have
received as a result of such exercise.

         20. UTI will not take or omit to take any action (whether before, on or
after the Effective Time) that would cause the Merger to fail to qualify as a
reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code.

         21. UTI will treat, record and account for the Merger as a
reorganization under Section 368(a) of the Code for all purposes, including, but
not limited to, United States federal income tax purposes, and all financial
accounting and regulatory purposes.

         22. The Merger and related transactions will be carried out in
accordance with the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware and the
terms of the Agreement, including any attachments thereto, and there are no
other relevant agreements, arrangements or understandings relating to the Merger
other than those described or referenced in the Agreement. None of the material
terms and conditions in the Agreement have been waived or modified and no plan
or intention exists to waive or modify any of such material terms and
conditions. The Merger advances and promotes substantial bona fide business
purposes of PEC and UTI.

         23. UTI has not transferred any asset to its stockholders in
anticipation of the Merger.

         24. UTI is authorized to make all of the representations made by it and
set forth herein.

         I understand that (i) you will rely upon the above representations by
us in connection with issuing your opinion, (ii) the representations in this

OPINION OF FULBRIGHT & JAWORSKI LLP

                                                                     EXHIBIT 8.2

March 6, 2001

UTI Energy Corp.
16800 Greenspoint Park Drive, Suite 225N
Houston, Texas 77060

Gentlemen:

                  You have requested our opinion concerning certain United
States federal income tax consequences of the proposed merger (the "MERGER") of
UTI Energy Corp., a Delaware corporation ("UTI"), with and into Patterson
Energy, Inc., a Delaware corporation ("PEC"), pursuant to that certain Agreement
and Plan of Merger dated February 4, 2001 (the "MERGER AGREEMENT"), by and
between PEC and UTI. Descriptions of the parties and of the Merger and related
transactions are set forth in the Merger Agreement and the Proxy
Statement/Prospectus (the "PROXY STATEMENT") included as part of the
Registration Statement on Form S-4 filed with the Securities and Exchange
Commission on March 6, 2001 (the "REGISTRATION STATEMENT").

                  In rendering this opinion, we have examined, and are relying
upon (without any independent investigation or review thereof) the truth,
accuracy and completeness at all relevant times (including as of the date hereof
and as of the effective time of the Merger) of, the information, facts,
statements, representations and covenants contained in (i) the Merger Agreement,
(ii) the Proxy Statement, and (iii) the officers' certificates dated March 6,
2001, and March 6, 2001, which were provided to us by PEC and UTI and are
attached hereto as EXHIBIT A and EXHIBIT B, respectively. In addition, we assume
that the Merger will be consummated in accordance with the Merger Agreement and
as described in the Proxy Statement. Any inaccuracy in any of the aforementioned
information, facts, statements, representations and assumptions or breach of any
of the aforementioned covenants could adversely affect our opinion.

                             SUMMARY OF TRANSACTIONS

                  Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, at the effective time UTI
will be merged with and into PEC pursuant to the provisions of and with the
effect provided in the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware. PEC
will be the surviving corporation resulting from the Merger. In the Merger, PEC
will succeed to all of the assets of UTI.

                  At the effective time of the Merger, the issued and
outstanding capital stock of UTI will consist solely of shares of common stock,
$0.001 par value ("UTI COMMON STOCK"). In the Merger, each share of UTI Common
Stock (other than shares of UTI Common Stock held in the treasury of UTI) will
be automatically converted into one (1) share of validly issued, fully paid and
nonassessable voting common stock, $0.01 par value, of PEC ("PEC COMMON STOCK").
Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, any shares of UTI Common Stock that are held
in the treasury of UTI will be canceled and no shares of PEC Common Stock or
other consideration will be paid

or payable in exchange therefor. The consideration paid to UTI stockholders for
their UTI Common Stock will consist solely of PEC Common Stock.

                  The Merger Agreement provides that the parties intend the
Merger to constitute a reorganization within the meaning of section 368(a) of
the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "CODE").

                                     OPINION

                  Based upon the foregoing and such legal considerations as we
deem relevant, and subject to the matters, limitations and qualifications set
forth herein, it is our opinion that for United States federal income tax
purposes, the Merger will qualify as a reorganization within the meaning of
section 368(a) of the Code.

                         LIMITATIONS AND QUALIFICATIONS

                  This opinion is based upon our interpretation of the Code,
applicable Treasury regulations, judicial authority and administrative rulings
and practice, all as of the date hereof. There can be no assurance that future
legislative, judicial or administrative changes or interpretations will not
adversely affect the accuracy of the conclusions set forth herein. Neither PEC
nor UTI has requested or received any advance ruling from the Internal Revenue
Service (the "Service") pertaining to the transactions described herein. Our
opinion will not be binding upon the Service or any court, and no assurance can
be given that the Service will not adopt a contrary position and challenge some
or all of the conclusions set forth above in an audit of a UTI stockholder or of
one or both of the parties to the Merger. If such a challenge occurs, it may be
necessary to resort to administrative proceedings or litigation in an effort to
sustain such conclusions, and there can be no assurance that such conclusions
ultimately will be sustained. In the event that the Merger were held not to
qualify as a reorganization under section 368(a) of the Code, a stockholder of
UTI would recognize gain or loss in an amount equal to the difference between
such stockholder's basis in his or her shares of UTI Common Stock and the fair
market value, as of the effective date of the Merger, of the PEC Common Stock
received in exchange therefor. In such event, such stockholder's basis in the
PEC Common Stock so received would be equal to its fair market value as of the
effective date of the Merger, and the holding period for such stock would begin
on the day after the effective date of the Merger.

                  Our opinion does not address all tax consequences applicable
to the Merger and is limited to the specific tax opinion set forth above, and no
other opinions are expressed or implied. Moreover, tax consequences that are
different from or in addition to those described herein may apply to UTI
stockholders who are subject to special treatment under the United States
federal income tax laws, including, but not limited to, those referred to in the
first paragraph under the caption "Certain United States Federal Income Tax
Consequences" in the Proxy Statement. Further, our opinion is limited to the
United States federal income tax consequences of the transactions described
herein. Thus, for example, no opinion is expressed concerning any state, local
or foreign tax consequences of such transactions.

                  This opinion is delivered to you solely in connection with and
for purposes of the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement and is not
to be relied upon by any other person, quoted in whole in part, or otherwise
referred to (except in a list of closing documents), nor is it to be provided to
any other person without our prior written consent.

                  We hereby consent to the filing of this opinion as an exhibit
to the Registration Statement, and to the reference to us under the caption
"Certain United States Federal Income Tax Consequences" in the Proxy Statement.
In giving this consent, however, we do not hereby admit that we are within the
category of persons whose consent is required under section 7 of the Securities
Act of 1933, as amended, or the rules and regulations of the Securities and
Exchange Commission thereunder.

                                               Very truly yours,
                                               Fulbright & Jaworski L.L.P.

terms not otherwise defined herein shall have the meanings ascribed thereto in
the Agreement.

         2. The fair market value of the PEC stock to be received by each UTI

the holders of UTI stock pursuant to the Merger.

         4. PEC has no plan or intention to sell or otherwise dispose of any of

         5. No person related to PEC within the meaning of Treasury Regulation
section 1.368-1(e) has acquired (or has any plan or intention to acquire) any

         7. PEC will pay its expenses, if any, incurred in connection with the
Merger.

                                      -1-

         8. There is no intercorporate indebtedness existing between PEC or any
of its subsidiaries and UTI or any of its subsidiaries that was issued, acquired
or will be settled at a discount.

         9. Neither PEC nor any entity in which PEC owns a controlling interest
owns, or has owned during the past five years, any shares of the capital stock
of UTI.

         10. PEC is not an investment company as defined in Section
368(a)(2)(F)(iii) and (iv) of the Code.

         11. PEC is not under the jurisdiction of a court in a Title 11 or
similar case within the meaning of Section 368(a)(3)(A) of the Code. That is,
PEC is not a party to a case under Title 11 of the United States Code or to a
receivership, foreclosure or similar proceeding in a federal or state court.

         12. None of the compensation to be received by any
stockholder-employees of UTI will be separate consideration for, or allocable
to, any of their shares of UTI stock; none of the shares of PEC stock to be
received by any stockholder-employees of UTI will be separate consideration for,
or allocable to, any employment agreement; and the compensation paid to any
stockholder-employees of UTI will be for services actually rendered and will be

other relevant agreements, arrangements or understandings relating to the Merger
other than those described or referenced in the Agreement. None of the material
terms and conditions in the Agreement have been waived or modified and no plan
or intention exists to waive or modify any of such material terms and

conditions as the rights of such Warrant Holder before the Merger relating to
shares of UTI Common Stock.

         16. The Warrant Holders will receive the same amount of PEC Common
Stock upon exercise of their PEC Warrants as they would have received had they
exercised their UTI Warrants before the Merger and received PEC Common Stock in
the Merger in exchange for the UTI Common Stock they would have received as a
result of such exercise.

         17. With respect to the assumption of each UTI Stock Option by PEC, the
rights of the holder of such UTI Stock Option after the Merger relating to
shares of PEC Common Stock will have the same terms and conditions as the rights
of such holder before the Merger relating to shares of UTI Common Stock. Holders
of UTI Stock Options will not receive any additional benefits as a result of the
assumption of UTI Stock Options by PEC in the Merger.

         18. Holders of UTI Stock Options (the "Option Holders") will receive
PEC Stock Options in the Merger in exchange for their UTI Stock Options. With
respect to the assumption of UTI Stock Options by PEC, neither before nor after
the Merger will any of the UTI Stock Options have a readily ascertainable fair
market value within the meaning of Treasury

                                      -2-

Regulation Section 1.83-7(b). UTI Stock Options are not actively traded on an
established securities market and are not transferable except by will or the
laws of descent and distribution. Similarly, UTI Stock Options as they will
exist after the Merger will not be actively traded on an established securities
market and will not be transferable except by will or the laws of descent and
distribution.

         19. The Option Holders will receive the same amount of PEC Common Stock
upon exercise of their PEC Stock Options as they would have received had they
exercised their UTI Stock Options before the Merger and received PEC Common
Stock in the Merger in exchange for the UTI Common Stock they would have
received as a result of such exercise.

         20. UTI will not take or omit to take any action (whether before, on or
after the Effective Time) that would cause the Merger to fail to qualify as a
reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code.

         21. UTI will treat, record and account for the Merger as a
reorganization under Section 368(a) of the Code for all purposes, including, but
not limited to, United States federal income tax purposes, and all financial
accounting and regulatory purposes.

         22. The Merger and related transactions will be carried out in
accordance with the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware and the
terms of the Agreement, including any attachments thereto, and there are no
other relevant agreements, arrangements or understandings relating to the Merger
other than those described or referenced in the Agreement. None of the material
terms and conditions in the Agreement have been waived or modified and no plan
or intention exists to waive or modify any of such material terms and
conditions. The Merger advances and promotes substantial bona fide business
purposes of PEC and UTI.

         23. UTI has not transferred any asset to its stockholders in
anticipation of the Merger.

         24. UTI is authorized to make all of the representations made by it and
set forth herein.

         I understand that (i) you will rely upon the above representations by
us in connection with issuing your opinion, (ii) the representations in this

Time, and (iii) you may disclose these representations in connection with
