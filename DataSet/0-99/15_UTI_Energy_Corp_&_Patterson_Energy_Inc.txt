                 PROPOSED MERGER -- YOUR VOTE IS VERY IMPORTANT

     Patterson Energy, Inc. and UTI Energy Corp. have agreed on a merger
transaction involving our two companies. Before we can complete the merger, we
must obtain the approval of our companies' stockholders. We are sending you this
joint proxy statement/prospectus to ask you to vote in favor of the merger
transaction and related matters.

     In the merger, stockholders of UTI will be entitled to receive one share of
Patterson common stock in return for each share of UTI common stock they own.
Each outstanding share of Patterson common stock will remain outstanding as a
share of Patterson common stock after the merger. Shares of Patterson common
stock, including shares of Patterson common stock issued to stockholders of UTI
as a result of the merger, will continue to be quoted on the Nasdaq National
Market under the trading symbol "PTEN." Shares of UTI common stock, which are
listed on the American Stock Exchange under the trading symbol "UTI," will be
delisted if the merger is consummated.

     Each of us will hold a special meeting of our stockholders to consider and
vote on the merger proposal. At Patterson's special meeting, Patterson will also
ask its stockholders to consider and vote on amendments to Patterson's restated
certificate of incorporation to increase the authorized shares of Patterson's
common stock from 50,000,000 shares to 200,000,000 shares and to change
Patterson's name to "Patterson-UTI Energy, Inc." At UTI's special meeting, UTI
will ask its stockholders to consider and vote on the merger proposal.
Completion of the merger requires UTI stockholder and Patterson stockholder
adoption of the merger proposal and Patterson stockholder adoption of the
proposal to amend Patterson's restated certificate of incorporation to increase
Patterson's authorized common stock. Approval of the name change is not a
condition to the merger.

     YOUR VOTE IS VERY IMPORTANT. Whether or not you plan to attend your special
meeting, please take the time to vote by completing the enclosed proxy card and
mailing it to us, or Patterson stockholders may vote by following the Internet
or telephone instructions on the proxy card. If you sign, date and mail your
proxy card without indicating how you want to vote, your proxy will be counted
as a vote FOR each of the proposals presented. If you neither return your card
nor vote by Internet or telephone, or if you do not instruct your broker how to
vote any shares held for you in "street name," your shares will not be voted at
your special meeting.

     The respective dates, times, and places of the stockholders' meetings are
as follows:

     (4) To transact such other business as may be properly brought before the

     Holders of record of shares of Patterson common stock at the close of

     You are cordially invited to attend the meeting. YOUR VOTE IS IMPORTANT TO

CARD AND RETURN IT PROMPTLY. THE DELIVERY OF THE PROXY DOES NOT PRECLUDE YOU

fair to, and in the best interests of, Patterson and its stockholders. The
members of the Patterson board of directors, with one abstention, recommend that
stockholders vote at the special meeting to adopt the merger agreement and
approve the transactions contemplated by it, including the merger, and approve
the amendments to Patterson's restated certificate of incorporation to increase
the authorized shares of Patterson's common stock and the name change. One of
Patterson's directors abstained from voting on the merger, because he believed
that he lacked sufficient information and time to make an informed decision.

                     QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS ABOUT THE MERGER

Q:   WHAT WILL HAPPEN IN THE MERGER?

A:   The proposed merger will combine the businesses of Patterson and UTI. As a
     result of the merger, UTI will cease to exist and Patterson will continue
     as a public company. UTI stockholders will become Patterson stockholders
     and will own approximately 49.5% of the shares of Patterson common stock
     outstanding immediately after the merger. Current Patterson stockholders
     will own the approximately 50.5% of the remaining shares of Patterson
     common stock outstanding immediately after the merger. The merger
     agreement, which is a contract between Patterson and UTI, is attached to
     this joint proxy statement/prospectus as Annex A. You should read the
     merger agreement carefully in its entirety because it is the legal document
     setting forth the parties' rights.

Q:   WHY ARE PATTERSON AND UTI PROPOSING THE MERGER?

A:   Our companies are proposing the merger because we believe that the
     combination of the operations and resources of our two companies is an
     excellent strategic fit, and that the combined company will be stronger in
     the short term and long term than either company operating alone.

Q:   WHAT WILL THE NEW COMPANY BE CALLED?

A:   "Patterson-UTI Energy, Inc.," if, at the Patterson special meeting,
     Patterson stockholders approve the proposal to amend Patterson's restated
     certificate of incorporation to change Patterson's name, and if not,
     "Patterson Energy, Inc."

Q:   WHAT WILL HAPPEN TO UTI SHARES, OPTIONS AND WARRANTS IN THE MERGER?

A:   UTI stockholders will receive one share of Patterson common stock for each
     share of UTI common stock they own. The shares of Patterson common stock
     received in the merger will be quoted on the Nasdaq National Market under
     the symbol "PTEN." Options and warrants to purchase UTI common stock will
     be converted into options and warrants to purchase shares of Patterson
     common stock based on the same exchange ratio as applies to the conversion
     of UTI common stock.

Q:   WHAT WILL HAPPEN TO SHARES OF PATTERSON COMMON STOCK IN THE MERGER?

A:   Each outstanding share of Patterson common stock will remain outstanding as
     a share of Patterson common stock.

Q:   WHEN ARE THE SPECIAL STOCKHOLDERS' MEETINGS?

A:   Each company's special meeting of stockholders will take place on
               , 2001. The time and location of each special meeting is
     specified on the cover page of this document.

Q:   WHAT WILL HAPPEN AT THE SPECIAL STOCKHOLDERS' MEETINGS?

A:   At the UTI special meeting, UTI stockholders will vote on the merger
     agreement and the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement,
     including the merger. At the Patterson special meeting, Patterson
     stockholders will vote on the merger agreement and the transactions
     contemplated by the merger agreement and will also vote on a proposal to
     amend Patterson's restated certificate of incorporation to increase the
     authorized shares of Patterson's common stock from 50,000,000 shares to
     200,000,000 shares and on a proposal to amend Patterson's restated
     certificate of incorporation to change Patterson's name to "Patterson-UTI
     Energy, Inc." We cannot complete the merger unless, among other things,
     Patterson stockholders vote to adopt the merger agreement and the amendment
     to the restated certificate of incorporation to increase the authorized
     shares of Patterson's common stock. Approval of the name change is not
     necessary to permit consummation of the merger.

Q:   WHAT DO I NEED TO DO TO VOTE?

A:   Mail your signed proxy card in the enclosed return envelope or, in the case
     of Patterson stockholders, you may vote by Internet or by telephone in each
     case as soon as possible so that your shares may be represented at your
     special meeting. In order to assure that we obtain your vote, please vote
     as instructed on your proxy card even if you currently plan to attend your
     special meeting in person.

     THE MEMBERS OF THE UTI BOARD OF DIRECTORS UNANIMOUSLY RECOMMEND THAT UTI
     STOCKHOLDERS VOTE FOR ADOPTION OF THE MERGER AGREEMENT AND APPROVAL OF THE
     TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED BY THE MERGER AGREEMENT, INCLUDING THE MERGER.

     THE MEMBERS OF THE PATTERSON BOARD OF DIRECTORS RECOMMEND THAT PATTERSON
     STOCKHOLDERS VOTE FOR ADOPTION OF THE MERGER AGREEMENT AND APPROVAL OF THE
     TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED BY THE MERGER AGREEMENT, INCLUDING THE MERGER,
     AND THE RESPECTIVE AMENDMENTS TO PATTERSON'S RESTATED CERTIFICATE OF
     INCORPORATION TO INCREASE THE AUTHORIZED SHARES OF PATTERSON COMMON STOCK
     AND TO EFFECT THE NAME CHANGE. ONE OF PATTERSON'S DIRECTORS ABSTAINED FROM
     VOTING ON THE MERGER BECAUSE OF HIS BELIEF THAT HE DID NOT HAVE SUFFICIENT
     INFORMATION AND TIME TO MAKE AN INFORMED DECISION.

Q:   ARE THERE RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH THE MERGER THAT I SHOULD CONSIDER IN
     DECIDING HOW TO VOTE?

A:   Yes. There are risks associated with all business combinations, including
     the merger of our two companies. In particular, you should be aware that
     the number of shares of Patterson common stock that UTI stockholders will
     receive is fixed and will not change as the market prices of UTI common
     stock and Patterson common stock fluctuate in the period before the merger.
     Accordingly, the value of the Patterson common stock that UTI stockholders
     will receive in return for their UTI common stock may be less than or more
     than the value of the Patterson common stock as of the date of the merger
     agreement or the date of this joint proxy statement/prospectus. There are a
     number of other risks that are discussed in this document and in other
     documents incorporated by reference in this document. PLEASE READ WITH
     PARTICULAR CARE THE MORE DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH
     THE MERGER DISCUSSED UNDER "RISK FACTORS" ON PAGE 19.

Q:   WHEN DO YOU EXPECT TO COMPLETE THE MERGER?

A:   We expect to complete the merger as quickly as possible once all the
     conditions to the merger, including obtaining the approvals of our
     stockholders at the special meetings, are fulfilled or waived. Fulfilling
     some of these conditions, such as receiving certain governmental clearances
     or approvals, is not entirely within our control. We expect to complete the
     merger in the second quarter of 2001.

Q:   SHOULD I SEND IN MY UTI STOCK CERTIFICATES NOW?

A:   No. After the merger is completed, we will send written instructions to UTI
     stockholders that explain how to exchange UTI stock certificates for
     Patterson stock certificates. We will also send a letter of transmittal
     that must be executed by UTI stockholders. Please do not send in any UTI
     stock certificates until you receive these written instructions and the
     letter of transmittal.

Q:   HOW DO I VOTE MY SHARES IF MY SHARES ARE HELD IN "STREET NAME"?

A:   You should vote this proxy in accordance with the instructions provided to
     you by your broker. Your broker will not vote your shares unless the broker
     receives appropriate instructions from you.

Q:   MAY I CHANGE MY VOTE EVEN AFTER RETURNING A PROXY CARD?

A:   Yes. If you are a UTI stockholder and want to change your vote, you may do
     so at any time before the UTI special meeting by sending to the Secretary
     of UTI a proxy with a later date. Alternatively, you may revoke your proxy
     by delivering to the Secretary of UTI a written revocation prior to the UTI
     special meeting or by voting in person at the UTI special meeting.
     Similarly,

     if you are a Patterson stockholder and want to change your vote, you may do
     so at any time before the Patterson special meeting by sending to the
     Secretary of Patterson a proxy with a later date. Alternatively, you may
     revoke your proxy by delivering to the Secretary of Patterson a written
     revocation prior to the Patterson special meeting or by voting in person at
     the Patterson special meeting. UTI stockholders that require assistance in
     changing or revoking a proxy should contact Mellon Investor Services LLC,
     UTI's transfer agent for the merger, at (214) 922-4400. Patterson
     stockholders that require assistance in changing or revoking a proxy should
     contact Michael Nelson at Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company,
     Patterson's transfer agent for the merger, at (212) 509-4000.

Q:   WILL UTI STOCKHOLDERS BE ABLE TO TRADE THE PATTERSON COMMON STOCK THAT THEY
     RECEIVE IN THE MERGER?

A:   Yes. The Patterson common stock will be quoted on the Nasdaq National
     Market under the symbol "PTEN." However, persons who are affiliates of UTI
     will not be able to sell the Patterson common stock received in the merger
     unless they comply with Rule 145 under the Securities Act and certain
     restrictions under accounting rules relating to pooling-of-interests
     accounting treatment. Affiliates of Patterson will also be restricted under
     the pooling-of-interests accounting rules. Pursuant to the merger
     agreement, these persons have signed agreements acknowledging these
     restrictions.

Q:   WHAT HAPPENS IF I CHOOSE NOT TO SUBMIT A PROXY OR TO VOTE?

A:   If a UTI stockholder does not submit a proxy or vote at the UTI special
     stockholder meeting, it will have the same effect as a vote against
     adoption and approval of the merger agreement and the merger. If a
     Patterson stockholder does not submit a proxy or vote at the Patterson
     special stockholder meeting, it will have the same effect as a vote against
     the adoption and approval of the merger agreement and the merger and
     against the respective amendments to Patterson's restated certificate of
     incorporation.

Q:   WHAT ARE THE FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSEQUENCES OF THE MERGER?

A:   The merger is conditioned on the receipt of an opinion from Baker &
     Hostetler LLP to Patterson and an opinion from Fulbright & Jaworski L.L.P.
     to UTI that the merger qualifies as a reorganization within the meaning of
     Section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. If the
     merger so qualifies, no gain or loss will be recognized by UTI's
     stockholders or UTI as a result of the merger. In addition, Patterson's
     stockholders and Patterson will not recognize gain or loss as a result of
     the merger.

     Tax matters are complicated, and the federal income tax consequences
     described above may not apply to some of UTI's stockholders. The tax
     consequences of the proposed transactions to you will depend on the facts
     of your own situation. You should consult your own tax advisors for a full
     understanding of the tax consequences to you of the merger.

Q:   AM I ENTITLED TO APPRAISAL RIGHTS?

A:   No. Neither holders of shares of UTI common stock nor holders of shares of
     Patterson common stock are entitled to appraisal rights in connection with
     the merger.

Q:   WILL THE RIGHTS OF A UTI STOCKHOLDER CHANGE AS A RESULT OF THE MERGER?

A:   Yes. Through the date of the merger, Patterson stockholder rights will
     continue to be governed by Patterson's restated certificate of
     incorporation and bylaws, and UTI stockholder rights will continue to be
     governed by UTI's restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws. Upon
     completion of the merger, UTI stockholders will become Patterson
     stockholders and their rights will then be governed by Patterson's restated
     certificate of incorporation and bylaws. Please read carefully the summary
     of the material differences between the rights of Patterson stockholders
     and UTI stockholders under the

     heading "Comparison of Stockholders' Rights."

Q:   IF I HAVE MORE QUESTIONS ABOUT THE MERGER OR THE TWO COMPANIES, WHERE CAN I
     FIND ANSWERS?

A:   In addition to reading this document, its annexes, and the documents we
     have incorporated in this document by reference, you can find more
     information about the merger or about the two companies in our companies'
     filings with the SEC and, in the case of Patterson, with the Nasdaq

RECORD DATE; VOTE REQUIRED

  UTI STOCKHOLDERS

     You can vote at the UTI special meeting if you owned shares of UTI common
stock at the close of business on March 13, 2001. On that date, there were
          shares of UTI common stock outstanding and entitled to vote. You can

merger agreement and approval of the transactions contemplated by the merger
agreement, including the merger, requires the approval of the holders of a
majority of the outstanding shares of UTI common stock. Abstentions and broker
non-votes will be the equivalent of a "no" vote on the adoption of the merger
agreement and the approval of the transactions contemplated by the merger
agreement.

     As of March 13, 2001, UTI directors and executive officers have the right
to vote approximately      % of the outstanding shares of UTI common stock.
These individuals have indicated that they intend to vote in favor of the merger
proposal.

  PATTERSON STOCKHOLDERS

     You can vote at the Patterson special meeting if you owned shares of
Patterson common stock at the close of business on March 13, 2001. On that date,

restated certificate of incorporation. Approval of the proposal to amend
Patterson's restated certificate of incorporation to increase the authorized
shares of Patterson common stock is a prerequisite to the adoption of the merger
agreement.

THE MERGER (PAGE 27)

  GENERAL

     On February 5, 2001, we announced that the boards of directors of our
companies had approved a merger of our two companies. When the merger is
completed, each holder of shares of UTI common stock will receive one share of
Patterson common stock. The name of the company following the merger is expected
to be "Patterson-UTI Energy, Inc." The consummation of the merger is subject to
customary conditions, including approval of the stockholders of both companies
and necessary regulatory approvals, and other terms and provisions that are set
forth in the merger agreement. The merger agreement is attached as Annex A to
this document. Please read carefully the merger agreement. The merger agreement
is the legal document that governs the merger.

  EXCHANGE OF COMMON STOCK

     When the merger is completed, all shares of outstanding UTI common stock
will be converted into shares of Patterson common stock.

     UTI Stockholders.  Each share of UTI common stock held prior to the
effective time of the merger will be converted into the right to receive one
share of Patterson common stock. At the effective time of the merger, Patterson
will assume each UTI option outstanding at that time under UTI's employee stock
option plan, non-employee director stock option plan, long term incentive plan
and an employee stock option plan that UTI assumed in a 1999 acquisition. Each
assumed UTI option will become an option to acquire, on the same basis and
conditions, one share of Patterson common stock at the same exercise price.
Patterson will also assume each UTI warrant outstanding at the effective time.
Each assumed UTI warrant will become a warrant to acquire, on the same terms and
conditions, one share of Patterson common stock at the same exercise price.

     Former UTI stockholders will own approximately 49.5% of the shares of
Patterson-UTI common stock outstanding immediately after the merger, without
giving consideration to shares of Patterson common stock issuable upon exercise
of UTI options and warrants to be assumed by Patterson as a part of the merger.

     Patterson Stockholders.  Each share of Patterson common stock will remain
issued and outstanding as one share of Patterson common stock. Holders of shares
of Patterson common stock immediately prior to the merger will own approximately
50.5% of the Patterson-UTI common stock outstanding immediately after the
merger, without giving consideration to shares of Patterson common stock
issuable upon exercise of UTI options and warrants to be assumed by Patterson as
a part of the merger.

  OUR RECOMMENDATIONS TO STOCKHOLDERS

     UTI Stockholders.  (Page 29) The UTI board of directors believes that the
merger is fair to you and in your best interests, and it unanimously recommends
that you vote for the proposal to adopt the merger agreement and approve the
transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, including the merger.

     Patterson Stockholders.  (Page 36) The Patterson board of directors
believes that the merger is fair to you and in your best interests, and it
recommends that you vote for the proposal to adopt the merger agreement and
approve the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, including the
merger, and for the respective proposals to amend Patterson's restated
certificate of incorporation to increase the number of shares of authorized
Patterson common stock and to change Patterson's name. One of Patterson's board
members abstained from voting on these matters due to his belief that he did not
have sufficient information and time to make an informed decision.

  OPINIONS OF FINANCIAL ADVISORS

     In deciding to recommend the merger, our boards of directors considered
opinions from our respective financial advisors.

     UTI Financial Advisor.  (Page 30) UTI's board of directors received a
written opinion from its financial advisor, Lehman Brothers Inc., to the effect
that as of the date of the opinion, the exchange ratio of one share of Patterson
common stock for each share of UTI common stock is fair to holders of UTI common
stock from a financial point of view. We have attached this opinion dated
February 4, 2001, as Annex B to this document. You should carefully read this
opinion to understand the procedures followed, assumptions made, matters
considered and limitations of the review undertaken.

     Lehman Brothers' opinion is addressed to the UTI board of directors and
does not constitute a recommendation to any stockholder as to how any
stockholder should vote in connection with the merger proposal.

     Patterson Financial Advisor.  (Page 36) Patterson's board of directors
received a written opinion from its financial advisor, Merrill Lynch & Co., to
the effect that as of the date of the opinion, the

exchange ratio of one share of Patterson common stock for each share of UTI
common stock is fair to the Patterson stockholders from a financial point of
view. We have attached the opinion dated February 4, 2001, as Annex C to this
document. You should carefully read this opinion to understand the procedures
followed, assumptions made, matters considered and limitations of the review
undertaken.

     Merrill Lynch's opinion is addressed to the Patterson board of directors
and does not constitute a recommendation to any stockholder as to how any
stockholder should vote in connection with the merger proposal.

  BOARD OF DIRECTORS AND MANAGEMENT OF PATTERSON-UTI FOLLOWING THE MERGER (PAGE
43)

     If the merger agreement is adopted and the transactions contemplated by the
merger agreement, including the merger, are approved, the number of directors
comprising the full board of directors of Patterson-UTI will be increased to 11
members, with six members to be designated by the Patterson board and five
members to be designated by the UTI board. These directors will serve until the
2002 annual meeting of Patterson-UTI stockholders or until their respective
successors are elected and qualified. The merger agreement does not specify who
will be Chairman of the Board and the executive officers of Patterson-UTI
following the merger. Formal action with respect to these positions will be
taken by the new UTI-Patterson board of directors promptly following closing of
the merger. At the time that our boards of directors approved the merger
agreement, they anticipated that Mark S. Siegel, Chairman of the Board of UTI,
would be the Chairman of the Board of Patterson-UTI and that Cloyce A. Talbott,
Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer of Patterson, would be the
Chief Executive Officer of Patterson-UTI.

  CONDITIONS TO COMPLETION OF THE MERGER (PAGE 52)

     Completion of the merger depends on a number of conditions being satisfied
or waived. In addition to customary conditions relating to the accuracy of
representations and warranties and our compliance with the terms of the merger
agreement, these conditions include the following:

     - the merger agreement and the merger have been approved and adopted by
       UTI's stockholders and Patterson's stockholders, and the amendment to
       Patterson's restated certificate of incorporation to authorize additional
       shares of Patterson common stock has been approved by Patterson's
       stockholders;

     - any applicable waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust
       Improvements Act of 1976 relating to the merger has expired or has been
       terminated;

     - no governmental entity or federal, state or foreign court of competent
       jurisdiction has enacted, issued, promulgated, enforced or entered any
       order or statute, rule or regulation that is in effect and that has the
       effect of making the merger illegal or otherwise prohibiting the
       consummation of the merger; and

     - Patterson and UTI each has received an opinion of tax counsel to the
       effect that the merger will be treated for federal income tax purposes as
       a tax-free reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the
       Internal Revenue Code.

  TERMINATION OF THE MERGER (PAGE 52)

     We can agree at any time to terminate the merger agreement without
completing the merger, even if UTI and Patterson stockholders have approved the
merger and Patterson stockholders also have approved the amendment to
Patterson's restated certificate of incorporation to increase the authorized
shares of Patterson common stock. Also, the merger agreement can be terminated
under various circumstances, including the following:

     - by UTI and Patterson, at any time prior to the effective time of the
       merger, with the mutual written consent of our respective boards of
       directors;

     - by either of us, if the merger has not been completed by June 30, 2001,
       except that the right to terminate the merger agreement under this
       provision is not available to any party whose failure to fulfill any of
       its obligations under the merger agreement was the cause of or resulted
       in the failure of the merger to occur on or before June 30, 2001;
       provided, that if either of us determines that additional time is
       necessary in connection with obtaining any governmental consents, that
       date may be extended by either of us to August 31, 2001;

     - by either of us, if any order permanently restraining, enjoining or
       otherwise prohibiting consummation of the merger shall become final and
       nonappealable;

     - by either of us, if, at UTI's stockholders' meeting, UTI does not obtain
       the requisite vote of its stockholders in favor of the merger, or if, at
       Patterson's stockholders' meeting, the requisite vote approving the
       merger agreement and merger or the amendment to Patterson's restated
       certificate of incorporation to increase the authorized shares of common
       stock is not obtained;

     - by either of us, if, there has been a breach of any representation,
       warranty, covenant or agreement set forth in the merger agreement on the
       part of the other party, which breach cannot be cured and would cause the
       closing conditions relating to our respective representations and
       warranties and performance of our respective obligations not to be
       satisfied;

     - by UTI, if the board of directors of UTI authorizes UTI to enter into a
       written agreement relating to a transaction that UTI's board of directors
       has determined is a superior proposal compared to the merger, so long as
       UTI is not in material breach of its obligation not to solicit other
       merger proposals and so long as UTI's stockholders have not approved the
       merger, except that this right to terminate is not available to UTI until
       the expiration of five business days after Patterson's receipt of written
       notice advising that UTI has received a superior proposal and attaching
       the most current version of such agreement, and the failure on the part
       of Patterson to submit an offer that the UTI board determines in good
       faith to be at least as favorable to the UTI stockholders as the superior
       proposal;

     - by Patterson, if the board of directors of Patterson authorizes Patterson
       to enter into a written agreement relating to a transaction that the
       Patterson board of directors has determined is a superior proposal
       compared to the merger, so long as Patterson is not in material breach of
       its obligation not to solicit other merger proposals and so long as
       Patterson's stockholders have not approved the merger, except that the
       right to terminate is not available to Patterson until the expiration of
       five business days after UTI's receipt of written notice advising that
       Patterson has received a superior proposal and attaching the most current
       version of such agreement, and the failure on the part of UTI to submit
       an offer that the Patterson board determines in good faith to be at least
       as favorable to the Patterson stockholders as the superior proposal;

     - by Patterson, if the merger is not approved by the UTI stockholders and
       Patterson is not in breach of the merger agreement, Patterson has not
       entered into a superior proposal and its board of directors has not
       withdrawn, modified or failed to confirm its recommendation of the merger
       within five business days after a written request from UTI to do so; and

     - by UTI, if the merger is not approved by the Patterson stockholders and
       UTI is not in breach of the merger agreement and UTI has not entered into
       a superior proposal and its board of directors has not withdrawn,
       modified or failed to confirm its recommendation of the merger within
       five business days after a written request from Patterson to do so.

  TERMINATION FEES (PAGE 53)

     Patterson must pay UTI a termination fee of $32.5 million and up to $2.5
million of the costs and expenses incurred by UTI in connection with the merger
agreement, if Patterson enters into a binding agreement for a superior proposal
and has complied with the terms of the merger agreement, or, if an acquisition
proposal has been made to Patterson and the merger agreement is terminated by
either UTI or

Patterson because of the failure to obtain approval of the merger by Patterson's
stockholders at the Patterson stockholders' meeting.

     Similarly, UTI must pay Patterson a termination fee of $32.5 million and up
to $2.5 million of the costs and expenses incurred by Patterson in connection
with the merger agreement, if UTI enters into a binding agreement for a superior
proposal and has complied with the terms of the merger agreement, or, if an
acquisition proposal has been made to UTI and the merger agreement is terminated
by either Patterson or UTI because of the failure to obtain approval of the
merger by UTI's stockholders at the UTI stockholders' meeting.

     Patterson must pay UTI a termination fee of $2.5 million and up to $2.5
million of costs and expenses incurred by UTI in connection with the merger
agreement, if Patterson stockholders do not approve the merger and the amendment
to Patterson's restated certificate of incorporation increasing the authorized
shares of Patterson common stock, and UTI is not otherwise in default under the
merger agreement or has not entered into an agreement for a superior proposal.

     UTI must pay Patterson a termination fee of $2.5 million and up to $2.5
million of costs and expenses incurred by Patterson in connection with the
merger agreement if UTI stockholders do not approve the merger, and Patterson is
not otherwise in default under the merger agreement or has not entered into an
agreement for a superior proposal.

  ACCOUNTING TREATMENT (PAGE 42)

     We intend to account for the merger as a pooling-of-interests for financial
reporting purposes. Under this method of accounting, the recorded assets and
liabilities of Patterson and UTI will be carried forward to Patterson-UTI, the
combined company, at their historical amounts, and income of Patterson-UTI will
include income of Patterson and UTI for the entire fiscal year in which the
merger occurs as well as for prior periods.

  INTERESTS OF CERTAIN PERSONS IN THE MERGER THAT ARE DIFFERENT FROM YOUR
INTERESTS (PAGE 41)

     Patterson.  All employee stock options outstanding under Patterson's 1993
stock incentive plan, including those held by the executive officers of
Patterson, will vest at closing of the merger, due to the change in control
provisions in the plan.

     UTI.  All outstanding stock options held by Mark Siegel, Vaughn Drum, John
Vollmer and Bruce Sauers, executive officers of UTI, and one of UTI's directors,
Kenneth Berns, will vest at the closing of the merger due to change of control
provisions in their respective option agreements. In addition, four other UTI
employees hold stock options to purchase an aggregate of less than 65,000 shares
of UTI common stock that will vest at the closing of the merger.

     Three of UTI's directors and officers, Messrs. Siegel, Berns and Vollmer,
have employment arrangements with UTI that also will entitle them to receive a
payment equal to one year's salary upon a change of control in UTI and the
cessation of their employment arrangements. UTI's President and Chief Executive
Officer, Vaughn E. Drum, has an employment agreement with UTI that provides that
if his employment is terminated without cause (as that term is defined in his
employment agreement) or if he voluntarily terminates his employment within one
year of an adverse change (a significant reduction of his authority, duties or
responsibilities, his removal from office, a reduction in his salary or material
reduction in benefits, or a transfer without his consent to a location greater
than 40 miles from his previous work location), he would receive compensation
comprising one year's salary, up to one-half of one year's salary as separation
pay, vacation pay, any bonus, full vesting of all of his interests under benefit
plans and continuation of his benefits.

  APPRAISAL RIGHTS (PAGE 43)

     Under Delaware law, neither the Patterson stockholders nor the UTI
stockholders are entitled to appraisal rights in connection with the merger.

  CERTAIN UNITED STATES FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSEQUENCES (PAGE 44)

     A condition to each party's obligation to complete the merger is receipt of
an opinion from its tax counsel that the merger will qualify as a reorganization
within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as
amended. These opinions will be based on customary assumptions and
representations made by Patterson and UTI. If any of these assumptions or
representations are inaccurate, the tax consequences of the merger could differ
from those described below. An opinion of counsel represents counsel's best
legal judgment and is not binding on the Internal Revenue Service or any court.
No ruling has been, or will be, sought from the Internal Revenue Service as to
the U.S. federal income tax consequences of the merger.

     UTI Stockholders and UTI.  If the merger is classified as a reorganization
within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code, a holder of
shares of UTI common stock generally will not recognize any gain or loss for
U.S. federal income tax purposes on the exchange of shares of UTI common stock
for shares of Patterson common stock, and UTI will not recognize gain or loss
for U.S. federal income tax purposes.

     The U.S. federal income tax consequences described above may not apply to
some holders of shares of UTI common stock, including some types of holders
specifically referred to on page 44.

     Patterson Stockholders and Patterson.  Patterson and holders of shares of
Patterson common stock will not recognize any gain or loss for U.S. federal
income tax purposes.

     Your tax consequences will depend on your specific situation. You should
consult your own tax advisor for a full understanding of the tax consequences of
the merger to you.

  CERTAIN DIFFERENCES IN THE RIGHTS OF STOCKHOLDERS (PAGE 85)

     As a result of the merger, the stockholders of UTI will become stockholders
of Patterson. Upon consummation of the merger, these rights of UTI stockholders
will continue to be governed by the Delaware General Corporation Law, but their
rights will also be governed by Patterson's restated certificate of
incorporation and bylaws. See page 85 for summaries of certain material
differences between the rights of Patterson stockholders and UTI stockholders.

  REGULATORY APPROVALS (PAGE 42)

     Under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, we may not
complete the merger unless Patterson, UTI and REMY Capital Partners III, L.P., a
stockholder of UTI, file Notification and Report Forms with the Antitrust
Division of the Department of Justice and the U.S. Federal Trade Commission and
certain waiting periods expire or terminate. On February 22, 2001, Patterson,
UTI and REMY Capital submitted the required filings to the Federal Trade
Commission and the Antitrust Division. The waiting period under the
Hart-Scott-Rodino Act will expire on March 26, 2001, unless each party receives
early termination of the waiting period before that time. The waiting period
under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act may be extended by receipt of a request for
additional information or documentary material from either the Antitrust
Division or the Federal Trade Commission until the expiration of 30 days after
both Patterson and UTI are in substantial compliance with that request (unless
the extended waiting period is terminated early). We cannot predict whether the
Federal Trade Commission or the Antitrust Division will challenge the merger on
antitrust grounds, or, if such a challenge is made, what the result will be.

  COMPARATIVE PER SHARE MARKET PRICE INFORMATION (PAGE 18)

     Patterson's common stock is quoted on the Nasdaq National Market and UTI's
common stock is listed on the American Stock Exchange. On February 2, 2001, the
last full trading day prior to public announcement of the merger, Patterson's
common stock closed at $36.00 per share and the UTI common stock closed at
$33.10 per share. On           , 2001, the most recent practicable date prior to
mailing this

document, Patterson's common stock closed at $     per share and the UTI common
stock closed at $     per share.

     Although the exchange ratio is fixed, the market price of Patterson common
stock will fluctuate prior to and after the merger. We urge you to obtain
current market quotations before making any decision with respect to the merger.

(1) Over the five years presented, UTI's rig fleet has increased by 89 land
    drilling rigs. This increase in land drilling rigs is the primary cause for
    the increase in revenue, gross profit, selling, general and administrative
    expenses, depreciation and amortization and total assets. The net change in
    land

    drilling rigs owned was 19 during 2000, 16 during 1999, 20 during 1998, 24
    during 1997 and 10 during 1996.

(2) UTI recognized a $2.8 million gain from the sale of land drilling assets in
    the first quarter of 1999.

(3) In October of 1997, UTI sold approximately 3.6 million shares of its common
    stock in a public offering. Approximately another 3.4 million shares of UTI
    common stock were sold by various shareholders of UTI through the exercise
    of options and warrants. Both of these events resulted in net proceeds to
    UTI of approximately $80 million.

     The following table sets forth selected historical consolidated financial
and operating data of Patterson as of and for each of the years in the five-year
period ended December 31, 2000. We have derived this data from the information
Patterson provided in its annual report on Form 10-K filed for the fiscal year
ended December 31, 2000. You should read this data along with the historical
consolidated financial statements and related notes in that report by Patterson

(1) Over the five years presented, Patterson's rig fleet has increased by 104
    land drilling rigs. This increase in land drilling rigs is the primary cause
    for the increase in revenue, gross profit, selling,

general and administrative expenses, depreciation and amortization and total
assets. The net change in land drilling rigs owned was 12 during 2000, five
during 1999, 15 during 1998, 38 during 1997 and 34 during 1996.

(2) Patterson incurred $2.3 of non-recurring acquisition costs associated with
    its merger with Tucker Drilling Company, Inc. during 1996.

(3) In 1997 and 2000, Patterson sold 7.1 million shares and three million
    shares, respectively, of its common stock in two public offerings. These two
    offerings resulted in net proceeds to Patterson of approximately $59.4
    million and $98.8 million in 1997 and 2000, respectively.

              SELECTED UNAUDITED PRO FORMA COMBINED FINANCIAL DATA
                                OF PATTERSON-UTI

     The following tables set forth selected unaudited pro forma combined
financial data to give effect to the merger between Patterson and UTI based on
the pooling-of-interests method of accounting at the exchange ratio of one share
of Patterson common stock for each share of UTI common stock. The unaudited pro
forma balance sheet data included in the tables below are presented as if the
merger was effective on December 31, 2000. The unaudited pro forma statement of
operations data included in the tables below are presented as though the merger
was effective as of January 1, 1998. The pro forma amounts in the tables below
are presented for informational purposes. You should not rely on the pro forma
amounts as being indicative of the financial position or the results of
operations of the combined company that would have actually occurred had the
merger been effective during the periods presented or of the future financial
position or future results of operations of the combined company. The unaudited
pro forma combined statements of operations exclude non-recurring charges
directly attributable to the merger (estimated at $10 million), substantially
all of which will be charged to operations in the quarter in which the merger is
consummated. The unaudited pro forma combined balance sheet has been adjusted to
reflect the assumed after-tax impact of such non-recurring charges. You should
read this information in conjunction with the historical consolidated financial
statements and accompanying notes of Patterson and UTI incorporated in this
document by reference and the condensed unaudited pro forma combined financial
statements and notes beginning on page 79.

(1) The unaudited equivalent pro forma per share data is calculated by
    multiplying the unaudited pro forma combined per share data by the exchange
    ratio of one share of Patterson common stock for each share of UTI common
    stock.

(2) Historical book value per share is computed by dividing stockholders' equity
    by the number of shares of common stock outstanding at the end of the
    period.

                                  RISK FACTORS

     In deciding whether to approve the merger between UTI and Patterson, you
should consider all of the information we have included in this document and its
annexes and all of the information we have included in the documents we have
incorporated by reference. See "Where You Can Find More Information" on page 94.
In addition, you should pay particular attention to the following risks related
to the merger:

WE MAY NOT REALIZE THE BENEFITS OF INTEGRATING THE TWO COMPANIES.

     In deciding that the merger is in the best interests of our respective
stockholders, the Patterson board of directors and the UTI board of directors
considered the potential complementary effects of combining the two companies'
assets, personnel and operational expertise. Integrating businesses, however,
involves a number of special risks, including the possibility that management
may be distracted from regular business concerns by the need to integrate
operations, unforeseen difficulties in integrating operations and systems,
problems concerning retaining and assimilating the employees of the combined
company, challenges in retaining customers, and potential adverse short-term or
long-term effects on operating results. If we cannot integrate our businesses
successfully, we may fail to realize the benefits we expect to realize from the
merger, including cost savings.

THE MARKET VALUE OF SHARES OF PATTERSON COMMON STOCK THAT UTI STOCKHOLDERS
RECEIVE IN THE MERGER WILL VARY AS A RESULT OF THE FIXED EXCHANGE RATIO AND
POSSIBLE STOCK PRICE FLUCTUATIONS.

     The exchange ratio is a fixed ratio that will not be adjusted as a result
of any increase or decrease in the price of either shares of Patterson common
stock or shares of UTI common stock. The prices of Patterson common stock and
UTI common stock at the time the merger is completed may be higher or lower than
their price on the date of this document or on the date of the special meetings
of UTI stockholders and Patterson stockholders. Changes in the business,
operations or prospects of Patterson or UTI, market assessments of the benefits
of the merger and of the likelihood that the merger will be completed,
regulatory considerations, oil and gas prices, general market and economic
conditions, or other factors may affect the prices of Patterson common stock or
UTI common stock. Most of these factors are beyond our control.

     Because the merger will be completed only after the special meetings of our
respective stockholders are held, there is no way to be sure that the price of
the Patterson common stock now, or on the date of the special meetings, will be
indicative of its price at the time the merger is completed. We urge you to
obtain current market quotations for both shares of Patterson common stock and
shares of UTI common stock.

SIGNIFICANT CHARGES AND EXPENSES WILL BE INCURRED AS A RESULT OF THE MERGER.

     We expect to incur approximately $10 million of costs related to the
merger. These expenses will include, investment banking fees, legal and
accounting fees, printing costs, regulatory filing fees, transition and
integration costs and other related charges. We may also incur unanticipated
costs in the merger.

A SUBSTANTIAL OR EXTENDED DECLINE IN OIL OR GAS PRICES WOULD HAVE A MATERIAL
ADVERSE EFFECT ON PATTERSON-UTI.

     Prices for oil and natural gas fluctuate widely. Among the factors that can
cause these price fluctuations are:

     - level of consumer demand,

     - weather conditions,

     - price and availability of alternative fuels,

     - domestic and Canadian drilling activity, and

     - overall economic conditions.

     Due to the many uncertainties associated with the world political
environment, the availability of other worldwide energy supplies and the
relative competitive relationships of the various energy sources in the view of
consumers, we are unable to predict what changes may occur in oil and natural
gas prices in the future.

     Our cash flow and earnings depend to a great extent on the prevailing
prices for oil and natural gas. Prolonged or substantial declines in these
commodity prices may adversely affect our liquidity, the amount of cash flow
available for capital expenditures, and our ability to maintain our credit
quality and access to the credit and capital markets.

PATTERSON-UTI WILL HAVE HIGHER LEVELS OF INDEBTEDNESS THAN EITHER PATTERSON OR
UTI HAD BEFORE THE MERGER.

     You should consider that Patterson-UTI would have higher levels of debt and
interest expense than either company on a stand-alone basis. The level of
combined indebtedness after the merger may have an effect on our future
operations, including:

     - A portion of Patterson-UTI's cash flow will be used to pay interest and
       principal on debt and will not be available for other purposes;

     - Patterson-UTI's credit facilities may contain financial tests that it
       must satisfy in order to continue to borrow funds under the facilities.
       Failure to meet these tests may be a default under the credit facilities;
       and

     - Patterson-UTI may be unable to adjust rapidly to changing market
       conditions.

ANTI-TAKEOVER MEASURES IN PATTERSON'S CHARTER DOCUMENTS AND UNDER STATE LAW
COULD DISCOURAGE AN ACQUISITION OF PATTERSON-UTI AND THEREBY ADVERSELY AFFECT
THE RELATED PURCHASE PRICE.

     Patterson, as a Delaware corporation, is subject to the Delaware General
Corporation Law, including Section 203, an anti-takeover law enacted in 1988.
Patterson has also enacted certain anti-takeover measures, including a
stockholders' rights plan. In addition, Patterson's board of directors has the
authority to issue up to one million shares of preferred stock and to determine
the price, rights (including voting rights), conversion ratios, preferences and
privileges of that stock without further vote or action by the holders of its
common stock. As a result of these measures and the rights plan described below,
potential acquirers of Patterson-UTI may find it more difficult or be
discouraged from attempting to effect an acquisition transaction with us. This
could deprive holders of Patterson-UTI securities of certain opportunities to
sell or otherwise dispose of such securities at above-market prices and could
discourage transactions involving actual and potential changes of control,
including transactions that otherwise could result in a payment of a premium
over prevailing market prices to Patterson-UTI stockholders for shares of
Patterson-UTI common stock.

     Patterson's board of directors adopted a stockholders' rights plan in
January 1997. The existence of the rights plan may impede a takeover of
Patterson not supported by Patterson-UTI's board of directors, including a
proposed takeover that may be desired by a majority of our stockholders or
result in a payment of a premium over the prevailing market price of
Patterson-UTI common stock.

       and Patterson are greater than expected;

     - fluctuations in worldwide prices and demand for oil and gas;

     - fluctuations in levels of oil and gas exploration and development
       activities;

     - fluctuations in the demand for contract drilling services;

     - the existence of competitors;

     - technological changes and developments in the industry;

     - the existence of regulatory uncertainties; and

     - the risks discussed under "Risk Factors."

                                   THE MERGER

BACKGROUND OF THE MERGER

     On January 19, 2001, Mr. Siegel called Mr. Talbott to inquire as to Mr.
Talbott's availability during the week of January 29 to discuss a possible
combination of Patterson and UTI. Mr. Talbott indicated that he would be
available that week.

     On January 26, 2001, the UTI board of directors held a telephonic meeting
at which Mr. Siegel advised the board that he had called Mr. Talbott to set up a
meeting. The UTI board discussed the desirability of a combination with
Patterson and unanimously endorsed Mr. Siegel's meeting with Mr. Talbott.

     On January 29, 2001, Mr. Siegel called Mr. Talbott and recommended that
they meet beginning on Thursday, February 1, 2001, and work continuously to see
if a combination between the two companies were possible. Mr. Talbott agreed to
meet on Thursday morning, February 1, 2001.

     On January 29, 2001, Mr. Talbott called a Patterson telephonic board
meeting to report that Mr. Siegel had contacted him and suggested that
negotiations begin regarding a possible merger of Patterson and UTI. The board
authorized Mr. Talbott to begin negotiations with Mr. Siegel and report back to
the board with results of the negotiations.

     On January 30 and 31, 2001, Messrs. Siegel and Talbott discussed certain
procedural matters by telephone.

     On February 1, 2001, Messrs. Siegel, Berns and Talbott met in the early
morning at a hotel in Dallas, Texas to discuss a possible merger of equals.
Messrs. Talbott, Siegel and Berns met continuously on February 1 and 2. After
extensive discussion, they agreed that a combination would be beneficial to each
of the companies and their stockholders and decided to apprise their respective
boards of the substance of their negotiations and their recommendation to move
forward toward negotiating a definitive merger agreement.

     On February 2, 2001, Mr. Talbott called a telephonic board meeting at 10:00
a.m. to update the Patterson board on the status of negotiations and seek
guidance from the board on whether he should continue negotiating a possible
combination of the two companies. He informed the board that he and Mr. Siegel
believed that a combination of the two companies would be beneficial to both
companies and their stockholders. Following Mr. Talbott's report, management of
Patterson presented to its board a financial analysis of a combined
Patterson-UTI. The Patterson board discussed various issues relating to the
merger including the strategic value of the merger to Patterson and its
stockholders, management of the combined company, the exchange ratio and the
composition of the board of the combined company.

     After extensive discussion, the board instructed Mr. Talbott to continue
negotiations with Mr. Siegel on the basis of a merger of Patterson and UTI with
the following terms:

     - Patterson's stockholders would own greater than 50% of the combined
       companies after the merger.

     - Patterson's board would hold a one seat majority of the board after the
       merger, and

     - Mr. Talbott would continue to be chief executive officer of Patterson
       after the merger.

     At a telephonic board meeting commencing at 1:30 p.m., on February 2, 2001,
Messrs. Siegel and Berns provided the UTI board of directors with an update on
the status of the negotiations of a possible business combination with
Patterson. The UTI board of directors indicated its support for a merger and its
belief that the exchange ratio should be close to one to one. The UTI board
directed Messrs. Siegel and Berns to continue negotiations with Patterson.

     After both board meetings, Messrs. Talbott, Siegel and Berns continued
negotiations, and management of both companies began negotiating and drafting a
merger agreement for approval by their respective boards.

     Following negotiations on February 3 and 4, 2001, Messrs. Talbott, Siegel
and Berns, management of the respective companies and their counsel negotiated
the following terms of a merger:

     - UTI would merge into Patterson and Patterson would change its name to
       Patterson-UTI Energy, Inc.;

     - each UTI stockholder would receive one share of Patterson stock for each
       of its outstanding shares, which would result in Patterson stockholders
       owning approximately 50.5% and UTI stockholders owning approximately
       49.5% of the combined Patterson-UTI immediately after the merger,

     - Patterson's board would choose six members and UTI's board would choose
       the remaining five members of the combined Patterson-UTI board.

     It was further understood that after consummation of the merger, Mr. Siegel
would serve as Chairman while Mr. Talbott would serve as Chief Executive Officer
of a combined Patterson-UTI.

     At a telephonic board meeting commencing at 5:30 p.m. on February 4, 2001,
Mr. Siegel advised the UTI board of directors that management of UTI had
negotiated the terms of a definitive merger agreement with representatives of
Patterson, subject to the approval of the UTI board of directors. UTI's legal
counsel reviewed the material terms of the merger agreement with the UTI board
of directors. Also, at the board meeting Lehman Brothers made a presentation to
the UTI board of directors with regard to the reasons supporting the merger and
the financial impact to UTI and its stockholders. At the conclusion of the
presentation, Lehman Brothers advised the UTI board of directors that it would
issue its fairness opinion as of the date of the meeting, subject to the UTI
board of directors' approval of the merger. After discussion, the UTI board of
directors unanimously approved the merger agreement.

     On the evening of February 4, 2001, Patterson's board of directors convened
via telephone to review the progress of the proposed merger transaction with
UTI. Mr. Talbott and other members of Patterson's management team and
Patterson's legal counsel briefed the board on the results of the negotiations.
In addition, Patterson's senior management briefed the board as to the strategic
rationales for the transaction and Patterson's counsel reviewed the proposed
terms of the transaction and the merger agreement.

     Following the presentation of the terms of the merger, Merrill Lynch,
financial advisor to the Patterson board on this transaction, delivered its
fairness opinion presentation to the Patterson board, in which it gave its
opinion that, as of that date and based on and subject to the matters described
in its opinion, the exchange ratio was fair, from a financial point of view, to
Patterson and its stockholders.

     At the conclusion of the meeting, Patterson's board, with one member
abstaining, determined that the merger agreement and merger transactions were
fair to, and in the best interests of, Patterson and its stockholders, and
resolved to recommend that Patterson's stockholders adopt the merger agreement
and approve the merger and an amendment to Patterson's restated certificate of
incorporation increasing the number of authorized shares of common stock from
50,000,000 to 200,000,000 and change the name of Patterson to Patterson-UTI
Energy, Inc.

     Following execution of the definitive merger agreement, a joint press
release announcing the merger transaction was issued on February 5, 2001.

UTI'S REASONS FOR THE MERGER

     UTI's board of directors believes that the terms of the merger are in the
best interests of UTI and its stockholders, has unanimously approved the merger
and the merger agreement and recommends that the UTI stockholders approve and
adopt the merger and merger agreement.

     UTI's board of directors considers the merger to be a means of achieving
the long term strategic and financial goals of UTI while at the same time
offering the UTI stockholders the ability to participate in a

larger, more diversified land drilling company. In reaching its conclusion to
approve the merger, the UTI board of directors also considered the factors
listed below:

     - information concerning the historical financial performance and
       condition, business operations and prospects of each of UTI and
       Patterson, and UTI's projected future performance and prospects as a
       separate entity and on a combined basis with Patterson;

     - current industry, economic and market conditions;

     - the fact that the combination of the two companies would create the
       second largest drilling company in the United States and that the
       geographic locations, strengths and drilling rig fleets of UTI and
       Patterson complement one another;

     - the fact that the size and importance in the industry of the combined
       companies likely would provide greater visibility and a stronger
       following by research analysts and greater stock market liquidity than
       UTI would have on its own;

     - recent and historical market prices of UTI's common stock and Patterson's
       common stock;

     - the structure of the transaction and terms of the merger agreement and
       the one to one exchange ratio, which were the result of arm's-length
       negotiations between UTI and Patterson;

     - the financial analysis and opinion of Lehman Brothers;

     - the fact that the merger would provide holders of UTI common stock with
       the opportunity to receive a premium over recent market prices for UTI
       common stock;

     - the terms of the merger agreement that permit the UTI board of directors,
       in the exercise of its fiduciary duties and subject to certain
       conditions, to terminate the merger agreement if UTI receives a takeover
       proposal that the UTI board of directors deems to be a "superior
       proposal" (as defined in the merger agreement); in this regard, the UTI
       board of directors noted that if it were to terminate the merger
       agreement under those circumstances, UTI must pay to Patterson a $32.5
       million fee plus reimbursement of expenses up to $2.5 million, and if the
       UTI stockholders did not approve the merger and UTI had not received a
       superior takeover proposal, UTI must pay to Patterson a $2.5 million fee
       plus reimbursement of expenses up to $2.5 million; the UTI board of
       directors did not view the termination fee provision of the merger
       agreement as unreasonably deterring any seriously interested third party
       from making a superior proposal;

     - the expectation that the merger would result in the holders of UTI common
       stock receiving the opportunity to receive shares of Patterson common
       stock in a transaction that is not expected to have any immediate United
       States federal income tax impact;

     - the expectation that the merger of UTI and Patterson will be treated for
       accounting purposes as a pooling-of-interests;

     - the historical performance and reputation of Patterson; and

     - the likelihood that the merger would be consummated.

     In determining that the merger was in the best interests of UTI's
stockholders, the UTI board of directors considered the factors discussed above
as a whole and did not assign specific or relative weights to those factors. The
UTI board of directors believes that the merger is an opportunity for UTI's
stockholders to participate in a combined enterprise that has significantly
greater business and financial resources than UTI would have without the merger
and to receive, on a tax deferred basis, a premium for their shares of UTI
common stock, based on recent market prices.

RECOMMENDATION OF THE UTI BOARD OF DIRECTORS

     For the reasons set forth under "The Merger -- Background of the Merger"
and "The Merger -- UTI's Reasons for the Merger," the UTI board of directors
believes that the merger is in the best interests

of UTI and the holders of UTI common stock. THE UTI BOARD OF DIRECTORS
UNANIMOUSLY ADOPTED THE MERGER AND THE MERGER AGREEMENT AND RECOMMENDS THAT THE
HOLDERS OF UTI COMMON STOCK VOTE "FOR" ADOPTION OF THE MERGER AND THE MERGER
AGREEMENT.

OPINION OF UTI'S FINANCIAL ADVISOR

     Lehman Brothers acted as UTI's financial advisor in connection with the
merger. UTI instructed Lehman Brothers, in its role as financial advisor, to
evaluate the fairness, from a financial perspective, of the exchange ratio
offered to UTI stockholders in the merger. On February 4, 2001, Lehman Brothers
delivered its oral and written opinion to the UTI board that, as of such date
and based upon and subject to certain matters stated therein, from a financial
point of view, the exchange ratio offered to UTI's stockholders in the merger
was fair to such stockholders.

     THE FULL TEXT OF THE LEHMAN BROTHERS' WRITTEN OPINION IS INCLUDED IN ANNEX
B TO THIS JOINT PROXY STATEMENT/PROSPECTUS, AND IS INCORPORATED HEREIN BY
REFERENCE. UTI STOCKHOLDERS MAY READ LEHMAN BROTHERS' OPINION FOR A DISCUSSION
OF THE ASSUMPTIONS MADE, FACTORS CONSIDERED AND LIMITATIONS UPON THE REVIEW
UNDERTAKEN BY LEHMAN BROTHERS IN RENDERING ITS OPINION. THE FOLLOWING IS SUMMARY
OF THE MATERIAL PROVISIONS OF LEHMAN BROTHERS' OPINION AND IS QUALIFIED IN ITS
ENTIRETY BY REFERENCE TO SUCH OPINION.

     Except as described in the next sentence, no limitations were imposed by
UTI on the scope of Lehman Brothers' investigation or the procedures to be
followed by Lehman Brothers in rendering its opinion. In arriving at its
opinion, at the direction of UTI, Lehman Brothers had limited opportunity to
conduct due diligence on UTI and Patterson and, as further described below,
Lehman Brothers' opinion therefore was necessarily based primarily upon publicly
available information. The form and amount of the consideration to be received
by UTI stockholders in the merger was determined through arm's-length
negotiations between the parties. Lehman Brothers' advisory services and opinion
were provided for the use and benefit of the UTI board in connection with its
consideration of the merger. Lehman Brothers' opinion is not intended to be and
does not constitute a recommendation to any UTI stockholder as to how such
stockholder should vote with respect to the merger. Lehman Brothers was not
requested to opine as to, and its opinion does not address, UTI's underlying
business decision to proceed with the merger. In addition, Lehman Brothers'
opinion does not address the prices at which shares of Patterson common stock
will actually trade after the merger.

     In arriving at its opinion, Lehman Brothers reviewed and analyzed the
following:

     - the merger agreement and the specific terms of the merger (including with
       respect to corporate governance of the combined company);

     - publicly available information concerning UTI and Patterson that Lehman
       Brothers believed to be relevant to its analysis, including Annual
       Reports on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 1999 and
       Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2000;

     - a trading history of the common stock of each of UTI and Patterson from
       February 2, 2000 to the present and a comparison of these trading
       histories with each other and with those of other companies that Lehman
       Brothers deemed relevant;

     - a comparison of the historical financial results and present financial
       condition of each of UTI and Patterson with each other and with those of
       other companies that Lehman Brothers deemed relevant;

     - a comparison of the financial terms of the merger with the financial
       terms of certain other transactions that Lehman Brothers deemed relevant;

     - estimates of third party research analysts with respect to the future
       financial performance of each of UTI and Patterson; and

     - the relative contributions of UTI and Patterson to the historical and
       future financial performance of the combined company on a pro forma
       basis.

In addition, Lehman Brothers had discussions with the management of each of UTI
and Patterson concerning their respective businesses, operations, assets,
financial condition and prospects and concerning the strategic benefits expected
to result from the merger and undertook such other studies, analyses and
investigations as it deemed appropriate.

     In arriving at its opinion, Lehman Brothers assumed and relied upon the
accuracy and completeness of the financial and other information used by Lehman
Brothers without assuming any responsibility for independent verification of
such information and further relied upon the assurances of managements of UTI
and Patterson that they are not aware of any facts or circumstances that would
make such information inaccurate or misleading. In arriving at its opinion,
Lehman Brothers did not review financial projections of UTI or Patterson
prepared by management of UTI or Patterson. Based on the advice of UTI, Lehman
Brothers assumed that the published estimates of third party research analysts
are a reasonable basis upon which to evaluate the future financial performance
of UTI and Patterson on a comparative basis. In arriving at its opinion, Lehman
Brothers did not conduct a physical inspection of the properties and facilities
of UTI or Patterson and did not make or obtain any evaluations or appraisals of
the assets or liabilities of UTI or Patterson. In addition, the UTI board did
not authorize Lehman Brothers to solicit, and Lehman Brothers did not solicit,
any proposals or offers from any third party with respect to the purchase of all
or a part of UTI's business. Upon advice of UTI and its legal and accounting
advisors, Lehman Brothers assumed that the merger will qualify (i) for
pooling-of-interests accounting treatment and (ii) as a reorganization within
the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended,
and therefore qualify as a tax-free transaction to the stockholders of UTI.
Lehman Brothers' opinion necessarily was based upon market, economic and other
conditions as they existed on, and could be evaluated as of, the date of its
opinion.

     In arriving at its opinion, Lehman Brothers did not ascribe a specific
range of values to UTI or Patterson, but rather made its determination as to the
fairness, from a financial point of view, of the exchange ratio on the basis of
the financial and comparative analyses described below. The preparation of a
fairness opinion involves various determinations as to the most appropriate and
relevant methods of financial and comparative analysis and the application of
those methods to the particular circumstances. As a result, fairness opinions
are not readily susceptible to summary description. Furthermore, in arriving at
its opinion, Lehman Brothers did not attribute any particular weight to any
analysis or factor considered by it, but rather made qualitative judgments as to
the significance and relevance of each analysis and factor. Accordingly, Lehman
Brothers believes that its analyses must be considered as a whole and that
considering any portion of such analyses and of the factors considered, without
considering all analyses and factors, could create a misleading or incomplete
view of the process underlying its opinion. In performing its analyses, Lehman
Brothers made numerous assumptions with respect to industry performance, general
business and economic conditions and other matters, many of which are beyond the
control of UTI or Patterson. None of UTI, Patterson, Lehman Brothers or any
other person assumes responsibility if future results are materially different
from those discussed. Any estimates contained in the analyses are not
necessarily indicative of actual values or predictive of future results or
values, which may be significantly more or less favorable than as set forth
therein. In addition, analyses relating to the value of businesses do not
purport to be appraisals or to reflect the prices at which businesses may
actually be sold.

     Financial Analyses.  The following is a summary of the material financial
analyses used by Lehman Brothers in connection with providing its opinion to the
UTI board. Certain of the summaries of financial analyses include information
presented in tabular format. In order to fully understand the financial analyses
used by Lehman Brothers, the tables must be read together with the text of each
summary. The tables alone do not constitute a complete description of the
financial and comparative analyses. In particular, you should note that in
applying the various valuation methodologies to the particular businesses,
operations

and prospects of UTI and Patterson, and the particular circumstances of the
merger, Lehman Brothers made qualitative judgments as to the significance and
relevance of each analysis. In addition, Lehman Brothers made numerous
assumptions with respect to industry performance, general business and economic
conditions and other matters, many of which are beyond the control of UTI and
Patterson. Accordingly, analyses and the implied exchange ratios derived
therefrom set forth in the tables and described below must be considered as a
whole. Considering any portion of such analyses, including the implied exchange
ratios set forth in the tables below, and of the factors considered without
considering all analyses, factors and the assumptions underlying these analyses,
could create a misleading or incomplete view of the process underlying, and
conclusions represented by Lehman Brothers' opinion.

                                                                                          IMPLIED

     Comparable Company Trading Analysis.  With respect to UTI and Patterson,
Lehman Brothers reviewed the public stock market trading multiples for selected
domestic U.S. land drilling companies, including, but not limited to, the
following:

     - Grey Wolf, Inc.,

     - Helmerich & Payne Inc.,

     - Key Energy Services, Inc.,

     - Nabors Industries, Inc., and

     - Precision Drilling Corporation.

Using publicly available information, Lehman Brothers calculated and analyzed
the common equity market value multiples of certain projected financial criteria
based upon published analyst estimates, such as net income and discretionary
cash flow. Lehman Brothers also calculated and analyzed the adjusted
capitalization multiples of certain projected financial criteria based upon
published analyst estimates, such as EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes,
depreciation and amortization). The adjusted capitalization of each company was
obtained by adding long-term debt to the sum of the market value of its common
equity, the value of its preferred stock based upon its market value if publicly
traded and its liquidation value if privately held, and the book value of any
minority interest minus the cash balance.

     This methodology yielded an implied exchange ratio range of 0.850 to 0.910.
However, because of the inherent differences between the businesses, operations
and prospects of UTI and Patterson and the companies included in the comparable
companies group, Lehman Brothers believed that it was inappropriate to, and
therefore did not, rely solely on the quantitative results of the analysis.
Accordingly, Lehman Brothers also made qualitative judgments concerning the
differences between the financial and operating characteristics of UTI and
Patterson and the companies in the comparable companies group that would affect
the public trading values of UTI and Patterson and such comparable companies.

     Comparable Acquisitions Analysis.  With respect to UTI and Patterson,
Lehman Brothers reviewed certain publicly available information on selected
domestic U.S. and international transactions which were announced from June of
1994 to September of 2000 including, but not limited to, the following:

     - Schlumberger N.V. (Schlumberger Limited)/Camco International Inc.,

     - Baker Hughes Incorporated/Western Atlas Inc.,

     - Energy Ventures, Inc./Weatherford Enterra, Inc.,

     - Halliburton Company/Dresser Industries, Inc.,

     - National-Oilwell, Inc./Dreco Energy Services, Ltd.,

     - Nabors Industries, Inc./Pool Energy Services Co.,

     - Precision Drilling Corporation/Plains Energy Services Ltd.,

     - Bonus Resource Services Corp./Tetonka Drilling Inc., and

     - Transocean Sedco Forex Inc./R&B Falcon Corporation.

For each transaction, Lehman Brothers calculated an enterprise value multiple
based on the EBITDA during the last twelve month period prior to announcement of
the transaction and equity value multiples based on the one and two year forward
estimated net income.

     The enterprise and equity value multiples were applied to UTI's data points
for each of the above-mentioned statistics adjusting the enterprise value for
the market value of total debt less cash and cash equivalents to calculate an
implied equity value range.

     The comparable acquisitions analysis resulted in an implied exchange ratio
range of 0.850-0.910. However, because the market conditions, rationale and
circumstances surrounding each of the transactions analyzed were specific to
each transaction and because of the inherent differences between the businesses,
operations and prospects of UTI and Patterson and the companies involved in the
transactions analyzed, Lehman Brothers believed that it was inappropriate to,
and therefore did not, rely solely on the quantitative results of the analysis.
Accordingly, Lehman Brothers also made qualitative judgments concerning the
differences between the characteristics of these transactions and the merger
that would affect the equity values of UTI and Patterson and such other
companies.

     Historical Common Stock Trading Analysis.  Lehman Brothers reviewed the
daily historical closing share prices of the UTI and Patterson common stock for
the period from February 2, 2000 to February 2, 2001. Lehman Brothers analyzed
the ratio of the February 2, 2001 closing share price for UTI to the
corresponding closing share price of Patterson. In addition, Lehman Brothers
reviewed the ratio of the closing share prices for UTI and Patterson based on
the 10, 20, 30, 60, 90 and 120 trading day averages as of February 2, 2001.
Based on these average closing prices of the UTI and Patterson common stock,
this analysis implies an exchange ratio range of 0.753 to 0.919.

     Contribution Analysis.  Lehman Brothers utilized historical financial data
provided by UTI and Patterson regarding their land drilling operations to
calculate the relative contributions by UTI and Patterson to the pro forma
combined company with respect to net income and discretionary cash flow for the
calendar year 2000. Lehman Brothers also calculated similar contributions based
on 2001 and 2002 projected net income and discretionary cash flow based on
consensus earnings estimates for both companies as reported by First Call, a
service reporting equity analyst estimates. In all cases, Lehman

Brothers compared UTI's contribution percentages to UTI stockholders' expected
50% pro forma ownership of the combined company. The following table summarizes
the results of this analysis.

                                                     UTI         PATTERSON        IMPLIED

     Premiums Paid Analysis.  With respect to UTI, Lehman Brothers reviewed the
premiums paid in selected domestic U.S. and international oilfield
equipment/services company transactions based upon publicly available
information which were announced from June of 1994 to August of 2000 including,
but not limited to, the following:

     - Schlumberger N.V. (Schlumberger Limited)/Camco,

     - Baker Hughes Incorporated/Western Atlas Inc.,

     - Energy Ventures, Inc./Weatherford Enterra, Inc.,

     - Halliburton Company/Dresser Industries, Inc.,

     - National-Oilwell, Inc./Dreco Energy Services, Ltd.,

     - Camco International Inc./Production Operators Corp.,

     - National-Oilwell, Inc./IRI International Corporation,

     - Precision Drilling Corporation/Plains Energy Services Ltd., and

     - Transocean Sedco Forex Inc./R&B Falcon Corporation.

For each transaction, Lehman Brothers calculated the premium paid to the
stockholders of the acquired company based upon the acquired company's common
stock price one day, one week, four weeks and eight weeks prior to the
announcement date of such transaction.

     The transaction premiums were applied to UTI's data point for each of the
dates specified to obtain a range of values for UTI's common stock. Theses
values were then compared to Patterson's closing common stock price on the last
trading day preceding delivery of Lehman Brothers' opinion to the UTI Board.

     The premiums paid analysis resulted in an implied exchange ratio of 0.830
to 1.110. However, because the market conditions, rationale and circumstances
surrounding each of the transactions analyzed were specific to each transaction
and because of the inherent differences between the businesses, operations and
prospects of UTI and Patterson and the companies involved in the transactions
analyzed, Lehman Brothers believed that it was inappropriate to, and therefore
did not, rely solely on the quantitative results of the analysis. Accordingly,
Lehman Brothers also made qualitative judgments concerning the differences
between the characteristics of these transactions and the merger that would
affect the equity values of UTI and Patterson and such other companies.

     Pro Forma Merger Consequences Analysis.  Lehman Brothers analyzed the pro
forma impact of the merger on UTI's projected earnings per share and
discretionary cash flow per share. Projected net income and discretionary cash
flow for fiscal years 2001 and 2002 was based on third party research estimates
reported by First Call, a service reporting equity analyst estimates. Lehman
Brothers compared the

earnings and discretionary cash flow of UTI on a standalone basis to the
earnings and discretionary cash flow attributable to UTI's respective interests
in pro forma Patterson. The analysis indicated that the merger will be accretive
to UTI's net income and discretionary cash flow per share in 2001 and 2002.

     Lehman Brothers Financial Advisory Fee -- Lehman Brothers is an
internationally recognized investment banking firm engaged in, among other
things, the valuation of businesses and their securities in connection with
mergers and acquisitions, negotiated underwritings, competitive bids, secondary
distributions of listed and unlisted securities, private placements and
valuations for corporate and other purposes. The UTI board selected Lehman
Brothers because of its expertise, reputation and familiarity with UTI in
particular and the oilfield service industry in general and because its
investment banking professionals have substantial experience in transactions
comparable to the merger.

     Pursuant to the terms of an engagement letter dated February 3, 2001,
between Lehman Brothers and UTI, UTI agreed to pay Lehman Brothers a fee of
$2,000,000 upon the delivery of its fairness opinion. UTI also agreed to
reimburse Lehman Brothers for its reasonable expenses incurred in connection
with its engagement, and to indemnify Lehman Brothers and certain related
persons against certain liabilities in connection with its engagement. Lehman
Brothers has previously rendered financial advisory and investment banking
services to UTI for which it has received customary compensation.

     In the ordinary course of its business, Lehman Brothers actively trades in
the equity securities of UTI and Patterson for its own account and for the
accounts of its customers and, accordingly, may at any time hold a long or short
position in such securities.

PATTERSON'S REASONS FOR THE MERGER

     Patterson's board of directors has determined that the merger agreement is
fair to and in the best interest of the stockholders of Patterson. In reaching
its decision to approve the merger agreement, the Patterson board of directors
consulted with Patterson's legal and financial advisors, as well as with
Patterson's management, including the management members of Patterson's board of
directors. The Patterson board of directors considered the following factors:

     - The complementary nature of Patterson's and UTI's respective businesses,
       assets and strategic objectives;

     - The historical financial performance and condition, and operations and
       prospects of Patterson and UTI on a combined basis and of Patterson and
       UTI, as separate entities;

     - Diversification of operations into the prolific oil and natural gas
       regions of Western Canada;

     - Belief that the expected greater visibility and enhanced market
       capitalization of the combined companies following the merger, together
       with the expected increase in stock market liquidity should provide
       opportunity for investment in Patterson-UTI by institutions having more
       purchasing power and more stringent investment policies and practices;

     - Belief that economies of scale and other cost savings obtainable from the
       merger would, if realized, create additional value to Patterson
       stockholders;

     - Belief that the proposed merger would result in improvements in key
       performances indicators including cash flow;

     - Financial presentation to the board of directors and related opinion from
       Patterson's financial advisor to the effect that, as of the date of its
       opinion and based on and subject to the matters described in its opinion,
       the exchange ratio was fair from a financial point of view to Patterson
       and the Patterson stockholders, as more fully described under "Opinion of
       Patterson's Financial Advisor"; and

     - The terms and conditions of the merger agreement and the merger were
       viewed by the Patterson board of directors and management to be fair to
       and in the best interest of Patterson and its stockholders.

     Patterson's board of directors believes that the further expansion of
Patterson's onshore drilling fleet through the merger, the enhancement of
Patterson's financial position and the possible positive impact on
Patterson-UTI's earnings that could result from any consolidation savings
realized in the merger will enhance Patterson's long-term growth potential.

     All combinations, including the merger, include certain risk and
disadvantages. Material potential risks associated with the merger are discussed
in "Risk Factors" commencing on page 19 of this document. You are urged to
review that section.

RECOMMENDATIONS OF THE PATTERSON BOARD OF DIRECTORS

     After consideration of the factors discussed above, and without weight to
any specific factor, the members of Patterson's board of directors voting on the
merger and the proposed amendments to Patterson's restated certificate of
incorporation, have determined that the terms of the merger are fair to and in
the best interest of Patterson and the Patterson stockholders.

     THE PATTERSON BOARD RECOMMENDS THAT PATTERSON STOCKHOLDERS VOTE AT THE
PATTERSON SPECIAL STOCKHOLDER MEETING TO ADOPT THE MERGER AGREEMENT AND THE
MERGER AND THE AMENDMENT TO PATTERSON'S RESTATED CERTIFICATE OF INCORPORATION TO
INCREASE THE AUTHORIZED SHARES OF PATTERSON'S COMMON STOCK AND THE AMENDMENT TO
PATTERSON'S RESTATED CERTIFICATE OF INCORPORATION FOR THE NAME CHANGE.

     One of the Patterson board members abstained from voting on the merger and
the charter amendments, because he believed that he lacked sufficient
information and time to make an informed decision.

OPINION OF PATTERSON'S FINANCIAL ADVISOR

     Patterson retained Merrill Lynch to act as its financial advisor in
connection with the merger. On February 4, 2001, Merrill Lynch rendered its oral
opinion to the Patterson board of directors, which was later confirmed in
writing, in the Merrill Lynch fairness opinion letter dated February 4, 2001,
that, as of that date and based upon and subject to the factors and assumptions
described in the Merrill Lynch fairness opinion letter, the exchange ratio was
fair from a financial point of view to Patterson.

     THE FULL TEXT OF THE MERRILL LYNCH FAIRNESS OPINION, WHICH SETS FORTH THE
ASSUMPTIONS MADE, MATTERS CONSIDERED, AND QUALIFICATIONS AND LIMITATIONS ON THE
REVIEW UNDERTAKEN BY MERRILL LYNCH, IS ATTACHED AS ANNEX C TO THIS JOINT PROXY
STATEMENT/PROSPECTUS AND IS INCORPORATED IN THIS DOCUMENT BY REFERENCE. THE
SUMMARY OF THE MERRILL LYNCH FAIRNESS OPINION SET FORTH IN THIS JOINT PROXY
STATEMENT/PROSPECTUS IS QUALIFIED IN ITS ENTIRETY BY REFERENCE TO THE FULL TEXT
OF THE OPINION. STOCKHOLDERS OF PATTERSON ARE URGED TO READ THE OPINION IN ITS
ENTIRETY. THE MERRILL LYNCH FAIRNESS OPINION WAS PROVIDED TO THE PATTERSON BOARD
FOR ITS INFORMATION AND IS DIRECTED ONLY TO THE FAIRNESS FROM A FINANCIAL POINT
OF VIEW OF THE EXCHANGE RATIO TO PATTERSON AND DOES NOT ADDRESS THE MERITS OF
THE UNDERLYING DECISION BY PATTERSON TO ENGAGE IN THE MERGER AND DOES NOT
CONSTITUTE A RECOMMENDATION TO PATTERSON'S STOCKHOLDERS AS TO HOW THE
STOCKHOLDERS SHOULD VOTE ON THE MERGER OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED BY THE
MERGER AGREEMENT. MERRILL LYNCH HAS NOT EXPRESSED ANY OPINION AS TO THE PRICES
AT WHICH PATTERSON COMMON STOCK WILL TRADE FOLLOWING THE ANNOUNCEMENT OR
CONSUMMATION OF THE MERGER.

     The summary set forth below does not purport to be a complete description
of the analyses underlying the Merrill Lynch fairness opinion or the
presentation made by Merrill Lynch to the Patterson board. The preparation of a
fairness opinion is a complex and analytical process involving various
determinations as to the most appropriate and relevant methods of financial
analysis and the application of those methods to the particular circumstances
and, therefore, the opinion is not readily susceptible to partial analysis or
summary description. In arriving at its opinion, Merrill Lynch did not attribute
any particular weight to any analysis or factor considered by it, but rather
made qualitative judgments as to the significance and relevance of each analysis
and factor. Accordingly, Merrill Lynch believes that its analyses must be
considered as a whole and that selecting portions of its analyses, without
considering all of its analyses, would create an incomplete view of the process
underlying the Merrill Lynch fairness opinion.

     In performing its analyses, numerous assumptions were made with respect to
industry performance, general business, economic, market and financial
conditions and other matters, many of which are beyond the control of Merrill
Lynch, UTI or Patterson. Any estimates contained in the analyses performed by
Merrill Lynch are not necessarily indicative of actual values or future results,
which may be significantly more or less favorable than suggested by the
analyses. Additionally, estimates of the value of businesses or securities do
not purport to be appraisals or to reflect the prices at which the businesses or
securities might actually be sold. Accordingly, the analyses and estimates are
inherently subject to substantial uncertainty. In addition, the requirement for
the delivery of the Merrill Lynch fairness opinion was among several factors
taken into consideration by the Patterson board in making its determination to
approve the merger agreement and the merger and in reaching its determination to
recommend approval of the merger agreement and the transactions contemplated by
the merger agreement, including the merger, the respective proposed amendments
to Patterson's restated certificate of incorporation authorizing additional
Patterson common shares and the change in Patterson's name. Consequently, the
Merrill Lynch analyses described below should not be viewed as determinative of
the decision of the Patterson board or Patterson's management with respect to
the fairness of the exchange ratio.

     In arriving at its opinion, Merrill Lynch, among other things:

     - Reviewed certain publicly available business and financial information
       relating to UTI and Patterson that Merrill Lynch deemed to be relevant
       including (a) Annual Reports on Form 10-K and related audited financial
       statements for the three years ended December 31, 1999 and (b) Quarterly
       Reports on Form 10-Q and related unaudited financial statements for the
       quarterly periods ending March 31, 2000, June 30, 2000 and September 30,
       2000;

     - Reviewed certain information, including financial forecasts, relating to
       the business, earnings, cash flow, assets, liabilities and prospects of
       UTI, as well as the amount of the cost savings and related expenses and
       synergies expected to result from the merger (the "Expected Synergies")
       furnished to Merrill Lynch by Patterson;

     - Conducted discussions with members of senior management of UTI and
       Patterson concerning the matters described in the two preceding
       paragraphs above, as well as their respective businesses and prospects
       before and after giving effect to the merger;

     - Reviewed the market prices and valuation multiples for UTI shares and
       Patterson shares and compared them with those of certain publicly traded
       companies that Merrill Lynch deemed to be relevant;

     - Reviewed the results of operations of UTI and Patterson and compared them
       with those of certain publicly traded companies that Merrill Lynch deemed
       to be relevant;

     - Compared the proposed financial terms of the merger with the financial
       terms of certain other transactions which Merrill Lynch deemed to be
       relevant;

     - Reviewed the potential pro forma impact of the merger on Patterson;

     - Reviewed a draft dated February 4, 2001 of the merger agreement; and

     - Reviewed such other financial studies and analyses and took into account
       such other matters as Merrill Lynch deemed necessary, including Merrill
       Lynch's assessment of general economic, market and monetary conditions.

     In preparing its opinion, Merrill Lynch assumed and relied on the accuracy
and completeness of all information supplied or otherwise made available to
Merrill Lynch, discussed with or reviewed by or for Merrill Lynch, or publicly
available, and Merrill Lynch did not assume any responsibility for independently
verifying such information or undertake an independent evaluation or appraisal
of any of the assets or liabilities of UTI or receive any such evaluation or
appraisal. In addition, Merrill Lynch did not assume any obligation to conduct
any physical inspection of the properties or facilities of UTI. With respect to
the financial forecast information and the Expected Synergies furnished to or
discussed with Merrill Lynch by

UTI or Patterson, Merrill Lynch assumed that they were reasonably prepared and
reflected the best currently available estimates and judgment of UTI's or
Patterson's managements as to the expected future financial performance of UTI
or Patterson, as the case may be, and the Expected Synergies. Merrill Lynch made
no independent investigation of any legal matters and accounting advice given to
such parties and their respective boards of directors, including, without
limitation, advice as to the accounting and tax consequences of the merger.
Merrill Lynch also assumed that the signed merger agreement would be
substantially similar to the February 4, 2001 draft reviewed by Merrill Lynch.

     Merrill Lynch's opinion is necessarily based upon market, economic and
other conditions as they exist and can be evaluated on, and on the information
made available to Merrill Lynch as of the date of the opinion. Merrill Lynch
assumed that in the course of obtaining the necessary regulatory or other
consents or approvals (contractual or otherwise) for the merger, no
restrictions, including any divestiture requirements or amendments or
modifications, will be imposed that will have a material adverse effect on the
contemplated benefits of the merger.

     The exchange ratio was determined through analyses of current and projected
financial data of both Patterson and UTI and through negotiations between the
chairmen of both Patterson and UTI. After substantial analysis and
consideration, the merger was authorized by the Patterson board.

     The following is a brief summary of the material analyses performed by
Merrill Lynch in connection with its preparation of the Merrill Lynch fairness
opinion. Some of these summaries of financial analyses include information
presented in tabular format. In order to understand fully the financial analyses
used by Merrill Lynch, the tables must be read together with the text of each
summary. The tables alone do not constitute a complete description of the
financial analyses. Considering the data set forth in the tables without
considering the full narrative description of the financial analyses, including
the methodologies and assumptions underlying the analyses, could create a
misleading or incomplete view of the financial analyses performed by Merrill
Lynch.

     Financial Forecasts.  UTI and Patterson provided Merrill Lynch with their
respective forecasted financial performance. Merrill Lynch used such forecasted
financial information in conducting its analyses.

     Contribution Analysis.  Using the forecasts described above for both UTI
and Patterson for the years 2000 and 2001, Merrill Lynch compared the relative
projected levels of earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and
amortization ("EBITDA"), net income after income taxes ("Net Income") and
after-tax cash flow ("Cash Flow") for each company during this period. Merrill
Lynch compared the relative levels of each of these financial measures both with
and without incorporating the impact of the Expected Synergies in UTI's
financial measures.

     Relative levels of EBITDA, Net Income and Cash Flow were used to develop
implied equity value contributions. The results of these analyses are set forth
below.

                                                                PATTERSON'S IMPLIED
                                                         EQUITY MARKET VALUE CONTRIBUTION
                                                      ---------------------------------------
                                                           WITHOUT                WITH
VALUATION BASIS                                       EXPECTED SYNERGIES   EXPECTED SYNERGIES
- ---------------                                       ------------------   ------------------

2000E EBITDA........................................         57.6%                47.6%
2001E EBITDA........................................         51.3                 46.8
2000E Net Income....................................         64.8                 44.8
2001E Net Income....................................         51.1                 45.3
2000E Cash Flow.....................................         57.8                 49.3
2001E Cash Flow.....................................         53.1                 49.1

     The contribution analysis implied an exchange ratio of 0.883-0.956 or a
Patterson implied equity value contribution of 51.0%-53.0% without incorporating
the impact of the Expected Synergies in UTI's financial measures and an exchange
ratio of 1.036-1.216 or a Patterson implied equity value contribution of 45.0%-
49.0% after incorporating the impact of the Expected Synergies in UTI's
financial measures.

     Comparable Company Acquisition Analysis.  Merrill Lynch also reviewed
publicly available information relating to comparable merger and acquisition
transactions in respect of companies with primarily contract drilling
operations. Because the reasons for, and circumstances surrounding, each of the
comparable transactions analyzed were so diverse and due to the dramatic
disparity in implied transaction multiples for the comparable transactions
analyzed, Merrill Lynch believes that a purely quantitative comparable company
acquisition analysis would not be dispositive in the context of the merger.
Merrill Lynch, therefore, deemed a comparable company acquisition analysis not
to be relevant in this situation.

     Comparable Company Trading Analysis.  Merrill Lynch reviewed and compared
certain financial information, ratios and public market multiples derived from
the Patterson and UTI projections to corresponding financial information, ratios
and public market multiples for four other publicly traded corporations in the
land drilling industry:

     - Grey Wolf, Inc.

     - Nabors Industries, Inc.

     - Precision Drilling Corporation

     - Pride International, Inc.

     The selected companies were chosen because they are publicly traded
companies with financial and operating characteristics which Merrill Lynch
deemed to be similar to those of Patterson and UTI, including, among other
things, equity market capitalization and land drilling focus. Merrill Lynch
calculated various financial ratios for the selected companies and compared them
to those calculated for Patterson and UTI. The ratios for the selected companies
were based on publicly available information, including estimates provided by
Merrill Lynch research. Merrill Lynch calculated the following financial ratios:

     - Enterprise value (defined as market value of common equity plus book
       value of debt less cash) multiples of 2001E EBITDA; and

     - Equity value multiples of 2001E Net Income and 2001E Cash Flow.

     The following table shows the relevant ranges determined by Merrill Lynch
for the selected companies.

FINANCIAL MEASURE                                        RELEVANT RANGE
- -----------------                                        --------------

2001E EBITDA..........................................   10.0x-12.0x
2001E Net Income......................................    20.0-30.0
2001E Cash Flow.......................................    15.0-18.0

     From the enterprise value ranges implied by these multiple ranges, Merrill
Lynch determined a relevant enterprise value range for Patterson under this
method of $1,450 million to $1,850 million, or an equity value range per diluted
share of $38.13 to $48.40.

     From the enterprise value ranges implied by these multiple ranges, and
without incorporating the Expected Synergies in UTI's financial measures,
Merrill Lynch determined a relevant enterprise value range for UTI under this
method of $1,400 million to $1,800 million or an equity value range per diluted
share of $34.58 to $44.81. From the enterprise value ranges implied by these
multiple ranges, and after incorporating the Expected Synergies in UTI's
financial measures, Merrill Lynch determined a relevant enterprise value range
for UTI under this method of $1,700 million to $2,100 million or an equity value
range per diluted share of $42.25 to $52.48.

     None of the selected companies are identical to Patterson or UTI.
Accordingly, an analysis of the results of the foregoing is not purely
mathematical. Rather, it involves complex considerations and judgments
concerning differences in financial and operating characteristics of the
selected companies and

other factors that could affect the public trading value of the comparable
companies or company to which they are being compared.

     The comparable company trading analysis implied an exchange ratio of
0.907-0.926 or a Patterson implied equity value contribution of 51.8%-52.3%
without incorporating the impact of the Expected Synergies in UTI's financial
measures and an exchange ratio of 1.084-1.108 or a Patterson implied equity
value contribution of 47.3%-47.9% after incorporating the impact of the Expected
Synergies in UTI's financial measures.

     Merger Premium Analysis.  In order to determine an implied exchange ratio
range based upon a merger premium analysis, Merrill Lynch examined premiums paid
for the target's equity value per share over pre-announcement stock prices one
day prior to announcement, one week prior to announcement and four weeks prior
to announcement in corporate merger transactions with a transaction value in the
range of $1.0 billion to $2.0 billion for the periods of 1990 to present.

     The following table shows the relevant ranges selected by Merrill Lynch for
the acquisition premiums paid over the target's stock price for one day, one
week and four weeks prior to the announcement.

  ONE DAY      ONE WEEK     FOUR WEEKS
- -----------   -----------   -----------
LOW    HIGH   LOW    HIGH   LOW    HIGH
- ----   ----   ----   ----   ----   ----

28.0%  30.0%  30.0%  33.0%  33.0%  36.0%

     The merger premium analysis implied an exchange ratio of 1.195-1.241 or a
Patterson implied equity value contribution of 44.5%-45.4%.

     Because the reasons for, and circumstances surrounding, each of the
transactions analyzed were different, Merrill Lynch believes that a purely
quantitative merger premium analysis would not be dispositive in the context of
the merger. Merrill Lynch further believes that an appropriate use of a merger
premium analysis in this instance involves quantitative judgments concerning the
differences between the characteristics of these transactions and the merger
that would affect the value of UTI and Patterson, which judgments are reflected
in Merrill Lynch's opinion.

     Relative Stock Price Analysis.  Using closing stock prices for Patterson
and UTI at February 2, 2001, as well as average closing stock prices for both
companies for the periods 30 days, 60 days, 90 days, 180 days and one year prior
to February 2, 2001, Merrill Lynch derived implied exchange ratios for Patterson
and UTI based on each of these average stock prices.

     The relative stock price analysis implied an exchange ratio of 0.750-0.900
or a Patterson implied equity value contribution of 52.5%-57.0%.

     Merger Consequences.  For both Patterson's projections and UTI's
projections, Merrill Lynch analyzed the respective contributions of each of
Patterson and UTI to the estimated Net Income of the combined company giving
effect to the merger on a pro forma basis for the year 2001 and analyzed the
increase in Net Income per current Patterson share resulting from the merger.
The foregoing analysis indicated that the merger would result in approximately
8.9% accretion to forecasted 2001 Net Income per current Patterson share,
assuming pooling-of-interests accounting treatment, before one-time merger
related costs and expenses and including the Expected Synergies.

     Merrill Lynch Financial Advisor Fee.  Pursuant to an engagement letter
dated February 2, 2001, Patterson retained Merrill Lynch to act as its financial
advisor in connection with the merger. Pursuant to the engagement letter,
Patterson agreed to pay Merrill Lynch a fee of $2,000,000, payable upon delivery
of the fairness opinion, for services rendered in connection with the merger.
Patterson has also agreed to reimburse Merrill Lynch for its reasonable
out-of-pocket expenses, including reasonable fees and disbursements of its legal
counsel. Additionally, Patterson has agreed to indemnify Merrill Lynch and its
affiliates and their respective officers, directors, employees, agents and
controlling persons against certain expenses, losses, claims, damages or
liabilities in connection with its services performed in connection with its
engagement.

     Patterson retained Merrill Lynch based upon Merrill Lynch's experience and
expertise. Merrill Lynch is an internationally recognized investment banking and
advisory firm. Merrill Lynch, as part of its investment banking business, is
continuously engaged in the valuation of businesses and securities in connection
with mergers and acquisitions, negotiated underwritings, competitive biddings,
secondary distributions of listed and unlisted securities, private placements
and valuations for corporate and other purposes. In the ordinary course of its
business, Merrill Lynch and its affiliates may actively trade the equity
securities of Patterson and UTI (and anticipate trading after the merger in the
securities of Patterson-UTI) for their own accounts and for the accounts of
customers and, accordingly, may at any time hold a long or short position in
these securities.

INTERESTS OF CERTAIN PERSONS IN THE MERGER

     UTI Directors and Executive Officers.  In considering the recommendation of
the UTI board of directors with respect to the merger, UTI stockholders should
be aware that some directors and executive officers have interests in the merger
that are different from UTI stockholders generally. The UTI board was aware of
these interests and took them into account in approving the merger.

     - Pursuant to the terms of the merger agreement, five of the seven members
       of the UTI board will be appointed directors of Patterson-UTI:

     - Under the merger agreement, Patterson has agreed to indemnify and hold
       harmless all past and present officers and directors of UTI to the
       fullest extent such persons may be indemnified pursuant to UTI's restated
       certificate of incorporation and bylaws for acts or omissions occurring
       at and prior to the effective time of the merger and to promptly advance
       reasonable litigation expenses incurred by such officers and directors in
       connection with investigating, preparing and defending any action arising
       out of such acts or omissions.

     - For a period of six years after the effective time of the merger,
       Patterson has agreed that it will provide UTI's current officers and
       directors with an insurance and indemnification policy that provides for
       coverage of events occurring prior to the effective time that is no less
       favorable than the existing policy or, if substantially equivalent
       insurance coverage is unavailable, the best available coverage; provided
       however, that Patterson shall not be required to pay an annual premium
       for such insurance in excess of $300,000 (two times the last annual
       premium paid by UTI preceding the date of the merger agreement).

     All outstanding stock options held by Mark S. Siegel, Vaughn E. Drum, John
E. Vollmer III and Bruce Sauers, executive officers of UTI, and one of its
directors, Kenneth N. Berns, will vest at closing of the merger due to change of
control provisions in their respective option agreements. In addition, four
other UTI employees hold stock options to purchase an aggregate of less than
65,000 shares of UTI common stock that will vest at closing of the merger. Three
of UTI's directors and officers, Messrs. Siegel, Berns and Vollmer, have
employment arrangements with UTI that also will entitle them to receive a
payment equal to one year's salary upon a change of control in UTI and the
cessation of their employment. UTI's President and Chief Executive Officer,
Vaughn E. Drum, has an employment agreement with UTI that provides that if his
employment is terminated without cause (as that term is defined in his
employment agreement), or, if he voluntarily terminates his employment within
one year of an adverse change (a significant reduction of his authority, duties
or responsibilities, his removal from office, a reduction in his salary or
material reduction in benefits, or a transfer without his consent to a location
greater than 40 miles from his previous work location), he would receive
compensation comprising one year's salary, up to one-half of one year's salary
as separation pay, vacation pay, any bonus, full vesting of all of his interests
under benefit plans and continuation of his benefits.

     UTI directors and executive officers beneficially owned, as of the record
date, approximately   % of the outstanding UTI common stock, including those
shares of UTI common stock underlying outstanding stock options and warrants.

     Patterson Directors and Executive Officers.  All outstanding unvested stock
options that Patterson has granted to its employees and those of its
subsidiaries under its 1993 stock incentive plan, including those stock options
granted to the three management members of Patterson's board of directors and
one other executive officer of Patterson, vest upon a change of control. The
merger will constitute a change of control under the plan. A total of not more
than 1,674,140 unvested stock options under the plan will become vested and
therefore exercisable as a result of the merger. Information follows concerning
those stock options held by the three management board members and one other
executive officer that will vest as a result of the merger.

                                                                           TOTAL OPTIONS
                                                                            VESTED UPON

                                       Financial Officer

     The Patterson board of directors was aware of these interests and took them
into account in approving the merger.

     The Patterson directors and executive officers beneficially owned, as of
the record date, approximately   % of the outstanding shares of Patterson common
stock, including those shares of Patterson common stock underlying outstanding
stock options.

ACCOUNTING TREATMENT

     We intend to account for the merger as a pooling-of-interests for financial
reporting purposes. Under this method of accounting, the recorded assets and
liabilities of Patterson and UTI will be carried forward to Patterson-UTI, at
their historical amounts, and income of Patterson-UTI will include income for
the entire fiscal year in which the merger occurs, as well as for prior periods.

     The unaudited combined pro forma data for the merger included in this joint
proxy statement/ prospectus has been prepared using the pooling-of-interests
method of accounting. See "Unaudited Pro Forma Combined Financial Statements."

     The merger agreement provides that it is a condition to the obligations of
Patterson and UTI that certain affiliates of Patterson and UTI execute a written
agreement at the effective time of the merger to the effect that they have not
transferred shares of Patterson common stock or shares of UTI common stock
within the preceding 30 days and will not transfer any shares of Patterson
common stock or shares of UTI common stock prior to the date that Patterson-UTI
publishes financial statements that reflect 30 days of operations of
Patterson-UTI (which written agreements relate to the ability of Patterson-UTI
to account for the merger as a pooling-of-interests).

REGULATORY APPROVALS

     Under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act, the merger may not be completed unless
Patterson, UTI and REMY Capital Partners III, L.P., a UTI stockholder, file
Notification and Report forms with the Federal Trade Commission and the
Antitrust Division of the U.S. Department of Justice and certain waiting periods
expire or are terminated. On February 22, 2001, Patterson, UTI and REMY Capital
submitted the regulatory filings to the Federal Trade Commission and the
Antitrust Division. The waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act will
expire on March 26, 2001, unless each party receives early termination of the
waiting period before that time. The waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino
Act may be extended

by receipt of a request for additional information or documentary material from
either the Antitrust Division or the Federal Trade Commission until the
expiration of 30 days after both Patterson and UTI are in substantial compliance
with that request (unless the extended waiting period is terminated early).

     Other than as we describe in this document, the merger does not require the
approval of any other U.S. federal or state or foreign agency.

MANAGEMENT OF PATTERSON-UTI FOLLOWING THE MERGER

     Immediately following the merger, Vincent A. Rossi, Jr. will resign as a
director of Patterson, and the Patterson-UTI board will, by resolution, increase
the Patterson-UTI board to 11 directors. The Patterson-UTI board will then elect
Mark S. Siegel, Vaughn E. Drum, Kenneth N. Berns, Curtis W. Huff and Nadine C.
Smith, all of whom are existing UTI directors, to fill the newly created
vacancies. The 11 board members will serve until the Patterson-UTI 2002 annual
meeting of stockholders or until their successors are elected and qualified.

     The merger agreement does not specify who will be the Chairman of the Board
and the executive officers of Patterson-UTI following the merger. Formal action
with respect to these positions will be taken by the new Patterson-UTI board of
directors promptly following closing of the merger. At the time that our boards
of directors approved the merger agreement, they anticipated that Mark S.
Siegel, Chairman of the Board of UTI, would become Chairman of the Board of
Patterson-UTI, and that Cloyce A. Talbott, Chairman of the Board and Chief
Executive Officer of Patterson, would be the Chief Executive Officer of
Patterson-UTI.

RIGHTS OF DISSENTING STOCKHOLDERS

     Neither the Patterson stockholders nor the UTI stockholders will be
entitled to dissenters' rights under the Delaware General Corporation Law or any
other law in connection with the merger.

DELISTING AND DEREGISTRATION OF UTI COMMON STOCK

     If the merger is completed, the shares of UTI common stock will be delisted
from the American Stock Exchange and will be deregistered under the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934. The stockholders of UTI will become stockholders of
Patterson and their rights as stockholders will be governed by Patterson's
restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws and by the laws of the State of
Delaware. See "Comparison of Stockholders' Rights."

RESALE OF SHARES OF PATTERSON COMMON STOCK ISSUED IN THE MERGER

     The shares of Patterson common stock issued to UTI stockholders in the
merger will be freely transferable under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended,
except for shares issued to holders of UTI common stock who are considered to be
"affiliates" of UTI under Rule 145 of the Securities Act, or of Patterson under
Rule 144 of the Securities Act. The definition of "affiliate" is complex and
depends on the specific facts, but generally includes directors, executive
officers, 10% stockholders and other persons with the power to direct the
management and policies of the company in question.

     Under applicable securities regulations, affiliates of UTI may not sell the
shares of Patterson common stock received in the merger except:

     - pursuant to an effective registration statement under the Securities Act,

     - in compliance with an exemption from the registration requirements of the
       Securities Act, or

     - in compliance with Rule 145 under the Securities Act.

Generally, those rules permit resales of shares received by UTI affiliates
during the year following the completion of the merger, so long as Patterson has
complied with certain reporting requirements and the selling stockholder
complies with certain volume and manner of sale restrictions, and freely
thereafter.

     Sales or transfers of shares of Patterson common stock by such UTI
affiliates, or by affiliates of Patterson, during the 30 days prior to the
merger and until Patterson-UTI announces or files a report with the SEC that
sets forth the combined financial results of Patterson-UTI for a period of at
least 30 days of combined operations following the date on which the merger is
completed may also adversely affect qualification of the merger as a
pooling-of-interests for accounting purposes.

     Patterson and UTI have agreed to deliver to each other at least 30 days
prior to the special meetings a signed agreement by each person that may be
deemed to be an affiliate of Patterson or UTI to the effect that the person will
not sell, transfer or otherwise dispose of his shares of UTI or Patterson common
stock, or options to purchase such shares, during the 30 days prior to
completion of the merger. Each person will also agree in that signed agreement
that, following the merger, the person will not sell, transfer or otherwise
dispose of the shares of Patterson common stock received by the person in the
merger except in compliance with the applicable provisions of the Securities Act
and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder and only after Patterson
announces or files a report with the SEC that sets forth the combined financial
results of Patterson and UTI for a period of at least 30 days of combined
operations following the date on which the merger was completed.

     This joint proxy statement/prospectus does not cover any resales of shares
of Patterson common stock received by affiliates of UTI.

CERTAIN UNITED STATES FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSEQUENCES

     In General.  The following discussion summarizes certain U.S. federal
income tax consequences of the merger. Tax consequences which are different from
or in addition to those described herein may apply to UTI stockholders who are
subject to special treatment under the U.S. federal income tax laws, such as
non-U.S. persons, tax exempt organizations, financial institutions, insurance
companies, broker-dealers, UTI stockholders who hold their UTI common stock as
part of a hedge, straddle, wash sale, synthetic security, conversion
transaction, or other integrated investment comprised of UTI common stock and
one or more other investments, persons with a "functional currency" (as defined
in the Internal Revenue Code) other than the U.S. dollar, and persons who
acquired their shares of UTI common stock in compensatory transactions. The
discussion does not address non-U.S. or state or local tax considerations.
Moreover, the tax consequences to holders of UTI stock options and UTI warrants
are not discussed.

     THIS SUMMARY IS NOT A SUBSTITUTE FOR AN INDIVIDUAL ANALYSIS OF THE TAX
CONSEQUENCES OF THE MERGER TO YOU. YOU SHOULD CONSULT A TAX ADVISOR REGARDING
THE PARTICULAR FEDERAL, STATE, LOCAL AND NON-U.S. TAX CONSEQUENCES OF THE MERGER
IN LIGHT OF YOUR OWN SITUATION.

     It is a condition precedent to the closing of the merger that opinions of
Baker & Hostetler LLP and Fulbright & Jaworski L.L.P. be delivered to Patterson
and UTI, respectively, to the effect that the merger qualifies as a
reorganization under Section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code. The opinions
will be subject to certain qualifications and assumptions as noted therein. In
addition, the opinions will be based in part upon representations of Patterson
and UTI provided to counsel, which counsel will assume to be true, correct and
complete. If the representations are inaccurate, the opinions could be adversely
affected. The opinions will also be based upon counsel's interpretation of the
Internal Revenue Code, applicable Treasury regulations, judicial authority and
administrative rulings and practice, all as of the date of the opinions. There
can be no assurance that future legislative, judicial or administrative changes
or interpretations will not adversely affect the accuracy of the conclusions set
forth herein. No ruling has been requested or received from the Internal Revenue
Service. The opinions will not be binding upon the Internal Revenue Service or
any court, and neither the Internal Revenue Service nor any court will be
precluded from adopting a contrary position.

     Assuming the merger qualifies as a reorganization under Section 368(a) of
the Internal Revenue Code, the U.S. federal income tax consequences will include
the following:

     - Patterson and UTI will each be a party to such reorganization within the
       meaning of Section 368(b) of the Internal Revenue Code;

     - No gain or loss will be recognized by Patterson, UTI or holders of shares
       of Patterson common stock as a result of the merger;

     - No gain or loss will be recognized by holders of UTI common stock solely
       upon their receipt in the merger of Patterson common stock in exchange
       therefor;

     - The aggregate tax basis of the shares of Patterson common stock received
       by a UTI stockholder in the merger will be the same as the aggregate tax
       basis of the shares of UTI common stock surrendered in exchange therefor;
       and

     - The holding period of the shares of Patterson common stock received by a
       UTI stockholder in the merger will include the holding period of the
       shares of UTI common stock surrendered in exchange therefor, provided
       that such shares of UTI common stock are held as capital assets at the
       effective time of the merger.

     In the event that the merger were held not to qualify as a reorganization
under Section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code, UTI would recognize gain or
loss on the transfer of its assets to Patterson and each UTI stockholder would
recognize gain or loss in an amount equal to the difference between the tax
basis in such UTI stockholder's shares of UTI common stock and the fair market
value, as of the effective date of the merger, of the shares of Patterson common
stock received in exchange therefor. In such event, such UTI stockholder's tax
basis in the shares of Patterson common stock so received would be equal to
their fair market value as of the effective date of the merger, and the holding
period for such shares of Patterson common stock would begin on the day after
the effective date of the merger.

     Information Reporting; Records.  Each UTI stockholder will be required to
retain records and file with such UTI stockholder's United States federal income
tax return a statement setting forth certain facts relating to the merger.

     THE UNITED STATES FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSEQUENCES SUMMARIZED ABOVE ARE FOR
GENERAL INFORMATION ONLY. YOU SHOULD CONSULT A TAX ADVISOR AS TO THE PARTICULAR
CONSEQUENCES OF THE MERGER THAT MAY APPLY TO YOU, INCLUDING THE APPLICATION OF
STATE, LOCAL, NON-U.S. AND OTHER FEDERAL TAX LAWS.

                              THE MERGER AGREEMENT

     The following is a summary of the material provisions of the merger
agreement, a copy of which is attached as Annex A to this document and is
incorporated in this document by reference. This summary is qualified in its
entirety by reference to the full text of the merger agreement. You should read
the merger agreement because it, and not this document, is the legal document
that governs the merger.

THE MERGER

     Upon the terms and conditions of the merger agreement, and in accordance
with the Delaware General Corporation Law, at the effective time, UTI will merge
with and into Patterson. Patterson will continue as the surviving corporation
under the name Patterson-UTI Energy, Inc., if the proposed amendment to its
restated certificate of incorporation is approved by stockholders at the
Patterson special meeting or, if not approved, under its existing name.

     The closing date of the merger will occur no later than the second business
day following the date on which all conditions to the merger, other than those
conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the closing, have been
satisfied or waived, unless the parties agree on another time. Contemporaneously
with the closing, Patterson and UTI will file a certificate of merger with the
Secretary of State of the State of Delaware. The effective time of the merger
will be the time Patterson and UTI file the certificate of merger with the
Secretary of State of the State of Delaware or at a later time as we may agree,
but in no case later than 30 days following the date on which the certificate of
merger is filed.

     As a result of the merger, UTI will be merged with and into Patterson and
the separate corporate existence of UTI will cease.

MERGER CONSIDERATION

     Exchange Ratio.  Each outstanding share of common stock, stock option or
warrant for UTI common stock shall be exchanged as follows:

     - at the effective time of the merger, each outstanding whole share of UTI
       common stock (other than shares of UTI common stock held by UTI or any of
       its subsidiaries, which will be canceled and retired without the right to
       receive any consideration in exchange therefor) will be converted into
       the right to receive one share of Patterson common stock;

     - at the effective time of the merger, each outstanding warrant to purchase
       or acquire whole shares of UTI common stock will be converted into a
       warrant to purchase an equal number of shares of Patterson common stock
       at the same exercise price per share; and

     - each of the outstanding UTI stock options will be converted into a
       Patterson stock option as follows:

         - prior to the effective time of the merger, each stock option will be
           exercisable for that number of shares of UTI common stock covered by
           the UTI stock option at an exercise price per share equal to the
           exercise price of the UTI common stock; and

         - after the effective time of the merger, each converted stock option
           will be exercisable for that number of shares of Patterson common
           stock equal to the number of whole shares of UTI common stock covered
           by the UTI stock option. The converted options will be exercisable
           upon the same terms and conditions applied to the UTI stock options
           before the effective time of the merger, after giving effect to any
           existing provision in any UTI stock plan that provides for the
           automatic acceleration of vesting upon a change in control of UTI.

     Patterson has agreed to reserve for issuance the number of shares of
Patterson common stock that will become issuable upon the exercise of the UTI
stock options. Patterson has agreed to prepare and file a registration statement
and, if necessary, a "reoffer prospectus" with the Securities and Exchange
Commission with respect to the shares of Patterson common stock subject to the
converted options, and to

use its best efforts to keep the reoffer prospectus and its amendments effective
for so long as the converted options remain outstanding.

EXCHANGE PROCEDURES

     UTI Stockholders Should Not Send in Their UTI Stock Certificates Until They
Receive The Letter of Transmittal.  As soon as reasonably practicable after the
effective time of the merger, an exchange agent will mail a letter of
transmittal to each holder of record of UTI common stock certificates. This
letter of transmittal must be used in surrendering UTI stock certificates to the
exchange agent for cancellation. Upon surrender of a UTI stock certificate for
cancellation, together with a duly executed letter of transmittal and any other
documents that the exchange agent may reasonably require, the holder of the UTI
common stock certificate will be entitled to receive in exchange therefor (a) a
Patterson certificate representing the number of whole shares of Patterson
common stock that the holder has the right to receive, and (b) any unpaid
dividends and distributions, if any, that the holder has the right to receive
pursuant to the merger agreement, after giving effect to any required
withholding tax.

     After the effective time of the merger, each UTI common stock certificate,
until surrendered and exchanged, will represent only the right to receive a
certificate representing Patterson common stock and unpaid dividends and
distributions, if any. Holders of UTI stock certificates will not be entitled to
receive any dividends or other distributions with respect to Patterson common
stock declared or made by Patterson having a record date after the effective
time of the merger until the UTI common stock certificates are surrendered.
Subject to applicable law, following surrender of the UTI common stock
certificates, such dividends and distributions, if any, will be paid without
interest.

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES

     The merger agreement contains customary and substantially reciprocal
representations and warranties made by each party to the other. These
representations and warranties relate to, among other things:

     - corporate organization, qualification and good standing and ownership of
       subsidiaries;

     - material contracts;

     - government licenses and permits;

     - brokers; and

     - state takeover laws.

     The representations and warranties contained in the merger agreement will
not survive the merger, but they form the basis of certain conditions to our
obligations to complete the merger. Certain agreements in the merger agreement
will survive the effective time of the merger.

effect that the merger will constitute a Section 368(a) reorganization.

       the current directors and officers of UTI with an insurance and
       indemnification policy for a period of six years covering events
       occurring through the effective time at an annual cost not to exceed two
       times the annual cost of UTI's current coverage;

     - to provide officers and employees of UTI, who continue as Patterson
       employees, with employee benefits under plans and programs, which, in the
       aggregate, are no less favorable than those provided pursuant to
       Patterson's plans and programs in effect on the date of the merger
       agreement for the benefit of the officers and employees of Patterson;

     - to assume all UTI stock options outstanding under UTI's stock option

       outstanding under the UTI stock option plans in effect on the date of the
       merger agreement to be converted at the effective time into a stock

     Patterson and UTI have agreed that until the effective time of the merger,
they will, among other things:

       consistent with past practice; and

     - use commercially reasonable efforts to preserve intact their business
       organizations, retain the services of their officers and employees and
       maintain their relationships with its customers and suppliers.

     In addition, Patterson and UTI have agreed that, except as contemplated by
the merger agreement, as set forth in the disclosure schedules or with the

       subsidiaries;

     - issue, deliver, sell, pledge, dispose of or encumber any of its shares or
       other securities, subject to certain exceptions, or grant any rights,

       accordance with ordinary business operations;

     - amend its restated certificate of incorporation or amend in any material

     - change any material election relating to taxes, or settle or compromise
       any matter relating to a tax liability;

     - make any capital expenditures outside the ordinary course of business;

     - incur any debt or guarantee any indebtedness in excess of $4.0 million or
       issue, sell any debt securities, or make any loans, advances or capital
       contributions, with certain exceptions;

     - pay, discharge or satisfy any material claims, liabilities or

       collective bargaining agreement, change any material accounting principle
       used by it, or settle or compromise any litigation brought against it,
       except where amounts paid in settlement do not exceed $200,000, exclusive
       of insured amounts; or

     - authorize or enter into any agreement to do any of the foregoing.

NO SOLICITATION

     Each party has agreed that it will not, and will use its best efforts to
cause the officers, directors, employees, attorneys, financial advisors, agents
and other representatives and those of any of its subsidiaries to not:

     - directly or indirectly, solicit, initiate or knowingly encourage, or
       otherwise intentionally knowingly facilitate, any inquiries or the making
       of any proposal that constitutes a third party "acquisition proposal" of
       the type described below; or

     - directly or indirectly engage in any negotiations concerning, provide any
       confidential information or data to, or have any discussion with, a
       person or entity regarding a third party acquisition proposal of the type
       described below.

     However, each party is permitted to:

     - comply with Rule 14e-2 promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of
       1934 with regard to an acquisition proposal of the type described below;
       or

     - furnish information to, or enter into discussions or negotiations with,
       any person or entity in connection with an unsolicited, bona fide,
       written acquisition proposal of the type described below obtained before
       stockholder approval of the merger, or recommend the same to its
       stockholders, if, and only to the extent that:

         - the party's board of directors, after consultation with legal
           counsel, determines in good faith that such action is required for
           the board of directors to comply with its fiduciary duties to its
           stockholders as imposed by the Delaware General Corporation Law; and

         - before furnishing information, the party's board of directors
           receives an executed confidentiality agreement. The terms of the
           confidentiality agreement must be no less favorable to the other
           party and no less restrictive on the person requesting the
           information than the confidentiality agreement executed by the
           parties to the merger agreement; and

         - before entering into discussions or negotiations with or recommending
           the acquisition proposal, the party's board of directors determine in
           good faith and after consultation with its financial advisor that, in
           light of the information furnished to it relating to such acquisition
           proposal, the acquisition proposal contemplated is reasonably likely
           to be consummated (taking into account all legal, financial and
           regulatory aspects of the proposal) and, if consummated, would result
           in a transaction more favorable to that party's stockholders from a
           financial point of view than the transaction contemplated by the
           merger agreement.

     Each party agrees to promptly notify the other upon receipt of any
inquiries, proposals or offers related to or constituting an acquisition
proposal and will thereafter keep the other informed of its status and terms.
The notice will include the name of the person making, and the material terms
of, the inquiry, proposal or offer.

     As used herein, "acquisition proposal" means any proposal or offer with
respect to a merger, reorganization, share exchange, consolidation or similar
transaction involving, or any purchase of all or a substantial portion of the
assets or any equity securities of a party to the merger agreement or any of its
subsidiaries, other than the proposed merger described herein.

ACCOUNTING AND TAX MATTERS

     Patterson and UTI agree that, unless otherwise agreed in writing, neither
shall knowingly take or fail to take any action which would jeopardize:

     - the ability to treat the merger as a pooling-of-interests for accounting
       purposes; or

     - the qualification of the merger as a reorganization within the meaning of
       Section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986.

ACCESS AND INFORMATION

     Both Patterson and UTI have agreed to allow one another reasonable access
to make such inspections as they may reasonably require, subject to certain
limitations.

STOCK LISTING

                             INFORMATION ABOUT UTI

BUSINESS

     UTI is a leading provider of onshore contract drilling services to
companies that explore for and produce oil and natural gas. UTI's drilling rigs
operate in the oil and natural gas producing basins of the states of Texas, New
Mexico, Oklahoma and Louisiana and in the provinces of Alberta, British Columbia
and Saskatchewan, Canada. As of February 9, 2001, UTI had a drilling fleet of
150 land drilling rigs, of which 111 were "active rigs," which are rigs that
were generating revenue. UTI also provides pressure pumping services in the
Appalachian basin.

     Beginning in 1995, UTI decided to expand its land drilling operations. To
effect this strategy, UTI disposed of its oilfield distribution business in
September 1995 and embarked on an acquisition program aimed at expanding UTI's
presence in the oil and natural gas producing regions in the United States.
Under this strategy, UTI has acquired 132 rigs since 1995. During this same time
period, UTI disposed of nine rigs primarily in the Appalachian Basin. UTI sold
five of the nine disposed rigs in 1999.

     Due to UTI's acquisitions of drilling rigs and favorable market conditions,
UTI has experienced a significant increase in revenues over the last few years.
In 2000, UTI had revenues from operations of $275,543,000, as compared to
$155,775,000 in 1999 and $186,157,000 in 1998.

     UTI's land drilling customers include major oil companies and various sized
independent producers. UTI follows a policy of keeping its drilling rigs
technologically competitive and well maintained and also continuously maintains
its pressure pumping equipment.

     UTI's rigs can drill to depths ranging from 8,000 to 30,000 feet. During
2000, UTI's average utilization rate was 62%, up from 43% for year 1999. In the
fourth quarter of 2000, UTI's average utilization rate was 70%.

     UTI had approximately 2,772 employees as of February 9, 2001, 2,633 of
which were field personnel and 139 of which served in selling and administrative
capacities. UTI's principal executive offices are located at 16800 Greenspoint
Park Drive, Suite 225N, Houston, Texas 77060, and its telephone number is (281)
873-4111. UTI's contract land drilling services are performed through regional
drilling units with regional drilling offices located in Midland, Tyler and
Victoria, Texas; Oklahoma City, Oklahoma; and Calgary, Alberta.

BOARD AND COMMITTEE MEETINGS

     The UTI board of directors has an executive committee, a compensation
committee and an audit committee. The UTI board of directors has not established
a nominating committee.

     The executive committee, which is composed of Messrs. Drum and Siegel, has
the authority to act for the UTI board in all matters permitted to be delegated
to it by law that arise between regular and special meetings of the UTI board.
The executive committee met informally on numerous occasions during the year
ended December 31, 2000.

     The UTI compensation committee, which is composed of Messrs. Hunt and
Spears, administers the employee stock option plan and similar plans of UTI and
determines the annual compensation to be paid to the executive officers of UTI.
The UTI compensation committee met one time during the fiscal year ended
December 31, 2000. The UTI compensation committee's report on executive
compensation for the fiscal year 2000 appears below.

     The UTI audit committee, is charged with recommending to the entire UTI
board the engagement and discharge of independent auditors of the financial
statements of UTI, reviewing the professional service provided by independent
auditors, reviewing the independence of independent auditors, reviewing with the
auditors the plan and results of the audit engagement, considering the range of
audit and non-audit fees, reviewing the adequacy of UTI's system of internal
accounting controls, reviewing the results of procedures for internal auditing
and consulting with the internal auditor of UTI with respect to all aspects of

fiscal year ended December 31, 2000. The UTI audit committee's report appears
below.

     The UTI board of directors met five times during the fiscal year ended
December 31, 2000. Each director attended, in person or by telephone, at least
75% of the meetings held by the UTI board of directors and by the committees on
which the director served.

AUDIT COMMITTEE REPORT

     The UTI audit committee has reviewed and discussed UTI's audited financial
statements for the year ended December 31, 2000 with management. The UTI audit
committee also discussed with Ernst & Young LLP, certified public accountants,
the independent auditors and accountants for UTI, the matters required to be
discussed by SAS 61 (Codification of Statements on Auditing Standards, AU
Section 380) with respect to those statements.

     The UTI audit committee has received the written disclosures and the letter
from Ernst & Young LLP required by Independence Standards Board Standard No. 1
(Independence Standards Board Standard No. 1, Independence Discussions with
Audit Committees) and have discussed with Ernst & Young LLP its independence in
connection with its audit of UTI's most recent financial statements. Based on
this review and these discussions, the UTI audit committee recommended to the
UTI board of directors that these audited financial statements be included in
UTI's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2000.

     Kenneth N. Berns, Robert B. Spears and Nadine C. Smith are the members of
the UTI audit committee. Mr. Spears and Ms. Smith are independent, as defined in
Section 121(B)(b)(ii) of the American Stock Exchange's listing standards. Mr.
Berns is not independent as defined in that rule because he is an employee of
and received compensation in excess of $60,000 from UTI. In addition, Mr. Berns
is an executive employee of and received compensation in excess of $60,000
during fiscal year 2000 from, REMY Investors & Consultants Incorporated, a
beneficial owner of greater than 10% of the outstanding shares of UTI common
stock. The UTI board of directors has, nonetheless, determined that Mr. Berns'
membership on the UTI audit committee is required by the best interests of UTI
and its stockholders. The UTI board determined that Mr. Berns' relationship with
this beneficial owner of UTI common stock does not in any way impair his
independence from UTI's management. To the contrary, Mr. Berns provides
substantial, direct stockholder representation on the UTI audit committee.

     The UTI board of directors has adopted a written charter for the UTI audit
committee, a copy of which is attached to this joint proxy statement/prospectus
as Annex F.

     The information in the foregoing four paragraphs shall not be deemed to be
soliciting material, or to be filed with the SEC or subject to Regulation 14A or
14C or to the liabilities of Section 18 of the Exchange Act, nor shall it be
deemed to be incorporated by reference into any filing under the Securities Act
or the Exchange Act, except to the extent that we specifically incorporate these
paragraphs by reference.

    options to purchase an aggregate of 1,486,750 shares granted to employees of
    UTI during 1998 and 1997. Pursuant to such action, Messrs. Drum, Siegel and
    Sauers had options to purchase 25,000, 770,000 and 2,500 shares of common
    stock, respectively, which were repriced and are included in this table as
    new grants during 1998 although new options were not actually granted as a
    result of such repricing.

(5) Mr. Vollmer became an officer of UTI in July 1998.

  Compensation Pursuant to Employee Benefit Plans

     UTI maintains several plans intended to provide incentives to its key
employees. These plans are described below:

     Incentive Compensation Plan.  UTI maintains an Incentive Compensation Plan
under which certain employees of UTI and its subsidiaries may be eligible to
receive a cash bonus following each calendar year based on a comparison of
financial performance against targets established for each plan year. In
addition, certain corporate office employees may receive annual bonuses on a
discretionary basis.

     Norton 1997 Stock Option Plan.  In July of 1999, UTI acquired Norton
Drilling Services, Inc. Norton Drilling Services, Inc. had a stock option plan
which UTI assumed. The options vest over three years. No further shares of
common stock are available for grant under the plan.

     1996 Employee Stock Option Plan.  In August 1996, UTI's stockholders
approved UTI's 1996 employee stock option plan. Under the this plan, UTI can
award options on up to 1,800,000 shares of common stock to certain employees of
UTI and its subsidiaries at a price equal to the fair market value of the stock
at the date the option is granted. In August of 1998 certain of the options were
repriced to the fair market value on the date of repricing. During 1999 and
2000, UTI awarded options to purchase 178,000 shares of common stock under the
1996 Plan. The 1996 employee stock option plan currently is administered by
UTI's compensation committee, and there are 12,600 shares of common stock
available for grant under the 1996 Plan.

     1997 Long-Term Incentive Plan.  In August 1997, UTI's stockholders approved
UTI's 1997 long-term incentive plan. Under this plan, UTI may grant stock
options, stock appreciation rights issued independent or in tandem with such
options, restricted stock awards and performance awards to certain employees of
UTI and its subsidiaries. In August of 1998, certain of the options were
repriced to the fair market value on the date of repricing. In June 1999, UTI's
stockholders increased the number of shares of common stock authorized for
issuance under the 1997 long-term incentive plan from 1,200,000 to 3,000,000. In
July 2000, UTI's stockholders increased the number of shares of common stock
authorized for issuance under the 1997 plan from 3,000,000 to 3,800,000. Options
are to be granted at a price not less than the fair market value of the common
stock on the date the option is granted. During 1999 and 2000, UTI awarded
options to purchase 1,563,000 shares of common stock. The options that have been
granted under the this plan vest over zero to five years. The 1997 long-term
incentive plan currently is administered by UTI's compensation committee, and
there are currently 1,214,800 shares of common stock available for grant.

DIRECTOR COMPENSATION

     Directors who are employees of UTI do not receive any additional
compensation for serving as a director or as a member of a committee of the UTI
board of directors. UTI's non-employee directors are each entitled to receive:

     - an annual retainer fee of $5,000;

     - $700 for each regular or special board of directors meeting attended; and

     - $500 for each committee meeting attended.

     All UTI directors have been and will be reimbursed for reasonable
out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection with attendance at board of
directors meetings and committee meetings.

     UTI maintains a non-employee director stock option plan. Under this
director plan:

     - options to purchase up to an aggregate of 600,000 shares of UTI common
       stock may be granted;

     - the purchase price per share shall be equal to the fair market value of
       UTI common stock as of the date of the grant;

     - a grant of an option to purchase 15,000 shares of UTI common stock is
       awarded to each non-employee director as of the date he or she is first
       elected;

     - automatic grants of an option to purchase 7,500 shares of UTI common
       stock occur on December 31 of each year to each non-employee director who
       has served for a period of at least one year;

     - options to purchase 30,000 shares of UTI common stock were awarded
       pursuant to this provision in 2000;

     - no options will be granted after December 18, 2005; and

     - all options issued expire five years from the date of grant.

     Messrs. Siegel, Berns and Drum each participate in UTI's 1996 Employee
Stock Option Plan and the 1997 Long-Term Incentive Plan and receive salaries in
their capacities as employees of UTI.

COMPENSATION COMMITTEE REPORT

     Annual Salaries and Other Cash Compensation.  In November 1997, the UTI
board of directors delegated to the UTI compensation committee the
responsibility to administer UTI's stock option plans and to determine
compensation levels for the executive officers. Prior to such time, the UTI
board of directors had administered UTI's stock option plans and had approved
compensation levels for the executive officers based upon recommendations of the
UTI compensation committee.

     In considering the amount and form of compensation to be provided for the
executive officers of UTI, the UTI compensation committee took into
consideration:

     - the size of UTI;

     - UTI's financial results and condition;

     - the nature of UTI's business;

     - business conditions in the oil and gas field services and supplies
       industries;

     - UTI's competitive position in the labor market for skilled executives;
       and

     - amounts paid by other firms to attract and retain executives of
       comparable competence and experience.

     UTI has sought to provide salaries that are competitive but not excessive
and to provide incentive compensation, in the form of performance related
bonuses under the UTI incentive compensation plan, to encourage executive
performance. The incentive compensation plan also is intended to diminish, for
successful employees, any potential competitive shortfall in their cash
compensation.

     The compensation of Mr. Drum, UTI's President and Chief Executive Officer,
was established to reflect the views of UTI's board and compensation committee
regarding his experience and performance, and the performance of UTI in light of
prevailing competitive conditions. The UTI compensation committee believes that
Mr. Drum is primarily responsible for the implementation of UTI board policies.
Mr. Drum has been effective in integrating acquisitions and positioning UTI to
take advantage of

improvements in demand and prices for UTI's services as they occur. Mr. Drum's
compensation is intended to reflect these views and to provide him incentives to
continue his successful leadership of UTI. In March 2000, Mr. Drum's annual
salary was increased to $225,000.

     Compensation Pursuant to Employee Benefit Plans.  It is the general policy
of UTI to review stock-based compensation on an annual basis. Awards of
stock-based compensation reflect the UTI board's and compensation committee's
desire to provide UTI employees who have substantial responsibility for UTI's
management and growth with additional incentives by increasing their proprietary
interest in the success of UTI. The decision whether to grant stock options to
any particular employee is based upon a variety of factors, including position,
performance, current share and stock option ownership and the need to insure the
continued employment of the employee with UTI. Grants of 501,000 stock options
were made to UTI's employees during 2000.

     Section 162(m) Deduction Limitation.  Section 162(m) of the Internal
Revenue Code imposes a limitation on deductions that can be taken by a publicly
held corporation for compensation paid to certain of its executive officers.
Under Section 162(m), a deduction is denied for compensation paid in a tax year
beginning on or after January 1, 1994, to the named executive officers to the
extent that such compensation exceeds $1 million per individual. Stock option
grants pursuant to UTI's employee benefit plans may be exempt from the deduction
limit if certain requirements are met. The UTI board of directors and the
compensation committee has considered the effect of Section 162(m) on UTI's
existing compensation program.

          The UTI Compensation Committee of the UTI Board of Directors

                               Mr. Terry H. Hunt
                              Mr. Robert B. Spears

EMPLOYMENT CONTRACTS AND CHANGE-IN-CONTROL ARRANGEMENTS

     UTI has an employment agreement with Mr. Drum. The annual salary currently
payable under such agreement is $225,000, which may be increased by UTI's board
of directors or the compensation committee. In addition, the agreement provides
that UTI's board of directors, in its discretion, may determine to pay Mr. Drum
additional compensation in the form of bonuses or incentive compensation. The
agreement has an initial term of five years continuing through December 2000,
and automatically extends for an additional year upon the completion of the
five-year term unless either party provides notice to the other of the intention
to terminate such contract 120 days prior to the termination date. In addition,
the employment agreement entitles Mr. Drum to receive four weeks paid vacation
per year and to participate fully in all employee plans and fringe benefit
programs established by UTI after the date of the contract in which other senior
executives of UTI are eligible to participate.

     In the event of a termination due to Mr. Drum's death or disability, his
estate is entitled to receive:

     - unused vacation pay;

     - a pro-rated portion of any bonus;

     - separation payment not more than 50% of his compensation in the most
       recent calendar year; and

     - vesting of all of his interests, under UTI stock option plans and any
       other employee plans of UTI.

     In the event Mr. Drum retires in accordance with UTI's retirement policies,
he is entitled to receive:

     - unused vacation pay;

     - a pro-rated portion of any bonus;

     - a separation payment; and

     - vesting of all of his interests in UTI's option or employee plans, but
       only to the extent provided in UTI's employee benefit plans for retiring
       employees.

     If Mr. Drum is terminated by UTI without cause, or if he terminates his
employment after an adverse change, he is entitled to receive:

     - termination pay of one year's salary;

     - unused vacation pay;

     - a separation payment;

     - the full amount of any bonus;

     - vesting of all of his interests in UTI's option or employee plans; and

     - continuation of all employee benefits, without any increase in cost to
       him, for a period of 18 months following termination.

     An adverse change is a significant reduction of his authority, duties or
responsibilities, his removal from office, a reduction in his salary or material
reduction in benefits, or a transfer without his consent to a location greater
than 40 miles from his previous work location. In connection with UTI's
relocation of its corporate headquarters from Wayne, Pennsylvania to Houston,
Texas, UTI agreed to provide relocation assistance if and when Mr. Drum's
employment with UTI is terminated.

     In 1997, the compensation committee approved employment arrangements with
Messrs. Siegel and Berns providing for annual salaries of $100,000 and $50,000
for a period of five years. Effective February 20, 2000, the annual salaries of
Messrs. Siegel and Berns increased to $125,000 and $90,000, respectively. UTI
also has an employment arrangement with Mr. Vollmer. In the event of a change in
control of UTI, UTI's obligation to pay such salaries would end and Messrs.
Siegel, Berns and Vollmer would each be entitled to payment of one year's salary
and Messrs. Siegel and Berns would be entitled to vesting of all options granted
in connection with such employment arrangements. Pursuant to the terms of Mr.
Vollmer's option agreements, the options vest on a change of control. Messrs.
Siegel and Berns are entitled to receive bonuses for extraordinary services
solely within the discretion of the board of directors and compensation
committee.

COMPENSATION COMMITTEE INTERLOCKS AND INSIDER PARTICIPATION

     Prior to November 1997, grants of stock options to UTI's executive officers
and Messrs. Siegel and Berns as well as salary levels of UTI's executive
officers were approved by the full UTI board of directors. In November 1997, the
UTI board of directors delegated these responsibilities to the UTI compensation
committee, which is comprised of Messrs. Hunt and Spears. Although the full UTI
board of directors authorized the repricing of options during 1998 (with Messrs.
Siegel, Drum and Berns abstaining), it is intended that the compensation
committee will determine compensation awarded to UTI's executive officers, as
well as Messrs. Siegel and Berns, in the future.

CERTAIN RELATIONSHIPS AND RELATED TRANSACTIONS

     In connection with REMY Capital Partners III, L.P.'s acquisition of its
ownership interest in UTI in March 1995, REMY Capital succeeded to a
registration rights agreement with UTI which provides REMY Capital with the
right to require UTI to use its best efforts to register shares held by REMY
Capital under the Securities Act. In the event that such rights are exercised in
connection with a primary offering proposed by UTI (or a secondary offering with
which UTI agrees to participate), REMY Capital would bear its pro rata share of
the costs of the offering, other than legal, accounting and printing costs which
UTI shall bear. In the event that REMY Capital elected to exercise such rights
otherwise than in

connection with an offering proposed by UTI, REMY Capital would bear all costs
of the offering. These rights continue so long as REMY capital continues to own
the common stock that it acquired.

     Mr. Siegel, Chairman of the Board of UTI, is President and sole stockholder
of REMY Investors, which is the general partner of REMY Capital. Mr. Berns, a
director and employee of UTI, is an employee of REMY Investors.

COMPLIANCE WITH SECTION 16(a) OF THE EXCHANGE ACT

     Section 16(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 requires UTI's
officers and directors and persons who beneficially own more than ten percent of
a registered class of UTI's equity securities to file reports of ownership and
changes in ownership with the SEC. Officers, directors and greater than ten
percent stockholders are required by the regulations promulgated under Section
16(a) to furnish UTI with copies of all Section 16(a) forms they file.

                          INFORMATION ABOUT PATTERSON

BUSINESS

     Patterson is one of the leading providers of domestic land drilling
services to major and independent oil and natural gas companies. Formed in 1978
and reincorporated in 1993 as a Delaware corporation, Patterson conducts
operations in Texas, New Mexico, Oklahoma, Louisiana, Mississippi and Utah.
Patterson has a drilling fleet of 152 rigs, 140 of which are currently
"marketable." Marketable rigs are rigs that are fully operable. Patterson
provides drilling and completion fluid services to other oil and natural gas
operators and also engages in the development, exploration, acquisition and
production of oil and natural gas.

     Patterson has established its reputation for reliable, high quality
drilling equipment and well-trained crews. Patterson continually seeks to modify
and upgrade its equipment to maximize the performance and capabilities of its
drilling rig fleet, which it believes provides it with a competitive advantage.
Additionally, Patterson has the in-house capability to design, manufacture,
repair, and modify its drilling rigs.

     Of Patterson's drilling rigs, 95 are capable of drilling to depths of
12,000 feet and greater, including 52 that are capable of drilling to 15,000
feet and greater. During 2000, Patterson drilled 1,485 wells for 224
non-affiliated customers maintaining an average utilization rate of 74%.

     Patterson's oil and natural gas activities are designed to complement its
land drilling operations and diversify its overall business strategy. These
activities are primarily focused in mature producing regions in the Permian
Basin and South Texas. Oil and natural gas operations comprised approximately 5%
of Patterson's consolidated operation revenues during 2000. At December 31,
2000, Patterson's proven developed reserves were approximately 1.8 million
barrels of oil equivalent, and it had a present value (discounted at 10% before
income taxes) of estimated future net revenues of approximately $22.8 million.

     Patterson's drilling and completion fluid services are provided to
operators of oil and gas wells located in its areas of operation, as well as in
the Gulf of Mexico. Operating revenues derived from these activities constituted
approximately 10% of Patterson's consolidated operating revenues for 2000.
Patterson believes that these services integrate well with its other core
operating activities. The drilling fluid operations began in 1998 with the
acquisition of Lone Star Mud, Inc., and Tejas Drilling Fluids, Inc. More
recently, in October 2000, Patterson acquired the fluids division of Ambar,
Inc., with drilling and completion fluids operations in the Gulf of Mexico,
Louisiana, and South Texas.

     Patterson had 3,062 employees at December 31, 2000. Patterson's
headquarters are located at 4510 Lamesa Highway, Snyder, Texas, and its
telephone number at that address is (915) 573-1104. Patterson also has small
offices in Austin, Houston, Midland, San Angelo, Kilgore, LaGrange and Corpus
Christi, Texas, and Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, Vernal, Utah, Lafayette, Louisiana,
and Hobbs, New Mexico, and 26 yard and stockpoint facilities variously located
in its areas of operations.

    shares in each category.

(2) The total number of unexercised options held as of December 31, 2000,
    separated between those options that were exercisable and those options that
    were not exercisable.

(3) Calculated by subtracting actual option exercise price from market price at
    December 29, 2000 ($37.25 per share) and multiplying the difference by the
    number of shares in each category.

DIRECTOR COMPENSATION

     Each non-employee director of Patterson receives a $1,000 per month fee as
partial compensation for services as board members. In addition, pursuant to
Patterson's non-employee directors' stock option plan, each non-employee
director is automatically granted options to purchase 20,000 shares at the time
he becomes a director and, thereafter, options to purchase an additional 4,000
shares for each subsequent year that he serves up to a maximum of 40,000 shares
per director. The exercise price for each such option is the fair market value
of the Patterson common stock on the date of grant.

COMPENSATION COMMITTEE REPORT

     Under rules established by the Securities and Exchange Commission,
Patterson is required to provide certain information regarding the compensation
of its Chief Executive Officer and other executive officers whose salary and
bonus exceed $100,000 per year. Disclosure requirements include a report
explaining the rationale and considerations that lead to fundamental executive
compensation decisions. The following report has been prepared to fulfill this
requirement.

     The compensation committee sets and administers the policies that govern
the annual compensation and long-term compensation of executive officers of
Patterson. The compensation committee consists of Messrs. Gist, Rossi, Peak and
DeGroat, none of whom are employees of Patterson. The compensation committee
makes all decisions concerning compensation of executive officers who receive
salary and bonus in excess of $100,000 annually, determines the total amount of
bonuses to be paid annually and grants all awards of stock options under
Patterson's 1993 stock incentive plan. The compensation committee has retained
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP to provide executive compensation consulting services
to assist it in performing its various duties. PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP
prepared, in April 2000, a report comparing Patterson's cash compensation
practices for the executive officers to the executive-level cash compensation
practices of similarly-sized companies in Patterson's segment of the oil and
natural gas industry and in general industry.

     The compensation committee's policy is to offer executive officers
competitive compensation packages that will permit Patterson to attract and
retain highly qualified individuals and to motivate and reward such individuals
on the basis of Patterson's performance. At present, Patterson's executive
compensation package consists of base salary, cash bonus awards and long-term
incentive opportunities in the form of

stock options and a 401(k) plan. Executive salaries are reviewed by the
compensation committee on an annual basis and are set for individual executive
officers based on subjective evaluations of each individual's performance,
Patterson's performance and a comparison to salary ranges for executives of
other companies in the oil and natural gas industry with characteristics similar
to those of Patterson. This allows the compensation committee to set salaries in
a manner that is both competitive and reasonable within Patterson's industry.

     Cash bonuses may be awarded on an annual basis for exceptional effort and
performance. The use of a specific formula to evaluate management performance is
not employed because it is difficult to define an appropriate formula and it
restricts the flexibility of the compensation committee. The compensation
committee considers the achievements of Patterson, specifically including
earnings for the year and return on stockholders' equity in determining
appropriate levels for bonus awards. Currently, the base annual salary of each
of the executive officers named in the Summary Compensation Table above is
within the salary parameters set forth in the analysis prepared by
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP.

     Stock options may be granted to key employees under the Patterson Energy,
Inc. 1993 Stock Incentive Plan, including executive officers of Patterson. Such
stock-based awards continue to be an important element of the executive
compensation package because they aid in the objective of aligning the key
employees' interests with those of the stockholders by giving key employees a
direct stake in the performance of Patterson. Decisions concerning the granting
of stock options are made on the same basis as decisions concerning base salary
and cash bonus awards as discussed above. No options were granted in 2000 to any
of the executive officers of Patterson.

     The compensation of the Chief Executive Officer of Patterson is determined
in the same manner as the compensation for other executive officers as described
above. As a result, the compensation of the Chief Executive Officer is largely
dependent upon the overall performance of Patterson as well as a comparison to
compensation being paid by other comparable peer companies to their chief
executive officers. During the year 2000, the base annual salary of Mr. Talbott
was approximately $290,900.

                       Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors:

                         Kenneth R. Peak
                         Stephen J. DeGroat
                         Robert C. Gist
                         Vincent A. Rossi, Jr.

EMPLOYMENT CONTRACTS AND CHANGE-IN-CONTROL ARRANGEMENTS

     None of the executive officers named in the Summary Compensation Table
above has an employment or severance agreement or any plan or arrangement
providing compensation in the event of a change in control of Patterson.

COMPENSATION COMMITTEE INTERLOCKS AND INSIDER PARTICIPATION

     Robert C. Gist, Vincent A. Rossi, Jr. Stephen J. DeGroat and Kenneth R.
Peak served as members of the compensation committee during 2000. Except in his
capacity as a manager of a subsidiary LLC of Patterson for which he receives no
compensation, Mr. Gist has never served as an officer, but has been paid a
monthly retainer of $1,000 since 1993 for legal and consulting services.
Patterson also pays premiums for Mr. Gist's family health insurance coverage.
Messrs. DeGroat, Peak and Rossi have not served as an officer of Patterson.
After joining the board in November 2000, Messrs. Peak and DeGroat were
appointed by the board to the compensation committee and the audit committee.

CERTAIN RELATIONSHIPS AND RELATED TRANSACTIONS

     Patterson leases a 1981 Beech King-Air 90 airplane owned by an affiliate of
Patterson's Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer. Under the terms
of the lease, Patterson pays a monthly rental of

$9,200 and its proportionate share of the costs of fuel, insurance, taxes and
maintenance of the aircraft. Patterson paid approximately $211,495, $222,583 and
$193,769 for the lease of the airplane during 1998, 1999 and 2000, respectively.

     Certain of Patterson's affiliated persons have participated, either
individually or through entities they control, in oil and gas prospects or
properties in which Patterson has an interest. Affiliated persons are directors,
executive officers and key employees of Patterson and their family members.
These participations, which have been on a working interest basis, have been in
prospects or properties originated or acquired by Patterson. In substantially
every property in which any of these affiliated persons has been a working
interest participant, Patterson also has sold working interests to nonaffiliated
persons on the same basis. At December 31, 2000, affiliated persons were working
interest owners in 127 of the 164 wells then being operated by Patterson. In
some cases, the interests sold to affiliated and nonaffiliated participants were
sold on a promoted basis requiring these participants to pay a portion of
Patterson's costs. Patterson believes that each of the participations by the
affiliated persons has been on terms no less favorable to Patterson than it
could have obtained from nonaffiliated participants. It is expected that joint
participations with Patterson will occur from time to time in the future.
Conflicts of interest may arise between such directors and officers and
Patterson as to the advisability of conducting drilling and recompletion
activities on those properties. As is the case of sale of working interests by
Patterson in its properties to nonaffiliated persons, sales of working interests
to affiliated persons are made to reduce Patterson's economic risk in the
properties.

     The following table sets forth production revenues received and joint
production costs paid by each of the affiliated persons during 2000 for all
wells operated by Patterson in which they have working interests. These numbers
do not necessarily represent their profits or losses from these interests
because the joint production costs do not include the parties' related drilling
and leasehold acquisition costs incurred prior to January 1, 2000.

                                                               YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31,

    Mr. Patterson's children share in equally and Mr. Patterson is the manager.

     Any future transactions between Patterson and its officers, directors, key
employees, 5% stockholders and their family members and affiliates will continue
to be subject to the approval of a majority of disinterested members of the
board of directors and will continue to be on terms no less favorable to
Patterson than those that could be negotiated with nonaffiliated parties. During
February 1994, the Patterson board of directors adopted a blanket policy
approving in advance all joint participations with affiliated persons in oil and
gas prospects and properties after that date, provided that the participations
of such affiliated persons are on the same basis as participations with
nonaffiliated persons. In those instances when there are no nonaffiliated
third-party participants, prior approval of the board of directors is required
on a participation-by-participation basis.

PERFORMANCE GRAPH

     The following graph shows the changes over the past approximate five-year
period beginning December 31, 1995, and ending December 31, 2000, in the value
of $100 invested in: (1) Patterson Energy, Inc. common stock; (2) an MG Group
Index consisting of 57 companies engaged in oil and gas field services (all
within SIC Code 1381); (3) the NASDAQ Market Index; and (4) a Peer Group Index
consisting of five companies who are principally engaged in providing contract
drilling services to the oil and natural gas industry. The year-end values of
each investment are based on share price appreciation and assume that $100 was
invested on December 31, 1995, and that all dividends are reinvested.
Calculations exclude trading commissions and taxes. The comparison in the graph
is required by the SEC and, therefore, is not intended to forecast or be
indicative of possible future performance of Patterson's common stock.

COMPLIANCE WITH SECTION 16(a) OF THE EXCHANGE ACT

     Section 16(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "1934
Act"), requires Patterson's officers and directors, and persons who own more
than 10% of a registered class of Patterson's equity securities, to file reports
of ownership and changes in ownership with the SEC. Each of these persons is
required by SEC regulation to furnish Patterson with copies of Section 16(a)
filings. Based solely on its review of copies of such forms received by it and
written representations from certain reporting persons that no Forms 5 were
required for those persons, Patterson believes that, during the fiscal year
ended December 31, 2000, its officers, directors, and greater than 10%
beneficial owners other than Messrs. Nelson and Armour, complied with all
applicable filing requirements. On December 28, 2000, Mr. Nelson sold 7,500
shares of Patterson common stock and exercised options to purchase 20,000 shares
of Patterson common stock. During March 2000, Mr. Armour sold calls on 3,600
shares of Patterson. Neither Mr. Nelson nor Mr. Armour filed Forms 4 with
respect to these transactions, nor have they filed Forms 5 with respect thereto
in 2001.

                              FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

     The following unaudited pro forma combined financial statements are
presented to give effect to the merger between Patterson and UTI based on the
pooling-of-interests method of accounting at the exchange ratio of one share of
Patterson common stock for each share of UTI common stock. The unaudited pro
forma balance sheet data are presented as if the merger was effective on
December 31, 2000. The unaudited pro forma statements of operations data are
presented as if the merger was effective as of the beginning of the earliest
period presented. You should not rely on the pro forma amounts as being
indicative of the financial position or the results of operations of
Patterson-UTI, the combined company, that would have actually occurred had the
merger been effective during the periods presented or of the future financial
position or future results of operations of the combined company.

     The unaudited pro forma combined statements of operations exclude
non-recurring charges directly attributable to the merger, estimated at pretax
$10 million, substantially all of which will be charged to operations in the
quarter in which the merger is consummated. The unaudited pro forma combined
balance sheet has been adjusted to reflect the assumed after-tax impact of such
non-recurring charges. You should read the condensed unaudited pro forma
combined financial statements in conjunction with the historical consolidated
financial statements and accompanying notes of Patterson and UTI incorporated by
reference in this document.

                           PATTERSON-UTI ENERGY, INC.

                          NOTES TO UNAUDITED PRO FORMA
                         COMBINED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

1. UNAUDITED PRO FORMA FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

     The accompanying unaudited pro forma combined financial statements have
been prepared using the pooling-of-interests method of accounting to present the
merger between Patterson and UTI. The basis of the unaudited pro forma combined
balance sheet reflects the conversion of each outstanding share of UTI common
stock into one share of Patterson common stock (an exchange ratio of 1:1). The
unaudited pro forma combined statements of operations reflect the conversion of
the historical number of shares of UTI common stock outstanding used in
computing earnings per share into Patterson common stock using the exchange
ratio of 1:1. The actual number of shares to be issued in the merger will be
determined by the actual number of shares of UTI common stock outstanding at the
effective time of the merger. The merger agreement obligates Patterson to assume
UTI stock options outstanding under UTI stock option plans in effect on the date
of the merger agreement and also to assume UTI warrants outstanding at that
time. Common stock equivalents have been considered in the net income (loss) per
common share calculation for each of the three years ended December 31, 2000,
1999 and 1998.

2. PERIODS PRESENTED

     The unaudited pro forma combined financial statements were prepared using
the audited historical consolidated financial statements of both Patterson and
UTI. The unaudited pro forma combined balance sheet assumes the merger had been
consummated on December 31, 2000. The unaudited pro forma combined statement of
operations for each of the years in the three year period ended December 31,
2000 assumes that the merger had been consummated on January 1, 1998.

3. PRO FORMA ADJUSTMENTS

     The following adjustments were made to conform the accounting methods of
Patterson and UTI and to recognize the estimated costs associated with the
merger.

     a. To adjust for certain differences between the two companies' relative
methods of accounting for the recognition of revenue under turnkey drilling
contract arrangements. Patterson applies the completed contract method to
turnkey drilling contracts which requires revenue and costs associated with
drilling the well to be deferred until drilling is complete. UTI accounts for
its turnkey arrangements using the percentage-of-completion method in which
revenue is recognized as costs are incurred relative to the expected total cost
of drilling the well.

     b. To adjust for the difference in the par value per share for the common
stock issued upon consummation of the merger. Patterson's par value of common
stock is $0.01 per share and UTI's par value is $0.001 per share.

     c. To reflect the estimated direct costs associated with the merger between
Patterson and UTI which are estimated to be $10 million (approximately $6.5
million net of income tax). These non-recurring costs, which are subject to
change, will be charged to operations in the quarter in which the merger is
consummated.

     d. To adjust diluted shares outstanding using Patterson's year end market
price.

                       COMPARISON OF STOCKHOLDERS' RIGHTS

     As a result of the merger, the holders of UTI common stock will become
holders of Patterson common stock. The rights of the stockholders of Patterson
will be governed by applicable Delaware law, including the Delaware General
Corporation Law, or DGCL, and by Patterson's restated certificate of
incorporation and bylaws.

     The following is a summary of the material differences between the rights
of Patterson stockholders and UTI stockholders. Because both Patterson and UTI
are organized under the laws of the State of Delaware, these differences arise
principally from differences between the Patterson restated certificate of
incorporation and the UTI restated certificate of incorporation, and differences
between Patterson's bylaws and UTI's bylaws.

     The following summaries do not provide a complete description of the
specific rights of Patterson stockholders under its restated certificate of
incorporation and bylaws as compared with the rights of UTI stockholders under
its restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws. The identification of
specific differences in the rights of these holders as material is not intended
to indicate that other equally important or more significant differences do not
exist. These summaries are qualified in their entirety by reference to the
governing corporate instruments of Patterson and UTI to which you are referred.

AUTHORIZED CAPITAL STOCK

     The total number of authorized shares of capital stock of Patterson is
51,000,000, consisting of 50,000,000 shares of common stock, par value $0.01 per
share, and 1,000,000 shares of preferred stock, par value $0.01 per share. In
connection with the merger, holders of Patterson common stock will vote on a
proposal to amend Patterson's restated certificate of incorporation to increase
the number of authorized shares of common stock to 200,000,000 shares.

     The total number of authorized shares of capital stock of UTI is
105,000,000, consisting of 100,000,000 shares of common stock, par value $0.001
per share, and 5,000,000 shares of preferred stock, par value $0.01 per share.

DIRECTORS

     Patterson's Board will be increased to 11 members at the effective time of
the merger. Of the 11 members to be named to the initial Patterson-UTI board,
Patterson will designate six and UTI will designate five.

     Under Section 141(b) of the DGCL, the number of directors shall be fixed
by, or in the manner provided in, the bylaws unless otherwise provided in the
certificate of incorporation. A director need not be a stockholder to be
qualified to serve as a director unless required by the certificate of
incorporation or bylaws. Section 141(d) of the DGCL permits a classified board
of directors with staggered terms under which one-half to one-third of the
directors are elected for terms of two or three years, respectively.

     The Patterson restated certificate of incorporation does not fix the number
of directors. The Patterson bylaws provide that the number of directors may be
fixed, changed by amendment to the bylaws or set by resolution of Patterson's
board. The number of directors of Patterson is currently set at seven, with each
director serving until the next annual meeting following his election and until
his successor is elected and qualified, or until his earlier resignation,
removal or death. Directors may not be elected by written consent of the
stockholders.

     The Patterson bylaws provide that individuals may be nominated for election
to Patterson's board at a meeting of Patterson stockholders (a) by or at the
direction of the Patterson board or (b) by a stockholder entitled to vote for
the election of directors who complies with certain notice procedures set forth
in the Patterson bylaws. Under those procedures, the stockholder must deliver or
mail notice to the Secretary of Patterson at the principal executive offices of
Patterson not less than 30 days nor more than 60 days prior to the stockholders'
meeting. In the event that Patterson gives the stockholder less than

40 days' written notice of the meeting, the stockholder must deliver the notice
no later than the close of business on the 10th day following the day on which
the notice of the date of the meeting was mailed.

     The Patterson bylaws also require that the stockholder include certain
information in the notice. A stockholder's notice must include (i) as to each
person whom the stockholder proposes to nominate for election or re-election as
director, all information relating to such person that is required to be
disclosed in solicitations of proxies for election of directors by the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, (ii) the stockholder's name and
record address, and (iii) the class and number of shares of Patterson that the
stockholder beneficially owns.

     If the presiding officer at the meeting determines that the nomination does
not comply with these requirements, he may declare that the defective nomination
will be disregarded.

     The UTI restated certificate of incorporation does not fix the number of
directors. The UTI bylaws provide that UTI's board may fix or change by
resolution the number of directors, subject to the right of UTI's stockholders
to change such number at any annual meeting, or at a special meeting called for
that purpose. UTI currently has seven directors. The seven directors are divided
into three separate classes, consisting, as nearly as possible, of equal numbers
of directors, with one class being elected annually. Directors serve terms of
three years until their successors are elected and qualified.

     As with Patterson, only persons nominated according to specified procedures
are eligible to serve as directors. UTI's bylaws provide that nominations of
persons for election to the UTI board may be made at a UTI stockholders' meeting
only (a) by or at the direction of the UTI board or (b) by a UTI stockholder
entitled to vote for the election of directors. As with Patterson, the UTI
bylaws specify procedures for nominating directors. A stockholder's notice must
be delivered to or mailed and received by UTI's principal executive offices not
less than 90 days nor more than 120 days prior to the anniversary date of the
immediately preceding annual stockholders' meeting. In the event that the annual
meeting is called for a date that is not within 30 days before or after this
anniversary date, the notice must be received by UTI no later than the close of
business on the 10th day following the day notice of the meeting date was mailed
or made public, whichever occurs first.

     The information required in the notice is identical to that required by
Patterson, except that it must also include (i) a description of all
arrangements or understandings between the nominating stockholder and each
proposed nominee, (ii) a representation that such stockholder intends to appear
in person or by proxy at the meeting to nominate the nominee, and (iii) a
written consent of each nominee to being named as a nominee and to serve as a
director if elected.

     As with Patterson, the chairman at the meeting of UTI stockholders may
declare that the stockholder nomination did not comply with procedure and
disregard the defective nomination.

REMOVAL OF DIRECTORS

     Section 141(k) of the DGCL provides that directors may be removed, with or
without cause, by a majority of shareholders entitled to vote in the election of
that director, unless the board of directors is classified. In that case, unless
provided otherwise in the certificate of incorporation, a director may be
removed only for cause.

     Under the Patterson bylaws, the holders of a majority of the shares may
remove with or without cause any one or more directors or the entire board.
UTI's restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws provide that neither
directors nor the entire board can be removed from office except for cause.

QUORUM AT MEETING OF DIRECTORS

     Section 141(b) of the DGCL provides that a quorum at a board of directors
meeting shall be not less than one-third of the directors.

     Patterson's bylaws define a quorum for the transaction of business at any
meeting as a majority of the whole authorized number of directors, except that a
majority of the directors then in office shall constitute a quorum for filling a
vacancy on the board.

     UTI's bylaws provide that a majority of the directors at that time in
office shall constitute a quorum for the transaction of business at any meeting.

SPECIAL STOCKHOLDER MEETINGS

     Under Section 211(d) of the DGCL, special meetings of stockholders may be
called by the board of directors or by such other persons authorized to do so by
the corporation's certificate of incorporation or bylaws.

     The Patterson restated certificate of incorporation provides that special
meetings of stockholders may be called by the majority of the board of
directors, the Chief Executive Officer, the President, or the holders of a
majority of the outstanding common stock of Patterson. The UTI bylaws provide
that only the majority of the board of directors, the Chairman of the Board, or
the President may call a special meeting of stockholders.

NOTICE OF MEETING OF THE STOCKHOLDERS

     Section 222(a) of the DGCL provides that stockholders will receive written
notice of any meeting where they are required or permitted to take any action.

     Patterson's bylaws require that Patterson provide notice of stockholder
meetings by personal delivery or by mail. Under its bylaws, UTI may deliver
notice of stockholder meetings by personal delivery, mail, telegraph or cable.

STOCKHOLDER ACTION WITHOUT A MEETING

     Under Section 228 of the DGCL, unless otherwise provided in the certificate
of incorporation, stockholders may take any action without a meeting if a
written consent is signed by the holders of outstanding stock having not less
than the minimum number of votes that would be required to authorize or take
such action at a meeting if all shares were present and voted.

     The Patterson restated certificate of incorporation prohibits taking
stockholder actions without a meeting. UTI's bylaws provide that any action that
may be taken at a stockholders' meeting may be taken through the written consent
if signed by the holders of all of the outstanding UTI common stock.

STOCKHOLDER PROPOSALS

     The Patterson bylaws provide that a stockholder may propose business to be
brought before a stockholders' meeting if certain requirements are satisfied.
Patterson must receive notice of the proposed business at its principal
executive offices not less than 30 days nor more than 60 days prior to the
meeting as originally scheduled. In the event that less than 40 days' notice of
a meeting is given, the notice must be received not later than the close of
business on the 10th day following the day on which the notice of the meeting
was mailed.

     Patterson bylaws also require that the notice of proposed business contain
certain information. A stockholder's notice must set forth (i) a brief
description of each matter desired to be brought before the annual meeting, (ii)
the name and record address of the stockholder proposing such business, (iii)
the class and number of shares beneficially owned by the stockholder, and (iv)
any material interest the stockholder may have in the proposed business.

     If the facts warrant, the presiding officer at the meeting may determine
that the stockholder's proposal did not comply with the required procedures and
declare that the business not be transacted.

     UTI stockholders may also propose business to be brought before a
stockholders' meeting. To be timely, a UTI stockholder's notice must be received
at UTI's principal executive offices not less than 90 days nor more than 120
days prior to the anniversary date of the immediately preceding annual
stockholders' meeting. In the event the annual meeting is called for a date that
is not within 30 days before or after such anniversary date, UTI must receive
the notice no later than the close of business on the 10th day following the
earlier of the day on which notice of the meeting date was mailed or the day it
was publicly announced.

     The information required in the notice to UTI is identical to that required
by Patterson, except that it must also include (i) the reasons for conducting
such business at the annual meeting, and (ii) a representation that the
stockholder intends to appear in person or by proxy at the annual meeting to
bring the proposed business before the meeting.

     As with Patterson, the chairman of the meeting may determine that business
was not properly brought and declare that it shall not be transacted.

AMENDMENT TO CERTIFICATE OF INCORPORATION

     Under Section 242 of the DGCL, an amendment to the certificate of
incorporation requires the approval of the corporation's board and the
affirmative vote of a majority of the outstanding shares entitled to vote. In
addition, amendments that make changes relating to the capital stock by
increasing or decreasing the par value or the aggregate number of authorized
shares of a class, or otherwise adversely affecting the rights of such class,
must be approved by the majority vote of each class or series of stock affected,
even if such stock would not otherwise have such voting rights.

     The Patterson restated certificate of incorporation expressly authorizes
the Patterson board to adopt, amend or repeal any provisions in its restated
certificate of incorporation in a manner then allowed by law. The UTI restated
certificate of incorporation also expressly authorizes its board to adopt, amend
or repeal any provisions in its certificate of incorporation in a manner then
allowed by law. However, UTI's restated certificate of incorporation conditions
amending the provision establishing its classified board of directors upon the
approval by the holders of 66 2/3% of the shares of outstanding common stock
entitled to vote thereon.

RIGHTS PLAN

     Patterson and UTI have each adopted a stockholder rights plan. The rights
granted under the Patterson and UTI rights agreements have similar anti-takeover
effects, each causing substantial dilution to a person or group that attempts to
acquire, or merge with, either company without conditioning the offer on the
rights being rendered inapplicable.

     In January 1997, the board of directors of Patterson adopted a stockholder
rights plan under which stockholders of record as of January 17, 1997 received a
dividend in the form of preferred share purchase rights (the "Patterson
Rights"). The Patterson Rights permit the holder to purchase one one-hundredth
of a share (a unit) of Series A preferred stock at an initial exercise price of
$41.50 per share under certain circumstances. The purchase price, the number of
units of preferred stock and the type of securities issuable upon exercise of
the Patterson Rights are subject to adjustment. The Patterson board of directors
is authorized to approve the issuance of one or more series of preferred stock
without further authorization of the stockholders and to fix the number of
shares, the designations, rights, privileges, restrictions and conditions of any
such series.

     The Patterson Rights expire on January 2, 2007 unless earlier redeemed or
exchanged. Until a Patterson Right is exercised, the holder thereof has no
rights as a stockholder of Patterson. The Patterson Rights become exercisable on
the earlier to occur of (i) the acquisition by a person or group of persons of
15% or more of the outstanding shares of Patterson common stock, or (ii) 10 days
following the commencement of, or the public announcement of an intention to
make, a tender offer or exchange offer

that would result in a person or group beneficially owning 15% or more of the
outstanding shares of Patterson common stock.

     In February 1999, the UTI board of directors adopted a stockholder rights
plan through the declaration of a dividend of one preferred stock purchase right
(a "UTI Right") for each outstanding share of UTI common stock, and authorized
the issuance of one UTI Right for each share of UTI common stock that later
becomes outstanding prior to the distribution date (as hereinafter defined), the
date of redemption of the UTI Rights or the final expiration date of the UTI
Rights. The UTI Rights permit the holder to purchase one two-thousandth of a
share (a unit) of Series I preferred stock at an initial exercise price of
$21.25 per share under certain circumstances. The purchase price and the number
of shares of Series I preferred stock issuable upon exercise of the UTI Rights
are subject to adjustment. The holder of Series I preferred stock will be
entitled to a minimum preferential quarterly dividend payment of $1 per share
but will be entitled to an aggregate dividend of 1,000 times the dividend
declared per share of UTI common stock. In the event UTI liquidates, the holders
of the interests in Series I preferred stock will be entitled to a minimum
preferential liquidation payment of $100 per share but will be entitled to an
aggregate payment of 1,000 times the payment made per share of UTI common stock.
Each share of Series I preferred stock will have 1,000 votes, voting together
with the shares of UTI common stock. In the event UTI merges, consolidates or
effects another transaction in which shares of UTI common stock are exchanged,
each share of Series I preferred stock will be entitled to receive 1,000 times
the amount received per share of UTI common stock.

     The UTI Rights expire on February 26, 2009 unless the expiration date is
extended or unless UTI earlier redeems or exchanges the UTI Rights. Until a UTI
Right is exercised, the holder thereof has no rights as a stockholder of UTI.
The UTI Rights become exercisable on the distribution date, defined as the
earlier to occur of (i) ten (10) business days following a public announcement
that a person or group of persons have acquired 15% or more of the outstanding
shares of UTI common stock, or (ii) ten (10) business days following the
commencement of, or the public announcement of an intention to make, a tender
offer or exchange offer that would result in a person or group beneficially
owning 15% or more of the outstanding shares of UTI common stock.

     On February 9, 2001, UTI and Mellon Investor Services LLC, rights agent,
amended the UTI stockholder rights plan to provide that Patterson would not be
deemed to be an acquiring person for purposes of the rights plan. The amendment
also provided that no distribution date would occur, the provisions of Section
13 of the rights plan would not take effect and the UTI Rights would not be
exercisable as a result of the execution and delivery of the merger agreement or
the consummation of the merger.

                       PROPOSED AMENDMENTS TO PATTERSON'S
                     RESTATED CERTIFICATE OF INCORPORATION

ADDITIONAL AUTHORIZED COMMON STOCK PROPOSAL

     Patterson's board of directors has approved a proposal authorizing an
amendment to Patterson's restated certificate of incorporation to increase the
authorized shares of Patterson's common stock from 50,000,000 to 200,000,000.

     This proposed amendment, if approved by the Patterson stockholders at the
Patterson special meeting, would take effect only if the merger proposal is also
adopted by the Patterson stockholders at the special meeting. The form of
certificate of amendment to effect this increase is attached to this joint proxy
statement/prospectus as Annex D.

     Patterson does not have a sufficient number of authorized, but unissued,
shares of common stock to effect the merger. Therefore, approval of this
proposed amendment is a prerequisite to approval of the proposal for the merger.

     The following table sets forth the number of issued, outstanding, and
reserved shares of Patterson common stock on March 13, 2001, the record date for
the Patterson special meeting, and the number of shares of Patterson common
stock that will be issued, outstanding, and reserved if the amendment is
approved and the merger is consummated:

                                                                  NUMBER OF SHARES
                                                              ------------------------
                                                                BEFORE        AFTER
                                                                MERGER       MERGER
                                                              ----------   -----------

Authorized..................................................  50,000,000   200,000,000
Issued and outstanding......................................
Reserved:
  Patterson stock options...................................
  UTI stock options and warrants (substituted options and
     warrants)..............................................
Unissued and unreserved.....................................

     The unissued and unreserved Patterson common shares would be available for
issuance from time to time as may be necessary in connection with:

     - future financings,

     - acquisitions,

     - transactions,

     - stock dividends,

     - stock splits,

     - distributions,

     - stock option plans,

     - other employee benefit plans, and

     - other corporate purposes.

     Patterson currently has no plans to issue any of these unissued and
unreserved shares.

     The additional authorized shares of Patterson common stock would have the
same rights and privileges as the shares of Patterson common stock currently
outstanding. Holders of shares of Patterson

common stock have no preemptive rights to subscribe for any additional shares of
Patterson common stock.

     Under Delaware law, the Patterson board of directors generally may issue
authorized but unissued shares of common stock without stockholder approval. The
board does not intend to seek stockholder approval prior to any future issuance
of the shares, except to the extent otherwise required by Patterson's restated
certificate of incorporation, by law or by the Nasdaq National Market or any
securities exchange on which the Patterson common stock may be listed at that
time.

     The authorization of additional shares of Patterson common stock will
enable Patterson, as the need may arise, to take timely advantage of market
conditions and of favorable opportunities without the delay and expense
associated with the holding of a special meeting of its stockholders or of
waiting for the regularly scheduled annual stockholders meeting in order to
increase the authorized shares of Patterson common stock. Patterson stockholders
will have no preemptive rights to purchase shares of Patterson common stock
issued in the merger or in the future.

     The increase in the authorized but unissued shares of Patterson's common
stock pursuant to the amendment could, under certain circumstances, have the
effect of deterring attempts to acquire control of Patterson. However, Patterson
believes that the increase in the number of authorized shares of common stock is
important to meet the future needs of Patterson. The proposed amendment is not
being presented as, nor is it part of, a plan to adopt a series of anti-takeover
measures. Patterson is unaware of any pending or proposed takeover attempt.

     Approval of this proposed amendment requires the affirmative vote of the
holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of Patterson's common stock. FOR
THE REASONS STATED ABOVE, THE PATTERSON BOARD OF DIRECTORS RECOMMENDS THAT
PATTERSON STOCKHOLDERS VOTE "FOR" THIS AMENDMENT.

NAME CHANGE PROPOSAL

     Patterson's board of directors has also approved a proposal to amend
Patterson's restated certificate of incorporation to change Patterson's
corporate name from Patterson Energy, Inc. to "Patterson-UTI Energy, Inc." This
proposed amendment, if approved by the Patterson stockholders at the Patterson
special meeting, would take effect only if the merger is consummated. Approval
of the name change amendment is not a prerequisite to approval of the merger.
The certificate of amendment to effect the name change is attached to this joint
proxy statement/prospectus as Annex E.

     Approval of this proposed amendment requires the affirmative vote of the
holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of Patterson's common stock. THE
PATTERSON BOARD OF DIRECTORS RECOMMENDS THAT PATTERSON STOCKHOLDERS VOTE "FOR"
THIS AMENDMENT.

                                 LEGAL MATTERS

     The validity of the shares of Patterson common stock to be issued in the
merger will be passed on for Patterson by Baker & Hostetler LLP, counsel to
Patterson. Certain tax consequences of the merger will be passed on for
Patterson by Baker & Hostetler LLP, and for UTI by Fulbright & Jaworski L.L.P.

                             STOCKHOLDER PROPOSALS

     Any Patterson stockholder, or if the merger is consummated, any
Patterson-UTI stockholder, who intends to present a proposal at Patterson's or
Patterson-UTI's, as the case may be, 2002 annual meeting of stockholders for
inclusion in the proxy statement and form of proxy relating to that meeting is
advised that the proposal must be received by Patterson or Patterson-UTI, as the
case may be, at its principal executive offices not later than December 31,
2001. Patterson or Patterson-UTI, as the case may be, will not be required to
include in its proxy statement a form of proxy or stockholder proposal that is
received after that date or that otherwise fails to meet the requirements for
stockholder proposals established by regulations of the SEC.

     In addition, any Patterson or Patterson-UTI stockholder, as the case may
be, desiring to raise a matter, including nominating an individual for election
as a director, at Patterson's or Patterson-UTI's, as the case may be, 2002
annual meeting of stockholders, where the stockholder has not sought inclusion
of the matter in its proxy statement and proxy relating to such meeting, must
comply with the advance notification provisions in Patterson's bylaws. Pursuant
to this advance notice provision, a stockholder's notice must be delivered to or
mailed and received at Patterson's or Patterson-UTI's, as the case may be,
principal executive offices not less than 30 days nor more than 60 days prior to
the meeting. However, in the event that less than 40 days' prior public
disclosure of the date of the meeting is made to stockholders, a notice by the
stockholder will be timely if it is received not later than the close of
business on the tenth day following the day on which the public disclosure was
made or notice of the date of the meeting was mailed, whichever first occurs.

     In the event that the merger is not consummated, any UTI stockholder who
intends to present a proposal at UTI's 2002 annual meeting of stockholders for
inclusion in the proxy statement and form of proxy relating to that meeting is
advised that the written proposal and any written statement in support of the
proposal must be received by the Secretary of UTI at the principal executive
offices not later than January 31, 2002. UTI will not be required to include in
its proxy statement a form of proxy or stockholder proposal that is received
after that date or that otherwise fails to meet the requirements for stockholder
proposals established by regulations of the SEC. If the merger is consummated as
currently contemplated, there will not be a 2002 annual meeting of UTI
stockholders.

     In addition, any UTI stockholder desiring to raise a matter, including
nominating an individual for election as a director, at UTI's 2002 annual
meeting of stockholders, where the stockholder has not sought inclusion of the
matter in its proxy statement and proxy relating to such meeting, must comply
with the advance notification provisions in UTI's bylaws. Such provisions
require that notice of stockholder matters be raised at an annual stockholders
meeting and be received by UTI's Secretary not later than the tenth day
following the date on which notice of the date of an annual meeting of
stockholders for 2002 is mailed or public disclosure of the date of the meeting
of stockholders is made, whichever first occurs. A stockholder who desires to
raise such matters should contact UTI's Secretary for the specific requirements
prescribed by the bylaws.

     AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER, dated as of February 4, 2001 (this
"Agreement"), between PATTERSON ENERGY, INC., a Delaware corporation ("PEC"),
and UTI ENERGY CORP., a Delaware corporation ("UTI") (PEC and UTI being
hereinafter collectively referred to as the "Constituent Corporations").

                                  WITNESSETH:

     WHEREAS, the respective Boards of Directors of PEC and UTI have approved
and declared fair to and advisable and in the best interests of their respective
stockholders the merger of PEC and UTI (the "Merger"), upon the terms and
subject to the conditions set forth herein, whereby the issued and outstanding
shares of Common Stock, par value $0.001 per share, of UTI ("UTI Common Stock")
not owned directly by UTI, will be converted into shares of Common Stock, par
value $.01 per share, of PEC ("PEC Common Stock" or "Surviving Corporation
Common Stock");

     WHEREAS, for federal income tax purposes, it is intended that the Merger
shall qualify as a reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the
Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code");

     WHEREAS, it is intended that the Merger shall be recorded for accounting
purposes as a pooling of interests, but such accounting treatment is not a
condition to the Merger; and

     WHEREAS, PEC and UTI desire to make certain representations, warranties and
agreements in connection with the Merger and also to prescribe various
conditions to the Merger.

     NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and the representations,
warranties and agreements herein contained, the parties agree as follows:

                                   ARTICLE I

hereof, and in accordance with the General Corporation Law of the State of
Delaware (the "DGCL"), UTI shall be merged with and into PEC at the Effective
Time (as hereinafter defined). Following the Merger, the separate corporate
existence of UTI shall cease and PEC shall continue as the surviving corporation
(the "Surviving Corporation") and shall succeed to and assume all the rights and
obligations of UTI in accordance with the DGCL.

     SECTION 1.2  Effective Time.  The Merger shall become effective when the
Certificate of Merger (the "Certificate of Merger"), executed in accordance with
the relevant provisions of the DGCL, is filed with the Secretary of State of the
State of Delaware, provided, however, that, upon mutual consent of the
Constituent Corporations, the Certificate of Merger may provide for a later date
of effectiveness of the Merger not more than 30 days after the date the
Certificate of Merger is filed. When used in this Agreement, the term "Effective
Time" shall mean the later of the date and time at which the Certificate of
Merger is accepted for record or such later time established by the Certificate
of Merger. The filing of the Certificate of Merger shall be made as soon as
practicable after the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions to the Merger set
forth herein.

     SECTION 1.3  Effects of the Merger.  The Merger shall have the effects set
forth in Section 259 of the DGCL.

     SECTION 1.4  Certificate of Incorporation.  The Certificate of
Incorporation, as amended, of PEC, as in effect immediately prior to the
Effective Time, shall be the Certificate of Incorporation of the Surviving
Corporation until thereafter changed or amended as provided therein or by
applicable law, except that Article First shall be amended to change the name of
the Surviving Corporation to Patterson-UTI

Energy, Inc. and Article Fourth shall be amended to increase the number of
authorized shares of PEC common Stock from 50,000,000 shares to 150,000,000
shares, with the first sentence of Article Fourth amended to read in its
entirety as follows:

             "The total number of shares of stock that the Corporation
        shall have authority to issue is one hundred and fifty-one
        million (151,000,000) shares, of which one hundred and fifty
        million (150,000,000) shares shall be Common Stock, having a par
        value of $0.01 per share, and one million (1,000,000) shares
        shall be Preferred Stock, having a par value of $0.01 per
        share."

     SECTION 1.5  Bylaws.  The Bylaws of PEC, as in effect immediately prior to
the Effective Time, shall be the Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation until
thereafter changed or amended as provided therein by applicable law.

     SECTION 1.6  Directors.  At the Effective Time, the number of directors
comprising the full Board of Directors of the Surviving Corporation shall be
increased to eleven members, with six members to be designated by the PEC Board
of Directors and five members to be designated by the UTI Board of Directors,

their respective successors have been duly elected or appointed in accordance
with the Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation or
by applicable law.

     SECTION 1.7  Conversion of Shares.  As of the Effective Time, by virtue of
the Merger and without any action on the part of any stockholder of UTI:

          (a) All shares of UTI Common Stock that are held in the treasury of
     UTI shall be canceled and no capital stock of PEC or other consideration
     shall be delivered in exchange therefor.

          (b) Subject to the provisions of Sections 1.10 and 1.12 hereof, each
     share of UTI Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
     Effective Time (other than shares to be canceled in accordance with Section
     1.7(a)) shall be converted into 1.0 share (the "Exchange Ratio") of validly
     issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of Common Stock, par value $0.01
     per share, of Surviving Corporation Common Stock. Pursuant to the Rights
     Agreement between PEC and Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company, as
     Rights Agent, dated January 2, 1997 ("PEC Rights Agreement"), each share of
     Surviving Corporation Common Stock shall be accompanied by a right under
     the Surviving Corporation Rights Agreement. All such shares of UTI Common
     Stock, when so converted, shall no longer be outstanding and shall
     automatically be canceled and retired and each holder of a Certificate (as
     defined in Section 1.8(a)) representing any such shares shall cease to have
     any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive certain
     dividends and other distributions as contemplated by Section 1.9 and shares
     of Surviving Corporation Common Stock and any cash, without interest, in
     lieu of fractional shares to be issued or paid in consideration therefor
     upon the surrender of such Certificate in accordance with Section 1.8.

          (c) Each then outstanding share of Surviving Corporation Common Stock
     shall continue to be an issued and outstanding share of Surviving
     Corporation Common Stock, and any share of Surviving Corporation Common
     Stock held in PEC's treasury immediately prior to the Effective Time and
     not issued in the Merger shall continue to be held in the treasury of PEC
     at the Effective Time.

     SECTION 1.8  Surviving Corporation to Make Certificates Available.

     (a) Exchange of Certificates.  PEC and UTI shall authorize Continental
Stock Transfer & Trust Company, New York, New York (or such other person or
persons as shall be reasonably acceptable to PEC and UTI) to act as Exchange
Agent hereunder (the "Exchange Agent"). As soon as practicable after the
Effective Time, Surviving Corporation shall deposit with the Exchange Agent for
the benefit of the holders of certificates, which immediately prior to the
Effective Time represented shares of UTI Common Stock (the "Certificates"),
certificates representing the shares of Surviving Corporation Common Stock (such
shares of Surviving Corporation Common Stock, together with any dividends or
distributions

                                       A-2

with respect thereto payable as provided in Section 1.9, being hereinafter
referred to as the "Exchange Fund") issuable pursuant to Section 1.7(c) in
exchange for outstanding shares of UTI Common Stock and associated rights.

     (b) Exchange Procedures.  Promptly after the Effective Time, the Exchange
Agent shall mail to each holder of record of a Certificate whose shares were
converted pursuant to Section 1.7 into shares of Surviving Corporation Common
Stock a letter of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be
effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon
actual and proper delivery of the Certificates to the Exchange Agent and shall
contain instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates in
exchange for certificates representing shares of Surviving Corporation Common
Stock and shall be in such form and contain such other provisions as PEC and UTI
may reasonably specify). Upon surrender of a Certificate for cancellation to the
Exchange Agent, together with such letter of transmittal, duly executed, the
holder of such Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor a
certificate representing that number of whole shares of Surviving Corporation
Common Stock which such holder has the right to receive pursuant to this Article
I, and the Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be canceled. Until
surrendered as contemplated by this Section 1.8, each Certificate shall, at and
after the Effective Time, be deemed to represent only the right to receive, upon
surrender of such Certificate, the certificate representing the appropriate
number of shares of Surviving Corporation Common Stock, cash in lieu of
fractional shares, if any, as provided in Section 1.10 and certain dividends and
other distributions as contemplated by Section 1.9.

     SECTION 1.9  Dividends; Transfer Taxes.  No dividends or other
distributions that may be declared on or after the Effective Time on Surviving
Corporation Common Stock or are payable to the holders of record thereof on or
after the Effective Time will be paid to persons entitled by reason of the
Merger to receive certificates representing Surviving Corporation Common Stock
until such persons surrender their Certificates, as provided in Section 1.8, and
no cash payment in lieu of fractional shares shall be paid to any such holder
pursuant to Section 1.10 until such holder of such Certificate shall so
surrender such Certificate. Subject to the effect of applicable law, there shall
be paid to the record holder of the certificates representing such Surviving
Corporation Common Stock (i) at the time of such surrender or as promptly as
practicable thereafter, the amount of any dividends or other distributions
theretofore paid with respect to whole shares of such Surviving Corporation
Common Stock and having a record date on or after the Effective Time and a
payment date prior to such surrender and (ii) at the appropriate payment date or
as promptly as practicable thereafter, the amount of dividends or other
distributions payable with respect to whole shares of Surviving Corporation
Common Stock and having a record date on or after the Effective Time but prior
to surrender and a payment date subsequent to surrender. In no event shall the
person entitled to receive such dividends or other distributions be entitled to
receive interest on such dividends or other distributions. If any cash or
certificate representing shares of Surviving Corporation Common Stock is to be
paid to or issued in a name other than that in which the Certificate surrendered
in exchange therefor is registered, it shall be a condition of such exchange
that the Certificate so surrendered shall be properly endorsed and otherwise in
proper form for transfer and that the person requesting such exchange shall pay
to the Exchange Agent any transfer or other taxes required by reason of the
issuance of certificates for such shares of Surviving Corporation Common Stock
in a name other than that of the registered holder of the Certificate
surrendered, or shall establish to the satisfaction of the Exchange Agent that
such tax has been paid or is not applicable.

     SECTION 1.10  No Fractional Shares.  No certificates or scrip representing
fractional shares of Surviving Corporation Common Stock shall be issued upon the
surrender for exchange of Certificates pursuant to this Article I, and no PEC
dividend or other distribution or stock split or combination shall relate to any
fractional security, and such fractional interests shall not entitle the owner
thereof to vote or to any rights of a security holder of PEC. In lieu of any
such fractional securities, each holder of shares of UTI Common Stock who would
otherwise have been entitled to receive a fraction of a share of Surviving
Corporation Common Stock (after taking into account all shares of UTI Common
Stock then held of record by such holder) shall receive cash (without interest)
in an amount equal to the product of such fractional part of a share of UTI
Common Stock multiplied by the Closing Price. As used in this
                                       A-3

Agreement, (i) "Closing Price" means the average of the midpoint of the daily
high and low trading prices of Surviving Corporation Common Stock, rounded to
four decimal places, as reported under Nasdaq National Market Issues Reports in
The Wall Street Journal for each of the first 20 consecutive Trading Days in the
period commencing twenty-five (25) Trading Days prior to the date of the Closing
and (ii) "Trading Day" means a day on which the National Association of
Securities Dealers, Inc. National Market ("Nasdaq National Market") is open for
trading.

     SECTION 1.11  Return of Exchange Fund.  Any portion of the Exchange Fund
which remains undistributed to the former stockholders of UTI for one year after
the Effective Time shall be delivered to Surviving Corporation, upon demand of
Surviving Corporation, and any former stockholders of UTI who have not
theretofore complied with this Article I shall thereafter look only to Surviving
Corporation for payment of their claim for Surviving Corporation Common Stock,
any cash in lieu of fractional shares of Surviving Corporation Common Stock and
any dividends or distributions with respect to Surviving Corporation Common
Stock. None of PEC, UTI nor the Surviving Corporation shall be liable to any
holder of shares of UTI Common Stock for shares (or dividends or distributions
with respect thereto) or cash in lieu of fractional shares of Surviving
Corporation Common Stock delivered to a public official pursuant to any
applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar law.

     SECTION 1.12  Adjustment of Exchange Ratio.  In the event of any
reclassification, recapitalization, stock split, stock combination, stock
dividend or share exchange with respect to PEC Common Stock or UTI Common Stock,
as the case may be, (or if a record date with respect to any of the foregoing
should occur) prior to the Effective Time, appropriate and proportionate
adjustments, if any, shall be made to the Exchange Ratio, and all references to
the Exchange Ratio in this Agreement shall be deemed to be to the Exchange Ratio
as so adjusted.

     SECTION 1.13  No Further Ownership Rights in UTI Common Stock.  All shares
of Surviving Corporation Common Stock issued upon the surrender for exchange of
Certificates in accordance with the terms hereof (including any cash paid
pursuant to Sections 1.9 or 1.10) shall be deemed to have been issued in full
satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the shares of UTI Common Stock,
subject, however, to the Surviving Corporation's obligation to pay any dividends
or make any other distribution with a record date prior to the Effective Time
which may have been declared or made by UTI on such shares of UTI Common Stock
in accordance with the terms of this Agreement.

     SECTION 1.14  Closing of UTI Transfer Books.  At the Effective Time, the
stock transfer books of UTI shall be closed and no transfer of shares of UTI
Common Stock shall thereafter be made. If, after the Effective Time,
Certificates are presented to the Surviving Corporation, they shall be canceled
and exchanged as provided in this Article I.

     SECTION 1.15  Further Assurances.  If at any time after the Effective Time
the Surviving Corporation shall consider or be advised that any deeds, bills of
sale, assignments or assurances or any other acts or things are necessary,
desirable or proper (a) to vest, perfect or confirm, of record or otherwise, in
the Surviving Corporation, its right, title or interest in, to or under any of
the rights, privileges, powers, franchises, properties or assets of either of
the Constituent Corporations, or (b) otherwise to carry out the purposes of this
Agreement, the Surviving Corporation and its proper officers and directors or
their designees shall be authorized to execute and deliver, in the name and on
behalf of either of the Constituent Corporations in the Merger, all such deeds,
bills of sale, assignments and assurances and do, in the name and on behalf of
such Constituent Corporations, all such other acts and things necessary,
desirable or proper to vest, perfect or confirm its right, title or interest in,
to or under any of the rights, privileges, powers, franchises, properties or
assets of such Constituent Corporation and otherwise to carry out the purposes
of this Agreement.

     SECTION 1.16  Closing.  The closing of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement (the "Closing") shall take place at the offices of Baker &
Hostetler LLP, 1000 Louisiana, Suite 2000, Houston, Texas 77002-5009, at 10:00
a.m. local time, on the second business day after the day on which the last of
the conditions set forth in Article VI hereof shall have been fulfilled or
waived or at such other time and place as PEC and UTI shall agree.
                                       A-4

                                   ARTICLE II

                     REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF PEC

     PEC represents and warrants to UTI as follows:

     SECTION 2.1  Organization, Standing and Power.  PEC is a corporation duly
incorporated, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the
jurisdiction of its incorporation and has the requisite corporate power and
authority to own, lease and operate its properties and to carry on its business
as now being conducted. Each Subsidiary of PEC is a limited liability company or
a limited liability limited partnership duly organized validly existing and in
good standing under the laws of the jurisdiction of its organization and has the
requisite limited liability company or limited partnership power and authority,
as the case may be, to own and operate its properties and to carry on its
business as now being conducted. PEC and each of its Subsidiaries is duly
qualified to do business, and is in good standing, in each jurisdiction where
the character of its properties owned or held under lease or the nature of its
activities makes such qualification necessary, except where the failure to be so
qualified would not, individually or in the aggregate, have a Material Adverse
Effect on PEC. For purposes of this Agreement (a) "Material Adverse Change" or
"Material Adverse Effect" means, when used with respect to PEC or UTI, as the
case may be, any change or effect that is or, so far as can reasonably be
determined, is likely to be materially adverse to the assets, properties,
condition (financial or otherwise), business or results of operations of PEC and
its Subsidiaries taken as a whole or UTI and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole,
as the case may be, and (b) "Subsidiary" means any corporation, partnership,
joint venture, limited liability company or other legal entity of which PEC or
UTI, as the case may be (either alone or through or together with any other
Subsidiary), owns, directly or indirectly, 50% or more of the stock or other
equity interests the holders of which are generally entitled to vote for the
election of the board of directors or other governing body of such corporation
or other legal entity. Section 2.1 of the disclosure statement of PEC dated as
of the date hereof previously furnished to UTI (the "PEC Disclosure Schedule")
contains a list of PEC's Subsidiaries.

     SECTION 2.2  Capital Structure.  As of the date hereof, the authorized
capital stock of PEC consists of 50,000,000 shares of PEC Common Stock and
1,000,000 shares of Preferred Stock, par value $0.01 per share ("PEC Preferred
Stock"). Except as set forth in Section 2.2 of the PEC Disclosure Schedule, all
of the outstanding equity securities of each Subsidiary of PEC is owned by PEC
directly or indirectly, free and clear of any Lien (as defined in Section 2.10),
including any restriction on the right to vote, sell or otherwise dispose of
such equity securities. At the close of business on February 2, 2001, (i)
38,014,326 shares of PEC Common Stock were validly issued and outstanding, fully
paid and nonassessable and free of preemptive rights, (ii) 1,792,520 shares of
PEC Common Stock were reserved for issuance upon the exercise of options for PEC
Common Stock then outstanding under the PEC 1993 Stock Incentive Plan and
Non-Employee Directors' Stock Option Plan (collectively, the "PEC Stock Plans"),
(iii) 30,900 additional shares of PEC Common Stock were reserved for issuance
under the PEC Stock Plans, (iv) 127,000 shares of PEC Common Stock were reserved
for issuance upon the exercise of warrants granted as partial consideration for
certain acquired drilling assets (the "PEC Warrants") (v) 300,000 shares of PEC
Common Stock were held by PEC in its treasury, and (vi) no shares of PEC
Preferred Stock were issued and outstanding or reserved for issuance. There are
no outstanding stock appreciation rights ("SARs"). PEC Common Stock is
designated as a national market security on an interdealer quotation system by
the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. All of the shares of
Surviving Corporation Common Stock issuable in exchange for UTI Common Stock at
the Effective Time in accordance with this Agreement and issuable upon exercise
of Substituted Options (as defined in Section 5.7) or Substituted Warrants (as
defined in Section 5.8) will be, when so issued, duly authorized, validly
issued, fully paid and nonassessable and free of preemptive rights. Except for
options granted pursuant to the PEC Stock Plans, the PEC Warrants and the Rights
issued pursuant to the PEC Rights Agreement, there are no options, warrants,
rights, commitments, agreements, arrangements or undertakings of any kind to
which PEC or any of its Subsidiaries is a party or by which any of them is bound
obligating PEC or any of its Subsidiaries to issue, deliver or sell, or cause to
be issued, delivered or sold, additional equity securities or other voting
securities of PEC or of any of its Subsidiaries. True and correct copies of
                                       A-5

all agreements, instruments and other governing documents relating to the PEC
Stock Plans and the PEC Rights Agreement have been furnished to UTI.

     SECTION 2.3  Authority; Non-Contravention.  The Board of Directors of PEC
has declared the Merger and an amendment to PEC's Certificate of Incorporation
to increase the number of authorized shares of PEC Common Stock to 150,000,000
shares (the "Charter Amendment") fair to and advisable and in the best interests
of the stockholders of PEC. PEC has all requisite power and authority to enter
into this Agreement and, subject to the approval of the Merger and the Charter
Amendment by the stockholders of PEC, to consummate the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated hereby. The execution and delivery by PEC of this
Agreement and any Stock Option Assumption Agreements (as defined in Section 5.7)
or Warrant Assumption Agreements (as defined in Section 5.8) and the
consummation by PEC of the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby have
been duly authorized by all necessary corporate action on the part of PEC,
subject to such approval of the Merger and the Charter Amendment by the
stockholders of PEC. This Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by PEC
and (assuming the valid authorization, execution and delivery of this Agreement
by UTI) constitutes a valid and binding obligation of PEC enforceable against
PEC in accordance with its terms, except to the extent enforceability may be
limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium, fraudulent
transfer or other similar laws of general applicability relating to or affecting
the enforcement of creditors' rights and by the effect of general principles of
equity (regardless of whether enforceability is considered in a proceeding in
equity or at law). The Merger, the Charter Amendment and the filing of a
registration statement with the SEC by PEC on Form S-4 under the Securities Act
of 1933, as amended (together with the rules and regulations promulgated
thereunder, the "Securities Act"), for the purpose of registering the shares of
PEC Common Stock to be issued in the Merger (together with any amendments or
supplements thereto, the "S-4 Registration Statement"), and the filing of a
registration statement with the SEC by PEC on Form S-8 under the Securities Act
for the purpose of registering the shares of PEC Common Stock issuable upon
exercise of the Substituted Options (as hereinafter defined in Section 5.7) have
been duly authorized by PEC's Board of Directors. Except as set forth in Section
2.3 of the PEC Disclosure Schedule, the execution and delivery of this Agreement
or any Stock Option Assumption Agreements or Warrant Assumption Agreements, do
not or will not, as the case may be, and the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby and thereby and compliance with the provisions hereof and
thereof will not, conflict with, or result in any violation of, or default (with
or without notice or lapse of time, or both) under, or give rise to a right of
termination, cancellation or acceleration of any obligation or to the loss of a
material benefit under, or result in the creation of any lien, security
interest, charge or encumbrance upon any of the properties or assets of PEC or
any of its Subsidiaries under, any provision of (i) the Restated Certificate of
Incorporation, as amended, or Bylaws (true and complete copies of which as of
the date hereof have been delivered to UTI) of PEC or any provision of the
comparable charter or organization documents of any of its Subsidiaries, (ii)
any loan or credit agreement, note, bond, mortgage, indenture, lease or other
agreement, instrument, permit, concession, franchise or license applicable to
PEC or any of its Subsidiaries or (iii) any judgment, order, decree, statute,
law, ordinance, rule or regulation applicable to PEC or any of its Subsidiaries
or any of their respective properties or assets, other than, in the case of
clauses (ii) or (iii), any such conflicts, violations, defaults, rights, losses,
liens, security interests, charges or encumbrances that, individually or in the
aggreg ate, would not have a Material Adverse Effect on PEC, materially impair
the ability of PEC to perform its obligations hereunder or under the Stock
Option Assumption Agreements or Warrant Assumption Agreements, or prevent the
consummation of any of the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby. Except
as set forth in Section 2.3 of the PEC Disclosure Schedule, no filing or
registration with, or authorization, consent or approval of, any domestic
(federal and state), foreign or supranational court, commission, governmental
body, regulatory agency, authority or tribunal (a "Governmental Entity") is
required by or with respect to PEC or any of its Subsidiaries in connection with
the execution and delivery of this Agreement by PEC or is necessary for the
consummation by PEC of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by
this Agreement and the issuance of PEC Common Stock pursuant to the Stock Option
Assumption Agreements or Warrant Assumption Agreements, except for (i) in
connection, or in compliance, with the provisions of the Securities Act and the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as

                                       A-6

amended (together with the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, the
"Exchange Act"), (ii) the filing of the Certificate of Merger with the Secretary
of State of the State of Delaware and recording of the Certificate of Merger in
the appropriate county in Delaware after the filing thereof with the Secretary
of State of the State of Delaware and the filing or recording of appropriate
documents with the relevant authorities of other states in which UTI is
qualified to do business, (iii) such filings and consents as may be required
under any environmental, health or safety law or regulation pertaining to any
notification, disclosure or required approval triggered by the Merger or the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (iv) such filings as may be
required in connection with applicable taxes, (v) such consents, approvals,
orders, authorizations, registrations, declarations and filings as may be
required under the corporation, takeover or "Blue Sky" laws of various states,
(vi) such filings and approvals as may be required under Hart-Scott-Rodino
Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976 (the "HSR Act"), and (vii) such other
consents, orders, authorizations, registrations, declarations and filings the
failure of which to be obtained or made would not, individually or in the
aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect on PEC, materially impair the ability
of PEC to perform its obligations hereunder or prevent the consummation of any
of the transactions contemplated hereby.

     SECTION 2.4  SEC Documents.  PEC has filed all required documents with the
SEC since January 1, 1998 (the "PEC SEC Documents"). As of their respective
dates, the PEC SEC Documents complied in all material respects with the
requirements of the Securities Act or the Exchange Act, as the case may be, and
none of the PEC SEC Documents contained any untrue statement of a material fact
or omitted to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary
to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they
were made, not misleading. The consolidated financial statements of PEC included
in the PEC SEC Documents comply as to form in all material respects with
applicable accounting requirements and the published rules and regulations of
the SEC with respect thereto, have been prepared in accordance with generally
accepted accounting principles (except, in the case of the unaudited statements,
as permitted by Form 10-Q of the SEC) applied on a consistent basis during the
periods involved (except as may be indicated therein or in the notes thereto)
and fairly present the consolidated financial position of PEC and its
consolidated Subsidiaries as of the dates thereof and the consolidated results
of their operations and statements of cash flows for the periods then ended
(subject, in the case of unaudited statements, to normal year-end audit
adjustments and to any other adjustments described therein). There is no
liability or obligation of any kind, whether accrued, absolute, fixed or
contingent, of PEC or any Subsidiary of PEC which is required by generally
accepted accounting principles to be reflected or reserved against or otherwise
disclosed in the most recent financial statements of PEC included in the PEC SEC
Documents which is not so reflected or reserved against that individually or in
the aggregate would have a Material Adverse Effect on PEC. For purposes of this
Agreement, "PEC Balance Sheet" means the consolidated balance sheet as of
September 30, 2000, set forth in PEC's Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the
quarter ended September 30, 2000, and "PEC Balance Sheet Date" means September
30, 2000.

     SECTION 2.5  Engineering Reports.  All information supplied to M. Brian
Wallace, an independent petroleum engineer, by or on behalf of PEC and its
Subsidiaries that was material to such engineer's review of PEC's estimates of
oil and gas reserves attributable to the Oil and Gas Interests (as defined
below) of PEC and its Subsidiaries in connection with the preparation of the oil
and gas reserve engineering report concerning the Oil and Gas Interests of PEC
and its Subsidiaries as of December 31, 1999, reviewed by M. Brian Wallace (the
"PEC Engineering Report") was (at the time supplied or as modified or amended
prior to the issuance of the PEC Engineering Report) true and correct in all
material respects. For purposes of this Agreement "Oil and Gas Interests" means,
when used with respect to PEC and each of its Subsidiaries, direct and indirect

     thereunder) in the ordinary course of business consistent with past

     been in the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice), or

Schedule; (vi) no issues that have been raised in writing by the relevant taxing
authority in connection with the examination of the Tax Returns referred to in

foreign income, gross receipts, property, sales, use, license, excise,
franchise, employment, payroll, withholding, alternative or added minimum, ad

the PEC Disclosure Schedule, PEC or its Subsidiaries has good and, with respect
to real property, valid title to all of the material assets reflected on the
consolidated financial statements of PEC included in the PEC SEC Documents as

thereafter been disposed of in the ordinary course of business consistent with
past practice), subject to no liens, mortgages, pledges, security interests,
encumbrances, claims or charges of any kind (collectively, "Liens") except for

amendment, modification to, or adoption of, any PEC Benefit Plan, in each case,

other than as may be required under Part 6 of Title I of ERISA.

     (f) Except as set forth in Section 2.12 of the PEC Disclosure Schedule,
