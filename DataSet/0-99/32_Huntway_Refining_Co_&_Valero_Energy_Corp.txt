MERGER PROPOSAL -- YOUR VOTE IS VERY IMPORTANT

Dear stockholder:

You are cordially invited to attend a special meeting of stockholders of Huntway
Refining Company to be held at 10:00 a.m. local time
on             ,               , 2001 at our principal executive offices located
at 25129 The Old Road, Suite 322, Newhall, California 91318.

The board of directors of Huntway has unanimously approved an Agreement and Plan
of Merger by and among Huntway, Valero Refining and Marketing Company and HAC
Company, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Valero Refining. The merger agreement
provides for the merger of HAC Company with and into Huntway, with Huntway
continuing as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Valero Refining. In the merger, you
will be entitled to receive $1.90 in cash, without interest, for each of your
shares of Huntway common stock. At the special meeting, you will be asked to
consider and vote upon the approval of the merger agreement and the merger.

The board of directors has determined that the merger agreement and the
transactions contemplated thereby, including the merger, are advisable and in
the best interests of Huntway and its stockholders. The board of directors
unanimously recommends that you vote in favor of the approval of the merger
agreement and the merger.

The accompanying proxy statement explains the proposed merger and provides
information concerning the special meeting. We have also enclosed a copy of our
2000 annual report, which includes our Form 10-K for the year ended
December 31, 2000 and our audited financial statements. Please read these
materials carefully. You may obtain additional information about us from
documents that we have filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

You should be aware that the NYSE has taken action to delist our common stock,
and we encourage you to read the section entitled "SUMMARY TERM SHEET -- Recent
Development" on page 7 of the accompanying proxy statement.

YOUR VOTE IS VERY IMPORTANT. We cannot complete the merger unless holders of at
least a majority of all outstanding shares of Huntway common stock approve of
the merger agreement and the merger. Because approval of the merger agreement
and the merger is based on the affirmative vote of at least a majority of all
shares outstanding rather than of the number of votes cast, failure to vote your
shares will have the same effect as voting against the merger agreement and the
merger. Whether or not you plan to attend the special meeting, we urge you to
vote your shares by signing, dating and promptly returning the enclosed proxy
card to ensure that your shares will be voted at the meeting. Instructions
regarding voting by proxy are contained on the proxy card. If you attend the
meeting and prefer to vote in person, you may do so.

On behalf of the board of directors, we thank you for your continuing support
and urge you to vote FOR approval of the merger agreement and the merger.

                                          Sincerely,

                                          [SIGNATURE OF WARREN J. NELSON]

                                          Warren J. Nelson
                                          PRESIDENT AND CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER

Neither the Securities and Exchange Commission nor any state securities
regulators have approved or disapproved the merger described in the accompanying
proxy statement, nor have they determined if the proxy statement is adequate or
accurate. Furthermore, the Securities and Exchange Commission has not determined
the fairness or merits of the merger. Any representation to the contrary is a
criminal offense.

The accompanying proxy materials are dated                , 2001 and are first
being mailed to our stockholders on or about                , 2001.

                                 Newhall, California 91381

ITEMS OF BUSINESS:               (1) Consider and vote upon a proposal to approve the
                                 Agreement and Plan of Merger dated March 20, 2001, by and
                                 among Huntway Refining Company, Valero Refining and

                                 contemplated by such merger agreement. Valero Energy
                                 Corporation is the parent company of Valero Refining.
                                 The merger agreement provides for, among other things, the
                                 merger of HAC, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Valero Refining,
                                 with and into Huntway, with Huntway continuing as a

                                 each share of Huntway common stock owned by them.

                                 (2) Transact such other business as may properly come before
                                 the special meeting or any adjournment or postponement
                                 thereof.

APPRAISAL RIGHTS:                If you do not vote in favor of the merger agreement and the
                                 merger, you have the right to seek appraisal of the fair
                                 value of your shares if the merger is consummated and you
                                 comply with the Delaware law procedures explained on
                                 pages 38 to 41 of the accompanying proxy statement.

RECORD DATE:                     Only stockholders of record at the close of business
                                 on               , 2001 are entitled to notice of and to
                                 vote at the special meeting or any adjournment or
                                 postponement thereof.

VOTING BY PROXY:                 You may vote in person or by proxy. In order to assure that
                                 your vote will be counted, whether or not you plan to attend
                                 the special meeting, please vote by signing, dating and
                                 returning the enclosed proxy card promptly in the enclosed
                                 prepaid envelope. Instructions regarding voting by proxy are
                                 contained on the proxy card.
                                 Your vote is very important. Because the vote is based on
                                 the number of shares outstanding rather than the number of
                                 votes cast, failure to vote your shares will have the same
                                 effect as voting against the merger agreement and the
                                 merger.

                                          By Order of the Board of Directors,
                                          [SIGNATURE OF EARL G. FLEISHER]

  subsidiary of Valero Refining, formed for the sole purpose of effecting the
  merger.

Please read "THE PARTIES" on page 12.

REPAYMENT AND/OR PURCHASE OF CERTAIN INDEBTEDNESS

- - BANK OF AMERICA. In connection with the merger, Valero Refining will put in
  place a back-up letter of credit with respect to letters of credit outstanding
  under our loan agreement with Bank of America, which will permit the
  termination of such loan agreement subject to certain limited exceptions. We
  have no outstanding indebtedness under the Bank of America loan agreement
  other than letters of credit.

- - BOEING CAPITAL. In connection with the merger, Valero Refining will repay all
  of the outstanding indebtedness under our senior debt facility with Boeing
  Capital Corporation. The indebtedness owed to Boeing Capital will not be
  prepayable at the time of the merger and as a result a prepayment fee will be
  paid to Boeing Capital. The principal amount of indebtedness outstanding as of
  March 31, 2001 under this senior debt facility was $12.3 million and we
  anticipate that the prepayment fee will be approximately $290,000.

- - CONVERTIBLE NOTES. In connection with the merger, Valero Refining will
  purchase all of our outstanding convertible notes for an amount equal to the
  sum of (1) the amount that would have been payable in the merger for the
  common stock underlying such convertible notes had such convertible notes been
  fully converted into shares of common stock immediately prior to the closing
  of the merger and (2) any accrued and unpaid interest on such notes as of the
  closing of the merger. We anticipate that the aggregate purchase price for the
  convertible notes to be paid by Valero Refining (excluding accrued and unpaid
  interest thereon) will be approximately $27.6 million.

- - JUNIOR SUBORDINATED DEBENTURES. In connection with the merger, Valero Refining
  will purchase all of our outstanding junior subordinated debentures for an
  amount equal to the total principal and accrued and unpaid interest thereon as
  of the closing of the merger. The total principal amount of indebtedness under
  the junior subordinated debentures as of March 31, 2001 was $3.7 million.

- - RELEASE OF LIENS. It is contemplated that at the closing all liens related to
  such indebtedness will be terminated and released.

- - CONSENTS. We have not obtained the consent and agreement of Bank of America,
  Boeing Capital Corporation or the holders of the convertible notes or the
  junior subordinated debentures to the repayments and/or purchases described
  above. Such consents and agreements are a closing condition under the merger
  agreement as described below. We have, however, obtained oral assurances that
  such consents and agreements will be given.

Please read "THE MERGER AGREEMENT -- Repayment and/or Purchase of Certain
Indebtedness" beginning on page 28.

REGULATORY APPROVALS

- - No government or other regulatory approvals are required as a prerequisite to
  the merger other than filings pursuant to federal securities laws and the
  filing of the certificate of merger with the Secretary of State of the State
  of Delaware.

Please read "THE MERGER -- Regulatory Requirements" on page 25.

MERGER FINANCING

- - Huntway estimates that approximately $28.5 million will be required to fund
  the payment by Valero Refining of the merger consideration for the common
  stock, assuming no stockholders perfect their appraisal rights under Delaware
  law. In addition, Huntway estimates that an aggregate of approximately
  $6.1 million will be required to be paid with respect to the economic value
  (or spread) on our outstanding options for common stock and an aggregate of
  approximately $43.4 million will be required by Valero Refining for the
  repayments and/or purchases of indebtedness of Huntway contemplated to occur
  upon the merger. The $43.4 million does not include accrued and unpaid
  interest on the indebtedness, but does include the prepayment fee contemplated
  to be paid under the loan agreement with Boeing Capital.

- - Valero Refining expects to have sufficient cash resources available at closing
  to fund all required cash payments. Valero Refining expects to use
  inter-company indebtedness and/or capital contributions from Valero Energy,
  the parent of Valero Refining, to finance the transactions contemplated by the
  merger agreement. Valero Refining does not need, nor does it expect to obtain,
  commitments from lending institutions to specifically finance the cash
  payments by it contemplated pursuant to the merger agreement.

- - Valero Energy has guaranteed all of the obligations and covenants of Valero
  Refining and HAC set forth in the merger agreement, including the payment of
  the merger consideration for the common stock. Valero Energy does not need,
  nor does it expect to obtain, commitments from lending institutions in order
  to provide Valero Refining with financing in connection with the merger.

Please read "THE MERGER -- Financing of the Merger" beginning on page 24.

SURRENDER OF CERTIFICATES

- - Pursuant to the merger agreement, Valero Refining will deposit with a bank or
  trust company an amount of cash necessary to pay the aggregate consideration
  payable to the stockholders of Huntway in the merger. Promptly after the
  effective time of the merger, each stockholder of record will be mailed a
  letter of transmittal and detailed instructions specifying the procedures to
  be followed in surrendering certificates representing common stock. SHARE
  CERTIFICATES SHOULD NOT BE FORWARDED UNTIL RECEIPT OF THE LETTER OF
  TRANSMITTAL.

- - Upon the proper surrender of a share certificate, you will receive a check
  representing an amount of cash equal to $1.90 per share of common stock
  formerly represented by the share certificate surrendered.

TAX CONSEQUENCES AND ACCOUNTING TREATMENT

- - The receipt of cash in the merger by you will be taxable to you for U.S.
  federal income tax purposes in the same way as if you sold your shares in the
  market for $1.90 per share in cash. Assuming you hold your shares as a capital
  asset, you will recognize capital gain or loss on each share as a result of
  the merger equal to the difference, if any, between $1.90 per share and your
  adjusted tax basis in such share.

- - You will need to provide a substitute Form W-9 along with your letter of
  transmittal or a tax withholding will be made from your merger consideration.

- - Because of the complexities of the tax laws, you are advised to consult your
  own tax advisors concerning the applicable federal, state, local, foreign and
  other tax consequences resulting from the merger.

- - The merger will be treated as a "purchase" for accounting purposes.

Please read "THE MERGER -- Material Federal Income Tax Consequences of the
Merger" beginning on page 25 and "THE MERGER -- Accounting Treatment" on
page 24.

RECENT DEVELOPMENT

- - On April 5, 2001, Huntway was notified that the NYSE was taking action to
  delist the common stock from the NYSE. Huntway timely requested a review of
  such determination. We anticipate that the common stock will continue to be
  listed on the NYSE until at least the next scheduled review date, which the
  NYSE indicates is scheduled for         , 2001, as a request for a review
  ordinarily stays delisting until the review is heard. We are considering our
  alternatives if the NYSE does not reverse its determination to delist the
  common stock and if prior to the effective time of any delisting the
  transaction with Valero Refining has not closed.

THE MERGER

BACKGROUND OF THE MERGER

The management and board of directors of Huntway have considered and evaluated
on a periodic basis since at least June 1999 a wide range of strategic
alternatives for Huntway and its businesses with a view toward maximizing value
to its stockholders. To this end, from time to time prior to May 10, 2000,
certain members of the board met or held discussions with investment bankers to
discuss the strategic alternatives available to Huntway.

At the May 10, 2000 regular meeting of the board of directors, Warren
J. Nelson, our President and Chief Executive Officer, as the lead representative
of a group of Huntway officers, indicated that such group intended to make a
proposal to acquire Huntway.

On June 13, 2000, the board of directors formed a special committee consisting
of Brian Hogan, Harris Kaplan and J.C. McFarland (1) to consider strategic
alternatives for Huntway as a means of maximizing stockholder value, including
asset purchases or sales, stock repurchases, public offerings or private
placements of securities, or a sale of Huntway to a third party for cash or
securities and (2) to consider and respond to any proposal that might ultimately
be made by the management group. The special committee elected Mr. McFarland to
serve as its chairman, retained Baker Botts L.L.P. as its legal counsel and,
after considering several proposals from investment banks, engaged Simmons &
Company International to serve as its financial advisor.

From June 13, 2000 to February 21, 2001, the special committee held 18 meetings
(most by telephone) and communicated informally numerous other times.

On September 5, 2000, the special committee met in person with Simmons to review
the initial evaluation by Simmons of various strategic alternatives, including:
(1) maintaining the status quo; (2) increasing the public float by a public
offering of shares; (3) recapitalizing Huntway and paying a special dividend to
stockholders; (4) growing through acquisitions for cash consideration;
(5) growing through acquisitions or mergers for stock consideration; and
(6) selling Huntway to a strategic buyer, financial buyer, management group or
existing large stockholder for cash and/or stock. Simmons concluded that a sale
of Huntway presented the best opportunity to maximize stockholder value and
liquidity.

At the September 5 meeting, the special committee made no decision to pursue a
specific strategic alternative, but requested that Simmons focus on possible
transactions involving a sale of Huntway, and then reviewed with Simmons parties
that might be interested in pursuing such a transaction. The special committee
asked Simmons initially to contact 10 of the most likely interested parties,
including Valero Energy, to determine their interest. The number contacted
eventually was expanded to a total of 20 parties. Huntway subsequently entered
into confidentiality and standstill agreements with the management group and
nine other interested parties and delivered to them a descriptive memorandum
containing information regarding Huntway. Valero Energy signed its
confidentiality agreement on September 27, 2000 and received its memorandum on
October 2, 2000.

On October 27, 2000, the special committee asked each of the interested parties,
including Valero Energy, to submit by November 10, 2000 a written indication of
interest in a possible acquisition of Huntway.

On November 10, 2000, the special committee received non-binding indications of
interest from Valero Energy, the management group and two other interested
parties. The indication of interest of Valero Energy was in the range of $2.45
to $2.50 per share.

On November 13, 2000, the special committee met with Simmons to review the
relative strengths and weaknesses of each of the four indications of interest.
The special committee authorized Simmons to invite each of the four interested
parties, including Valero Energy, to receive a presentation by Huntway
management, visit a data room and conduct due diligence. After all of the
interested parties had visited the data room and received a management
presentation and a proposed form of cash merger agreement, one of the interested
parties indicated that it no longer intended to pursue a transaction with
Huntway.

On January 16, 2001, the special committee through Simmons asked the interested
parties to submit definitive offers by February 13, 2001.

On February 8, 2001, Huntway publicly released its earnings for the year 2000.
The price of the common stock, which had been in the range of $0.63 to $1.06 per
share during the preceding 90 days, rose rapidly to as high as $1.74 per share
and closed at $1.35 per share on February 13.

On February 13, 2001, Valero Energy submitted a cash offer of $1.45 per share
and its comments on the proposed form of cash merger agreement. The special
committee also received a written status update from the management group, and
the remaining interested party requested an extension of time to submit a
proposal, which it subsequently submitted on February 20.

On February 15, 2001, the special committee met with Simmons to review the
Valero Energy offer and as well to discuss the status of the management group
and the interested party that had requested a time extension. The special
committee deferred further action until its scheduled meeting on February 21,
the date of the next regular meeting of the board.

On February 21, 2001, the special committee met in advance of the meeting of the
board of directors. Simmons reviewed and compared the proposals of the
interested parties, and also discussed its analysis of the strategic
alternatives available to Huntway. Simmons advised the special committee of
discussions it had held with Valero Energy since the previous special committee
meeting, including those with respect to the disparity between the Valero Energy
offer and its preliminary indication of interest submitted on November 10, 2000,
and of its evaluation of the potential for negotiating better terms with Valero
Energy. The presentation of Simmons included discussions of (1) the financial
characteristics and prospects of Huntway, (2) the current valuation of Huntway,
(3) the strategic alternatives available to Huntway and the feasibility of each
alternative, (4) the process undertaken by Simmons to solicit proposals by third
parties to acquire Huntway, (5) the proposals received as a result of the
process, (6) contractual issues Simmons had identified in the comments of Valero
Energy on the cash merger agreement proposed by Huntway and (7) possible next
steps. Baker Botts discussed with the special committee the various
recommendations that the special committee could make to the full board of
directors. The special committee concluded that pursuing a sale of Huntway was
the best strategic alternative available. The special committee also concluded
that it was unlikely that an acceptable transaction could be negotiated with the
management group, and thus that the decision as to how to proceed should be made
by the full board.

The full board of directors met immediately following the special committee
meeting on February 21, 2001. All directors attended the meeting in person,
other than Harris Kaplan, who attended the meeting telephonically.
Mr. McFarland, the chairman of the special committee, presented to the board the
report and conclusions of the special committee. Mr. Nelson confirmed that the
management group was not further pursuing a transaction. Mr. McFarland informed
the board of the proposals resulting from the auction process undertaken by the
special committee. Following full discussion by the board of the report and
conclusions of the special committee, Kirkland & Ellis, counsel to Huntway,
advised the board on its legal duties and responsibilities. Simmons then made a
presentation to the board that was similar to the one made at the preceding
special committee meeting. Representatives of Simmons and Kirkland & Ellis
reviewed in particular with the board, and the board discussed in particular,
the proposed terms of the Valero Energy bid. The board discussed with Simmons
among other things the potential synergies that could be realized by Valero
Energy as a result of a purchase of Huntway by Valero Energy and the potential
value of those synergies. After full discussion and due consideration, the board
determined that a transaction with Valero Energy presented the best strategic
alternative for Huntway, provided acceptable terms could be negotiated.

On February 22, 2001, Simmons contacted Valero Energy to request that it
increase its offer to an enterprise value of $80 million or approximately $1.96
per share. Valero Energy indicated that it would take the proposed price under
consideration.

On February 26, 2001 Valero Energy contacted Simmons to inform them that Valero
Energy would not meet the proposed $80 million enterprise value but would be
willing to increase its offer to an enterprise value of $75 million or
approximately $1.82 per share, although this value would require approval by the
executive committee of the Valero Energy board. Later that day, after further
negotiations between Valero Energy and Simmons, Valero Energy ultimately agreed
to an enterprise value of $77.5 million or approximately $1.90 per share.

On February 27, 2001, the Huntway board held a special meeting to review the
proposed transaction and to consider the proposed $1.90 price per share.
Mr. Kaplan, who had acted as the liaison of the board with Simmons since the
February 21 board meeting, reviewed with the board the negotiations that had
occurred between Simmons and Valero Energy since the prior meeting of the board.
Following full discussion by the board and based on the indication of Simmons to
Mr. Kaplan that Simmons would deliver a fairness opinion at the $1.90 proposed
per share price, the board unanimously agreed that a sale of Huntway to Valero
Energy at $1.90 per share should be actively pursued.

The executive committee of the board of Valero Energy met on February 28, 2001
and approved the $1.90 per share price.

Between March 6 and March 20, 2001, representatives of Valero Energy, Huntway,
Simmons and Kirkland & Ellis negotiated the definitive terms of the merger
agreement and various related documents, including in-person negotiations
throughout March 6, March 7 and the morning of March 8, 2001. During this
period, Mr. Nelson made contacts with Bank of America, Boeing Capital, certain
holders of its convertible notes and the holders of its junior subordinated
debentures to discuss the proposed transaction with Valero Energy and to
ascertain whether such parties would support the transaction under its proposed
terms. With respect to Boeing Capital, Mr. Nelson negotiated a prepayment fee of
approximately $290,000. Also in this interim period, Huntway negotiated with
Andre Danesh, as trustee of the Andre Danesh 1997 IRRV Trust, which negotiations
concluded on March 19 and resulted in the Trust entering into an amendment to
the option agreements held by the Trust for cash consideration of $200,000.

On March 16, 2001, the board met to receive an update on the negotiations that
had taken place since the prior board meeting and to consider approval of the
transaction with Valero Energy. Kirkland & Ellis made a detailed presentation
regarding among other things the terms and conditions of the merger agreement
and related documents. Simmons delivered its oral fairness opinion to the board,
which was later confirmed in writing, that as of that date and based upon and
subject to the assumptions, limitations and qualifications set forth in the
opinion, the consideration to be received by Huntway stockholders in the merger
was fair, from a financial point of view, to the Huntway stockholders. Following
extensive discussion and consideration, the board by the unanimous vote of all
directors concluded that the merger agreement and the merger were fair to, and
in the best interests of, the Huntway stockholders and approved the merger
agreement and the merger and certain other matters related thereto, subject to
the favorable resolution of negotiations with Andre Danesh, which as noted above
were resolved on March 19.

On March 20, 2001, following conclusion of the Danesh negotiations, the board
held a telephonic meeting and approved the amendment negotiated with Mr. Danesh
and authorized the execution and delivery of the merger agreement and related
documents. A definitive merger agreement and other documents were executed that
afternoon, and a press release announcing the transaction was issued by Huntway
and Valero Energy after the close of trading that day.

RECOMMENDATION OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS; FAIRNESS OF THE MERGER

At a special meeting of the Board of directors on March 16, 2001, at which all
directors of Huntway were present, the board unanimously concluded that the
terms and provisions of the merger agreement and the merger were fair to and in
the best interests of Huntway and its stockholders and, subject to satisfactory
resolution of issues relating to the Andre Danesh 1997 IRRV Trust

options, approved the merger agreement and recommended that the stockholders
approve the merger agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby.

In reaching its decision to approve and recommend the Valero Refining offer of
$1.90 per share, the board considered a variety of factors, including without
limitation the following, each of which, individually and in the aggregate, in
the opinion of the board, supported such determination:

- -  TERMS OF THE MERGER AGREEMENT. The board considered the financial and other
    terms of the merger agreement. The board also considered the financial
    condition of Valero Energy and the fact that the obligations of Valero
    Refining and HAC under the merger agreement, which are guaranteed by Valero
    Energy, are not subject to any financing condition.

- -  FAIRNESS OPINION OF SIMMONS. The board considered the financial presentation
    of Simmons and its opinion delivered to the board to the effect that, as of
    the date of its opinion and based upon and subject to certain matters stated
    therein, the $1.90 per share cash consideration to be received by Huntway
    stockholders in the merger is fair from a financial point of view. A copy of
    the opinion of Simmons, with a discussion of the information reviewed,
    assumptions made and matters considered by Simmons, is attached to this
    proxy statement as Annex C. You should read this opinion in its entirety as
    well as the other information described under "-- Opinion of Financial
    Advisor" beginning on page 17 below.

- -  MARKET PRICE AND PREMIUM. The board considered:

    -  The fact that the $1.90 per share price offered by Valero Refining
       represented a premium of approximately 17% over the closing price of the
       common stock on March 15, 2001, and approximately 31% over the average
       closing prices of the common stock during the period beginning
       February 9, 2001 (the first trading day following public release of the
       2000 earnings of Huntway) and ending March 15, 2001.

    -  The history of the trading of the common stock on the NYSE during the
       12 months ended February 8, 2001, with the average closing price during
       such period being approximately $1.02 per share of common stock, and the
       premium represented by the merger consideration to the prices reflected
       in such history.

    -  The fact that the closing price of the common stock has not equaled or
       exceeded the merger consideration since June 1, 1998, when Huntway
       converted from partnership to corporate form, other than during three
       brief periods: on one trading day during July 1998, when the closing
       price reached a high of $1.94; on twelve trading days in February and
       March 1999, when the closing price reached a high of $2.13; and on seven
       trading days in September 1999, when the closing price reached a high of
       $2.00.

    -  The fact that the closing price of the common stock has steadily declined
       since June 1, 1998 (other than during the three brief periods described
       above and during the period since February 8, 2001), notwithstanding a
       trend of improved annual earnings since that time.

    -  The volatility in the price of the common stock.

- -  LIQUIDITY OF COMMON STOCK. The board considered the thin trading market and
    the lack of liquidity of the common stock.

- -  NYSE NON-COMPLIANCE. The board considered the fact that the market
    capitalization of Huntway failed to meet the continued listing requirements
    of the NYSE and the unlikelihood that the NYSE would continue the listing of
    the common stock.

- -  POSSIBLE DECLINE IN MARKET PRICE OF COMMON STOCK. The board considered the
    alternatives available to Huntway, and the probability that if Huntway
    remained an independent public corporation, the price that could be received
    by holders of shares of the common stock in the

    open market or in another transaction would be less than the $1.90 per share
    merger consideration.

- -  RESULT OF THE AUCTION PROCESS. The board considered that the auction process
    conducted by Simmons resulted in only two proposals and one indication of
    interest and that at the time the board took final action on the merger only
    one of the foregoing was firm.

- -  NATURE OF THE HUNTWAY BUSINESS. The board considered:

    -  the existing competitive and market positions of Huntway, including the
       nature of the industry in which Huntway operates; and

    -  the dependence of Huntway on hedging for a significant part of its recent
       profits, and the unlikelihood that Huntway will be able to continue to
       obtain hedges on terms as favorable.

- -  AVAILABILITY OF APPRAISAL RIGHTS. The board considered the fact that
    appraisal rights would be available to the holders of common stock under
    Delaware law.

In view of the wide variety of factors considered in connection with its
evaluation of the merger, the board did not find it practicable to, and did not,
quantify or otherwise attempt to assign relative weights to the specific factors
considered in reaching its determination. The determination to approve the
merger was made after consideration of all of the factors as a whole. In
addition, individual members of the board may have given different weights to
different factors.

The board considered the potential drawbacks or risks relating to the merger,
including the following:

- -  The consummation of the merger will preclude stockholders from participating
    in the future growth of Huntway.

- -  The fact that an all-cash transaction would be taxable to Huntway
    stockholders for income tax purposes.

- -  The possibility that, notwithstanding the provisions of the merger agreement
    allowing Huntway under certain circumstances to furnish information to and
    conduct negotiations with a third party, and ultimately terminate the merger
    agreement and enter into an agreement relating to a superior proposal for a
    business combination or acquisition of Huntway, the termination fee payable
    upon such termination might discourage other parties that might have an
    interest in a business combination with, or an acquisition of, Huntway.

In considering the recommendation of the board with respect to the merger
agreement and the merger, stockholders should be aware that the members of the
board are equity and/or option holders in Huntway. The board members believe
that their interests as stockholders in considering the merger agreement and the
merger are substantially the same as the interests of the other stockholders of
Huntway.

OPINION OF FINANCIAL ADVISOR

Simmons has acted as financial adviser to the special committee and the board of
directors of Huntway with respect to evaluating strategic alternatives for
Huntway and developing potential acquirors for Huntway. The board of directors
instructed Simmons, in its role as financial advisor, to evaluate the fairness,
from a financial point of view, of the merger consideration to be received by
the holders of Huntway common stock (the "Public Stockholders") pursuant to the
merger.

On March 16, 2001, Simmons delivered its oral opinion to the board of directors
to the effect that, as of such date and based upon and subject to certain
matters discussed with the board of directors, the merger consideration to be
received by the Public Stockholders pursuant to the transaction in accordance
with the merger agreement was fair to the Public Stockholders from a financial
point of view. Simmons confirmed its opinion in writing (the "Opinion") on
March 20, 2001.

THE FULL TEXT OF THE OPINION, WHICH SETS FORTH THE ASSUMPTIONS MADE, MATTERS
CONSIDERED AND QUALIFICATIONS AND LIMITATIONS ON THE REVIEW UNDERTAKEN, IS
ATTACHED AS ANNEX C TO THIS PROXY STATEMENT AND IS INCORPORATED IN THIS DOCUMENT
BY REFERENCE. THE SUMMARY OF THE OPINION SET FORTH IN THIS PROXY STATEMENT IS
QUALIFIED IN ITS ENTIRETY BY REFERENCE TO THE FULL TEXT OF THE OPINION.
STOCKHOLDERS OF HUNTWAY ARE URGED TO READ THE OPINION IN ITS ENTIRETY. IN
ARRIVING AT ITS OPINION, SIMMONS DID NOT ASCRIBE A SPECIFIC VALUE TO HUNTWAY,
BUT RATHER MADE ITS DETERMINATION AS TO THE FAIRNESS, FROM A FINANCIAL POINT OF
VIEW, OF THE MERGER CONSIDERATION TO BE RECEIVED BY HUNTWAY STOCKHOLDERS IN THE
TRANSACTION ON THE BASIS OF THE FINANCIAL AND COMPARATIVE ANALYSES DESCRIBED
BELOW. SIMMONS' OPINION IS FOR THE USE AND BENEFIT OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS AND
WAS RENDERED TO THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS IN CONNECTION WITH ITS CONSIDERATION OF
THE MERGER. THE OPINION DOES NOT ADDRESS THE MERITS OF THE UNDERLYING DECISION
OF HUNTWAY TO ENGAGE IN THE TRANSACTION CONTEMPLATED BY THE MERGER AGREEMENT.
MOREOVER, IT DOES NOT CONSTITUTE A RECOMMENDATION BY SIMMONS TO ANY STOCKHOLDER
AS TO HOW THE STOCKHOLDERS SHOULD VOTE ON THE MERGER OR THE TRANSACTIONS
CONTEMPLATED BY THE MERGER AGREEMENT.

In connection with its Opinion, Simmons has, among other things: (1) reviewed
the merger agreement and related documents; (2) reviewed certain publicly
available business and financial information relating to Huntway that it deemed
relevant; (3) reviewed certain other information relating to Huntway, including
financial forecasts and operating data prepared by management of Huntway and
provided to Simmons relating to its business, earnings, cash flow, assets,
liabilities and prospects; (4) reviewed certain financial and stock market data
of Huntway and compared that data with similar data for certain other publicly
traded companies that it deemed to be relevant; (5) compared the proposed
financial terms of the transaction contemplated by the merger agreement with the
financial terms of other transactions that it deemed to be relevant;
(6) reviewed the public float and historical daily trading volume of the common
stock of Huntway; and (7) reviewed the results of efforts to solicit indications
of interest and proposals from third parties with respect to an acquisition of
Huntway. In addition, Simmons had discussions with the management of Huntway
concerning the business, operations, assets, financial condition and prospects
of Huntway, and performed such other financial studies and analyses and took
into account such other matters as it deemed necessary, including its assessment
of general economic, market and monetary conditions.

In arriving at its Opinion, Simmons, with the consent of the board of directors,
assumed and relied upon the accuracy and completeness of all the foregoing
information and did not independently verify any of such information. With
respect to such financial forecasts, Simmons utilized certain information set
forth therein and assumed that such information was reasonably prepared on bases
reflecting the best currently available estimates and judgments of the
management of Huntway as to the future financial performance of Huntway. Simmons
did not conduct a physical inspection of any of the assets, operations or
facilities of Huntway and did not make or receive any independent evaluation or
appraisal of any assets or liabilities (contingent or otherwise) of Huntway.
Simmons' Opinion is necessarily based upon market, economic and other conditions
as they existed and could be evaluated on, and the information made available to
it as of, the date of its Opinion.

In preparing its Opinion for the board of directors, Simmons performed a variety
of financial and comparative analyses, including those described below. The
summary of the analyses performed by Simmons, as set forth below, does not
purport to be a complete description of the analyses underlying Simmons'
Opinion. The preparation of a fairness opinion is a complex analytic process
involving various determinations as to the most appropriate and relevant methods
of financial analysis and the application of those methods to the particular
circumstances and, therefore, such an opinion is not readily susceptible to
partial or summary description. No company or transaction

used in such analyses as a comparison is identical to Huntway or the
transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, nor is an evaluation of the
results of such analyses entirely mathematical; rather, it involves complex
considerations and judgments concerning financial and operational
characteristics and other factors that could affect the public trading or other
values of the companies or transactions being analyzed. The estimates contained
in such analyses and the ranges of valuations resulting from any particular
analysis are not necessarily indicative of actual values or predictive of future
results or values, which may be significantly more or less favorable than those
suggested by such analyses. In addition, analyses relating to the value of the
business or securities do not purport to be appraisals or to reflect the prices
at which businesses, companies or securities actually may be sold. Accordingly,
such analyses and estimates are subject inherently to substantial uncertainty.

In arriving at its Opinion, Simmons made qualitative judgments as to the
significance and relevance of each analysis and factor considered by it.
Accordingly, Simmons believes that its analyses must be considered as a whole
and that selecting portions of its analyses and factors, without considering all
analyses and factors, could create an incomplete view of the processes
underlying such analyses and its Opinion. In its analyses, Simmons made numerous
assumptions with respect to general business, economic, market and financial
conditions, as well as other matters, many of which are beyond the control of
Huntway and involve the application of complex methodologies and experienced and
educated judgment.

Valuation Analysis -- Simmons' valuation of Huntway was based upon an assessment
of Huntway as an independent, free standing enterprise without the benefit of
any cost savings or operating synergies that may result from the merger. In
determining its valuation of Huntway, Simmons used the following methodologies:
comparable company trading analysis, comparable transactions analysis and
discounted cash flow analysis. The reference Enterprise Value Range suggested by
each of these methodologies was used to generate a Reference Enterprise Value
Range for Huntway. Enterprise Value was defined to be the total value of the
Company as if it were unencumbered by any convertible or other debt, leases,
minority interests or preferred stock and assumes a normal level of working
capital. The suggested Reference Enterprise Value Range for Huntway was adjusted
for appropriate balance sheet assets and liabilities to arrive at a per share
common equity value range for Huntway (the "Per Share Equity Value Range"). The
Per Share Equity Value Range was then used to evaluate the merger consideration
to be received by the Public Stockholders in the merger. The implied valuation
ranges derived using the various valuation methodologies described above all
supported the conclusion that the merger consideration to be received by the
Public Stockholders in the merger is fair, from a financial point of view, to
such stockholders. The various valuation analyses are summarized below:

(1) COMPARABLE COMPANY TRADING ANALYSIS. Using publicly available information,
Simmons compared selected public market trading multiples for Huntway with
respective corresponding multiples of certain similar publicly traded companies.
Simmons selected a group of companies from the universe of possible companies
based on its views as to the comparability of the financial and operating
characteristics of independent refining companies to Huntway. With respect to
each such analysis, Simmons made such comparisons with the following companies
(the "Comparable Companies"): Crown Central Petroleum Corporation, Frontier Oil
Corporation, Giant Industries, Inc., Holly Corporation, Sunoco, Inc., Tesoro
Petroleum Corporation, Tosco Corporation, Ultramar Diamond Shamrock Corporation,
and Valero Energy Corporation.

Using publicly available information, Simmons calculated and analyzed the common
equity market value multiples of certain historical and projected financial
criteria (such as net income and Leveraged After Tax Cash Flow, defined as net
income plus depreciation plus other non-cash items) and the Enterprise Value
multiples of certain historical and projected financial criteria (such as
earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization ("EBITDA")). The
Enterprise Value of each company was obtained by adding the market value of its
common equity to the sum of the

book value of any debt, preferred stock and minority interest, minus excess
cash. Simmons placed the most emphasis on net income and EBITDA multiples. The
appropriate trailing twelve month ("TTM") and projected year EBITDA multiple
ranges were determined to be 3.0x to 5.0x and 4.0x to 5.0x, respectively. The
appropriate TTM and projected year net income multiple ranges were determined to
be 6.0x to 10.0x and 5.0x to 7.0x, respectively. The appropriate TTM and
projected year Leveraged After Tax Cash Flow multiple ranges were determined to
be 2.0x to 5.0x and 2.5x to 4.5x, respectively. This methodology yielded
valuations that imply an Enterprise Value Range of $50 million to $60 million
for Huntway.

Because of the inherent differences between the businesses, operations,
financial conditions and prospects of Huntway and the businesses, operations,
financial conditions and prospects of the companies included in the Comparable
Companies, Simmons believed that it was inappropriate to, and therefore, did
not, rely solely on the quantitative results of the analysis, and accordingly,
also made qualitative judgements concerning differences between the financial
and operating characteristics of Huntway and companies in the Comparable
Companies group that would affect the public trading values of Huntway and the
Comparable Companies.

(2) COMPARABLE TRANSACTIONS ANALYSIS. Simmons reviewed publicly available
information with respect to selected transactions in which refineries or
independent refining companies were acquired ("Comparable Transactions").
Simmons examined twenty-three such transactions that have occurred since
April 8, 1993.

For each transaction, relevant transaction multiples were analyzed including,
(i) a transaction value, defined as the total value paid for and debt assumed of
the refinery, related facilities and inventories of the refining company
("Transaction Value"), divided by EBITDA, (ii) Transaction Value divided by the
refinery's crude oil processing capacity, as measured by the number of barrels
of crude oil that the refinery can process in a single day ("Capacity") and
(iii) Transaction Value divided by the Capacity times the Nelson Complexity
Factor of the refinery ("Nelson Capacity"). The appropriate TTM, 3-year average,
5-year average and projected EBITDA multiple range was determined to be 3.5x to
5.0x. The appropriate Capacity multiple range was determined to be $1,000 per
barrel to $1,500 per barrel. The appropriate Nelson Capacity multiple range was
determined to be $140 per barrel to $275 per barrel. This methodology yielded
valuations that imply an Enterprise Value Range of $40 million to $55 million
for Huntway.

Because the market conditions, rationale and circumstances surrounding each of
the transactions analyzed were specific to each transaction and because of the
inherent differences between the businesses, operations, financial conditions
and prospects of Huntway and the Comparable Transactions analyzed, Simmons
believed that it was inappropriate to, and therefore did not, rely solely on the
quantitative results of the analysis, and accordingly, also made qualitative
judgments concerning differences between the characteristics of Huntway and the
assets and companies included in the Comparable Transactions that would affect
the acquisition values of Huntway and such Comparable Transactions.

(3) DISCOUNTED CASH FLOW ANALYSIS. Simmons prepared an after-tax unlevered free
cash flow model for Huntway utilizing information and projections provided by
Huntway. Simmons used discount rates of 10% to 14% and terminal EBITDA multiples
of 3.5x to 5.0x. The discount rates and terminal EBITDA multiples were based on
Simmons' review of the financial terms of similar transactions in the refining
sector. The unlevered after tax free cash flows and the terminal values were
discounted to present values. This methodology yielded valuations that imply an
Enterprise Value Range of $50 million to $60 million for Huntway.

(4) VALUATION CONCLUSION. Considering each of the foregoing analyses, among
other things, Simmons concluded that a relevant suggested Reference Enterprise
Value Range for Huntway was $50 million to $60 million. This Reference
Enterprise Value Range of Huntway was based on an assessment of the company as
an independent, free-standing enterprise without the benefit of any

cost savings or operating synergies that may result from the merger. Adjusting
this range by an aggregate $30.5 million on the low end and an aggregate
$6.8 million on the high end for excess cash, stock options proceeds,
convertible debt and other debt, and using 18.887 million shares outstanding on
the low end and 34.725 million shares outstanding on the high end, implied a Per
Share Equity Value Range of $1.04 per share to $1.53 per share.

PREMIUM ANALYSES.  In order to determine the magnitude of the premium implicit
in the merger consideration, Simmons compared the merger consideration to
different Huntway per share common stock prices or average prices, including:
(i) the closing sales price of Huntway common stock on the NYSE on March 19,
2001(the "March 19 Closing Price") of $1.69 per share; (ii) the closing sales
price of Huntway common stock price prior to the announcement of fourth quarter,
2000 earnings on February 8, 2001 (the "February 8 Closing Price") of $1.03 per
share; and (iii) the average of the closing sales prices of Huntway common stock
for the 30 trading days ending on March 19, 2001 prior to the announcement of
the Merger (the "Pre-Announcement Date Average Trading Price") of $1.41 per
share. Simmons found that the merger consideration represented a premium of
12.4% over the March 19 Closing Price, 84.5% over the February 8 Closing Price
and 34.8% over the Pre-announcement Date Average Trading Price.

Simmons is an internationally recognized investment-banking firm specializing in
the energy industry and, as part of its investment banking business, is
regularly engaged in the valuation of businesses and securities in connection
with mergers and acquisitions. The special committee selected Simmons as its
financial adviser because of Simmons' experience and expertise. In the ordinary
course of its business, Simmons may trade in the debt and equity securities of
Huntway and Valero Energy (and may, after the completion of the merger, trade in
the debt and equity securities of Valero Energy) for its own account and for the
accounts of its customers and, accordingly, may at any time hold a long or short
position in such securities.

Pursuant to the terms of the engagement of Simmons, Huntway has paid or has
agreed to pay Simmons for its financial advisory services in connection with the
transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement: (i) an aggregate of $625,000
through and including the date of mailing of this proxy statement; and (ii) an
additional fee of approximately $530,000 upon the merger closing. In addition,
Huntway has agreed to reimburse Simmons for its reasonable out-of-pocket
expenses, including the fees and expenses of its legal counsel, incurred in
connection with the engagement and to indemnify Simmons against certain
liabilities or to contribute to payments Simmons may be required to make in
respect thereof.

CERTAIN EFFECTS OF THE MERGER

If the merger is consummated, Huntway will become a wholly-owned subsidiary of
Valero Refining and you will no longer have any interest in, and will not be a
stockholder of, Huntway. Therefore, you will not benefit from any future
earnings or growth of Huntway or benefit from any increase in the value of
Huntway, but you will also no longer bear the risk of any decrease in value of
Huntway. Instead, you will have the right to receive upon consummation of the
merger $1.90 in cash for each of your shares of common stock. The benefit to the
holders of common stock of the transaction is the payment of a premium, in cash,
above the market value for such stock prior to the announcement of the merger
agreement. This cash payment assures that all stockholders will receive the same
amount for their shares. The detriment of the merger to such holders is their
inability to participate as continuing stockholders in the possible future
growth of Huntway.

Immediately prior to the effective time of the merger, each outstanding employee
and director option to purchase shares of common stock will become fully vested
and exercisable. In addition, each such option shall upon the merger be deemed
to constitute an option to acquire, on the same terms and conditions (subject to
certain exceptions) as were applicable under such option immediately prior to
the merger, the same merger consideration as the holder of such option would
have been entitled to receive pursuant to the merger agreement had such holder
exercised such

option in full immediately prior to the merger. At the closing of the merger,
Valero Refining will pay to each holder of such outstanding options who has
previously delivered certain written instructions to Huntway, an amount equal to
the difference between $1.90 and the exercise price of the applicable option,
multiplied by the number of shares subject to the option, less any amounts
required to be withheld or deducted.

Each option held by the Andre Danesh 1997 IRRV Trust shall upon the merger be
deemed to constitute an option to acquire, on the same terms and conditions
(subject to certain exceptions) as were applicable under such option immediately
prior to the merger, the same merger consideration as the holder of such option
would have been entitled to receive pursuant to the merger agreement had such
holder exercised such option in full immediately prior to the merger.

As a result of the merger, Huntway will be a privately held corporation, and
there will be no public market for its common stock, which stock is currently
registered under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. After the merger, the
common stock will be delisted from the New York Stock Exchange, the registration
of the common stock under the Exchange Act will be terminated, Huntway will be
relieved of the obligation to comply with the proxy rules of Regulation 14A
under Section 14 of the Exchange Act and its officers, directors and beneficial
owners of more than 10 percent of the common stock, subject to certain
limitations, will be relieved of the reporting requirements and "short-swing"
trading provisions under Section 16 of the Exchange Act. Further, Huntway will
no longer be subject to the periodic reporting requirements of the Exchange Act
and will cease filing information with the SEC.

The officers and directors of HAC will become the officers and directors of
Huntway immediately after the merger. The certificate of incorporation of
Huntway will be amended to read in its entirety as the certificate of
incorporation of HAC and the bylaws of Huntway will be amended to read in their
entirety as the bylaws of HAC.

CONDUCT OF THE BUSINESS OF HUNTWAY IF THE MERGER IS NOT CONSUMMATED

If the merger is not consummated, we expect to continue to operate our business
substantially as presently operated. We would, however, encourage you to read
"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations" included in our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2000 which
is incorporated into this proxy statement by reference.

CONFLICTS OF INTEREST OF CERTAIN PERSONS IN THE MERGER; CERTAIN RELATIONSHIPS

You should be aware that the executive officers and directors of Huntway have
interests in the merger that are different from, or in addition to, their
interests as stockholders of Huntway generally. The Huntway board was aware of
these interests and considered them, among other matters, in approving the
merger and the merger agreement.

COMMON STOCK.  As of March 31, 2001, the executive officers and directors of
Huntway beneficially owned an aggregate of 1,315,933 shares, or 9%, of
outstanding common stock, which will be treated in the merger in the same manner
as shares of common stock held by other stockholders.

STOCK OPTIONS.  Pursuant to the terms of the merger agreement, all options,
whether or not vested or exercisable, granted under the Huntway 1996 Employee
Incentive Option Plan and the Huntway 1998 Stock Incentive Plan to employees,
executive officers and directors will become fully vested and exercisable at the
effective time of the merger. In addition, Huntway has made an arrangement with
Valero Refining that will permit the economic value (or spread) of such options
to be paid at the closing of the merger in cash.

The following table shows the number of Huntway options held by Huntway
executive officers and directors whose vesting and exercisability will
accelerate as a result of the merger, the number of already vested and
exercisable options and the estimated value of all Huntway stock options held by
such persons.

CONVERTIBLE NOTES.  Lighthouse Investors, LLC currently holds $11 million
aggregate principal amount of our outstanding convertible notes. Richard
Spencer, a director of Huntway, is an affiliate of Lighthouse Investors, LLC and
has indirect pecuniary interests in such entity. As discussed in more detail on
page 29, Valero Refining has agreed to purchase all outstanding convertible
notes of Huntway, including the convertible notes held by Lighthouse Investors,
LLC.

NELSON EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENT.  Mr. Nelson, our President and Chief Executive
Officer, has an employment agreement with Huntway that expires in March 2003,
but may be extended for additional one year terms prior to his sixty-fifth
birthday. The agreement provides that in the event of

a "change of control," if Mr. Nelson is involuntarily terminated without "cause"
or terminates his employment for "good reason" within twelve months following
such change in control, Mr. Nelson is entitled to among other things (1) a lump
sum payment equal to three times his then current base salary and target
performance bonus and (2) to the continuation of certain health and other
benefits for a period of three years following the then current term of his
employment agreement, subject to certain limitations. The proposed merger will
constitute a "change of control" under this employment agreement. Valero
Refining has not indicated it will continue the employment of Mr. Nelson after
the merger, other than for a brief transition period. In such event, the
aggregate lump sum payable to Mr. Nelson (before required tax withholdings)
would be approximately $844,000.

CHANGE IN CONTROL POLICY.  We currently have a change in control policy for our
executive officers and certain key employees, including without limitation
Messrs. Fleisher, Stringer, Nawrocki and Darnell. In the event of a "change of
control," if a participating employee is involuntarily terminated without
"cause" or terminates his employment for "good reason" within twelve months
following such change in control, such employee is entitled to receive (1) a
lump sum payment equal to the current annual salary and target bonus of such
employee and (2) the continuation of certain health and other benefits for a
period of twelve months following termination. The proposed merger would
constitute a "change in control" under this policy. If the employment of all
four executive officers of Huntway who are subject to this policy were to be
involuntarily terminated without cause immediately after the effective time of
the merger, the aggregate lump sum payable to them upon the terminations (before
required tax withholdings) would be approximately $907,000.

INDEMNIFICATION; DIRECTORS AND OFFICER INSURANCE.  Please refer to "THE MERGER
AGREEMENT -- Covenants -- Indemnification and Insurance of Huntway Directors and
Officers" for a discussion of indemnification and insurance rights of our
directors and officers following the merger.

EMPLOYEE BENEFITS.  Please refer to "THE MERGER AGREEMENT -- Covenants --
Employee Matters" for a discussion of the employee benefits to be provided to
our employees, including any executive officers, who remain employed by Huntway
following the merger.

ACCOUNTING TREATMENT

The merger will be accounted for under the purchase method of accounting. Under
this method of accounting, the purchase price will be allocated to assets
acquired and liabilities assumed based on the estimated fair values at the
effective time of the merger (with the excess purchase price after such
allocation being recorded as goodwill).

FINANCING OF THE MERGER

Huntway estimates that approximately $28.5 million will be required to fund the
payment by Valero Refining of the merger consideration for the common stock,
assuming no stockholders perfect their appraisal rights under Delaware law. In
addition, Huntway estimates that an aggregate of approximately $6.1 million will
be required to be paid with respect to the economic value (or spread) on our
outstanding options for common stock and an aggregate of approximately
$43.4 million will be required by Valero Refining for the repayments and/or
purchases of indebtedness of Huntway contemplated to occur upon the merger. The
$43.4 million does not include accrued and unpaid interest on the indebtedness,
but does include the prepayment fee contemplated to be paid under the loan
agreement with Boeing Capital.

Valero Refining expects to have sufficient cash resources available at closing
to fund all required cash payments. Valero Refining expects to use inter-company
indebtedness and/or capital

contributions from Valero Energy, the parent of Valero Refining, to finance the
transactions contemplated by the merger agreement. Valero Refining does not
need, nor does it expect to obtain, commitments from lending institutions to
specifically finance the cash payments by it contemplated pursuant to the merger
agreement.

Valero Energy has guaranteed all of the obligations and covenants of Valero
Refining and HAC set forth in the merger agreement, including the payment of the
merger consideration for the common stock. Valero Energy does not need, nor does
it expect to obtain, commitments from lending institutions in order to provide
Valero Refining with financing in connection with the merger.

REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS

Other than approvals, filings or notices required pursuant to federal securities
law and the filing of the certificate of merger with the Secretary of State of
the State of Delaware, no other government or regulatory approvals, filings or
notices are required in connection with the merger. However, at any time before
or after the merger, the Department of Justice or the Federal Trade Commission
could take action under the antitrust laws as it deems necessary or desirable in
the public interest, including seeking to enjoin the merger or seeking
divestiture of substantial assets of Huntway and Valero Refining or their
subsidiaries. Private parties and state attorneys general may also bring an
action under the antitrust laws under certain circumstances. There can be no
assurance that a challenge to the merger on antitrust grounds will not be made
or, if such a challenge is made, of the result.

MATERIAL FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSEQUENCES OF THE MERGER

GENERAL.  The following is a summary of the material United States federal
income tax consequences of the merger to Huntway stockholders. This summary is
based upon the provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended,
applicable current and proposed United States Treasury Regulations, judicial
authority, and administrative rulings and practice. Legislative, judicial or
administrative rules and interpretations are subject to change, possibly on a
retroactive basis, at any time, and, therefore, the following statements and
conclusions could be altered or modified. This summary only applies to shares of
Huntway common stock held as capital assets by a United States person (I.E., a
citizen or resident of the United States or a domestic corporation), and it does
not address all aspects of United States federal income taxation that may be
relevant to a particular Huntway stockholder in light of that Huntway
stockholder's personal investment circumstances, or to Huntway stockholders
subject to special treatment under the United States federal income tax laws
(for example, life insurance companies, tax-exempt organizations, financial
institutions, United States expatriates, foreign corporations and nonresident
alien individuals), Huntway stockholders who hold shares of Huntway common stock
as part of a hedging, "straddle," conversion or other integrated transaction, or
Huntway stockholders who acquired their shares of Huntway common stock through
the exercise of director or employee stock options or other compensation
arrangements. In addition, the discussion does not address any aspect of
foreign, state or local taxation or estate and gift taxation that may be
applicable to a Huntway stockholder.

CONSEQUENCES OF THE MERGER TO HUNTWAY STOCKHOLDERS.  The receipt of the merger
consideration in the merger will be a taxable transaction for United States
federal income tax purposes (and also may be a taxable transaction under
applicable state, local and other income tax laws). In general, for United
States federal income tax purposes, a holder of Huntway common stock will
recognize gain or loss equal to the difference between such stockholder's
adjusted tax basis in Huntway's common stock converted in the merger, and the
amount of cash received. Gain or loss will be calculated separately for each
block of shares converted in the merger (I.E., shares acquired at the same cost
in a single transaction). The gain or loss will be capital gain or loss, and
will be short-term gain or loss if, at the effective time of the merger, the
shares of Huntway common stock

so converted were held for one year or less. If the shares were held for more
than one year, the gain or loss will be long-term, subject (in the case of
stockholders who are individuals) to tax at a maximum United States federal
income tax rate of 20%.

BACKUP TAX WITHHOLDING.  Under the United States federal income tax backup
withholding rules, unless an exemption applies, Valero Refining is generally
required to and will withhold 31% of all payments to which a Huntway stockholder
or other payee is entitled in the merger, unless the Huntway stockholder or
other payee provides a tax identification number (social security number in the
case of an individual, or employer identification number in the case of other
stockholders), and certifies under penalties of perjury that that number is
correct. Each Huntway stockholder and, if applicable, each other payee, should
complete and sign the substitute Form W-9 that will be a part of the letter of
transmittal to be returned to the exchange agent (or its agent) in order to
provide the information and certification necessary to avoid backup withholding,
unless an applicable exemption exists and is otherwise proved in a manner
satisfactory to the exchange agent (or its agent). The exemptions provide that
certain Huntway stockholders (including, among others, all corporations and
certain foreign individuals) are not subject to these backup withholding
requirements. In order for a foreign individual to qualify as an exempt
recipient, however, he or she must submit a signed statement (such as a

MERGER, INCLUDING THE APPLICATION AND EFFECT OF STATE, LOCAL AND OTHER TAX LAWS.

THE MERGER AGREEMENT

The following is a summary of the material provisions of the merger agreement, a
copy of which is attached to this proxy statement as Annex A. This summary is
qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the merger agreement.

COMPLETION OF THE MERGER

The merger agreement provides that the merger will become effective at such time
as a certificate of merger is duly filed with the Secretary of State of the
State of Delaware or at such later time as is agreed to by the parties and as is
specified in the certificate of merger. If the merger is approved at the special
meeting by the requisite stockholder vote, it is currently anticipated that the
merger will become effective as soon as practicable after the special meeting,
subject to satisfaction or waiver of the closing conditions in the merger
agreement other than stockholder approval; however, there can be no assurance as
to the timing of the consummation of the merger or that the merger will be
consummated.

MERGER CONSIDERATION

At the effective time of the merger, HAC will be merged with and into Huntway,
the separate corporate existence of HAC will cease and Huntway will continue as
a wholly-owned subsidiary of Valero Refining. In the merger, each share of
common stock (other than common stock held (1) in the treasury of Huntway,
(2) by stockholders who perfect appraisal rights or (3) if any, by Valero
Refining or HAC) will, by virtue of the merger and without any action on the
part of the holder thereof, be converted into the right to receive $1.90 per
share in cash, without interest. Each certificate representing shares of Huntway
common stock that have been converted under the terms of the merger agreement
will, after the effective time of the merger, evidence only the right to
receive, upon the surrender of such certificate, an amount of cash per share
equal to the merger consideration.

Each share of common stock owned by Valero Refining or HAC, if any, or held in
the treasury of Huntway will automatically be canceled and retired and no
payment will be made with respect thereto.

Stockholders who do not vote to approve the merger agreement and who otherwise
comply with the provisions of the Delaware General Corporation Law regarding
statutory appraisal rights have the right to seek a determination of the fair
value of their shares of Huntway common stock and payment in cash therefor in
lieu of the merger consideration. See "RIGHT OF APPRAISAL" beginning on page 38
below.

THE EXCHANGE FUND; PAYMENT FOR SHARES OF HUNTWAY COMMON STOCK

Before the special meeting, Valero Refining will enter into an agreement with a
bank or trust company (the "exchange agent") selected by Valero Refining and
acceptable to Huntway, for the purpose of exchanging the common stock for the
merger consideration. At the effective time of the merger, Valero Refining will
cause to be deposited with the exchange agent, for the benefit of holders of
common stock that is converted into the merger consideration, an amount in cash
equal to the aggregate merger consideration (the "exchange fund").

As soon as practicable after the effective time of the merger, but in any event
within five business days thereafter, Valero Refining or the exchange agent will
mail to each record holder of shares of Huntway common stock immediately prior
to the effective time of the merger a letter of transmittal and instructions for
surrendering certificates formerly representing shares of common stock. No
stockholder should surrender any certificates until the stockholder receives the
letter of transmittal

and other materials for such surrender. Upon surrender of a certificate for
cancellation to the exchange agent, together with a letter of transmittal, duly
executed and completed, and such other customary documents as may be required
pursuant to the instructions, the holder of such certificate will be entitled to
receive in exchange therefor the merger consideration for each share of Huntway
common stock formerly represented by such certificate, without any interest
thereon, less any required withholding of taxes, and the certificate so
surrendered will be canceled. The merger consideration will be delivered by the
exchange agent as promptly as practicable following surrender of a certificate
and delivery of a duly executed and completed letter of transmittal and any
other required documents. Cash payments may be made by check unless otherwise
required by a depositary institution in connection with the book-entry delivery
of securities.

If payment of the merger consideration is to be made to a person other than the
person in whose name the certificate surrendered is registered, it will be a
condition of payment that the certificate so surrendered be properly endorsed
(together with signature guarantees on such certificate and any related stock
power) or otherwise be in proper form for transfer and that the exchange agent
receives evidence that any applicable transfer or other taxes have been paid or
are not applicable.

YOU SHOULD NOT SEND YOUR CERTIFICATES NOW AND SHOULD SEND THEM ONLY PURSUANT TO
INSTRUCTIONS SET FORTH IN THE LETTER OF TRANSMITTAL WHICH WILL BE MAILED TO
STOCKHOLDERS AS SOON AS PRACTICABLE AFTER THE EFFECTIVE TIME OF THE MERGER. IN
ALL CASES, THE MERGER CONSIDERATION WILL BE PAID ONLY IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE
PROCEDURES SET FORTH IN THIS PROXY STATEMENT AND THE LETTER OF TRANSMITTAL.

One year following the effective time of the merger, the exchange agent may
return to Valero Refining any portion of the exchange fund that remains
undistributed to the holders of Huntway common stock (including the proceeds of
any investments thereof), and any holders of Huntway common stock who have not
theretofore complied with the above-described procedures to receive payment of
the merger consideration may look only to Valero Refining for payment.

TRANSFERS OF HUNTWAY COMMON STOCK

At the effective time of the merger, the stock transfer books of Huntway will be
closed, and there will be no further registration of transfers of shares of
Huntway common stock thereafter on the records of Huntway.

TREATMENT OF OPTIONS

Immediately prior to the effective time of the merger, each outstanding employee
and director option to purchase shares of common stock will become fully vested
and exercisable. In addition, each such option shall upon the merger be deemed
to constitute an option to acquire, on the same terms and conditions (subject to
certain exceptions) as were applicable under such option immediately prior to
the merger, the same merger consideration as the holder of such option would
have been entitled to receive pursuant to the merger agreement had such holder
exercised such option in full immediately prior to the merger. At the closing of
the merger, Valero Refining will pay to each holder of such outstanding option
who has previously delivered certain written instructions to Huntway, an amount
equal to the difference between $1.90 and the exercise price of the applicable
option, multiplied by the number of shares subject to the option, less any
amounts required to be withheld or deducted.

REPAYMENT AND/OR PURCHASE OF CERTAIN INDEBTEDNESS

BANK OF AMERICA LOAN AGREEMENT.  Valero Refining has agreed to put in place a
back-up letter of credit from a financial institution acceptable to Bank of
America with respect to letters of credit outstanding under our loan agreement
with Bank of America upon consummation of the merger.

Huntway and Valero Refining have agreed to use their reasonable best efforts to
cause Bank of America to enter into an agreement with Huntway that provides for
(1) Bank of America to take all actions necessary and appropriate to cause the
release and termination of all liens with respect to such loan agreement and to
join in the termination of certain collateral documents at the closing, (2) the
termination of such loan agreement and (3) Bank of America to join in all
actions necessary and appropriate to cause the termination of an intercreditor
agreement and certain collateral documents upon the closing. As of March 31,
2001, Huntway has no outstanding indebtedness under the loan agreement, other
than letters of credit.

BOEING CAPITAL LOAN AGREEMENT.  Huntway and Valero Refining have agreed to use
their reasonable best efforts to cause Boeing Capital Corporation to enter into
an agreement with Huntway (1) that permits the payment by Valero Refining at the
closing of all indebtedness and other amounts then outstanding or payable under
such loan agreement and (2) that provides, subject to the payment at the closing
of all indebtedness and other amounts then outstanding or payable under such
loan agreement, for (a) Boeing Capital to take all actions necessary and
appropriate to cause the release and termination of all liens with respect to
such loan agreement and to join in the termination of certain collateral
documents at the closing, (b) the termination of such loan agreement and the
surrender for cancellation of the notes issued thereunder upon the closing and
(c) Boeing Capital to join in all actions necessary and appropriate to cause the
termination of an intercreditor agreement and certain collateral documents upon
the closing. Valero Refining has also agreed to pay Boeing Capital a certain
prepayment fee related to the loan agreement. The principal amount of
indebtedness outstanding as of March 31, 2001 under the loan agreement was
$12.3 million and we anticipate that the prepayment fee will be approximately
$290,000.

CONVERTIBLE NOTES.  Huntway and Valero Refining have agreed to use their
reasonable best efforts to cause each holder of a convertible note to enter into
an agreement with Huntway (1) that permits Valero Refining to purchase such
convertible note at or immediately prior to the closing for cash in an amount
equal to the sum of (a) the amount that would have been payable in the merger
for the common stock underlying such convertible note had such convertible note
been fully converted into shares of common stock immediately prior to the
closing and (b) any accrued and unpaid interest on such convertible note as of
the closing, but not including any prepayment premium or penalty, and (2) that
provides, subject to such payment at the closing, for among other things
(a) the termination of the indenture for the convertible notes and a related
agreement, (b) the due transfer of the underlying convertible note to Valero
Refining upon the closing, (c) the release and termination of all liens related
to the convertible notes and to join in the termination of certain collateral
documents at the closing and (d) holders of convertible notes to join in all
actions necessary and appropriate to cause the termination of an intercreditor
agreement and certain collateral documents at the closing. We anticipate that
the aggregate purchase price for the convertible notes to be paid by Valero
Refining (excluding accrued and unpaid interest thereon) will be approximately
$27.6 million.

JUNIOR SUBORDINATED DEBENTURES.  Huntway and Valero Refining have agreed to use
their reasonable best efforts to cause each holder of a junior subordinated
debenture to enter into an agreement with Huntway (1) that permits Valero
Refining to purchase such junior subordinated debenture at or immediately prior
to the closing for cash in an amount equal to the total principal and accrued
and unpaid interest thereon as of the closing, but not including any prepayment
penalty or premium, and (2) that provides, subject to such payment at the
closing, for among other things the due transfer of the underlying junior
subordinated debenture to Valero Refining upon the closing. The total principal
amount of indebtedness under the junior subordinated debentures as of March 31,
2001 was $3.7 million.

RELEASE OF LIENS.  It is contemplated that at the closing all liens related to
such indebtedness will be terminated and released.

CONSENTS.  Huntway has not obtained the consent and agreement of Bank of
America, Boeing Capital or the holders of the convertible notes or the junior
subordinated debentures to the repayments and/or purchases described above. Such
consents and agreements are a closing condition under the merger agreement as
described below. We have, however, obtained oral assurances that such consents
and agreements will be given.

INDEMNIFICATION AND INSURANCE FOR HUNTWAY DIRECTORS AND OFFICERS.  Valero
Refining and Huntway have agreed for six years after the merger:

- -  to indemnify our present and former officers and directors in respect of
    actions taken or failures to take action prior to and including the
    consummation of the merger, to the fullest extent permitted by law;

- -  to maintain officer and director liability insurance and excess liability
    insurance covering those directors and officers currently covered by our
    liability insurance policies with respect to actions taken or failures to
    take action prior to and including the consummation of the merger, on terms
    and conditions no less favorable than those in effect on the date of the
    merger agreement under our existing policies; and

- -  to perform the indemnification agreements entered into in August 2000 with
    the members of the special committee of our board of directors.

EMPLOYEE MATTERS.  In connection with the merger, Valero Refining has agreed to
honor and perform, and to cause Huntway to honor and perform, our written
severance, change of control and termination programs, policies, agreements and
plans, including without limitation the employment agreement of Warren J. Nelson
and our change of control policy for executive officers and certain key
employees.

For a period of one year after the merger, Valero Refining has agreed to provide
continuing employees of Huntway with compensation and benefits that are no less
favorable in the aggregate than those currently provided by us to such
employees; provided that the defined benefit pension plan of Valero Refining
will be deemed a comparable substitute for our Money Purchase Pension Plan.
Valero Refining will recognize service with us and any predecessor entities for
all purposes

(including, without limitation, for vesting, eligibility to participate,
severance and benefit accrual); provided that, with respect to our Money
Purchase Pension Plan, benefits under such plan shall be frozen as of the
effective time of the merger and, with respect to the defined benefit pension
plan of Valero Refining, past service with us shall count for vesting purposes
only and benefits under such plan will begin to accrue as of the effective time
of the merger only. Vesting schedules under our employee plans, including the
Profit Sharing and Tax Deferred Savings Plan (401(k) Plan) and the Money
Purchase Pension Plan, will not be accelerated or otherwise affected by the
transactions contemplated by the merger agreement and amounts held by our
employees in our 401(k) Plan and Money Purchase Pension Plan that are unvested
as of the effective time will vest in accordance with the vesting schedule
provided under such plans. With respect to welfare benefit plans, Valero
Refining has also agreed to, and to cause Huntway to, waive all limitations as
to preexisting conditions and all waiting or elimination periods and service
requirements applicable to employees of Huntway, except to the extent
preexisting conditions limitations, waiting or elimination periods or service
requirements were in effect immediately prior to the effective time of the
merger with respect to such employees under comparable employee welfare benefit
plans maintained by our company immediately prior to the effective time of the
merger.

Valero Refining has agreed to pay a retention bonus and severance payment to our
eligible employees who will not have employment with Huntway following the
closing of the merger and who are not otherwise entitled to a change in control
payment pursuant to our existing policies. The retention bonus is equal to
25 percent of the base salary of such employee and the severance payment is
equal to one month of the base salary of such employee for the first year (or
partial year) of service with us plus one week of the base salary of such
employee for each additional year (or partial year) of consecutive service with
us. Payment of the retention bonus and severance payment will be made in cash in
a lump sum at the later of the closing of the merger or the last date of service
with Huntway after closing, provided that such payment must be made on or before
60 days after the closing, subject to a limited exception.

NO SOLICITATION OF ACQUISITION PROPOSALS.  We have agreed that we will not, nor
will we authorize or knowingly permit our directors, officers, employees,
investment bankers, attorneys, accountants, agents or other advisors or
representatives to, directly or indirectly:

- -  solicit, initiate or knowingly facilitate or encourage any offer or proposal
    for or indication of interest in a merger, consolidation, stock exchange,
    business combination, reorganization, recapitalization, liquidation,
    dissolution or other similar transaction or any purchase of a majority or
    more of our assets or a majority or more of our common stock or the
    ownership interest in our subsidiary (an "acquisition proposal");

- -  participate in any discussions or negotiations regarding, or furnish to
    anyone any information with respect to, or take any other action knowingly
    to facilitate any inquiries or the making of any proposal that constitutes,
    or reasonably could be expected to lead to, any acquisition proposal;

- -  grant any waiver or release under any standstill or similar agreement with
    respect to any class of our equity securities; or

- -  enter into any agreement with respect to an acquisition proposal.

The foregoing notwithstanding, Huntway may take any action described above in
respect of any person, but only if such person delivers an acquisition proposal
that, in the good faith judgment of our board of directors, either is a superior
proposal or could reasonably be expected to lead to the delivery of a superior
proposal within 75 days of delivery of such acquisition proposal or if otherwise
required in order to satisfy the fiduciary duties of our board of directors as
such duties would exist under applicable law in the absence of the restrictions
set forth above. In addition, prior

to our taking such action in respect of such person, such person must enter into
a confidentiality agreement with us in form and substance substantially similar
to the confidentiality agreement entered into by Valero Energy and Huntway.

Huntway has agreed to not enter into any binding agreement (other than such a
confidentiality agreement) with respect to any such acquisition proposal without
first paying a $1.75 million termination fee and terminating the merger
agreement.

If prior to the termination of the merger agreement in accordance with its terms
Huntway receives an inquiry or proposal from any person relating to an
acquisition proposal, Huntway must advise Valero Refining of the receipt of such
inquiry or proposal (and any change or modification thereto) promptly upon such
receipt. Huntway must also advise Valero Refining of the material terms and
conditions of such inquiry or proposal and any subsequent change or modification
thereto, but Huntway is not required to disclose the identity or source of such
inquiry or proposal or any agent or representative acting on behalf of such
person.

TITLE POLICIES.  The cost of a certain title policy, title report and survey
with respect to our Benicia, California facility will be promptly paid when due
by Valero Refining or, if paid by our company, promptly reimbursed by Valero
Refining upon our request.

    to such failure or breach cannot be satisfied, and such breach or failure is
    incapable of being satisfied by July 31, 2001, or

(6) our board has authorized us to enter into a definitive agreement with
    respect to a superior proposal, subject to payment of the termination fee
    described in the next section below.

If the merger agreement is validly terminated, it will become void and have no
effect, without any liability of any party (or any stockholder, director,
officer, employee, agent, consultant or representative of that party) to the
other party. However, certain provisions thereof relating to among other things
the termination fee described in the next section below will continue in effect.

TERMINATION FEE

All costs and expenses incurred in connection with the merger agreement and
related transactions will be paid by the party incurring such costs or expenses,
subject to certain exceptions. Huntway, however, has agreed to pay Valero
Refining a $1.75 million termination fee if:

- -  Huntway terminates the merger agreement for the reason described in
    paragraph (6) of the immediately preceding section;

- -  Huntway terminates the merger agreement for the reason described in
    paragraph (3) of the immediately preceding section and within 180 days of
    such termination we consummate an acquisition proposal with another person;

- -  Valero Refining terminates the merger agreement for the reason described in
    paragraph (3) of the immediately preceding section and within 180 days of
    such termination we consummate an acquisition proposal with another person;
    or

- -  Huntway or Valero Refining terminates the merger agreement for the reason
    described in paragraph (3) of the immediately preceding section and (a) one
    or more of our directors or certain of our officers has failed to vote any
    of his or her directly-owned (that is, not taking into account common stock
    beneficially owned as a result of among other things any such insider acting
    in a fiduciary or representative capacity) shares of common stock
    outstanding on the record date for the stockholder meeting in favor of
    approval of the merger agreement and the merger, (b) stockholder approval
    would have been obtained but for such failure and (c) the merger agreement
    is not terminable by Huntway as contemplated by paragraph (5) of the
    immediately preceding section.

Any termination fee payable by Huntway must be paid to Valero Refining prior to
or concurrent with the termination of the merger agreement. However, any
termination fee payable as a result of Huntway consummating an acquisition
proposal with another person as contemplated within the second and third bullet
points above must be paid to Valero Refining no later than simultaneously with
the consummation of such acquisition proposal.

AMENDMENTS AND WAIVERS

Subject to Delaware law, the parties may mutually agree to amend any provision
of the merger agreement at any time prior to the effective time of the merger
with the prior authorization of their respective board of directors. After
Huntway stockholders have approved the merger agreement, the parties may not
amend the merger agreement in a manner that would reduce or change the kind of
consideration stockholders will receive in the merger without further approval
of Huntway stockholders.

GUARANTEE

Valero Energy, the parent of Valero Refining, has guaranteed all of the
obligations and covenants of Valero Refining and HAC set forth in the merger
agreement, including the payment of the merger consideration. A copy of the
guarantee is attached to the merger agreement contained in Annex A of this proxy
statement.

RIGHT OF APPRAISAL

Pursuant to Section 262 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, any holder of
our common stock who does not wish to accept the merger consideration may
dissent from the merger and elect to have the fair value of such stockholder's
shares of common stock (exclusive of any element of value arising from the
accomplishment or expectation of the merger) judicially determined and paid to
such stockholder in cash, together with a fair rate of interest, if any,
provided that such stockholder complies with the provisions of Section 262. The
following discussion is not a complete statement of the law pertaining to
appraisal rights under the Delaware General Corporation Law, and is qualified in
its entirety by the full text of Section 262, which is provided in its entirety
as Annex B to this proxy statement. All references in Section 262 and in this
summary to a "stockholder" are to the record holder of the shares of common
stock as to which appraisal rights are asserted. A person having a beneficial
interest in shares of common stock held of record in the name of another person,
such as a broker or nominee, must act promptly to cause the record holder to
follow properly the steps summarized below and in a timely manner to perfect
appraisal rights.

Under Section 262, where a proposed merger is to be submitted for approval at a
meeting of stockholders, as in the case of the special meeting, the corporation,
not less than 20 days prior to the meeting, must notify each of its stockholders
entitled to appraisal rights that such appraisal rights are available and
include in such notice a copy of Section 262. This proxy statement shall
constitute such notice to the holders of our common stock and the applicable
statutory provisions of the Delaware General Corporation Law are attached to
this proxy statement as Annex B. If you wish to exercise such appraisal rights
or wish to preserve the right to do so, you should review carefully the
following discussion and Annex B to this proxy statement, because failure to
comply with the procedures specified in Section 262 timely and properly will
result in the loss of appraisal rights. Moreover, because of the complexity of
the procedures for exercising the right to seek appraisal of shares of common
stock, we believe that if you consider exercising such rights, you should seek
the advice of counsel.

If you wish to exercise your right to demand appraisal under Section 262 of the
Delaware General Corporation Law:

- - You must deliver to our Secretary a written demand for appraisal of your
  shares before the vote on the merger agreement at the special meeting, which
  demand will be sufficient if you reasonably inform us of your identity and
  that you intend to demand the appraisal of your shares.

- - You must not vote your shares of common stock in favor of the merger
  agreement. A proxy that does not contain voting instructions will, unless
  revoked, be voted in favor of the merger agreement. Therefore, if you vote by
  proxy and wish to exercise appraisal rights, you must vote against the merger
  agreement or abstain from voting on the merger agreement.

- - You must continuously hold such shares from the date of making the demand
  through the effective time of the merger. Accordingly, if you are a record
  holder of shares of our common stock on the date the written demand for
  appraisal is made, but thereafter transfer such shares prior to the effective
  time of the merger, you will lose any right to appraisal in respect of such
  shares.

None of voting (in person or by proxy) against, abstaining from voting on or
failing to vote on the proposal to approve the merger agreement will constitute
a written demand for appraisal within the meaning of Section 262. The written
demand for appraisal must be in addition to and separate from any such proxy or
vote.

Only a holder of record of shares of common stock issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the effective time of the merger is entitled to assert
appraisal rights with respect to the shares of

common stock registered in that holder's name. A demand for appraisal should be
executed by or on behalf of the stockholder of record, fully and correctly, as
such stockholder's name appears on such stock certificates, should specify the
stockholder's name and mailing address, the number of shares of common stock
owned and that such stockholder intends thereby to demand appraisal of such
stockholder's common stock. If the shares are owned of record in a fiduciary
capacity, such as by a trustee, guardian or custodian, execution of the demand
should be made in that capacity, and if the shares are owned of record by more
than one person as in a joint tenancy or tenancy in common, the demand should be
executed by or on behalf of all owners. An authorized agent, including one or
more joint owners, may execute a demand for appraisal on behalf of a
stockholder; however, the agent must identify the record owner or owners and
expressly disclose the fact that, in executing the demand, the agent is acting
as agent for such owner or owners. A record holder such as a broker who holds
shares as nominee for several beneficial owners may exercise appraisal rights
with respect to the shares held for one or more other beneficial owners while
not exercising such rights with respect to the shares held for one or more
beneficial owners; in such case, the written demand should set forth the number
of shares as to which appraisal is sought, and where no number of shares is
expressly mentioned the demand will be presumed to cover all shares held in the
name of the record owner. If you hold your shares in brokerage accounts or other
nominee forms and you wish to exercise appraisal rights, you are urged to
consult with your brokers to determine appropriate procedures for the making of
a demand for appraisal by such nominee.

If you elect to exercise appraisal rights pursuant to Section 262, you should
mail or deliver a written demand to: Huntway Refining Company, 25129 The Old
Road, Suite 322, Newhall, California 91381; Attention: Earl G. Fleisher, Chief
Financial Officer and Secretary.

Within 10 days after the effective time of the merger, Huntway, as the surviving
corporation, must send a notice of effectiveness of the merger to each former
stockholder of Huntway who has made a written demand for appraisal in accordance
with Section 262 and who has not voted in favor of the merger agreement. Within
120 days after the effective time of the merger, but not thereafter, either
Huntway or any stockholder who has complied with the requirements of
Section 262 may file a petition in the Delaware Court of Chancery demanding a
determination of the value of the shares of common stock held by all
stockholders who are entitled to appraisal rights. Huntway is under no
obligation to and has no present intent to file a petition for appraisal, and
stockholders seeking to exercise appraisal rights should not assume that Huntway
will file such a petition or that Huntway will initiate any negotiations with
respect to the fair value of such shares. Accordingly, stockholders who desire
to have their shares appraised should initiate any petitions necessary for the
perfection of their appraisal rights within the time periods and in the manner
prescribed in Section 262. Inasmuch as Huntway has no obligation to file such a
petition, the failure of a stockholder to do so within the period specified
could nullify such stockholder's previous written demand for appraisal. In any
event, at any time within 60 days after the effective time of the merger (or at
any time thereafter with the written consent of Huntway), any stockholder who
has demanded appraisal has the right to withdraw the demand and to accept
payment of the merger consideration.

Pursuant to the merger agreement, Huntway has agreed to give Valero Refining
prompt notice of any demands for appraisal received by it and Valero Refining
shall have the right to participate in negotiations and proceedings with respect
to such demands to the extent permitted by law. Huntway may not, except with the
prior written consent of Valero Refining, make any payment with respect to any
demands for appraisal, or offer to settle, or settle, any such demands.

Within 120 days after the effective time of the merger, any stockholder who has
complied with the provisions of Section 262 to that point in time will be
entitled to receive from Huntway, upon written request, a statement setting
forth the aggregate number of shares not voted in favor of the merger agreement
and with respect to which demands for appraisal have been received and the
aggregate

number of holders of such shares. Huntway must mail such statement to the
stockholder within 10 days after receipt of such request or within 10 days after
expiration of the period for delivery of demands for appraisals under
Section 262, whichever is later.

A stockholder timely filing a petition for appraisal with the Delaware Court of
Chancery must deliver a copy to Huntway, which will then be obligated within
20 days to provide the Delaware Court of Chancery with a duly verified list
containing the names and addresses of all stockholders who have demanded
appraisal of their shares and with whom agreements as to the value of their
shares have not been reached by Huntway. After notice to such stockholders, the
Delaware Court of Chancery is empowered to conduct a hearing on the petition to
determine which stockholders are entitled to appraisal rights. The Delaware
Court of Chancery may require stockholders who have demanded an appraisal for
their shares and who hold stock represented by certificates to submit their
certificates to the Register in Chancery for notation thereon of the pendency of
the appraisal proceedings, and if any stockholder fails to comply with the
requirement, the Delaware Court of Chancery may dismiss the proceedings as to
that stockholder.

After determining the stockholders entitled to an appraisal, the Delaware Court
of Chancery will appraise the "fair value" of their shares, exclusive of any
element of value arising from the accomplishment or expectation of the merger,
together with a fair rate of interest, if any, to be paid upon the amount
determined to be the fair value. The costs of the action may be determined by
the Delaware Court of Chancery and taxed upon the parties as the Delaware Court
of Chancery deems equitable. Upon application of a stockholder, the Delaware
Court of Chancery may also order that all or a portion of the expenses incurred
by any stockholder in connection with the appraisal proceeding, including,
without limitation, reasonable attorneys' fees and the fees and expenses of
experts, be charged pro rata against the value of all of the shares entitled to
appraisal. IF YOU ARE CONSIDERING SEEKING APPRAISAL, YOU SHOULD BE AWARE THAT
THE FAIR VALUE OF YOUR SHARES AS DETERMINED UNDER SECTION 262 COULD BE MORE
THAN, THE SAME AS OR LESS THAN THE MERGER CONSIDERATION YOU WOULD RECEIVE
PURSUANT TO THE MERGER AGREEMENT IF YOU DID NOT SEEK APPRAISAL OF YOUR SHARES.
YOU SHOULD ALSO BE AWARE THAT INVESTMENT BANKING OPINIONS ARE NOT OPINIONS AS TO
FAIR VALUE UNDER SECTION 262.

In determining fair value and, if applicable, a fair rate of interest, the
Delaware Court of Chancery is to take into account all relevant factors. In
WEINBERGER V. UOP, Inc., the Delaware Supreme Court discussed the factors that
could be considered in determining fair value in an appraisal proceeding,
stating that "proof of value by any techniques or methods that are generally
considered acceptable in the financial community and otherwise admissible in
court" should be considered, and that "fair price obviously requires
consideration of all relevant factors involving the value of a company." The
Delaware Supreme Court stated that, in making this determination of fair value,
the court must consider market value, asset value, dividends, earnings
prospects, the nature of the enterprise and any other facts that could be
ascertained as of the date of the merger that throw any light on future
prospects of the merged corporation. In WEINBERGER, the Delaware Supreme Court
stated that "elements of future value, including the nature of the enterprise,
that are known or susceptible of proof as of the date of the merger and not the
product of speculation, may be considered." Section 262 provides that fair value
is to be "exclusive of any element of value arising from the accomplishment or
expectation of the merger."

Any stockholder who has duly demanded an appraisal in compliance with
Section 262 will not, after the effective time of the merger, be entitled to
vote the shares subject to such demand for any purpose or be entitled to the
payment of dividends or other distributions on those shares (except dividends or
other distributions payable to holders of record of shares as of a record date
prior to the effective time of the merger).

Any stockholder may withdraw such stockholder's demand for appraisal and accept
the merger consideration by delivering to Huntway a written withdrawal of such
stockholder's demand for appraisal, except that (1) any such attempt to withdraw
made more than 60 days after the effective time of the merger will require
written approval of Huntway and (2) no appraisal proceeding in the Delaware
Court of Chancery shall be dismissed as to any stockholder without the approval
of the Delaware Court of Chancery, and such approval may be conditioned upon
such terms as the Delaware Court of Chancery deems just. If Huntway does not
approve a stockholder's request to withdraw a demand for appraisal when such
approval is required or if the Delaware Court of Chancery does not approve the
dismissal of an appraisal proceeding, the stockholder would be entitled to
receive only the appraised value determined in any such appraisal proceeding,
which value could be lower than the value of the merger consideration.

FAILURE TO COMPLY STRICTLY WITH ALL OF THE PROCEDURES SET FORTH IN SECTION 262
OF THE DELAWARE GENERAL CORPORATION LAW WILL RESULT IN THE LOSS OF YOUR
STATUTORY APPRAISAL RIGHTS. CONSEQUENTLY, IF YOU WISH TO EXERCISE APPRAISAL
RIGHTS, YOU ARE URGED TO CONSULT LEGAL COUNSEL BEFORE ATTEMPTING TO EXERCISE
SUCH RIGHTS.

PROVISIONS FOR UNAFFILIATED SECURITY HOLDERS

No provision has been made to grant unaffiliated stockholders of Huntway access
to corporate files of Huntway or any other party to the merger or to obtain
counsel or appraisal services at the expense of Huntway or any other such party.

STOCKHOLDERS PROPOSALS

As a result of the pending merger, we do not currently intend to hold an annual
meeting of stockholders in 2001. We are holding a special meeting as
contemplated by this proxy statement. If the merger is approved at the special
meeting and is consummated, we will have no public stockholders and there will
be no public participation in any future meetings of stockholders. However, if
the merger is not approved at the special meeting or is not consummated, our
public stockholders will continue to be entitled to attend and participate in
stockholder meetings and we anticipate that a 2001 annual meeting of
stockholders will be held as soon as practicable following the date the pending
merger is terminated. Any Huntway stockholder intending to submit a proposal for
inclusion in our proxy statement and form of proxy relating to the 2001 annual
meeting of stockholders, in the event that such meeting is held, must submit the
proposal in accordance with the requirements of Rule 14a-8 promulgated under the
Exchange Act. Thus, we must receive the proposal a reasonable time before we
begin to print our proxy materials, which we interpret to be 120 days before we
begin to print them. For any proposal that is not submitted for inclusion in our
proxy statement for any 2001 annual meeting, but is instead sought to be
presented directly at the 2001 annual meeting, stockholders must comply with the
notice requirements and procedures outlined in our bylaws. We have filed our
bylaws with, and a copy of our bylaws can be obtained from, the SEC.

                          AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER

    AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER dated as of March 20, 2001 (this "AGREEMENT")
by and among Huntway Refining Company, a Delaware corporation (including its
predecessor as appropriate, "TARGET"), Valero Refining and Marketing Company, a
Delaware corporation ("BUYER"), and HAC Company, a Delaware corporation and a
wholly-owned subsidiary of Buyer ("BUYERSUB"). Certain capitalized terms used
herein have the meanings set forth in Article 10.

                                    RECITALS

    This Agreement contemplates a transaction in which Target shall become a
wholly-owned Subsidiary of Buyer through a merger of BuyerSub with and into
Target, with Target continuing as the surviving corporation. The stockholders of
Target will receive cash in exchange for their capital stock in Target.

    NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing, and of the
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements contained herein, and
intending to be legally bound, the parties hereto agree as follows:

                                   ARTICLE 1
                                   THE MERGER

    SECTION 1.01  THE MERGER.

    (a) At the Effective Time, BuyerSub shall be merged (the "MERGER") with and
into Target in accordance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement and
the DGCL, at which time the separate existence of BuyerSub shall cease and
Target shall continue its existence. In its capacity as the corporation
surviving the Merger, this Agreement sometimes refers to Target as the
"SURVIVING CORPORATION."

    (b) As soon as practicable after satisfaction or, to the extent permitted
hereby, waiver of all conditions to the Merger set forth herein, Target shall
file a certificate of merger (the "CERTIFICATE OF MERGER") with the Secretary of
State of the State of Delaware (the "SECRETARY") and make all other filings or
recordings required by Section 251 of the DGCL in connection with the Merger.
The "EFFECTIVE TIME" shall be the date and time that the Certificate of Merger
is filed with the Secretary unless a later date and/or time is otherwise agreed
upon by the parties and specified in the Certificate of Merger, in which case,
the Effective Time shall be the date and time so specified.

    (c) From and after the Effective Time, the Merger shall have the effects set
forth in Section 259 of the DGCL.

    SECTION 1.02  CLOSING OF THE MERGER.

    (a) The closing of the Merger (the "CLOSING") shall be held at the offices
of Kirkland & Ellis, 777 South Figueroa Street, Los Angeles, California (or such
other place as agreed by the parties) within five Business Days after
satisfaction or, to the extent permitted hereby, waiver of the conditions set
forth in Article 8 (other than conditions with respect to actions the respective
parties are to take at the Closing itself), unless the parties hereto agree on
another date.

    (b) It is contemplated that at the Closing Buyer shall among other things
(i) fully satisfy and discharge any indebtedness of Target under the Bank of
America Loan Agreement and obtain and cause to become effective a back-up letter
of credit to certain letters of credit issued for the benefit of Target pursuant
to the Bank of America Loan Agreement as contemplated by Section 7.06(a),
(ii) fully satisfy and discharge all of the indebtedness of Target under the
Boeing Capital Loan Agreement as contemplated by Section 7.06(b),
(iii) purchase all of the Convertible Notes as

                                      A-5

contemplated by Section 7.06(c) and (iv) purchase all of the Junior Subordinated
Debentures as contemplated by Section 7.06(d). As a result of the foregoing, it
is also contemplated that at Closing all Liens arising under the Target Credit
Documents shall be terminated and released.

    SECTION 1.03  ORGANIZATIONAL DOCUMENTS.  At the Effective Time (i) the
certificate of incorporation of Target shall be amended to read in its entirety
as the certificate of incorporation of BuyerSub in effect immediately prior to
the Effective Time (except that the name of the Surviving Corporation shall be
the name of Target as specified in its certificate of incorporation in effect
immediately prior to the Effective Time) and as so amended shall be the
certificate of incorporation of the Surviving Corporation until thereafter
amended in accordance with applicable law and (ii) the by-laws of BuyerSub in
effect immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the by-laws of the
Surviving Corporation until thereafter amended in accordance with applicable
law.

    SECTION 1.04  DIRECTORS AND OFFICERS.  From and after the Effective Time
(until successors are duly elected or appointed and qualified), the directors
and officers of BuyerSub immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the
directors and officers of the Surviving Corporation.

                                   ARTICLE 2
                  CONVERSION OF SECURITIES AND RELATED MATTERS

    SECTION 2.01  CONVERSION OF CAPITAL STOCK.  At the Effective Time and by
virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of Target, Buyer or
BuyerSub or their respective stockholders:

    (a) Each share of common stock, $0.01 par value per share, of BuyerSub
(each, a "BUYERSUB COMMON SHARE") outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time shall be converted into and become one share of common stock of the
Surviving Corporation.

    (b) Except as otherwise provided in Section 2.01(c) and Section 2.01(d),
each Target Common Share outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall be converted into cash in an amount equal to $1.90 (the "MERGER
CONSIDERATION"). All such Target Common Shares, when so converted, shall no
longer be outstanding, shall automatically be canceled and retired and shall
cease to exist. Each holder of a stock certificate formerly representing Target
Common Shares shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto at the
Effective Time, except the right to receive, without interest, the applicable
Merger Consideration in accordance with this Agreement, except as otherwise
provided in Section 2.01(c) and Section 2.01(d).

    (c) Each Target Common Share held by Target as treasury stock or owned by
Buyer or any Buyer Subsidiary immediately prior to the Effective Time shall
automatically be canceled and retired and shall cease to exist, and no payment
shall be made in respect thereof.

    (d) Each Target Common Share as to which a written demand for appraisal is
filed in accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL at or prior to the Target
Stockholder Meeting and not withdrawn at or prior to the Target Stockholder
Meeting and which is not voted in favor of the Merger shall be converted into
the right to receive payment from the Surviving Corporation with respect thereto
in accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL and shall not be converted into or
represent a right to receive the Merger Consideration (a "DISSENTING SHARE"),
unless and until the holder thereof shall have failed to perfect, or shall have
effectively withdrawn or lost the right to appraisal of and payment for such
Target Common Share under Section 262 of the DGCL, in which event and at such
time such Target Common Share shall be converted into the right to receive,
without interest, the Merger Consideration. Target shall give Buyer prompt
notice upon receipt by Target of any and all written demands for appraisal
rights, withdrawal of such demands and any other written communications
delivered to Target pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL, and Target shall give
Buyer the opportunity, to the extent permitted by law, to participate in all
negotiations and

proceedings with respect to such demands. Except with the prior written consent
of Buyer, Target shall not voluntarily make any payment with respect to any
demand for appraisal rights and shall not settle or offer to settle any such
demand. Each holder of Dissenting Shares who becomes entitled, pursuant to the
provisions of Section 262 of the DGCL, to payment for such Dissenting Shares
under the provisions of Section 262 of the DGCL shall receive payment thereof
from the Surviving Corporation and such Target Common Shares shall no longer be
outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and retired and shall cease to
exist.

    SECTION 2.02  EXCHANGE OF CERTIFICATES FOR MERGER CONSIDERATION.

    (a) EXCHANGE AGENT. Promptly after the date hereof but in any event prior to
the Target Stockholder Meeting, Buyer shall appoint a bank or trust company
acceptable to Target (on terms acceptable to Target) as agent (the "EXCHANGE
"AGENT") for the benefit of the holders of Target Common Shares, for the purpose
of exchanging for the Merger Consideration pursuant to this Article 2
certificates ("CERTIFICATES") that immediately prior to the Effective Time
represent outstanding Target Common Shares. Buyer shall deliver to the Exchange
Agent upon the Closing the Merger Consideration to be paid in respect of Target
Common Shares converted into the Merger Consideration (that is, not including
any then Dissenting Shares) pursuant to this Article 2 (the "EXCHANGE FUND"). In
addition, in the event that any then Dissenting Share thereafter ceases to be a
Dissenting Share and the underlying Target Common Share is thereupon converted
into the Merger Consideration, Buyer thereupon shall deliver immediately to the
Exchange Agent for inclusion in the Exchange Fund the appropriate Merger
Consideration. Except as contemplated by subsections (d), (e), (f) and (g) of
this Section, the Exchange Fund shall not be used for any other purpose. The
Buyer shall pay all charges and expenses of the Exchange Agent.

    (b) EXCHANGE PROCEDURES. As promptly as practicable after the Effective
Time, but in any event not more than five Business Days after the date of the
Effective Time, Buyer shall send, or will cause the Exchange Agent to send, to
each holder of record of a Certificate or Certificates a letter of transmittal
and instructions (which shall be in customary form and specify that delivery
shall be effected, and risk of loss and title shall pass, only upon delivery of
Certificates to the Exchange Agent) for use in the exchange contemplated by this
Section. Upon surrender of a Certificate to the Exchange Agent, together with a
duly executed and completed letter of transmittal, the holder of such
Certificate shall be entitled to promptly receive in exchange therefor the
Merger Consideration as provided in this Article 2 in respect of the Target
Common Shares represented by such Certificate less such amounts, if any, as are
required to be deducted and withheld by the Surviving Corporation, Exchange
Agent or Buyer under the Code or any provision of state or local tax law. Until
surrendered as contemplated by this Section, each Certificate shall be deemed
upon and at any time after the Effective Time to represent only the right to
receive the appropriate Merger Consideration without interest as provided in
this Article 2, except for any Dissenting Share. If any Merger Consideration is
to be paid to a Person other than the Person in whose name the Certificate is
registered, it shall be a condition to such payment that in the judgment of the
Exchange Agent the Certificate so surrendered shall be properly endorsed or
otherwise be in proper form for transfer and that the Person requesting such
payment shall pay to the Exchange Agent any transfer or other taxes required as
a result of such payment to a Person other than the registered holder of such
Certificate or establish to the satisfaction of the Exchange Agent that such tax
has been paid or is not payable. If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen
or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person
claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by
Buyer, the posting by such Person of a bond, in such reasonable amount as Buyer
may direct, as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with
respect to such Certificate, the Exchange Agent will deliver in exchange for
such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate, the appropriate Merger Consideration
as contemplated by this Article 2.

                                      A-7

    (c) NO FURTHER OWNERSHIP RIGHTS IN TARGET COMMON SHARES. The Merger
Consideration paid upon surrender of Certificates in accordance with the terms
hereof shall be deemed to have been issued in full satisfaction of all rights
pertaining to the Target Common Shares represented thereby. As of the Effective
Time, the stock transfer books of Target shall be closed and there shall be no
further registration of transfers on the stock transfer books of Target.

    (d) RETURN OF MERGER CONSIDERATION. At any time after the first anniversary
of the date of the Closing, upon written demand by Buyer, the Exchange Agent
shall deliver to Buyer any portion of the Merger Consideration made available to
the Exchange Agent pursuant to this Section that then remains undistributed.
Holders of Certificates who have not complied with this Section prior to such
delivery to Buyer shall thereafter look only to Buyer for payment of the
appropriate Merger Consideration.

    (e) NO LIABILITY. None of Buyer, the Surviving Corporation or the Exchange
Agent shall be liable to any Person in respect of any Target Common Shares for
any amounts paid to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned
property, escheat or similar law. Any amounts remaining unclaimed by any holder
of Target Common Shares immediately prior to such time when such amounts would
otherwise escheat to or become the property of any Governmental Entity shall, to
the extent permitted by applicable law, become the property of Buyer, free and
clear of all claims or interest of any Person previously entitled thereto.

    (f)  WITHHOLDING RIGHTS. Each of the Surviving Corporation, the Exchange
Agent and Buyer shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the Merger
Consideration otherwise payable hereunder to any Person such amounts, if any, it
is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment
under any provision of Federal, state, local or foreign income tax law. To the
extent that the Surviving Corporation, the Exchange Agent or Buyer so withholds
any such amounts, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of
this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of Target Common Shares in
respect of which such deduction and withholding was made by the Surviving
Corporation, the Exchange Agent or Buyer, as the case may be.

    (g) INVESTMENT OF THE EXCHANGE FUND. The Exchange Agent shall invest any and
all cash included in the Exchange Fund only in an insured money market account;
provided that no loss thereon or thereof shall affect the amounts payable by the
Buyer to the holders of Target Common Shares pursuant to this Article 2. Any
interest and other income resulting from such investment shall promptly be paid
to Buyer, and Buyer shall replace promptly any portion of the Exchange Fund
which the Exchange Agent loses through such investment.

    SECTION 2.03  TARGET STOCK OPTIONS.

    (a) As soon as possible following the date of this Agreement and pursuant to
the terms of the respective Target Option Plan, the Board of Directors of Target
(and, if appropriate, any committee administering any Target Option Plan) shall
adopt such resolutions and/or take such other actions as may be required or
appropriate in its sole discretion to effect the provisions of this Section.
Each stock option to purchase Target Common Shares (each, a "TARGET OPTION")
outstanding under either Target Option Plan immediately prior to the Effective
Time, whether or not vested or exercisable, shall become fully vested and
exercisable at the Effective Time (other than any portion of a Target Option
held by a member of the board of directors of Target that failed to vest as
originally scheduled due to such member not meeting applicable attendance
requirements) and shall be deemed to constitute an option to acquire, on the
same terms and conditions (other than as expressly provided in this Section) as
were applicable under such Target Option immediately prior to the Effective
Time, the same Merger Consideration as the holder of such Target Option would
have been entitled to receive pursuant to this Agreement had such holder
exercised such Target Option in full immediately prior to the Effective Time,
and the Buyer so acknowledges and agrees to the foregoing.

                                      A-8

    (b) At the Closing, Buyer shall pay to each holder of a then outstanding
Target Option who has theretofore delivered to the Chief Financial Officer of
Target an executed Option Exercise/ Payment Direction an amount equal to the
excess of (x) the Merger Consideration multiplied by the number of Target Common
Shares purchasable pursuant to such Target Option immediately prior to the
Effective Time over (y) the aggregate exercise price for the Target Common
Shares purchasable pursuant to such Target Option immediately prior to the
Effective Time (in each case assuming such Target Option had been fully vested
and fully exercisable immediately prior to the Effective Time as contemplated by
the immediately preceding subsection), less any amounts as are required to be
deducted and withheld under the Code or any provision of state or local tax law
in connection with such payment (the "OPTION SPREAD PAYMENT"). The Option Spread
Payment shall be paid by Buyer in cash by certified check or wire transfer of
immediately available funds as directed in the respective Option
Exercise/Payment Direction. After the execution and delivery hereof, Target
shall make available to each of its employees and other Persons who hold Target
Options the opportunity to enter into and deliver an Option Exercise/Payment
Direction.

    SECTION 2.04  [INTENTIONALLY OMITTED]

    SECTION 2.05  FURTHER ASSURANCES.  At and after the Effective Time, the
officers and directors of the Surviving Corporation will be authorized to
execute and deliver, in the name and on behalf of Target or BuyerSub, any deeds,
bills of sale, assignments or assurances and to take and do, in the name and on
behalf of Target or BuyerSub, any other actions and things to vest, perfect or
confirm of record or otherwise in the Surviving Corporation any and all right,
title and interest in, to and under any of the rights, properties or assets of
Target acquired or to be acquired by the Surviving Corporation as a result of,
or in connection with, the Merger.

and is in good standing in each jurisdiction where the character of the property

judgment, injunction, order or decree binding upon or applicable to Target or
the Target Subsidiary (except that no representation or warranty is made with
respect to any antitrust statute, regulation, rule or other such restriction),
(c) give rise to a right of termination, cancellation or acceleration (with or
without due notice or lapse of time or both) of any material right or obligation

violation of Section 406(a) or (b) of ERISA or any "prohibited transaction" (as
defined in Section 4975(c)(1) of the Code) which would subject Target, Buyer,
BuyerSub or the Surviving Corporation to any material taxes, penalties or other
liabilities resulting from such prohibited transaction and, to the Knowledge of
Target, no condition exists that would subject any of Target, Buyer, BuyerSub or
the Surviving Corporation to any material excise penalty tax or fine related to
any Target Employee Plan.

    SECTION 3.16  TRANSACTIONS WITH AFFILIATES.  Since December 31, 1999, there

business as a foreign corporation and is in good standing in each jurisdiction
where the character of the property owned or leased by it or the nature of its
activities makes such qualification necessary, except where the failure to be so

incorporation, by-laws and/or other organizational documents as currently in
effect.

    SECTION 4.02  CORPORATE AUTHORIZATION; APPROVALS.  The execution, delivery

each of Buyer and BuyerSub and of Buyer in its capacity as the sole stockholder
of BuyerSub). Assuming that this Agreement constitutes the valid and binding
obligation of Target, this Agreement constitutes a valid and binding agreement

Corporation, Buyer or BuyerSub, (b) assuming that all of the consents, approvals
and filings contemplated by clauses (a) to and including (c) of Section 4.03 are
obtained and/or made, contravene or conflict with or constitute a violation of
any provision of any law, regulation, judgment, injunction, order or decree
binding upon or applicable to Valero Energy Corporation or any Subsidiary
thereof, including Buyer and BuyerSub (except that no representation or warranty
is made with respect to any antitrust statute, regulation, rule or other such
restriction), (c) give rise to a right of termination, cancellation or
acceleration (with or without due notice or lapse of time or both) of any

imposition of any Lien on any material asset of Valero Energy Corporation or any
Subsidiary thereof, including Buyer and BuyerSub, other than, in the case of
each of (b), (c) and (d), any such items that would not, individually or in the

outstanding shares of each class of capital stock of BuyerSub. There are no
outstanding options, warrants, purchase rights, subscription rights, conversion
rights, exchange rights or other contracts or commitments that could require the
BuyerSub to issue, sell or otherwise cause to become outstanding stock
appreciation, phantom stock, profit participation or similar rights with respect
to the BuyerSub.

Buyer expressly for inclusion in the Proxy Statement will at the time of the
mailing thereof and at the time of the Target Stockholder Meeting not contain
any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact

the

                                      A-21

fiduciary duties of the Target board of directors as such duties would exist
under applicable law in the absence of this Section 5.03; and (y) prior to

Proposal or making any disclosure required by applicable law or stock exchange
rule or regulation.

    (c) Pursuant to the terms of Section 9.01(c)(ii), Target may terminate this
Agreement in the event of a Superior Proposal or if otherwise required in order
to satisfy the fiduciary duties of the Target board of directors as such duties
would exist under applicable law in the absence of this Section 5.03; provided
that Target may not exercise its right to so terminate under
Section 9.01(c)(ii) and may not enter into a binding agreement (other than a
confidentiality agreement as contemplated by clause (y) in the first sentence
contained in Section 5.03(a)) with respect to such Superior Proposal, unless
prior to or concurrent with such termination Target shall have paid to Buyer the
Termination Fee as contemplated by Section 9.03.

affected by the transactions contemplated hereby and amounts held by employees
of Target in its Profit Sharing and Tax Deferred Savings Plan (401(k) Plan) and

shall cause the Surviving Corporation to honor and perform, in accordance with

such disclosure is required by applicable law or governmental, stock exchange or
securities market rule or regulation or by order of a court of competent
jurisdiction (in which case prior to making such disclosure the party which
proposes to make such disclosure shall give written notice to the other parties,
describing in reasonable detail the proposed content of such disclosure, and
shall provide each other party a reasonable opportunity to review and comment
upon the form and substance of such disclosure).

[TO BE INSERTED: NAME AND
ADDRESS OF STOCK OPTION HOLDER]

Dear Huntway stock option holder:

    As has been publicly announced, Huntway Refining Company ("HUNTWAY") has
entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger dated as of March 20, 2001 (the
"Merger Agreement") pursuant to which a subsidiary of Valero Refining and
Marketing Company ("Buyer"), the parent company of which is Valero Energy
Corporation, will be merged with and into Huntway, with Huntway continuing as
the surviving corporation and as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Buyer. The merger
is subject to a number of closing conditions, including without limitation
Huntway stockholder approval. Under the Merger Agreement, the stockholders of
Huntway will be entitled to receive upon the merger an amount in cash equal to
$1.90 in exchange for each of their shares of Huntway common stock. The merger
is currently expected to close in [             ], 2001.

    Pursuant to the terms of your stock options and the related Huntway stock
incentive/option plan, following the merger, your stock options will be
exercisable only for the consideration paid in the merger (that is, cash in an
amount equal to the cash paid per share of Huntway common stock in the merger,
without any interest thereon) instead of for Huntway common stock. As a
convenience to you, Huntway has made an arrangement with Buyer that will permit
you to be paid an amount equal to the economic value of your options as
described in the next paragraph (if and to the extent they remain outstanding
immediately prior to the merger) in connection with the closing under the Merger
Agreement. This arrangement will allow you to obtain earlier payment of such
economic value (which will not increase with the passage of time after the
merger) and to avoid among other things having to exercise your stock options at
or following the merger and pay the related option exercise price.

    In the event that you take advantage of the arrangement contemplated by this
document, the amount that will be paid to you with respect to your stock options
as listed below will equal (that is, the economic value of your options will
equal) the excess of (x) $1.90 (the amount in cash paid per share of Huntway
common stock in the merger) multiplied by the number of shares of Huntway common
stock purchasable pursuant to your Huntway stock options that are outstanding
immediately prior to the merger over (y) the aggregate exercise price for the
shares of Huntway common stock purchasable pursuant to your Huntway stock
options that are outstanding immediately prior to the merger, in each case
assuming such stock options had been fully vested and fully exercisable
immediately prior to the merger, less any amounts as are required to be deducted
and withheld under any provision of Federal, state or local tax law in
connection with such payment. In the event that the Merger Agreement is amended
after the execution and delivery thereof by Huntway and Buyer to provide for an
increase in the amount of consideration to be paid per share of Huntway common
stock in the merger, such greater consideration provided for in the Merger
Agreement as so amended shall replace the amount identified under clause (x) in
the prior sentence. This economic value payment is required under the Merger
Agreement to be paid by Buyer in cash by certified check or wire transfer of
immediately available funds as you direct below, subject to your satisfaction of
the requirements set forth in this document.

                                      A-44

    TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THIS ARRANGEMENT, PLEASE COMPLETE AND SIGN THIS
DOCUMENT AS INDICATED BELOW AND DELIVER THIS DOCUMENT TO THE CHIEF FINANCIAL
OFFICER OF HUNTWAY AT THE ABOVE ADDRESS. IN ORDER FOR YOU TO BE PAID THE
APPROPRIATE ECONOMIC VALUE IN CONNECTION WITH THE CLOSING UNDER THE MERGER
AGREEMENT, YOU MUST DELIVER THE EXECUTED ORIGINAL OF THIS FORM TO HUNTWAY AS
INDICATED ON OR PRIOR TO [             ], 2001 OR SUCH LATER DATE AS HUNTWAY MAY
SUBSEQUENTLY INDICATE IN WRITING. WHEN DELIVERED TO HUNTWAY, THIS DOCUMENT MUST
BE ACCOMPANIED BY AN EXECUTED ORIGINAL OF EACH OF YOUR STOCK OPTION AGREEMENTS
LISTED BELOW.

    Upon payment of the appropriate economic value as contemplated by this
document, it is understood that all of your Huntway stock options shall be
canceled, and by signing this document and delivering it to the Chief Financial
Officer of Huntway, you so agree to such cancellation.

    Following is a list of each of the Huntway stock options you currently hold
and the respective current exercise price. You represent to Huntway that you own
the options listed below, free and clear of any and all liens, pledges, security
interests or other such encumbrances, and that you have the sole power and
authority to enter into and perform this agreement.

              SECTION 262 OF THE DELAWARE GENERAL CORPORATION LAW

Section 262 of the Delaware General Corporation Law provides:

    (a) Any stockholder of a corporation of this State who holds shares of stock
on the date of the making of a demand pursuant to subsection (d) of this section
with respect to such shares, who continuously holds such shares through the
effective date of the merger or consolidation, who has otherwise complied with
subsection (d) of this section and who has neither voted in favor of the merger
or consolidation nor consented thereto in writing pursuant to Section 228 of
this title shall be entitled to an appraisal by the Court of Chancery of the
fair value of the stockholder's shares of stock under the circumstances
described in subsections (b) and (c) of this section. As used in this section,
the word "stockholder" means a holder of record of stock in a stock corporation
and also a member of record of a nonstock corporation; the words "stock" and
"share" mean and include what is ordinarily meant by those words and also
membership or membership interest of a member of a nonstock corporation; and the
words "depository receipt" mean a receipt or other instrument issued by a
depository representing an interest in one or more shares, or fractions thereof,
solely of stock of a corporation, which stock is deposited with the depository.

    (b) Appraisal rights shall be available for the shares of any class or
series of stock of a constituent corporation in a merger or consolidation to be
effected pursuant to Section 251 (other than a merger effected pursuant to
Section 251(g) of this title), Section 252, Section 254, Section 257,
Section 258, Section 263 or Section 264 of this title:

        (1) Provided, however, that no appraisal rights under this section shall
    be available for the shares of any class or series of stock, which stock, or
    depository receipts in respect thereof, at the record date fixed to
    determine the stockholders entitled to receive notice of and to vote at the
    meeting of stockholders to act upon the agreement of merger or
    consolidation, were either (i) listed on a national securities exchange or
    designated as a national market system security on an interdealer quotation
    system by the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. or (ii) held
    of record by more than 2,000 holders; and further provided that no appraisal
    rights shall be available for any shares of stock of the constituent
    corporation surviving a merger if the merger did not require for its
    approval the vote of the stockholders of the surviving corporation as
    provided in subsection (f) of Section 251 of this title.

        (2) Notwithstanding paragraph (1) of this subsection, appraisal rights
    under this section shall be available for the shares of any class or series
    of stock of a constituent corporation if the holders thereof are required by
    the terms of an agreement of merger or consolidation pursuant to
    Sections 251, 252, 254, 257, 258, 263 and 264 of this title to accept for
    such stock anything except:

           a.  Shares of stock of the corporation surviving or resulting from
       such merger or consolidation, or depository receipts in respect thereof;

           b.  Shares of stock of any other corporation, or depository receipts
       in respect thereof, which shares of stock (or depository receipts in
       respect thereof) or depository receipts at the effective date of the
       merger or consolidation will be either listed on a national securities
       exchange or designated as a national market system security on an
       interdealer quotation system by the National Association of Securities
       Dealers, Inc. or held of record by more than 2,000 holders;

           c.  Cash in lieu of fractional shares or fractional depository
       receipts described in the foregoing subparagraphs a. and b. of this
       paragraph; or

                                      B-1

           d.  Any combination of the shares of stock, depository receipts and
       cash in lieu of fractional shares or fractional depository receipts
       described in the foregoing subparagraphs a., b. and c. of this paragraph.

        (3) In the event all of the stock of a subsidiary Delaware corporation
    party to a merger effected under Section 253 of this title is not owned by
    the parent corporation immediately prior to the merger, appraisal rights
    shall be available for the shares of the subsidiary Delaware corporation.

    (c) Any corporation may provide in its certificate of incorporation that
appraisal rights under this section shall be available for the shares of any
class or series of its stock as a result of an amendment to its certificate of
incorporation, any merger or consolidation in which the corporation is a
constituent corporation or the sale of all or substantially all of the assets of
the corporation. If the certificate of incorporation contains such a provision,
the procedures of this section, including those set forth in subsections
(d) and (e) of this section, shall apply as nearly as is practicable.

    (d) Appraisal rights shall be perfected as follows:

        (1) If a proposed merger or consolidation for which appraisal rights are
    provided under this section is to be submitted for approval at a meeting of
    stockholders, the corporation, not less than 20 days prior to the meeting,
    shall notify each of its stockholders who was such on the record date for
    such meeting with respect to shares for which appraisal rights are available
    pursuant to subsection (b) or (c) hereof that appraisal rights are available
    for any or all of the shares of the constituent corporations, and shall
    include in such notice a copy of this section. Each stockholder electing to
    demand the appraisal of such stockholder's shares shall deliver to the
    corporation, before the taking of the vote on the merger or consolidation, a
    written demand for appraisal of such stockholder's shares. Such demand will
    be sufficient if it reasonably informs the corporation of the identity of
    the stockholder and that the stockholder intends thereby to demand the
    appraisal of such stockholder's shares. A proxy or vote against the merger
    or consolidation shall not constitute such a demand. A stockholder electing
    to take such action must do so by a separate written demand as herein
    provided. Within 10 days after the effective date of such merger or
    consolidation, the surviving or resulting corporation shall notify each
    stockholder of each constituent corporation who has complied with this
    subsection and has not voted in favor of or consented to the merger or
    consolidation of the date that the merger or consolidation has become
    effective; or

        (2) If the merger or consolidation was approved pursuant to Section 228
    or Section 253 of this title, each constituent corporation, either before
    the effective date of the merger or consolidation or within ten days
    thereafter, shall notify each of the holders of any class or series of stock
    of such constituent corporation who are entitled to appraisal rights of the
    approval of the merger or consolidation and that appraisal rights are
    available for any or all shares of such class or series of stock of such
    constituent corporation, and shall include in such notice a copy of this
    section; provided that, if the notice is given on or after the effective
    date of the merger or consolidation, such notice shall be given by the
    surviving or resulting corporation to all such holders of any class or
    series of stock of a constituent corporation that are entitled to appraisal
    rights. Such notice may, and, if given on or after the effective date of the
    merger or consolidation, shall, also notify such stockholders of the
    effective date of the merger or consolidation. Any stockholder entitled to
    appraisal rights may, within 20 days after the date of mailing of such
    notice, demand in writing from the surviving or resulting corporation the
    appraisal of such holder's shares. Such demand will be sufficient if it
    reasonably informs the corporation of the identity of the stockholder and
    that the stockholder intends thereby to demand the appraisal of such
    holder's shares. If such notice did not notify stockholders of the effective
    date of the merger or consolidation, either (i) each such constituent
    corporation shall

                                      B-2

    send a second notice before the effective date of the merger or
    consolidation notifying each of the holders of any class or series of stock
    of such constituent corporation that are entitled to appraisal rights of the
    effective date of the merger or consolidation or (ii) the surviving or
    resulting corporation shall send such a second notice to all such holders on
    or within 10 days after such effective date; provided, however, that if such
    second notice is sent more than 20 days following the sending of the first
    notice, such second notice need only be sent to each stockholder who is
    entitled to appraisal rights and who has demanded appraisal of such holder's
    shares in accordance with this subsection. An affidavit of the secretary or
    assistant secretary or of the transfer agent of the corporation that is
    required to give either notice that such notice has been given shall, in the
    absence of fraud, be prima facie evidence of the facts stated therein. For
    purposes of determining the stockholders entitled to receive either notice,
    each constituent corporation may fix, in advance, a record date that shall
    be not more than 10 days prior to the date the notice is given provided,
    that if the notice is given on or after the effective date of the merger or
    consolidation, the record date shall be such effective date. If no record
    date is fixed and the notice is given prior to the effective date, the
    record date shall be the close of business on the day next preceding the day
    on which the notice is given.

    (e) Within 120 days after the effective date of the merger or consolidation,
the surviving or resulting corporation or any stockholder who has complied with
subsections (a) and (d) hereof and who is otherwise entitled to appraisal
rights, may file a petition in the Court of Chancery demanding a determination
of the value of the stock of all such stockholders. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, at any time within 60 days after the effective date of the merger or
consolidation, any stockholder shall have the right to withdraw such
stockholder's demand for appraisal and to accept the terms offered upon the
merger or consolidation. Within 120 days after the effective date of the merger
or consolidation, any stockholder who has complied with the requirements of
subsections (a) and (d) hereof, upon written request, shall be entitled to
receive from the corporation surviving the merger or resulting from the
consolidation a statement setting forth the aggregate number of shares not voted
in favor of the merger or consolidation and with respect to which demands for
appraisal have been received and the aggregate number of holders of such shares.
Such written statement shall be mailed to the stockholder within 10 days after
such stockholder's written request for such a statement is received by the
surviving or resulting corporation or within 10 days after expiration of the
period for delivery of demands for appraisal under subsection (d) hereof,
whichever is later.

    (f)  Upon the filing of any such petition by a stockholder, service of a
copy thereof shall be made upon the surviving or resulting corporation, which
shall within 20 days after such service file in the office of the Register in
Chancery in which the petition was filed a duly verified list containing the
names and addresses of all stockholders who have demanded payment for their
shares and with whom agreements as to the value of their shares have not been
reached by the surviving or resulting corporation. If the petition shall be
filed by the surviving or resulting corporation, the petition shall be
accompanied by such a duly verified list. The Register in Chancery, if so
ordered by the Court, shall give notice of the time and place fixed for the
hearing of such petition by registered or certified mail to the surviving or
resulting corporation and to the stockholders shown on the list at the addresses
therein stated. Such notice shall also be given by 1 or more publications at
least 1 week before the day of the hearing, in a newspaper of general
circulation published in the City of Wilmington, Delaware or such publication as
the Court deems advisable. The forms of the notices by mail and by publication
shall be approved by the Court, and the costs thereof shall be borne by the
surviving or resulting corporation.

    (g) At the hearing on such petition, the Court shall determine the
stockholders who have complied with this section and who have become entitled to
appraisal rights. The Court may require the stockholders who have demanded an
appraisal for their shares and who hold stock represented by certificates to
submit their certificates of stock to the Register in Chancery for notation
thereon of

                                      B-3

the pendency of the appraisal proceedings; and if any stockholder fails to
comply with such direction, the Court may dismiss the proceedings as to such
stockholder.

    (h) After determining the stockholders entitled to an appraisal, the Court
shall appraise the shares, determining their fair value exclusive of any element
of value arising from the accomplishment or expectation of the merger or
consolidation, together with a fair rate of interest, if any, to be paid upon
the amount determined to be the fair value. In determining such fair value, the
Court shall take into account all relevant factors. In determining the fair rate
of interest, the Court may consider all relevant factors, including the rate of
interest which the surviving or resulting corporation would have had to pay to
borrow money during the pendency of the proceeding. Upon application by the
surviving or resulting corporation or by any stockholder entitled to participate
in the appraisal proceeding, the Court may, in its discretion, permit discovery
or other pretrial proceedings and may proceed to trial upon the appraisal prior
to the final determination of the stockholder entitled to an appraisal. Any
stockholder whose name appears on the list filed by the surviving or resulting
corporation pursuant to subsection (f) of this section and who has submitted
such stockholder's certificates of stock to the Register in Chancery, if such is
required, may participate fully in all proceedings until it is finally
determined that such stockholder is not entitled to appraisal rights under this
section.

    (i)  The Court shall direct the payment of the fair value of the shares,
together with interest, if any, by the surviving or resulting corporation to the
stockholders entitled thereto. Interest may be simple or compound, as the Court
may direct. Payment shall be so made to each such stockholder, in the case of
holders of uncertificated stock forthwith, and the case of holders of shares
represented by certificates upon the surrender to the corporation of the
certificates representing such stock. The Court's decree may be enforced as
other decrees in the Court of Chancery may be enforced, whether such surviving
or resulting corporation be a corporation of this State or of any state.

    (j)  The costs of the proceeding may be determined by the Court and taxed
upon the parties as the Court deems equitable in the circumstances. Upon
application of a stockholder, the Court may order all or a portion of the
expenses incurred by any stockholder in connection with the appraisal
proceeding, including, without limitation, reasonable attorney's fees and the
fees and expenses of experts, to be charged pro rata against the value of all
the shares entitled to an appraisal.

    (k) From and after the effective date of the merger or consolidation, no
stockholder who has demanded appraisal rights as provided in subsection (d) of
this section shall be entitled to vote such stock for any purpose or to receive
payment of dividends or other distributions on the stock (except dividends or
other distributions payable to stockholders of record at a date which is prior
to the effective date of the merger or consolidation); provided, however, that
if no petition for an appraisal shall be filed within the time provided in
subsection (e) of this section, or if such stockholder shall deliver to the
surviving or resulting corporation a written withdrawal of such stockholder's
demand for an appraisal and an acceptance of the merger or consolidation, either
within 60 days after the effective date of the merger or consolidation as
provided in subsection (e) of this section or thereafter with the written
approval of the corporation, then the right of such stockholder to an appraisal
shall cease. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no appraisal proceeding in the Court
of Chancery shall be dismissed as to any stockholder without the approval of the
Court, and such approval may be conditioned upon such terms as the Court deems
just.

    (l)  The shares of the surviving or resulting corporation to which the
shares of such objecting stockholders would have been converted had they
assented to the merger or consolidation shall have the status of authorized and
unissued shares of the surviving or resulting corporation.

                                                                         ANNEX C

The Board of Directors
Huntway Refining Company
25129 The Old Road, #322
Newhall, California 91381

Dear Sirs:

You have asked us to advise you with respect to the fairness to the stockholders
of Huntway Refining Company (the "Company") from a financial point of view of
the consideration to be received by such holders pursuant to the terms of the
Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of March 20, 2001 (the "Acquisition
Agreement"), by and among the Company, Valero Refining and Marketing Company
(the "Acquiror"), and HAC Company (the "Sub"). The Acquisition Agreement
provides for the merger (the "Merger") of the Sub with and into the Company,
pursuant to which the Company will become a wholly-owned subsidiary of the
Acquiror and (i) each outstanding share of common stock, par value $0.01 per
share, of the Company (the "Common Shares") will be converted into the right to
receive $1.90 in cash, and (ii) all Senior Subordinated Secured Convertible
Notes due 2007 of the Company (the "Convertible Notes") will be purchased at or
immediately prior to the closing of the Merger for cash in an aggregate amount
equal to the sum of (x) the amount that would have been payable in the Merger
for the Common Shares underlying such Convertible Notes had such Convertible
Notes been fully converted into Common Shares immediately prior to the closing
of the Merger and (y) any then accrued and unpaid interest on such Convertible
Notes, but not including any prepayment premium or penalty.

In arriving at our opinion, we have reviewed the Acquisition Agreement and
related documents and certain publicly available business and financial
information relating to the Company. We have also reviewed certain other
information, including financial forecasts and operating data, provided to us by
the Company, and met with the Company's management to discuss the business and
prospects of the Company.

We have also considered certain financial and stock market data of the Company
and we have compared that data with similar data for other publicly held
companies in businesses similar to those of the Company and we have considered
the financial terms of certain other business combinations which have recently
been effected. We have considered the liquidity characteristics of the Common
Shares including the size of the Company's public float on an absolute basis and

                               SIMMONS & COMPANY
                                 INTERNATIONAL

relative to the public float of comparable companies, and the historic daily
trading volume of the Common Shares. We also considered such other information,
financial studies, analyses and investigations and financial, economic and
market criteria that we deemed relevant.

In connection with our review, we have not independently verified any of the
foregoing information and have relied on its being complete and accurate in all
material respects. With respect to the financial forecasts, we have assumed that
they have been reasonably prepared on bases reflecting the best currently
available estimates and judgments of the Company's management as to the future
financial performance of the Company. In addition, we have not made an
independent evaluation or appraisal of the assets of the Company. In connection
with our engagement, we approached third parties to solicit indications of
interest in a possible acquisition of the Company and held preliminary
discussions with certain of these parties prior to the date of the Acquisition
Agreement.

Our opinion is necessarily based upon economic, monetary, political, regulatory,
market and other conditions as they exist and can be evaluated on, and on the
information made available to us as of, the date of this opinion.

Simmons & Company International ("Simmons") is a nationally recognized
investment banking firm and is continually engaged in the valuation of
businesses and their securities in connection with mergers and acquisitions,
leveraged buyouts, negotiated underwritings, secondary distributions of listed
and unlisted securities and private placements.

We have acted as financial advisor to the Board of Directors of the Company in
connection with the Merger and will receive a fee for our services, a
significant portion of which is contingent upon the consummation of the Merger.
We will also receive a fee for rendering this opinion.

Our opinion does not address the merits of the underlying decision by the
Company to engage in the Merger, and does not constitute a recommendation to any
holder of the Company's Common Shares as to how to vote on the approval and
adoption of the Acquisition Agreement or any matter related thereto.

It is understood that this letter is for the information of the Board of
Directors only as one element in the Board's consideration of the Merger and is
not to be quoted or referred to, in whole or in part, in any registration
statement, prospectus, or proxy statement, or in any other written document used
in connection with the offering or sale of securities, nor shall this letter be
used for any other purposes, without Simmons' prior written consent. However, we
understand and agree that this letter will be reprinted in its entirety and may
be summarized in the proxy statement delivered by the Company to holders of the
Common Shares and that we will have the opportunity to review and comment on all
descriptions thereof in such proxy statement prior to any dissemination to the
stockholders of the Company. We expressly disclaim any undertaking or obligation
to advise any person of any change in any fact or matter affecting, or which may
affect, this opinion of which we become aware after the date hereof.

                                      C-2

                                 INTERNATIONAL

Based upon and subject to the foregoing, it is our opinion that, as of the date
hereof, the $1.90 per share cash consideration to be received by the
stockholders of the Company is fair to such stockholders from a financial point
of view.

                                                       Very truly yours,
