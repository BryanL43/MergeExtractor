                   SUBJECT TO COMPLETION, DATED JUNE 29, 2001

                        JOINT PROXY STATEMENT-PROSPECTUS

        TO THE STOCKHOLDERS OF E-STAMP CORPORATION AND LEARN2.COM, INC.

                 MERGER PROPOSED -- YOUR VOTE IS VERY IMPORTANT

     The boards of directors of E-Stamp Corporation and Learn2.com, Inc. have
agreed to a merger pursuant to which Learn2 will merge with E-Stamp, with
E-Stamp continuing as the surviving company and changing its name to Learn2
Corporation.

     When the merger is completed, each share of Learn2 common stock will be
converted into the right to receive shares of E-Stamp common stock such that the
holders of E-Stamp common stock immediately prior to the merger will hold
approximately 50.1%, and the former holders of Learn2's common stock, including
the holder of Learn2's $10 million convertible debenture, will hold
approximately 49.9%, of the combined company. Assuming that the average closing
price of each company's common stock for the five consecutive days prior to the
special meetings of the companies is less than $1 per share and based on
E-Stamp's and Learn2's current capitalization, the exchange ratio would range
from approximately 0.457 to 0.485 of a share of E-Stamp common stock for each
share of Learn2 common stock. Based on the estimated exchange ratio range and
the current market prices of E-Stamp and Learn2, the per share dollar value
Learn2 stockholders will receive as a result of the merger would range from
approximately $0.096 to $0.102. In connection with merger, the fair value of the
assets to be acquired is approximately $33.3 million, and the fair value of the
liabilities to be assumed is approximately $6.2 million resulting in negative
goodwill of approximately $14.6 million.

     Learn2 common stock trades on the Nasdaq National Market under the symbol
"LTWO." On June 28, 2001, the closing price of Learn2 common stock was $0.19 per
share. E-Stamp common stock trades on the Nasdaq National Market under the
symbol "ESTM." On June 28, 2001, the closing price of E-Stamp common stock was
$0.21 per share. After the merger is completed, E-Stamp intends to apply to
change the symbol under which its common stock is traded to "LTWO."

     The boards of directors of both E-Stamp and Learn2 have unanimously
approved the merger and recommend that their respective stockholders vote FOR
the merger proposal. This joint proxy statement-prospectus provides you with
information regarding the merger. We strongly urge you to read and consider
carefully this document in its entirety.

     IN PARTICULAR, YOU SHOULD READ THE "RISK FACTORS" SECTION BEGINNING ON PAGE
17 FOR A DESCRIPTION OF THE VARIOUS RISKS YOU SHOULD CONSIDER IN EVALUATING THE
MERGER.

     Completion of the merger requires the approval of both the Learn2
stockholders and the E-Stamp stockholders. Both E-Stamp and Learn2 have
scheduled a special meeting of their stockholders to vote on these proposals.
Officers, directors and principal stockholders who hold in the aggregate
approximately 16.7% of Learn2's common stock and 19.7% of E-Stamp's common stock
have agreed to vote in favor of the merger agreement and the merger. The
foregoing percentages exclude shares of Learn2 and E-Stamp common stock issuable
to those persons upon exercise of stock options.

     In connection with the merger, Learn2 stockholders are also being asked to
approve the issuance of approximately 26.5 million shares, or approximately
33.34% of Learn2's common stock immediately prior to the completion of the
merger, to the holder of Learn2's $10 million convertible debenture, RGC
International Investors, LDC. These shares will be converted into 16.67% of the
aggregate issued and outstanding common stock of E-Stamp immediately following
completion of the merger. THE ISSUANCE OF SHARES OF LEARN2 COMMON STOCK TO THE
HOLDER OF LEARN2'S $10 MILLION CONVERTIBLE DEBENTURE WILL BE EFFECTIVE ONLY IF
THE MERGER IS COMPLETED, AND THE MERGER WILL BE COMPLETED ONLY IF THE ISSUANCE
OF SHARES TO THE HOLDER OF LEARN2'S $10 MILLION CONVERTIBLE DEBENTURE ALSO IS
APPROVED.

     The dates, times and places of the special meetings are as follows:

  E-STAMP STOCKHOLDER MEETING      LEARN2 STOCKHOLDER MEETING
                  , 2001                     , 2001
            , local time                  , local time

     Your vote is very important. Whether or not you expect to attend the

in the enclosed postage paid envelope so that your shares may be represented at

same effect as voting against the merger.

                             QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS
                                ABOUT THE MERGER

Q: WHAT IS THE MERGER?

A: E-Stamp will acquire Learn2 through a merger of E-Stamp and Learn2 into a
   single corporation. E-Stamp will be the surviving corporation in the merger.
   Pursuant to the merger, stockholders of Learn2, including RGC International
   Investors, LDC, the holder of Learn2's $10 million convertible debenture,
   will hold approximately 49.9% of the combined company, and stockholders of
   E-Stamp will hold approximately 50.1% of the combined company. Immediately
   following the completion of the merger, RGC will hold approximately 16.67% of
   the combined company.

Q: WHAT WILL LEARN2 STOCKHOLDERS RECEIVE AS A RESULT OF THE MERGER?

A: Learn2 stockholders will be entitled to receive, for each share of Learn2
   common stock they own, that number of shares of E-Stamp common stock equal to
   the quotient obtained by dividing (1) 99.5% of the number of outstanding
   shares of E-Stamp common stock by (2) the number of outstanding shares of
   Learn2 common stock. For purposes of this calculation, outstanding shares of
   both E-Stamp and Learn2 common stock shall include options that will be
   vested as of the closing of the merger and have an exercise price that is
   less than or equal to the average closing price of E-Stamp or Learn2 common
   stock, respectively, for the five consecutive trading days immediately
   preceding the E-Stamp or Learn2 special meeting, respectively.

    Based on an estimated 38.2 million shares of E-Stamp common stock and 79.4
    million shares of Learn2 common stock, which assumes the redemption of
    Learn2's $10 million convertible debenture in exchange for an estimated 26.5
    million shares of Learn2 common stock, outstanding immediately prior to the
    merger, the exchange ratio would be approximately 0.478. As a result,
    stockholders of Learn2 would receive approximately 0.478 of a share of
    E-Stamp common stock for each share of Learn2 common stock that they own.
    The exchange ratio will fluctuate based on, among other things, the number
    of shares issuable under vested stock options of E-Stamp and Learn2 with
    exercise prices equal to or less than the average closing price of each
    company's common stock for the five consecutive trading days immediately
    prior to the special meetings. Assuming that the average closing price of
    each company's common stock for the five consecutive trading days
    immediately prior to each company's special meeting is less than $1 per
    share and based on E-Stamp's and Learn2's current capitalization, we
    estimate that the exchange ratio would range from approximately 0.457 to
    0.485 of a share of E-Stamp common stock for each share of Learn2 common
    stock.

Q: HOW WILL E-STAMP'S PROPOSED REVERSE STOCK SPLIT AFFECT WHAT LEARN2
   STOCKHOLDERS RECEIVE AS A RESULT OF THE MERGER?

A: At E-Stamp's annual meeting of stockholders to be held on             , 2001,
   E-Stamp intends to submit to its stockholders a proposal to approve an
   amendment to its Certificate of Incorporation authorizing its board of
   directors to effect a reverse stock split of not less than 1-for-3 and not
   greater than 1-for-13. If E-Stamp's stockholders approve the foregoing
   proposal, the board of directors of E-Stamp will have the authority to
   implement any of the foregoing reverse stock splits without seeking further
   stockholder approval following the merger. If E-Stamp's board of directors
   implements a reverse stock split, shares of E-Stamp common stock received by
   Learn2 stockholders in the merger will automatically be combined and
   converted into the smaller number of shares required to implement the reverse
   stock split at the time of filing of the applicable amendment to E-Stamp's
   Certificate of Incorporation.

                                        vi

Q:WILL LEARN2 STOCKHOLDERS HAVE THE RIGHT TO VOTE ON E-STAMP'S PROPOSED REVERSE
  STOCK SPLIT?

A:No. E-Stamp's proposed reverse stock split will be submitted to E-Stamp
  stockholders at E-Stamp's annual meeting to be held on             , 2001. If
  approved by E-Stamp stockholders, no further stockholder approval by E-Stamp
  or Learn2 stockholders will be required.

Q: WHAT WILL E-STAMP STOCKHOLDERS RECEIVE AS A RESULT OF THE MERGER?

A: E-Stamp stockholders will continue to hold their existing E-Stamp common
   stock. E-Stamp stockholders immediately prior to the merger will hold
   approximately 50.1% of the combined company when the merger is completed.

Q: WHEN IS THE LEARN2 STOCKHOLDERS' SPECIAL MEETING RELATING TO THE MERGER, AND
   WHAT SPECIFIC PROPOSALS WILL I BE ASKED TO CONSIDER?

A: The Learn2 stockholders' special meeting will take place on             ,
   2001. At the special meeting, Learn2 stockholders will be asked to:

    - adopt the merger agreement and approve the merger of Learn2 with and into
      E-Stamp;

    - approve the issuance of approximately 26.5 million shares of Learn2 common
     stock to the holder of Learn2's $10 million convertible debenture;

    - approve an amendment of Learn2's Amended and Restated Certificate of
      Incorporation to effect a reverse stock split whereby Learn2 would issue
      one new share of common stock in exchange for not less than two shares nor
      more than ten shares of its outstanding common stock; and

    - elect five directors of Learn2 to serve until the earlier of the 2002
      annual meeting of stockholders or until their respective successors are
      elected and qualified.

   THE ISSUANCE OF SHARES OF LEARN2 COMMON STOCK TO THE HOLDER OF LEARN2'S $10
   MILLION CONVERTIBLE DEBENTURE WILL BE EFFECTIVE ONLY IF THE MERGER IS
   COMPLETED, AND THE MERGER WILL BE COMPLETED ONLY IF THE ISSUANCE OF SHARES TO
   THE HOLDER OF LEARN2'S $10 MILLION CONVERTIBLE DEBENTURE IS ALSO APPROVED.
   The reverse stock split and the election of directors would be effective only
   if the merger is not completed, and implementation of the reverse stock split
   would be in the discretion of the board of directors of Learn2.

Q: WHEN IS THE E-STAMP STOCKHOLDERS' SPECIAL MEETING RELATING TO THE MERGER, AND
   WHAT SPECIFIC PROPOSALS WILL I BE ASKED TO CONSIDER?

A: The E-Stamp stockholders' special meeting will take place on                ,
   2001. At the special meeting, E-Stamp stockholders will be asked to:

    - adopt the merger agreement and approve the merger of Learn2 with and into
      E-Stamp, which includes changing E-Stamp's name to "Learn2 Corporation";
      and

    - amend E-Stamp's 1999 Stock Plan to increase the number of shares reserved
      for issuance under the plan by 6,500,000.

Q: WHAT DO I NEED TO DO NOW?

A: After carefully reading and considering the information contained in this
   joint proxy statement-prospectus, please mail your signed proxy card in the
   enclosed return envelope as soon as possible, so that your shares may be
   represented at the special meeting.

                                       vii

Q: WHAT HAPPENS IF I DON'T VOTE?

    - If you fail to respond, it will have the same effect as a vote against the
      merger.

    - If you respond and do not indicate how you want to vote, your proxy will
      be counted as a vote in favor of the merger.

    - If you respond and abstain from voting, your proxy will have the same
      effect as a vote against the merger.

Q: CAN I CHANGE MY VOTE AFTER I HAVE MAILED MY SIGNED PROXY CARD?

A: Yes. You can change your vote at any time before your proxy is voted at the
   special meeting. You can do this in one of three ways:

    - you can send, via facsimile or U.S. mail, a written notice to the
      secretary of Learn2 or E-Stamp, as appropriate, stating that you would
      like to revoke your proxy;

    - you can complete and submit a new proxy card; or

    - you can attend the special meeting and vote in person.

    Your attendance at the meeting alone will not revoke your proxy. Only your
    vote at the meeting will revoke your proxy.

Q: IF MY BROKER HOLDS MY SHARES IN "STREET NAME," WILL MY BROKER VOTE MY SHARES
   FOR ME?

A: No. Your broker will not be able to vote your shares without instructions
   from you. If you do not provide your broker with voting instructions, your
   shares will be considered present at the special meeting for purposes of
   determining a quorum but will not be voted in favor of the merger. If you
   have instructed a broker to vote your shares, you must follow directions
   received from your broker to change those instructions.

Q: SHOULD I SEND IN MY STOCK CERTIFICATES NOW?

A: No. If you are a Learn2 stockholder, we will send you written instructions
   for exchanging your Learn2 stock certificates for E-Stamp stock certificates
   after the merger is completed. If you are an E-Stamp stockholder, you will
   retain your existing stock certificates after the merger.

Q: HOW DO LEARN2'S OFFICERS AND DIRECTORS PLAN TO VOTE ON THE MERGER?

A: Learn2's board of directors has unanimously approved the merger agreement and
   the merger and recommends that Learn2's stockholders approve the merger
   agreement and the merger. In addition, all of Learn2's executive officers and
   directors, who hold in the aggregate approximately 16.7% of Learn2's
   outstanding common stock have agreed to vote in favor of the merger agreement
   and the merger at the Learn2 special meeting. The foregoing percentage
   excludes shares of Learn2 or E-Stamp common stock issuable to those persons
   upon exercise of stock options.

Q: HOW DO E-STAMP'S OFFICERS AND DIRECTORS PLAN TO VOTE ON THE MERGER?

A: E-Stamp's board of directors has unanimously approved the merger agreement
   and the merger and recommends that E-Stamp's stockholders approve the merger
   agreement and the merger. In addition, all of E-Stamp's executive officers,
   including some former officers, directors and one of its principal
   stockholders, who hold in the aggregate approximately 19.7% of E-Stamp's
   outstanding common stock already have agreed to vote in favor of the merger
   agreement and the merger at the E-Stamp special meeting. The foregoing
   percentage excludes shares of E-Stamp common stock issuable to those persons
   upon exercise of stock options.

                                       viii

Q: WHEN CAN I SELL THE E-STAMP COMMON STOCK I RECEIVE IN THE MERGER?

A: The shares of E-Stamp common stock you receive in the merger will be freely
   transferable unless you are an "affiliate" of either E-Stamp or Learn2 or
   your shares are subject to any contractual restrictions on transfer.
   Generally, an "affiliate" is considered to be someone who is an executive
   officer or director of a company or someone who owns more than 5% of the
   outstanding stock of a company.

Q: WILL I RECEIVE FRACTIONAL SHARES AS A RESULT OF THE MERGER?

A: No. All fractional shares of E-Stamp common stock will be rounded to the
   nearest whole share.

Q: WHAT ARE THE TAX CONSEQUENCES TO STOCKHOLDERS OF THE MERGER?

A: The merger is intended to be treated as a tax-free reorganization for federal
   income tax purposes. If the merger qualifies as a reorganization, Learn2
   stockholders generally will not recognize gain or loss on the exchange of
   their stock in the merger. Tax matters, however, are very complicated and the
   tax consequences of the merger to you will depend on the facts of your
   particular situation. We encourage you to contact your tax advisors to
   determine the tax consequences of the merger to you.

Q: DO EITHER E-STAMP OR LEARN2 STOCKHOLDERS HAVE DISSENTERS' RIGHTS IN
   CONNECTION WITH THE MERGER?

A: No. Under Delaware law, neither E-Stamp nor Learn2 stockholders are entitled
   to dissenters' rights in connection with the merger.

Q: ARE RIGHTS AS AN E-STAMP STOCKHOLDER DIFFERENT THAN RIGHTS AS A LEARN2
   STOCKHOLDER?

A: Yes. At the time of the merger, stockholders of Learn2 will become
   stockholders of E-Stamp. There are important differences between the rights
   of stockholders of Learn2 and stockholders of E-Stamp. Please carefully
   review the description of these differences in the section entitled
   "Comparison of Rights of Holders of Learn2 Common Stock and E-Stamp Common
   Stock" in this joint proxy statement-prospectus.

Q: WHAT WILL HAPPEN TO EMPLOYEE STOCK OPTIONS HELD BY LEARN2 EMPLOYEES?

A: All outstanding options to purchase shares of Learn2 common stock, whether or
   not exercisable, will be assumed by E-Stamp and generally be subject to the
   same terms and conditions governing outstanding Learn2 options immediately
   prior to the completion of the merger, except that the number of shares
   E-Stamp common stock into which each outstanding Learn2 option will be
   exercisable and the exercise price will be adjusted appropriately to reflect
   the exchange ratio in the merger.

Q: MAY I EXERCISE STOCK OPTIONS BETWEEN NOW AND THE COMPLETION OF THE MERGER?

A: Yes. Any shares of Learn2 received by holders of Learn2 stock options as a
   result of the exercise of Learn2 stock options prior to completion of the
   merger will be exchanged in the merger.

Q: WHEN DO YOU EXPECT THE MERGER TO BE COMPLETED?

A: We are working toward completing the merger as quickly as possible. We hope
   to complete the merger in the third quarter of 2001.

Q: WHO WILL BE THE OFFICERS AND DIRECTORS OF E-STAMP FOLLOWING THE MERGER?

A: We have agreed that five of the nine directors of E-Stamp following the
   merger will be selected by the board of directors of E-Stamp, and four will
   be selected by Learn2. Robert H. Ewald, President and Chief Executive Officer
   of E-Stamp, will become the Chairman of the Board of E-Stamp following the
   merger. Donald Schupak will become the Chairman of the Executive Committee of
   the Board of E-Stamp. Stephen P. Gott, President and Chief Executive Officer
   of Learn2, will become the

                                        ix

   President and Chief Executive Officer of E-Stamp, and Marc E. Landy,
   Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Secretary of Learn2,
   will become the Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer, Secretary
   and Treasurer of E-Stamp. Messrs. Robert H. Ewald, Donald Schupak, Marcelo A.
   Gumucio, Robert J. Cresci, John V. Balen, James A. Cannavino, Stephen P.
   Gott, S. Lee Kling and Ms. Rebecca Saeger will be members of the board of
   directors of E-Stamp immediately following the merger.

Q: WHOM SHOULD I CALL WITH QUESTIONS?

A: Learn2 stockholders should call Learn2 investor relations at 914-682-4300
   with any questions about the merger. E-Stamp stockholders should call E-Stamp
   investor relations at 650-919-7500 with any questions about the merger.

THE MERGER (SEE PAGE 44)

     Structure of the Merger. At the closing of the merger, Learn2 will be
merged into E-Stamp and the separate corporate existence of Learn2 will cease.
E-Stamp will continue as the surviving corporation and will change its name to
Learn2 Corporation.

     What Learn2 Stockholders Will Receive. As of the closing of the merger, the
following will occur in accordance with the terms and conditions of the merger
agreement:

     - Each outstanding share of Learn2 common stock will be converted into the
       number of shares of E-Stamp common stock calculated pursuant to the
       exchange ratio, rounded to the nearest whole share. No fractional shares
       of E-Stamp common stock will be issued in the merger. The exchange ratio
       shall equal the quotient obtained by dividing (i) 99.5% of the number of
       outstanding shares of E-Stamp common stock by (ii) the number of
       outstanding shares of Learn2 common stock. For purposes of the exchange
       ratio, outstanding shares of both E-Stamp and Learn2 common stock,
       including shares issuable to Learn2's $10 million convertible debenture
       holder, shall include options that will be vested as of the closing of
       the merger and have an exercise price that is less than or equal to the
       average closing price of E-Stamp or Learn2 common stock, respectively,
       for the five consecutive trading days immediately preceding the E-Stamp
       or Learn2 special meeting, respectively.

     - All outstanding options, warrants and other rights to purchase Learn2
       common stock will be assumed by E-Stamp and will become options, warrants
       and other rights to purchase E-Stamp common stock. The exercise price and
       number of shares of E-Stamp common stock into which they are convertible
       will be adjusted based on the exchange ratio.

     What E-Stamp Stockholders Will Receive. E-Stamp stockholders will continue
to hold their existing E-Stamp common stock. E-Stamp stockholders immediately
prior to the merger will hold approximately 50.1% of the combined company.

     Value of the Assets, Liabilities and Goodwill. The fair value of the assets
to be acquired is approximately $33.3 million, and the fair value of the
liabilities to be assumed is approximately $6.2 million resulting in negative
goodwill of approximately $14.6 million.

BACKGROUND OF THE MERGER (SEE PAGE 44)

     The terms of the proposed merger were determined through arm's-length
negotiations between Learn2's and E-Stamp's respective board of directors.

     We encourage you to read the section entitled "The Merger -- Background of
the Merger" on pages 44 to 49 of this joint proxy statement-prospectus for a
discussion of how the consideration to be received by the stockholders of Learn2
was determined.

OVERVIEW OF THE MERGER AGREEMENT (SEE PAGE 68)

CONDUCT PRIOR TO THE MERGER

     Each of Learn2 and E-Stamp has agreed to operate its business in the
ordinary course and consistent with past practice prior to the merger, except
that E-Stamp has discontinued its business. In addition, each of Learn2 and
E-Stamp has agreed not to take specified actions without consent of the other
company. These actions include, among other things:

     - increasing the compensation or fringe benefits of any employees;

     - establishing, adopting or entering into any employee benefit plan or
      other similar arrangement;

     - declaring, setting aside or paying any dividends or other distributions;

     - issuing, delivering, awarding, granting or selling any shares of any
       class of capital stock;

     - incurring indebtedness exceeding $2 million in the aggregate;

     - acquiring or disposing, outside the ordinary course of business, of all
       or a significant portion of its assets or the assets of any business or
       corporation; and

     - making or changing any tax or accounting policy.

NO SOLICITATION OF OTHER OFFERS

     Each of Learn2 and E-Stamp has agreed, subject to limited exceptions, not
to initiate or engage in discussions with any other party regarding a business
combination unless and until the merger agreement is terminated.

CONDITIONS TO THE MERGER

     Each of E-Stamp's and Learn2's obligation to complete the merger is subject
to the satisfaction or waiver of specified conditions, including:

     - the adoption of the merger agreement by both the Learn2 and E-Stamp
       stockholders;

     - no law, injunction or order preventing the completion of the merger may
       be in effect;

     - our respective representations and warranties in the merger agreement
       must be true and correct in all material respects;

     - there shall have been no material adverse change in Learn2's or E-Stamp's
       business or operations;

     - the approval of the issuance of approximately 26.5 million shares of
      Learn2 common stock to the holder of Learn2's convertible debenture by
      Learn2 stockholders; and

     - E-Stamp must have at least $13 million in net cash at the closing, as
       determined in accordance with the merger agreement.

     Each of the conditions to E-Stamp's and Learn2's obligation to complete the
merger may be waived, in whole or in part, to the extent permitted by applicable
laws, by agreement of E-Stamp and Learn2. In the event a waiver is granted, the
boards of directors of E-Stamp and Learn2 will evaluate its materiality and
determine whether amendment of this joint proxy statement-prospectus and
resolicitation of stockholder approval is warranted. However, we generally do
not expect the granting of an individual waiver to be sufficiently material to
warrant amendment and resolicitation of the joint proxy statement-prospectus.
If, for example, E-Stamp failed to satisfy the closing condition related to its
minimum cash position and Learn2 waived said condition, E-Stamp and Learn2 may
determine that the failure of E-Stamp to satisfy that condition and its
subsequent waiver by Learn2 are not material. Stockholders will be notified of
any such waiver by a joint press release prior to the special meetings.

TERMINATION OF THE MERGER AGREEMENT

     The merger agreement may be terminated under certain circumstances,
including:

     - by mutual written consent of E-Stamp and Learn2;

     - by either E-Stamp or Learn2 if the other party materially breaches its
       representations, warranties or covenants contained in the merger
       agreement;

     - by either E-Stamp or Learn2 if the stockholders of the party do not
       approve and adopt the merger agreement and other proposals; or

     - if the merger is not consummated on or before September 30, 2001.

TERMINATION FEES

     The merger agreement provides that if either E-Stamp or Learn2 terminates
the merger agreement as a result of the other company (i) failing to obtain the
required vote of its stockholders or (ii) withdrawing or altering its approval
or recommendation of the merger agreement, then a termination fee of $500,000
will be due and payable to the other party.

REASONS FOR THE MERGER (SEE PAGES 49 AND 58)

   The boards of directors of E-Stamp and Learn2 believe that the merger will
   create a combined company which will have the potential of becoming the
   world's leading provider of engaging e-learning products and services by
   combining Learn2's business plan with E-Stamp's working capital and
   management. The boards of directors of E-Stamp and Learn2 also believe that
   the merger will create a combined company that will have the opportunity to:

    - enhance stockholder value for both E-Stamp and Learn2 stockholders;

    - increase revenue opportunities for the combined company;

    - introduce new tutorials and expand the Learn2 product offerings into new
     markets;

    - eliminate existing Learn2 indebtedness;

    - increase awareness of the Learn2 brand; and

    - attract and retain qualified employees and customers.

   The boards of directors of E-Stamp and Learn2 also considered potential
   detriments of the merger, including:

    - the dilution to both E-Stamp and Learn2 stockholders to their percentage
     ownership in the combined company;

    - the risk of diverting management resources from other strategic
     opportunities and operational matters for an extended period of time;

    - the possibility that the intended benefits of the merger may not be
     realized;

    - the possibility that the merger might not be completed and that under some
     circumstances a termination fee may need to be paid;

    - the substantial costs to be incurred in connection with the merger; and

    - the other various risks described in the "Risk Factors" section beginning
     on page 17 of this joint proxy statement-prospectus.

RECOMMENDATION OF THE BOARDS OF DIRECTORS AND OPINIONS OF FINANCIAL ADVISORS
(SEE PAGES 31, 41, 51 AND 59)

     To Learn2 stockholders: The board of directors of Learn2 has approved
unanimously the merger agreement and the merger and believes that the merger is
advisable and in the best interests of Learn2 and its stockholders. The Learn2
board, therefore, unanimously recommends that Learn2 stockholders vote FOR
approval of the merger and adoption of the merger agreement.

     To E-Stamp stockholders: The board of directors of E-Stamp has approved
unanimously the merger agreement and the merger and believes that the merger is
advisable and in the best interests of E-Stamp and its stockholders. The E-Stamp
board, therefore, unanimously recommends that E-Stamp stockholders vote FOR
approval of the merger and adoption of the merger agreement.

     Opinion of Learn2's Financial Advisor: In deciding to approve the merger,
the Learn2 board of directors considered the opinion of its financial advisor,
M. Kane & Company, Inc., that, as of the date of its opinion, and subject to and
based on the considerations referred to in its opinion, the merger is fair, from
a financial point of view, to Learn2's stockholders. The fairness opinion is not
a recommendation to any stockholder to approve the merger. The full text of this
opinion is attached as Annex VI to this joint proxy statement-prospectus. Learn2
urges its stockholders to read the opinion of MK&Co. in its entirety. Learn2 has
agreed to pay MK&Co. a fee equal, as of the date of its opinion, to $200,000
plus $15,000 per month thereafter until the completion of the merger or
termination of the merger agreement, or, if greater, 2.0625% of the merger
consideration. No portion of this fee is contingent upon the completion of the
merger. MK&Co. did not make or obtain any independent evaluations or appraisals
of the assets or liabilities of Learn2 in connection with preparing its fairness
opinion.

     Opinion of E-Stamp's Financial Advisor: In deciding to approve the merger,
the E-Stamp board of directors considered the opinion of its financial advisor,
Houlihan Lokey Howard & Zukin Financial Advisors, Inc., that, as of the date of
its opinion, and subject to and based on the considerations referred to in its
opinion, the ratio to exchange Learn2 common stock for E-Stamp common stock is
fair, from a financial point of view, to E-Stamp. The fairness opinion is not a
recommendation to any stockholder to approve the merger. The full text of this
opinion is attached as Annex V to this joint proxy statement-prospectus. E-Stamp
urges its stockholders to read the opinion of Houlihan Lokey in its entirety.
Houlihan Lokey has not received any independent appraisals in connection with
preparing its fairness opinion, but it has independently assessed the valuation
of E-Stamp and Learn2. E-Stamp has agreed to pay Houlihan Lokey $400,000 plus
expenses for rendering its fairness opinion. No portion of this fee is
contingent upon the completion of the merger.

CONFLICTS OF INTERESTS OF LEARN2 AND E-STAMP EXECUTIVE OFFICERS AND DIRECTORS IN
THE MERGER (SEE PAGE 63)

     Some of the executive officers and directors of Learn2 and E-Stamp will
receive benefits if the merger is completed which may result in those persons
having interests in the merger that are different from, or in addition to, your
interests. These conflicts of interest result from the benefits to be received
by those individuals as a result of or in connection with the merger.
Specifically, as a result of or in connection with the merger:

     - Donald Schupak will become Chairman of the Executive Committee of the

       Rebecca Saeger will continue as directors of E-Stamp after the merger;

     - Learn2 officers Stephen P. Gott and Marc E. Landy will become executive
       officers of E-Stamp;

     - Stock options issued to Stephen P. Gott and Marc E. Landy exercisable to

       at exercise prices ranging from $0.47 to $4.00 per share may become fully
       vested;

     - Learn2 directors and executive officers will have the right to continued
       indemnification and insurance coverage by E-Stamp for acts and omissions
       occurring prior to the merger;

     - Robert H. Ewald and Marcelo Gumucio will continue to receive salaries of
       approximately $290,000 and $120,000, respectively, after the merger;

     - The loans provided by E-Stamp to Robert H. Ewald and Marcelo Gumucio,
       having outstanding balances of approximately $290,000 and $90,000,
       respectively, will be forgiven in their entirety prior to the merger,
       together with a tax gross up on the forgiveness;

     - E-Stamp will pay Robert H. Ewald a cash bonus of $200,000 upon completion
       of the merger;

     - E-Stamp will pay Edward F. Malysz a cash bonus of $100,000 upon
      completion of the merger; and

     - Stock options exercised through the issuance of notes by Messrs. Schupak,

       average of $2.14, respectively, per share to $0.01, $0.71 and $0.67,
       respectively, per share and the notes issued by these directors in the
       principal amount of $1,194,000, $286,667 and $206,667, respectively, will
       be cancelled and any liens thereunder released.

RELATED AGREEMENTS (SEE PAGE 78 - 81, 128)

     Voting Agreements. Learn2 executive officers and directors who hold in the
aggregate approximately 16.7% of the outstanding shares of Learn2 common stock
have entered into voting agreements with E-Stamp. E-Stamp executive officers,
including some former officers, and directors and one of its principal
stockholders who hold in the aggregate approximately 19.7% of the outstanding
shares of E-Stamp common stock have entered into voting agreements with Learn2.
Under the voting agreements, these persons have agreed to vote in favor of
approval of the merger and adoption of the merger agreement. The foregoing
percentages exclude shares of Learn2 and E-Stamp common stock issuable to those
persons upon exercise of stock options.

     RGC Redemption and Termination Agreement. In connection with the merger,
Learn2, E-Stamp and RGC International Investors, LDC entered into an agreement
providing for the redemption and termination of a convertible debenture in the
aggregate principal amount of $10 million issued by Learn2 to RGC. Under the
agreement, Learn2's stockholders must approve the issuance to RGC of
approximately 26.5 million shares of common stock at the Learn2 special meeting
in order to redeem and terminate the debenture. The issuance of shares to RGC
will be effective only if the merger is completed, and the merger will be
completed only if the issuance of shares to RGC is approved. Immediately
following the completion of the merger, RGC will own approximately 16.67% of the
combined company.

     Lock-up Agreements. Pursuant to the redemption and termination agreement
described above, RGC has entered into, and E-Stamp and Learn2 each intend for
the persons who will serve as either executive officers or directors of E-Stamp
after the merger to enter into, lock-up agreements restricting those persons'
ability to dispose of E-Stamp common stock. The lock-up agreements will
generally prohibit any transfers of E-Stamp common stock before the merger and
for the first six months following the merger, and permit sales in only limited
circumstances during the following six months. RGC's lock-up agreement will be
effective only if each of the persons who will serve as either executive
officers or directors of E-Stamp after the merger enter into these lock-up
agreements. The lock-up agreements for executive officers or directors of
E-Stamp following the merger will terminate at such time as such person ceases
to

be an executive officer or director of E-Stamp, except for Messrs. Gott and
Schupak whose lock-up obligations will not terminate should they cease to be
officers or directors of E-Stamp following the merger.

     The Private Placement. Pursuant to the merger agreement, E-Stamp loaned
Learn2 $2 million on April 25, 2001 in exchange for Learn2's issuance to E-Stamp
of a $2 million convertible promissory note. The note is due and payable by
Learn2 on April 30, 2002. The maturity date of the note will automatically
accelerate if Learn2 becomes the subject of any bankruptcy, insolvency,
receivership or similar proceeding. In addition, E-Stamp may declare the note
immediately due and payable if:

     - Learn2 breaches its obligations under the note;

     - a default occurs with respect to Learn2's $10 million convertible
      debenture that results in the acceleration of the due date of the $10
      million convertible debenture;

     - Learn2's board withdraws, modifies or changes its recommendation with
      respect to the merger in a manner adverse to E-Stamp or recommends a
      different acquisition proposal; or

     - Learn2 executes an agreement relating to an acquisition proposal with a
      person other than E-Stamp.

     If E-Stamp terminates the merger agreement as a result of Learn2's breach
of the merger agreement that results in a material adverse effect on Learn2 and
that breach cannot be or has not been cured within 15 days after the giving of
written notice by E-Stamp to Learn2, E-Stamp may declare the note due and
payable sixty days following the termination of the merger agreement.

     The note is convertible by E-Stamp at any time into 2,000 shares of Series
E preferred stock of Learn2. These 2,000 shares of Learn2 Series E preferred
stock are initially convertible into an aggregate of 8,000,000 shares of Learn2
common stock, subject to adjustment of the conversion ratio under specified
circumstances, at any time following the termination of the merger agreement.
The Learn2 Series E preferred stock is not convertible into shares of Learn2
common stock prior to the termination of the merger agreement. As a result, the
common stock conversion feature will only be relevant if the merger agreement is
terminated, whether as a result of failure to obtain stockholder approval or
otherwise. Upon completion of the merger, the note will be cancelled without
consideration.

MATERIAL FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSIDERATIONS (SEE PAGE 64)

     The merger is intended to qualify as a reorganization under Section 368(a)
of the Internal Revenue Code. If the merger so qualifies, generally no gain or
loss will be recognized by the holders of shares of Learn2 stock on the exchange
of their shares of Learn2 common stock for shares of E-Stamp common stock. All
Learn2 stockholders should read carefully the discussion in the "The
Merger -- Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger" section
of this joint proxy statement-prospectus. FURTHER, ALL LEARN2 STOCKHOLDERS ARE
URGED TO CONSULT THEIR OWN TAX ADVISORS AS TO THE TAX CONSEQUENCES OF THE MERGER
TO THEM.

ACCOUNTING TREATMENT (SEE PAGE 66)

     We intend to account for the merger under the purchase method of accounting
for business combinations. E-Stamp will be treated as the accounting acquirer in
the merger.

COMPLETION AND EFFECTIVENESS OF THE MERGER

     We will complete the merger when all of the conditions to completion of the
merger have been satisfied or waived in accordance with the merger agreement.
The merger will become effective when we file a certificate of merger with the
State of Delaware. We intend to complete the merger during the third quarter of
2001.

(1) Effective January 1, 2000, Learn2 adopted SAB No. 101. Learn2's adoption of
    SAB No. 101 resulted in a change in method of accounting for cooperative
    advertising expenses. In accordance with previously existing accounting
    principles, Learn2 recorded cooperative advertising expenses as a sales and
    marketing expense. During 2000, as a result of new interpretations of
    generally accepted accounting principles by the Securities and Exchange
    Commission through the issuance of SAB No. 101, Learn2 was required to
    change the accounting policy for cooperative advertising to record these
    expenses as a reduction of gross revenues. The adjustment for the year ended
    December 31, 1999 decreased both net revenues and sales and marketing
    expenses of approximately $1.3 million. The adjustment for the three months
    ended March 31, 2000 decreased net revenues and sales and marketing expenses
    of approximately $1.0 million. There was no restatement for the years ended
    December 31, 1998, 1997 and 1996.

SUMMARY UNAUDITED PRO FORMA COMBINED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL DATA

     The following summary unaudited pro forma combined condensed consolidated
financial data of E-Stamp which gives effect to the merger as a purchase
transaction, is derived from the unaudited pro forma combined consolidated
financial statements included elsewhere in this joint proxy statement-
prospectus. The pro forma combined condensed consolidated statement of
operations data for the three months ended March 31, 2001 and for the year ended
December 31, 2000 is presented as if the merger was completed on January 1, 2001
and 2000, respectively and E-Stamp issued approximately 38 million shares of
E-Stamp common stock in the merger. The pro forma combined condensed
consolidated balance sheet data is presented as if the merger was completed on
March 31, 2001. You should read it in conjunction with the unaudited pro forma
combined condensed consolidated financial statements and the separate audited
supplemental financial statements of E-Stamp and Learn2 included in this joint
proxy statement-prospectus. See "Unaudited Pro Forma Combined Condensed
Consolidated Financial Statements" on page 84.

     The unaudited pro forma combined condensed consolidated financial
statements are presented in this joint proxy statement-prospectus for

(1) Net loss per share is determined by dividing net loss by weighted average
    shares outstanding.

(2) The tangible book value per share is computed by dividing stockholders'
    equity less intangible assets by the number of weighted average shares of
    common stock outstanding. The E-Stamp pro forma combined book value per
    share is computed by dividing pro forma stockholders' equity less intangible
    assets by the pro forma number of shares of E-Stamp common stock outstanding
    as of March 31, 2001 and December 31, 2000 assuming the merger had occurred
    on January 1, 2000.

(3)The Learn2 equivalent pro forma combined per share amounts are calculated by
   multiplying the E-Stamp pro forma combined per share amounts by the exchange
   ratio of 0.478.

MARKET PRICE INFORMATION

     E-Stamp common stock is traded on the Nasdaq National Market under the
symbol "ESTM." Learn2 common stock is traded on the Nasdaq National Market under
the symbol "LTWO."

     The following table sets forth the closing prices per share of E-Stamp
common stock as reported on the Nasdaq National Market and the closing prices
per share of Learn2 common stock as reported on the Nasdaq National Market on
(1) April 19, 2001, the last full trading day preceding public announcement that
E-Stamp and Learn2 had entered into the merger agreement and (2)             ,
2001, the last full trading day for which it was practicable to obtain closing
prices at the time of the printing of this joint proxy statement-prospectus.

        , 2001..................................

     The following table includes the equivalent price per share of Learn2
common stock assuming that the merger had occurred on April 19, 2001. The
equivalent per share price reflects the value of E-Stamp common stock that would
be received by a Learn2 stockholder for each share of Learn2 common stock
applying the exchange ratio in the merger agreement to the market price of
E-Stamp common stock on that date. The table includes total outstanding shares
of E-Stamp common stock and Learn2 common stock as adjusted for vested stock
options and warrants with exercise prices equal to or less than the average
closing price of the respective company's common stock for the five consecutive
trading days immediately prior to that date. The total outstanding shares of
Learn2 common stock has also been adjusted to include an estimated 26,457,067
shares of Learn2 common stock issuable upon the redemption of Learn2's $10
million convertible debenture.

                                                                                                   EQUIVALENT PRICE

     Because the market price of E-Stamp common stock may increase or decrease
before the completion of the merger, Learn2 stockholders are urged to obtain
current market quotations. In addition, Learn2 stockholders may receive less
than or more than 0.4783 of a share of E-Stamp common stock for each share of
Learn2 common stock depending on the number of shares of E-Stamp common stock
and Learn2 common stock outstanding immediately prior to the merger and the
number of shares of E-Stamp common stock and Learn2 common stock issuable under
vested options and warrants with exercise prices equal to or less than the
average closing price of the respective company's common stock during the
five-day measurement period immediately prior to the special meetings.

LISTING ON THE NASDAQ NATIONAL MARKET

     On November 9, 2000, E-Stamp received a notice from The Nasdaq Stock Market
that its common stock had failed to maintain a minimum bid price of $1.00 over
the previous 30 consecutive trading days as required for continued listing on
The Nasdaq National Market. On March 23, 2001, E-Stamp attended a hearing before
the Nasdaq Qualifications Hearing Panel to determine if its common stock should
continue to be listed on The Nasdaq National Market, and E-Stamp has continued
to correspond with officials at Nasdaq since its hearing. On April 23, 2001 the
Nasdaq Listing Qualification Panel notified E-Stamp it would continue listing
E-Stamp's common stock on The Nasdaq National Market pursuant to an exception
that requires E-Stamp's completion of specified milestones by specified dates.
These milestones include completion of the merger by July 23, 2001 and
compliance with all of The Nasdaq National Market listing requirements after the
closing. In the event that E-Stamp or the combined company fail to meet Nasdaq's
conditions the exception may be revoked. In addition, the exception is

subject to the further review and modification or reversal by the Nasdaq Listing
and Hearing Review Council. If E-Stamp's common stock is delisted from The
Nasdaq National Market, its liquidity and trading price could be impacted
negatively.

     At E-Stamp's annual meeting of stockholders to be held on           , 2001,
E-Stamp intends to submit to its stockholders a proposal to authorize its board
of directors to implement a reverse stock split for the purpose of complying
with the Nasdaq National Market's minimum per share bid price requirements. If
approved by E-Stamp stockholders, E-Stamp's board of directors will have the
authority to implement the reverse stock split without seeking further
stockholder approval by E-Stamp or Learn2 stockholders.

     The Nasdaq Stock Market has advised Learn2 that its bid price was below
$1.00 per share, the minimum per share bid price required under marketplace Rule
4450(a)(5) to maintain a Nasdaq National Market listing. Learn2 has requested an
exception to Marketplace Rule 4450(a)(5) of the Nasdaq National Market, pending
the completion of the merger or, if necessary, the reverse stock split. The
principal reasons for the reverse stock split are to benefit from the
marketability and liquidity of Learn2's common stock from its listing on the
Nasdaq National Market. On June 1, 2001, representatives of Learn2 attended a
hearing before the Nasdaq Qualifications Hearing Panel to determine if its
common stock should continue to be listed on the Nasdaq National Market. Learn2
has not yet been notified by the Nasdaq Listing Qualifications Panel of its
determination as a result of that hearing. If Learn2's common stock is delisted
from the Nasdaq National Market, its liquidity and trading price could be
negatively affected.

RECENT DEVELOPMENTS

     On April 20, 2001 E-Stamp announced that it was in the process of
discontinuing its transportation management solutions business. In May 2001,
E-Stamp completed the discontinuation of its transportation management business.

     In April 2001, E-Stamp sold all of its patents and patent applications and
certain trademarks and domain names related to its Internet postage business to
Stamps.com, Inc. for cash proceeds of $7.5 million. E-Stamp will record a gain
of approximately $7.5 million related to this transaction in the three months
ending June 30, 2001.

     On June 14, 2001, E-Stamp announced that it had sold its Digital Shipper
and e-Receive products, maintenance and support contracts and trademarks to Data
Track Technologies of California, Inc. Under the agreement, Data Track assumed
all of E-Stamp's maintenance and warranty obligations to its customers.

     On June 18, 2001, E-Stamp entered into an agreement with Pitney Bowes, Inc.
to settle all litigation between the companies. The litigation, which included
claims of infringement of Pitney Bowes patents and antitrust counterclaims by
E-Stamp, was resolved without admission of liability. E-Stamp paid $2 million to
Pitney Bowes in connection with the settlement, and expects to recover insurance
proceeds of approximately $1.8 million.

                                  RISK FACTORS

     You should consider carefully the risks described below before making your
decision to approve the merger. These factors should be considered in
conjunction with the other information contained in this joint proxy
statement-prospectus, the annexes and the exhibits.

     If any of the events, contingencies, circumstances or conditions described
in the following risks actually occur, the business, financial condition or
results of operations of E-Stamp and Learn2 could be harmed.

RISKS RELATED TO THE MERGER

DECREASES IN THE TRADING PRICE OF E-STAMP'S COMMON STOCK WILL REDUCE THE VALUE
OF WHAT LEARN2 STOCKHOLDERS RECEIVE IN THE MERGER.

     Upon completion of the merger, shares of Learn2 capital stock will be
converted into shares of E-Stamp capital stock. Any change in the price of
either Learn2 common stock or E-Stamp common stock will affect the value Learn2
stockholders receive in the merger. The market values of Learn2's common stock
and E-Stamp's common stock have experienced significant volatility, and the
value of the shares of E-Stamp common stock to be received in the merger will go
up or down as the market price of E-Stamp common stock goes up or down. Stock
price changes may result from a variety of factors that are beyond the control
of Learn2 and E-Stamp. Neither party is permitted to "walk away" from the merger
or resolicit the vote of its stockholders solely because of changes in the
market price of either party's common stock.

     The prices of Learn2 common stock and E-Stamp common stock at the closing
of the merger may vary from their respective prices on the date of this joint
proxy statement-prospectus and on the date of the special meetings. Because the
date the merger is completed may be later than the date of the special meetings,
the prices of Learn2's common stock and E-Stamp's common stock on the date of
the special meetings may not be indicative of their respective prices on the
date the merger is completed.

LEARN2 AND E-STAMP MAY NOT REALIZE THE INTENDED BENEFITS OF THE MERGER.

     Learn2 and E-Stamp believe that the merger will provide many benefits to
the combined company. Combining the two companies may, however, be complex, time
consuming and expensive. In addition, the combined company will have a board of
directors comprised of directors from both companies, and management comprised
principally of executive officers from Learn2. There can be no assurance that
Learn2 and E-Stamp will be able to combine their businesses effectively, that
the board of directors and management will be able to work together to
effectively manage the combined company or that the combined company will
realize the benefits of the merger. The failure to realize these benefits could
adversely affect the combined company's business.

LEARN2 AND E-STAMP MAY LOSE THEIR LISTINGS ON THE NASDAQ NATIONAL MARKET,
WHETHER OR NOT MERGER IS COMPLETED

     The Nasdaq National Market advised Learn2 on January 16, 2001 and April 17,
2001 that its bid price was below $1.00 per share, the minimum per share bid
price required under marketplace Rule 4450(a)(5) to maintain a listing. Learn2's
common stock has traded below $1.00 per share since December 2000. On June 1,
2001, representatives of Learn2 attended a hearing before the Nasdaq
Qualifications Hearing panel to determine if its common stock should continue to
be listed on the Nasdaq National Market. Learn2 has not yet been notified by the
Nasdaq Listing Qualifications Panel of its determination as a result of that
hearing.

     The Nasdaq National Market advised E-Stamp on November 9, 2000 that its bid
price was below $1.00 per share. E-Stamp's common stock has traded below $1.00
per share since September 28, 2000. On March 23, 2001, E-Stamp attended a
hearing before the Nasdaq Qualifications Hearing Panel to determine if its
common stock should continue to be listed on The Nasdaq National Market and
E-Stamp

has continued to correspond with officials at Nasdaq since its hearing. On April
23, 2001, the Nasdaq Listing Qualification Panel notified E-Stamp that it would
continue listing E-Stamp's common stock on The Nasdaq National Market pursuant
to an exception that requires the E-Stamp's completion of specified milestones
by specified dates. These milestones include completion of the merger with
Learn2 by July 23, 2001 and compliance with all of the Nasdaq National Market
listing requirements after the closing. In the event that the merger is not
completed by July 23, 2001, E-Stamp's common stock will be delisted from the
Nasdaq National Market unless E-Stamp is able to obtain an extension or waiver
of this milestone from the Nasdaq Listing Qualifications Panel. Granting of any
such extension or waiver would be in the discretion of the Nasdaq Listing
Qualifications Panel, and the panel could refuse our request for an extension or
waiver.

E-STAMP'S REVERSE STOCK SPLIT MAY NOT RESULT IN AN INCREASE IN THE PER SHARE
PRICE OF E-STAMP'S COMMON STOCK; THERE ARE OTHER RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH THE
REVERSE STOCK SPLIT.

     E-Stamp cannot predict whether its proposed reverse stock split of not less
than 1-for-3 and not greater than 1-for-13 shares will increase the market price
for E-Stamp's common stock. E-Stamp and Learn2 stockholders may be impacted
adversely as a result of the reverse stock split. The history of similar reverse
stock splits for companies in like circumstances is varied. Among other things:

     - The market price per new share of E-Stamp common stock after the reverse
      stock split may not rise in proportion to the reduction in the number of
      old shares of E-Stamp common stock outstanding before the reverse stock
      split; and

     - The reverse stock split may not result in a per share price that will
      either exceed or remain in excess of the $1.00 minimum bid price as
      required by Nasdaq or E-Stamp may not otherwise meet the requirements of
      Nasdaq for continued inclusion for trading on Nasdaq.

     The market price of E-Stamp's common stock will also be based on E-Stamp's
performance and other factors, some of which are unrelated to the number of
shares outstanding. If the reverse stock split is effected and the market price
of E-Stamp's common stock declines, the percentage decline as an absolute number
and as a percentage of E-Stamp's overall market capitalization may be greater
than would occur in the absence of a reverse stock split. Such a decline would
impact Learn2 stockholders by decreasing both the aggregate number and the
aggregate value of the E-Stamp shares they will receive in the merger.
Furthermore, liquidity of E-Stamp's common stock could be adversely affected by
the reduced number of shares that would be outstanding after the reverse stock
split.

LEARN2 OR, IF THE MERGER IS COMPLETED, E-STAMP IS OBLIGATED TO REGISTER THE
SHARES ISSUABLE TO LEARN2'S CONVERTIBLE DEBENTURE HOLDER.

     Learn2's convertible debenture holder has registration rights pursuant to
which Learn2 or, if the merger is completed, E-Stamp is obligated to file a
registration statement covering the shares issuable to it as a result of
conversion or termination of the debenture. As a result, approximately 12.7
million shares representing approximately 16.67% of the combined company's
common stock will become eligible for sale in the public market after completion
of the merger, subject to certain contractual restrictions on resale described
on page 128. If the merger is not completed, Learn2 will be obligated to
register for resale approximately 33.1 million shares representing 38.5% of
Learn2's common stock.

IF THE CONDITIONS TO THE MERGER ARE NOT MET OR WAIVED, THE MERGER WILL NOT
OCCUR.

     Specified conditions must be satisfied or waived to complete the merger.
These conditions, including a description of those subject to waiver, are
described in detail in the section entitled "The Merger Agreement -- Conditions
to Completion of the Merger" on page 76 of this joint proxy statement-
prospectus. E-Stamp and Learn2 cannot assure you that each of the conditions
will be satisfied. If the conditions are not satisfied or waived, the merger
will not occur or will be delayed, and the intended benefits of the merger may
not occur. In particular, if E-Stamp does not have net cash, as determined in

accordance with the merger agreement, of at least $13 million as of the closing
of the merger, Learn2 is not required to close.

LEARN2 AND E-STAMP MAY WAIVE ONE OR MORE OF THE CONDITIONS TO THE MERGER WITHOUT
RESOLICITING STOCKHOLDER APPROVAL FOR THE MERGER.

     Each of the conditions to E-Stamp's and Learn2's obligation to complete the
merger may be waived, in whole or in part, to the extent permitted by applicable
laws, by agreement of E-Stamp and Learn2. The boards of directors of E-Stamp and
Learn2 will evaluate the materiality of any such waiver to determine whether
amendment of this joint proxy statement-prospectus and resolicitation of proxies
is warranted. However, we generally do not expect any such waiver to be
sufficiently material to warrant resolicitation of stockholders. In the event
the boards of Learn2 and E-Stamp determine any such waiver is not sufficiently
material to warrant resolicitation of stockholders, Learn2 and E-Stamp will have
the discretion to complete the merger without seeking further stockholder
approval. For example, Learn2 could agree to complete the merger even if
E-Stamp's net cash, as determined in accordance with the merger agreement, is
below $13 million at closing.

THE MERGER MAY RESULT IN A LOSS OF OUR EMPLOYEES.

     Despite our efforts to hire and retain quality officers and employees, we
might lose officers and employees following the merger. Competition for
qualified management, sales, engineering and technical employees is intense.
Some employees of Learn2 hold options that will vest as a result of the merger,
and this may affect our ability to retain these officers and employees. In
addition, competitors may recruit officers and employees prior to the merger. As
a result, employees could leave with little or no prior notice. We cannot assure
you that the combined company will be able to attract, retain and integrate
officers and employees following the merger.

E-STAMP'S AUDITORS HAVE EXPRESSED SUBSTANTIAL DOUBT AS TO E-STAMP'S ABILITY TO
CONTINUE AS A GOING CONCERN FOR LACK OF CURRENT BUSINESS OPERATIONS.

     Based on the fact that E-Stamp has discontinued all of its current business
operations, E-Stamp's auditors have expressed substantial doubt as to E-Stamp's
ability to continue as a going concern. E-Stamp intends to continue and grow
Learn2's business as a means of generating revenue after completion of the
merger. E-Stamp does not currently have a plan to generate revenue if the merger
is not completed. E-Stamp may not be able to successfully devise and implement a
new business plan capable of generating sufficient revenues to support E-Stamp
as a going concern if the merger is not completed.

FAILURE TO COMPLETE THE PROPOSED MERGER COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT EACH OF E-STAMP'S
AND LEARN2'S STOCK PRICE AND FUTURE BUSINESS AND OPERATIONS.

     The merger is subject to the approval of E-Stamp's and Learn2's
stockholders and specified closing conditions. In the event that the merger is
not successfully completed, E-Stamp and Learn2 each may be subject to a number
of material risks, including the following:

     - the price of E-Stamp's and Learn2's common stock may decline to the
       extent that the current market price for its common stock reflects a
       market assumption that the proposed merger will be completed; and

     - costs related to the proposed merger, such as legal, accounting, and
       financial advisory fees, must be paid by E-Stamp and Learn2, even if the
       merger is not completed.

     In addition, in the event that the merger is not completed: the E-Stamp
board of directors may not be able to secure a similar strategic transaction to
provide E-Stamp with a continuing business, and the Learn2 board of directors
may not be able to secure a similar strategic transaction to provide Learn2 with
cash for working capital and other purposes.

IF THE MERGER IS NOT COMPLETED, WE MAY NOT HAVE SUFFICIENT CASH TO CONTINUE OUR
BUSINESS.

     If the merger is not completed and an event of default occurs under
Learn2's $10 million convertible debenture or the $2 million convertible
promissory note issued to E-Stamp by Learn2, Learn2 would not have sufficient
cash to fund operations and repay these obligations. The amount of the shortfall
could exceed $12 million and is dependent upon a variety of factors, including
the timely introduction and market success of its products, the costs of
developing, producing and marketing these products, adoption of the Internet as
a medium of commerce and delivery of services, general economic conditions and
various other factors. If Learn2's board of directors withdraws, modifies or
changes its recommendation with respect to the merger in a manner adverse to
E-Stamp or upon other events of default described on pages 7 and 79, E-Stamp may
declare the note immediately due and payable. In addition, under certain
circumstances, including the delisting of Learn2's common stock from the Nasdaq
National Market could be an event of default under the debenture.

THE MERGER WILL RESULT IN SUBSTANTIAL COSTS WHETHER OR NOT COMPLETED.

     The merger will result in significant costs to E-Stamp and Learn2.
Transaction costs are estimated at approximately $5.0 million. These costs are
expected to consist primarily of fees for investment bankers, attorneys,
accountants, filing fees and financial printers. All of these costs will be
incurred whether or not the merger is completed. In addition to these costs, if
the merger is completed E-Stamp has agreed to pay RGC $1 million as part of the
redemption of Learn2's $10 million debenture upon completion of the merger.

E-STAMP'S PRO FORMA ACCOUNTING FOR THE ACQUISITION OF LEARN2 MAY CHANGE.

     E-Stamp has allocated the total estimated purchase price for the
acquisition of Learn2 on a preliminary basis to assets and liabilities based on
E-Stamp's best estimate of the fair values of these assets and liabilities, with
the excess of the fair value of net assets acquired over the purchase
consideration treated as a reduction of goodwill, other intangible assets and
fixed assets of Learn2. This allocation is subject to change pending a final
analysis of the fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed. The
impact of these changes could be material to E-Stamp's future results of
operations.

LEARN2'S REVERSE STOCK SPLIT MAY NOT RESULT IN AN INCREASE IN THE PER SHARE
PRICE OF LEARN2'S COMMON STOCK; THERE ARE OTHER RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH THE
REVERSE STOCK SPLIT.

     Learn2 cannot predict whether its proposed reverse stock split of not less
than 1-for-2 and not greater than 1-for-10 shares will increase the market price
of Learn2's common stock. Learn2 stockholders may be impacted adversely as a
result of the reverse stock split. The history of similar stock split
combinations for companies in like circumstances is varied. Among other things:

     - The market price per new share of Learn2 common stock after the reverse
      stock split may not rise in proportion to the reduction in the number of
      old shares of Learn2 common stock outstanding before the reverse stock
      split; and

     - The reverse stock split may not result in a per share price that will
      either exceed or remain in excess of the $1.00 minimum bid price as
      required by Nasdaq or Learn2 may not otherwise meet the requirements of
      Nasdaq for continued inclusion for trading on Nasdaq.

     The market price of Learn2's common stock will also be based on Learn2's
performance and other factors, some of which are unrelated to the number of
shares outstanding. If the reverse stock split is effected and the market price
of Learn2's common stock declines, the percentage decline as an absolute number
and as a percentage of Learn2's overall market capitalization may be greater
than would occur in the absence of a reverse stock split. Furthermore, liquidity
of Learn2's common stock could be adversely affected by the reduced number of
shares that would be outstanding after the reverse stock split.

RISKS RELATED TO THE COMBINED COMPANY FOLLOWING THE MERGER

WE MAY LOSE OUR LISTING ON THE NASDAQ NATIONAL MARKET WHICH COULD RESULT IN YOUR
BEING UNABLE TO SELL OUR STOCK READILY OR AT ALL

     If our securities are delisted from the Nasdaq National Market, the
liquidity of our securities may be impacted adversely, not only in the number of
shares which could be bought or sold, but also through delays in the timing of
transactions and reductions in potential security analyst and media coverage.
This may reduce the demand for our common stock and the trading price of our
securities. A delisting would greatly impair our ability to raise additional
working capital.

     If our securities are delisted from the Nasdaq National Market, our common
stock may be eligible to trade on the OTC Bulletin Board. In that event, our
common stock may become subject to regulation as a "penny stock." The SEC has
adopted regulations which generally define "penny stock" to be any equity
security that has a market price or exercise price of less than $5.00 per share,
subject to certain exceptions, including listing on the Nasdaq National Market
or the Nasdaq SmallCap Market. For transactions covered by these rules,
broker-dealers must make a special suitability determination for the purchase of
such securities and must have received the purchaser's written consent to the
transaction prior to the purchase. Additionally, for any transaction involving a
penny stock, unless exempt, the rules require the delivery, prior to the
transaction, of a risk disclosure document mandated by the SEC relating to the
penny stock market. The broker-dealer is also subject to additional sales
practice requirements. Consequently, the penny stock rules may restrict the
ability of broker-dealers to sell our securities and may affect the ability of
holders to sell these securities in the secondary market and the price at which
such holders can sell any such securities.

     If we were to reapply to list our securities on Nasdaq following any
delisting, we might reapply for listing on The Nasdaq Small Cap Market rather
than The Nasdaq National Market. Compared to securities listed on The Nasdaq
National Market, securities listed on The Nasdaq Small Cap Market are not quoted
in regional newspapers, are less likely to receive analyst coverage and are less
likely to be invested in by institutional investors. In addition, securities
traded on The Nasdaq Small Cap Market are not exempt from state securities laws.

WE HAVE A HISTORY OF LOSSES AND AN ACCUMULATED DEFICIT; WE MAY CONTINUE TO
EXPERIENCE LOSSES.

     For the year ended December 31, 2000, Learn2 incurred a net operating loss
of approximately $38 million and for the three months ended March 31, 2001,
incurred a net loss of approximately $11 million. Learn2 had an accumulated
deficit of approximately $175 million at March 31, 2001. For the year ended
December 31, 2000, E-Stamp incurred a net loss of approximately $113 million and
for the three months ended March 31, 2001, incurred a net loss of approximately
$14 million. E-Stamp had an accumulated deficit of approximately $203 million at
March 31, 2001. We expect to continue to incur losses before depreciation and
amortization charges for the foreseeable future. In addition, in connection with
the acquisition of Learn2, we will incur significant accounting charges. These
losses will be substantial, and we may not ever become profitable.

WE MAY NEED TO RAISE ADDITIONAL FUNDS

     When the merger is completed, we believe we will have sufficient resources
for operating requirements and sufficient resources to realize the combined
company's business plan for at least the next twelve months to continue
operations. The completion of the merger is expected to enhance the combined
company's ability to finance its growth as cash flow and capital markets access
of the combined company may be greater than prior to the merger. To date, both
E-Stamp and Learn2 continue to use cash and operate at a loss. The combined
company's ability to achieve positive cash flow depends upon a variety of
factors, including the timely introduction and market success of our products,
the costs of developing, producing and marketing these products, adoption of the
Internet as a medium of commerce and delivery of services, general economic
conditions and various other factors, some of which may be beyond our control.
In addition, we may raise additional funds to develop, acquire and/or market
products, businesses

or technologies. These funds may be raised through joint ventures, the sale of
assets, the incurrence of debt, or the issuance of securities. If additional
funds are raised through the issuance of equity or convertible securities, the
percentage ownership of stockholders in the combined company will be reduced.
Also, these securities may have rights, preferences or privileges senior to the
combined company's common stock. However, it is possible that additional
financing may not be available on terms favorable to us, or at all. If adequate
funds are not available or are not available on acceptable terms, we may not be
able to realize our business plan.

WE MAY EXPERIENCE SIGNIFICANT FLUCTUATIONS IN REVENUES AND OPERATING RESULTS,
WHICH COULD CAUSE OUR SHARE PRICE TO BE VOLATILE.

     Due to the emerging nature of the e-learning market and a sluggish economy,
we may be unable to forecast our revenues and profitability accurately. Because
many of our costs will be fixed and based on anticipated revenue levels,
variations in, and the timing of, revenue recognition could cause significant
variations in operating results from quarter to quarter. If our future operating
results are below the expectations of investors, the trading price of the
combined company's common stock is likely to fall.

IF WE ARE UNABLE TO DEVELOP AWARENESS OF THE LEARN2 BRAND, OUR CUSTOMER BASE MAY
NOT GROW AS EXPECTED.

     Developing the Learn2 brand within our target markets is critical to
achieving widespread acceptance of our tutorials and a broad customer base. We
may not succeed in developing the Learn2 brand if more successful competitors
emerge, we are unable or fail to devote sufficient resources to marketing
efforts, or course performance problems cause customer dissatisfaction. Our
inability to develop the Learn2 brand would hinder growth.

WE WILL OPERATE IN A RAPIDLY CHANGING, COMPETITIVE MARKET AND WE MAY NOT HAVE
ADEQUATE RESOURCES TO COMPETE SUCCESSFULLY.

     The e-learning market is evolving quickly and is subject to rapid
technological change, shifts in customer demands and evolving industry
standards. To succeed, we must continue to expand tutorial offerings and upgrade
technologies. We may not be able to do so successfully. If we fail to anticipate
or respond adequately to changes in technology and customer preferences, or we
have any significant delays in tutorial development or introduction, our
competitors may be able to attract and maintain a greater customer base.

     The e-learning market is characterized by significant price competition. We
may face increasing price pressures from competitors, as customers demand more
value for their budgets. This could result in reduced operating margins, as well
as loss of market share and brand recognition.

     Although the e-learning market is highly fragmented with no single
competitor accounting for a dominant market share, competition is intense. Our
competitors vary in size and in the scope and breadth of the tutorials and
services they offer. Several of our competitors have longer operating histories
and significantly greater financial, technical and marketing resources. The lack
of significant entry barriers to the e-learning market will allow other
competitors to enter the market, increasing competition.

OUR BUSINESS WILL SUFFER IF E-LEARNING IS NOT WIDELY ACCEPTED.

     The market for e-learning products and services is new and evolving. We
expect that we will engage in intensive marketing and sales efforts to enable
prospective customers to learn about the benefits of our products and services.
There are a number of factors that could impact the acceptance of our products
and services, which are new and largely untested compared to more established
training and educational methods, including:

     - companies that have historically relied on, or invested in, traditional
       training and educational methods may be reluctant or slow to adopt
       Web-based e-learning products and services;

     - many of our potential customers have allocated only a limited portion of
       their budgets to e-learning; and

     - end users may not use e-learning products effectively.

     If the market for e-learning fails to develop or develops more slowly than
we expect, we will not achieve our growth and revenue targets and the value of
the combined company's common stock will likely decline.

THE SUCCESSFUL OPERATION OF OUR BUSINESS DEPENDS UPON A CONTINUAL SUPPLY OF
CONTENT OTHER THAN RELATED TO LEARN2'S CURRENT LIBRARY.

     Our business success is dependent upon our ability to develop or obtain
content from third party content providers because this content broadens the
variety of content subjects we offer. Our inability to develop our own content
or obtain it from third parties could result in delays in product introductions
or shipments. We will depend on the quality and reliability of the content
licensed and timely delivery of this content by our sources. Although we will
have agreements specifying the terms of the licenses, these agreements may not
be enforceable. We believe that we can arrange alternate sources for some or all
of our content, but our inability to provide content to our customers and
prospects on a timely basis could adversely affect the performance of our
business. In 2000, our revenue related to third party content was less than 10%
of our total revenue. The subject matter of Learn2's third party content can be
important to prospective customers that evaluate e-learning companies based on a
variety of content subjects.

WE MUST DELIVER TUTORIALS THAT MEET THE NEEDS OF OUR CUSTOMERS OR OUR BUSINESS
WILL SUFFER.

     To be competitive, we must develop and introduce on a timely basis new
tutorial offerings that meet the needs of companies seeking to use our
e-learning products. Furthermore, the viability of our e-learning products
depends in large part on our ability to update our tutorials and develop new
content as the underlying subject matter changes.

WE PLAN TO EXPAND THE SCOPE OF LEARN2'S TUTORIALS AND MAY DEPEND ON OUR ABILITY
TO ATTRACT EXPERTS OR SPECIALISTS. IF WE ARE UNABLE TO ATTRACT THE NECESSARY
EXPERTISE, WE WILL NOT BE ABLE TO ENTER NEW FIELDS.

     Our strategy involves broadening the fields presently covered by Learn2's
tutorials. In particular, to date Learn2 has focused primarily on tutorials in
the information technology area and we are planning to develop and introduce new
tutorial offerings in other fields. These new tutorial offerings may encompass
areas in which we have little or no experience or expertise. Therefore, our
ability to expand our tutorials into these areas may require us to locate and
evaluate third-party experts or specialists who would develop or assist us in
developing the tutorial content. If we are unable to locate and evaluate these
experts, we may fail to develop the tutorials our customers demand or be unable
to pursue new market opportunities. If we do not extend our tutorial offerings
into new fields, our revenue growth could be constrained.

THE VARIABILITY AND LENGTH OF OUR SALES CYCLE FOR OUR E-LEARNING PRODUCTS MAY
MAKE OUR OPERATING RESULTS UNPREDICTABLE AND VOLATILE.

     The period between our initial contact with a potential customer and the
first purchase of our product by that customer typically ranges from three to
nine months and in some cases may be as long as two years. Because we will rely
on large sales for a substantial portion of our revenues, these long sales
cycles can have a particularly significant effect on our financial performance
in any quarter. Factors which may contribute to the variability and length of
our sales cycle include:

     - The time required for potential customers to learn about the benefits of
       our e-learning products and services.

     - The time it takes our potential customers to assess the value of
       e-learning solutions compared to more traditional products and services.

     - The time it takes our potential customers to evaluate competitive
       e-learning products and services.

     - Our potential customers' internal budget and approval processes.

     - The extended periods most large corporations and government entities
       require to make purchasing decisions.

     As a result of our lengthy sales cycle, we have only a limited ability to
forecast the timing and size of specific sales and thus to predict quarterly
financial performance.

WE DEPEND ON MAJOR RETAILERS TO MARKET OUR PRODUCTS.

     In 2000, approximately 42.3% of our sales were made directly or indirectly
to retailers. This market is subject to the unpredictability of consumer demand.
We may not plan effectively for this market, which could result in adverse
operating results in future periods. Our retail customers also carry our
competitors' products and they may not continue to provide shelf space for our
products. These retail distributors may have limited capital to invest in
inventory. Their decisions to purchase our products are partly a function of
pricing, terms and special promotions offered by our competitors and other
factors that we do not control nor can we predict. Our agreements with retailers
are generally nonexclusive and may be terminated by them or by us without cause.

     Some retailers and distributors have experienced financial difficulties in
the past. Distributors that we currently use may experience financial
difficulties in the future. If these distributors do experience financial
difficulties and we are unable to move their inventories to other distributors,
we may experience reduced sales or increased write-offs, which would adversely
affect our operating results.

OUR PRODUCTS ARE DESIGNED FOR MICROSOFT TECHNOLOGIES.

     Our products are designed primarily for Microsoft technologies. We believe
that Microsoft technologies are and will continue to be, widely utilized by our
customers. However, if these customers do not actually adopt and continue to
utilize these technologies as anticipated or in the future migrate to other
computing technologies that we do not support, we may have to spend significant
capital and other resources including personnel to adapt our products to these
alternative technologies. Learn2's streaming technology does not function in a
Linux environment.

THE DEVELOPMENT OF LEARN2'S AUTHORING, COMPRESSION, ANIMATION AND STREAMING
TECHNOLOGIES IS COMPLEX.

     The development of Learn2's authoring, compression, animation and streaming
technologies is complex. The period between our initial development to the
release of our products typically ranges This can result in lengthy development
cycles, extended testing periods and undetected errors or bugs in the software
programs. As a result, the period between our initial development and testing to
the release of our products typically ranges from two to three months. These
factors can result in loss of market acceptance, loss of reputation and loss of
market share if products of competitors either are available on the market
first, or are viewed as more reliable than our products. To date, we have not
experienced undetected errors that have adversely and materially affected
operations.

OUR FUTURE GROWTH DEPENDS ON OUR ABILITY TO RETAIN KEY PERSONNEL AND SUCCESSFUL
HIRING AND RETENTION, PARTICULARLY WITH RESPECT TO SALES, MARKETING AND
DEVELOPMENT PERSONNEL, AND WE MAY BE UNABLE TO HIRE AND RETAIN THE SKILLED
PERSONNEL WE NEED TO SUCCEED.

     The combined company will be substantially dependent on Robert H. Ewald,
Chairman of the Board, Donald Schupak, Chairman of the Executive Committee, and
Stephen P. Gott, President, Chief Executive Officer and Director. We may not be
able to retain our key executives and engineers. We expect to continue to hire
additional staff. We may not be successful in attracting, retaining or
motivating key personnel. If we do not succeed in attracting new personnel, or
retaining and motivating existing personnel, our business may be affected
adversely.

WE FACE A RISK OF SYSTEM FAILURE.

     Our operations depend to a significant extent on our ability to maintain
our computer and telecommunications systems. We must also protect our systems
against damage from fire, natural disaster, power loss, telecommunications
failure or similar events. In addition, growth of our customer base may strain
the capacity of our computer operations center and telecommunications systems
and/or lead to degradations in performance or system failure. Any damage to or
loss of our computer and telecommunications networks including our operations
center could affect adversely the performance of our business. To date, we have
not experienced system failures that have adversely and materially affected
operations.

UNAUTHORIZED BREAK-INS TO OUR SERVICE COULD HARM OUR BUSINESS.

     Our servers are vulnerable to computer viruses, physical or electronic
break-ins and similar disruptions, which could lead to interruptions, delays,
loss of data or the inability to complete customer transactions. In addition,
unauthorized persons may improperly access our data, which could harm us.
Actions like these may be very expensive to remedy and could damage our
reputation and discourage new and existing users from purchasing our products
and services. To date, we have not experienced an unauthorized break-in or
similar disruption that has adversely and materially affected operations.

WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO IMPLEMENT OUR GROWTH STRATEGY.

     Successfully achieving our growth plan depends on our ability to:

     - Continue to develop and market our products and services.

     - Maintain and increase our customer base.

     - Effectively integrate businesses and technologies.

     - Continue to identify, attract, retain and motivate qualified personnel.

     If we do not successfully implement our growth strategy, our results of
operations will be adversely affected.

WE MAY BE SUBJECT TO INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY INFRINGEMENT CLAIMS, WHICH ARE COSTLY
TO DEFEND AND COULD LIMIT OUR ABILITY TO USE CERTAIN TECHNOLOGIES IN THE FUTURE.

     Many parties are developing and improving technologies which compete with
our proprietary technologies and patents. We believe that these parties will
continue to take steps to protect these technologies, including seeking patent
protection. As a result, disputes regarding the ownership of these technologies
could arise in the future.

     Third parties may assert claims against us alleging infringement of
patents, copyrights, trademark rights, trade secret rights or other proprietary
rights or alleging unfair competition. In the event that we determine that
licensing patents or other proprietary rights is appropriate, we may not be able
to license proprietary rights on reasonable terms or at all. As the number of
products in our target markets increase and the functionality of these products
further overlap, we may become subject to infringement claims. We may incur
substantial expenses in defending against third-party infringement claims
regardless of the merit of those claims. In the event that there is a
determination that we have infringed third-party proprietary rights, we could
incur substantial monetary liability and be prevented from using the rights in
the future.

OUR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS ARE COSTLY AND DIFFICULT TO PROTECT.

     We have patents that cover our StreamMaker and LearningAgent technologies
and have a patent pending for our AP tracking technologies. We cannot assure you
that patents issued or acquired by our company now or in the future will be
valid and enforceable, or provide us with any meaningful protection.

     We also have rights in the trademarks that we use to market our e-learning
services and products. These trademarks include Learn2.com, StreamMaker(TM),
LearningAgent(TM) and Learn2University(TM).

     Our intellectual property allows us to develop engaging, multimedia,
technology-based tutorials and courses. For a description of our intellectual
property see the section entitled "Learn2 Business" beginning on page 110.

     Our success and ability to compete effectively will depend, in part, on our
ability to protect our intellectual property, which we protect through a
combination of patent, trade secret, copyright, trademark, nondisclosure
agreements and other contractual provisions and technical measures.

     None of these protections may be adequate to prevent our competitors from
copying or reverse-engineering our products, concepts, trade names and trade
dress. Furthermore, none of these protections prohibit our competitors from
independently developing technologies that are substantially equivalent or
superior to our technologies.

     We license certain products under licenses that are not signed by our
licensees. The licensee agrees to the license by either (i) opening a package on
which the license is written or (ii) on a computer, "clicking" the "I accept" or
"I agree" tab underneath the license. These types of licenses may be
unenforceable under the laws of certain jurisdictions. In addition, the laws of
certain countries in which our products are or may be licensed do not protect us
to the same extent as the laws of the United States.

WE MAY BE UNABLE TO PROTECT OUR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS AND WE MAY BE
LIABLE FOR INFRINGING THE INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS OF OTHERS.

     Third parties may infringe or misappropriate our patents, trademarks or
other proprietary rights, which could have a material adverse effect on our
business, results of operations or financial condition. While we enter into
confidentiality agreements with many of our employees, consultants and strategic
partners and generally control access to and distribution of our proprietary
information, the steps we have taken to protect our proprietary rights may not
prevent misappropriation. We also attempt to register our trademarks and service
marks. However, we may not receive approval on all of our trademark
registrations or patent applications. Even if they are approved, such trademarks
or patents may be challenged by others or invalidated. In addition, we do not
know whether we will be able to defend our proprietary rights because the
validity, enforceability and scope of protection of proprietary rights in
Internet-related industries is uncertain and still evolving.

     Third parties may assert infringement claims against us. From time to time
in the ordinary course of business we have been and we expect to continue to be,
subject to claims alleging infringement of the intellectual property rights of
third parties. These claims and any resulting litigation, if it occurs, could
subject us to significant liability for damages. In addition, even if we
prevail, litigation could be time-consuming and expensive and could result in
the diversion of our time and attention. Any claims from third parties may also
result in limitations on our ability to use the intellectual property subject to
these claims unless we are able to enter into agreements with the third parties
making these claims.

CHANGES IN LAWS RELATING TO DATA COLLECTION AND USE PRACTICES AND THE PRIVACY OF
INTERNET USERS AND OTHER INDIVIDUALS COULD HARM OUR BUSINESS.

     Websites usually place certain information called "cookies" on a user's
hard drive usually without the user's knowledge or consent. Websites use cookies
for a variety of reasons. We employ the use of cookies on our Websites. Certain
Internet browsers allow users to modify their browser settings to remove cookies
at any time or to prevent cookies from being stored on their hard drive. In
addition, some Internet commentators, privacy advocates and governmental bodies
have suggested limiting or eliminating the use of cookies. The effectiveness of
our technology and products could be limited by any reduction or limitation in
the use of cookies. Specifically, some of our products use information provided
by cookies to, among other things, (i) help track the progress of users through
a tutorial, (ii) remember a user's login/password and (iii) track other session
information. The reduction or limitation in the use of cookies

may result in the loss of this session information, which could require the user
to either re-enter the information and/or increase the response time of a
tutorial. This could result in delays and a decrease in the effectiveness of our
products. In this regard, there are a large number of legislative proposals
before the United States Congress, foreign governments and other international
regulatory agencies regarding privacy issues and the regulation and use of
cookies. It is not possible to predict whether or when such legislation may be
adopted, and certain proposals, if adopted, could adversely affect our business.
This could be caused by, among other possible provisions, the requirement that
permission be obtained before we use cookies.

WE MAY BE EXPOSED TO PRODUCT LIABILITY CLAIMS.

     Learn2's license agreements with customers typically contain provisions
designed to limit exposure to potential product liability claims. It is
possible, however, that the limitation of liability provisions contained in the
license agreements may not be effective under the laws of certain state and
foreign jurisdictions.

WE FACE LEGAL UNCERTAINTIES RELATING TO THE INTERNET IN GENERAL AND TO OUR
INDUSTRY IN PARTICULAR AND MAY BECOME SUBJECT TO COSTLY GOVERNMENT REGULATION.

     The applicability to the Internet of existing laws is uncertain and
developing with regard to many issues, including sales tax, intellectual
property ownership and infringement, copyright, trademark, trade secret,
obscenity, libel, export of encryption technology and personal privacy.

     There are an increasing number of laws and regulations pertaining to
liability for information received from or transmitted over the Internet, online
content regulation, user privacy, taxation and quality of products and services.
In addition, it is possible that more laws and regulations may be adopted with
respect to the Internet, such as laws or regulations relating to user privacy,
taxation, e-mail, pricing, Internet access, content, copyrights, distribution
and characteristics and quality of products and services. Various state statutes
govern private post-secondary educational institutions. We are uncertain whether
states will attempt to apply these statutes to regulate the offering of
tutorials over the Internet.

     Changes in existing laws and the adoption of additional laws or regulations
may decrease the popularity or limit expansion of the Internet. A decline in the
growth of the Internet could decrease demand for our tutorials and services and
increase our cost of doing business.

OUR BUSINESS COULD BE HARMED BY CONSUMERS' CONCERNS ABOUT THE SECURITY OF
TRANSACTIONS OVER THE INTERNET.

     We believe that concerns regarding the security of confidential information
transmitted over the Internet, such as credit card numbers, prevent many
potential customers from engaging in online transactions. Our success may depend
on our ability to add sufficient security features to our e-commerce engine and
to instill confidence in those features in our customers. If we fail to do so,
we may not realize our business plan.

WE WILL CONTINUE TO EXPAND INTO INTERNATIONAL MARKETS IN WHICH WE HAVE LIMITED
EXPERIENCE.

     A part of our strategy is to develop international markets. Learn2 entered
into distribution or reseller arrangements in Africa, Brazil, Ireland, South
Korea, New Zealand and the United Kingdom. We may not be able to market our
products and services in foreign markets successfully.

     We have limited experience in developing localized versions of our products
and marketing our products and services internationally. We rely on the efforts
and abilities of our international business partners in those activities.

     In addition to uncertainty about our ability to continue to generate
revenues and expand our international presence, we face certain risks inherent
in doing business internationally, including:

     - Local economic and market conditions.

     - Difficulties in enforcing intellectual property and contractual rights.

     - The need for compliance with a variety of international and United States
       export regulations.

     - Unexpected changes in regulatory requirements.

     - Trade barriers.

     - Difficulties in staffing and managing international operations because of
       distance, language and cultural differences.

     - Longer payment cycles.

     - Currency exchange rate fluctuations.

     - Problems in collecting accounts receivable.

     - Political and economic instability.

     - Seasonal fluctuations in business activity.

     - Potentially adverse tax consequences.

     One or more of these factors could have a material adverse effect on our
future international presence and, consequently, on our business, operating
results and financial condition.

E-STAMP MAY INCUR ADDITIONAL LIABILITIES AND EXPENSES IN CONNECTION WITH THE
PHASE OUT OF ITS BUSINESS.

     E-Stamp has discontinued its business of providing transportation
management software products. E-Stamp may incur additional liabilities and
expenses in connection with the discontinuation of its transportation management
business, including liabilities and expenses arising from the termination of
existing contracts and other commitments, that could have a material adverse
effect upon E-Stamp's financial condition and results of operations. Costs and
expenses directly related to the discontinuance of E-Stamp's Digital Shipper
business will include charges associated with the write-down of fixed assets,
rent and other facilities-related expenses, costs associated with terminating
contractual arrangements, employee termination costs and legal, accounting and
consulting fees. E-Stamp estimates that these costs and expenses will range from
approximately $4.2 million to $4.4 million for the three months ended June 30,
2001 and approximately $1.1 million to $4.2 million for the following twelve
month period. The estimate of these costs and expenses is a forward looking
statement that is subject to risks and uncertainties. E-Stamp expects that the
proceeds derived from the sale of its assets, including its intellectual
property, will exceed the costs of discontinuing its operations.

OTHER EVENTS COULD RESULT IN A DILUTION OF YOUR OWNERSHIP OF OUR COMMON STOCK.

     We will have approximately 75.3 million shares of common stock outstanding
and approximately           million shares of common stock equivalents including
warrants and stock options following the merger. If we issue additional equity
securities, you may experience dilution, and the new equity securities may have
rights, preferences or privileges senior to those of existing holders of our
common stock. In addition, if we continue to acquire new companies through the
issuance of common or preferred stock your percentage of ownership may be
diluted.

                FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS MAY PROVE INACCURATE

     This joint proxy statement-prospectus contains "forward-looking statements"
within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and
Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. These statements
relate to expectations concerning matters that are not historical facts. Words
such as "projects," "believes," "anticipates," "plans," "expects," "intends,"
and similar words and expressions are intended to identify forward-looking
statements. Although each of E-Stamp and

Learn2 believes that such forward-looking statements are reasonable, neither can
assure you that such expectations will prove to have been correct. Important
factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from such
expectations are disclosed herein including, without limitation, in the "Risk
Factors" section beginning on page 17. All forward-looking statements are
expressly qualified in their entirety by these factors and all related
cautionary statements.

                     LEARN2 SPECIAL MEETING OF STOCKHOLDERS

DATE, TIME AND PLACE OF MEETING

     The special meeting of the stockholders of Learn2 will be held at
          located at                , on        , 2001, at      , local time.

PURPOSE OF THE SPECIAL MEETING

     At the special meeting, Learn2 stockholders will consider and vote upon the
following proposals:

     - To adopt a merger agreement between E-Stamp and Learn2, pursuant to which
       E-Stamp will merge with Learn2, and E-Stamp will be the surviving
       corporation;

     - To approve the issuance of approximately 26.5 million shares of Learn2
       common stock to the holder of Learn2's $10 million convertible debenture;

     - To approve an amendment of Learn2's Amended and Restated Certificate of
       Incorporation to effect a reverse stock split whereby Learn2 would issue
       one new share of common stock in exchange for not less than two nor more
       than ten shares of outstanding common stock;

     - To elect five directors of Learn2 to serve until the earlier of the 2002
       annual meeting of stockholders or until their respective successors are
       elected and qualified; and

     - To transact such other business as may come before the meeting or at any
       postponements or adjournments of the meeting.

     THE ISSUANCE OF SHARES OF LEARN2 COMMON STOCK TO THE HOLDER OF LEARN2'S $10
MILLION CONVERTIBLE DEBENTURES WILL BE EFFECTIVE ONLY IF THE MERGER IS
COMPLETED, AND THE MERGER WILL BE COMPLETED ONLY IF THE ISSUANCE OF SHARES TO
THE HOLDERS OF LEARN2'S $10 MILLION CONVERTIBLE DEBENTURE IS ALSO APPROVED. THE
REVERSE STOCK SPLIT AND THE ELECTION OF DIRECTORS WOULD BE EFFECTIVE ONLY IF THE
MERGER IS NOT COMPLETED.

     YOUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS HAS UNANIMOUSLY APPROVED THE MERGER AGREEMENT, THE
ISSUANCE OF LEARN2 COMMON STOCK, THE REVERSE STOCK SPLIT AND THE NOMINEES FOR
DIRECTOR. YOUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS RECOMMENDS A VOTE "FOR" THE ADOPTION OF THE
MERGER AGREEMENT, THE ISSUANCE OF LEARN2 COMMON STOCK, THE REVERSE STOCK SPLIT
AND THE NOMINEES FOR DIRECTOR.

RECORD DATE; VOTING RIGHTS; PROXIES

     Only holders of Learn2 capital stock at the close of business on
               , 2001, the record date, are entitled to notice of and to vote at
the special meeting. As             , 2001, there were                shares of
Learn2 common stock issued and outstanding. The accompanying form of proxy is
for use at the special meeting. All shares of Learn2 common stock represented by
properly executed proxies will, unless such proxies have been previously
revoked, be voted in accordance with the instructions indicated in such proxies.
IF NO INSTRUCTIONS ARE INDICATED, SHARES OF LEARN2 COMMON STOCK REPRESENTED BY
SUCH PROXIES WILL BE VOTED "FOR" ADOPTION OF THE MERGER AGREEMENT, THE ISSUANCE
OF LEARN2 COMMON STOCK, THE REVERSE STOCK SPLIT AND THE NOMINEES FOR DIRECTORS.
Learn2 does not know of any matters other than as described in the notice of
special meeting of stockholders that are to come before the special meeting. If
any other matter is properly presented for action at the special meeting, the
persons named in the enclosed form of proxy will have the discretion to vote on
such matters in accordance with their best judgment.

     A stockholder who has given a proxy may revoke it at any time prior to its
exercise by giving written notice, via facsimile or U.S. mail, to the Secretary
of Learn2, by signing and returning a later-dated proxy, or by voting in person
at the special meeting. However, mere attendance at the special meeting will not
in

and of itself have the effect of revoking the proxy. Votes cast by proxy or in
person at the special meeting will be tabulated by the inspector of election
appointed for the special meeting.

SOLICITATION OF PROXIES

     Proxies are being solicited by and on behalf of the Learn2 board of
directors. Learn2 has engaged the firm of MacKenzie Partners, Inc. as proxy
solicitors and expects to pay approximately $12,000 plus reimbursement for out
of pocket expenses. Learn2 and E-Stamp will share equally in the expenses
incurred in connection with the printing and mailing of this joint proxy
statement-prospectus. Proxies may also be solicited by directors, officers and
employees of Learn2 in person or by telephone or other means of communication.
Such directors, officers and employees will not be compensated additionally for,
but may be reimbursed by Learn2 for out-of-pocket expenses incurred in
connection with, such solicitation. Although there is no formal agreement to do
so, arrangements also may be made with brokerage firms, banks, custodians,
nominees and fiduciaries for the forwarding of proxy and solicitation materials
to owners of Learn2 common stock held of record by such persons, and these firms
may be reimbursed for reasonable expenses incurred in forwarding the proxy and
solicitation materials.

QUORUM; ABSTENTIONS; BROKER NON-VOTES

     The presence in person or by properly executed proxy of holders of a
majority of all the issued and outstanding shares of Learn2 common stock
entitled to vote is necessary to constitute a quorum at the special meeting. For
purposes of determining whether a quorum is present, the inspector of election
will include shares that are present or represented by proxy, even if the
holders of such shares abstain from voting on any particular matter. In the
event that a broker, bank, custodian, nominee or other record holder of Learn2
common stock indicates on a proxy that it does not have discretionary authority
to vote certain shares on a particular proposal -- known as a broker
non-vote -- those shares will not be considered for purposes of determining the
number of shares entitled to vote with respect to a particular proposal on which
the broker has expressly not voted, but will be counted for purposes of
determining the presence or absence of a quorum for the transaction of business.
Accordingly, abstentions and broker non-votes will have the effect of a "no"
vote on the proposal to adopt the merger agreement but will not affect the
outcome of the voting on proposals that requires a majority of the shares
present or represented by proxy at the special meeting.

LEARN2 PROPOSAL NO. 1: THE MERGER AND RELATED TRANSACTIONS

     At the special meeting, the Learn2 stockholders are being asked to adopt a
merger agreement between E-Stamp and Learn2 pursuant to which E-Stamp will merge
with Learn2, and E-Stamp will be the surviving corporation. The merger will be
completed only if the issuance of shares of Learn2 common stock to the holder of
Learn2's $10 million convertible debenture discussed below is also approved.

REQUIRED VOTE

     Approval of the merger and adoption of the merger agreement requires the
affirmative vote of holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of Learn2
common stock.

     As of the record date, directors and executive officers who hold in the
aggregate approximately 16.7% of Learn2's outstanding common stock have agreed
to vote in favor of the merger agreement and the merger at the Learn2 special
meeting. The foregoing percentage excludes shares of Learn2 or E-Stamp common
stock issuable to those persons upon exercise of stock options.

RECOMMENDATION OF THE LEARN2 BOARD OF DIRECTORS

     The board of directors of Learn2 has unanimously approved the merger and
the merger agreement and believes that the merger is advisable and in the best
interests of Learn2 and its stockholders. The Learn2 board of directors,
therefore, unanimously recommends that holders of Learn2 common stock vote FOR
approval of the merger and adoption of the merger agreement.

LEARN2 PROPOSAL NO. 2: ISSUANCE OF LEARN2 COMMON STOCK

     At the special meeting, the stockholders of Learn2 are being asked to
approve the issuance of approximately 26.5 million shares of Learn2 common stock
to the holder of Learn2's $10 million convertible debenture. Such shares will be
issued by Learn2 with a payment of $1 million by E-Stamp to redeem the
convertible debenture. THE ISSUANCE OF SHARES OF LEARN2 COMMON STOCK TO THE
HOLDER OF LEARN2'S $10 MILLION CONVERTIBLE DEBENTURE WILL BE EFFECTIVE ONLY IF
THE MERGER IS COMPLETED, AND THE MERGER WILL BE COMPLETED ONLY IF THE ISSUANCE
OF SHARES TO THE HOLDER OF LEARN2'S $10 MILLION CONVERTIBLE DEBENTURE IS
APPROVED. Immediately following the completion of the merger, the holder of
Learn2's $10 million convertible debenture will hold approximately 16.67% of the
combined company. For purposes of the foregoing calculation, the aggregate
number of issued and outstanding common stock of E-Stamp immediately following
the completion of the merger shall include shares of E-Stamp common stock
issuable upon exercise of options of E-Stamp and Learn2 that will be vested upon
completion of the merger and have an exercise price that is less than or equal
to the average closing price of E-Stamp or Learn2 common stock, respectively,
for the five consecutive trading days immediately preceding the E-Stamp or
Learn2 special meeting, as the case may be.

REQUIRED VOTE

     Approval of the issuance of approximately 26.5 million shares of Learn2
common stock to the holder of Learn2's $10 million convertible debenture
requires the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the shares of
outstanding shares of Learn2 common stock present or represented at the special
meeting.

RECOMMENDATION OF THE LEARN2 BOARD OF DIRECTORS

     The board of directors has unanimously approved the issuance of
approximately 26.5 million shares of Learn2 common stock to the holder of
Learn2's $10 million convertible debenture and believes that the issuance is
advisable and in the best interests of Learn2 and its stockholders. The board of
directors of Learn2, therefore, unanimously recommends a vote FOR the issuance
of approximately 26.5 million shares of Learn2 common stock to the holder of
Learn2's $10 million convertible debenture.

LEARN2 PROPOSAL NO. 3: REVERSE STOCK SPLIT CHARTER AMENDMENT

     The board of directors of Learn2 has unanimously recommended approval of a
reverse stock split amendment to Learn2's Amended and Restated Certificate of
Incorporation. The reverse stock split amendment will be effective only if the
merger between Learn2 and E-Stamp is not completed.

     The reverse stock split charter amendment will result in the automatic
conversion of between two and ten shares, as determined by the board of
directors of Learn2, of common stock outstanding as of the time of filing of the
reverse stock split charter amendment with the Secretary of State of the State
of Delaware into one new share of Learn2 common stock. The Learn2 board of
directors believes that stockholder approval of an exchange ratio range, as
opposed to approval of a specified exchange ratio, in which the reverse stock
split may be effected provides the Learn2 board of directors with maximum
flexibility to achieve the purposes of the reverse stock split. If the
stockholders of Learn2 approve the reverse stock split charter amendment at the
special meeting, the reverse stock split will be effected, if at all, only upon
the termination of the merger agreement and a determination by the Learn2 board
of directors that the reverse stock split, in an exchange ratio determined by
the Learn2 board of directors within the limits set forth herein, is in the best
interests of Learn2 and its stockholders at that time. If the Learn2 board of
directors fails to implement the reverse stock split within 120 days of the
termination of the merger agreement, Learn2 stockholder approval again would be
required prior to implementing any reverse stock split.

     As more fully set forth below, the principal reasons for the reverse stock
split are to increase the effective marketability and liquidity of Learn2's
common stock and to maintain the listing of Learn2's common stock on the Nasdaq
National Market. The Nasdaq Stock Market advised Learn2 on January 16, 2001 and
April 17, 2001 that its bid price was below $1.00 per share, the minimum per
share bid price

required under Marketplace Rule 4450(a)(5) to maintain a Nasdaq National Market
listing. Learn2 has requested an exception to Marketplace Rule 4450(a)(5),
pending the consummation of the merger or, if necessary, the reverse stock
split. On June 1, 2001, representatives of Learn2 attended a hearing before the
Nasdaq Qualifications Hearing Panel to determine if its common stock should
continue to be listed on the Nasdaq National Market. Learn2 has not yet been
notified by the Nasdaq Listing Qualifications Panel of its determination as a
result of that hearing. If the minimum per share bid price requirement is
satisfied by other means prior to the special meeting or the filing of the
reverse stock split charter amendment it is anticipated that the reverse stock
split will be abandoned.

     Learn2's Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation provides for 100
million authorized shares of common stock, $0.01 par value per share. As of the
record date,                shares of Learn2's common stock were issued and
outstanding.

     Attached to this joint proxy statement-prospectus as Annex VIII is the
proposed text of the reverse stock split charter amendment. Such text is subject
to change as may be required by the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware
or as the board of directors of Learn2 may deem necessary or advisable to effect
the reverse stock split. In the event of a change, the board of directors of
Learn2 will evaluate its materiality. In accordance with applicable law, if
there is a material change in the reverse stock split charter amendment Learn2
will resolicit stockholder approval.

PURPOSES AND REASONS FOR THE REVERSE STOCK SPLIT CHARTER AMENDMENT

     The board of directors of Learn2 believes that the reverse stock split is
beneficial to Learn2 and its stockholders. The principal reasons for the reverse
stock split are to increase the effective marketability and liquidity of
Learn2's common stock for Learn2's stockholders and to maintain the listing of
Learn2's common stock on the Nasdaq National Market.

     If Learn2's common stock were to be delisted from the Nasdaq National
Market, it likely would have an adverse effect on the trading and liquidity of
its common stock. In such event, Learn2's common stock would be quoted on the
OTC Bulletin Board, to the extent eligible therefor.

     The board of directors of Learn2 believes that the current price per share
of Learn2's common stock has a tendency to diminish the effective marketability
of Learn2's common stock because of the reluctance of many brokerage firms to
recommend lower-priced stocks to their clients. Additionally, the policies and
practices of a number of brokerage houses tend to discourage individual brokers
within those firms from dealing in lower-priced stocks. Some of these policies
and practices relate to the payment of broker's commissions and to
time-consuming procedures that operate to make the handling of lower-priced
stocks economically unattractive to brokers. The structure of trading
commissions also tends to have an adverse impact upon holders of lower-priced
stocks because the brokerage commission payable on the sale of a lower-priced
stock generally represents a higher percentage of the sales price than the
commission on relatively higher-priced stock.

     The board of directors also believes that the relatively low price of
Learn2's common stock, when compared with the market prices of common stock of
Learn2's competitors, impairs the marketability of Learn2's common stock to
institutional investors and members of the investing public and creates a
negative impression with respect to Learn2. Theoretically, the number of shares
of common stock outstanding should not, by itself, affect the marketability of
Learn2's common stock, the type of investor who acquires it or Learn2's
reputation in the financial community. In practice this may not necessarily be
the case, as many investors view low-priced stock as unduly speculative in
nature and, as a matter of practice, avoid or limit investments in such stocks.
The foregoing factors adversely affect not only the liquidity of Learn2's common
stock, but also Learn2's ability to raise additional capital through a sale of
equity securities.

     The board of directors is hopeful that the decrease in the number of shares
of common stock outstanding as a consequence of the proposed reverse stock
split, and the anticipated corresponding increased price per share, will
stimulate interest in Learn2's common stock and possibly promote greater

liquidity for Learn2's stockholders with respect to those shares presently held
by them. However, the possibility does exist that such liquidity may be affected
adversely by the reduced number of shares which would be outstanding if the
proposed reverse stock split is effected.

     The board of directors is also hopeful that the proposed reverse stock
split will result in a price level for the shares that will mitigate the present
reluctance, policies and practices on the part of brokerage firms referred to
above, diminish the adverse impact of trading commissions on the potential
market for Learn2's shares and enable Learn2's common stock to remain listed on
the Nasdaq National Market. However, the proposed reverse stock split may not
achieve the desired results outlined above and the price per share of Learn2's
common stock immediately after the proposed reverse stock split may not increase
proportionately with the reverse split. In addition, Learn2's common stock may
be delisted prior to the date of the special meeting.

     If the stockholders approve the reverse stock split charter amendment at
the special meeting, the reverse stock split will be effected, if at all, only
upon the termination of the merger agreement and a determination by the board of
directors that the reverse stock split, in an exchange ratio determined by the
board of directors within the limits set forth herein which is expected to allow
Learn2's common stock to qualify for continued listing on the Nasdaq National
Market, is in the best interests of Learn2 and its stockholders at that time.
Such determination will be based upon certain factors, including but not limited
to, the then-current price of Learn2's common stock, the availability of
additional working capital, existing and expected marketability and liquidity of
Learn2's common stock, prevailing market conditions and the likely effect on the
market price of Learn2's common stock. Notwithstanding approval of the reverse
stock split by the stockholders, the board of directors will effect the reverse
stock split only if the merger agreement is terminated and Learn2's common stock
has not regained compliance with the Nasdaq listing requirements.

CERTAIN EFFECTS OF THE REVERSE STOCK SPLIT CHARTER AMENDMENT

     Based on the           shares of common stock outstanding as of
            , 2001, the following table reflects the approximate percentage
reduction in the outstanding shares of common stock and the approximate number
of shares of common stock that would be outstanding as a result of the reverse
stock split:

                        PROPOSED                                         SHARES

                      STOCK SPLIT                         REDUCTION    OUTSTANDING
                      -----------                         ----------   -----------

1 for 2.................................................      50%
1 for 3.................................................      66%
1 for 4.................................................      75%
1 for 5.................................................      80%
1 for 6.................................................      83%
1 for 7.................................................      86%
1 for 8.................................................      87%
1 for 9.................................................      89%
1 for 10................................................      90%

     All outstanding options, warrants, rights and convertible securities will
be appropriately adjusted, as required by their terms, for the reverse stock
split automatically. THE REVERSE STOCK SPLIT WILL AFFECT ALL STOCKHOLDERS
EQUALLY AND WILL NOT AFFECT ANY STOCKHOLDER'S PROPORTIONATE EQUITY INTEREST IN
LEARN2. None of the rights currently accruing to holders of Learn2's common
stock, options or warrants to purchase common stock, or securities convertible
into common stock will be affected by the reverse stock split. Following the
reverse stock split, each share of new common stock will entitle the holder
thereof to one vote per share and will otherwise be identical to the old common
stock. The reverse stock split also will have no effect on the number of
authorized shares of common stock or the par value of Learn2's common stock.

EXECUTION AND CONSEQUENCES OF THE REVERSE STOCK SPLIT CHARTER AMENDMENT

     Each stock certificate representing old common stock will, after the filing
of the reverse stock split charter amendment, represent the appropriate number
of shares of new common stock reflecting the reverse stock split. It will not be
necessary for stockholders to exchange their existing stock certificates.
Stockholders may, however, exchange their certificates if they so choose.

     No scrip or fractional certificates will be issued in the reverse stock
split. In lieu of any such fractional shares, and solely for the purpose of
avoiding the expense and inconvenience of issuing fractional shares, any
stockholder who would otherwise receive a fractional share upon the reverse
stock split proposal will be entitled to receive one additional share of new
common stock. The number of shares of new common stock to be issued in
connection with settling such fractional interests is not expected to be
material.

     The reverse stock split may leave certain stockholders with shares of
Learn2's common stock in amounts less than one hundred shares. These shares may
be more difficult to sell, or require a greater commission per share to sell,
than shares in even multiples of one hundred.

MATERIAL FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSEQUENCES OF THE REVERSE STOCK SPLIT

     The following is a summary of the material anticipated federal income tax
consequences of the reverse stock split to stockholders of Learn2. This summary
is based on the provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, the
Treasury Department Regulations issued pursuant thereto, and published rulings
and court decisions in effect as of the date hereof, all of which are subject to
change. This summary does not take into account possible changes in such laws or
interpretations, including amendments to the Code, applicable statutes,
Regulations and proposed Regulations or changes in judicial or administrative
rulings; some of which may have retroactive effect. No assurance can be given
that any such changes will not adversely affect the discussion of this summary.

     This summary is provided for general information only and does not purport
to address all aspects of the possible federal income tax consequences of the
reverse stock split and is not intended as tax advice to any person or entity.
In particular, and without limiting the foregoing, this summary does not
consider the federal income tax consequences to stockholders of Learn2 in light
of their individual investment circumstances or to stockholders subject to
special treatment under the federal income tax laws (for example, dealers or
traders, alternative minimum tax provisions, foreign taxpayers, foreign
currencies, acquisitions in connection with compensatory transactions and
regulated investment companies). In addition, this summary does not address any
consequences of the reverse stock split under any state, local or foreign tax
laws. As a result, it is the responsibility of each stockholder to obtain and
rely on advice from his, her or its personal tax advisor as to: (i) the effect
on his, her or its personal tax situation of the reverse stock split, including
the application and effect of state, local and foreign income and other tax
laws; (ii) the effect of possible future legislation and Regulations; and (iii)
the reporting of information required in connection with the reverse stock split
on his, her or its own tax returns. It will be the responsibility of each
stockholder to prepare and file all appropriate federal, state and local tax
returns.

     No ruling from the Internal Revenue Service or opinion of counsel will be
obtained regarding the federal income tax consequences to the stockholders of
Learn2 as a result of the reverse stock split. Accordingly, each stockholder is
encouraged to consult his, her or its tax advisor regarding the specific tax
consequences of the proposed transaction to such stockholder, including the
application and effect of state, local and foreign income and other tax laws.

     Learn2 believes that the reverse stock split will qualify as a
"recapitalization" under Section 368(a)(1)(E) of the Code. As a result, no gain
or loss will be recognized by Learn2 or its stockholders in connection with the
reverse stock split. A stockholder of Learn2 who exchanges his, her or its old
common stock solely for new common stock will recognize no gain or loss for
federal income tax purposes. A stockholder's aggregate tax basis in his, her or
its shares of new common stock received from Learn2 will be the same as his, her
or its aggregate tax basis in the old common stock exchanged therefor.

The holding period of the new common stock received by such stockholder will
include the period during which the old common stock surrendered in exchange
therefor was held, provided all such common stock was held as a capital asset on
the date of the exchange.

TRANSFER AGENT AND REGISTRAR

     Learn2's Transfer Agent and Registrar is American Stock Transfer & Trust
Company, 6201 15th Avenue, Brooklyn, New York 11219

REQUIRED VOTE

     Approval of the reverse stock split charter amendment requires the
affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the shares of outstanding
shares of Learn2 common stock. The reverse stock split amendment will be
effective only if the merger is not consummated.

RECOMMENDATION OF THE LEARN2 BOARD OF DIRECTORS

     The board of directors of Learn2 has approved the reverse stock split
charter amendment and believes that the proposal is in the best interests of
Learn2 and its stockholders. The board of directors of Learn2, therefore,
unanimously recommends a vote FOR the proposal to approve the reverse stock
split charter amendment.

LEARN2 PROPOSAL NO. 4: ELECTION OF DIRECTORS OF LEARN2

     At the special meeting, the stockholders of Learn2 will elect five
directors to serve until the 2002 annual meeting of stockholders or until their
respective successors are elected and qualified. The election of directors would
be effective only if the merger is not consummated. The board of directors of
Learn2 has recommended the persons named in the table below as nominees for
election as directors. All such persons are presently directors of Learn2. In
the event any nominee should be unable or unwilling to serve as a director at
the time of the special meeting, it is intended that such proxy will be voted
FOR the election, in such nominee's place, of a substitute nominee recommended
by the board of directors of Learn2. As of the date of this joint proxy
statement-prospectus, the board of directors has no reason to believe that any
nominee will be unable or unwilling to serve as a director if elected.

MEETINGS AND COMMITTEES OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS

     During the 2000 fiscal year, the board of directors of Learn2 met and took
action by unanimous written consent on eight occasions, and no director then in
office attended fewer than 75% of the aggregate number of meetings of the board
of directors and meetings of the committees of the board of directors on which
he served. The board of directors of Learn2 has an Audit Committee and a
Compensation Committee. There is no standing nominating committee.

     The Audit Committee consists of James A. Cannavino, Robert Alan Ezrin and
S. Lee Kling, and met four times during the 2000 fiscal year. The Audit
Committee is responsible for monitoring the integrity of Learn2's financial
reporting process and systems of internal controls regarding finance, accounting
and legal compliance, monitoring the independence and performance of Learn2's
independent auditors and providing an avenue of communication among the
independent auditors, management and the board of directors of Learn2.

     The Compensation Committee consists of James A. Cannavino and Robert Alan

     The Executive Committee consists of Donald Schupak, James A. Cannavino and

Learn2's Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation or By-Laws cannot be
delegated by the Board of Directors.

DIRECTOR COMPENSATION

     Neither Messrs. Schupak or Gott receives any compensation for his services
as a Director. Learn2's outside directors earn $15,000 per annum, $4,000 per
annum for each committee membership, $1,000 per meeting for each Board of
Directors' meeting in which he participates and $500 for each committee meeting
in which he participates. They are reimbursed for their out-of-pocket expenses
incurred in attending board of directors' and committee meetings.

     In March 1997, Learn2 entered into an agreement with The Schupak Group,
Inc. whereby Learn2 paid $12,000 per month to Schupak West, Inc., an affiliate
of The Schupak Group, Inc. for the consulting services of Donald Schupak and
other employees of the Schupak Group, Inc. In January 2000, Learn2's agreement
with The Schupak Group, Inc. was amended to increase the consulting service fees
to $28,666 per month. Additionally, Mr. Schupak is entitled to the reimbursement
of reasonable travel and other expenses incidental to the performance of his
consulting duties. Mr. Schupak is entitled to have the Board of Directors
consider a bonus at the end of each fiscal year.

     On January 6, 2000 Messrs. Schupak, Cannavino and Ezrin were granted
options to purchase 500,000, 285,000 and 40,000 shares, respectively, of
Learn2's common stock originally exercisable at a price of $4.00 per share. Such
options vested immediately.

     On April 10, 2001, Learn2's Board of Directors approved a plan under which
each director, officer and employee would be given the opportunity to exchange
their existing stock options for new stock options with an exercise price of
$0.25 per share, subject to a new vesting schedule that will be approved by
E-Stamp. Messrs. Schupak, Cannavino and Kling have agreed that their previously
vested stock options would be subject to an additional one year of vesting. As a
result, E-Stamp and Learn2 are in the process of discussing appropriate vesting
schedules and other matters concerning the Learn2 stock options.

     On April 10, 2001, Messrs. Schupak, Cannavino and Kling were granted stock
options to purchase 1,000,000, 165,000 and 300,000, respectively, shares of
common stock at an exercise price of $0.25 per share. Such options are subject
to a one-year vesting period.

     On April 10, 2001, Mr. Gott was granted stock options to purchase 825,000
shares of common stock at an exercise price of $0.25 per share, subject to a
three year vesting schedule.

     In lieu of paying $26,500 in director fees for his services as a director
during fiscal year 2000, on April 10, 2001, Mr. Kling was granted stock options
to purchase 60,000 shares of common stock at an exercise price of $0.25 per
share. Such options are subject to a one year vesting period.

COMPLIANCE WITH THE EXCHANGE ACT

     Section 16(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, requires
Learn2's directors and executive officers and persons who own beneficially more
than 10% of a registered class of its equity securities to file reports of
ownership and changes in ownership with the Securities and Exchange Commission
on a timely basis. Reporting persons are required to furnish Learn2 with copies
of all such forms that they file. Based solely on Learn2's review of such forms,
except as set forth in the remainder of this section, Learn2 believes that all
filing requirements applicable to reporting persons during and with respect to
fiscal year 2000 were complied with on a timely basis. Mr. Schupak transferred
shares of

common stock to a partnership and filed a Form 5 required by Section 16(a) of
the Exchange Act on or about February 12, 2001.

REQUIRED VOTE

     Directors will be elected by a plurality of the votes cast by the holders
of Learn2's common stock voting in person or by proxy at the special meeting.
The five nominees receiving the highest number of affirmative votes of shares
entitled to be voted for them will be elected as directors of Learn2. Unless
marked otherwise, proxies received will be voted FOR the election of each of the
nominees named above. The election of directors will be effective only if the
merger is not consummated.

                    E-STAMP SPECIAL MEETING OF STOCKHOLDERS

DATE, TIME AND PLACE OF MEETING

     The date, time and place of the special meeting are as follows:
                                           , 2001
     , local time

PURPOSE OF THE SPECIAL MEETING

     The special meeting is being held so that stockholders of E-Stamp may
consider and vote upon:

     - a proposal to adopt a merger agreement between E-Stamp and Learn2,
       pursuant to which E-Stamp will merge with Learn2, and E-Stamp will be the
       surviving company and change its name to "Learn2 Corporation"; and

     - a proposal to increase the number of shares of E-Stamp common stock
       reserved for issuance under E-Stamp's 1999 Stock Plan by 6,500,000
       shares.

     Adoption of the merger agreement will also constitute approval of the
merger and the other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement. Holders
of E-Stamp stock may also consider and vote upon such other matters as may be
brought properly before the special meeting.

RECORD DATE

     E-Stamp's board of directors has fixed the close of business on
            , 2001, as the record date for determination of E-Stamp stockholders
entitled to notice of and to vote at the special meeting. On the record date,
there were                shares of E-Stamp common stock outstanding, held by
approximately                holders of record.

VOTING BY PROXY

     All shares of E-Stamp common stock represented by properly executed proxies
received before or at the E-Stamp special meeting will, unless the proxies have
been revoked previously, be voted in accordance with the instructions indicated
in those proxies. IF NO INSTRUCTIONS ARE INDICATED, SHARES OF E-STAMP COMMON
STOCK REPRESENTED BY THOSE PROXIES WILL BE VOTED "FOR" ADOPTION OF THE MERGER
AGREEMENT AND "FOR" THE INCREASE IN THE NUMBER OF SHARES RESERVED FOR ISSUANCE
UNDER THE 1999 STOCK PLAN. E-Stamp does not know of any matters other than as
described in the notice of special meeting of stockholders that are to come
before the special meeting. If any other matter is presented for action properly
at the special meeting, the persons named in the enclosed form of proxy will
have the discretion to vote on such matters in accordance with their judgment
unless authority to do so is withheld on the proxy card.

     A stockholder who has given a proxy may revoke it at any time prior to its
exercise by giving written notice to the Secretary of E-Stamp, by signing and
returning a later-dated proxy, or by voting in person at the special meeting.
However, mere attendance at the special meeting will not in and of itself have
the effect of revoking the proxy. Votes cast by proxy or in person at the
special meeting will be tabulated by the inspector of election appointed for the
special meeting.

SOLICITATION OF PROXIES

     E-Stamp and Learn2 will share equally in the expenses incurred in
connection with the printing and mailing of this joint proxy
statement-prospectus. E-Stamp may reimburse expenses incurred by brokerage

firms and other persons representing beneficial owners of shares in forwarding
solicitation material to such beneficial owners. E-Stamp has retained Mellon
Investor Services as proxy solicitors and expects to pay approximately $6,000
for this service. Proxies may also be solicited by certain of E-Stamp's
directors, officers and regular employees, without additional compensation other
than reimbursement of expenses, personally, by telephone or by telefax.

QUORUM; ABSTENTIONS; BROKER NON-VOTES

     The presence in person or by properly executed proxy of holders of a
majority of all the issued and outstanding shares of E-Stamp common stock
entitled to vote is necessary to constitute a quorum at the special meeting. For
purposes of determining whether a quorum is present, the inspector of election
will include shares that are present or represented by proxy, even if the
holders of such shares abstain from voting on any particular matter. In the
event that a broker, bank, custodian, nominee or other record holder of E-Stamp
common stock indicates on a proxy that it does not have discretionary authority
to vote certain shares on a particular proposal -- known as a broker
non-vote -- those shares will not be considered for purposes of determining the
number of shares entitled to vote with respect to a particular proposal on which
the broker has expressly not voted, but will be counted for purposes of
determining the presence or absence of a quorum for the transaction of business.
Accordingly, abstentions and broker non-votes will have the effect of a "no"
vote on the proposal to adopt the merger agreement but will not affect the
outcome of the voting on the amendment to the 1999 Stock Plan.

E-STAMP PROPOSAL NO. 1: THE MERGER AND RELATED TRANSACTIONS

     At the special meeting the E-Stamp stockholders are being asked to approve
the merger and adopt the merger agreement, which includes changing E-Stamp's
name to "Learn2 Corporation" upon the consummation of the merger. The terms of
the merger and the merger agreement are described in this joint proxy
statement-prospectus.

REQUIRED VOTE

     Approval of the merger and adoption of the merger agreement requires the
affirmative vote of holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of E-Stamp
common stock.

     As of the record date, directors, executive officers, including some former
officers, and one of E-Stamp's principal stockholders hold approximately   % of
the outstanding shares of E-Stamp's common stock, and have entered into
agreements to vote all shares of E-Stamp capital stock beneficially owned by
them in favor of the proposed merger and the name change.

RECOMMENDATION OF THE E-STAMP BOARD OF DIRECTORS

     The board of directors of E-Stamp has unanimously approved the merger
agreement and the merger and believes that the merger is advisable and in the
best interests of E-Stamp and its stockholders. The E-Stamp board of directors,
therefore, unanimously recommends that holders of E-Stamp stock vote FOR
approval of the merger and adoption of the merger agreement.

E-STAMP PROPOSAL NO. 2: AMENDMENT TO 1999 STOCK PLAN

     At the special meeting, the E-Stamp stockholders are being asked to approve
an amendment of the Company's 1999 Stock Plan (the "1999 Plan") to increase the
number of shares of common stock reserved for issuance thereunder by 6,500,000
shares.

     As of May 4, 2001, a total of 4,824,936 shares of common stock have been
reserved for issuance under the 1999 Plan. As of May 4, 2001, 296,170 shares had
been issued upon the exercise of stock options granted under the 1999 Plan, of
which 107,420 shares have been repurchased by E-Stamp, 893,979 options were
outstanding and 3,742,207 shares remained available for future grant. Under the
amendment, an additional 6,500,000 shares will be authorized and available for
future grants under the 1999 Plan.

     The 1999 Plan is structured to allow the board of directors broad
discretion in creating equity incentives in order to assist E-Stamp in
attracting, retaining and motivating the best available personnel for the
successful conduct of E-Stamp's business. E-Stamp believes that linking key
employee compensation to corporate performance through the use of stock options
increases employee motivation to enhance stockholder value. Therefore, E-Stamp
has included equity incentives as a significant component of compensation for a
broad range of E-Stamp's employees.

     The board of directors believes that the remaining shares available for
grant under the 1999 Plan are insufficient to accomplish the purposes of the
1999 Plan described above after the consummation of the merger. E-Stamp
anticipates that after the merger there will be a need to hire additional
technical, sales and marketing, and management employees and it will be
necessary to offer equity incentives to attract and motivate these individuals.
In addition, in order to retain the services of valuable employees as E-Stamp
and its employee base grows larger, it will be necessary to grant additional
options to current employees as older options become fully vested.

SUMMARY OF 1999 STOCK PLAN

     The board of directors adopted the 1999 Plan, in August 1999, and our
stockholders approved the 1999 Plan in August 2000. This stock option plan
provides for the grant to employees of incentive stock options within the
meaning of Section 422 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and for
the grant to employees, directors and consultants of nonstatutory stock options
and stock purchase rights.

     The number of shares reserved under the 1999 Plan is subject to annual
increases, equal to the lesser of:

     - 1,250,000 shares;

     - 3% of the outstanding shares on such date; or

     - a lesser amount determined by the board.

     The stock plan administrator, which is the board of directors or a
committee of the board, administers the 1999 Plan. In the case of options
intended to qualify as "performance based compensation" within the meaning of
the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, the committee will consist of two
or more "outside directors" within the meaning of the Internal Revenue Code of
1986, as amended.

     The administrator determines the exercise price of nonstatutory stock
options granted under the 1999 Plan, but with respect to nonstatutory stock
options intended to qualify as "performance based compensation" within the
meaning of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, the exercise price
must be at least equal to the fair market value of the common stock on the date
of grant. The exercise price of incentive stock options granted under the 1999
Plan must be at least equal to the fair market value of the common stock on the
date of grant. For any participant who owns stock possessing more than 10% of
the voting power of all classes of our capital stock, the exercise price of any
incentive stock option must equal at least 110% of the fair value on the date of
grant and the term of such incentive stock option must not exceed five years.
The term of all other options granted under the stock option plan may not exceed
10 years.

     Generally, an optionee must exercise an option granted under the 1999 Plan
within three months after the end of the optionee's status as an employee,
director or consultant of E-Stamp, or within 12 months after the optionee's
termination by death or disability, but in no event later than the expiration of
the option's term. Unless determined otherwise by the administrator, an optionee
generally may not transfer options and stock purchase rights granted under the
1999 Plan.

     The administrator determines the exercise price of stock purchase rights
granted under the 1999 Plan. In case of stock purchase rights, unless the
administrator determines otherwise, the restricted stock purchase agreement
entered into in connection with the exercise of the stock purchase rights
contains a repurchase option that we may exercise upon the voluntary or
involuntary termination of the purchaser's service with us for any reason,
including death or disability. The purchase price for shares we repurchase

under the restricted stock purchase agreements will be the original price paid
by the purchaser and may be paid by cancellation of any indebtedness of the
purchaser to us. The repurchase option lapses at a rate that the administrator
determines.

     The 1999 Plan provides that in the event of our merger with or into another
corporation or the sale of substantially all of our assets, the successor
corporation will assume or substitute each option or stock purchase right. If
the outstanding options or stock purchase rights are not assumed or substituted,
the administrator will provide notice to the optionee that he or she has the
right to exercise each outstanding option or stock purchase right as to all of
the shares subject to the option or stock purchase right, including shares that
would not otherwise be exercisable, for a period of 30 days from the date of the
notice. The options and stock purchase rights will terminate upon the expiration
of the 30-day period.

     Unless terminated sooner, the 1999 Plan will terminate automatically in
2009. In addition, the administrator has the authority to amend, suspend or
terminate the 1999 Plan, provided that no such action may affect any share of
common stock previously issued and sold or any option previously granted.

OFFICER AND DIRECTOR PARTICIPATION IN THE 1999 PLAN

     The grant of options under the 1999 Plan to executive officers and
directors, is subject to the discretion of the administrator. Options granted to
officers and directors are described more fully under "E-Stamp Management." As
of the date of this proxy statement, there has been no determination by the
administrator with respect to future awards under the 1999 Plan. Accordingly,
future awards are not determinable.

REQUIRED VOTE

     Approval of the increase to 1999 Plan requires the affirmative vote of the
holders of a majority of the shares of E-Stamp common stock present or
represented at the special meeting.

RECOMMENDATION OF THE E-STAMP BOARD OF DIRECTORS

     The board of directors of E-Stamp has approved the amendment to the 1999
Plan and believes that the increase is in the best interests of E-Stamp and its
stockholders. The E-Stamp board of directors, therefore, recommends that holders
of E-Stamp stock vote FOR the increase in the number of shares reserved for
issuance under the 1999 Plan.

                                   THE MERGER

     This section of this joint proxy statement-prospectus describes material
aspects of the proposed merger. While we believe that the description covers the
material terms of the merger, this summary may not contain all of the
information that is important to you. You should read this entire joint proxy
statement-prospectus, including the annexes and exhibits, carefully for a more
complete understanding of the merger and the terms of the merger agreement.

BACKGROUND OF THE MERGER

     In June 2000, E-Stamp engaged Credit Suisse First Boston to assist E-Stamp
in exploring potential strategic transactions.

     From June 2000 through March 2001, E-Stamp's executives and financial
advisors explored various financing alternatives and discussed potential
business combinations with numerous parties. During this period, E-Stamp's board
of directors met on fifteen occasions to review and discuss these potential
transactions.

     In October 2000, Learn2 engaged M. Kane & Company, Inc. and Dresdner
Kleinwort Wasserstein as its financial advisors. Learn2 authorized MK & Co. to
explore and evaluate strategic alternatives and extraordinary transactions and
DKW to explore and evaluate potential sources of equity financings.

     Following these engagements, representatives of CSFB, MK & Co. and DKW
contacted representatives of numerous parties that they believed might be
interested in pursuing a transaction with their respective clients. During this
time, Learn2 and E-Stamp became aware of each other.

     On February 8, 2001, Donald Schupak, Chairman of the Board of Learn2,
contacted Robert H. Ewald, President and Chief Executive Officer of E-Stamp, to
suggest that they consider a business combination involving E-Stamp and Learn2.
Mr. Schupak proposed that the combination be accomplished through a
stock-for-stock merger with Learn2 as the surviving company or an investment by
E-Stamp. Mr. Schupak did not make any specific proposals regarding the exchange
ratio in the merger and the board composition of the surviving corporation at
that time.

     On February 13, 2001, Messrs. Schupak, Ewald and Stephen P. Gott, President
and Chief Executive Officer of Learn2, had another conversation to discuss these
matters further and the growth strategies of Learn2 in the e-learning corporate
marketplace. In these discussions, Mr. Schupak continued to propose that Learn2
be the surviving corporation of any merger. There were no specific discussions
regarding the exchange ratio in the merger or the board composition of the
surviving corporation at that time.

     During the week of February 19, 2001, the companies began consulting with
their financial and legal advisors about issues raised in the discussions among
their executives. E-Stamp retained Wilson Sonsini Goodrich & Rosati, PC as its
legal counsel and Learn2 retained Swidler Berlin Shereff Friedman, LLP as its
legal counsel. Working with their financial and legal advisors, E-Stamp and
Learn2 began conducting their due diligence investigations using publicly
available materials and began analyses of a possible combination. These
consultations continued throughout the remaining merger discussions.

     In addition to a business combination, Learn2 also contacted several
parties in connection with a possible equity financing and the possible sale of
certain of its assets. As a result of this process, Learn2 has attempted to sell
eTracks.com, Inc. for a purchase price in excess of $2 million in cash. Learn2
also commenced discussions with certain investors that raise capital for
companies to discuss an equity investment in Learn2 of approximately $5 to $10
million. The equity investment transaction could have resulted in the issuance
of at least 40 million shares of Learn2 common stock or common stock
equivalents. If these securities were issued it would have resulted in a
substantial dilution to Learn2 stockholders' percentage ownership. Over the next
several weeks, Learn2 negotiated the terms of an equity financing but no
transaction was ever consummated due to the investor's decision not to proceed
with the equity financing on the terms originally proposed to Learn2. Learn2's
negotiations with the investor terminated in April 2001.

     Beginning in February 2001, Learn2 advised RGC International Investors,
LDC, the holder of Learn2's $10 million convertible debenture, of the status of
negotiations regarding a possible business combination or equity investment in
Learn2. Under the terms of the convertible debenture, Learn2 needed a waiver
from RGC to enter into a possible business combination or equity investment
without accelerating the redemption of the convertible debenture.
Representatives of Learn2 and RGC also discussed the redemption of the
convertible debenture. In addition, Learn2 discussed with RGC a waiver of
possible events of default under the convertible debenture, including Learn2's
covenants to maintain its listing on the Nasdaq National Market and file a
registration statement covering the shares of Learn2 common stock underlying the
convertible debenture following the reset of the conversion price of the
convertible debenture in March 2001.

     Over the next several weeks, representatives of Learn2 and RGC continued to
discuss the terms of the redemption of the convertible debenture. In connection
with the equity transaction described above, representatives of Learn2 and RGC
negotiated the redemption of the convertible debenture in exchange for six
million shares of Learn2 common stock and $4 million in cash.

     On February 21, 2001, Mr. Ewald discussed with Mr. Schupak a potential
business combination between E-Stamp and Learn2 in which E-Stamp stockholders
would receive a controlling interest in the combined company. Messrs. Ewald and
Schupak continued their discussion about a possible business combination,
elaborating on the benefits of the merger and the structure and implementation
of the merger.

     On February 27, 2001, the board of directors of Learn2 discussed the
proposed merger, strategic rationale for a merger, the appropriate exchange
ratio and the governance and management structure of the resulting entity.

     On March 5, 2001, the board of directors of Learn2 continued to discuss the
proposed business combination with E-Stamp. Mr. Schupak presented an update
regarding the status of negotiations with E-Stamp. The board of directors
authorized Learn2's management to continue its discussions with E-Stamp.

     On March 6, 2001, Mr. Schupak had a conversation with Robert J. Cresci, a
director of E-Stamp, concerning the rationale for the merger, the appropriate
exchange ratio and the governance and management structure of the resulting
entity. The discussions remained at a general level, and no agreement regarding
the specific terms of a possible merger was reached. Over the next month,
Messrs. Cresci and Schupak had periodic telephone conversations to discuss the
proposed combination.

     On March 7, 2001, the board of directors of Learn2 continued to discuss the
proposed business combination with E-Stamp and principal terms of a transaction.

     On March 8, 2001, Mr. Schupak presented to Mr. Ewald a non-binding proposal
outlining the terms for a possible business combination between E-Stamp and
Learn2 in which Learn2 would be the surviving corporation. The terms of the
proposal included the issuance of Learn2 common stock to the holders of E-Stamp
common stock such that E-Stamp stockholders would receive 50.1% of the
outstanding stock of Learn2. During that meeting, no agreement was reached about
an appropriate exchange ratio.

     From March 8, 2001 to March 14, 2001, Mr. Ewald and Edward F. Malysz, Vice
President, General Counsel and Acting Chief Financial Officer of E-Stamp,
participated in discussions with representatives of CSFB and WSGR regarding the
Learn2 proposal.

     On March 10, 2001, Mr. Malysz had a conversation with Mr. Schupak, in which
Mr. Malysz reviewed with Mr. Schupak E-Stamp's concerns regarding a transaction
in which Learn2 stock would be issued to E-Stamp stockholders and Learn2 would
be the surviving corporation. These concerns focused on the liquidity of Learn2
stock. During that conversation, Mr. Schupak again raised the possibility of an
investment in Learn2 by E-Stamp.

     On March 13, 2001 Mr. Malysz presented Mr. Schupak with an alternative
structure in which E-Stamp would acquire Learn2 through the issuance of E-Stamp
common stock to Learn2 stockholders.

     On March 14, 2001, representatives of CSFB, E-Stamp, DKW, Learn2, WSGR and
SBSF participated in a telephone conference to discuss the alternative
structures for a transaction and the exchange ratio. The structure proposed by
E-Stamp in this meeting was that E-Stamp would acquire Learn2 through the
issuance of E-Stamp common stock to Learn2 stockholders, with Learn2
stockholders to hold an approximately 49.9% interest in E-Stamp. At this
meeting, the parties first discussed E-Stamp's directors retaining a majority
position on the board of directors of the surviving company. The meeting
concluded with no definitive agreement on terms of a possible business
combination.

     From March 14, 2001 to March 21, 2001, representatives of CSFB, E-Stamp,
DKW and Learn2 participated in additional conversations regarding a potential
transaction.

     On March 19, 2001, E-Stamp executed a non-disclosure agreement with Learn2.

     On March 20, 2001, Mr. Malysz presented to Mr. Schupak a non-binding
proposal outlining revised terms for a possible business combination between
E-Stamp and Learn2. Terms of that proposal included: a proposed merger in which
E-Stamp would be the surviving corporation; an exchange ratio in which Learn2
stockholders would receive approximately 49.9% of the stock in the combined
company; E-Stamp's designation of a majority of the members of the board of
directors of the combined company; and a convertible loan from E-Stamp to
Learn2. That proposal did not specifically discuss Learn2's $10 million
convertible debenture.

     On March 21, 2001, Michael M. Arons, Vice President and Controller of
Learn2, met with Mr. Malysz at E-Stamp's offices to engage in financial due
diligence on E-Stamp.

     On March 21, 2001, there was a special telephonic meeting of the board of
directors of E-Stamp, which included a discussion of a potential strategic
transaction or business combination with Learn2.

     From March 21, 2001 to March 22, 2001, E-Stamp, Learn2 and their financial
and legal advisors engaged in discussions regarding the March 20th E-Stamp
proposal, and the parties continued to negotiate the terms, valuation and
structure of a potential business combination.

     On March 22, 2001, Mr. Ewald and Roderick Witmond, then Vice President,
Business Development, of E-Stamp met at Learn2's offices in White Plains, New
York with Messrs. Schupak, Gott and Arons and with Marc E. Landy, Executive Vice
President, Chief Financial Officer and Secretary of Learn2, and Kevin Riley,
President, Learning Services Division of Learn2. At this meeting, Messrs. Ewald
and Witmond continued their diligence investigation on Learn2's business. On
that same day, representatives of E-Stamp also visited Learn2's facilities in
Pryor, Oklahoma and Golden, Colorado.

     On March 22, 2001, the board of directors of Learn2 discussed the March
20th E-Stamp proposal. Learn2's legal counsel advised the board of directors of
its fiduciary obligations in considering a possible transaction with E-Stamp,
and reviewed with the Learn2 board the terms of the proposed merger and the
status of negotiations on those terms. The board of Learn2 asked questions of
Learn2's legal counsel, and a discussion ensued regarding open issues and
strategic alternatives.

     During the evening of March 22, 2001, the parties agreed upon a revised
non-binding proposal to form the basis for the drafting of definitive
transaction documents. Terms of that revised proposal included that the
convertible loan from E-Stamp to Learn2 would be in the amount of $2 million and
that Learn2's obligation to close the merger would be contingent upon E-Stamp
having at least $13 million in available cash at the closing of the proposed
merger. The remaining terms and conditions of the revised proposal were
substantially the same as the March 20th E-Stamp proposal and did not
specifically discuss Learn2's $10 million convertible debenture. Legal counsel
for both parties began to prepare and negotiate the definitive agreements for
the transaction.

     On March 23, 2001, Mr. Schupak accompanied Mr. Ewald and representatives of
WSGR to a hearing regarding continued listing of E-Stamp common stock on the
Nasdaq National Market before the Nasdaq Listing Qualifications Panel. At the
hearing, Mr. Ewald and Mr. Schupak responded to various questions from the
members of the panel regarding the terms and conditions of the proposed merger.

     On March 23, 2001, WSGR and SBSF exchanged legal due diligence request
lists concerning Learn2 and E-Stamp. From March 23, 2001 to March 26, 2001,
representatives of WSGR and SBSF conducted legal due diligence on Learn2 and
E-Stamp. During this time period, E-Stamp and CSFB met with representatives of
Learn2 and its financial advisor to conduct further business and financial
diligence on Learn2 and E-Stamp and Learn2 began to discuss the then existing
terms of Learn2's $10 million convertible debenture.

     From March 23, 2001 to March 29, 2001, E-Stamp's and Learn2's executive
officers, legal counsel and other representatives held further discussions to
negotiate the terms of the proposed merger agreement and related documents,
including valuation, the terms of the loan from E-Stamp to Learn2, the terms of
the proposed voting agreements to be entered into by certain directors and
executive officers of E-Stamp and Learn2, the termination rights contained in
the proposed merger agreement, the conditions upon which any termination fees
would be payable and the amount of such fees, E-Stamp's and Learn2's respective
rights under the proposed merger agreement to consider and negotiate other
acquisition proposals in certain circumstances, the terms upon which Learn2's
$10 million convertible debenture would be redeemed and the representations,
warranties and covenants to be made by E-Stamp and Learn2. During this period,
E-Stamp's and Learn2's financial advisors had further discussions regarding
valuation issues, and representatives of E-Stamp and its legal advisors
conducted further due diligence on Learn2's business, prospects, strategy and
financial condition. In addition, representatives of Learn2 discussed the
redemption of the convertible debenture which had been negotiated between Learn2
and RGC in connection with the equity financing described above.

     On March 25, 2001, there was a special telephonic meeting of the board of
directors of E-Stamp, which included a discussion of the proposed merger
agreement and related transactions. WSGR discussed the terms of the proposed
merger agreement and related transactions, including the termination rights
contained in the proposed merger agreement, the conditions upon which any
termination fees would be payable and the amount of such fees, and E-Stamp's and
Learn2's respective rights under the proposed merger agreement to consider and
negotiate other acquisition proposals in certain circumstances, and responded to
various questions raised by members of E-Stamp's board of directors regarding
the proposed merger agreement and related transactions. Mr. Malysz reviewed with
the E-Stamp board of directors an executive summary of the terms of the proposed
merger agreement and related transaction, and responded to various questions
raised by members of E-Stamp's board of directors regarding the terms of the
proposed merger agreement and related transaction. CSFB discussed its diligence
on Learn2, and responded to various questions from the E-Stamp board of
directors regarding its diligence on Learn2.

     On March 26, 2001, there was a special telephonic meeting of the board of
directors E-Stamp, which included a discussion of the merger agreement and
related transactions. CSFB made a presentation to the E-Stamp board of directors
regarding the terms of the proposed merger and information concerning Learn2's
financial performance, and responded to various questions raised by members of
E-Stamp's board of directors regarding its presentation. After considering the
terms of the proposed transaction, which at that time included the redemption of
Learn2's $10 million convertible debenture in exchange for six million shares of
Learn2 common stock and $4 million in cash, the E-Stamp board of directors
determined that its advisors conduct further diligence on Learn2 and that
Learn2's management be invited to meet with the E-Stamp board of directors.

     On March 28, 2001, E-Stamp engaged Houlihan Lokey Howard & Zukin to render
an opinion to E-Stamp regarding the fairness of the proposed merger from a
financial point of view to E-Stamp stockholders.

     On March 29, 2001, there was a special meeting of the board of directors of
E-Stamp, which included a presentation by Messrs. Gott and Riley, regarding
Learn2's business, strategy and financial condition. CSFB discussed its
financial due diligence on Learn2, and responded to various questions raised by
members of E-Stamp's board of directors regarding its diligence on Learn2. HLHZ
discussed its analysis of the merger, and responded to various questions raised
by members of E-Stamp's board of directors regarding its analyses. WSGR
discussed its legal due diligence on E-Stamp, and responded to various

questions raised by members of E-Stamp's board of directors regarding its
diligence on Learn2. The board of directors discussed the terms of the proposed
merger agreement, the convertible promissory note and related documents and a
representative from WSGR responded to questions regarding such documents from
the E-Stamp board of directors. After considering the terms of the proposed
transaction, the E-Stamp board of directors determined that further negotiations
regarding the termination of the outstanding Learn2 debenture and a reduction in
the amount payable to the debenture holder at closing were appropriate.

     From March 29, 2001 to April 9, 2001, the parties continued to negotiate
the terms, valuation and structure of a potential merger, including the terms on
which Learn2's outstanding debenture would be retired. Legal counsel for both
parties continued to prepare and negotiate the definitive agreements for the
transaction. During this time, the parties discussed the redemption of the
convertible debenture in order for the combined company to be debt free. The
parties also agreed that the combined company should maintain its working
capital to finance its business plan. In connection with the merger,
representatives of Learn2 negotiated the terms of the redemption of the
convertible debenture. Representatives of Learn2 and RGC discussed the combined
company's business plan and need for working capital. Over the next couple of
weeks, representatives of Learn2 and RGC negotiated the redemption of the
convertible debenture. In April 2001, RGC agreed to the redemption of the
convertible debenture in exchange for the issuance of approximately 26.5 million
shares of Learn2 common stock immediately prior to the completion of the merger
and a payment of $1 million in cash from E-Stamp. The issuance of shares to RGC
will represent approximately 16.67% of the outstanding shares of the combined
company's common stock immediately following the merger. For a further
description of the transactions between Learn2, E-Stamp and RGC see the section
entitled "Transactions with RGC International Investors, LDC" on pages 128 to
129.

     On April 9, 2001, there was a special meeting of the board of directors of
E-Stamp which included a discussion of the merger agreement and related
transactions. WSGR discussed its further legal due diligence on Learn2, and
responded to various questions raised by members of E-Stamp's board of directors
regarding its legal diligence on Learn2. HLHZ made a presentation to the E-Stamp
board of directors regarding the proposed merger, discussed its analyses of the
merger and responded to various questions raised by members of E-Stamp's board
of directors regarding its analyses. The E-Stamp board of directors discussed
the merger agreement and related documents and a representative from WSGR
responded to questions regarding such documents from the E-Stamp board of
directors. After considering the terms of the proposed transaction, the E-Stamp
board of directors determined that the proposed merger was advisable and in the
best interests of E-Stamp and its stockholders. The E-Stamp board of directors
then approved the merger agreement and the exhibits thereto, and the merger.

     From April 9, 2001 to April 19, 2001, the parties continued to negotiate
the terms of the redemption of Learn2's outstanding debenture and related
transactions.

     On April 10, 2001, the board of directors of Learn2 had a meeting to
consider the proposed transaction. At this meeting, Mr. Schupak and other
members of management reviewed the transaction with the board, including the
strategic reasons for the proposed transaction, the principal terms of the
proposed transaction, a financial review of the proposed transaction, a review
of E-Stamp's financial condition and the results of Learn2's due diligence
review. SBSF discussed the board's fiduciary duties in considering the strategic
business combination and further discussed the terms of the merger agreement and
related documents. The Learn2 board of directors reviewed a draft of the merger
agreement and related documents and a representative of SBSF responded to
questions regarding such documents from the Learn2 board of directors.
Representatives of MK&Co presented to Learn2's board of directors a summary of
its financial analyses related to proposed transaction. In addition, MK&Co.
delivered its opinion that the proposed transaction was fair, from a financial
point of view, to holders of Learn2's common stock, other than Learn2's
management, the holder of Learn2's convertible debenture and their affiliates,
as to which MK & Co. expressed no opinion. Upon completing its deliberations,
the board of directors of Learn2 unanimously approved the merger agreement and
the related agreements and

transactions contemplated by those agreements, declared them advisable and
resolved to recommend that Learn2's stockholders adopt the merger agreement.

     During the afternoon and evening of April 19, 2001, following approval of
the merger agreement and related matters by the E-Stamp board of directors and
the Learn2 board of directors, E-Stamp and Learn2 finalized, executed and
delivered the merger agreement and related documents.

     E-Stamp and Learn2 issued a joint press release announcing the execution of
the merger agreement and the terms of the merger on the morning of April 20,
2001.

LEARN2'S REASONS FOR THE MERGER; BOARD RECOMMENDATION

     At its meeting on April 10, 2001, Learn2's board of directors unanimously:

     - determined that the merger agreement and the merger are advisable, and in
       the best interests of, Learn2 and its stockholders;

     - directed that the merger proposal be submitted for consideration by the
       Learn2 stockholders; and

     - recommended that the Learn2 stockholders vote FOR the merger proposal.

     The board of directors of Learn2 believes that the merger with E-Stamp will
create a combined company which will have the potential of becoming the world's
leading provider of engaging e-learning products and services.

     The board of directors of Learn2 believes the following are key specific
reasons that the merger will be beneficial to Learn2 and in the best interest of
its stockholders:

     Potential for Growth.  The board of directors of Learn2 considered the view
of its management that the combination of Learn2 and E-Stamp is expected to
strengthen the ability of the combined company to generate growth in revenues.

     Expected Impact of the Merger.  The board of directors of Learn2 noted that
the merger of Learn2 and E-Stamp is expected to strengthen Learn2's balance
sheet through the addition of approximately $15 million of working capital. In
addition, the board of directors of Learn2 considered that in connection with
the merger Learn2 will convert its long-term debt into equity and make the
combined company debt free. The board of directors of Learn2 also noted that the
merger of Learn2 and E-Stamp would be accounted for as a purchase transaction.

     Opinion of MK&Co.  The board of directors of Learn2 considered a detailed
presentation by representatives of M. Kane & Company, Inc. regarding the
financial aspects of the proposed merger of Learn2 and E-Stamp, including the
ratio of exchanging shares of Learn2 common stock. The board of directors
reviewed the opinion of MK&Co. that the merger is fair, from a financial point
of view, to Learn2's stockholders, other than management of Learn2, the holder
of Learn2's $10 million convertible debenture, and their affiliates as to which
MK&Co. expressed no opinion.

     Corporate Governance Arrangements.  The board of directors of Learn2 noted
that the merger agreement provided that the board of directors of the combined
company will consist of nine individuals, five of whom will be designated by
E-Stamp and four of whom will be designated by Learn2. In addition, the board of
directors of Learn2 noted that the merger agreement provides that Robert H.
Ewald, the Chief Executive Officer of E-Stamp, will serve as Chairman of the
Board of the combined company, Donald Schupak, Chairman of the Board of Learn2,
will serve as Chairman of the Executive Committee of the combined company, and
Stephen P. Gott, Chief Executive Officer of Learn2, will serve as Chief
Executive Officer of the combined company. The board of directors of Learn2
concluded that these arrangements would reasonably assure the continuity of the
management of the combined company following completion of the merger and allow
a strong management team drawn from both Learn2 and E-Stamp to achieve the
combined company's business plan.

     Alternatives to the Merger.  The board of directors of Learn2 considered
alternatives to the proposed merger of Learn2 and E-Stamp, including continuing
to operate Learn2 as an independent entity, an

equity financing and the sale of certain assets. For a description of the
background of the merger see the section entitled "The Merger -- Background of
the Merger" on pages 44 to 49.

     Conditions, Termination Provision, Termination Fee.  The board of directors
of Learn2 reviewed the conditions to the completion of the merger and the
circumstances under which Learn2 or E-Stamp would have the right to terminate
the merger agreement. In addition, the board of directors of Learn2 reviewed the
provisions of the merger agreement that prohibit each of Learn2 and E-Stamp from
soliciting any proposal or offer regarding any acquisition of Learn2 or E-Stamp,
as the case may be. The board of directors of Learn2 also reviewed the
provisions of the merger agreement that require the board of directors of each
of Learn2 and E-Stamp to recommend the adoption of the merger agreement by the
stockholders of Learn2 and E-Stamp, as the case may be, and prohibit the board
of directors of each of Learn2 and E-Stamp from withdrawing or modifying its
recommendation. The board of directors also reviewed the amount that might be
payable in the event the merger agreement is terminated under specified
conditions.

     Voting Agreements and Lock-Up Agreements.  The board of directors of Learn2
considered the terms of the voting agreements to be entered into by each of the
executive officers and directors of Learn2 in connection with the merger
agreement. The board of directors of Learn2 noted that, under the voting
agreements, the executive officers and directors of Learn2 would agree to vote
all of their shares of common stock of Learn2 who hold in the aggregate
approximately 16.7% of Learn2's common stock in favor of the adoption of the
merger agreement. The foregoing percentage excludes shares of Learn2 common
stock issuable to those persons upon exercise of stock options. In addition, the
board of directors of Learn2 considered the terms of the lock-up agreements to
be entered into by each of the executive officers and directors of Learn2 in
connection with the merger. The board of directors noted that, under the lock-up
agreements, executive officers and directors of the combined company will
generally be prohibited from transferring shares of the combined company's
common stock before the merger and for the first six months following the
merger, and permit sales in only limited circumstances during the following six
months.

     Potential Adverse Consequences of the Merger.  The board of directors of
Learn2 considered several risks associated with the merger of Learn2 and E-Stamp
that have the potential of creating adverse consequences for Learn2. In
particular, the board of directors of Learn2 considered the risk of diverting
management resources from other strategic opportunities and operational matters
for an extended period of time and the possibility that the potential benefits
of the merger may not be realized. The board of directors of Learn2 also
considered the possibility that the merger might not be completed and the
substantial costs in an amount equal to approximately $1.7 million to be
incurred in connection with the merger. In addition, the board of directors of
Learn2 considered the risks described in this joint proxy statement-prospectus
under "Risk Factors" on page 17.

     In view of the wide variety of factors considered in connection with its
evaluation of the merger and the complexity of these matters, the Learn2 board
did not find it useful to and did not attempt to quantify, rank or otherwise
assign relative weights to these factors. The Learn2 board of directors relied
on the experience and expertise of MK&Co., its financial advisor, for
quantitative analysis of the financial terms of the merger. For a description of
the opinion of MK&Co. see the section entitled "Opinion of Learn2 Financial
Advisor" on pages 51 to 58. In addition, the Learn2 board of directors did not
undertake to make any specific determination as to whether any particular
factor, or any aspect of any particular factor, was favorable or unfavorable to
the Learn2 board of director's ultimate determination, but rather the Learn2
board conducted an overall analysis of the factors described above, including
thorough discussions with and questioning of Learn2 management and legal and
financial advisors. In considering the factors described above, individual
members of the Learn2 board of directors may have given different weight to
different factors.

     The Learn2 board considered all these factors as a whole, and overall
considered the factors to be favorable to and support its determination.

OPINION OF LEARN2 FINANCIAL ADVISOR

     The preparation of a fairness opinion is a complex process and is not
necessarily susceptible to partial analysis or summary description. The
following is a brief summary and general description of the valuation
methodologies utilized by M. Kane & Company, Inc. or MK&Co. This summary does
not purport to be a complete statement of the analyses and procedures applied,
the judgments made or the conclusion reached by MK&Co. or a complete description
of its presentation. MK&Co. believes, and so advised the board of directors of
Learn2, that its analyses must be considered as a whole and that selecting
portions of its analyses and of the factors it considered, without considering
all factors and analyses, could create an incomplete view of the process
underlying its analyses and opinions.

     Learn2 retained MK&Co. to render an opinion to be addressed to the board of
directors of Learn2, as to the fairness, from a financial point of view, of the
merger to the public stockholders of Learn2, other than management of Learn2,
the holder of Learn2's convertible debenture, and their affiliates as to which
MK&Co. expresses no opinion, from a financial point of view, without giving
effect to any other benefits that may inure to any particular stockholder as a
result of the proposed transaction other than in its capacity as a stockholder.
At the April 10, 2001 meeting of the board of directors, MK&Co. presented its
analyses as described below and delivered its written opinion that as of such
date and based on the matters described in the opinion, the consideration to be
received by the stockholders of Learn2 in connection with the merger is fair to
the public shareholders of Learn2, other than management of Learn2, the holder
of Learn2's convertible debenture, and their affiliates as to which MK&Co.
expresses no opinion from a financial point of view, without giving effect to
any other benefits that may inure to any particular shareholder as a result of
the proposed transaction other than in its capacity as a stockholder.

     THE COMPLETE TEXT OF MK&CO.'S OPINION IS ATTACHED AS ANNEX VI. WHILE LEARN2
BELIEVES THAT THE SUMMARY OF THE OPINION SET FORTH BELOW SUMMARIZES THE MATERIAL
TERMS OF THE OPINION, LEARN2 STOCKHOLDERS ARE URGED TO READ SUCH OPINION
CAREFULLY IN ITS ENTIRETY FOR A DESCRIPTION OF THE PROCEDURES FOLLOWED, THE
FACTORS CONSIDERED AND THE ASSUMPTIONS MADE BY MK&CO.

     MK&Co.'s opinion to the board of directors addresses only the fairness from
a financial point of view, of the merger to certain stockholders of Learn2, and
does not constitute a recommendation to the stockholders as to how such
stockholders should vote at the special meeting. MK&Co.'s opinion does not
address Learn2's underlying business decision to effect the merger.

     Although the opinion and engagement letter of MK&Co. states that the
opinion is for the board of directors only, the effectiveness of this
contractual limitation under applicable state law has not been directly
determined by any controlling authority. Moreover, the existence of such a
defense will have no effect on the rights and responsibilities of the board of
directors of Learn2 under applicable law. In particular, the registrant and
MK&Co. have been advised that, in the opinion of the Securities and Exchange
Commission, the availability of a state law defense for MK&Co. would have no
effect on the rights and responsibilities of either MK&Co. or the board of
directors of Learn2 under the federal securities laws.

     In connection with the preparation of its opinion, MK&Co. made such
reviews, analyses and inquiries as it deemed necessary and appropriate under the
circumstances. Among other things, MK&Co.:

     1. Reviewed and considered recent historical financial and business
        information, including results of operations and cash flow of Learn2,
        and certain other financial information, contained in documentation
        provided to it by Learn2;

     2. Held discussions with members of the management of Learn2 regarding the
        past and current business operations and financial condition and future
        prospects of Learn2;

     3. Reviewed forecasts supplied to MK&Co. by Learn2 with respect to internal
        projected financial and operating results, including earnings and cash
        flow of Learn2;

     4. Reviewed pro forma operating and cash flow statements and balance sheets
        of Learn2 supplied to MK&Co. by Learn2, assuming consummation of the
        merger;

     5. Reviewed publicly available financial and market data for certain public
        companies engaged in business similar to Learn2;

     6. Reviewed publicly available financial information relating to recent
        acquisitions involving companies comparable to Learn2;

     7. Reviewed the historical stock market prices and trading volumes of the
        outstanding common stock of Learn2; and

     8. Reviewed the principal financial terms of the implementing documentation
        provided to MK&Co. with respect to the merger.

Assumptions and Limitations

     In rendering its opinion, MK&Co. relied upon, without independent
verification or investigation, the accuracy and completeness of the information
available from public sources or provided to MK&Co. by Learn2 and its
representatives. With respect to the internal forecasts regarding the future
financial and operating results of Learn2 and the pro forma information provided
to MK&Co., MK&Co. assumed, without independent verification or investigation,
that such forecasts and pro forma information were prepared on bases reflecting
the best currently available information, estimates and judgments of the
management of Learn2 and that the assumptions underlying the forecasts and pro
forma information were reasonable. MK&Co. did not make or obtain any independent
evaluations or appraisals of the assets or liabilities of Learn2. MK&Co. relied,
without independent verification or investigation, on the financial statements
of Learn2 provided by its management. MK&Co.'s opinion was based upon its
assessment of general economic, financial and market conditions as they existed
and could be evaluated by MK&Co. as of the date of its letter.

     In rendering its opinion, MK&Co. also assumed that the economic and
financial climate, characterized in part by the unfavorable equity capital
market conditions for companies with the recent financial operating performance
similar to Learn2, will generally continue, at least through the period
necessary to consummate the proposed transaction.

     In rendering its opinion, MK&Co. also relied upon the fact that Learn2 was
advised by counsel as to all legal matters with respect to the proposed
transaction, including whether all procedures required by law to be taken in
connection with the proposed transaction, in fact, have been duly, validly and
timely taken. MK&Co. did not make any representation or render any opinion as to
any legal matter.

     Learn2 specifically informed MK&Co. that it reviewed and approved its
assumptions and that it understood that, to the extent that any of the
assumptions or any of the facts on which MK&Co.'s opinion was based proves to be
untrue in any material respect, MK&Co.'s opinion cannot and should not be relied
upon.

Analysis of Historical Performance

     MK&Co. analyzed Learn2's historical performance through the reporting
period ended December 31, 2000. Learn2 has been unable to generate pretax profit
since inception. Historical income statements yielded the following comparisons:
(i) revenues peaked in fiscal year 1996 at $20.5 million, declining in fiscal
year 1997 to $10.8 million as Learn2 implemented a new strategy to transition
from being a self-funded content developer and publisher to position itself as a
supplier of custom solutions, services, tools and technology. For fiscal years
1998, 1999 and 2000, Learn2's revenues were $2.7 million, $12.2 million and
$22.1 million, respectively; (ii) Learn2's earnings before depreciation,
amortization, interest expense and income, taxes, extraordinary gain and
restructuring charges or EBITDA posted a low of ($22.8) million in fiscal 1996,
and registered the least loss, ($6.1) million, in fiscal year 1998. EBITDA for
fiscal years 1999 and 2000 were ($9.4) million and ($13.3) million,
respectively; (iii) Learn2's

earnings before interest expense and income taxes, extraordinary gain and
restructuring charges or EBIT posted a low of ($25.5) million in fiscal year
1996, and yielded the best financial performance, a loss of ($7.9) million, in
fiscal year 1998. EBIT for fiscal years 1999 and 2000 were ($12.7) million and
($19.3) million, respectively. (iv) Learn2 has incurred net losses every year
since inception. Net losses for fiscal years 1998, 1999, and 2000 were ($10.6)
million, ($41.0) million and ($38.0) million, respectively.

     Coincident with the decline of the Nasdaq composite index since the fourth
calendar quarter of 2000, tolerance is low among investors for companies with a
pattern of financial losses. Consequently, it is MK&Co.'s conclusion supported
on a practical basis by the results of Learn2's efforts to elicit alternative
sources of equity financing, that it is unlikely that equity capital will be
available on terms superior to those provided by the merger.

Stock Trading History

     MK&Co. examined the history of the trading prices and volume of Learn2's
common stock. The closing price of Learn2's common stock was $0.23 per share on
April 6, 2001, which aggregated to a public market value of equity of
approximately $12 million. This price was 94% below its 52 week high of $3.81
per share on April 7, 2000. The average closing price of Learn2's common stock
in the ten trading days ending April 6, 2001 was $0.21. While the stock prices
of all of the publicly traded companies to which MK&Co. compared Learn2 declined
in the same period, Learn2's absolute stock price decline most closely resembled
the pattern for those companies, like Learn2, that reported over the period a
continuing pattern of operating losses and evidenced increasing capital
sufficiency and liquidity risk. See Comparable Company Analysis "Second Group"
below. Accordingly, the public market value of Learn2's equity securities is
unlikely to improve until it addresses this risk. Learn2 has represented to
MK&Co. that addressing this capital sufficiency and liquidity risk is an
important motivation for entering into the merger.

Comparable Company Analysis

     MK&Co. reviewed selected consolidated financial information, through the
reporting period ended December 31, 2000, the most recent information publicly
available at the time, of certain other companies in lines of businesses it
believed to be comparable to the business of Learn2. Two groups of comparable
companies were selected for the analysis. The first group did not evidence
significant capital sufficiency or liquidity risk in their public filings and
the second group did. The first group of companies which included: Centra
Software, Inc., Docent, Inc., DigitalThink, Inc., eCollege, Inc., Saba Software,
Inc., SmartForce plc, and Skillsoft Corporation and had an adjusted average
multiple of approximately 9.82X the revenue of the trailing twelve month period
or TTM. The second group of companies included in the analysis were:
Click2Learn, Caliber Learning, Inc., Gilat Communications, Ltd.,
Instructivision, Inc., CollegeLink.com, Inc., and Whitman Education Group and
had an adjusted average multiple of approximately 0.46X the revenue of the TTM.
MK&Co. analyzed, among other things, stock trading data and various financial
operating ratios. An analysis of the selected companies is not mathematical;
rather, it involves complex considerations and judgments concerning differences
in financial and operating characteristics of the companies available for
comparison.

     The following tables illustrate the Market Values and associated public
market trading multiples, of each of the comparable companies as of April 6,
2001:

                                                                 ADJUSTED AVERAGE*          0.46X
                                            *Excludes the high and low statistics.

     The public market value of Learn2 at the time of the analysis was
approximately 0.55 times adjusted average TTM revenue, reflecting, in part,
investors' assessments about Learn2's financial performance and capital
sufficiency and liquidity risk. In contrast, by completing the transaction,
Learn2 could mitigate its capital sufficiency and liquidity risk, making it more
comparable to the first group of e-learning companies. As a result, the value to
Learn2 shareholders in the context of the proposed transaction could be computed
as approximately $71.4 million utilizing the same mode of analysis but the
higher multiple of approximately 9.82X. The computed value to Learn2
stockholders takes account of both the redemption and termination of that
certain $10 million convertible debenture and the issuance of approximately
33.34% of Learn2's outstanding common stock immediately prior to the
consummation of the merger in connection with such redemption.

     MK&Co. noted that the utility of this analysis was limited. As a result of
the Company's financial performance, only historical revenues provided a
reliable positive parameter, from among those customarily used, from which to
derive an equity value comparison. Forward-looking parameters were problematical
because they would all necessarily assume that immediate and sustainable
external financing was available

on acceptable terms, an assumption which had no firm basis in fact. MK&Co.
cautioned that conclusions premised on excessive reliance on only one of many
possible financial parameters (e.g., EBITDA, EBIT, net income, tangible book
value) could not be regarded with a high degree of reliability in any case.

Analysis of Selected Transactions

     MK&Co. reviewed four merger and acquisition transactions for which adequate
price and other information was publicly available. These transactions took
place at various times within the last three calendar years and involved
Internet software and e-business companies with working capital deficiencies and
negative operating cash flow. MK&Co. concluded that there were no substantially
identical financial transactions in the e-learning industry involving a target
with the mix of market capitalization and financial performance characteristics
similar to those found at Learn2. The four selected transactions are the
respective acquisitions of:

          (i.)  Circle.com by Havas Advertising;

          (ii.)  CCRL LLC by Launch Media Inc.;

          (iii.) Resumix, Inc. by HotJobs.com Ltd; and

          (iv.) Trent Graphics, Inc. by Network Event Theater, Inc.

     With respect to the foregoing transactions, MK&Co. analyzed purchase prices
in relation to various financial operating ratios. Like the analysis of the
selected comparable companies, an analysis of selected transactions is not
mathematical; rather, it also involves complex considerations and judgments
concerning differences in financial and operating characteristics of the
companies and transactions available for comparison and the nature of the
financial market environment contemporaneous with the transaction.

     MK&Co. noted that the utility of this analysis was limited. As a result of
Learn2's financial performance, only historical revenues provided a reliable
parameter, from among those customarily used, from which to derive an equity
value comparison.

     The targets of the financial transactions selected share the following
characteristics with Learn2: (i) the targets had relatively low cash balances;
(ii) the targets had working capital deficiencies; (iii) the targets had
negative EBITDA; and (iv) the targets incurred net losses. The average of equity
value paid to TTM revenue multiple is 1.07X. MK&Co. then applied a 48.8 percent
discount to the TTM, to adjust for the diminution in the Nasdaq composite index
during the six-month period ending on April 6, 2001, the period during which
Learn2 was investigating alternatives and structured the proposed merger.
Indexing the results of the comparable transaction analysis to the diminution in
value of publicly-traded, Nasdaq-listed companies, as represented by the Nasdaq
composite index, yields an implied market value for Learn2's equity of
approximately $12.0 million. As indicated by the Comparable Company Analysis and
the Discounted Cash Flow Analysis, this implied valuation is substantially less
than the market value of Learn2's equity implied if Learn2 can mitigate its
capital sufficiency and liquidity risk. Learn2 has represented to MK&Co. that
addressing this capital sufficiency and liquidity risk is an important
motivation for entering into the merger.

Projected Financial Statements

     MK&Co. reviewed certain internal projected financial forecasts prepared by
Learn2's management for the 2001 through 2003 fiscal years and noted that, among
other things, Learn2's capital sufficiency and liquidity risk was dependent on
Learn2's management's assumption that Learn2 would collect its accounts
receivable projected in its internal financial forecast in a timely fashion. If
Learn2 does not to achieve sales or collect accounts receivable at the rates
projected, Learn2 is likely to be required to raise additional capital which
might not be available. The merger affords a capital reserve to weather adverse
variances in sales and collections greater than those assumed by Learn2
management.

Discounted Cash Flow Analysis

     To conduct a discounted cash flow analysis, MK&Co. reviewed the available
annual financial forecasts for Learn2, on a stand-alone basis, as prepared by
Learn2's management, for the 2001 through 2003 fiscal years. MK&Co. projected,
based on assumptions that MK&Co. believed to be reasonable, an additional 2
years to provide projected data through 2005. Based on Learn2's projections,
free cash flow, EBITDA less changes in working capital, less capital
expenditure, is projected to increase from ($2.17) million in 2001, to $10.6
million in fiscal year 2005. The forecasts assume that the collection of
Learn2's accounts receivable will result in sufficient cash to fund operations;
but also takes account of the attendant risk by applying a discount rate derived
from analysis of the rate of return under contemporaneous capital market
conditions required by investors purchasing the securities of an issuer with
comparable capital sufficiency and liquidity risk. Viatel, Inc., a company with
comparable financial characteristics to Learn2, like Learn2, laid off a
substantial percentage of its workforce and retained an investment banking firm
to explore strategic alternatives. For an April 1998 issue of its corporate
bonds, due April 2008, the computed yield is 67%. Accordingly, Viatel Inc.'s
corporate bond yield to maturity serves as a benchmark for the rate of return
required by investors purchasing recently issued securities of a company in
comparable financial condition. Discounting Learn2's projected five-year cash
flows at a rate of 67% yields a present value of approximately $11.0 million.

     In contrast, the value to Learn2 shareholders in the context of the
proposed transaction, utilizing the same mode of analysis, is approximately $110
million. This implied value to Learn2 shareholders also takes account of both:
1) the additional dilution caused by the repurchase of the RGC Debenture; and 2)
the equity share retained by the E-Stamp shareholders in exchange for the cash
remaining after winding down the business and operations of E-Stamp. The
difference is attributable to the fact that with access to capital, it will be
possible to invest sooner in the expansion of Learn2's business. Under the
combined scenario associated with the proposed transaction, Learn2 projects free
cash flow will increase from ($12.1) million in 2001, to $67.8 million in fiscal
year 2005. Moreover, with the mitigation of capital sufficiency and liquidity
risk, the applicable discount rate is derived from the weighted average cost of
capital for the financially healthier, publicly traded comparable e-learning
companies. The weighted average cost of capital applied in this analysis is 14%,
which is derived by the following factors: risk free rate of 4.3%, yield on
6-month treasury bill as of March 25, 2001, beta of 1.0x, average of comparable
companies, market risk premium of 10%, cost of debt of 6%, weighted average
interest rate paid on Learn2's debt, and tax rate of 38%, estimated federal and
state tax rates.

Liquidation Analysis

     MK&Co. also prepared, from information provided by Learn2, a liquidation
analysis. The analysis estimated the liquidation value of Learn2's total assets
at $13.7 million. After deducting estimated legal and collection fees of $3.2
million, an estimated $10.5 million remains to satisfy creditors, which
represented a potential recovery to unsecured creditors of 67.0% of the
outstanding amounts owed to them by Learn2, $9.3 million in convertible debt and
$6.3 million in accounts payable and other accruals. If such a scenario were to
materialize, Learn's common stock would be worthless.

     The material assumptions upon which the liquidation analysis was based are
as follows: (i) accuracy and completeness of the information reviewed, without
independent verification; (ii) affirmation by Learn2 and review by Learn2 of the
treatment, reasonableness and feasibility of prospective dispositions of assets
and liabilities included in the analysis; and (iii) estimation and affirmation
by Learn2 of collection, legal and administrative fees incident to liquidation.
With respect to asset values, in consultation with Learn2, in liquidation it was
assumed that the following would be realizable: (i) approximately 80 percent of
trade accounts receivable; (ii) approximately 30 percent of inventory; (iii)
approximately 20 percent of the book value of computer equipment; (iv) office
equipment and furniture and fixtures could be liquidated at approximately 10
percent of their gross book value; (v) land could be liquidated at approximately
80 percent of gross book value; (vi) intangible and capitalized software could
be liquidated at approximately 35 percent of their net value; (vii) cash was
assumed to have full value in liquidation; and (viii) prepaid expenses, computer
software, leasehold improvements, and goodwill were assumed to have

no value in liquidation. With respect to estimated liabilities, in consultation
with Learn2, it was assumed that (i) the convertible debenture of $9.3 million
would be paid in full; and (ii) unsecured creditors would receive residual
proceeds.

Fairness of the Proposed Transaction Consideration

     MK&Co. believes the merger is fair to Learn2's stockholders, other than
management of Learn2, the holder of Learn2's convertible debenture, and their
affiliates as to which MK&Co. expresses no opinion from a financial point of
view, without giving effect to any other benefits that may inure to any
particular stockholder as a result of the merger other than in its capacity as a
stockholder, based on a number of factors, including the ones listed below.
MK&Co. did not assign a particular weight to any one of the factors described
below, although MK&Co. viewed as particularly significant Learn2's capital
resources and liquidity risk.

          1. Loss of Value in the Event of Insolvency and Liquidation. MK&Co.
     believed that the proposed merger is fair because, among other things,
     Learn2's stockholders are unlikely to realize any value for Learn2's common
     stock if Learn2 must liquidate.

          2. Negotiation of the Proposed Transaction. The terms of the proposed
     merger were determined through arms-length negotiations between Learn2 and
     E-Stamp.

          3. Potential Substantial Dilution of Equity. If the proposed merger is
     not consummated or the merger agreement is terminated and Learn2 fails to
     meet its internal projected forecasts, Learn2 then in certain circumstances
     would have to raise capital via other means. Based on equity capital market
     conditions existing contemporaneously with the proposed merger, Learn2
     would have difficulty raising equity on terms favorable to Learn2.

     MK&Co. and Learn2 do not currently intend for MK&Co. to update or revise
its fairness opinion prior to the completion of the merger. If a material
amendment is made to the merger agreement, or if a significant event occurs
prior to the completion of the merger, the Learn2 board of directors will
consider whether or not to request that MK&Co. update its fairness opinion.
Learn2 is not aware of any significant events or changes that have occurred
which could or would alter the fairness determination.

     MK&Co. is a nationally recognized investment banking firm with special
expertise in, among other things, valuing businesses and securities and
rendering fairness opinions. Learn2 selected MK&Co. because of its experience
and expertise in performing valuation and fairness analysis for companies
serving the for-profit education and training markets. MK&Co. values businesses
and securities in connection with mergers and acquisitions, private placements
of debt and equity, corporate reorganizations, and other purposes. MK&Co. does
not beneficially own nor has it ever beneficially owned any interest in Learn2
or E-Stamp.

Fees and Expenses

     Pursuant to an agreement dated October 31, 2000 and subsequently amended as
of March 21, 2001, in exchange for MK&Co.'s investment banking services related
to the proposed transaction, including its fairness opinion, Learn2 has agreed
to pay MK&Co. a fee equal, as of the date of its opinion, to $200,000 plus
$15,000 per month thereafter until the earlier of consummation of the merger or
termination of the merger agreement, or, if greater, 2.0625% of the merger
consideration. Learn2 has further agreed to pay to MK&Co. its reasonable
out-of-pocket expenses and to indemnify MK&Co. against certain liabilities and
expenses in connection with the rendering of its services.

E-STAMP'S REASONS FOR THE MERGER; BOARD RECOMMENDATION

     On April 9, 2001, the E-Stamp Board of Directors voted unanimously to
approve the merger agreement and the terms of the merger. The board also:

     - determined that the merger agreement and the merger were advisable, and
       in the best interests of, E-Stamp and its stockholders;

     - directed that the merger proposal be submitted for consideration by the
       E-Stamp stockholders; and

     - recommended that the E-Stamp stockholders vote FOR the merger proposal.

     In the course of reaching its decision to approve the merger agreement and
the merger, E-Stamp's board of directors consulted with E-Stamp's senior
management, as well as its outside legal counsel and its financial advisors. The
E-Stamp board also considered the following material factors:

     - historical information concerning Learn2's business, financial
       performance, operations, management and competitive positions, including
       public reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission;

     - current financial market conditions and trading information with respect
       to E-Stamp and Learn2 common stock;

     - terms of the merger agreement, including E-Stamp's ability to consider a
       superior acquisition proposal and the circumstances under which the
       E-Stamp board may withdraw its recommendation of the merger;

     - the expected treatment of the merger as a tax-free reorganization for
       U.S. federal income tax purposes;

     - alternatives to the merger including the body of transactions considered
      by the board since June 2000;

     - the presentation by Houlihan Lokey regarding the financial information,
       valuation analysis and other factors related to the merger as well as the
       fairness of the merger to the E-Stamp stockholders; and

     - the conflicts of interests of certain directors and executive officers of
       E-Stamp in the merger as described in "Conflicts of Interests of Learn2
       and E-Stamp Officers and Directors in the Merger" on page 63.

     The board also considered certain negative factors and risks associated
with the merger including:

     - the dilution to E-Stamp stockholders to their percentage ownership in the
      combined company;

     - the risk of diverting management resources from other strategic
       opportunities and operational matters for an extended period of time;

     - the possibility that the merger might not be completed, and the fact that
       under some circumstances E-Stamp might be required to pay a termination
       fee to Learn2; and

     - the substantial costs to be incurred in connection with the merger.

     In analyzing the proposed merger, none of the factors above was viewed by
the E-Stamp board of directors as determinative, and the board did not quantify
or ascribe particular weight to any single factor. Rather, the board made its
determination based upon the total mix of information available to it and
determined that the aggregate positive factors outweighed the aggregate negative
factors. Moreover, individual members of the board may have assigned different
values to different factors.

OPINION OF E-STAMP FINANCIAL ADVISOR

     The preparation of a fairness opinion is a complex process and is not
necessarily susceptible to partial analysis or summary description. The
following is a brief summary and general description of the valuation
methodologies utilized by Houlihan Lokey Howard & Zukin Financial Advisors. The
summary does not purport to be a complete statement of the analyses and
procedures applied, the judgments made or the conclusion reached by HLHZ or a
complete description of its presentation. HLHZ believes, and so advised the
Board of Directors of E-Stamp Corporation, that its analyses must be considered
as a whole and that selecting portions of its analyses and of the factors
considered by it, without considering all factors and analyses, could create an
incomplete view of the process underlying its analyses and opinions.

     E-Stamp retained HLHZ to render an opinion to be addressed to the Board of
Directors of E-Stamp, as to the fairness, from a financial point of view, of the
merger and related transactions disclosed to HLHZ to the stockholders of
E-Stamp. At the April 9, 2001 meeting of the Board of Directors, HLHZ presented
its analysis as hereinafter described and on April 18, 2001 delivered its
written opinion that as of such date and based on the matters described therein,
the consideration to be received by stockholders of E-Stamp in connection with
the merger is fair to them from a financial point of view.

     THE COMPLETE TEXT OF HLHZ'S OPINION IS ATTACHED HERETO AS ANNEX V. WHILE
E-STAMP BELIEVES THAT THE SUMMARY OF THE OPINION SET FORTH BELOW HIGHLIGHTS THE
MATERIAL TERMS OF THE OPINION, E-STAMP STOCKHOLDERS ARE URGED TO READ SUCH
OPINION CAREFULLY IN ITS ENTIRETY FOR A DESCRIPTION OF THE PROCEDURES FOLLOWED,
THE FACTORS CONSIDERED AND THE ASSUMPTIONS MADE BY HLHZ.

     HLHZ's opinion to the Board of Directors addresses only the fairness from a
financial point of view of the merger, and does not constitute a recommendation
to the stockholders as to how such stockholder should vote on the merger. HLHZ's
opinion does not address E-Stamp's underlying business decision to effect the
merger. HLHZ has not been requested to, and did not, solicit third party
indications of interest in acquiring all or any part of the E-Stamp.

     In connection with the preparation of its opinion, HLHZ made such reviews,
analyses and inquiries as they deemed necessary and appropriate under the
circumstances. Among other things, HLHZ:

          1. reviewed E-Stamp's audited financial statements on Form 10-K for
     the fiscal year ended December 31, 2000, which management has indicated
     represented the latest financial statements available at that time;

          2. reviewed E-Stamp's financial projections for the fiscal year ended
     December 31, 2001;

          3. reviewed E-Stamp's merger analysis regarding the costs of
     discontinuing its operations;

          4. reviewed the Presentation to the Board of Directors of E-Stamp by
     Credit Suisse First Boston, dated March 26, 2001;

          5. reviewed Learn2's audited financial statements on Form 10-K for the
     fiscal year ended December 31, 1999 and its unaudited financial statements
     on Form 10-Q for the period ended September 30, 2000;

          6. reviewed Learn2's draft financial statements on its draft Form 10-K
     for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2000, which management has indicated
     represented the latest financial information available at that time;

          7. reviewed Learn2's internal projected financial forecasts prepared
     by management of Learn2, for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2001
     through 2002;

          8. reviewed copies of the following documents relating to the merger:

             (i) the Agreement and Plan of Merger by and among E-Stamp
        Corporation and Learn2.com, Inc., draft dated April 17, 2001;

             (ii) draft of the Learn2 Disclosure Letter, distributed on April
        18, 2001;

             (iii) the Agreement by and among Learn2.com, Inc., E-Stamp
        Corporation and RGC International Investors, LDC, draft dated April 11,
        2001, regarding the Convertible Debt;

             (iv) the Convertible Promissory Note by and between E-Stamp and
        Learn2, draft dated April 13, 2001;

             (v) the Option Agreement by and between Learn2.com, Inc. and
        E-Stamp Corporation, draft dated April 17, 2001;

          9. interviewed certain senior management of E-Stamp and Learn2 to
     discuss the operations, financial condition, future prospects and projected
     performance of E-Stamp and Learn2;

          10. reviewed the historical market prices and trading volume for
     E-Stamp's and Learn2's publicly traded securities;

          11. reviewed the trading values and financial condition of certain
     public companies deemed comparable to Learn2; and

          12. conducted such other studies, analyses and inquiries as HLHZ
     deemed appropriate.

     In assessing the financial fairness of the merger to stockholders of
E-Stamp, HLHZ: (i) analyzed the historical trading prices of E-Stamp common
stock and Learn2 common stock, (ii) independently valued the equity of Learn2
using widely accepted valuation methodologies, and (iii) reviewed the valuation
implications to stockholders of E-Stamp of the merger and various alternatives
to the merger.

Analysis and Valuation of Learn2 Common Stock

     As part of its valuation analysis of the common stock of Learn2, HLHZ
analyzed the float and trading volume for Learn2's common stock. HLHZ calculated
the public float as a percent of total shares outstanding. In addition, HLHZ
calculated the ratio of average daily trading volume (over the most recent

90 days) to float and total shares outstanding. HLHZ then compared Learn2's
ratios to the same ratios for publicly traded companies that HLHZ deemed
comparable to Learn2. These comparable companies included Digital Think, Inc.,
Docent, Inc., HealthStream, Inc., Plato Learning, Inc., Saba Software, Inc.,
SkillSoft Corporation, and SmartForce Plc. HLHZ noted that Learn2 has a slightly
higher percentage of public float to shares outstanding relative to the
comparable companies, and that Learn2's average daily trading volume as a
percentage of public float was below the mean and median for the comparable
companies.

     On April 6, 2001, the last trading day before HLHZ's April 9th presentation
to the Board of Directors of E-Stamp, Learn2's common stock was trading at $0.23
per share, 92% below its 52 week high of $3.03 per share on July 20, 2000. The
stock prices of most of the comparable companies experienced similar declines in
trading prices within the prior 52 weeks.

     HLHZ analyzed Learn2's potential intermediate-term trading price based on
its current trading price as well as by comparing it to the comparable public
companies. Because a number of the companies, including Learn2, are not
profitable on an operating basis HLHZ measured multiples of revenues, and gross
profit. HLHZ computed multiples for the latest twelve months, latest quarter
annualized, projected 2001 fiscal year and projected 2002 fiscal year.

     HLHZ also analyzed the cash position and cash burn rate of Learn2 and the
comparable companies. It was observed that many of the companies have relatively
large cash balances compared to their revenues and compared to their other
assets. To account for this HLHZ calculated multiples on an enterprise value
basis and a company value basis. The company value assumes that the current
stock price reflects all of the assets of a company, including its cash balance.
Enterprise value is equal to company value less cash, and is an indication of
the value of the operations of a company, excluding its cash.

     The following table illustrates the company value and enterprise value of
each of the comparable companies and of Learn2 as of April 6, 2001:

     Based on its analysis, HLHZ concluded that the company value indications
were more relevant than enterprise value in determining trading multiples of
revenue and gross profit for the comparable companies and for Learn2. The
multiples of company value to the last twelve month revenue of the comparable
companies ranged from 2.2 times revenue to 21.3 times revenue, with a median of
9.3 times revenue. Similarly, the multiples for the comparable companies based
on latest quarter annualized revenues ranged from 1.6 to 12.7 times revenue,
with a median of 6.4 times revenue.

     The multiples of company value of last twelve month gross profit of the
comparable companies ranged from 2.8 times gross profit to 81.8 times gross
profit, with a median of 11.1 times gross profit. Similarly, the multiples for
the comparable companies based on latest quarter annualized gross profit ranged
from 2.7 to 21.4 times gross profit, with a median of 8.1 times gross profit.

     The April 6, 2001 trading price of Learn2 indicates that, both on a
multiple of revenue and a multiple of gross profit, it was trading below the low
end of the range of the comparable companies. This analysis indicated that
Learn2 was potentially undervalued, reflecting, in part, its need for additional
funding and uncertainty regarding the dilution impact of its convertible debt.
HLHZ independently valued Learn2,

assuming the liquidity issue and uncertainty regarding the convertible debt are
settled. HLHZ valued Learn2 based on the low end of the range of trading
multiples of historical and projected revenue and gross profit for the
comparable companies. HLHZ selected these multiples based on a risk analysis of
Learn2 compared to the comparable companies. The factors that were considered in
the risk analysis included historical and projected revenue growth and earnings
levels, expected cash requirements or cash generation, and market liquidity and
trading levels. HLHZ's independent valuation of Learn2 indicated that Learn2's
stock could potentially trade up to a company value in the range of $34 million
to $42 million, compared to the $22.4 million implied by the $0.23 per share
trading price. Pro forma for the merger, in which current E-Stamp stockholders
will own 50.1% of the combined company, this implies a value per E-Stamp share
in the range of $0.44 to $0.55 per share, a premium to its recent $0.23 per
share price.

Fairness Analysis

     To determine the fairness of the merger to the stockholders of E-Stamp from
a financial point of view HLHZ compared the value of the consideration be
received in the merger by the stockholders of E-Stamp to the value of the most
likely alternatives to the merger. The alternatives HLHZ considered included (i)
a liquidation scenario, and (ii) a status quo scenario in which E-Stamp
continued to operate its existing business as an independent company.

     In considering a liquidation scenario, HLHZ reviewed with E-Stamp
management, its estimate of the costs to wind down its operations, liquidate its
assets and settle its obligations and contingent liabilities, the risks
associated with such activities, and the timing of the distribution to
stockholders of the remaining cash. Based on this analysis, HLHZ estimated that,
the present value of the net cash liquidation proceeds was reasonably stated in
the range of $8.5 million to $13.4 million or $0.22 to $0.35 per share. Although
the liquidation value per share reflects a premium to the trading price of
E-Stamp's common stock on April 6, 2001, the last trading day before HLHZ's
presentation to the board of directors of E-Stamp, such liquidation value is
less than the value the merger is likely to create for E-Stamp stockholders.

     In considering the status quo alternative, HLHZ considered E-Stamp common
stock's recent trading price and E-Stamp management's 2001 business plan. On
April 6, 2001, the last trading day before HLHZ's presentation to the board of
directors of E-Stamp, the common stock of E-Stamp was trading at $0.08 per
share. This price reflected a significant discount to the cash on the balance
sheet of E-Stamp, and a discount to its liquidation value, as discussed above,
implying a negative value for the operations of E-Stamp. Based on management's
projections for E-Stamp's stand-alone operations and on E-Stamp's recent trading
history, HLHZ determined that under a status quo scenario, it was unlikely that
E-Stamp's common stock would trade at or above its liquidation value in the
foreseeable future. Furthermore, it was likely that E-Stamp would be delisted
from the NASDAQ stock market's national market in a status quo scenario.

     HLHZ has relied upon and assumed, without independent verification, that
the financial forecasts and projections provided to them have been reasonably
prepared and reflect the best currently available estimates of the future
financial results and condition of E-Stamp and Learn2, respectively, and that
there has been no material change in the assets, financial condition, business
or prospects of either E-Stamp or Learn2 since the date of the most recent
financial statements made available to them. HLHZ did not identify in its
analysis any specific factors that did not support its ability to render a
fairness opinion.

     HLHZ did not independently verify the accuracy and completeness of the
information supplied to them with respect to E-Stamp or Learn2 and did not
assume any responsibility with respect to it. HLHZ has not made any physical
inspection or independent appraisal of any of the properties or assets of
E-Stamp or Learn2. HLHZ's opinion is necessarily based on business, economic,
market and other conditions as they exist and can be evaluated by them at the
date of their letter.

     HLHZ is a nationally recognized investment banking firm with special
expertise in, among other things, valuing businesses and securities and
rendering fairness opinions. HLHZ is continually engaged in the valuation of
businesses and securities in connection with mergers and acquisitions, leveraged
buyouts,

private placements of debt and equity, corporate reorganizations, employee stock
ownership plans, corporate and other purposes. E-Stamp selected HLHZ because of
its experience and expertise in performing valuation and fairness analysis. HLHZ
does not beneficially own nor has it ever beneficially owned any interest in
E-Stamp or Learn2.

     HLHZ and E-Stamp do not currently intend for HLHZ to update or revise its
fairness opinion prior to completion of the merger. If a material amendment is
made to the merger agreement, or if a significant event occurs prior to the
completion of the merger, the E-Stamp board of directors will consider whether
or not to request that HLHZ update its fairness opinion. E-Stamp is not aware of
any significant events or changes that have occurred which could or would alter
the fairness determination.

Fees and Expenses

     Pursuant to an agreement dated March 28, 2001, HLHZ was retained by E-Stamp
to analyze the fairness of the consideration to be received by stockholders of
E-Stamp in connection with the merger, from a financial point of view. E-Stamp
has agreed to pay HLHZ a fee of $400,000 plus its reasonable out-of-pocket
expenses incurred in connection with the rendering of a fairness opinion.
E-Stamp has further agreed to indemnify HLHZ against certain liabilities and
expenses in connection with the rendering of its services.

CONFLICTS OF INTERESTS OF LEARN2 AND E-STAMP OFFICERS AND DIRECTORS IN THE
MERGER

     In considering the boards of directors' recommendations that you approve
the merger and the merger agreement, you should note that the officers and
directors have interests in the merger that are different from, or in addition
to, your interests. Specifically, as a result of or in connection with the
merger:

     - Robert H. Ewald will be the Chairman of the Board of E-Stamp;

     - Donald Schupak will become Chairman of the Executive Committee of the
       Board of E-Stamp;

     - Learn2 directors Donald Schupak, Stephen P. Gott, S. Lee Kling and James
       A. Cannavino will become directors of E-Stamp;

     - Robert H. Ewald, Marcelo Gumucio, Robert J. Cresci, John V. Balen and
       Rebecca Saeger will continue as directors of E-Stamp after the merger;

     - Learn2 officers Stephen P. Gott and Marc E. Landy will become executive
       officers of E-Stamp;

     - Stock options issued to Stephen P. Gott and Marc E. Landy exercisable to
       purchase 333,334 and 375,000, respectively, shares of Learn2 common stock
       at exercise prices ranging from $0.47 to $4.00 per share may become fully
       vested;

     - Learn2 directors and executive officers will have the right to continued
       indemnification and insurance coverage by E-Stamp for acts and omissions
       occurring prior to the merger;

     - Robert H. Ewald and Marcelo Gumucio will continue to receive salaries of
       approximately $290,000 and $120,000, respectively, after the merger;

     - The loans provided by E-Stamp to Robert H. Ewald and Marcelo Gumucio,
       having outstanding balances of approximately $290,000 and $90,000,
       respectively, should be forgiven in their entirety prior to the merger,
       together with a tax gross up on the forgiveness;

     - E-Stamp will pay Robert H. Ewald a cash bonus of $200,000 upon completion
       of the merger;

     - E-Stamp will pay Edward F. Malysz a cash bonus of $100,000 upon
      completion of the merger; and

     - Stock options exercised through the issuance of notes by Messrs. Schupak,
       Cannavino and Ezrin will be repriced from $2.00, $2.00 and a weighted
       average of $2.14, respectively, per share to $0.01, $0.71 and $0.67,
       respectively, per share and the notes issued by such directors in the
       principal

       amounts of $1,194,000, $286,667 and $206,667, respectively, will be
       cancelled and any liens thereunder released.

     Upon the closing of the merger, certain of then outstanding Learn2 stock
options, by their terms, may become vested. However, the board of directors of
Learn2 approved a plan under which each director, officer and employee would be
given the opportunity to exchange their existing stock options for new stock
options with an exercise price of $0.25 per share, subject to a new vesting
scheduled that will be approved by E-Stamp and Learn2. As a result, E-Stamp and
Learn2 are in the process of discussing appropriate vesting schedules and other
matters concerning the Learn2 stock options.

     Pursuant to the terms of the merger agreement, each Learn2 employee stock
option outstanding immediately prior to the completion of the merger will be
converted, upon completion of the merger, into an option to acquire, on the same
terms and conditions, the number of shares of E-Stamp common stock that is equal
to the aggregate number of shares of Learn2 shares of common stock for which
such option was exercisable multiplied by the exchange ratio.

     For six years after completion of the merger, E-Stamp will indemnify each
current and former officer or director of Learn2 to the extent required under
Delaware law or Learn2's certificate of incorporation or bylaws in effect
immediately prior to the completion of the merger.

     In addition, Learn2's directors and officers will receive, for a period of
six years after the completion of the merger, directors' and officers' insurance
coverage with terms substantially the same as those of Learn2's existing
directors and officers insurance policy for events occurring on or prior to the
completion of the merger through one of the following mechanisms:

     - a directors and officers insurance policy whose annual premium is not
       greater than 200% of the premium of Learn2's policy in effect on the date
       of the merger agreement; or

     - obtaining "tail" coverage under Learn2's existing directors and officers
       insurance policy.

     As a result, Learn2's and E-Stamp's directors and officers generally could
be more likely to vote to approve the merger and the merger agreement than
Learn2 and E-Stamp stockholders.

MATERIAL U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSEQUENCES OF THE MERGER

     In the opinion of Wilson Sonsini Goodrich & Rosati, Professional
Corporation, tax counsel to E-Stamp, the following are the material U.S. federal
income tax consequences of the merger to holders of Learn2 common stock who,
pursuant to the merger, exchange their Learn2 common stock for E-Stamp common
stock, assuming that the merger is effected as described in the merger agreement
and in this joint proxy statement-prospectus. This discussion is based on
existing provisions of the Internal Revenue Code, currently applicable Treasury
regulations, and current administrative rulings and court decisions, all of
which are subject to change, possibly with retroactive effect.

     This discussion does not address all U.S. federal income tax considerations
that may be relevant to you in light of your particular circumstances. Factors
that could alter the tax consequences of the merger to you include:

     - if you are a dealer or trader in securities;

     - if you are subject to the alternative minimum tax provisions of the
       Internal Revenue Code;

     - if you are not a U.S. citizen or resident;

     - if your functional currency is not the U.S. dollar;

     - if you are a tax-exempt organization, financial institution or insurance
       company;

     - if you acquired your shares in connection with stock option or stock
       purchase plans or in other compensatory transactions; or

     - if you hold Learn2 common stock as part of a hedge, straddle, or other
       integrated, risk reduction, constructive sale, or conversion transaction.

     This discussion does not address the tax consequences of an exchange of
options or warrants for Learn2 common stock into options or warrants for E-Stamp
common stock. This discussion assumes you hold your shares of Learn2 common
stock as capital assets within the meaning of Section 1221 of the Internal
Revenue Code.

     In the opinion of Wilson Sonsini Goodrich & Rosati, Professional
Corporation, the merger should qualify as a reorganization within the meaning of
Section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code. This opinion is subject to certain
limitations, qualifications and assumptions and is based on certain facts and
representations, including representations contained in certificates executed by
officers of E-Stamp and Learn2. The opinion assumes the absence of changes in
relevant facts or law between the date of this joint proxy statement-prospectus
and the closing date of the merger and assumes that the merger is effected as
described in the merger agreement and in this joint proxy statement-prospectus.
The opinion is not binding on the Internal Revenue Service or the courts. No
ruling from the Internal Revenue Service has been or will be sought.

     The following material federal income tax consequences will result from the
merger's qualification as a reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a)
of the Internal Revenue Code:

     - You will not recognize any gain or loss upon your receipt of E-Stamp
       common stock solely in exchange for your shares of Learn2 common stock in
       the merger.

     - The aggregate tax basis of the E-Stamp common stock received by you as a
       result of the merger will be approximately the same as the aggregate tax
       basis of the Learn2 common stock you surrender in the merger.

     - The holding period of the E-Stamp common stock received by you in the
       merger will include the period during which you held the Learn2 common
       stock exchanged therefor.

     - Learn2 will not recognize gain or loss as a result of the transfer of its
       assets to E-Stamp in the merger solely in exchange for E-Stamp common
       stock.

     - E-Stamp will not recognize gain or loss as a result of the receipt of the
       assets of Learn2 in the merger in exchange for the issuance of its common
       stock.

     If the Internal Revenue Service were to challenge successfully the status
of the merger as a reorganization, the tax consequences to you described above
would not, in general, apply and you would be required to recognize gain or loss
as a result of the merger in an amount equal to the difference between your
basis in your Learn2 common stock and the fair market value, as of the closing
of the merger, of the shares of E-Stamp common stock and any other consideration
that you receive. Learn2 would also be required to recognize gain on the
transfer of its assets to E-Stamp as a result of the merger.

     Even if the merger qualifies as a reorganization, you could recognize gain
to the extent that shares of E-Stamp common stock are considered to be received
in exchange for services or property, other than solely for Learn2 common stock.
All or a portion of such gain may be taxable as ordinary income. You may also
recognize gain to the extent that you are treated as receiving, directly or
indirectly, consideration other than E-Stamp common stock in exchange for your
Learn2 common stock.

     LOSS OF NET OPERATING LOSS CARRYFORWARDS.  Learn2 and E-Stamp expect that
the merger will result in an ownership change of Learn2 under Section 382 of the
Internal Revenue Code. Section 382 contains rules that limit the ability of a
company to offset pre-ownership change net operating losses and credit
carryovers against post-ownership change taxable income. As a result, Learn2's
net operating loss carryforwards, aggregating approximately $100 million as of
December 31, 2000, will be limited for use to offset any income of E-Stamp.
E-Stamp's net operating losses, aggregating approximately $133.6 million as of
December 31, 2000, will be limited now or in the future, depending upon the
transactions involving E-Stamp common stock.

     THE FOREGOING DISCUSSION IS NOT INTENDED TO BE A COMPLETE ANALYSIS OR
DESCRIPTION OF ALL POTENTIAL UNITED STATES FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSEQUENCES OF
THE MERGER. IN PARTICULAR, THE DISCUSSION DOES NOT ADDRESS TAX CONSEQUENCES
WHICH MAY VARY WITH YOUR INDIVIDUAL CIRCUMSTANCES. MOREOVER, THE DISCUSSION DOES
NOT ADDRESS ANY NON-INCOME TAX OR ANY FOREIGN, STATE OR LOCAL TAX CONSEQUENCES
OF THE MERGER. ACCORDINGLY, WE STRONGLY URGE YOU TO CONSULT YOUR OWN TAX ADVISOR
AS TO THE SPECIFIC UNITED STATES FEDERAL, STATE, LOCAL OR FOREIGN INCOME OR
OTHER TAX CONSEQUENCES OF THE MERGER TO YOU.

LISTING ON THE NASDAQ NATIONAL MARKET OF E-STAMP COMMON STOCK TO BE ISSUED IN
THE MERGER

     E-Stamp intends to have the shares of E-Stamp common stock to be issued in
the merger approved for listing on the Nasdaq National Market before the
completion of the merger. There can be no assurance, however, that E-Stamp's
common stock will be listed on the Nasdaq National Market at the effective time
of the merger or at any time thereafter. See "Risk Factors -- We May Lose Our
Listing on the Nasdaq Stock Market."

DELISTING AND DEREGISTRATION OF LEARN2 COMMON STOCK AFTER THE MERGER

     When the merger is completed, Learn2 common stock will be delisted from the
Nasdaq National Market and will be deregistered under the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934, as amended.

DISSENTERS' RIGHTS

     No dissenters' or appraisal rights are available in connection with the
merger.

ACCOUNTING TREATMENT

     E-Stamp intends to account for the merger as a purchase for financial
reporting and accounting purposes, under accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States of America. After the merger, the results of
operations of Learn2 will be included in the consolidated financial statements
of E-Stamp. The purchase price will be allocated based on the fair values of the
assets acquired and the liabilities assumed.

     E-Stamp will be the accounting acquirer in the merger. E-Stamp is the
accounting acquirer based on the guidance provided in SEC Staff Accounting
Bulletin No. 24, Topic 2A. Some of the factors considered to determine that
E-Stamp is the accounting acquirer are as follows:

     - Upon the completion of the merger, holders of E-Stamp common stock
      immediately prior to the merger will hold approximately 50.1%, and the
      former holders of Learn2's common stock, including the holder of Learn2's
      $10 million convertible debenture, will hold approximately 49.9% of the
      combined company.

     - The combined company's board of directors will be controlled by existing
      board members of E-Stamp in a ratio of 5 to 4.

     - E-Stamp's structure of a classified board will remain for the combined
      company, based on the expiration dates of the remaining E-Stamp director's
      terms, former E-Stamp directors will be up for election as directors of
      the combined company as follows: 2001 - 1; 2002 - 2 2003 - 2.

     - The former Chief Executive Officer of E-Stamp will become Chairman of the
      Board of Directors of the combined company.

     - The former Chief Executive Officer of E-Stamp will assume the role of
      Executive Chairman and thus the most senior member of the combined
      company's executive management team.

     - In connection with the merger, E-Stamp loaned Learn2 $2 million.

     The cost of the acquisition is expected to be less than the fair value of
the net tangible assets of Learn2 acquired. The deficiency will be allocated
first to reduce proportionately the values assigned to

non-current assets. Should non-current assets be reduced to zero, any remaining
deficiency will be recorded as a deferred credit and amortized to income over
the expected period of benefit.

MARKET PRICE INFORMATION

     The following table sets forth, for the quarters indicated, the high and
low closing prices per share of E-Stamp common stock and Learn2 common stock as
reported on the Nasdaq National Market. E-Stamp common stock began trading on
the Nasdaq National Market on October 8, 1999, and Learn2 common stock began
trading on the Nasdaq National Market on October 20, 1994.

     The foregoing table shows only historical comparisons. These comparisons
may not provide meaningful information to you in determining whether to approve
the merger and the merger agreement. Because the proportion of shares of E-Stamp
to be issued to the holders of Learn2 common stock is fixed, changes in the
market price of E-Stamp common stock will affect the dollar value of E-Stamp
common stock to be received by stockholders of Learn2 in the merger. Learn2
stockholders are urged to obtain current market quotations for E-Stamp common
stock, and to review carefully the other information contained in this joint
proxy statement-prospectus, prior to considering whether to approve the merger
and the merger agreement.

     As of          , 2001, E-Stamp estimates that there were approximately
               holders of record of E-Stamp common stock. To date, E-Stamp has
not declared or paid dividends on its common stock. The board of directors of
E-Stamp does not anticipate declaring or paying any cash dividends in the
foreseeable future.

     As of          , 2001, Learn2 estimates that there were approximately
               holders of record of Learn2 common stock. To date, Learn2 has not
declared or paid dividends on its common stock. The Board of Directors of Learn2
presently intends to retain all earnings for use in Learn2's business and
therefore does not anticipate declaring or paying any cash dividends in the
foreseeable future.

                              THE MERGER AGREEMENT

     The following summary highlights selected information from the merger
agreement, which is incorporated by reference and attached as Annex I to this
joint proxy statement-prospectus. This summary may not contain all the
information that is important to you. We urge you to read the full text of the
merger agreement.

CERTIFICATE OF INCORPORATION AND BYLAWS OF E-STAMP AFTER THE MERGER

     At the closing of the merger, the certificate of incorporation and the
bylaws of E-Stamp will remain the certificate of incorporation and the bylaws of
the surviving corporation. However, the certificate of incorporation of the
surviving corporation will be amended so that the name of the surviving
corporation shall be Learn2 Corporation.

DIRECTORS AND OFFICERS OF E-STAMP AFTER THE MERGER

     At the closing of the merger:

     - Robert H. Ewald will be the Chairman of the Board of E-Stamp;

     - Donald Schupak will become Chairman of the Executive Committee of the
       Board of E-Stamp;

     - Learn2 directors Donald Schupak, Stephen P. Gott, S. Lee Kling and James
       A. Cannavino will become directors of E-Stamp;

     - Robert H. Ewald, Marcelo Gumucio, Robert J. Cresci, John V. Balen and
       Rebecca Saeger will continue as directors of E-Stamp after the merger;

     - Stephen P. Gott will become the President and Chief Executive Officer of
       E-Stamp; and

     - Marc E. Landy will become the Executive Vice President, Chief Financial
       Officer, Secretary and Treasurer of E-Stamp.

CONVERSION OF LEARN2 CAPITAL STOCK

     At the closing of the merger, each share of common stock of Learn2 issued
and outstanding immediately prior to the merger will be automatically converted
into the right to receive the number of shares of E-Stamp common stock
calculated pursuant to the exchange ratio, rounded to the nearest whole share.
No fractional shares of E-Stamp common stock will be issued in the merger. The
exchange ratio will equal the quotient obtained by dividing (i) 99.5% of the
number of outstanding shares of E-Stamp common stock by (ii) the number of
outstanding shares of Learn2 common stock. For purposes of the exchange ratio,
outstanding shares of both E-Stamp and Learn2 common stock, including shares
issuable to Learn2's convertible debenture holder, will include options that
will be vested as of the closing of the merger and have an exercise price that
is less than or equal to the average closing price of E-Stamp or Learn2 common
stock, respectively, for the five consecutive trading days immediately preceding
the E-Stamp or Learn2 special meeting, respectively.

PROCEDURE FOR EXCHANGING LEARN2 COMMON STOCK FOR E-STAMP COMMON STOCK

     The merger agreement requires E-Stamp to designate an exchange agent for
the benefit of holders of shares of Learn2 common stock to hold certificates
representing the shares of E-Stamp common stock to be issued in the merger. When
the merger is completed, the exchange agent will mail to you a letter of
transmittal and instructions for surrendering your Learn2 stock certificates in
exchange for E-Stamp stock certificates and any dividends or distributions that
may be issuable.

LEARN2 OPTIONS

     The merger agreement provides that all options outstanding at the closing
of the merger to purchase shares of Learn2 common stock will be assumed by
E-Stamp and become options to purchase common stock of E-Stamp, subject to
adjustment according to the exchange ratio.

LEARN2 NON-SOLICITATION

     Learn2 has agreed to cease, as of the date of the merger agreement, any and
all existing activities, discussions or negotiations with any parties conducted
prior to that date with respect to any "Acquisition Proposal," other than an
offer or proposal from E-Stamp.

     An Acquisition Proposal is any offer to acquire, directly or indirectly,
15% or more of the assets of an entity and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole,
or of the capital stock of an entity, whether by asset sale, tender offer,
exchange offer, merger, consolidation, liquidation, dissolution or similar
transaction.

     Until the merger is completed or the merger agreement is terminated, Learn2
has agreed that neither it nor any of its subsidiaries directly or indirectly
will:

     - encourage, solicit or facilitate any inquiries or proposals that
       constitute or could reasonably be expected to lead to an Acquisition
       Proposal relating to Learn2; or

     - participate in any discussions or negotiations or provide any information
       relating to any Acquisition Proposal relating to Learn2.

     The merger agreement provides that these restrictions shall not prohibit
Learn2 from complying with Rule 14e-2 promulgated under the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934, as amended. Moreover, the merger

agreement allows Learn2 to participate in discussions or negotiations with, or
furnish information regarding Learn2 pursuant to a confidentiality agreement to,
any person or group if all of the following conditions are met:

     - the person or group has submitted a superior proposal to Learn2's board
       of directors;

     - neither Learn2 nor any of its representatives or subsidiaries has
       breached the non-solicitation provisions contained in the merger
       agreement in connection with the superior proposal;

     - the board of directors of Learn2 determines in its good faith judgment,
       after consultation with its legal counsel, that taking such action is
       necessary to comply with its fiduciary duties under applicable law; and

     - the board of directors of Learn2 provides prior written notice to E-Stamp
       of its decision to participate in negotiations and provide information.

     A superior proposal is any proposal or offer made by a third party to
acquire, directly or indirectly, including pursuant to a sale of assets, tender
offer, exchange offer, merger, consolidation, business combination,
recapitalization, liquidation, dissolution or similar transaction, for
consideration consisting of cash and/or securities, more than 50% of the
combined voting power of the capital stock of an entity then outstanding or all
or substantially all of the assets of an entity and otherwise on terms which its
board of directors determines in good faith judgment (after consultation with
its financial advisor), to be more favorable to its stockholders than the merger
and which is not subject to the receipt of any necessary financing or which, in
the good faith judgment of its board of directors, is reasonably capable of
being obtained by such third party.

     Learn2 has agreed to inform E-Stamp orally and in writing promptly of any
Acquisition Proposal relating to Learn2 and any request for non-public
information in connection with an Acquisition Proposal relating to Learn2. The
notice shall include the identity of the person making the proposal, inquiry or
contact as well as the material terms and conditions of such proposal, inquiry
or contact.

     Under the merger agreement, the Learn2 directors are allowed to (i)
withdraw or modify in a manner adverse to E-Stamp their recommendation in favor
of the merger, (ii) recommend another Acquisition Proposal relating to Learn2 or
(iii) enter into an agreement with respect to another Acquisition Proposal if:

     - a superior proposal is made;

     - neither Learn2 nor any of its representatives has breached the
       non-solicitation provisions of the merger agreement in connection with
       the superior proposal; and

     - the board of directors provides 2 days' prior written notice to E-Stamp
       of its intent to accept such superior proposal, specifying the material
       terms of the superior proposal and identifying the person making the
       superior proposal.

     Regardless of whether there has been a superior proposal, Learn2 is
obligated under the merger agreement to hold and convene the Learn2 special
meeting of stockholders.

E-STAMP NON-SOLICITATION

     E-Stamp has agreed to cease, as of the date of the merger agreement, any
and all existing activities, discussions or negotiations with any parties
conducted prior to that date with respect to any Acquisition Proposal, other
than an offer or proposal from E-Stamp.

     Until the merger is completed or the merger agreement is terminated,
E-Stamp has agreed that neither it nor any of its subsidiaries directly or
indirectly will:

     - encourage, solicit or facilitate any inquiries or proposals that
       constitute or could reasonably be expected to lead to an Acquisition
       Proposal relating to E-Stamp; or

     - participate in any discussions or negotiations or provide any information
       relating to any Acquisition Proposal relating to E-Stamp.

     The merger agreement provides that these restrictions shall not prohibit
E-Stamp from complying with Rule 14e-2 promulgated under the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934, as amended. Moreover, the merger agreement allows E-Stamp to
participate in discussions or negotiations with, or furnish information
regarding E-Stamp pursuant to a confidentiality agreement to, any person or
group if all of the following conditions are met:

     - the person or group has submitted a superior proposal to E-Stamp's board
       of directors;

     - neither E-Stamp nor any of its representatives or subsidiaries has
       breached the non-solicitation provisions contained in the merger
       agreement in connection with the superior proposal;

     - the board of directors of E-Stamp determines in its good faith judgment,
       after consultation with its legal counsel, that taking such action is
       necessary to comply with its fiduciary duties under applicable law; and

     - the board of directors of E-Stamp provides prior written notice to
       E-Stamp of its decision to participate in negotiations and provide
       information.

     E-Stamp has agreed to inform Learn2 orally and in writing promptly of any
Acquisition Proposal relating to E-Stamp and any request for non-public
information in connection with an Acquisition Proposal relating to E-Stamp. The
notice shall include the identity of the person making the proposal, inquiry or
contact as well as the material terms and conditions of such proposal, inquiry
or contact.

     Under the merger agreement, the E-Stamp directors are allowed to (i)
withdraw or modify in a manner adverse to Learn2 their recommendation in favor
of the merger, (ii) recommend another Acquisition Proposal relating to E-Stamp
or (iii) enter into an agreement with respect to another Acquisition Proposal
if:

     - a superior proposal is made;

     - neither E-Stamp nor any of its representatives has breached the
       non-solicitation provisions of the merger agreement in connection with
       the superior proposal; and

     - the board of directors provides 2 days' prior written notice to Learn2 of
       its intent to accept such superior proposal, specifying the material
       terms of the superior proposal and identifying the person making the
       superior proposal.

     Regardless of whether there has been a superior proposal, E-Stamp is
obligated under the merger agreement to hold and convene the E-Stamp special
meeting of stockholders.

REGISTRATION STATEMENT AND PROXY STATEMENT

     E-Stamp and Learn2 have agreed to prepare and cause to be filed with the
Securities and Exchange Commission a registration statement on Form S-4,
including this joint proxy statement-prospectus, and to cooperate and provide
promptly information to each other as required or appropriate for inclusion in
the registration statement.

LEARN2 SPECIAL MEETING OF STOCKHOLDERS

     Learn2 has agreed to convene a special meeting of Learn2 stockholders as
promptly as practicable after the registration statement on Form S-4 is declared
effective, and to use its reasonable efforts to solicit and secure from its
stockholders at the meeting the adoption and approval of the merger agreement
and the merger, as well as the issuance to the holder of Learn2's $10 million
convertible debenture, prior to the merger, of approximately 26.5 million shares
of Learn2 common stock in redemption of such debenture. Learn2 has also agreed
that its board of directors will recommend that its stockholders vote in

favor of and adopt and approve the merger agreement and the merger, and that
this recommendation will not be withdrawn or modified in a manner adverse to
E-Stamp, subject to limited exceptions.

     Nothing in the merger agreement prevents the Learn2 board of directors from
withdrawing or changing its recommendation in favor of the merger if the board
reasonably concludes in good faith, after consultation with its outside counsel,
that the failure to so withdraw or change its recommendation would be
inconsistent with its fiduciary obligations.

E-STAMP SPECIAL MEETING OF STOCKHOLDERS

     E-Stamp has agreed to convene a special meeting of E-Stamp stockholders as
promptly as practicable after the registration statement on Form S-4 is declared
effective, and to use its reasonable efforts to solicit and secure from its
stockholders at the meeting (i) the adoption and approval of the merger
agreement and the merger, including changing E-Stamp's name to Learn2
Corporation and (ii) amending its 1999 Stock Plan to increase the number of
shares reserved thereunder. E-Stamp has also agreed that its board of directors
will recommend that its stockholders vote in favor of and adopt and approve the
merger agreement and the merger, and that this recommendation will not be
withdrawn or modified in a manner adverse to Learn2, subject to limited
exceptions.

     Nothing in the merger agreement prevents the E-Stamp board of directors
from withdrawing or changing its recommendation in favor of the merger if the
board reasonably concludes in good faith, after consultation with its outside
counsel, that the failure to so withdraw or change its recommendation would be
inconsistent with its fiduciary obligations.

DIRECTORS' AND OFFICERS' INDEMNIFICATION

     For six years after completion of the merger, E-Stamp will indemnify each
current and former officer or director of Learn2 to the extent required under
Delaware law or Learn2's certificate of incorporation or bylaws in effect
immediately prior to the completion of the merger.

     In addition, Learn2's directors and officers will receive, for a period of
six years after the completion of the merger, directors' and officers' insurance
coverage with terms substantially the same as those of Learn2's existing
directors and officers insurance policy for events occurring on or prior to the
completion of the merger through one of the following mechanisms:

     - a directors and officers insurance policy whose annual premium is not
       greater than 200% of the premium of Learn2's policy in effect on the date
       of the merger agreement; or

     - obtaining "tail" coverage under Learn2's existing directors and officers
       insurance policy.

EMPLOYEE BENEFIT MATTERS

     Following the merger and for one year thereafter, E-Stamp will provide
Learn2 employees and its subsidiaries' employees with benefits plans and
arrangements that are substantially similar, in the aggregate, to those of
Learn2 as in effect immediately prior to the merger, other than with respect to
benefits not available to E-Stamp employees.

     Following the merger, each continuing employee will, to the extent
permitted by applicable law and the applicable third party provider, receive
service credit for purposes of eligibility to participate and vesting (but not
for benefit accrual purposes) for employee benefit plan purposes for service to
Learn2 or its subsidiaries prior to the merger.

OTHER COVENANTS

     The merger agreement contains other covenants relating to, among other
things:

     - redemption and termination of the convertible debenture held by RGC
       International Investors, LDC in the aggregate principal amount of $10
       million; and

     - lock-up agreements subjecting directors and executive officers to
       contractual trading restrictions regarding shares of E-Stamp common
       stock.

CONDITIONS TO COMPLETION OF THE MERGER

     The obligations of E-Stamp and Learn2 to complete the merger and the other
transactions contemplated by the merger agreement are subject to the
satisfaction of each of the following conditions before completion of the
merger:

     - the merger agreement must be approved and adopted and the merger must be
       approved by the Learn2 and E-Stamp stockholders;

     - E-Stamp's registration statement must be effective, no stop order
       suspending its effectiveness shall have been issued and no proceedings

       by the SEC; and

     - no law, regulation or order must be enacted, enforced or issued which is
       in effect and prevents or prohibits the merger.

     E-Stamp's obligations to complete the merger and the other transactions
contemplated by the merger agreement are subject to the satisfaction or waiver
of each of the following additional conditions before completion of the merger:

     - Learn2's representations and warranties must be true in all material
       respects as of April 19, 2001, and at and as of the date the merger is to
       be completed as if made at and as of such time except: to the extent
       Learn2's representations and warranties address matters only as of a
       particular date, they must be true as of that date and if any of these
       representations and warranties are not true at the time of the merger,
       but the effect in each case, or in the aggregate, while disregarding all
       qualifications based on the word "material" within the representations
       and warranties, of the inaccuracies of these representations and breaches
       of these warranties is not and does not have a material adverse effect on
       Learn2, then this condition will be deemed satisfied;

     - Learn2 must perform or comply in all material respects with all of its
       conditions, agreements, obligations and covenants required by the merger
       agreement to be performed or complied with by Learn2 at or before
       completion of the merger;

     - There shall not have occurred a material adverse effect on Learn2; and

     - Learn2 shall have issued shares of its common stock to the holder of its
       $10 million convertible debenture and the debenture shall have been
       redeemed.

     Learn2's obligations to complete the merger and the other transactions
contemplated by the merger agreement are subject to the satisfaction or waiver
of each of the following additional conditions before completion of the merger:

     - E-Stamp's representations and warranties must be true in all material
       respects as of April 19, 2001, and as of the date the merger is to be
       completed as if made at and as of such time except: to the extent
       E-Stamp's representations and warranties address matters only as of a
       particular date, they must be true and correct as of that date and if any
       of these representations and warranties are not true and correct at the
       time of the merger, but the effect in each case, or in the aggregate,
       while disregarding all qualifications based on the word "material" within
       the representations and warranties, of the inaccuracies of these
       representations and breaches of these warranties, is not and does not
       have a material adverse effect on E-Stamp, then this condition will be
       deemed satisfied;

     - E-Stamp must perform or comply in all material respects with all of its
       conditions, agreements, obligations and covenants required by the merger
       agreement to be performed or complied with by E-Stamp at or before
       completion of the merger;

     - There shall not have occurred a material adverse effect on E-Stamp;

     - E-Stamp shall have net cash of at least $13 million as determined under
       the merger agreement as of the closing of the merger, subject to
       adjustment; and

     - Learn2 stockholders holding less than ten percent of the outstanding
       Learn2 common stock shall have exercised or given notice of their intent
       to exercise dissenters' rights.

     Each of the conditions to E-Stamp's and Learn2's obligation to complete the
merger and other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement may be
waived, in whole or in part, to the extent permitted by applicable law, by
agreement of E-Stamp and Learn2. In the event a waiver is granted, the boards of
directors of E-Stamp and Learn2 will evaluate its materiality. However, we do
not expect the granting of an individual waiver to be sufficiently material to
warrant amendment and resolicitation of the joint proxy statement-prospectus.
If, for example, E-Stamp failed to satisfy the closing condition related to its
minimum cash position and Learn2 waived said condition, E-Stamp and Learn2 may
determine that the failure of condition and its subsequent waiver are not
material. Stockholders will be notified of any such waiver by a joint press
release.

TERMINATION OF THE MERGER AGREEMENT

     The merger agreement may be terminated at any time, except where otherwise
indicated, prior to completion of the merger:

     - by mutual written consent of E-Stamp and Learn2;

     - by E-Stamp or Learn2, if the merger is not completed before September 30,
       2001 for any reason, except that this right to terminate the merger
       agreement is not available to any party whose action or failure to act
       has been a principal cause of or resulted in the failure of the merger to
       occur on or before September 30, 2001 and that action or failure to act
       constitutes a breach of the merger agreement;

       of Learn2's $10 million convertible debenture in connection with the
       redemption and termination of the convertible debenture;

     - by E-Stamp or Learn2, if there is any order of a court or governmental

       met; however, E-Stamp may not terminate the merger agreement for 15 days
       after delivery of written notice from E-Stamp to Learn2 of the breach.

EXPENSES RELATED TO THE MERGER

the merger agreement, waive any inaccuracies in the other's representations and

signed by the extending or waiving party.

                               RELATED AGREEMENTS

THE PRIVATE PLACEMENT

     Pursuant to the merger agreement, E-Stamp loaned Learn2 $2 million on April
25, 2001. In connection with this loan, Learn2 issued to E-Stamp a $2 million
convertible promissory note that bears interest at 10% per annum.

     Maturity Date. The principal amount of the note, together with all accrued
and unpaid interest on the note, is due and payable on April 30, 2002. The note
provides that upon the occurrence of specified events of default, E-Stamp may
accelerate the maturity date of the note. In addition to customary events of
default relating to failure to pay the note when due and bankruptcy proceedings,
the note provides that E-Stamp may declare the principal and accrued and unpaid
interest on the note:

     - immediately due and payable if a default or event of default occurs under
       Learn2's $10 million convertible debenture, which default is not waived
       or cured within any applicable grace period, and which results in the
       acceleration of the maturity date of Learn2's $10 million convertible
       debenture;

     - immediately due and payable if the Learn2 board of directors withdraws,
       modifies or changes in a manner adverse to E-Stamp its approval or
       recommendation of the merger agreement or the merger, or recommends an
       acquisition proposal, as defined in the merger agreement, relating to
       Learn2 with any person other than E-Stamp;

     - immediately due and payable if Learn2 executes an agreement in principle
       or definitive agreement relating to an acquisition proposal, as defined
       in the merger agreement, relating to Learn2 with any person other than
       E-Stamp; and

     - due and payable sixty days after the termination of the merger agreement
       if Learn2 breaches any representation, warranty, covenant or other
       agreement contained in the merger agreement, which breach results in a
       material adverse effect, as defined in the merger agreement, on Learn2
       and cannot or has not been cured within fifteen days after the giving of
       written notice by E-Stamp to Learn2, and which results in E-Stamps
       termination of the merger agreement.

     Conversion Features. The note issued to E-Stamp is convertible at any time
into 2,000 shares of Series E preferred stock of Learn2. The Series E preferred
stock of Learn2 has a liquidation preference of $1,000 per share and is senior
to all other Learn2 equity securities. These shares of Learn2 Series E preferred
stock are convertible into Learn2 common stock at any time following the
termination of the merger agreement. These 2,000 shares of Learn2 Series E
preferred stock are initially convertible into an aggregate of 8,000,000 shares
of Learn2 common stock.

     After the earlier of (1) September 30, 2001, or any later date specified in
any amendment to the merger agreement after which either E-Stamp or Learn2 may
terminate the merger agreement if the merger has not occurred by that date, or
(2) the termination of the merger agreement as a result of the failure of Learn2
stockholders to adopt the merger agreement and approve the merger or as a result
of Learn2's breach of the merger agreement or the documents related to the
merger agreement, the conversion ratio shall be adjusted such that each share of
Learn2 Series E preferred stock shall be convertible into that number of shares
of Learn2 common stock determined by dividing $1,000 by the lesser of (1) $0.25
and (2) the average closing sales price of the Learn2 common stock for the five
trading days immediately prior to the date of conversion. However, the
conversion ratio shall not be adjusted to a ratio that requires approval of
Learn2 stockholders under any applicable law or rule, including the rules of The
Nasdaq Stock Market, until such approval, or exemption therefrom shall have been
obtained by Learn2.

     On all matters submitted to a vote of Learn2 stockholders, each share of
Learn2 Series E preferred stock is entitled to the same number of votes as the
number of shares of Learn2 common stock into which such share of Learn2 Series E
preferred stock is then convertible.

     Restrictions on Transfer. The note and the shares of Learn2 Series E
preferred stock issuable upon the conversion of the note are not transferable
prior to the termination of the merger agreement.

     Registration Rights. E-Stamp is entitled to rights with respect to the
registration under the Securities Act of the shares of Learn2 common stock
issuable to E-Stamp upon conversion of the Learn2 Series E preferred stock
issuable upon conversion of the note. These rights are provided under the terms
of a registration rights agreement between Learn2 and E-Stamp entered into in
connection with the issuance of the note. Learn2 has agreed to register such
shares for public resale by filing a registration statement with

the SEC within 120 days after termination of the merger agreement. Learn2 has
also agreed to keep the foregoing registration statement effective at all times
until such shares of Learn2 common stock have been sold or such shares may, in
the reasonable opinion of E-Stamp's counsel, may be immediately sold to the
public without registration or restriction, including without any volume
limitations. Furthermore, in the event Learn2 elects to register any of its
shares of common stock for purposes of effecting any public offering, E-Stamp is
entitled to include the shares of Learn2 common stock issued upon conversion of
the Learn2 Series E preferred stock in the registration, but Learn2 may reduce
the number of shares proposed to be registered in view of market conditions. The
registration rights agreement also provides that E-Stamp has specified rights to
require that Learn2 list the Learn2 shares acquired by E-Stamp upon conversion
of the note on The Nasdaq Stock Market or other national securities exchange or
trading system on which shares of Learn2's common stock are listed for trading
or quotation.

LETTER AGREEMENT

     The following summary highlights selected information from the letter
agreement, the complete text of which is incorporated by reference and included
as an exhibit to the registration statement of which this joint proxy
statement-prospectus forms a part. The summary may not contain all of the
information that is important to you. We urge you to read the full text of the
letter agreement.

     In connection with the merger agreement, Learn2 and E-Stamp entered into a
letter agreement. The letter agreement provides that Learn2, and not E-Stamp,
shall be the surviving corporation in the merger if prior to the record date for
the E-Stamp special meeting:

     - E-Stamp's common stock is delisted from The Nasdaq National Market; and

     - Learn2's common stock continues to be listed on The Nasdaq National
       Market on such date.

     Although under the limited circumstances described above, Learn2, and not
E-Stamp, would be the surviving corporation in the merger, the exchange ratio in
the merger would continue to provide for Learn2 stockholders, including the
holder of Learn2's $10 million convertible debenture, immediately prior to the
merger to hold approximately 49.9%, and for E-Stamp stockholders immediately
prior to the merger to hold approximately 50.1%, of the combined company. The
other terms of the merger agreement, including the provisions governing the
composition of the board of directors of the surviving corporation, would remain
in effect except that E-Stamp and Learn2 have agreed to amend the merger
agreement as necessary to reflect Learn2 as the surviving corporation of the
merger should the circumstances described above occur. If any such amendment is
entered into, E-Stamp and Learn2 would resolicit stockholder approval for the
merger.

LOCK-UP AGREEMENTS OF E-STAMP DIRECTORS AND EXECUTIVE OFFICERS FOLLOWING THE
MERGER

     E-Stamp and Learn2 each intend for the persons who will serve as executive
officers and directors of E-Stamp following the merger to enter into lock-up
agreements restricting those persons' ability to dispose of E-Stamp common
stock. Generally, these lock-up agreements will prohibit the sale of E-Stamp
common stock for the six months following the merger and will impose specified
limitations on sales occurring after such six month period and prior to the one
year anniversary of the merger. These prohibitions will terminate at such time
as the individual ceases to be an officer or director of E-Stamp, except with
respect to Messrs. Schupak and Gott whose obligations under the lock-up
agreements will continue notwithstanding any earlier termination of their
services to E-Stamp. RGC's agreement to similar trading limitations on the
shares of E-Stamp common stock it will receive in the merger is contingent upon
each person who will serve as an executive officer or director of E-Stamp
following the merger entering into these lock-up agreements. However, we cannot
assure you that each of these persons will enter into a lock-up agreement. In
the event that any of these persons do not agree to a lock-up agreement, the
contractual restrictions on RGC's ability to sell E-Stamp common stock received
by RGC in the merger will terminate.

VOTING AGREEMENTS

The following summary highlights selected information from the voting
agreements, the complete text of which are incorporated by reference and
attached as annexes III and IV to this joint proxy statement-prospectus. The
summary may not contain all of the information that is important to you. We urge
you to read the full text of the voting agreements.

     In connection with the execution and delivery of the merger agreement,
Learn2 entered into a voting agreement with each of the executive officers and
directors of E-Stamp, and E-Stamp entered into a voting agreement with each of
the executive officers and directors of Learn2.

     Under these voting agreements, each of the executive officers and directors
of E-Stamp and Learn2 agreed to vote all their shares of E-Stamp and Learn2
common stock in favor of the merger and adoption of the merger agreement,
against approval or adoption of resolutions or actions which would cause the
conditions to closing of the merger, as set forth in the merger agreement, not
to be satisfied and against other specified matters. The executive officers and
directors of E-Stamp and Learn2 may vote their shares of E-Stamp and Learn2
common stock on all other matters.

     As of the record date for the E-Stamp special meeting, the E-Stamp
executive officers and directors owned shares of E-Stamp common stock
representing approximately      % of the total voting power of the outstanding
shares of E-Stamp common stock.

     As of the record date for the Learn2 special meeting, the Learn2 executive
officer and directors owned shares of Learn2 common stock representing
approximately      % of the total voting power of the outstanding shares of
Learn2 common stock.

     The voting agreements generally prohibit the executive officers and
directors of E-Stamp and Learn2 from selling, transferring, pledging,
encumbering, assigning or otherwise disposing of any shares of E-Stamp common
stock, except to a person who agrees in writing to be bound by the terms of the
voting agreement and except for transfers that do not prevent the stockholder
from performing his or her obligations under the voting agreements.

     The voting agreements terminate upon the earlier to occur of the completion
of the merger and the termination of the merger agreement in accordance with its
terms.

                          UNAUDITED PRO FORMA COMBINED
                  CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL INFORMATION

     In April 2001, E-Stamp signed a definitive merger agreement with Learn2.
The following unaudited pro forma combined condensed consolidated financial
statements present the effects of the proposed merger between E-Stamp and Learn2
under the purchase method of accounting.

     The accompanying unaudited pro forma combined condensed consolidated
balance sheet assumes that the merger took place as of March 31, 2001. The
unaudited pro forma combined condensed consolidated balance sheet combines the
unaudited condensed balance sheet of E-Stamp as of March 31, 2001 and the
unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheet of Learn2 as of March 31, 2001.

     The accompanying unaudited pro forma combined condensed consolidated
statement of operations for the three months ended March 31, 2001 present the
unaudited statement of operations of E-Stamp for the three months ended March
31, 2001 combined with Learn2's unaudited condensed statement of operations for
the three months ended March 31, 2000. The accompanying pro forma combined
condensed consolidated statement of operations for the year ended December 31,
2000 present E-Stamp's condensed statement of operations for the year ended
December 31, 2000 combined with Learn2's audited consolidated statement of
operations for the year ended December 31, 2000. The unaudited pro forma
combined condensed consolidated statements of operations give effect to the
merger as if it occurred as of January 1, 2001 and 2000, respectively.

     The unaudited pro forma combined condensed consolidated financial
statements have been prepared in accordance with the rules and regulations of
the SEC, are provided for illustrative purposes only and are not necessarily
indicative of the operating results or financial position that actually would
have occurred if the merger had been consummated as of the date indicated, nor
are they necessarily indicative of future operating results or financial
position. The combined company will focus on the growing e-learning market. The
pro forma adjustments are based on the information available at the date of this
joint proxy statement-prospectus and are subject to change based upon completion
of the transaction and final purchase price allocation, including completion of
third party appraisals.

     These unaudited pro forma combined condensed consolidated financial
statements should be read in conjunction with the historical supplemental
financial statements and notes thereto of E-Stamp and the historical
consolidated financial statements and notes thereto of Learn2 including
"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations" and "Risk Factors" included elsewhere in this joint proxy
statement-prospectus.

                        NOTES TO THE UNAUDITED PRO FORMA
                    COMBINED CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
                                 (IN THOUSANDS)

 1. BASIS OF PRO FORMA PRESENTATION

     On April 19, 2001, E-Stamp and Learn2 entered into a merger agreement
whereby each outstanding share of Learn2 common stock will be converted into
approximately 0.478 of a share of E-Stamp common stock. Each outstanding option
and warrant to purchase shares of Learn2 common stock will be assumed using the
0.478 ratio. Completion of the merger is conditioned upon the affirmative vote
of both companies' stockholders, among other conditions. E-Stamp expects to
issue approximately 38 million shares of common stock in the merger. The actual
number of shares of E-Stamp common stock to be issued will be determined on the
effective date of the merger based on the number of shares of Learn2 and E-Stamp
common stock actually outstanding on such date. Actual shares outstanding also
includes the number of outstanding stock options of E-Stamp and Learn2 that will
be vested as of the closing of the merger and have an exercise price that is
less than or equal to the average closing price of E-Stamp or Learn2 common
stock, respectively, for the five consecutive trading days immediately preceding
the E-Stamp or Learn2 special meeting, respectively. E-Stamp is expected to
account for the merger under the purchase method of accounting.

     The accompanying unaudited pro forma combined condensed consolidated
balance sheet at March 31, 2001 combines E-Stamp's balance sheet and Learn2's
consolidated balance sheet at March 31, 2001 as if the merger had been
consummated on that date. The accompanying unaudited pro forma combined
condensed consolidated statement of operations combines for the three months
ended March 31, 2001 E-Stamp's unaudited condensed statement of operations for
the three months ended March 31, 2001 and Learn2's unaudited condensed statement
of operations for the three months ended March 31, 2001. The accompanying
unaudited pro forma combined condensed consolidated statement of operations for
the year ended December 31, 2000 combines E-Stamp's audited supplemental
statement of operations for the year ended December 31, 2000 and Learn2's
audited consolidated statement of operations for the year ended December 31,
2000. The unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated statements of operations
give effect to the proposed merger of E-Stamp and Learn2 as if the transaction
had been consummated on January 1, 2001 and 2000, respectively.

 2. PRELIMINARY PURCHASE PRICE

     The unaudited pro forma combined condensed consolidated financial
statements reflect an estimated purchase price of approximately $18.6 million,
measured using the closing market price of E-Stamp's common stock on the date
the merger was signed, plus the assumed liabilities, and other costs directly

              COMBINED CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)

     The final purchase price allocation, determined upon the closing of the
merger, will be dependent on the actual number of shares of common stock
exchanged, the actual number of options and warrants assumed, actual liabilities
assumed, and actual acquisition related costs. For purposes of presenting the
pro forma combined condensed consolidated financial statements the allocation is
based upon Learn2's March 31, 2001 consolidated balance sheet which reflects an
estimated valuation of certain non-current assets. They are as follows (in
thousands):

     The following table sets forth the fair value of assets acquired:

Net current assets.........................................  $ 8,438

     The fair value of the net assets acquired of $33,292, exceeded the purchase
price of $18,649, resulting in negative goodwill of $(14,643). As a result, the
negative goodwill will be allocated to reduce proportionately the values
assigned to the $24,854 of non-current assets acquired. The preliminary
allocation is as follows (in thousands):

 3. PRO FORMA ADJUSTMENTS

Balance Sheet

     The accompanying unaudited pro form combined condensed consolidated balance
sheet as of March 31, 2001 combines the balance sheets of E-Stamp and Learn2 as
if the merger was completed on that date and reflects the following pro forma
adjustments:

          (a) As a result of the allocation of negative goodwill to Learn2's
     fixed assets, the net book carrying value at March 31, 2001 of $4.6 million
     was reduced by $2.7 million to $1.9 million.

          (b) As a result of the allocation of negative goodwill to Learn2's
     capitalized software, the net book carrying value at March 31, 2001 of
     $14.9 million was reduced by $8.7 million to the fair value of $6.2
     million.

          (c) As a result of the allocation of negative goodwill to Learn2's
     intangible assets, the net book carrying value at March 31, 2001 of $4.8
     million was reduced by $2.9 million to the fair value of $1.9 million.

          (d) As a result of the allocation of negative goodwill to Learn2's
     other assets, the carrying value at March 31, 2001 of $531,000 was reduced
     by $315,000 to the fair value of $216,000.

                        NOTES TO THE UNAUDITED PRO FORMA

              COMBINED CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)

          (e) To eliminate Learn2 historical goodwill.

          (f) To record estimated direct merger costs of approximately $5.0
     million to be incurred.

          (g) In connection with the merger, prior to the closing of the merger,
     Learn2's $10 million 6% convertible debenture will be redeemed in exchange
     of E-Stamp's payment of $1.0 million, which will be accounted for as part
     of the purchase price, and the issuance of approximately 26.5 million
     shares of Learn2's common stock based on a conversion price $0.41 per share
     plus accrued interest. The issuance of such shares and the conversion of
     the convertible debenture will be effective only if the merger is
     completed, and the merger will be completely only if the issuance of such
     shares and the conversion of the convertible debenture is approved.
     Therefore, for pro forma purposes, the convertible debenture and related
     accrued interest expense of $9.4 million and $635,000, respectively were
     eliminated.

          (h) To reduce deferred revenue to its fair market value.

          (i) To eliminate the historical equity of Learn2 and record the
     E-Stamp shares issued in the merger. Subject to the closing of the merger,
     stock options issued to three of Learn2's board members will be repriced to
     the amounts already paid and the promissory notes issued by such directors
     to Learn2 in the aggregate principal amount of $1.7 million in connection
     with the exercise of the options, will be cancelled and any liens
     thereunder released.

Statement of Operations

     The accompanying unaudited pro forma combined condensed statement of
operations combines the supplemental historical results of E-Stamp and the
historical results of Learn2 for the three months ended March 31, 2001 and the
year ended December 31, 2000. The unaudited pro forma combined condensed
consolidated statement of operations has been prepared as if the proposed merger
of E-Stamp and Learn2 was completed as of January 1, 2001 and 2000 and reflects
the following proforma adjustments.

     Pro forma adjustments for the three months ended March 31, 2001

          (j) To eliminate amortization of Learn2 historical goodwill totaling
     $196,000.

          (k) As a result of the purchase accounting allocation, the carrying
     values of fixed assets, capitalized software, and intangible assets, for
     pro forma purposes, were decreased to their adjusted fair values, therefore
     the associated depreciation and amortization expense related to those
     assets was reduced by $590,000 for the three months ended March 31, 2001.

          (l) As a result of the elimination of Learn2's convertible debenture,
     for pro forma purposes interest expense was reduced by $150,000 for the
     three months ended March 31, 2001.

          (m) Subject to the closing of the merger, stock options issued to
     three of Learn2's board of directors will be repriced. As a result, the
     promissory notes issued by such directors to Learn2 in the aggregate
     principal amount of $1.7 million will be cancelled. The related charge to
     the statement of operations totals $1.7 million.

          (n) As a result of the elimination of Learn2's convertible debenture,
     for pro forma purposes, the non-cash interest expense related to the
     beneficial conversion of the reset from $6.00 to $0.41 was reduced by
     approximately $9.0 million.

          (o) Reflects issuance by E-Stamp of approximately 38 million shares of
     common stock in connection with the merger. Shares used to calculate
     unaudited pro forma loss per share exclude the anti-dilutive effect of
     E-Stamp's options including options assumed in the merger.

          (p) To eliminate amortization of Learn2 historical goodwill totaling
     $1.3 million.

          (q) As a result of the purchase accounting allocation, the carrying
     values of fixed assets, capitalized software, and intangible assets, for
     pro forma purposes, depreciation and amortization expense related to those
     assets was reduced by $3.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2000.

          (r) As a result of the elimination of Learn2's convertible debenture,
     for pro forma purposes interest expense was reduced by $755,000 for the
     year ended December 31, 2000.

          (s) To eliminate the write-off due to the impairment of Learn2
     goodwill and intangibles of $17.9 million.

          (t) Subject to the closing of the merger, stock options issued to
     three of Learn2's board of directors will be repriced to the amounts
     already paid and the promissory notes issued by such directors to Learn2 in
     the aggregate principal amount of $1.7 million in connection with the
     exercise of the options will be cancelled. The related charge to the
     statement of operations totals $1.7 million.

          (u) Reflects issuance by E-Stamp of approximately 38 million shares of
     common stock in connection with the merger. Shares used to calculate
     unaudited pro forma loss per share exclude the anti-dilutive effect of
     E-Stamp's options including options assumed in the merger.

     The current plan for the combined company is to either terminate or
sublease within the terms of the agreement, its lease on its Mountain View, CA
facility. No adjustments have been made to the pro forma financial statements as
it relates to the resolution of this lease. E-Stamp historical supplemental
financial statements reflect rent expense of approximately $4.0 million related
to this lease. As a result of the merger, the combined company plans to take an
additional restructuring charge, excluding the write-off of board of directors
loans as discussed above, of approximately $1.0 to $2.0 million.

                  LEARN2 MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
                OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

     The following discussion of the financial condition and results of
operations of Learn2 should be read in conjunction with the Learn2's
consolidated financial statements and the related notes to those financial
statements included elsewhere in this joint proxy statement-prospectus. This
document contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and
uncertainties. Actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in
these forward-looking statements as a result of certain factors, including but
not limited to, those set forth under "Risk Factors" beginning on page 17 and
elsewhere in this joint proxy statement-prospectus.

OVERVIEW

     Learn2's offerings include engaging online and physical learning and
training products and complementary services, commonly referred to as e-learning
services. Learn2 markets these services to corporate, government and individual
clients and customers. Learn2 believes its mix of products and services provides
it with a competitive advantage toward becoming the e-learning service provider
of choice to its customers.

     Learn2's products provide an engaging learning experience to corporate and
individual customers through interactive multimedia and animated tutorials and
courseware. Learn2's corporate and government customers have access to these
high quality tutorials and additional features such as reporting and
administration through www.Learn2University.com. Additionally, through
www.Learn2.com, visitors can access Learn2's content that includes tips and
step-by-step instructions on a broad spectrum of skills, activities and tasks,
as well as Learn2's multimedia tutorials. Learn2's e-learning products are also
available on CD-ROM and video and can be purchased from Learn2's Website and
major retailers nationwide.

     Through Learn2's subsidiary, eTracks.com, Inc., eTracks provides permission
e-mail marketing and tracking services to customers that have "opt-in" e-mail
customer lists. eTracks' services include e-mail creation, delivery, tracking
and response analysis for a high volume of client e-mail accounts in a short
period of time. eTracks also has developed a proprietary member database of over
500,000 Internet users who have "opted-in" to receive promotional e-mails.
eTracks's clients can supplement their internally developed customer lists with
our member database. In addition, during 2000 and prior, through periodic
e-mails eTracks marketed various electronics and other products to its members.
The demand for permission e-mail marketing and tracking services has increased
over the past few years. As reported by eMarketer in the June 2001 edition of
The e-mail Marketing Report, total e-mail marketing spending in the US in 2000
was just over $1 billion, including $496 million on e-mail ads, up from $422
million in 1999. According to eMarketer, by year-end 2003, US businesses and
other organizations will spend almost $4.6 billion, including $2.2 billion on
e-mail advertising expenditures. As a result, Learn2 expects that the demand
will continue to grow for the foreseeable future. Learn2 believes that eTracks'
technology enables more robust and useful tracking capabilities than its
competitors'.

     Learn2's goal is to become the world's leading provider of engaging
e-learning products and services. To achieve this goal, Learn2 expects to focus
on its four primary objectives: creating a trusted brand, developing and owning
creative and engaging content, enhancing its patented state-of-the-art
technologies and offering services to meet the needs of its clients. In 1999,
Learn2 changed its company name from 7th Level, Inc. to Learn2.com, Inc. Learn2
made the change to create a single recognized brand that more closely aligned
Learn2's corporate identity with its product and service offerings.

HISTORY

     Learn2 was founded in 1993 with the goal of becoming a leading developer
and publisher of interactive entertainment and educational content as well as a
creator of state-of-the-art tools and technologies. In 1998, Learn2's research
and development activities were focused primarily on developing and enhancing
its agent technology. In early 1999, Learn2 recognized that appropriate
applications of this

technology were in the delivery of training and learning and therefore Learn2
abandoned its interactive entertainment business and focused its efforts on
e-learning.

     In 1999, to strengthen its position in the e-learning marketplace, Learn2
acquired three companies that enhanced its brand, content, technologies and
services capabilities: Street Technologies, Inc., a privately held company that
developed and marketed technology-based training products and services delivered
over intranets and the Internet utilizing a patented streaming technology and
provided custom service capabilities; Panmedia Corporation, a privately held
company that produced www.Learn2.com, a popular Website that offered
step-by-step instructions on skills, activities and tasks; and ViaGrafix
Corporation, a publicly traded company which developed, produced and marketed
technology-based training tutorials delivered on CD-ROMs and video tapes as well
as computer aided design or CAD software. The CAD product line was sold in March
2000. Through eTracks, ViaGrafix also provided permission e-mail broadcast
services and conducted e-commerce. These acquisitions provided Learn2 with the
Learn2 brand, and a stronger mix of content, technologies and service offerings.

     As set forth in Note 4 to Learn2's consolidated financial statements,
Learn2 reported results of operations for all periods prior to August 23, 1999
do not reflect the results of ViaGrafix and prior to February 16, 1999 do not
reflect the results of Street Technologies, Inc. Consequently, the results prior
to these dates and Learn2's consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 1998 are
not reflective of its operations and financial position as presently
constituted.

     Effective January 1, 2000, Learn2 has adopted Staff Accounting Bulletin No.
101 "Revenue Recognition In Financial Statements." SAB No. 101 expresses the
views of the Securities and Exchange Commission in applying accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States to certain revenue
recognition issues.

     Learn2's adoption of SAB No. 101 resulted in a change in method of
accounting for cooperative advertising expenses. In accordance with previously
existing accounting principles, Learn2 recorded cooperative advertising expenses
as a sales and marketing expense. During 2000, as a result of new
interpretations of generally accepted accounting principles by the SEC through
the issuance of SAB No. 101, Learn2 was required to change the accounting policy
for cooperative advertising, to record these expenses as a reduction of gross
revenues.

     The effect of the adoption of SAB No. 101 was to decrease both revenues and
sales and marketing expenses by $3.5 million. SAB No. 101 has been adopted as a
change in accounting principle, effective January 1, 2000. The adoption of SAB
No. 101 resulted in no change to current or previously reported earnings, as
this was a reclassification between revenue and sales and marketing expenses.
Learn2 has restated its results for the first three quarters of the year ended
December 31, 2000 and for the year ended December 31, 1999, as reflected in
Quarterly Financial Data on page 103. There was no restatement required for the
year ended December 31, 1998. The adjustment for the year ended December 31,
1999 was a decrease to both net revenues and sales and marketing expenses by
$1.3 million.

SOURCES OF REVENUE AND REVENUE RECOGNITION POLICY

     Learn2 generates revenue primarily from the sales and licensing of computer
software training products and technologies, product development agreements, and
broadcast messaging services.

     Revenue from software license agreements is recognized in accordance with
the provisions of American Institute of Certified Public Accountants Statement
of Position No. 97-2, "Software Revenue Recognition." Software product sales
under such license agreements are recognized as revenue upon shipment of the
products to customers, provided that there are no significant vendor obligations
and collection of the related receivable is probable. In circumstances whereby
Learn2 has established vendor specific objective evidence, Learn2 accounts for
insignificant vendor obligations and post-contract support over the service
period.

     Revenue from on-line sales is recognized when persuasive evidence of an
arrangement exists, delivery has occurred, the sales price is fixed or
determinable and collectibility is probable. Learn2 defers a portion,

generally 10% of the selling price of on-line products for hosting and
recognizes that hosting ratably over the contractual period. Learn2 recognizes
the two components, the software, (or training course) and the service (or
hosting) based on their relative fair values.

     Revenue from physical product sales is recognized when persuasive evidence
of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred, the sales price is fixed or
determinable and collectibility is probable. Generally, these criteria are met
at the time product is shipped. A reserve is made at the time the related
revenue is recognized for estimated product returns based on history,
cooperative advertising, or other promotions which may occur under programs
Learn2 has with its customers.

     Revenues from broadcast messaging transactions are recognized at the time
the broadcast is sent, as Learn2 has no further significant obligations.

     Many of Learn2's costs are fixed and are based on anticipated revenue
levels. Learn2 may be unable to adjust spending quickly enough to offset any
unexpected revenue shortfall. If Learn2 has a shortfall in revenues in relation
to expenses, or if expenses continue to exceed revenues, then Learn2's results
of operations and financial condition would be affected materially and
adversely. Learn2 expects to incur losses on a quarterly and annual basis for
the foreseeable future, however Learn2 believes it has adequate resources to
realize Learn2's business plan.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2001 AND 2000

     Revenues and gross profits for the quarter ended March 31, 2001 increased
over the quarter ended March 31, 2000 as a result of volume increases in
corporate training revenue and revenue associated with Learn2's custom business.
Operating expenses decreased to $6.0 million from $9.6 million in the first
quarter of 2000. The decrease in expenses is attributable primarily to cost
reduction efforts implemented in May of 2000 and January of 2001. Net loss
increased to $10.9 from $5.9 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2000. The
first quarter net loss included the additional interest expense of $9.0 million
recorded as a result of the beneficial conversion price reset from $6.00 to
$0.41 on the $10.0 million convertible debenture. Excluding the effect of the
additional interest expense, the loss for the quarter was $1.9 million.

     The following table sets forth industry segment information for the three
months ended March 31, 2001 and 2000:

LEARNING SERVICES

     Learning Services revenues consist primarily of learning products and
services sold or distributed through the Internet and of physical products sold
through traditional retail channels and on-line. Cost of revenues consists of
the expenses associated with the production and shipment of Learn2's physical
products. In addition, it includes related costs to develop custom courses for
specific customers.

     Net revenues for Learning Services increased approximately 17.2% to $4.9
million for the quarter ended March 31, 2001 from $4.2 million for the quarter
ended March 31, 2000. For the quarter ended March 31, 2001, net revenues were
composed of corporate learning products, technologies and services sold,
licensed or distributed through the Internet of approximately $3.6 million or
73.5% of revenues, consumer learning products sold through traditional retail
channels and on-line of $1.2 million or 24.5% of revenues, and other revenue of
$80,000 or 2.0% of revenues.

     For the quarter ended March 31, 2000, these revenues were composed of
corporate learning products, technologies and services sold, licensed or
distributed through the Internet of approximately $1.9 million or 45.2% of
revenues, consumer learning products sold through traditional retail channels
and on-line of $1.6 million or 38.1%, software sales related to our CAD product
line, which was sold in March 2000, of $400,000 or 9.6% of revenues and other
revenue of $300,000 or 7.1% of revenues.

     Learning Services gross profit was approximately 75.2% of net revenues for
the quarter ended March 31, 2001 compared to 74.0% of net revenues for the
quarter ended March 31, 2000. The change in gross profit was the result of the
differences in the composition of revenues as noted above.

BROADCAST MESSAGING SERVICES

     Broadcast Messaging Services consists primarily of permission e-mail
marketing and tracking services and e-commerce. Cost of revenues consists of the
expenses associated with the delivery of permission e-mail and tracking
services, including Internet access and personnel related costs incurred to
operate our marketing and tracking services and cost of merchandise sold through
our e-commerce operations.

     Net revenues for the Broadcast Messaging Services decreased approximately
49.3% to $645,000 for the quarter ended March 31, 2001, compared to $1.3 million
for the quarter ended March 31, 2000. Broadcast Messaging Services gross profit
was 93.6% of net revenues for the quarter ended March 31, 2001 compared to 46.2%
of net revenues for the quarter ended March 31, 2000. The increase in gross
profit was result of a change in the composition of revenues. 2001 revenue
consisted primarily of broadcast messaging revenue which has higher gross
margins compared to 2000 revenue which also consisted of product revenues which
have lower gross margins.

OPERATING EXPENSES

Research And Product Development Expenses

     Research and product development expenses were approximately $697,000 for
the quarter ended March 31, 2001 compared to $2.1 million for the quarter ended
March 31, 2000. Research and product development expenses relate to the
development and enhancement of Learn2's technologies, content, Website and
product design. The decrease in expenses is attributable primarily to cost
reduction efforts implemented in May 2000 and January 2001. Learn2 believes that
investment in research and development is required to remain competitive.
Therefore, Learn2 anticipates continued spending for research and development in
future periods.

Sales And Marketing Expenses

     Sales and marketing expenses were approximately $2.1 million for the
quarter ended March 31, 2001, compared to $3.5 million for the quarter ended
March 31, 2000. Sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of salaries,
commissions, advertising, trade show expenses and costs of marketing materials.
The decrease in expenses is attributable primarily to cost reductions efforts
implemented in May 2000 and January 2001. Sales and marketing expenses may
increase in future periods in our continued effort to achieve growth in revenue
and introduce new products.

General And Administrative Expenses

quarter ended March 31, 2001, compared to $2.5 million for the quarter ended
March 31, 2000. General and administrative expenses consist primarily of
personnel related costs, occupancy costs and professional service fees. The
decrease in expenses is attributable primarily to cost reduction efforts
implemented in May of 2000 and January of 2001.

Beneficial Conversion Feature

     In connection with the reset of the conversion price on the $10.0 million
convertible debenture, on March 10, 2001, Learn2 recorded additional interest
expense of $9.0 million as a result of the reduction of the original conversion
price from $6.00 to $0.41.

Net Loss

     The net loss was approximately $10.9 million for the quarter ended March
31, 2001, compared to $5.8 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2000 and was
attributable to the factors discussed above. Excluding the effect of the
additional interest expense of $9.0 million recorded as a result of the reset on
the $10.0 million convertible debenture, the loss for the quarter was $1.9
million or $0.04 per share.

2000 COMPARED TO 1999

     Revenues and gross profits for 2000 increased over 1999 primarily as the
result of the inclusion of the full year of revenues from Learn2's acquisition
of ViaGrafix in 1999. Revenues and gross profits also increased as a result of
volume increases in corporate training revenue and revenue associated with
Learn2's custom business. Operating expenses increased to $53.5 million from
$50.1 million in 1999, and included $17.9 million in goodwill and other
intangible asset impairments, $6.1 million in fixed and intangible asset
amortization, and $600,000 in non-recurring charges in 2000. Operating expenses

a non-recurring charge of approximately $641,000 primarily for severance. During
the second quarter of 1999, Learn2 completed its merger with Panmedia
Corporation. Learn2 recorded a non-recurring charge of approximately $277,000
for transaction costs associated with the merger.

Acquired In-process Technology

     In 1999, in connection with Learn2's acquisitions of Street Technologies,
Inc., and ViaGrafix, Learn2 allocated approximately $9.7 million and $15.1
million of their respective purchase prices to acquired in-process technology.
Accordingly these costs were expensed as of the acquisition date. Amounts
allocated to acquired in-process technology relate to projects that had not yet
reached technological feasibility and that, until completion of development, had
no alternative future use. The technologies acquired required substantial
additional development.

Impairment of Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets

     As a result of the operating losses incurred by ViaGrafix, Learn2 reviewed
the recoverability of the goodwill and other intangible assets associated with
its acquisition of ViaGrafix in accordance with its accounting policy for
long-lived assets. Based on an analysis of projected undiscounted cash flows,
Learn2 determined that the carrying value of such goodwill and other intangible
assets was impaired. Accordingly, Learn2 engaged an outside appraiser to assist
with the analysis and based upon the resulting valuation, Learn2 recognized
approximately $17.9 million in impairment charges. The impairment charge was
comprised of approximately $8.9 million of goodwill, $8.5 million of intangible
assets, and $500,000 of capitalized software. The impairment charges are equal
to the difference between the carrying amount of these assets and the estimated
fair value at December 31, 2000.

million convertible debenture issued in 2000. Interest expense in 1999 was
related primarily to the 7% Convertible Notes Payable that were due and payable
on February 11, 1999. To induce the holders to convert the notes into common
stock, on February 10, 1999, Learn2 offered the holders the right to convert at
a price equal to 85% of the then current market value of the stock. During
February 1999, Learn2 issued 186,982 shares of common stock in exchange for
$458,000 of current notes payable. In connection with the conversion, Learn2
recognized interest expense of approximately $115,000 as a result of the premium
paid to induce the conversion of the notes.

of a $1.5 million charge relating to the disposal of assets. This was partially
offset by the reversal of accrued royalty expense of $238,000 in excess of an
accrued royalty that was recorded in a prior period. As a result of the timing
of the transaction, the excess was recorded to other income.

Net Loss

     The net loss was $41.0 million for 1999 compared to $10.6 million for 1998
and was attributable to the factors discussed above.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

     Since inception, Learn2 has financed its operations primarily through
private placements of equity and debt securities and public offerings of
Learn2's common stock. On April 19, 2001, Learn2 reached an agreement to merge
with E-Stamp. Assuming satisfaction of certain conditions, including receipt of
the requisite stockholder approval, the merger is expected to be consummated in
the third quarter of 2001. Completion of the merger is expected to enhance
Learn2's ability to finance its growth as cash flow and capital markets access
of the combined companies will be greater than prior to the merger.

     Net cash used in operating activities was approximately $923,000 for the
first quarter of 2001. Cash used in operating activities resulted primarily from
our net loss, an overall decrease in operating assets and liabilities, offset by
increases in non-cash charges.

     Net cash used in investing activities was approximately $410,000 for the
first quarter of 2001. Cash used in investing activities consisted primarily of
capitalized content development costs and capital expenditures partially offset
by proceeds from the sales of assets.

     As of March 31, 2001, Learn2 had $3.4 million in cash and cash equivalents.
As of March 31, 2001, Learn2's commitments consisted primarily of obligations
under operating leases. Learn2 has no material commitments for capital
expenditures.

     On March 10, 2000, Learn2 entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement and
pursuant thereto it issued a $10 million 6% convertible debenture due March 10,
2003. The debenture is convertible at any time at the option of the holder at a
conversion price of $0.41 per share, as reset on March 10, 2001. In connection
with the reset on March 10, 2001, Learn2 recorded interest expense of $9 million
as a result of the reduction of the original conversion price from $6.00 to
$0.41. The debenture is subject to anti-dilution provisions. The conversion
price of the debenture also may be reset to the market value of Learn2's common
stock on the second anniversary of the convertible debenture if the price of
Learn2's common stock declines below $0.41 on the second anniversary. In
addition, the holder was granted a five-year warrant to purchase 337,268 shares
of Learn2 common stock exercisable at $7.41 per share. The value of this warrant
has been recorded as a debt discount and is being amortized over the life of the
related debt.

     On April 19, 2001, the holder executed a waiver agreeing not to exercise
any of its rights under the debenture to declare an event of default or convert
the debenture with certain exceptions as provided in the waiver; with respect to
Learn2's failure to register shares of common stock, issuable as a result of the
conversion price reset on March 10, 2001, provided that Learn2 files a
registration statement by September 30, 2001 covering the shares of Learn2
common stock issuable under the debenture following the reset of the conversion
price of the debenture.

     On April 19, 2001, Learn2, E-Stamp and the holder of debenture entered into
a redemption and termination agreement. Pursuant to the redemption and
termination agreement, the holder of the debenture has agreed that, immediately
prior to the completion of the merger between Learn2 and E-Stamp, the debenture
will be redeemed in exchange of E-Stamp's payment of $1.0 million, which will be
accounted for as part of the purchase price, and the issuance of approximately
26.5 million shares of Learn2's common stock based on a conversion price of
$0.41 per share plus accrued interest.

     As of March 31, 2001, one customer represented approximately 14.8% of
accounts receivable. This customer represents a disproportionate percentage of
March 31, 2001 accounts receivable as it relates to a software license sale in
2000.

     To date, we have used cash and operate at a loss. We believe we will have
sufficient resources for our operating requirements and sufficient resources to
realize our current business plan. However, our ability to achieve positive cash
flow depends upon a variety of factors, including the timely introduction and
market success of our products, the costs of developing, producing and marketing
these products, adoption of the Internet as a medium of commerce and delivery of
services, general economic conditions and various other factors, some of which
may be beyond our control. Many of our costs are fixed and are based on
anticipated revenue levels. We may be unable to adjust spending quickly enough
to offset any unexpected revenue shortfall. If we have a shortfall in revenues
in relation to expenses, or if expenses continue to exceed revenues, then our
results of operations and financial condition would be affected adversely and we
may need to raise additional funds. In the event that the proposed merger with
E-Stamp is not consummated, and we need to raise additional funds we cannot be
certain that we will be successful nor can we predict the terms under which such
funds would be available. If additional funds are not available we may not be
able to meet our on-going expenses unless we change our business plan, sell
non-strategic assets, curtail expenditures, and/or employ other strategies as

(1) In connection with Learn2's adoption of SAB No. 101 effective January 1,
    2000 Learn2 began recording cooperative advertising expenses as a reduction
    of gross revenues. This change had no effect on previously reported results
    of operations in 1999. Learn2 has restated its results for the first three
    quarters of the year ended December 31, 2000. Revenues previously reported
    for the quarters ended March 31, June 30 and September 30 were $6,446,
    $7,084, and $7,053, respectively.

(2)In connection with Learn2's adoption of SAB No. 101, Learn2 has restated its
   results for 1999. Revenues previously reported for the quarter ended December
   31, 1999 was $7,348.

(3) Includes a charge of approximately $17.9 million for the impairment of
    goodwill and other intangible assets in the fourth quarter of 2000.

     The quarterly earnings per share data above are computed independently for
each of the quarters presented. As such, the sum of the quarterly per common
share information may not equal the full year amounts due to rounding
differences resulting from changes in the weighted-average number of common
shares outstanding.

                E-STAMP MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF

                 FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

     The following discussion of the financial condition and results of
operations of E-Stamp should be read in conjunction with E-Stamp's supplemental
financial statements and the related notes to those financial statements
included elsewhere in this joint proxy statement-prospectus. This document
contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Actual
results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking
statements as a result of certain factors, including but not limited to, those
set forth under "Risk Factor" beginning on page 17 and elsewhere in this joint
proxy statement-prospectus.

OVERVIEW

     E-Stamp originally provided an Internet postage service that enabled users
to purchase, download and print Internet postage directly from their personal
computers without the need to maintain a persistent Internet connection. In May
2000, E-Stamp acquired two companies, Infinity Logistics Corporation and
Automated Logistics Corp. These companies offered transportation management and
warehouse management products and services that allowed enterprise customers to
review carrier rates and shipping options, select a carrier, print shipping
labels, track shipments and create shipping reports.

     During 2000, E-Stamp undertook two corporate restructurings. In July 2000,
E-Stamp restructured its organization to focus on the development, marketing and
sales of the transportation management products and services and reduce its
emphasis on the Internet postage business. In November 2000, E-Stamp
restructured its organization to phase out the Internet postage business.
E-Stamp incurred charges of approximately $20.3 million related to these
restructurings.

     On April 19, 2001, E-Stamp entered into a merger agreement with Learn2.com,
Inc., a provider of e-learning solutions. Pursuant to the merger agreement,
Learn2 will merge with E-Stamp, with E-Stamp remaining as the surviving
corporation. The merger is subject to certain conditions set forth in the merger
agreement, including a minimum net cash requirement, as defined in the merger
agreement, at the closing date and the approval of the stockholders of E-Stamp
and Learn2. E-Stamp also has discontinued its remaining transportation
management business. Therefore, the financial statements and notes included
herein reflect E-Stamp's businesses as discontinued operations in accordance
with Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 30. The results of discontinued
operations do not include any interest income, interest expense or allocation of
corporate expenses. In the event that the merger is completed, E-Stamp intends
to conduct the e-learning solutions business of Learn2.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2001 AND 2000

     General corporate expenses. General corporate expenses consist of general
and administrative overhead expenses, including expenses associated with the
general responsibilities of a public company, and exclude those costs associated
with the transportation management and Internet postage businesses. These
expenses include salaries and related costs for certain administrative
functions, professional services, including legal and accounting services,
insurance and an allocation of facilities costs. The decrease in these expenses
in the three months ended March 31, 2001 compared to the three months ended
March 31, 2000 is primarily due to lower amortization of deferred stock
compensation, which is recorded using the graded vesting method, partially
offset by higher professional services costs, including legal and accounting
services.

     Interest income, net. Interest income, net, consists primarily of earnings
on our cash and cash equivalents, net of interest expense. Interest income, net,
was $0.5 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2001, compared to $1.4 million
for the quarter ended March 31, 2000. The decrease in interest income, net, was
due to decreased interest earned as a result of decreased cash balances
resulting from the continued use of cash to fund operations.

'Loss from discontinued operations. For the three months ended March 31, 2001,
loss from discontinued operations reflects the operating expenses related to the
transportation management business net of revenues from that business of $0.3
million. For the three months ended March 31, 2000, loss from discontinued
operations reflects the operating expenses related to the Internet postage
business net of revenues from that business of $1.5 million. Operating expenses
for the three months ended March 31, 2001 were significantly reduced from
operating expenses for the three months ended March 31, 2000 primarily due to
reduced headcount resulting from restructuring efforts in 2000. In addition,
E-Stamp significantly reduced its advertising and promotional activities in the
first quarter of 2001 compared to the first quarter of 2000. Amortization of
deferred stock compensation, which is recorded using the graded vesting method,
decreased by $2.2 million in the three months ended March 31, 2001 from the
three months ended March 31, 2000.

     These decreases in operating expenses were partially offset by charges
totaling $4.7 million related to the amortization and write off of goodwill and
other intangible assets related to the transportation management solutions
business. During the three months ended March 31, 2001, E-Stamp identified
possible indicators of impairment of these assets and determined that these
assets had a fair value of zero. In addition, E-Stamp wrote off property and
equipment held for disposal as a result of reduced employee headcount totaling
$1.4 million.

     E-Stamp expects that the cost of the discontinuance of its business will be
less than the proceeds to be realized from the discontinuance, primarily as a
result of the sale of its Internet postage intellectual property in April 2001
to Stamps.com for $7.5 million.

YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2000, 1999 AND 1998

     General corporate expenses. General corporate expenses totaled $8.2 million
in 2000, $9.2 million in 1999 and $1.6 million in 1998. The decrease in 2000
from 1999 was primarily due to lower salary cost as a result of lower bonuses
paid and lower amortization of deferred stock compensation partially offset by
higher facilities costs. The increase in 1999 from 1998 was due to higher salary
levels as a result of increased staffing levels in administrative functions and
higher amortization of deferred stock compensation.

     Interest income, net. Interest income, net, was $3.8 million in 2000,
compared to $1.9 million in 1999 and $0.4 million in 1998. The increase in
interest income, net, was due to increased interest earned as a result of higher
average cash balances resulting from E-Stamp's initial public offering in
October 1999 and private placements of preferred stock in August 1999 and July
1998.

     Loss from discontinued operations. For the year ended December 31, 2000,
loss from discontinued operations reflects the operating expenses related to the
transportation management business and the Internet postage business, net of
revenues from those businesses of $5.3 million. Operating expenses in 2000 were
significantly higher than operating expenses in 1999, primarily due to increased
headcount related exp
