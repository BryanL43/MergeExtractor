    additional 435,848 shares being registered in connection with this
    registration statement no. 333-54856.

(3) The proposed maximum aggregate offering price is the sum of the proposed
    maximum aggregate offering price of $54,750,359 set forth previously in

                     QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS ABOUT THE MERGER

 1.Q:  Why are the two companies proposing to merge? (see page 46)

  A: Chordiant and Prime Response are proposing to merge because we believe
     the resulting combination will create a stronger, more competitive
     company capable of achieving greater financial strength, earning power,
     growth potential, operational efficiencies and technological
     development, than either company would have been able to achieve on its
     own.

 2.Q:  As a Prime Response stockholder, what will I receive in the merger? (see
       page 68)

  A: As a result of the merger, Prime Response stockholders will receive 0.60
     of a share of Chordiant common stock for each share of Prime Response
     common stock that they own, except that Prime Response stockholders will
     receive a cash payment in lieu of any fractional share of Chordiant
     common stock they would otherwise be entitled to receive. For example,
     if you own 212 shares of Prime Response common stock, you will receive
     in exchange for your Prime Response shares, 127 shares of Chordiant
     common stock and a cash payment equal to the value of 0.20 of a share of
     Chordiant common stock, based on the closing price of Chordiant common
     stock on the Nasdaq National Market on the date the merger is completed.
     The 0.60 exchange ratio is fixed and will not be adjusted based upon
     changes in the value of Prime Response or Chordiant common stock. As a
     result, the value of the Chordiant shares you will receive in the merger
     will not be known before the completion of the merger and will go up or
     down as the market price of Chordiant common stock goes up or down. You
     are encouraged to obtain current market quotations of Prime Response and
     Chordiant common stock.

 3.Q:  What do I need to do now? (see pages 35 and 38)

  A: You should read this joint proxy statement/prospectus carefully,
     including its annexes, and consider how the merger will affect you. Then
     you should mail your signed proxy card in the enclosed return envelope
     as soon as possible, so that your shares can be voted at the special
     meeting of Chordiant stockholders or the special meeting of Prime
     Response stockholders.

 4.Q:  What happens if I do not return a proxy card or vote in person? (see
       pages 36 and 39)

  A: The failure to return your proxy card or vote in person could be a
     factor in establishing quorums for the special meetings of Chordiant and
     Prime Response stockholders. The special meetings of stockholders for
     both companies can only take place if a quorum is established. Also,
     abstentions and broker non-votes will have the same effect as votes
     "AGAINST" the issuance of shares of Chordiant common stock in the merger
     or "AGAINST" the adoption of the merger agreement, as the case may be.
     In addition, the failure of a Chordiant stockholder to return a proxy or
     to vote in person will have the effect of a vote "AGAINST" the proposal
     to issue shares of Chordiant common stock in the merger. If you are a
     Prime Response stockholder, the failure to return your proxy card or
     vote in person will have the same effect as voting "AGAINST" the
     adoption of the merger agreement.

 5.Q:  What happens if I return a signed and dated proxy card but do not
       indicate how to vote my proxy? (see pages 35 and 38)

  A: If you are a Chordiant stockholder and do not include instructions on
     how to vote your properly signed and dated proxy card, your shares will
     be voted "FOR" the issuance of shares of Chordiant common stock in the
     merger. If you are a Prime Response stockholder and do not include
     instructions on how to vote your properly signed and dated proxy card,
     your shares will be voted "FOR" the adoption of the merger agreement.

 6.Q:  May I vote in person? (see pages 35 and 38)

  A: Yes. You may attend the special meeting of the Chordiant stockholders or
     the special meeting of the Prime Response stockholders, as the case may
     be, and vote your shares in person, rather than signing, dating and
     returning your proxy card.

 7.Q:  May I change my vote after I have mailed my signed and dated proxy card?
       (see pages 35 and 38)

  A: Yes. You may change your vote at any time before your proxy card is
     voted at either the Chordiant special meeting or the Prime Response
     special meeting. You can do this in one of three ways. First, you can
     send a written, dated notice stating that you would like to revoke your
     proxy. Second, you can complete, date and submit a new proxy card.
     Third, you can attend the meeting and vote in person. Your attendance
     alone will not revoke your proxy. If you have instructed a broker to
     vote your shares, you must follow directions provided by your broker to
     change your instructions.

 8.Q:  If my shares are held in "street name" by my broker, will my broker vote
       my shares for me? (see pages 35 and 38)

  A: Your broker will not be able to vote your shares without instructions
     from you. You should instruct your broker to vote your shares, following
     the procedure provided by your broker.

 9.Q:  What does the Chordiant board of directors recommend? (see page 48)

  A: The Chordiant board of directors has approved the merger agreement and
     the merger and recommends that Chordiant stockholders vote "FOR" the
     issuance of shares of Chordiant common stock in the merger.

10.Q:  What does the Prime Response board of directors recommend? (see page 50)

  A: The Prime Response board of directors has approved the merger agreement
     and the merger and recommends that Prime Response stockholders vote
     "FOR" the adoption of the merger agreement.

11.Q:  Should I send in my Prime Response stock certificates now? (see page 68)

  A: No. If you are a Prime Response stockholder, after the merger is
     completed, you will receive written instructions for exchanging the
     certificates representing your shares of Prime Response common stock for
     certificates representing shares of Chordiant common stock. You will
     also receive a cash payment in lieu of any fractional share of Chordiant
     common stock you would otherwise be entitled to receive.

12.Q:  When is the merger expected to be completed? (see page 75)

  A: The parties are working towards completing the merger as quickly as
     possible. In addition to stockholder approval, each of Chordiant and
     Prime Response must satisfy or waive all of the closing conditions
     contained in the merger agreement. The parties hope to complete the
     merger promptly after the Chordiant and Prime Response special
     stockholder meetings.

13.Q:  Will the merger trigger the recognition of gain or loss for United
       States federal income tax purposes? (see page 64)

  A: The merger has been structured as a reorganization for United States
     federal income tax purposes. Prime Response stockholders will not
     recognize gain or loss for United States federal income tax purposes by
     exchanging their Prime Response shares for any Chordiant shares in the
     merger.

     However, Prime Response stockholders will recognize a gain or loss on
     any cash received in lieu of a fractional share of Chordiant common
     stock. Chordiant and Prime Response will receive legal opinions to this
     effect as a condition of closing the merger. Tax matters are very
     complicated and the tax consequences to Prime Response stockholders will
     depend on each stockholder's own circumstances. Each Prime Response
     stockholder should consult with his, her or its tax advisor for a full
     understanding of the tax consequences of the merger to that stockholder.

14.Q: Am I entitled to dissenters' or appraisal rights? (see pages 36 and 39)

  A: No, Chordiant stockholders and Prime Response stockholders are not
     entitled to dissenters' or appraisal rights in connection with the
     merger.

15.Q: Who can help answer my additional questions? (see page 169)

  A: If you would like additional copies, without charge, of this joint proxy
     statement/prospectus or if you have questions about the merger,
     including the procedures for voting your shares, you should contact:

MERGER STRUCTURE; EXCHANGE RATIO (Page 68)

   If the merger is completed, a subsidiary of Chordiant will merge with and
into Prime Response and Prime Response will become a wholly-owned subsidiary of
Chordiant. Upon completion of the merger, Prime Response stockholders will
become entitled to receive 0.60 of a share of Chordiant common stock in
exchange for each share of Prime Response common stock that they own at the
time of the completion of the merger, except that Prime Response stockholders
will receive cash in lieu of any fractional share of Chordiant common stock
they would otherwise be entitled to receive. We refer in this document to the
0.60 ratio by which shares of Prime Response common stock are to be exchanged
in the merger for shares of Chordiant common stock as the "exchange ratio."

   The exchange ratio is fixed. Regardless of fluctuations in the market prices
of Chordiant's or Prime Response's common stock, the exchange ratio will not
change between now and the date that the merger is completed. Neither Prime
Response nor Chordiant has the right to terminate the merger agreement or
renegotiate the exchange ratio as a result of market price fluctuations. You
are encouraged to obtain current market quotations of Prime Response and
Chordiant common stock.

Chordiant common stock in the merger is intended to be tax-free to Prime
Response stockholders for United States federal income tax purposes. However,
Prime Response stockholders will recognize a gain or loss on any cash received
in lieu of a fractional share of Chordiant common stock. Each Prime Response
stockholder's tax basis in the shares of Chordiant common stock that he, she or
it is to receive in the merger will equal such stockholder's current tax basis
in his, her or its Prime Response common stock, reduced by the basis allocable
to any fractional share interest for which he, she or it receives cash.

   TAX MATTERS CAN BE COMPLICATED, AND THE TAX CONSEQUENCES OF THE MERGER TO
PRIME RESPONSE STOCKHOLDERS WILL DEPEND ON THE FACTS OF THEIR OWN SITUATION.
PRIME RESPONSE STOCKHOLDERS SHOULD CONSULT THEIR OWN TAX ADVISORS TO FULLY
UNDERSTAND THE TAX CONSEQUENCES OF THE MERGER TO THEM.

REASONS FOR THE MERGER

   Chordiant (Page 46). Chordiant's primary reasons for seeking to complete the
merger with Prime Response are the beliefs of the board of directors and
management of Chordiant that the merger could result in a number of benefits to
Chordiant, including the following:

  .  entry into new strategic market segments for Chordiant, with the
     potential for growth through an established market leader;

  .  the ability of the combined company to offer existing and potential
     customers complementary and expanded product lines;

  .  Prime Response's marketing software applications, technologies and
     technical, engineering and sales expertise, which are in high demand and
     in short supply; and

  .  the ability of the two companies to combine their technological
     resources to develop new and improved products and additional
     applications.

   Prime Response (Page 48). Prime Response's board of directors believes that
the merger could be beneficial to Prime Response and its stockholders for a
number of reasons, including the following:

  .  the merger would provide Prime Response stockholders with shares of
     Chordiant common stock in a tax-free exchange for United States federal
     income tax purposes at an implied premium over the market price for
     Prime Response common stock at the time the merger agreement was entered
     into;

  .  the availability following the merger of greater resources to continue
     to establish and support sales of both companies' products;

  .  the ability to make greater resources available for the distribution of
     Prime Response's products and services;

  .  enabling the combined company to offer complementary product lines,
     which presents the opportunity to increase the breadth of products and
     services offered;

  .  the enhanced ability of the combined company to offer product offerings
     with more comprehensive features and functionality, in order to be
     better positioned as the competitive market evolves and competitive
     products are introduced; and

  .  the ability of the combined enterprise to better attract experienced and
     required personnel, particularly in sales and marketing, in light of the
     combined enterprise's greater available resources and geographic
     presence.

RECOMMENDATION TO STOCKHOLDERS

   To Chordiant Stockholders (Page 48). The Chordiant board of directors

common stock in the merger.

OPINIONS OF FINANCIAL ADVISORS

   Opinion of Chordiant's Financial Advisor (Page 50). In deciding to approve

fair to Chordiant from a financial point of view. The full text of the Thomas
Weisel Partners opinion describes the basis of this opinion and is attached as

approve the merger, one of the factors that the Prime Response board of
directors considered was the opinion of its financial advisor, Robertson
Stephens, Inc., dated January 5, 2001, that, as of the date of the opinion and
subject to and based on the assumptions, limitations and qualifications
referred to in the opinion, the exchange ratio pursuant to the merger agreement

of view. The full text of the Robertson Stephens opinion describes the basis

Recent Closing Prices

   The following table sets forth the closing per share sale prices of
Chordiant common stock and Prime Response common stock as reported on the
Nasdaq National Market and the estimated equivalent per share price, as
explained below, of Prime Response common stock on January 8, 2001, the last
full trading day before the public announcement of the proposed merger, and on
February 23, 2001, the latest full trading day before the printing of this
joint proxy statement/prospectus:

                                                            Estimated Equivalent
                                 Chordiant   Prime Response    Prime Response
                                Common Stock  Common Stock    Per Share Price
                                ------------ -------------- --------------------

   January 8, 2001.............    $2.75         $1.69             $1.65
   February 23, 2001...........    $2.88         $1.50             $1.73

   The estimated equivalent per share price of Prime Response common stock
equals the exchange ratio of 0.60 multiplied by the price of a share of
Chordiant common stock on the applicable date. If the merger had occurred on
February 23, 2001, you would have received a fraction of a share of Chordiant
common stock worth $1.73 on such date for each share of Prime Response common
stock you owned. Because the exchange ratio is fixed at 0.60 of a share of
Chordiant common stock for each share of Prime Response common stock and the
market price of Chordiant common stock is subject to fluctuation, the market
value of the shares of Chordiant common stock that holders of Prime Response
common stock will receive in the merger may increase or decrease prior to and
following the merger. We urge you to obtain current market quotations for
Chordiant common stock and Prime Response common stock. No assurance can be
given as to the future prices or markets for Chordiant common stock or Prime
Response common stock.

              SUMMARY UNAUDITED PRO FORMA COMBINED CONDENSED

                           FINANCIAL INFORMATION

   The Summary Unaudited Pro Forma Combined Condensed Financial Information is
derived from the Chordiant Software, Inc. Unaudited Pro Forma Combined
Condensed Financial Information, which give effect to the merger as a purchase
and should be read in conjunction with such Unaudited Pro Forma Combined
Condensed Financial Statements and the notes thereto included elsewhere in this
joint proxy statement/prospectus.

   The Unaudited Pro Forma Combined Condensed Balance Sheet gives effect to the
proposed acquisition of Prime Response as if it occurred on December 31, 2000
and combines the Consolidated Balance Sheet of Chordiant as of December 31,
2000 and the Consolidated Balance Sheet of Prime Response as of
December 31, 2000. The Unaudited Pro Forma Combined Condensed Statement of
Operations for the year ended December 31, 2000 gives effect to the Prime

Unaudited Pro Forma Combined Condensed Statement of Operations of Chordiant for
the year ended December 31, 2000 combined with the Consolidated Statement of
Operations of Prime Response for the year ended December 31, 2000. The

December 31, 2000 combined with the unaudited results of operations of White
Spider Software, Inc. for the period from January 1, 2000 to July 18, 2000 as
if the White Spider acquisition occurred on January 1, 2000.

   The Unaudited Pro Forma Combined Condensed Financial Information is based on
estimates and assumptions, which are preliminary and have been made solely for
purposes of developing such pro forma information. The pro forma information is
presented for illustrative purposes only and is neither necessarily indicative
of the operating results or financial position that would have occurred if the
merger had been consummated on January 1, 2000, nor is it necessarily
indicative of the future operating results or financial position of Chordiant
following the merger.

   The Unaudited Pro Forma Combined Condensed Financial Information should be
read in conjunction with the historical consolidated financial statements of
Chordiant and Prime Response and related notes thereto, and "Chordiant

   The following table sets forth certain historical per share data of
Chordiant and Prime Response and combined per share data on an unaudited pro
forma basis after giving effect to the proposed merger, assuming that 0.60
share of Chordiant common stock will be issued in exchange for one share of
Prime Response common stock in the merger. This data should be read in
conjunction with the selected consolidated historical financial information,
the Unaudited Pro Forma Combined Condensed Financial Information, and the
separate consolidated historical financial statements of Chordiant and Prime
Response and notes thereto (which are included elsewhere in this joint proxy
statement/prospectus). The Unaudited Pro Forma Combined Condensed Financial

                                  RISK FACTORS

   You should consider the following risk factors in evaluating whether to
approve the issuance of shares of Chordiant common stock in the merger or the
adoption of the merger agreement. These factors should be considered in
conjunction with the other information included in this joint proxy
statement/prospectus.

Risks Relating to the Merger

 If Chordiant does not successfully integrate the business and technology of
 Prime Response and realize the expected benefits of the merger, it will have
 incurred significant costs, which may harm its business.

   Chordiant expects to incur costs and commit significant management time
integrating Prime Response's operations, technology, development programs,
products, clients and personnel. These costs may be substantial and may include
costs for:

  . integration of operations, including combining teams and processes in
    various functional areas;

  . fees and expenses of professionals and consultants involved in completing
    the integration process;

  . reorganization or closure of facilities;

  . incurring potential existing liabilities of Prime Response; and

  . integration of technology and products.

   If Chordiant does not realize the expected benefits of the merger,
Chordiant's financial results, including earnings per share, will be adversely
affected.

   Achieving the benefits of the merger will depend in part on the successful
integration of Prime Response's operations, technology, development programs,
products, clients and personnel in a timely and efficient manner and
maintaining Prime Response's relationships with key clients and strategic
partners. Integration efforts may be difficult and unpredictable because of
possible cultural conflicts and different opinions on technical decisions,
strategic plans, personnel and other decisions. Chordiant does not know whether
it will be successful in these integration efforts and cannot assure you that
it will realize the expected benefits of the merger. If Chordiant cannot
successfully integrate Prime Response's operations, technology, development
programs, products, clients and personnel and maintain Prime Response's
relationships with key clients and strategic partners, the combined company may
not realize the expected benefits of the merger and/or its business, financial
condition or results of operations may be seriously harmed.

 Integrating the business of Prime Response may divert the attention of the
 management of both Prime Response and Chordiant away from operations.

   Successful integration of Prime Response's operations, technology, products
and personnel will place a significant burden on the management and internal
resources of Chordiant and Prime Response. The diversion of the attention of
management of Chordiant and Prime Response and any difficulties encountered in
the transition and integration process could have a material adverse effect on
the future business, financial condition and operating results of the combined
company.

 Failure to retain key employees could diminish the benefits of the merger.

   The successful combination of Chordiant and Prime Response will depend in
part on the retention of key personnel. If key Chordiant or Prime Response
employees terminate their employment after the merger, Chordiant may not be
able to close existing sales opportunities, integrate Prime Response's products
into Chordiant's product line, complete existing Prime Response product
development projects or develop new product offerings. There can be no
assurance that Chordiant will be able to retain certain of Prime Response's key
management, technical, sales and customer support personnel. Failure to retain
such key personnel may

result in Chordiant not realizing the anticipated benefits of the merger
causing the future business, financial condition and operating results of the
combined company to be harmed.

 Because Prime Response stockholders will receive a fixed number of shares of
 Chordiant common stock in the merger, if the market price of Chordiant common
 stock declines, the value of the merger consideration received by Prime
 Response stockholders will be reduced.

   Each Prime Response stockholder will receive 0.60 of a share of Chordiant
common stock in exchange for each share of Prime Response common stock that
such stockholder owns. The fraction of a share of Chordiant common stock to be
issued for each share of Prime Response common stock is fixed and will not be
adjusted based upon changes in the value of Chordiant common stock or changes
in the value of Prime Response common stock. No fractional shares of Chordiant
common stock will be issued, and Prime Response stockholders will receive cash
in lieu of any fractional share of Chordiant common stock that they would
otherwise be entitled to receive in the merger.

   The value of the Chordiant shares that Prime Response stockholders will
receive in the merger will not be known until the time of completion of the
merger, and will change as the market price of Chordiant common stock goes up
or down prior to that time. In recent years, and particularly in recent months,
the stock market in general, and the securities of technology companies in
particular, have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations. These
market fluctuations have, and may in the future, adversely affect the market
price of Chordiant common stock. In addition, events or circumstances specific
to Chordiant could cause the price of its common stock to decline. See "Risk
Factors--Risks Relating to Chordiant." The market price of Chordiant common
stock upon and after completion of the merger could be lower than the market
price on the date of the merger agreement, the current market price and/or the
market price on the date of the special stockholder meeting or the date a Prime
Response stockholder votes on the adoption of the merger agreement. Prime
Response stockholders should obtain recent market quotations of Chordiant
common stock and Prime Response common stock before they vote on adoption of
the merger agreement.

 Failure to complete the merger could adversely affect Prime Response's and
 Chordiant's respective stock prices, future business and operations.

   If the merger is not completed for any reason, Prime Response and Chordiant
may be subject to a number of material risks, including the following:

  . the price of Prime Response and/or Chordiant common stock may decline to
    the extent that the market price prior to such termination reflects a
    market assumption that the merger will be completed; and

  . costs related to the merger, such as legal, accounting and financial
    advisor fees, must be paid even if the merger is not completed.

   In addition, Chordiant's or Prime Response's partners and customers, in
response to the announcement or pendency of the merger, may delay or defer
decisions to purchase products of either company or enter into business
relationships with either company. Any delay or deferral of those decisions by
partners and customers, or a decision by any of these parties to discontinue
its relationship with Prime Response or Chordiant, could have a material
adverse effect on the business of the relevant company. Similarly, until
Chordiant's plans with regard to Prime Response are announced or fully
executed, current and prospective Chordiant or Prime Response employees may
experience uncertainty about their future roles with Chordiant. For example,
Prime Response terminated approximately 15 employees during January 2001 and
there may be additional layoffs when the merger is completed. Furthermore,
recently James Carling, one of Prime Response's founders and Chief Technology
Officer, Peter J. Boni, Prime Response's President and Chief Executive Officer,
Paul Lavallee, Prime Response's President, Americas and Frederick Phillips,
Prime Response's Chief Financial Officer have tendered their resignations to
Prime Response. This may adversely affect Chordiant's or Prime Response's
ability to attract and retain key personnel or enter into business
relationships with prospective partners and/or customers.

 Failure to complete the merger may require Prime Response to pay Chordiant a
 termination fee and to reimburse Chordiant for its merger-related expenses.

   Prime Response may be required under certain circumstances to pay Chordiant
a termination fee of $1.0 million plus reimburse Chordiant for up to $2.0
million in merger-related expenses.

   Further, if the merger were terminated and the Prime Response board of
directors decided to seek another merger or business combination, there would
be no assurance that it would be able to find a partner willing to pay an
equivalent or more attractive price than the price to be paid in the merger. In
addition, while the merger agreement is in effect, subject to very narrowly
defined exceptions, Prime Response is prohibited from soliciting, initiating,
encouraging or entering into certain transactions such as a merger, sale of
assets or other business combination with any party other than Chordiant.

 The market price of Chordiant common stock may decline as a result of the
 merger.

   The market price of Chordiant common stock may decline as a result of the
merger if:

  . the integration of the business and operations of Prime Response is
    unsuccessful;

  . Chordiant does not achieve the perceived benefits and cost savings of the
    merger as rapidly or to the extent anticipated by securities analysts or
    investors;

  . Chordiant or Prime Response incurs liabilities that are not anticipated
    or greater than expected by either company's securities analysts or
    investors; or

  . the effect of the merger on financial results is not consistent with the
    expectations of securities analysts or investors.

 Both Chordiant and Prime Response must complete the merger even if a material
 adverse effect on the business, financial condition or results of operations
 of either company occurs prior to the consummation of the merger.

   Pursuant to the terms of the merger agreement, both Chordiant and Prime
Response would have to consummate the merger even if during the pre-closing
period and after the respective special meetings of stockholders, a change,
effect, event, occurrence, state of facts or development occurs that has had or
could reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on the business,
financial condition or results of operations of Prime Response and its
subsidiaries or Chordiant and its subsidiaries. For example, if either
company's quarterly revenues or operating results fall below the expectations
of securities analysts, this event, in and of itself, would not allow either
Chordiant or Prime Response to not complete the merger.

 Prime Response's officers and directors have conflicts of interest that may
 have influenced them to recommend the adoption of the merger agreement.

   The directors and officers of Prime Response participate in arrangements and
have continuing indemnification against liabilities that provide them with
interests in the merger that are different from, or in addition to other Prime
Response stockholders including the following:

  . Pursuant to employment agreements with Prime Response, a number of
    executives of Prime Response will receive certain severance or other
    benefits in connection with the merger, including the payment of salary,
    benefits and the acceleration of vesting of options. Please see "The
    Merger--Interests of Prime Response's Officers and Directors in the
    Merger" and "Prime Response Management--Employment Agreements" for a more
    complete description of these agreements.

  . Chordiant has agreed to cause the surviving corporation in the merger to
    indemnify each present and former Prime Response officer and director
    against liabilities arising out of such person's services as an officer
    or director. Chordiant will cause the surviving corporation to maintain
    officers' and directors' liability insurance to cover any such
    liabilities for the next three years.

   For the above reasons, the directors and officers of Prime Response could
be more likely to vote for the adoption of the merger agreement than if they
did not hold these interests. Prime Response stockholders should consider
whether these interests may have influenced these directors and officers to
support or recommend adoption of the merger agreement.

Risks Relating to Chordiant

 Because Chordiant's short operating history makes it difficult to evaluate
 its prospects, Chordiant's future financial performance may disappoint
 investors and result in a decline in Chordiant's stock price.

   You must consider Chordiant's prospects given the risks, expenses and
challenges Chordiant might encounter because the company is at an early stage
of development and growth in a new and rapidly evolving market. Until
September 1997, Chordiant was engaged primarily in the research and
development of its software products. Chordiant licensed its first product in
September 1997 and Chordiant's sales and service organizations are relatively
new and still growing. Due to Chordiant's short operating history, Chordiant's
future financial performance is not predictable and may disappoint investors
and result in a substantial decline in Chordiant's stock price. The revenue
and income potential of Chordiant's products are unproven.

 Chordiant expects to continue to incur losses and may not achieve or maintain
 profitability, which may cause Chordiant's stock price to decline.

   Chordiant incurred net losses of $35.4 million for the year ended December
31, 2000. As of December 31, 2000, Chordiant had an accumulated deficit of
$97.9 million. Chordiant expects to continue to incur losses on both a
quarterly and annual basis at least through the first half of 2001. Moreover,
Chordiant expects to continue to incur significant sales and marketing and
research and development expenses and expenses to establish additional sales
offices domestically and internationally, and, as a result, Chordiant will
need to generate significant revenues to achieve and maintain profitability.
Chordiant cannot be certain that Chordiant can sustain this growth or that it
will generate sufficient revenues to achieve profitability.

 Chordiant's operating results fluctuate significantly and an unanticipated
 decline in revenues may disappoint investors and result in a decline in
 Chordiant's stock price.

   Chordiant's quarterly revenues will depend primarily upon product
implementation by its customers. Chordiant has historically recognized most of
the company's license and services revenue using the percentage-of-completion
method using labor hours incurred as the measure of progress towards
completion of implementation of Chordiant's products and Chordiant expects
this practice to continue. Thus, delays in implementation by Chordiant
customers and system integration partners will reduce Chordiant's quarterly
revenue. Historically, a substantial portion of new customer orders have been
booked in the third month of the calendar quarter, with a concentration of
these bookings in the last two weeks of the third month. Chordiant expects
this trend to continue and, therefore, any failure or delay in bookings would
decrease Chordiant's quarterly deferred revenue. If Chordiant's revenues or
operating margins are below the expectations of any securities analysts that
may analyze Chordiant, or investors, Chordiant's stock price is likely to
decline.

 Chordiant has limited experience with large-scale deployments and if
 Chordiant's products do not successfully operate in a company-wide
 environment, Chordiant may lose sales and suffer decreased revenues.

   If existing customers have difficulty deploying Chordiant's products or
choose not to fully deploy the products, particularly in large-scale
deployments, it could damage Chordiant's reputation and reduce revenues.
Chordiant's success requires that the company's products be highly scalable,
or able to accommodate substantial increases in the number of users. To date,
no large-scale deployment has been operating at any customer site and
Chordiant's products are currently being used by only a limited number of
users. Chordiant's

products are expected to be deployed on a variety of computer hardware
platforms and to be used in connection with a number of third-party software
applications by personnel who may not have previously used application
software systems or Chordiant's products. These deployments present very
significant technical challenges, which are difficult or impossible to
predict.

 Failure to successfully customize or implement Chordiant's products for a
 customer could prevent recognition of revenues, collection of amounts due or
 cause legal claims by the customer.

   If a customer is not able to customize or deploy Chordiant's products
successfully, the customer may not complete expected product deployment, which
would prevent recognition of revenues and collection of amounts due, and could
result in claims against Chordiant. Chordiant has, in the past, had disputes
with customers concerning product performance. One dispute, from a 1995
consulting agreement, resulted in a settlement following contractually-
required mediation. One, from a 1997 product license, resulted in a settlement
following litigation. One, from a product license and related service
agreements, was resolved in February, 2000 when the company entered into a new
agreement with the client, Chase Manhattan Mortgage Corporation. For further
details regarding the Chase dispute, see "Chordiant Management's Discussion
and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" contained
elsewhere in this joint proxy statement/prospectus.

 Chordiant's primary products have a long sales and implementation cycle,
 which makes it difficult to predict Chordiant's quarterly results and may
 cause operating results to vary significantly.

   The period between initial contact with a prospective customer and the
implementation of Chordiant's products is unpredictable and often lengthy,
ranging to date from three to twenty-four months. Thus, deferred revenue could
vary significantly from quarter to quarter. Any delays in the implementation
of Chordiant's products could cause reductions in Chordiant's revenues. The
licensing of Chordiant's products is often an enterprise-wide decision that
generally requires Chordiant to provide a significant level of education to
prospective customers about the use and benefits of Chordiant's products. The
implementation of Chordiant's products involves significant commitment of
technical and financial resources and is commonly associated with substantial
implementation efforts that may be performed by Chordiant, by the customer or
by third-party system integrators. Customers generally consider a wide range
of issues before committing to purchase Chordiant's products, including
product benefits, ability to operate with existing and future computer
systems, ability to accommodate increased transaction volume and product
reliability.

 Because a small number of customers account for a substantial portion of
 Chordiant's software license revenues, Chordiant's revenues could decline if
 Chordiant loses a major customer.

   Chordiant derives a significant portion of its software license revenues in
each quarter from a limited number of customers. Loss of a major customer in a
particular quarter could cause a decrease in revenue, deferred revenues and
net income. For the year ended December 31, 2000, revenues from Electronic
Data Systems Corporation (EDS), Lloyds TSB and Direct Line Group Services
Limited accounted for approximately 30%, 19% and 14% of Chordiant's total net
revenues. For the fiscal year ended December 31, 1999, revenues from Chase
Manhattan Mortgage Corporation, First USA and EDS accounted for 30%, 19%, and
15% of Chordiant's total net revenues. Chordiant expects that a limited number
of customers will continue to account for a substantial portion of the
company's revenues. As a result, if Chordiant loses a major customer, if a
contract is delayed or cancelled, Chordiant's revenues would be adversely
affected. In addition, customers that have accounted for significant revenues
in the past may not generate revenues in any future period causing Chordiant's
failure to obtain new significant customers or additional orders from existing
customers to materially affect Chordiant's operating results.

 Defects in Chordiant's products could diminish demand for Chordiant's products
 and result in decreased revenues, decreased market acceptance and injury to
 Chordiant's reputation.

   Errors may be found from time to time in Chordiant's new or enhanced
products after commencement of commercial shipments resulting in decreased
revenues, decreased sales, injury to Chordiant's reputation and/or increased
warranty and repair costs. Although Chordiant conducts extensive product
testing during product development, Chordiant has in the past discovered
software errors in Chordiant's products as well as in third party products, and
as a result has experienced delays in the shipment of its new products. The
latest version of Chordiant's primary product suite was introduced in June
2000.

 Chordiant's failure to maintain strong relationships with system integrators
 would harm Chordiant's ability to market and implement Chordiant's products
 and reduce future revenues.

   Failure to establish or maintain relationships with systems integrators
would significantly harm Chordiant's ability to license Chordiant's software
products. System integrators install and deploy Chordiant's products, in
addition to those of Chordiant's competitors, and perform custom integration of
systems and applications. Some system integrators also engage in joint
marketing and sales efforts with Chordiant. If these relationships fail,
Chordiant will have to devote substantially more resources to the sales and
marketing, implementation and support of Chordiant's products than it would
have to otherwise. Chordiant's efforts may also not be as effective as those of
the system integrators, which could reduce revenues. In many cases, these
parties have extensive relationships with Chordiant's existing and potential
customers and influence the decisions of these customers. A number of
Chordiant's competitors have stronger relationships with these system
integrators and, as a result, these system integrators may be more likely to
recommend competitors' products and services.

   In particular, Chordiant has established a non-exclusive relationship with
Electronic Data Systems Corporation, or EDS, a large system integrator and one
of Chordiant's principal stockholders. For the fiscal year ended December 31,
2000 and the fiscal year ended December 31, 1999, approximately 30% and 15%,
respectively, of Chordiant's revenues were derived from customers for whom
Electronic Data Systems has been engaged to provide software and system
integration services. Deterioration of Chordiant's relationship with Electronic
Data Systems could have a material adverse effect on sales of Chordiant's
products.

 To date, Chordiant's sales have been concentrated in the financial services,
 travel and leisure, automotive and telecommunications markets and if Chordiant
 is unable to continue sales in these markets or successfully penetrate new
 markets, Chordiant's revenues may decline.

   Sales of Chordiant's products and services in four markets--financial
services, travel and leisure, automotive and telecommunications--accounted for
86% of total net revenues for the year ended December 31, 2000 and 87% of total
net revenues for the fiscal year ended December 31, 1999. Chordiant expects
that revenues from these four markets will continue to account for a
substantial portion of Chordiant's total net revenues in 2001. If Chordiant is
unable to successfully increase penetration of Chordiant's existing markets or
achieve sales in additional markets, or if the overall economic climate of
Chordiant's target markets deteriorates, Chordiant's revenues may decline.

 Continued negative gross margin in services revenues could adversely impact
 Chordiant's overall gross margin and income.

   Chordiant's gross margin in services revenues has historically been
negative. Service revenues have also had lower gross margins than Chordiant's
license revenues. As a result, an increase in the percentage of total net
revenues represented by services revenues, or an unexpected decrease in license
revenues, could have a detrimental impact on Chordiant's overall gross margins.
Chordiant anticipates that service revenues will continue to represent over 30%
of total net revenues. To increase services revenues, Chordiant must expand
Chordiant's services organization, successfully recruit and train a sufficient
number of qualified services personnel, and obtain renewals of current
maintenance contracts by Chordiant's customers. This expansion could further
reduce gross margins in Chordiant's service revenues.

 Because competition for qualified personnel is intense, Chordiant may not be
 able to retain or recruit personnel, which could impact the development and
 sales of Chordiant's products.

   If Chordiant is unable to hire or retain qualified personnel, or if newly
hired personnel fails to develop the necessary skills or fails to reach
expected levels of productivity, Chordiant's ability to develop and market
Chordiant's products will be weakened. Chordiant's success depends largely on
the continued contributions of Chordiant's key management, engineering, sales
and marketing and professional services personnel, including Samuel T.
Spadafora, Chordiant's chairman of the board of directors and chief executive
officer and Stephen Kelly, Chordiant's president and chief operating officer.
Except for Chordiant's chief executive officer and president and chief
operating officer, Chordiant does not have employment agreements with any of
Chordiant's key personnel. Chordiant has experienced turnover in Chordiant's
key personnel in the recent past.

   In particular, Chordiant's ability to increase Chordiant's sales will
depend on Chordiant's ability to recruit, train and retain top quality sales
people who are able to target prospective customers' senior management, and
who can productively generate and service large accounts. There is a shortage
of qualified sales personnel and competition for such personnel is intense,
particularly in the Silicon Valley where Chordiant's principal offices are
located and in the markets in which Chordiant competes.

 Chordiant depends on technology licensed to Chordiant by third parties, and
 the loss or inability to maintain these licenses could prevent or delay sales
 of Chordiant's products.

   Chordiant licenses technology from several software providers that is
incorporated in Chordiant's products. In particular, Chordiant licenses Forte
Tool and related Forte products from Forte Software, Inc., a Sun Microsystems,
Inc. company. Chordiant's license agreement with Forte expires in September
2001, and can be extended upon agreement of the parties. Chordiant anticipates
that Chordiant will continue to license technology from Forte and other third
parties in the future. This software may not continue to be available on
commercially reasonable terms, if at all. The loss of the Forte technology or
other technology licenses could result in delays in the license of Chordiant's
products until equivalent technology, if available, is developed or
identified, licensed and integrated into Chordiant's products. Even if
substitute technologies are available, there can be no guarantee that
Chordiant will be able to license these technologies on commercially
reasonable terms, if at all.

 Defects in third party products associated with Chordiant's products could
 impair Chordiant's products' functionality and injure Chordiant's reputation.

   The effective implementation of Chordiant's products depends upon the
successful operation of third party products in conjunction with Chordiant's
products. Any undetected errors in these products could prevent the
implementation or impair the functionality of Chordiant's products, delay new
product introductions or injure Chordiant's reputation. In the past, while
Chordiant's business has not been materially harmed, product releases have
been delayed as a result of errors in third-party software and Chordiant has
incurred significant expenses fixing and investigating the cause of these
errors.

 Chordiant's customers and system integration partners have the ability to
 alter Chordiant's source code and inappropriate alterations could adversely
 affect the performance of Chordiant's products, cause injury to Chordiant's
 reputation and increase operating expenses.

   Customers and system integration partners have access to Chordiant's
computer source code when they license Chordiant's products and may alter the
source code. Alteration may lead to implementation, operation, technical
support and upgrade problems for Chordiant's customers. This could adversely
affect the market acceptance of Chordiant's products, and any necessary
investigative work and repairs could cause Chordiant to incur significant
expenses and delays in implementation.

 If Chordiant fails to introduce new versions and releases of Chordiant's
 products in a timely manner, customers may license competing products and
 Chordiant's revenues may decline.

   If Chordiant is unable to ship or implement enhancements to Chordiant's
products when planned, or fails to achieve timely market acceptance of these
enhancements, Chordiant may suffer lost sales and could fail to achieve
anticipated revenues. A majority of Chordiant's total revenues have been, and
are expected to be, derived from the license of Chordiant's primary product
suite. Chordiant's future operating results will depend

on the demand for these products by future customers, including new and
enhanced releases that are subsequently introduced. If Chordiant's competitors
release new products that are superior to Chordiant's products in performance
or price, or if Chordiant fails to enhance Chordiant's products and introduce
new features and functionality in a timely manner, demand for Chordiant's
products may decline. Chordiant has in the past experienced delays in the
planned release dates of new versions of Chordiant's software products and
upgrades. New versions or Chordiant's products may not be released on schedule
or may contain defects when released.

 If Chordiant's products do not operate with the hardware and software
 platforms used by Chordiant's customers, customers may license competing
 products and Chordiant's revenues will decline.

   If Chordiant's products fail to satisfy advancing technological
requirements, the market acceptance of these products could be reduced.
Chordiant currently serves a customer base with a wide variety of constantly
changing hardware, software applications and networking platforms. Customer
acceptance of Chordiant's products depends on many factors such as:

  . Chordiant's ability to integrate Chordiant's products with multiple
    platforms and existing or legacy systems;

  . Chordiant's ability to anticipate and support new standards, especially
    Internet and enterprise Java standards; and

  . the integration of additional software modules and third party software
    applications with Chordiant's existing products.

 Chordiant's reliance on international operations may cause increased operating
 expenses and cause Chordiant's net income to decline.

   During the fiscal year ended December 31, 2000, international revenues were
$25.8 million or approximately 77% of Chordiant's total net revenues. During
the fiscal year ended December 31, 1999, international revenues were $6.6
million or approximately 38% of Chordiant's total net revenues. Chordiant
expects international revenues will continue to represent a significant portion
of Chordiant's total net revenues in future periods.

   Chordiant has faced, and will continue to face, risks associated with:

  . difficulties in managing Chordiant's widespread operations;

  . difficulties in hiring qualified local personnel;

  . seasonal fluctuations in customer orders;

  . longer accounts receivable collection cycles;

  . expenses associated with products used in foreign markets;

  . currency fluctuation and hedging activities; and

  . economic downturns in international economies.

   Any of these factors could have a significant impact on Chordiant's ability
to license products on a competitive and timely basis and adversely affect
Chordiant's operating expenses and net income.

   Chordiant's international sales are both U.S. dollar and local currency
denominated. As a result, an increase in the value of the U.S. dollar relative
to foreign currencies could make Chordiant's products less competitive in
international markets and could negatively affect Chordiant's operating results
and cash flows.

 International expansion could be difficult and Chordiant may not achieve sales
 growth.

   If Chordiant is unable to expand Chordiant's international operations and
sales, and build relationships with third parties outside the United States on
a timely basis, Chordiant may not achieve anticipated sales growth. Chordiant
has expanded, and intends to continue expanding, its international operations
and enter additional international markets. In October 1997, Chordiant opened
an office in London, England and during 1999 and 2000, Chordiant opened offices
in the Netherlands and Germany. To increase Chordiant's international sales
opportunities, Chordiant will need to further develop Chordiant's international
sales, professional services and support organizations, and Chordiant will need
to form additional relationships with system integration partners worldwide.

 Chordiant's failure to integrate successfully Chordiant's acquired companies
 could prevent Chordiant from operating efficiently.

   On July 19, 2000, Chordiant completed an acquisition of White Spider
Software, Inc., an early stage software company that has completed development
of a beta version of a knowledge management software product. Upon the closing
date, White Spider became a wholly-owned subsidiary of Chordiant. Chordiant's
business strategy includes pursuing opportunities to grow Chordiant's business,
both internally and through selective acquisitions and various types of
business combinations. To implement this strategy, Chordiant may in the future
be involved in additional merger and acquisition transactions like the
acquisition of Prime Response. Acquisition transactions are motivated by many
factors, including Chordiant's desire to acquire skilled personnel, Chordiant's
desire to obtain new technologies and Chordiant's desire to expand and enhance
Chordiant's product offerings. Growth through acquisitions has several
identifiable risks including difficulties associated with successfully
integrating the previously distinct businesses into Chordiant's organization,
the substantial management time devoted to integrating the companies, the
possibility that Chordiant might not be successful in retaining the employees
of the acquired companies, undisclosed liabilities, the failure to realize
anticipated benefits (such as cost savings and synergies) and issues related to
integrating acquired technology or content into Chordiant's products and media
properties (such as unanticipated expenses). Realization of any of these risks
in connection with any mergers or acquisitions Chordiant has entered into, or
may enter into, could have a material adverse effect on Chordiant's business,
operating results and financial condition.

 Competition in Chordiant's markets is intense and could reduce Chordiant's
 sales and prevent Chordiant from achieving profitability.

   Increased competition is likely to result in price reductions, reduced gross
margins and loss of market share, any one of which could reduce Chordiant's
future revenues. The market for Chordiant's products is intensely competitive,
evolving and subject to rapid technological change. The intensity of
competition is expected to increase in the future. Chordiant's current
competitors include:

  . Internal information technology departments: In-house information
    technology departments of potential customers have developed or may
    develop systems that provide some or all of the functionality of
    Chordiant's products. Chordiant expects that internally developed
    application integration and process automation efforts will continue to
    be a significant source of competition.

  . Point application vendors: Chordiant competes with providers of stand-
    alone point solutions for Web- based customer relationship management and
    traditional client/server-based, call-center service customer and
    salesforce automation solution providers.

   Many of Chordiant's competitors have greater resources and broader customer
relationships than Chordiant does. In addition, many of these competitors have
extensive knowledge of Chordiant's industry. Current and

potential competitors have established, or may establish, cooperative
relationships among themselves or with third parties to offer a single solution
and increase the ability of their products to address customer needs.

 If Chordiant is unable to protect Chordiant's intellectual property, Chordiant
 may lose a valuable asset or incur costly litigation to protect Chordiant's
 rights.

   Chordiant's success and ability to compete depends upon Chordiant's
proprietary technology. Chordiant relies on trademark, trade secret and
copyright laws to protect Chordiant's intellectual property. Chordiant has no
patents or patent applications. Chordiant ships source code to Chordiant's
customers and third party system integrators and partners are given access to
it. Despite Chordiant's efforts to protect Chordiant's intellectual property, a
third party could copy or obtain the source code to Chordiant's software or
other proprietary information without authorization and/or could develop
software competitive to the company's. Chordiant's means of protecting
Chordiant's proprietary rights may not be adequate and Chordiant's competitors
may independently develop similar technology or duplicate Chordiant's products.

   Chordiant may have to litigate to enforce Chordiant's intellectual property
rights, to protect Chordiant's trade secrets or know-how or to determine their
scope, validity or enforceability. Enforcing or defending Chordiant's
proprietary technology is expensive, could cause the diversion of Chordiant's
resources and may not prove successful. Chordiant's protective measures may
prove inadequate to protect Chordiant's proprietary rights. If Chordiant is
unable to protect Chordiant's intellectual property, Chordiant may lose a
valuable asset or incur costly litigation to protect Chordiant's rights.

 If Chordiant becomes subject to intellectual property infringement claims,
 these claims could be costly and time-consuming to defend, divert management's
 attention and cause product delays, and have an adverse effect on Chordiant's
 revenues and net income.

   Chordiant expects that software product developers and providers of software
in markets similar to Chordiant's target markets will increasingly be subject
to infringement claims as the number of products and competitors in Chordiant's
industry grows and the functionality of products overlaps. Any claims, with or
without merit, could be costly and time-consuming to defend, divert Chordiant's
management's attention, or cause product delays. Chordiant has no patents or
patent applications that Chordiant could use defensively against any company
bringing such a claim. If any of Chordiant's products were found to infringe a
third party's proprietary rights, Chordiant could be required to enter into
royalty or licensing agreements to be able to sell Chordiant's products.
Royalty and licensing agreements, if required, may not be available on terms
acceptable to Chordiant or at all.

 Chordiant's stock price is subject to significant fluctuations.

   Since Chordiant's initial public offering in February 2000, the price of
Chordiant's common stock has fluctuated widely. Chordiant believes that factors
such as the risks described herein or other factors could cause the price of
its common stock to fluctuate, perhaps substantially. In addition, recently,
the stock market, in general, and the market for high technology stocks in
particular, has experienced extreme price fluctuations, which have often been
unrelated to the operating performance of the affected companies. Such
fluctuations could adversely affect the market price of Chordiant's common
stock.

Risks Relating to Prime Response

 Prime Response has incurred substantial operating losses and may not be
 profitable in the future.

   Prime Response is subject to risks and uncertainties common to growing
technology-based companies, including rapid technological developments,
reliance on continued development and acceptance of the Internet, intense
competition and a limited operating history. In 1995, Prime Response began to
transition from a marketing database service bureau to a software company.
Since that time, Prime Response has incurred

substantial operating losses. Prime Response cannot be certain if or when it
will become profitable. Furthermore, Prime Response expects to incur net
losses and negative operating cash flow on both a quarterly and annual basis
for the foreseeable future. As a result, Prime Response will need to generate
significant revenues to achieve and maintain profitability.

 If the merger with Chordiant does not close, Prime Response may need to find
 additional capital in order to continue to support its business.

   Prime Response believes that its existing balance of cash and cash
equivalents will be sufficient to meet its working capital and anticipated
capital expenditure needs for at least the next 12 months. In the event that
the impending merger with Chordiant does not close, Prime Response may require
additional sources of funds to continue to support its business. There can be
no assurance that such capital, if needed, will be available or will be
available on terms which Prime Response finds acceptable.

 Prime Response's quarterly operating results may fluctuate because it depends
 on a relatively small number of large orders.

   Prime Response derives a significant portion of its software license
revenues in each quarter from a relatively small number of relatively large
orders. The criteria for a client's acceptance of a product may delay Prime
Response's ability to recognize revenue from the products Prime Response
delivers in any particular quarter. Prime Response's operating results for a
particular fiscal period could be materially adversely affected if it is
unable to complete those transactions, or satisfy a client's acceptance
criteria on schedule or at anticipated performance levels. Although Prime
Response has experienced revenue growth in recent periods, it cannot be
certain that these growth rates will be sustainable or that Prime Response
will ever generate revenues at a level sufficient to cover its anticipated
expenses, if at all.

 Disappointing quarterly revenues or operating results could cause the price
 of Prime Response common stock to fall.

   Prime Response's quarterly revenues and operating results are difficult to
predict and may fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter. Therefore,
you should not rely on period-to-period comparisons of revenues or results of
operations as an indication of future performance. Recently, Prime Response's
quarterly revenues and operating results have fallen below the expectations of
investors and securities analysts. If this trend were to continue, the price
of Prime Response common stock could decline.

 Prime Response's quarterly license revenues may fluctuate as a result of a
 variety of factors, including the following:

  . software license revenues in any quarter depend on contracts being
    consummated, orders delivered and the satisfaction of any existing client
    acceptance criteria in that quarter;

  . the market in which Prime Response competes is relatively new and rapidly
    evolving;

  . Prime Response expects that, for the foreseeable future, revenues will
    come primarily from software licenses with a relatively small number of
    clients, so delays, cancellations of orders, or non-acceptance of its
    software by a few clients can significantly impact revenues within a
    quarter;

  . Prime Response's sales and implementation cycle is relatively long; and

  . revenues will be affected by the timing of the introduction of new
    products, new product platforms or product enhancements by Prime Response
    or its competitors.

   Any decline in license revenues is also likely to cause a decline in Prime
Response's services and support revenues in the same quarter or in subsequent
quarters.

 If Prime Response's products cannot be successfully installed or operated,
 Prime Response could be prevented from recognizing revenues, collecting
 amounts due or become subject to legal claims by the client.

   If Prime Response's products cannot be successfully installed or operated,
Prime Response's clients may not complete expected product deployment, which
may prevent fulfillment of acceptance criteria and accordingly affect the
recognition of revenues, the collection of amounts due or could result in legal
claims being brought against Prime Response by its clients.

 Prime Response's product has a relatively long sales and implementation cycle,
 which makes it difficult to predict its quarterly results and may cause
 operating results to vary significantly.

   The period between initial contact with a prospective client and the
implementation of Prime Response's product is unpredictable and often
relatively lengthy, averaging approximately six months. Any delays in the
installation or operation of Prime Response's product could cause reductions or
deferrals in its revenues. The licensing of Prime Response's products can be an
enterprise-wide decision that generally requires Prime Response to provide a
significant level of education to prospective clients about the use and
benefits of its products. The implementation of Prime Response's products
involves significant commitment of resources and is commonly associated with
implementation efforts that may be performed by Prime Response, by the client
or by third-party system integrators. The typical Prime Response client
generally considers a wide range of issues before committing to purchase Prime
Response's products, including product benefits, ability to operate with
existing and future computer systems, ability to accommodate increased
transaction volume and product reliability.

 Seasonal trends may cause Prime Response's quarterly operating results to
 fluctuate, which may adversely affect the market price of Prime Response
 common stock.

   Due to the fact that Prime Response does a significant percentage of its
business in Europe, which typically experiences a slowdown in business during
the summer months and because its products typically involve a significant
initial investment, the availability of which is often dependent on a client's
fiscal period, Prime Response may experience seasonal fluctuations in quarterly
revenues and operating results. If Prime Response consistently experiences
these revenue fluctuations, securities analysts and investors may not be able
to predict Prime Response's quarterly or annual operating results. Failure to
meet the expectations of securities analysts or investors could result in a
decline in the price of Prime Response common stock.

 Prime Response's results of operations would be adversely affected if its
 investments in personnel and infrastructure do not correspond with the timing
 of revenue generated as a result of such investments.

   Most of Prime Response's expenses, such as employee compensation, sales and
marketing expenses, computer equipment costs and rent for properties, are
either relatively fixed in the short term or incurred in advance of sales. In
addition, Prime Response's expense levels are based in part on its expectations
regarding future revenues. As a result, if revenues for a particular quarter
are below expectations, Prime Response will most likely not be able to
proportionately reduce operating expenses for that quarter. Therefore, a
shortfall in revenues would have a disproportionate effect on its expected
operating results for that quarter and could cause the trading price of Prime
Response common stock to decline.

 Prime Response may incur charges against its earnings which could have an
 adverse impact on results of operations.

   Prime Response has issued warrants to purchase shares of the common stock of
Prime Response to Accenture (formerly known as Andersen Consulting) which
become exercisable upon the attainment of certain revenue targets and market
capitalization levels. Because Prime Response cannot predict if and when these
targets will be attained, it cannot predict when charges to expenses related to
these warrants will be incurred. Furthermore, the amount of these charges will
depend on the price of Prime Response common stock when the

warrants are earned. During the year ended December 31, 2000, Prime Response
has incurred non-cash sales and marketing expenses of $176,000, respectively,
in connection with these warrants. As a result of these non-cash expenses, any
quarter in which Prime Response incurs charges in connection with the issuance
of these warrants could result in Prime Response having operating results
lower than those expected by securities analysts or investors which could
cause the price of Prime Response common stock to decline.

 Prime Response has recently released new products and is dependent on their
 market acceptance to achieve Prime Response's revenue goals.

   Prime Response has released new products based upon Prime@Vantage, its pre-
existing software architecture. Achievement of Prime Response's overall
business goals is dependent upon the sustained market acceptance at desired
pricing levels of these new products as well as their ability to perform at
expected levels. If these products do not achieve and sustain market
acceptance due to bugs, a lack of functionality considered important in the
marketplace or any other reason, Prime Response will experience a material
adverse effect on its business, prospects, operating results and financial
condition and may become subject to litigation or claims from clients.

 Prime Response's clients may not elect to migrate to the Prime@Vantage
 architecture and may require Prime Response to support Prime Response's old
 software architecture.

   Recently, Prime Response has notified its clients operating the Prime
Vantage software product on an Oracle platform that it will no longer support
such product after March 31, 2001. Accordingly, clients who do not elect to
migrate to the Prime@Vantage architecture may seek to force Prime Response to
support the old software architecture resulting in a possible delay in new
product acceptance which could affect Prime Response's operating results.

 Prime Response's failure to increase its North American revenues and
 operations would adversely affect its operating results and financial
 condition.

   Prime Response believes that it must expand its sales activities,
partnership relationships, product and service offerings and operations in
North America in order to achieve and maintain profitability. Prime Response's
failure to effectively manage expansion in North America could have a material
adverse effect on the delivery of its products and services, its ability to
attract and retain key personnel and its business operations and prospects.

 Prime Response may not be able to continue to develop new products or enhance
 existing products on a timely basis.

   To be competitive, Prime Response must continue to develop and introduce on
a timely basis new products and product enhancements. Prime Response's failure
to develop and introduce new products and enhancements successfully and on a
timely basis, or the failure of new products to achieve and sustain market
acceptance, could have a material adverse effect on its business, prospects,
operating results and financial condition. Prime Response is obligated under a
limited number of client contracts to deliver new products or product
enhancements by specified dates, and failure to do so could result in the loss
of one or more of those clients or expose Prime Response to contractual
liability.

 Competition in the marketplace may adversely affect Prime Response's
 financial condition and operating results.

   The market for Internet-based integrated relationship marketing solutions
is competitive. This competition is likely to lead to price reductions,
reduced gross margins and loss of market share, any of which could reduce
Prime Response's future revenues. Some of Prime Response's current and
potential competitors have greater

name recognition and substantially greater financial, technical, marketing,
management, service, support and other resources than Prime Response has.
Therefore, these competitive advantages may enable Prime Response's
competitors to respond more quickly than Prime Response can to new or changing
opportunities, technologies, standards or client requirements.

   In addition, Prime Response expects that new competitors will enter the
market with competing products as the size and visibility of the market
opportunity increases. Prime Response also expects that competition will
increase as a result of consolidations and formations of alliances among
industry participants. Increased competition could result in additional
pricing pressures, further reduced margins and the failure of Prime Response's
products to achieve or maintain market acceptance.

 Prime Response depends on specific industries for most of its sales, and it
 may not continue to be successful in those markets and in expanding beyond
 those limited industries.

   A substantial portion of Prime Response's revenues have been derived from
sales to financial institutions and communications and media companies. In
order to reach and maintain profitability, Prime Response must continue to
succeed in these markets as well as penetrate additional markets, including,
but not limited to the consumer goods market. Prime Response may not be
successful in penetrating such additional markets.

 If Prime Response is unable to manage its growth and the related expansion in
 its operations effectively, its business may be harmed.

   Prime Response's ability to successfully offer products and services and
implement its business plan in a rapidly evolving market requires effective
planning and management. Prime Response's growth has placed, and its
anticipated future operations will continue to place, a significant strain on
its management, information systems, network and other resources. To manage
future growth effectively, Prime Response must continue to improve its
financial and accounting systems and controls, enhance its reporting systems
and procedures, integrate new personnel and manage expanded operations. Prime
Response will also need to hire additional personnel and it may be unable to
recruit qualified employees as needed.

 Prime Response is largely dependent on its international operations.

   In addition to Prime Response's presence in the North America, it has
offices in five other countries and customers in more than 15 other countries.
In the year ended December 31, 1999, and the year ended December 31, 2000, 83%
and 64% of its total revenues, respectively, resulted from sales outside North
America, reflecting its historical presence in the United Kingdom and
elsewhere in Europe and the Asia-Pacific. Although Prime Response believes
that it must increase its sales in North America to reach and maintain
profitability, it must also continue to expand its sales in international
markets for its business to grow as planned. This may require Prime Response
to establish additional international operations and hire additional
personnel. If Prime Response fails to do so in a timely and effective manner
its business and revenues would not grow as planned, its operations and its
plans to expand internationally could be affected by a number of risks,
including:

  . challenges inherent in managing geographically dispersed operations;

  . the need to develop local distribution channels through third parties;

  . multiple, conflicting and changing governmental laws and regulations; and

  . foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations.

 Failure to expand Prime Response's relationships with consulting firms and
 systems integrators would impede acceptance of its products and growth of its
 revenues.

   Consultants, systems integrators, and service providers who recommend,
install and support Prime Response's products with their clients are a
contributing source of its sales. To increase its revenues and

implementation capabilities, Prime Response must continue to develop and expand
relationships with consultants, systems integrators, service providers and
other potential industry partners. A failure to do so would reduce its ability
to generate increased revenues. Consultants, systems integrators and service
providers may market or recommend products that compete with Prime Response's
products. Moreover, if these firms fail to implement Prime Response's products
successfully for their clients, Prime Response may not have the resources to
implement its products on the schedule required by the client, which could
affect its ability to generate increased revenues.

 Prime Response's business will be adversely affected if Internet solutions and
 wireless marketing are not widely adopted.

   Because Prime Response's new products address the emerging market for
Internet marketing solutions and wireless applications, its future success
depends in part upon the widespread adoption of the Internet and wireless
communications as primary mediums for commerce and business applications. The
failure of these markets to develop, or a delay in the development of these
markets, would have a material adverse effect on its ability to generate
revenues and grow its businesses. The Internet has experienced, and is expected
to continue to experience, significant user and traffic growth, which has, at
times, caused user frustration with slow access and download times. The
Internet infrastructure may not be able to support the demands placed on it by
the continued growth upon which Prime Response's success in part depends.
Moreover, critical issues concerning the commercial use of the Internet, such
as security, reliability, cost, accessibility, taxation of e-commerce and
quality of service, remain unresolved and may negatively affect the growth of
Internet use or the attractiveness of commerce and business communication over
the Internet. In addition, the Internet could suffer declines in its viability
due to delays in the development or adoption of new standards and protocols to
handle increased activity or due to increased government regulation and
taxation of Internet commerce.

 Prime Response's revenues might be harmed by a client's internal information
 technology department's resistance to adopting Prime Response's software
 products.

   Some businesses may have already made a substantial investment in other
third-party or internally developed software designed to integrate data from
disparate sources and analyze this data or manage marketing campaigns. These
businesses may be reluctant to abandon these investments in favor of Prime
Response's software. In addition, information technology departments of
potential clients may resist purchasing Prime Response's software for a variety
of other reasons, particularly the potential displacement of their historical
role in creating and running software and concerns that packaged software
products are not sufficiently customizable for their enterprises. If the demand
for Prime Response's products does not grow for any of these reasons, its
revenues may be harmed.

 If Prime Response's security system is breached, its business and reputation
 could suffer.

   Prime Response must securely receive and transmit confidential information
over public networks and maintain that information on internal systems. Prime
Response's failure to prevent security breaches could damage its reputation,
expose it to risk of loss or liability, result in a loss of its clients and
adversely affect its ability to obtain new clients. Although Prime Response has
implemented network security measures, its servers are vulnerable to computer
viruses, which could lead to interruptions, delays or loss of data. Prime
Response may be required to expend significant capital and other resources to
license encryption technology and additional technologies to protect against
security breaches or to alleviate problems caused by any breach.

 If e-mails delivered by Prime Response products is limited or blocked, then
 its clients may discontinue the use of Prime Response products thereby
 reducing demand for its products.

   Prime Response's business model relies on its products' ability to deliver
e-mails to recipients over the Internet through Internet service providers,
commonly referred to as ISPs, and to recipients in major

corporations. America Online and other ISPs are able to block unwanted
messages to their users. In addition, certain currently available Internet
browsers allow users to modify their browser settings to return unwanted
e-mails. If these companies or a substantial number of individual users limit
or halt the delivery of e-mails from clients using Prime Response's products,
demand for its products could decrease which would have a material adverse
affect on its business.

 Prime Response's failure to sustain the profitability of its professional
 services organization could adversely affect its financial condition.

   Although Prime Response's professional services organization is currently
operating at a profit, Prime Response cannot be certain that its professional
services organization will sustain profitability. The failure to sustain the
profitability of its professional services organization could have a material
adverse effect on Prime Response's operating results and financial condition.
To gain initial acceptance of its products by clients in Prime Response's
targeted industries, it may elect on occasion, without charge or at a reduced
cost, to assist clients with the implementation of Prime Response products. As
a result, in the past, Prime Response's cost of services revenues had been
significantly higher than its services revenues.

 Loss of key personnel could adversely affect Prime Response's business.

   Prime Response's future success depends to a significant degree on the
skills, experience and efforts of senior executive officers including Allen
Swann, its current Chief Executive Officer and President and Gary Daniels,
Vice President, Product Development. Recently, Peter J. Boni, Prime Response's
former President and Chief Executive Officer, Frederick Phillips, its former
Chief Financial Officer, James Carling, Prime Response's founder and former
Chief Technology Officer and Paul Lavallee, its former President, the Americas
have resigned from Prime Response. The loss of one or more of Prime Response's
executive officers and other members of senior management could have a
material adverse effect on Prime Response. Prime Response also depends on the
ability of its executive officers and other members of senior management to
work effectively as a team. The loss of any additional executive officers and
other members of senior management could have a material adverse effect on
Prime Response. In addition, many of its executive officers, members of senior
management or other employees are not subject to an agreement that prohibits
them from competing with Prime Response after the termination of their
employment with Prime Response. Prime Response does not maintain "key man"
insurance on any of its executive officers or senior management personnel.

 Prime Response may be unable to hire and retain the skilled personnel needed
 to succeed.

   Qualified personnel are in great demand throughout the software industry.
Prime Response's success depends in large part upon its ability to attract,
train, motivate and retain highly skilled employees, particularly sales and
technical personnel and other senior personnel. Prime Response's failure to
attract and retain the highly-trained technical personnel that are integral to
its product development, professional services and support teams may limit the
rate at which Prime Response can develop new products or product enhancements.
This could have a material adverse effect on its business, prospects,
operating results and financial condition.

 Prime Response may be unable to protect its proprietary technology rights.

   Prime Response's success depends to a significant degree upon the
protection of its software and other proprietary technology rights. Prime
Response relies on trade secret, copyright and trademark laws and
confidentiality agreements with employees and third parties, all of which
offer only limited protection. Moreover, the laws of the countries in which it
develops and markets its products may afford little or no effective protection
of its proprietary technology. The reverse engineering, unauthorized copying
or other misappropriation of its proprietary technology could enable third
parties to benefit from its technology without paying Prime Response for it.
This could have material adverse effect on Prime Response. Legal proceedings
to enforce its intellectual property rights could divert the time and
attention of management, be expensive and involve uncertainty of success.

 Claims by other companies that Prime Response's products infringe their
 proprietary rights, copyrights or patents could adversely affect its
 financial condition.

   If any of Prime Response's products are alleged to violate third-party
proprietary rights, it may be required to reengineer its products or seek to
obtain licenses from third parties to continue offering its products without
substantial reengineering. Any efforts to reengineer Prime Response products
or obtain licenses from third parties may be unsuccessful and, in any case,
could substantially increase its costs and have a material adverse effect on
Prime Response. Prime Response does not conduct comprehensive patent searches
to determine whether the technology used in its products infringes patents
held by third parties. In addition, product development is inherently
uncertain in a rapidly evolving technological environment in which there may
be numerous patent applications pending, many of which are confidential when
filed, with regard to similar technologies.

 Claims by other companies that Prime Response's names infringe their
 proprietary rights could adversely affect its financial condition.

   Third parties have claimed, and may in the future claim, that Prime
Response's company name or Prime Response's product names violate their
trademark or trade name rights. Prime Response has applied for registration of
some of Prime Response's trademarks in the United States but some have not yet
received approvals. Prime Response's use of the names Prime Response,
Prime@Vantage and Prime@Vantage.com, as well as the use of other names, may
result in costly litigation, divert management's attention and resources,
cause product shipment delays or require Prime Response to pay damages or to
enter into royalty or license agreements. Prime Response may be required to
stop using certain names currently used for its products. Any of these events
could have a material adverse effect on Prime Response's business, prospects,
operating results and financial condition.

 Prime Response's business could be adversely affected if Prime Response's
 products fail to perform properly.

   Software products as complex as Prime Response's may contain undetected
errors or bugs, which result in product failures or otherwise fail to perform
in accordance with client expectations. Prime Response's products may be
particularly susceptible to bugs or performance degradation because of the
emerging nature of Internet technologies and the stress that may be placed on
its products by the full deployment of its products over the Internet. Product
performance problems could result in loss of or delay in revenues, product
liability claims from clients, loss of market share, failure to achieve market
acceptance, diversion of development resources, or injury to its reputation,
any of which could have a material adverse effect on its business, prospects,
operating results and financial condition. There are some outstanding disputes
between Prime Response and some of its current clients regarding product
performance.

 Prime Response could incur substantial costs as a result of product liability
 claims relating to its clients' marketing efforts.

   Prime Response's products may be critical to its clients' marketing
efforts. If one of Prime Response's products fails, a client may assert a
claim for substantial damages against it, regardless of Prime Response's
responsibilities for such failure. Although Prime Response's form of license
agreement contains provisions limiting liability, including consequential
liability, product liability claims could require Prime Response to spend
significant time and money in litigation or to pay significant damages. There
can be no assurance that Prime Response's product liability, errors and
omissions or general liability insurance will prove sufficient to cover one or
more large claims, or that the insurer will not disclaim coverage as to any
future claim.

 Prime Response's business is subject to government regulation of the Internet
 and other legal uncertainties, which could negatively impact its operations.

   Laws and regulations directly applicable to communications or commerce over
the Internet are becoming more prevalent. The United States Congress recently
enacted Internet laws regarding privacy, copyrights,

taxation and other matters. In addition, the European Union recently enacted
privacy regulations. The laws governing the use of the Internet, however,
remain largely unsettled, even in areas where there has been some legislative
action. It may take years to determine whether and how existing laws such as
those governing intellectual property, privacy, libel and taxation apply to
the Internet. In addition, the growth and development of the market for online
commerce may prompt calls for more stringent consumer protection laws, both in
the United States and abroad, that may impose additional burdens on companies
conducting business online. The adoption or modification of laws or
regulations relating to the Internet could adversely affect Prime Response's
business. In particular, new regulations affecting the use of unsolicited e-
mail advertising would impair Prime Response's clients' marketing efforts and
could reduce the demand for its products.

 Privacy concerns and legislation may limit the information Prime Response's
 clients can gather, which could reduce the demand for its products.

   Privacy concerns may cause Website visitors to resist providing personal
data or avoid Websites that track the Internet behavioral information
necessary to support online profiling capabilities. Even the perception of
security or privacy concerns, whether or not valid, may have a similar effect.
The European Union recently adopted a directive addressing data privacy that
may limit the collection and use of certain information regarding Internet
users. This directive may limit Prime Response's clients' ability to target
advertising or collect and use information in certain European countries. In
addition, legislative or regulatory requirements may heighten these concerns
if businesses must notify Website users that the data captured after visiting
their Websites may be used to direct product promotion and advertising to that
user. Other countries and political entities, such as the European Union, have
adopted these types of restrictions. The United States may adopt similar
legislation or regulatory requirements. If privacy legislation is enacted or
consumer privacy concerns are not adequately addressed, Prime Response's
business, prospects, financial condition and operating results could be
harmed.

   Websites typically use bits of information keyed to a specific server, file
pathway or directory location commonly referred to as "cookies," which are
placed on a customer's hard drive, possibly without the customer's knowledge
or consent, to track demographic information and target advertising. Prime
Response's clients may use cookies for a variety of reasons, including the
collection of data derived from the customer's Internet activity. Most
currently available Internet browsers allow Prime Response clients' customers
to remove cookies at any time or to prevent cookies from being stored on their
hard drives. In addition, some commentators, privacy advocates and
governmental bodies have suggested limiting or eliminating the use of cookies.
Any reduction or limitation of the use of cookies could limit the
effectiveness of Prime Response clients' sales and marketing efforts. The
Federal Trade Commission and several states are investigating the use by
Internet companies of personal information. New regulations regarding the use
of personal information could adversely impact the demand for Prime Response's
products.

 Prime Response's common stock is particularly subject to volatility because
 of Prime Response's industry.

   The stock market in general has recently experienced extreme price and
volume fluctuations. In addition, the market prices of securities of
technology companies, particularly Internet-related companies, have been
extremely volatile, and have experienced fluctuations that have often been
unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of such companies.
These broad market fluctuations has and could continue to adversely affect the
market price of Prime Response's common stock.

   In the past, securities class action litigation has often been brought
against companies following periods of volatility in the market prices of
their securities. Prime Response may be the target of similar litigation in
the future. Securities litigation could result in substantial costs or large
judgments against the company and divert Prime Response's management's
attention and resources, which could cause serious harm to Prime Response's
business, operating results and financial condition.

 The significant control over stockholder voting matters that may be exercised
 by Prime Response's executive officers and directors may deprive stockholders
 of the ability to influence corporate actions.

   Prime Response's current executive officers and directors and their
affiliates together control 14,689,156 shares or approximately 71.7% of the
outstanding common stock as of the record date. As a result, these
stockholders, if they act together, will be able to control all matters
requiring stockholder approval, including the election of directors and
approval of significant corporate transactions like the proposed merger with
Chordiant. This concentration of ownership may have the effect of delaying,
preventing or deterring or approving a change in control of Prime Response,
could deprive Prime Response's stockholders of an opportunity to receive a
premium for their common stock as part of a sale of Prime Response and might
affect the market price of Prime Response's common stock.

                 THE SPECIAL MEETING OF CHORDIANT STOCKHOLDERS

General

   Chordiant is furnishing this joint proxy statement/prospectus to holders of
Chordiant common stock in connection with the solicitation of proxies by the
Chordiant board of directors for use at the special meeting of stockholders of
Chordiant to be held on Tuesday, March 27, 2001, and any adjournment or
postponement thereof.

   This joint proxy statement/prospectus is being mailed to stockholders of
Chordiant on or about February 28, 2001.

Date, Time and Place of the Special Meeting

   The special meeting will be held on Tuesday, March 27, 2001, at 9:00 a.m.,
local time, at the principal offices of Chordiant, 20400 Stevens Creek Blvd.,
Suite 400, Cupertino, CA 95014.

Matters to be Considered at the Special Meeting

   At the Chordiant special meeting, and any adjournment or postponement
thereof, Chordiant stockholders will be asked to consider and vote upon a
proposal to approve the issuance of shares of Chordiant common stock in the
merger and to transact such other business as may properly come before the
special meeting or any adjournments or postponements of the special meeting.

Record Date

   Chordiant's board of directors has fixed the close of business on February
15, 2001, as the record date for determination of Chordiant stockholders
entitled to notice of and to vote at the special meeting.

Voting of Proxies

   Chordiant requests that its stockholders complete, date and sign the proxy
card and promptly return it by mail in the accompanying envelope. Brokers
holding shares in "street name" may vote the shares only if the stockholder
provides instructions on how to vote. Brokers will provide directions on how to
instruct the broker to vote the shares. All properly signed and dated proxies
that Chordiant receives prior to the vote at the special meeting, and that are
not revoked, will be voted in accordance with the instructions indicated on the
proxies or, if no direction is indicated, "FOR" the issuance of shares of
Chordiant common stock in the merger.

   Stockholders may revoke their proxies at any time prior to their use:

  . by delivering to the secretary of Chordiant a signed notice of revocation
    or a later-dated, signed proxy; or

  . by attending the special meeting and voting in person.

   Attendance at the special meeting does not in itself constitute the
revocation of a proxy.

Vote Required

   As of the close of business on February 15, 2001, the record date for the
special meeting, there were 38,096,739 shares of Chordiant common stock
outstanding and entitled to vote, held by approximately 205 holders of record.
The affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the votes cast at the
special meeting is required for approval of the issuance of the shares of
Chordiant common stock in the merger.

   As of the record date for the special meeting, the directors and executive
officers of Chordiant and their affiliates owned approximately 12,952,891
shares of Chordiant common stock, which represented approximately 34% of the
outstanding shares of Chordiant common stock entitled to vote at the special
meeting.

Quorum; Abstentions and Broker Non-Votes

   The required quorum for the transaction of business at the special meeting
is holders, present in person or by proxy, of a majority of the shares of
Chordiant common stock issued and outstanding on the record date. Abstentions
and broker non-votes each will be included in determining the number of shares
present and voting at the meeting for the purpose of determining the presence
of a quorum. Because the approval of the issuance of shares of Chordiant common
stock pursuant to the merger requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the
outstanding shares of Chordiant common stock entitled to vote, abstentions and
broker non-votes will have the same effect as votes against the issuance of
Chordiant shares pursuant to the merger. In addition, the failure of a
Chordiant stockholder to return a proxy or to vote in person will have the
effect of a vote against the proposal to issue shares of Chordiant common stock
pursuant to the merger. Brokers holding shares for beneficial owners cannot
vote on the proposal to issues shares of Chordiant common stock pursuant to the
merger without the owners' specific instructions. Accordingly, Chordiant
stockholders are encouraged to return the enclosed proxy card marked to
indicate their vote.

Solicitation of Proxies and Expenses

   Chordiant has retained the services of Corporate Investor Communications,
Inc. to assist in the solicitation of proxies from Chordiant stockholders. The
fees to be paid to the firm by Chordiant for these services are not expected to
exceed $6,500.00 plus reasonable out-of-pocket expenses. In addition to
solicitation by mail, the directors, officers and employees of Chordiant may
solicit proxies from stockholders by telephone, e-mail, facsimile, in person or
otherwise. Chordiant will bear the costs of solicitation of proxies from its
stockholders, except that Chordiant and Prime Response will each pay one-half
the cost of printing this joint proxy statement/prospectus and the registration
statement of which it is a part.

   Brokerage houses, nominees, fiduciaries and other custodians will be
requested to forward soliciting materials to beneficial owners and will be
reimbursed for their reasonable expenses incurred in sending proxy materials to
beneficial owners.

No Dissenters' or Appraisal Rights

   Chordiant stockholders will not be entitled to exercise dissenters' or
appraisal rights in connection with the merger.

Other Matters

   No other matters may be brought before the special meeting. Under
Chordiant's bylaws, business transacted at the special meeting will be limited
to the purpose stated in the notice accompanying this joint proxy
statement/prospectus. No other purpose has been stated in the notice
accompanying this joint proxy statement/prospectus.

Stockholder Proposals for the Chordiant 2001 Annual Meeting

   Proposals of stockholders of Chordiant that are intended to be presented at
Chordiant's 2001 Annual Meeting must be timely delivered, in writing, to
Chordiant's secretary. Under Chordiant's amended and restated bylaws, in order
to be deemed properly brought before an annual meeting, notice must be
delivered to, or mailed and received at Chordiant's principal executive offices
not later than the close of business on the 60th day nor earlier than the close
of business on the 90th day prior to the first anniversary of the preceding
year's annual meeting; provided however, that in the event that no annual
meeting was held in the previous year or

the date of the annual meeting has changed more than 30 days from the date
contemplated at the time of the previous year's proxy statement, notice by the
stockholder, to be timely must be so received not earlier than the close of
business on the 90th day prior to such annual meeting and not later than the
close of business on the later of the 60th day prior to such annual meeting, or
in the event public announcement of the date of such annual meeting is first
made by the corporation fewer than 70 days prior to the date of such annual
meeting, the close of business on the 10th day following the date on which such
public announcement of the date of such meeting is first made by Chordiant.

   The stockholder's notice must set forth, as to each proposed matter: (1) a
brief description of the business desired to be brought before the meeting; (2)
the name and address, as they appear on Chordiant's books, of the stockholder
proposing such business, (3) the class and number of shares of stock of
Chordiant which are owned beneficially by the stockholder; and (4) any material
interest of the stockholder in such business, and (5) any other information
that is required to be provided by the stockholder pursuant to Regulation 14A
under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. If the chairman of the
meeting determines that such business has not been properly brought before the
meeting, then such business shall not be transacted.

Board Recommendation

   The Chordiant board of directors has concluded that the proposal to approve
the issuance of shares of Chordiant common stock in the merger is advisable and
in the best interests of Chordiant and its stockholders and has approved and
adopted the proposal. Accordingly, the Chordiant board of directors recommends
that all Chordiant stockholders vote "FOR" the issuance of shares of Chordiant
common stock in the merger.

   The matter to be considered at the special meeting is of great importance to
the stockholders of Chordiant. Accordingly, Chordiant stockholders are
encouraged to read and carefully consider the information presented in this
joint proxy statement/prospectus, and to complete, date, sign and promptly
return the enclosed proxy card in the enclosed postage-paid envelope.

any adjournment or postponement thereof.

   This joint proxy statement/prospectus is being mailed to stockholders of
Prime Response on or about February 28, 2001. This joint proxy

Boston, Massachusetts 02109.

Matters to be Considered at the Special Meeting

   At the Prime Response special meeting, and any adjournment or postponement
thereof, Prime Response stockholders will be asked to consider and vote upon a
proposal to adopt the merger agreement, pursuant to which a subsidiary of
Chordiant will merge with and into Prime Response, Prime Response will become a
wholly-owned subsidiary of Chordiant, and each outstanding share of Prime
Response common stock will be converted into the right to receive 0.60 of a
share of Chordiant common stock (with cash for fractional shares).

Record Date

   Prime Response's board of directors has fixed the close of business on
February 15, 2001, as the record date for determination of Prime Response
stockholders entitled to notice of and to vote at the special meeting.

Voting of Proxies

   Prime Response requests that its stockholders complete, date and sign the
proxy card and promptly return it by mail in the accompanying envelope. Brokers
holding shares in "street name" may vote the shares only if the stockholder
provides instructions on how to vote. Brokers will provide directions on how to
instruct the broker to vote the shares. All properly signed and dated proxies
that Prime Response receives prior to the vote at the special meeting, and that
are not revoked, will be voted in accordance with the instructions indicated on
the proxies or, if no direction is indicated, "FOR" the adoption of the merger
agreement.

   Stockholders may revoke their proxies at any time prior to their use:

  . by delivering to the secretary of Prime Response a signed notice of
    revocation or a later-dated, signed proxy; or

  . by attending the special meeting and voting in person.

   Attendance at the special meeting does not in itself constitute the
revocation of a proxy.

Votes Required

   As of the close of business on February 15, 2001, the record date for the
special meeting, there were 20,482,070 shares of Prime Response common stock
outstanding and entitled to vote, held by approximately 79 holders of record.
The holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of Prime Response common
stock

entitled to vote thereon must vote to adopt the merger agreement. Prime
Response stockholders have one vote per share of Prime Response common stock
owned on the record date.

   As of the record date for the special meeting, the current directors and
executive officers of Prime Response and their affiliates owned approximately
14,689,156 shares of Prime Response common stock, which represented
approximately 71.7% of the outstanding shares of Prime Response common stock
entitled to vote at the special meeting. Certain affiliated entities of General
Atlantic Partners, LLC, a principal stockholder of Prime Response whose
representatives also sit on the board of directors of Prime Response, have
entered into voting agreements with Chordiant dated as of January 8, 2001.
These entities have agreed pursuant to the terms of the voting agreements to
vote a significant number of the shares of Prime Response common stock owned by
them as of the record date in favor of the proposal to adopt the merger
agreement. They have also granted Chordiant irrevocable proxies to vote their
shares of Prime Response common stock in favor of the proposal to adopt the
merger agreement. Approximately 8,192,828 shares of Prime Response common
stock, which represents approximately 40% of the outstanding shares of Prime
Response common stock as of the record date, are subject to the voting
agreements. See "Voting Agreements."

Quorum; Abstentions and Broker Non-Votes

   The required quorum for the transaction of business at the special meeting
is holders, present in person or by proxy, of a majority of the shares of Prime
Response common stock issued and outstanding on the record date. Abstentions
and broker non-votes each will be included in determining the number of shares
present and voting at the meeting for the purpose of determining the presence
of a quorum. Because adoption of the merger agreement requires the affirmative
vote of a majority of the outstanding shares of Prime Response common stock
entitled to vote, abstentions and broker non-votes will have the same effect as
votes against the adoption of the merger agreement. In addition, the failure of
a Prime Response stockholder to return a proxy or to vote in person will have
the effect of a vote against the adoption of the merger agreement. Brokers
holding shares for beneficial owners cannot vote on the proposal to adopt the
merger agreement without the owners' specific instructions. Accordingly, Prime
Response stockholders are encouraged to return the enclosed proxy card marked
to indicate their vote.

Solicitation of Proxies and Expenses

   The directors, officers and employees of Prime Response may solicit proxies
from stockholders by telephone, e-mail, facsimile, mail or in person. Brokerage
houses, nominees, fiduciaries and other custodians will be requested to forward
soliciting materials to beneficial owners and will be reimbursed for their
reasonable expenses incurred in sending proxy materials to beneficial owners.
Prime Response will bear its own expenses in connection with the solicitation
of proxies for its special meeting of stockholders, except that Chordiant and
Prime Response each will pay one-half of all printing and filing costs and
expenses incurred in connection with this joint proxy statement/prospectus and
the registration statement of which it is a part.

No Dissenters' or Appraisal Rights

   Prime Response stockholders will not be entitled to dissenters' or appraisal
rights in connection with the merger.

Other Matters

   No other matters may be brought before the special meeting. Under Prime
Response's bylaws, business transacted at the special meeting will be limited
to the purpose stated in the notice accompanying this joint proxy
statement/prospectus. No other purpose has been stated in the notice
accompanying this joint proxy statement/prospectus.

Stockholder Proposals for the Prime Response 2001 Annual Meeting

   If the merger is not completed, proposals of stockholders of Prime Response
that are intended to be presented at Prime Response's 2001 Annual Meeting must
be timely delivered to or received by Prime Response's secretary. Under Prime
Response's amended and restated bylaws, in order to be deemed properly
presented, notice must be delivered to, or mailed and received at Prime
Response's principal executive offices not less than 60 days nor more than 90
days prior to the meeting; provided however, that in the event that 70 days
notice or prior public disclosure of the date of the meeting is given or made
to stockholders, notice by the stockholder, to be timely, must be so received
not later than the close of business on the 10th day following the date on
which such notice of the date of the meeting was mailed, or such public
disclosure was made, whichever occurs first.

   The stockholder's notice must set forth, as to each proposed matter: (1) a
brief description of the business desired to be brought before the meeting and
the reasons for conducting such business at the annual meeting; (2) the name
and address, as they appear on Prime Response's books, of the stockholder
proposing such business, (3) the class and number of shares of stock of Prime
Response which are owned beneficially by the stockholder; and (4) any material
interest of the stockholder in such business. If the chairman of the meeting
determines that such business has not been properly brought before the meeting,
then such business shall not be transacted.

Board Recommendation

   The Prime Response board of directors has determined that the merger
agreement and the merger are advisable and fair to and in the best interests of
Prime Response and its stockholders. Accordingly, the Prime Response board of
directors has approved the merger agreement and the merger and recommends that
stockholders vote "FOR" adoption of the merger agreement.

   The matter to be considered at the special meeting is of great importance to
the stockholders of Prime Response. Accordingly, Prime Response stockholders
are encouraged to read and carefully consider the information presented in this
joint proxy statement/prospectus, and to complete, date, sign and promptly
return the enclosed proxy card in the enclosed postage-paid envelope.

   Prime Response stockholders should not send any stock certificates with
their proxy cards. A transmittal form with instructions for the surrender of
Prime Response common stock certificates will be mailed to Prime Response
stockholders promptly after completion of the merger. For more information
regarding the procedures for exchanging Prime Response stock certificates for
Chordiant stock certificates, see "Certain Terms of the Merger Agreement--
Manner and Basis of Converting Shares."

                                   THE MERGER

General

   This section of this joint proxy statement/prospectus describes aspects of
the proposed merger that are considered to be important. The discussion of the
merger in this joint proxy statement/prospectus and the description of the
principal terms of the merger agreement are only summaries of the material
features of the proposed merger. You can obtain a more complete understanding
of the merger by reading the merger agreement, a copy of which is attached to
this joint proxy statement/prospectus as Annex A. You are encouraged to read
the merger agreement and the other annexes to this joint proxy
statement/prospectus in their entirety.

General Description of the Merger

   At the effective time of the merger, Puccini Acquisition Corp., a wholly-
owned subsidiary of Chordiant, will be merged with and into Prime Response.
Prime Response will be the surviving corporation and will continue as a wholly-
owned subsidiary of Chordiant. In the merger, each share of Prime Response
common stock outstanding at the effective time of the merger will automatically
be converted into 0.60 of a share of Chordiant common stock (and cash in lieu
of any fractional share).

   Based on the number of shares of Chordiant common stock and Prime Response
common stock outstanding as of the record date, approximately 12,289,242 shares
of Chordiant common stock will be issuable pursuant to the merger agreement in
exchange for outstanding shares of Prime Response common stock, representing
approximately 24% of the total Chordiant common stock to be outstanding after
such issuance. This assumes that no Prime Response or Chordiant stock options
or warrants are exercised after the record date and before the effective time
of the merger.

Background of the Merger

   The terms and conditions of the merger agreement and merger are the result
of arm's length negotiations between representatives of Chordiant and
representatives of Prime Response. Set forth below is a summary of the
background of these negotiations.

   Chordiant and Prime Response have been familiar with each other's businesses
for a number of years. Senior executives of the two companies have previously
encountered one another in a variety of business and industry settings.

   Throughout the summer and early fall of 2000, Prime Response engaged in
discussions with a number of companies concerning potential business
combinations or other partnering transactions.

   On May 23, 2000, Peter Boni, Prime Response's President and Chief Executive
Officer, met with a representative of Thomas Weisel Partners, to explore
strategic partnership options, including a possible marketing partnership with
some of Thomas Weisel Partners' clients.

   On June 21, 2000, Samuel Spadafora, Chordiant's Chief Executive Officer and
Chairman of the Chordiant board of directors called Mr. Boni to explore
strategic partnership options, including a possible marketing partnership.

   During July 2000, Thomas Weisel Partners discussed with Chordiant various
topics related to a possible transaction with Prime Response. The engagement of
Thomas Weisel Partners was confirmed in writing by an engagement letter dated
October 24, 2000. On July 12, 2000, Thomas Weisel Partners gave Mr. Spadafora,
Steven Springsteel, Chordiant's then current Chief Financial Officer, Don
Morrison, Executive Vice President, Business Development and Marketing, David
Bernstein, Vice President of Strategic Business Development and

Joseph Tumminaro, Chief Technology Officer of Chordiant, a briefing on Prime
Response's financial and product background.

   On July 13, 2000, Mr. Boni and James Carling, Chief Technology Officer of
Prime Response, and Frederick Phillips, Chief Financial Officer of Prime
Response, met with Mr. Spadafora, Mr. Springsteel, Mr. Morrison, Mr. Bernstein
and Mr. Tumminaro at Chordiant's offices to exchange information about their
respective companies. Prior to this meeting and on the same day, Chordiant and
Prime Response executed a mutual confidentiality agreement containing customary
terms and conditions regarding the confidential treatment of information
furnished by either party. During this meeting, both parties agreed to begin a
marketing and co-selling strategic partnership, and both parties expressed an
interest in exploring the possibility of a merger transaction involving
Chordiant and Prime Response.

   On July 21, 2000, senior management of Chordiant met with the board of
directors of Chordiant to, among other things, outline Chordiant's merger and
acquisition strategy and strategic partnering strategy. The board of directors
of Chordiant authorized senior management of Chordiant to continue to
investigate potential strategic partners and acquisition candidates.

   On July 24, 2000, Mr. Boni and Mr. Phillips met with the board of directors
of Prime Response, to, among other things, outline different acquisitions
proposals which had been presented to Prime Response and to analyze the
strengths and weaknesses of each proposal.

   On August 10, 2000, Mr. Bernstein and representatives of Thomas Weisel
Partners met with Mr. Boni, Mr. Phillips and representatives of Robertson
Stephens, the exclusive financial advisor to Prime Response engaged by Prime
Response pursuant to an engagement letter between Prime Response and Robertson
Stephens dated October 4, 1999. During this meeting, Mr. Boni, Mr. Phillips and
representatives of Robertson Stephens gave Mr. Bernstein and representatives of
Thomas Weisel Partners a due diligence overview of Prime Response's business in
connection with investigating the possibility of a merger transaction between
Chordiant and Prime Response. At various times during the meeting, Gary
Daniels, Vice President of Product Development for Prime Response, and Allen
Swann, President, International for Prime Response, were teleconferenced in
from their United Kingdom offices to answer certain questions.

   On August 15, 2000, Mr. Bernstein met with Ian Bowles, Senior Vice
President, International, Andrew Cutler, Vice President of Application
Consulting and Product Marketing and Tony O'Donnell, Vice President of
Alliances, International of Prime Response, in the United Kingdom to review the
possibility of integrating Prime Response's product line with Chordiant's
current products and the possible business synergies between the two companies.

   On September 18, 2000, Mr. Spadafora, Mr. Springsteel, Mr. Morrison and Mr.
Bernstein met with Marc McMorris, a director of Prime Response and a principal
of General Atlantic Partners, LLC ("GAP"), a principal stockholder of Prime
Response, in Chicago. At this meeting, Chordiant made an oral non-binding
proposal to Prime Response regarding a possible stock-for-stock merger
transaction involving Chordiant and Prime Response. This proposal included,
among other terms, a proposed exchange ratio of 0.60 of a share of Chordiant
stock for each share of Prime Response common stock. The closing price of
Chordiant's common stock on September 18, 2000 was $10.50 and the closing price
of Prime Response's common stock on that date was $4.50. At this exchange
ratio, the implied price of Prime Response stock price on September 18, 2000
was $6.30 (determined by multiplying $10.50 by 0.60) and the implied equity
value of Prime Response was approximately $137.5 million.

   On September 20, 2000 a term sheet outlining Chordiant's proposal was
exchanged between the two parties and negotiation of the term sheet occurred
between September 20, 2000 and October 3, 2000. During that time, Chordiant and
Prime Response were unable to come to an agreement on the terms of the proposed
transaction between Chordiant and Prime Response. On October 5, 2000, Mr. Boni
called Mr. Bernstein to indicate that continued discussions between the two
companies would not be productive at that time.

   Throughout the week of October 11, 2000, Mr. Bernstein spoke with Mr. Boni
by telephone to discuss the possibility of pursing a strategic partnership. On
October 17, 2000, Chordiant and Prime Response agreed that they would pursue a
marketing partnership and also decided to resume discussions with respect to a
proposed merger transaction between the two companies. On October 18, 2000, a
revised term sheet, including a possible exchange ratio of 0.65 of a share of
Chordiant common stock for each share of Prime Response common stock, was sent
to Mr. Boni. The closing price of Chordiant's common stock on October 18, 2000
was $6.38 and the closing price of Prime Response's common stock on that date
was $2.94. At this exchange ratio, the implied price of Prime Response common
stock on October 18, 2000 was $4.15 (determined by multiplying $6.38 by 0.65)
and the implied equity value of Prime Response on October 18, 2000 was
approximately $86.2 million.

   On October 20, 2000, Mr. Spadafora made a presentation to the Chordiant
board of directors regarding the status of the current negotiations between
Chordiant and Prime Response. After discussion, the board of directors
authorized senior management of Chordiant to continue discussions and
negotiations with Prime Response regarding the proposed merger.

   On October 25, 2000, Mr. Morrison and Mr. Bernstein met with Mr. McMorris
and Mr. Boni. From October 25, 2000 until October 27, 2000, revised term sheets
outlining terms surrounding a possible merger transaction between Chordiant and
Prime Response were exchanged. On October 26, 2000, a revised term sheet,
including a possible exchange ratio of 0.70 of a share of Chordiant common
stock for each share of Prime Response common stock, was sent to Mr. Boni. The
closing price of Chordiant's common stock on October 26, 2000 was $7.38 and the
closing price of Prime Response's common stock on that date was $2.94. At this
exchange ratio, the implied price of Prime Response common stock on October 26,
2000 was $5.17 (determined by multiplying $7.38 by 0.70) and the implied equity
value of Prime Response on October 26, 2000 was approximately $109.8 million.

   Between October 30, 2000 and November 1, 2000, Mr. Boni informed various
executive officers of Chordiant that Prime Response was considering other
acquisition proposals from third parties.

   On November 1, 2000, Mr. Boni made a presentation to the Prime Response
board of directors regarding the status of the current negotiations between
Chordiant and Prime Response and other potential strategic alternatives.

   On November 2, 2000, Mr. Boni called Mr. Bernstein to inform him that Prime
Response had chosen to enter into a merger transaction with another corporation
and that the proposed merger transaction between Prime Response and Chordiant
would no longer be feasible. A merger agreement between Prime Response and the
other corporation was never executed.

   On November 15, 2000, Mr. McMorris called Mr. Spadafora, and Mr. Boni called
Mr. Bernstein to inquire about resuming discussions with Chordiant regarding a
merger transaction between the companies.

   Between November 16 and November 17, 2000, representatives of the two
companies decided that, subject to a number of significant contingencies,
including approval by both companies' board of directors and stockholders,
receipt of fairness opinions from their respective investment bankers, as well
as completion of due diligence, and agreement on various open issues, the two
companies would proceed towards negotiation and execution of a merger
agreement.

   On November 17, 2000, Mr. McMorris made a presentation to the Prime Response
board of directors regarding the status of the current negotiations between
Chordiant and Prime Response. After discussion, the board of directors
authorized senior management of Prime Response to continue discussions and
negotiations with Chordiant and to enter into a non-binding term sheet. On the
same day, Chordiant delivered to Prime Response a non-binding term sheet
containing an outline of the principal terms of a possible transaction and both
parties executed a letter agreement, which included "no shop" provisions
prohibiting Prime Response from soliciting or entertaining acquisition
proposals from third parties for a limited period of time. Based on

changes in circumstances since the parties' discussions in September and
October, the representatives of the companies discussed key elements of the
proposed transaction, including a possible exchange ratio of 0.70 of a share of
Chordiant common stock for each share of Prime Response common stock. The
closing price of Chordiant's common stock on November 17, 2000 was $4.38 and
the closing price of Prime Response's common stock on that date was $3.06. At
this exchange ratio, the implied price of Prime Response common stock on
November 17, 2000 was $3.07 (determined by multiplying $4.38 by 0.70) and the
implied equity value of Prime Response on November 17, 2000 was approximately
$62.8 million.

   On November 22, 2000, outside legal counsel to Chordiant delivered a first
draft of a merger agreement to outside legal counsel to Prime Response. On the
same day, due diligence request lists were exchanged between the two parties.
Representatives of both companies and their respective outside legal counsel
and financial advisors exchanged various telephone calls with a view toward
preparing for due diligence efforts. The due diligence investigations continued
through December 17, 2000. Due diligence efforts were suspended on December 18,
2000, resumed on January 3, 2001 and continued until the merger agreement was
executed on January 8, 2001.

   During the period from November 22, 2000 to December 17, 2000, Prime
Response's management team and legal, financial and accounting advisors met by
telephonic conference call to review and summarize the progress of their due
diligence and the negotiation of the merger.

   On November 28, 2000, representatives from both Prime Response and Chordiant
met in Boston to discuss the proposed merger involving the two companies.

   On November 29, 2000, a due diligence meeting was held in Boston.
Representatives of Prime Response made presentations about the company's
business model and sales outlook and answered questions during the meeting. The
attendees included: Mr. Spadafora, Mr. Morrison, Mr. Bernstein, Stephen Kelly,
President and Chief Operating Officer of Chordiant, Mr. Boni, Mr. Phillips,
Terence Osborne, Chairman of the board of directors of Prime Response, Mark
Abbott, Vice President of Product Planning for Prime Response, Mr. Carling,

Counsel of Prime Response, Steven Gal, Vice President of Marketing of Prime
Response, James Plantan, Vice President of Business Development of Prime
Response, Mr. McMorris and Rajeev Shah, an associate for GAP. Representatives
from Thomas Weisel Partners and Robertson Stephens also took part in this due
diligence meeting.

   On December 5, 2000, Mr. Kelly, Mr. Morrison and Cary Morgan, Acting Chief
Financial Officer, Acting Chief Accounting Officer, Acting Secretary, Vice
President and Controller of Chordiant held a due diligence conference call
whereby they provided certain members of senior management of Prime Response
and certain members of the board of directors of Prime Response, including Mr.
Boni, Mr. Phillips and Mr. McMorris, sales outlook and other sales information
about Chordiant and answered questions about such information. Representatives
from Thomas Weisel Partners and Robertson Stephens also took part in this due
diligence conference call.

   On December 6, 2000, Mr. Spadafora, Mr. Morrison, Mr. Morgan and Mr.
Bernstein held a further due diligence conference call whereby they provided
certain members of senior management of Prime Response and certain members or
representatives of the board of directors of Prime Response, including Mr.
Boni, Mr. Phillips, Mr. McMorris, Franchon M. Smithson, a partner for GAP and
Mr. Shah, financial, customer, marketing and product information about
Chordiant and answered questions about Chordiant's business. Representatives
from Thomas Weisel Partners and Robertson Stephens also took part in this due
diligence conference call.

   During the period from December 7, 2000 until December 17, 2000,
representatives of Chordiant and representatives of Prime Response and the
respective outside legal counsels and financial advisors to Chordiant and Prime
Response had numerous meetings and telephone conferences during which the
merger agreement and various related agreements were discussed and negotiated.

   On December 15, 2000, Mr. Boni provided Mr. Spadafora, Mr. Morgan and Mr.
Morrison with an update on Prime Response's business and the outlook for the
fourth quarter of 2000.

   On December 15, 2000, the Prime Response board of directors met by
telephonic conference call to review the terms of the merger agreement. After
reviewing the terms of the agreement and discussing the benefits and risks of
the merger and the board's fiduciary duties with its legal and financial
advisors, the Prime Response board of directors approved the merger agreement.

   On December 16, 2000, the Chordiant board of directors held a conference
call with members of Chordiant's senior management, members of Chordiant's
outside legal counsel and representatives of Thomas Weisel Partners to discuss
the proposed terms of the merger agreement, results of due diligence and the
strategic opportunities presented by the proposed merger. Thomas Weisel
Partners presented a detailed financial analysis of the proposed merger.
Representatives of Cooley Godward LLP discussed the key legal issues presented
by the proposed merger agreement and related agreements and also made a
presentation to the Chordiant board of directors regarding the results of due
diligence. The members of the Chordiant board of directors present at the
meeting inquired as to the results of the due diligence efforts and the
potential benefits and risks to Chordiant of the proposed merger. At the
conclusion of the financial review and discussion of the terms of the merger
agreement, Thomas Weisel Partners provided the Chordiant board of directors
with financial advice regarding the proposed merger. The board of directors
identified certain terms and conditions that should be included in the
definitive merger agreement and authorized senior management of Chordiant to
continue negotiations with Prime Response, subject to meeting the identified
terms and conditions.

   On December 16, 2000, Mr. Spadafora called Mr. Boni to discuss certain
proposed terms and conditions to the proposed merger. Despite negotiating these
terms and conditions throughout the day, the parties were unable to come to an
agreement.

   Certain members of the Chordiant board of directors held another conference
call on December 17, 2000 with senior management of Chordiant and Chordiant's
outside legal counsel to discuss the status of the proposed merger, including
certain terms and conditions of the merger agreement. After discussion, the
Chordiant board of directors approved the merger agreement, the related
agreements, including the voting agreements, and the transactions contemplated
by the merger agreement and the related agreements, subject to certain terms
and conditions being included in the definitive merger agreement and the
successful completion of negotiations. On the same day, Mr. Spadafora, various
other members of Chordiant's senior management and Chordiant's outside legal
counsel once again discussed and negotiated the proposed terms of the merger
agreement with representatives of Prime Response and Prime Response's outside
legal counsel. The parties were unable to come to an agreement on the proposed
terms of the merger agreement.

   On December 18, 2000, both Chordiant and Prime Response decided to cease
discussions related to a proposed merger at this time.

   During the week of December 18, 2000, Mr. William Ford, a general partner of
GAP and Mr. Spadafora had a number of phone discussions to discuss the
possibility of resuming negotiations between the parties.

   On December 26, 2000, Mr. Spadafora and Mr. Morrison held a conference call
with Mr. Ford and Mr. McMorris to discuss possible deal terms.

   Between December 26, 2000 and December 29, 2000, Mr. Morrison and Mr.
McMorris discussed the various terms and conditions of the merger agreement in
an attempt to come to a mutual agreement.

   On December 28, 2000, Prime Response's outside legal counsel forwarded
senior management of Chordiant and Chordiant's outside legal counsel a proposal
with respect to certain conditions of closing in the merger agreement.

   During the period from January 3, 2001 until January 8, 2001,
representatives of Chordiant and of Prime Response and their respective outside
legal counsel had numerous telephone conferences during which the proposed
merger, merger agreement and various related agreements were again discussed
and negotiated.

   On January 4, 2001, the Chordiant board of directors met again by telephone
conference to discuss the proposed merger. Thomas Weisel Partners updated its
financial review with respect to the proposed merger. The Chordiant board of
directors, members of Chordiant management and representatives of Chordiant's
outside legal counsel and Thomas Weisel Partners discussed the terms of the
merger agreement, including, based on changes in circumstances since December,
a possible exchange ratio of 0.60 of a share of Chordiant common stock for each
share of Prime Response common stock. The closing price of Chordiant's common
stock on January 4, 2001 was $3.47 and the closing price of Prime Response's
common stock on January 4, 2001 was $1.03. At this exchange ratio, the implied
price of Prime Response common stock on January 4, 2001 was $2.08 (determined
by multiplying $3.47 by 0.60) and the implied equity value of Prime Response on
January 4, 2001 was approximately $42.6 million. At the conclusion of the
financial review and discussion of the terms of the merger agreement, Thomas
Weisel Partners provided the Chordiant board of directors with an oral opinion
(subsequently confirmed in writing) that, as of that date and based upon
certain assumptions and qualifications, the exchange ratio in the merger
agreement (0.60 of a share of Chordiant common stock for each share of Prime
Response common stock) was fair to Chordiant from a financial point of view.
After discussion, the Chordiant board of directors approved the merger
agreement, the related agreements, including the voting agreements, and the
transactions contemplated by the merger agreement and the related agreements,
subject to successful completion of negotiations, and authorized the officers
of Chordiant to finalize and execute the merger agreement and related
agreements.

   On January 5, 2001, the Prime Response board of directors met again to
discuss the proposed merger. At the meeting, Robertson Stephens updated its
financial review with respect to the proposed merger. The board of directors,
members of Prime Response's management and representatives of Prime Response's
outside legal counsel and Robertson Stephens discussed the terms of the merger
agreement and related agreements. At the conclusion of the financial review and
discussion of the terms of the merger agreement and related agreements,
Robertson Stephens provided the Prime Response board of directors with an oral
opinion (subsequently confirmed in writing) that, based upon certain
assumptions and qualifications, the exchange ratio pursuant to the merger
agreement was fair to the holders of Prime Response common stock from a
financial point of view. After full discussion, the Prime Response board of
directors approved the merger agreement, the related agreements and the
transactions contemplated by the merger agreement and the related agreements
and authorized the officers of Prime Response to finalize and execute the
merger agreement and related agreements.

   On January 8, 2001, upon completion of all negotiations and finalization of
all agreements, the parties executed and delivered the merger agreement and
certain of the related agreements, and at the close of market on January 8,
2001, Chordiant and Prime Response issued a joint press release announcing the
transaction.

Reasons for the Merger

   The following discussion of the parties' reasons for the merger contains a
number of forward-looking statements that reflect the current views of
Chordiant or Prime Response with respect to future events that may have an
effect on their future financial performance. Forward-looking statements are
subject to risks and uncertainties. Actual results and outcomes may differ
materially from the results and outcomes discussed in the forward-looking
statements. Cautionary statements that identify important factors that could
cause or contribute to differences in results and outcomes include those
discussed in "Summary--Forward-Looking Information" and "Risk Factors."

 Chordiant's Reasons for the Merger and Recommendation of the Chordiant Board
 of Directors

   Chordiant's board of directors determined that the terms of the merger and
the merger agreement are fair to, and in the best interests of, Chordiant and
its stockholders. Chordiant's board of directors consulted with

Chordiant's senior management, as well as its legal counsel and financial
advisors in reaching its decision to approve the merger and the merger
agreement. Chordiant's primary reasons for seeking to complete the merger with
Prime Response are the beliefs of the board of directors and management of
Chordiant that the merger could result in a number of benefits, including the
following:

  . entry into new strategic market segments for Chordiant, with the
    potential for growth through an established market leader;

  . the ability of the combined company to offer existing and potential
    customers complementary and expanded product lines;

  . Prime Response's marketing software applications, technologies and
    technical, engineering and sales expertise, which are in high demand and
    in short supply; and

  . the ability of the two companies to combine their technological resources
    to develop new and improved products and additional applications.

   In reaching its determination that the merger is in the best interests of
Chordiant and its stockholders, the board of directors of Chordiant considered
a number of factors, including the factors discussed above and listed below.
The conclusions reached by the board of directors of Chordiant with respect to
these factors supported its determination that the merger and the issuance of
shares of Chordiant common stock in the merger were fair to, and in the best
interests of, Chordiant:

  . the judgment, advice and analyses of Chordiant's management with respect
    to the potential strategic, financial and operational benefits of the
    merger, including Chordiant management's favorable recommendation of the
    merger, based in part on the business, technical, financial and
    accounting due diligence investigations performed with respect to Prime
    Response;

  . the terms of the merger agreement and related agreements, including price
    and structure, which were considered by both the board of directors and
    management of Chordiant to provide a fair and equitable basis for the
    merger;

  . the complementary fit between Chordiant's and Prime Response's market
    segments, which should facilitate integration of the two companies; and

  . the opinion of Thomas Weisel Partners that, based on and subject to
    matters set forth in its opinion, the exchange ratio pursuant to the
    merger agreement was fair from a financial point of view to Chordiant.

   The board of directors of Chordiant also considered a number of potentially
negative factors in its deliberations concerning the merger. The potentially
negative factors considered by the board of directors of Chordiant included:

  . the risk that the merger might not be completed in a timely manner or at
    all;

  . the potential negative impact of any customer or partner confusion after
    announcement of the proposed merger;

  . the potential negative reaction of the financial community after
    announcement of the proposed merger;

  . the potential dilutive effect on Chordiant's common stock price if
    revenue and earnings expectations of the combined company are not met;

  . the fact that Prime Response had not met securities analysts'
    expectations with respect to earnings and revenues in 2000 and may not
    meet such expectations in 2001;

  . risks related to the future operation of Prime Response's business,
    including potential adverse effects arising from circumstances that
    existed prior to the signing of the merger agreement;

  . the fact that Chordiant would have to consummate the merger even if
    during the pre-closing period, a change, effect, event, occurrence, state
    of facts or development occurs that has had or could reasonably be
    expected to have a material adverse effect on the business, financial
    condition or results of operations of Prime Response and its
    subsidiaries;

  . the risk that the potential benefits of the merger may not be realized,
    including Chordiant's inability to retain the key technical and
    engineering employees of Prime Response;

  . the general difficulties of integrating products, employees, technologies
    and companies;

  . the costs associated with the merger, including merger related
    transaction costs and costs associated with severance arrangements with
    certain employees; and

  . the other risks and uncertainties discussed above under "Risk Factors."

   The foregoing discussion of information and factors considered by the
Chordiant board of directors is not intended to be exhaustive but is believed
to include all material factors considered by the board. In view of the wide
variety of factors considered by the Chordiant board of directors, the
Chordiant board of directors did not find it practicable to quantify or
otherwise assign relative weights to the specific factors considered. In
addition, the board of directors did not reach any specific conclusion on each
factor considered, or any aspect of any particular factor, but conducted an
overall analysis of these factors. Individual members of the Chordiant board of
directors may have given different weights to different factors. After taking
into account all of the factors set forth above, however, the Chordiant board
of directors agreed that the merger agreement and the merger were fair to, and
in the best interests of, Chordiant and its stockholders and that Chordiant
should proceed with the merger.

   There can be no assurance that the benefits of the potential growth,
synergies or opportunities considered by the Chordiant board of directors will
be achieved through consummation of the merger. See "Risk Factors."

   FOR THE REASONS DISCUSSED ABOVE, CHORDIANT'S BOARD OF DIRECTORS HAS APPROVED
THE ISSUANCE OF SHARES OF CHORDIANT COMMON STOCK IN THE MERGER AND RECOMMENDS
THAT CHORDIANT'S STOCKHOLDERS VOTE "FOR" THE ISSUANCE OF SHARES OF CHORDIANT
COMMON STOCK IN THE MERGER.

 Prime Response's Reasons for the Merger and Recommendation of the Prime
 Response Board of Directors

   Prime Response's board of directors has determined that the terms of the
merger and the merger agreement are fair to and in the best interests of Prime
Response and its stockholders, and determined to recommend that the
stockholders of Prime Response adopt the merger agreement. In its evaluation of
the merger and the merger agreement, Prime Response's board of directors
consulted with Prime Response's senior management, as well as its legal and
financial advisors. The decision of the Prime Response board of directors to
approve the merger and the merger agreement was based upon the potential
benefits derived from the possible merger of Prime Response and Chordiant as
compared to Prime Response continuing to operate as an independent business.
Prime Response's management has also considered a number of alternatives for
enhancing its business, including merging with other companies or modifying
various aspects of its current operations and proceeding as an independent
business. In addition to the potential benefits described under "The Merger--
Chordiant's Reasons for the Merger and Recommendation of the Chordiant Board of
Directors" that would be applicable to Prime Response stockholders, the Prime
Response board believes there are additional reasons that the merger will be
beneficial to Prime Response and its stockholders including the following:

  . the merger would provide Prime Response stockholders with shares of
    Chordiant common stock in a tax-free exchange for United States federal
    income tax purposes at a small implied premium over the market price for
    Prime Response common stock at the time the merger agreement was entered
    into;

  . the availability following the merger of greater resources to continue to
    establish and support sales of both companies' products;

  . the ability to make greater resources available for the distribution of
    Prime Response's products and services;

  . enabling the combined company to offer complementary product lines, which
    presents the opportunity to increase the breadth of products and services
    offered;

  . the enhanced ability of the combined company to offer product offerings
    with more comprehensive features and functionality, in order to be better
    positioned as the competitive market evolves and competitive products are
    introduced; and

  . the ability of the combined enterprise to better attract experienced and
    required personnel, particularly in sales and marketing, in light of the
    combined enterprise's greater available resources and geographic
    presence.

   Prime Response's board reviewed a number of factors in evaluating the
merger, including, but not limited to, the following:

  . information concerning the financial performance and condition, results
    of operations, competitive position, management and business of Chordiant
    and Prime Response before and after giving effect to the merger;

  . current financial market conditions and historical market prices,
    volatility and trading information with respect to Chordiant common stock
    and Prime Response common stock;

  . the consideration Chordiant will issue in the merger in light of offers
    from other acquirors;

  . the belief that the terms of the merger agreement and related agreements
    are reasonable;

  . the impact of the merger on the customers, partners and employees of
    Prime Response and Chordiant;

  . the market conditions affecting Prime Response;

  . the ability of Prime Response to continue to grow and prosper as a stand-
    alone entity;

  . results of the due diligence investigation conducted by Prime Response's
    management, accountants and legal and financial advisors; and

  . the financial presentation of Robertson Stephens and its opinion as to
    the fairness to the stockholders of Prime Response from a financial point
    of view, as of the date of its opinion, of the exchange ratio provided
    for in the merger agreement, as more fully described below under the
    caption "The Merger--Opinion of Prime Response's Financial Advisor."

   Prime Response's board also considered the terms of the merger agreement
regarding Prime Response's rights and limits on its ability to consider and
negotiate other acquisition proposals, as well as the possible effects of the
provisions regarding termination, termination fees and the reimbursement of
Chordiant's merger-related expenses. In addition, it was noted to Prime
Response's board that the merger is expected to be a tax-free transaction for
United States federal income tax purposes and accounted for as a purchase.

   The Prime Response board also identified and considered a number of
potentially negative factors in its deliberations concerning the merger and the
merger agreement, including the following:

  . the risk that the potential benefits of the merger may not be realized;

  . the fact that the proposed exchange ratio is fixed and will not change
    with increases or decreases in the market price of either company's stock
    before completion of the merger, and the possibility that the dollar
    value of a share of Chordiant stock at the closing of the merger may be
    more or less than the dollar value of a share of Chordiant stock at the
    time of the signing of the merger agreement;

  . the risk that the merger may not be consummated, notwithstanding the
    voting agreements obtained from holders representing beneficial
    ownership, excluding any shares issuable upon the exercise of options or
    warrants, of approximately 40% of Prime Response's outstanding common
    stock as of the record date, and the effect of the public announcement of
    the merger on Prime Response's sales, customer relations and operating
    results;

  . the risk of management and employee disruption associated with the
    merger, including employee layoffs and the fact that key technical, sales
    and management personnel would likely not be employed by Chordiant
    following the merger;

  . the merger would provide Prime Response stockholders with shares of
    Chordiant common stock in a tax-free exchange for United States federal
    income tax purposes with very little implied premium over the market
    price for Prime Response common stock at the time the merger agreement
    was entered into;

  . the fact that the merger agreement requires Prime Response to obtain
    Chordiant's consent in order to take a variety of actions;

  . Prime Response's limited ability to terminate the merger agreement,
    including the fact that, under certain circumstances, the receipt of a
    superior proposal may allow the Prime Response board of directors to
    change or withdraw its recommendation as to the adoption of the merger
    agreement, but would still require Prime Response to submit the adoption
    of the merger agreement to a vote of Prime Response stockholders;

  . the fact that Prime Response would have to consummate the merger even if
    during the pre-closing period, a change, effect, event, occurrence, state
    of facts or development occurs that has had or could reasonably be
    expected to have a material adverse effect on the business, financial
    condition or results of operations of Chordiant and its subsidiaries;

  . the challenges of integrating Prime Response's operations with those of
    Chordiant; and

  . other applicable risks described in this joint proxy statement/prospectus
    under "Risk Factors."

   Prime Response's board concluded, however, that these risks could be managed
or mitigated and that on balance, the merger's potential benefits to Prime
Response and its stockholders outweighed the associated risks. This discussion
of the information and factors considered by Prime Response's board is not
exhaustive. In view of the variety of factors considered in connection with its
evaluation of the merger, Prime Response's board did not find it practicable
to, and did not quantify or otherwise assign relative weight to, the specific
factors considered in reaching the determination.

   FOR THE REASONS DISCUSSED ABOVE, PRIME RESPONSE'S BOARD OF DIRECTORS HAS
APPROVED AND ADOPTED THE MERGER AGREEMENT AND THE MERGER AND HAS DETERMINED
THAT THE MERGER AGREEMENT AND THE MERGER ARE ADVISABLE AND FAIR TO AND IN THE
BEST INTERESTS OF PRIME RESPONSE AND ITS STOCKHOLDERS, AND RECOMMENDS THAT
PRIME RESPONSE STOCKHOLDERS VOTE "FOR" THE ADOPTION OF THE MERGER AGREEMENT.

   In considering the recommendation of Prime Response's board with respect to
the merger agreement, Prime Response stockholders should be aware that certain
directors and officers of Prime Response have interests in the merger that are
different from, or are in addition to, the interests of other Prime Response
stockholders and that Chordiant has agreed to continue certain existing
indemnification arrangements in favor of directors and officers of Prime
Response. Please see "The Merger--Interests of Prime Response's Officers and
Directors in the Merger."

Opinion of Chordiant's Financial Advisor

   The board of directors of Chordiant engaged Thomas Weisel Partners to act as
its financial advisor and to render a fairness opinion in connection with the
proposed merger of Prime Response and Chordiant. On

January 4, 2001, Thomas Weisel Partners delivered to the Chordiant board of
directors its oral opinion (which was subsequently confirmed in writing) that,
as of that date and based upon the assumptions made, matters considered and
limits of review set forth in Thomas Weisel Partners' written opinion, the
exchange ratio was fair, from a financial point of view, to Chordiant.

   Chordiant determined the exchange ratio through negotiations with Prime
Response. Chordiant did not impose any limitations on Thomas Weisel Partners
with respect to the investigations made or procedures followed in rendering its

   THE FULL TEXT OF THOMAS WEISEL PARTNERS' WRITTEN OPINION, WHICH SETS FORTH,
AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE ASSUMPTIONS MADE, PROCEDURES FOLLOWED, MATTERS
CONSIDERED AND LIMITATIONS ON THE SCOPE OF THE REVIEW UNDERTAKEN BY
THOMAS WEISEL PARTNERS IN DELIVERING ITS OPINION, IS ATTACHED AS ANNEX C TO
THIS JOINT PROXY STATEMENT/PROSPECTUS. YOU SHOULD READ THIS OPINION CAREFULLY
AND IN ITS ENTIRETY. THE FOLLOWING DESCRIPTION OF THE THOMAS WEISEL PARTNERS'
OPINION IS ONLY A SUMMARY OF THE WRITTEN OPINION AND IS QUALIFIED IN ITS
ENTIRETY BY THE WRITTEN OPINION AND IS NOT A SUBSTITUTE FOR THE WRITTEN
OPINION.

   THOMAS WEISEL PARTNERS DIRECTED ITS OPINION TO THE CHORDIANT BOARD OF
DIRECTORS. THE OPINION DOES NOT CONSTITUTE A RECOMMENDATION TO THE STOCKHOLDERS
OF CHORDIANT AS TO HOW THEY SHOULD VOTE WITH RESPECT TO THE ISSUANCE OF SHARES
OF CHORDIANT COMMON STOCK IN THE MERGER. THE OPINION ADDRESSES ONLY THE
FINANCIAL FAIRNESS OF THE EXCHANGE RATIO IN THE MERGER. IT DOES NOT ADDRESS THE
RELATIVE MERITS OF THE MERGER OR ANY ALTERNATIVES TO THE MERGER. FURTHER, IT
DOES NOT ADDRESS THE BUSINESS DECISION OF THE CHORDIANT BOARD OF DIRECTORS TO
PROCEED WITH OR CONSUMMATE THE MERGER.

   In connection with its opinion, Thomas Weisel Partners, among other things:

  . reviewed certain publicly available financial and other data with respect
    to Chordiant and Prime Response, including the consolidated financial
    statements for recent years and for the most recent fiscal quarters for
    which published results are available, and certain other relevant
    financial and operating data relating to Chordiant and Prime Response
    made available to Thomas Weisel Partners from published sources and from
    the internal records of Chordiant and Prime Response;

  . reviewed the financial terms and conditions of the merger agreement;

  . reviewed certain publicly available information concerning the trading
    of, and the trading market for, Chordiant common stock and Prime Response
    common stock;

  . compared Chordiant and Prime Response from a financial point of view with
    certain other companies in the software industry which Thomas Weisel
    Partners deemed to be relevant;

  . considered the financial terms, to the extent publicly available, of
    selected recent business combinations of companies in the software
    industry which Thomas Weisel Partners deemed to be comparable in whole or
    in part, to the merger;

  . reviewed and discussed with representatives of the management of
    Chordiant and Prime Response certain information of a business and
    financial nature regarding Chordiant and Prime Response, furnished to
    Thomas Weisel Partners by Chordiant and Prime Response, including
    financial forecasts and related assumptions of Chordiant and Prime
    Response;

  . made inquiries regarding and discussed the merger and the merger
    agreement and other matters related thereto with counsel for Chordiant;
    and

  . performed such other analyses and examinations as Thomas Weisel Partners
    deemed appropriate.

   In preparing its opinion, Thomas Weisel Partners did not assume any
responsibility independently to verify the information referred to above.
Instead, with the consent of Chordiant, Thomas Weisel Partners relied on the
information being accurate and complete. Thomas Weisel Partners also made the
following assumptions, in each case with the consent of Chordiant:

  . with respect to the financial forecasts of Chordiant and Prime Response
    provided to Thomas Weisel Partners by Chordiant's management, upon their
    advice and with Chordiant's consent, Thomas Weisel Partners assumed for
    purposes of its opinion that such forecasts (a) had been reasonably
    prepared on bases reflecting the best available estimates and judgments
    of Chordiant's management at the time of preparation as to the future
    financial performance of Chordiant and Prime Response and (b) provided a
    reasonable basis upon which Thomas Weisel Partners could form its
    opinion;

  . that there have been no material changes in the assets, financial
    condition, results of operations, business or prospects of Chordiant or
    Prime Response since the respective dates of the last financial
    statements made available to Thomas Weisel Partners;

  . that the merger will be consummated in a manner that complies in all
    respects with the applicable provisions of the Securities Act of 1933,
    the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and all other applicable federal and
    state statutes, rules and regulations;

  . that the merger would be treated as a tax-free reorganization, pursuant
    to the United States Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended;

  . that the merger would be recorded as a purchase under U.S. generally
    accepted accounting principles;

  . that, in the course of obtaining the necessary regulatory approvals for
    the merger, no restrictions, including any divestiture requirements, will
    be imposed that could have a meaningful effect on the contemplated
    benefits of the merger; and

  . that the merger will be consummated substantially in accordance with the
    terms described in the merger agreement, without any further amendments
    thereto, and without waiver by Chordiant or Prime Response of any of the
    conditions of their respective obligations thereunder.

   In addition, for purposes of its opinion:

  . Thomas Weisel Partners did not assume responsibility for making an
    independent evaluation, appraisal or physical inspection of any of the
    assets or liabilities (contingent or otherwise) of Chordiant or Prime
    Response, nor was Thomas Weisel Partners furnished with any such
    appraisals;

  . Thomas Weisel Partners relied on advice of counsel and independent
    accountants to Chordiant as to all legal and financial reporting matters
    with respect to Prime Response, the merger, the merger agreement,
    including the legal status and financial reporting of litigation
    involving Prime Response; and

  . Thomas Weisel Partners' opinion was based on economic, monetary, market
    and other conditions as in effect on, and the information made available
    to Thomas Weisel Partners as of, the date of its opinion. Accordingly,
    although subsequent developments may affect its opinion, Thomas Weisel
    Partners has not assumed any obligation to update, revise or reaffirm its
    opinion.

   The following represents a brief summary of the material financial analyses
performed by Thomas Weisel Partners in connection with providing its opinion to
the Chordiant board of directors. Some of the summaries of financial analyses
performed by Thomas Weisel Partners include information presented in tabular
format. In order to fully understand the financial analyses performed by Thomas
Weisel Partners, you should read the tables together with the text of each
summary. The tables alone do not constitute a complete description of the
financial analyses. Considering the data set forth in the tables without
considering the full narrative description of the financial analyses, including
the methodologies and assumptions underlying the analyses, could create a
misleading or incomplete view of the financial analyses performed by Thomas
Weisel Partners.

   Comparable Company Analysis. Based on public and other available
information, Thomas Weisel Partners calculated the multiples of aggregate
value, which Thomas Weisel Partners defined as market capitalization plus debt
less cash and cash equivalents, to calendar year 2000 and 2001 estimated
revenues for ten companies in the software industry. In each case, Thomas
Weisel Partners used estimates based on public filings, news articles,
published Wall Street research analysts' reports and forecasts and other third
party sources. Thomas Weisel Partners believes that the selected ten companies
listed below have operations similar to some of the operations of Prime
Response, but noted that none of these companies have the same management,
composition, size or combination of businesses as Prime Response:

  . Accrue Software, Inc.;

  . Apropos Technology, Inc.;

  . Ecometry Corporation;

  . EGain Communications Corporation;

  . Engage, Inc.;

  . Epicor Software Corporation;

  . Exchange Applications, Inc.;

  . Interact Commerce Corporation;

  . Pegasystems Inc.; and

  . Primus Knowledge Solutions, Inc.

   The following tables set forth the multiples indicated by this analysis for
the selected ten software companies:

                                                          Range of
   Aggregate Value to:                                    Multiples  Mean Median
   -------------------                                   ----------- ---- ------

   Estimated 2000 Revenues.............................. (0.2x)-2.2x 1.1x  1.1x
   Estimated 2001 Revenues.............................. (0.2x)-1.4x 0.7x  0.6x

   While the comparable company analysis compared Prime Response to ten
companies in the software industry, Thomas Weisel Partners did not include
every company that could be deemed to be a participant in this same industry,
or in any specific sectors of this industry.

   Thomas Weisel Partners noted that the aggregate value of the consideration
to be received by stockholders of Prime Response in connection with the merger
implied a ratio of Prime Response's aggregate value to (1) calendar year 2000
estimated revenues of 0.2x and (2) calendar year 2001 estimated revenues of
0.1x.

   Comparable Transactions Analysis. Based on public and other available
information, Thomas Weisel Partners calculated the multiples of aggregate value
to (1) last twelve months (LTM) revenues and (2) next twelve months (NTM)
revenues in the following six comparable acquisitions of software companies
that were announced from January 1, 1999 to December 31, 2000:

   Announcement Date           Name of Acquiror                Name of Target
   -----------------           ----------------                --------------

      6/20/00             Brokat Infosystems AG             Blaze Software, Inc.
      1/26/00             Broadvision, Inc.                 Interleaf, Inc.
     10/18/99             Nortel Networks Corporation       Clarify Inc.
     10/11/99             PeopleSoft, Inc.                  Vantive Corp.
      8/23/99             Sun Microsystems, Inc.            Forte Software, Inc.
      4/5/99              Lucent Technologies Inc.          Mosaix, Inc.

   The following table sets forth the multiples indicated by this analysis and
the multiples implied by the merger:

                                                   Range of
   Aggregate Value to:                            Multiples  Mean  Median Merger
   -------------------                            ---------- ----- ------ ------

   LTM Revenue................................... 1.1x-27.2x 10.2x  7.7x   0.2x
   NTM Revenue................................... 0.9x-16.5x  8.4x  6.3x   0.1x

   In each case, Thomas Weisel Partners used estimates based on public filings,
news articles, published Wall Street research analysts' reports and forecasts
and other third party sources. No transaction used in the comparable company or
comparable transactions analyses is identical to Chordiant or Prime Response or
the merger. Accordingly, an analysis of the results of the foregoing is not
mathematical; rather, it involves complex considerations and judgments
concerning differences in financial and operating characteristics of the
companies and other factors that could affect the public trading value of the
companies to which Chordiant, Prime Response, and the merger are being
compared.

   Premiums Paid Analysis. Thomas Weisel Partners reviewed certain publicly
available statistics for thirty comparable transactions in the technology
sector that were announced from January 1, 1999 to December 31, 2000. The
following table present the indicated premiums paid above the average of the
exchange ratios based on daily closing share prices of Chordiant and Prime
Response one day before the announcement of the transaction, five trading days
before the announcement of the transaction and twenty trading days before the
announcement of the transaction.

                                                       Range of
                                                     Percentages   Mean  Median
                                                    -------------- ----- ------

Exchange Rate Premium One Day Prior to
 Announcement.....................................  (13.4%)-169.0% 40.4% 30.2%
Exchange Rate Premium Five Trading Days Prior to
 Announcement.....................................  (12.0%)-171.8% 40.8% 37.4%
Exchange Rate Premium Twenty Trading Days Prior to
 Announcement.....................................  (29.6%)-183.3% 40.6% 36.5%

   Thomas Weisel Partners noted that the exchange ratio premium implied by the
merger for the period one day, five trading days, and twenty trading days prior
to the date of Thomas Weisel Partners' analyses was 100.0%, 66.1%, and 15.1%,
respectively.

   Contribution Analysis. Thomas Weisel Partners used the estimates and
financial forecasts prepared by (1) Chordiant's management, referred to as the
Revised Case, and (2) third party analysts, referred to as the Street Case,
with respect to Chordiant and Prime Response in order to perform a contribution
analysis. On the basis of these estimates and financial forecasts, Thomas
Weisel Partners reviewed the contribution of each of Chordiant and Prime
Response to projected revenue for calendar years 2000 and 2001, for the
combined company. Thomas Weisel Partners then compared these contributions to
the forecasted share ownership of the combined company to be held by the
stockholders of each of Chordiant and Prime Response, assuming consummation of
the merger as described in the merger agreement.

   The following tables set forth the relative contributions indicated by this
analysis and the forecasted ownership of the combined company:

                       Revised Case                     Chordiant Prime Response
                       ------------                     --------- --------------

    Calendar 2000 Projected............................   52.0%       48.0%
    Calendar 2001 Projected............................   59.0%       41.0%

                        Street Case                     Chordiant Prime Response
                        -----------                     --------- --------------

    Calendar 2000 Projected............................   52.0%       48.0%
    Calendar 2001 Projected............................   53.0%       47.0%

                 Pro Forma Share Ownership              Chordiant Prime Response
                 -------------------------              --------- --------------

                                                          77.0%       23.0%

   The foregoing description is only a summary of the analyses and examinations
that Thomas Weisel Partners deems material to its opinion. It is not a
comprehensive description of all analyses and examinations actually conducted
by Thomas Weisel Partners. The preparation of a fairness opinion necessarily is
not susceptible to partial analysis or summary description. Thomas Weisel
Partners believes that its analyses and the summary set forth above must be
considered as a whole and that selecting portions of its analyses and of the
factors considered, without considering all analyses and factors, would create
an incomplete view of the process underlying the analyses set forth in its
presentation to you. In addition, Thomas Weisel Partners may have given some
analyses more or less weight than other analyses, and may have deemed various
assumptions more or less probable than other assumptions. The fact that any
specific analysis has been referred to in the summary above is not meant to
indicate that this analysis was given greater weight than any other analysis.
Accordingly, the ranges of valuations resulting from any particular analysis
described above should not be taken to be the view of Thomas Weisel Partners
with respect to the actual value of Prime Response.

   In performing its analyses, Thomas Weisel Partners made numerous assumptions
with respect to industry performance, general business and economic conditions
and other matters, many of which are beyond the control of Chordiant and Prime
Response. The analyses performed by Thomas Weisel Partners are not necessarily
indicative of actual values or actual future results, which may be
significantly more or less favorable than those suggested by these analyses.
These analyses were prepared solely as part of the analysis performed by Thomas
Weisel Partners with respect to the financial fairness of the exchange ratio in
the merger, and were provided to Chordiant in connection with the delivery of
the Thomas Weisel Partners' opinion. The analyses do not purport to be
appraisals or to reflect the prices at which a company might actually be sold
or the prices at which any securities may trade at any time in the future.

   As described above, Thomas Weisel Partners' opinion and presentation were
among the many factors that the Chordiant board of directors took into
consideration in making its determination to approve, and to recommend that the
stockholders of Chordiant approve the issuance of shares of Chordiant common
stock in the merger.

   Pursuant to an engagement letter dated October 24, 2000, Thomas Weisel
Partners provided financial advisory services and a financial opinion in
connection with the merger, and Chordiant agreed to pay Thomas Weisel Partners
a customary fee in connection therewith. The Chordiant board of directors was
aware of this fee structure and took it into account in considering Thomas
Weisel Partners' opinion and in approving the issuance of shares of Chordiant
common stock in the merger. Further, Chordiant has agreed to reimburse Thomas
Weisel Partners for its reasonable out-of-pocket expenses and to indemnify
Thomas Weisel Partners, its affiliates, and its respective partners, directors,
officers, agents, consultants, employees and controlling persons against
specific liabilities, including liabilities under the federal securities laws.

   In the ordinary course of its business, Thomas Weisel Partners may actively
trade the equity securities of Chordiant and Prime Response for its own account
and for the accounts of customers and, accordingly, may at any time hold a long
or short position in these securities. In addition, Thomas Weisel Partners has
acted as an underwriter in connection with the offerings of securities of
Chordiant and performed various investment banking services for Chordiant.

Opinion of Prime Response's Financial Advisor

   Prime Response engaged Robertson Stephens to provide financial advisory and
investment banking services to Prime Response in connection with the proposed
merger, and to render an opinion as to the fairness of the exchange ratio of
0.60 in the proposed merger, from a financial point of view, to the "holders of
Prime Response common stock." (See Annex D for a copy of the full opinion.) The
"holders of Prime Response common stock" was defined in Robertson Stephens'
written opinion letter to the board of directors of Prime Response, dated
January 5, 2001, as all holders of Prime Response common stock other than
Chordiant, Puccini Acquisition Corp. or any affiliates of Chordiant or Puccini
Acquisition Corp.

   On January 5, 2001, at a meeting of Prime Response's board held to evaluate
the proposed merger, Robertson Stephens delivered its written opinion to Prime
Response's board that, as of January 5, 2001 and based on the assumptions made,
matters considered and the limitations on the review undertaken described in
the opinion, the exchange ratio in the proposed merger was fair from a
financial point of view to the holders of Prime Response common stock. The
exchange ratio was determined through negotiations between the respective
managements of Prime Response and Chordiant. Although Robertson Stephens did
assist the management of Prime Response in those negotiations, it was not asked
by, and did not recommend to, Prime Response that any specific exchange ratio
constituted the appropriate exchange ratio for the merger.

   You should consider the following when reading the discussion of the opinion
of Prime Response's financial advisor in this document:

  . We urge you to read carefully the entire opinion of Robertson Stephens,
    which is set forth in Annex D to this joint proxy statement/prospectus
    and is incorporated herein by reference. The following description of the
    Robertson Stephens opinion is qualified by reference to the full opinion
    located in Annex D. The full opinion sets forth, among other things, the
    assumptions made by Robertson Stephens, the matters it considered and the
    limitations on the review undertaken.

  . The Robertson Stephens opinion was prepared for the information of Prime
    Response's board of directors in connection with its evaluation of the
    merger and does not constitute a recommendation to the stockholders of
    Prime Response or Chordiant as to how they should vote, or take any other
    action, with respect to the merger.

  . The Robertson Stephens opinion did not address the relative merits of the
    merger and the other business strategies that Prime Response's board of
    directors has considered, nor does it address the decision of Prime
    Response's board of directors to proceed with the merger.

  . The Robertson Stephens opinion was necessarily based upon market,
    economic and other conditions that were in effect on, and information
    made available to Robertson Stephens as of, the date of the opinion. You
    should understand that subsequent developments may affect the conclusion
    expressed in the Robertson Stephens opinion, and that Robertson Stephens
    disclaims any undertaking or obligation to advise any person of any
    change in any matter affecting its opinion which may come or be brought
    to Robertson Stephens' attention after the date of its opinion.

  . The Robertson Stephens opinion was limited to the fairness, from a
    financial point of view and as of the date thereof, of the exchange ratio
    in the merger to the holders of Prime Response common stock.

 Opinion and Analysis of Robertson Stephens

   In connection with the preparation of the Robertson Stephens opinion,
Robertson Stephens:

  . reviewed certain publicly available financial statements and other
    business and financial information of Prime Response and Chordiant,
    respectively;

  . reviewed certain internal financial statements and other financial and
    operating data, including certain financial forecasts and other forward-
    looking information, concerning Prime Response prepared by the management
    of Prime Response;

  . reviewed certain publicly available estimates of research analysts
    relating to Prime Response and Chordiant;

  . held discussions with the respective managements of Prime Response and
    Chordiant concerning the businesses, past and current operations,
    financial condition and future prospects of both Prime Response and
    Chordiant, independently and combined, including discussions with the
    managements of Prime Response and Chordiant concerning their views
    regarding the strategic rationale for the merger;

  . reviewed the financial terms and conditions set forth in drafts, dated
    January 5, 2001, of the merger agreement and the voting agreement;

  . reviewed the stock price and trading history of Prime Response common
    stock and Chordiant common stock;

  . compared the financial performance of Prime Response and Chordiant and
    the prices and trading activity of Prime Response common stock and
    Chordiant common stock with that of certain other publicly traded
    companies comparable with Prime Response and Chordiant, respectively;

  . compared the financial terms of the merger with the financial terms, to
    the extent publicly available, of other transactions that Robertson
    Stephens deemed relevant;

  . reviewed the pro forma impact of the merger;

  . prepared an analysis of the relative contributions of Prime Response and
    Chordiant to the combined company;

  . participated in discussions and negotiations among representatives of
    Prime Response and Chordiant and their financial and legal advisors; and

  . made such other studies and inquiries, and reviewed such other data, as
    Robertson Stephens deemed relevant.

   In its review and analysis, and in arriving at its opinion, Robertson
Stephens assumed and relied upon the accuracy and completeness of all of the
financial and other information provided to it (including information furnished
to it orally or otherwise discussed with it by the managements of Prime
Response and Chordiant) or publicly available and neither attempted to verify,
nor assumed responsibility for verifying, any of such information. Robertson
Stephens relied upon the assurances of the managements of Prime Response and
Chordiant that they were not aware of any facts that would make such
information inaccurate or misleading. Furthermore, Robertson Stephens did not
obtain or make, or assume any responsibility for obtaining or making, any
independent evaluation or appraisal of the properties, assets or liabilities
(contingent or otherwise) of Prime Response or Chordiant, nor was it furnished
with any such evaluation or appraisal.

   In addition, Robertson Stephens assumed that:

  . the merger will be consummated upon the terms set forth in the drafts,
    dated January 5, 2001, of the merger agreement and the voting agreement
    without material alteration thereof, including, among other things, that
    the merger will be accounted for as a "purchase method" business
    combination in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting
    principles;

  . the merger will be treated as a tax-free reorganization pursuant to the
    Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended; and

  . the historical financial statements of each of Prime Response and
    Chordiant reviewed by Robertson Stephens were prepared and fairly
    presented in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting
    principles consistently applied.

   Robertson Stephens relied as to all legal matters relevant to rendering its
opinion on the advice of counsel to Prime Response.

   Robertson Stephens expressed no opinion as to:

  . the value of any employee agreement or other arrangement entered into in
    connection with the merger;

  . any tax or other consequences that may result from the merger; or

  . what the value of the Chordiant common stock will be when issued to Prime
    Response's stockholders pursuant to the merger or the price at which the
    shares of Chordiant's common stock that are issued pursuant to the merger
    may be traded in the future.

   The following is a summary of the material financial analyses performed by
Robertson Stephens in connection with rendering its opinion. The summary of the
financial analyses is not a complete description of all of the analyses
performed by Robertson Stephens. Certain of the information in this section is
presented in tabular form. In order to better understand the financial analyses
performed by Robertson Stephens, these tables must be read together with the
text accompanying each table. The opinion is based upon the totality of the
various analyses performed by Robertson Stephens and no particular portion of
the analyses has any merit standing alone.

years 2000 and 2001, based upon the closing stock prices as of January 4, 2001,
and corresponding multiples for Prime Response in the merger based upon a 0.60
exchange ratio and the closing stock price of Chordiant common stock as of
January 4, 2001:

                            TEV/          TEV/      Equity Value/ Equity Value/

   Revenue data for the selected publicly traded companies and for Prime
Response were obtained from research analysts estimates.

 Selected Precedent Transactions Analysis

   Using publicly available information, Robertson Stephens analyzed the
aggregate value and the adjusted aggregate value multiples of the following
selected acquisition transactions in the eBusiness software industry (listing
the targets followed by the acquiror and with the date these transactions were

   In analyzing these "precedent transactions," Robertson Stephens compared,
among other things, the adjusted aggregate value in such transactions as a
multiple of the latest twelve months' ("LTM") revenues, as of the time of the
transaction, and the next twelve months' ("NTM") estimated revenues. Adjusted
aggregate value means the aggregate value of the selected precedent transaction
as adjusted to reflect the subsequent stock performance of the acquiror and is
based on the exchange ratio of the transaction and the January 4, 2001 acquiror
stock price. All multiples for the precedent transactions were derived from
publicly available information. Based on this information and other publicly
available information, the following table illustrates the adjusted aggregate
value ratios from these transactions and the corresponding ratio for the
proposed merger:

                             Adjusted Aggregate Value/ Adjusted Aggregate Value/
   Multiples                       LTM Revenues              NTM Revenues

 Exchange Ratio Premiums Analysis

   Robertson Stephens reviewed and analyzed the exchange ratio premiums paid in
the precedent transactions listed above using a range of one day, one week and
one month prior to the announcement of each transaction. The exchange ratio
premium is the premium over the target company's stock price that the
transaction consideration represents (calculated by multiplying the exchange
ratio in the transaction by the acquiror's stock price at the indicated time).
The one week and one month exchange ratio premiums were based on average
exchange ratios for such periods prior to the announcement of the transaction.
The following table sets forth the range of exchange ratio premiums for those
transactions and the corresponding exchange ratio premium in the proposed
merger:

                                                          1 Day  1 Week  1 Month

 Price Premiums Analysis

   Robertson Stephens reviewed and analyzed the purchase price premiums paid on
all domestic high-tech transactions during the year 2000 with equity
transaction values between $25 million and $200 million for one day, one week
and one month prior to the announcement of the transaction. The following table
sets forth the range of purchase price premiums and the corresponding purchase
price premium in the proposed merger:

                                                          1 Day  1 Week  1 Month

 Other Factors

   No company, business or transaction compared in any of the above analyses is
identical to Prime Response, Chordiant or the proposed merger. Accordingly, an
analysis of the results of the foregoing is not entirely mathematical; rather
it involves complex considerations and judgments concerning differences in
financial and operating characteristics and other factors that could affect the
public trading, acquisition and other values of the comparable companies,
precedent transactions or the business segment, company or transaction to which
they are being compared. In addition, various analyses performed by Robertson
Stephens incorporate projections prepared by research analysts using only
publicly available information. These estimates may or may not prove to be
accurate.

   While this summary describes the analysis and factors that Robertson
Stephens deemed material in its presentation to the Prime Response board, it is
not a comprehensive description of all analysis and factors considered by
Robertson Stephens. The preparation of a fairness opinion is a complex process
that involves various determinations as to the most appropriate and relevant
methods of financial analysis and the application of these methods to the
particular circumstances. Therefore, a fairness opinion is not readily
susceptible to partial analysis or summary description. In arriving at its
opinion, Robertson Stephens did not attribute any particular weight to any
analysis or factor considered by it, but rather made qualitative judgments as
to the significance and relevance of each analysis and factor. Accordingly,
Robertson Stephens believes that its analyses must be considered as a whole and
that selecting portions of its analyses and of the factors considered by it,
without considering all analyses and factors, could create a misleading or
incomplete view of the evaluation process underlying its opinion. Several
analytical methodologies were employed and no one method of analysis should be
regarded as critical to the overall conclusion reached by Robertson Stephens.
Each analytical technique has inherent strengths and weaknesses, and the nature
of the available information may further affect the value of particular
techniques. The conclusion reached by Robertson Stephens is based on all
analyses and factors taken as a whole and also on application of Robertson
Stephens' own experience and judgment. This conclusion may involve significant
elements of subjective judgment and qualitative analysis. Robertson Stephens
expresses no opinion as to the value or merit standing alone of any one or more
parts of the analysis it performed. In performing its analyses, Robertson
Stephens made numerous assumptions with respect to industry performance,
general business and other conditions and matters, many of which are beyond the
control of Prime Response, Chordiant or Robertson Stephens. Any estimates
contained in these analyses are not necessarily indicative of actual values or
predictive of future results or values, which may be significantly more or less
favorable than those suggested by these analyses. Accordingly, analyses
relating to the value of businesses do not purport to be appraisals or to
reflect the prices at which these businesses actually may be sold in the
future, and these estimates are inherently subject to uncertainty.

   The engagement letter dated October 4, 1999 between Robertson Stephens and
Prime Response provides that, for its services, Robertson Stephens is entitled
to receive usual and customary fees in connection with the transaction and the
delivery of the opinion, and with respect to the opinion fee, such fee is
payable without regard to the conclusion reached in the opinion. The payment of
Robertson Stephens' fees, other than the fee payable on the delivery of the
opinion, is contingent upon the consummation of the merger. Prime Response has
also agreed to reimburse Robertson Stephens for its reasonable and customary
out-of-pocket expenses related to this work, including legal fees, and to
indemnify and hold harmless Robertson Stephens and its affiliates and any other
person, director, employee or agent of Robertson Stephens or any of its
affiliates, or any person controlling Robertson Stephens or its affiliates, for
certain losses, claims, damages, expenses and liabilities relating to or
arising out of services provided by Robertson Stephens as financial advisor to
Prime Response. The terms of the fee arrangement with Robertson Stephens, which
Prime Response and Robertson Stephens believe are customary in transactions of
this nature, were negotiated at arm's length between Prime Response and
Robertson Stephens, and the Prime Response board was aware of these fee
arrangements.

   In the past, Robertson Stephens has provided certain investment banking
services to Prime Response, including acting as lead manager for Prime
Response's filing of an initial public offering, for which it has been paid
customary fees. Robertson Stephens maintains a market in the shares of Prime
Response and Chordiant. In

the ordinary course of its business, Robertson Stephens may actively trade
securities of Prime Response or Chordiant for its own account and for the
account of its customers and, accordingly, may at any time hold a long or short
position in the securities of Prime Response or Chordiant.

   Robertson Stephens is an internationally recognized investment banking firm
and was retained based on its experience as a financial advisor in connection
with mergers and acquisitions and in securities valuations generally. As part
of its investment banking business, Robertson Stephens is frequently engaged in
the valuation of businesses and their securities in connection with mergers and
acquisitions, negotiated underwritings, secondary distributions of securities,
private placements and other purposes.

Interests of Chordiant's Officers and Directors in the Merger

   In considering the recommendation of the Chordiant board of directors with
respect to approving the issuance of Chordiant common stock in the merger,
Chordiant stockholders should be aware that certain members of the board of
directors and management of Chordiant have interests in the merger that are in
addition to the interests of stockholders of Chordiant in general. The
Chordiant board of directors was aware of these interests and considered them,
among other matters, in approving the issuance of Chordiant common stock in the
merger.

   Combined Company Board of Directors. The merger agreement provides that
after the effective time of the merger, the board of directors of the combined
company shall consist of ten directors, nine of whom shall be designated by
Chordiant and one of whom shall be designated by Prime Response.

   Combined Company Executive Officers. Mr. Spadafora will continue to serve as
chief executive officer and chairman of the board of directors of Chordiant
after the effective time of the merger.

Interests of Prime Response's Officers and Directors in the Merger

   Combined Company Board of Directors. The merger agreement provides that
after the effective time of the merger, the board of directors of the combined
company shall consist of ten directors, nine of whom shall be designed by
Chordiant and one of whom shall be designated by Prime Response. The director
designated by Prime Response will be William E. Ford, who is currently a
director of Prime Response.

   Prime Response Stock Options being assumed by Chordiant. As of December 31,
2000, Prime Response's executive officers, directors and their affiliates, held
options to purchase a total of 436,622 shares of Prime Response common stock,
at exercise prices ranging from $3.4133 to $29.06 per share, of which 179,810
shares were vested.

  Separation Agreements; Employment Agreements.

   Under the terms of an agreement between Prime Response and Peter Boni dated
February 13, 2001 entered into in connection with his resignation as President,
Chief Executive Officer and a director of Prime Response as of January 31,
2001, Mr. Boni is entitled to receive (i) the continuation of his base salary
at the current annualized rate of $300,000 for a period of twelve months, (ii)
a bonus of $145,000 to be paid in 12 equal monthly installments, (iii) the
continuation of his benefit package for a period of twelve months and (iv) a
one time severance payment of $10,000. In addition, as of the date of this
agreement, all of Prime Response's repurchase rights on the 636,225 shares of
Prime Response common stock held by Mr. Boni have terminated. In addition,
Prime Response acknowledged and agreed that the promissory note dated June 1,
1999, evidencing a loan by Prime Response to Peter Boni in the amount of
$2,544,900, is not due and payable until January 31, 2009, and that the holder
of the promissory note will not seek payment of the note prior to that date.

   Under the terms of an agreement between Prime Response and Frederick
Phillips dated January 31, 2001 entered into in connection with his resignation
as Chief Financial Officer of Prime Response as of January 31, 2001, Mr.
Phillips is entitled to receive (i) the continuation of his base salary at the
current annualized rate of $180,000 for a period of twelve months, (ii) a bonus
of $63,000 to be paid in 12 equal monthly installments,

(iii) the continuation of his benefit package for a period of twelve months and
(iv) a one time severance payment of $10,000. In addition, all the 93,750
options to purchase shares of Prime Response common stock held by Mr. Phillips
became immediately exercisable in full as of the date of this agreement. All
options must be exercised by Mr. Phillips by January 31, 2002.

   Under the terms of an agreement between Prime Response and James Carling
dated January 31, 2001, entered into in connection with his resignation as
Chief Technology Officer of Prime Response as of January 18, 2001, Mr. Carling
is entitled to receive the payment of two months of his base salary at the
current annualized rate of $250,000.

   Under the terms of an agreement between Prime Response and Paul Lavallee
dated October 22, 1999, in the event that Mr. Lavallee's employment is
terminated without cause, or if Mr. Lavallee is asked to take a position of
lesser responsibility or is not granted a promotion in the event that a higher
position is created or vacated, he is entitled to receive twelve months of base
salary and bonus, vesting in an additional year of stock options to be
exercised within one year of termination as well as his benefit package. In
addition, if Mr. Lavallee's employment is terminated, or if he is asked to
assume a position of lesser responsibility upon a change of control, all
options to purchase shares of Prime Response common stock held by Mr. Lavallee
shall become fully vested and he will receive paid health and life insurance
for one year. Mr. Lavallee resigned as Prime Response's President, the Americas
on January 12, 2001.

   Under the terms of an agreement between Prime Response and Allen Swann, Mr.
Swann's employment may be terminated by either party upon six months' notice.
Prime Response may elect to pay Mr. Swann six months salary instead of giving
the required notice under the agreement or may place Mr. Swann on "gardening
leave," during which time Mr. Swann would cease to perform his job
responsibilities, but would be prohibited from undertaking other employment. In
addition, pursuant to a letter dated June 16, 2000, all unvested options
currently held by Mr. Swann will vest in full on June 30, 2001. Under the terms
of a letter agreement between Chordiant and Allen Swann, Prime Response's
current Chief Executive Officer and President, dated January 18, 2001,
conditional upon the merger being completed, Mr. Swann will be employed by
Chordiant as Executive Operations Officer of Worldwide Field Operations. Under
the terms of this agreement, Mr. Swann's annual base salary will be $275,000,
he will be eligible to earn up to an additional $725,000 in discretionary
incentive compensation, to be paid quarterly, and he will be eligible to
receive a $300,000 retention bonus after he has completed 3 months of
employment with Chordiant after the merger is completed. Pursuant to the terms
of the agreement and subject to the approval of the Chordiant board of
directors, Mr. Swann will also be eligible to receive options to acquire
approximately 196,000 shares of Chordiant common stock.

   Under the terms of an agreement between Prime Response and Gary Daniels
dated November 30, 1998, Mr. Daniels' employment may be terminated by either
party upon six months notice. Prime Response may elect to pay Mr. Daniels six
months salary instead of giving the required notice under the agreement or may
place Mr. Daniels on "gardening leave," during which time Mr. Daniels would
cease to perform his job responsibilities, but would nevertheless be prohibited
from undertaking other employment. Under the terms of a letter agreement
between Chordiant and Gary Daniels, Prime Response's current Vice President,
Product Development, executed on January 24, 2001, conditional upon the merger
being completed, Mr. Daniels will be employed by Chordiant as Vice President of
Engineering. Under the terms of this agreement, Mr. Daniels' annual base salary
will be $210,000 and he will be eligible to earn up to 50% of his base salary
in incentive compensation. Pursuant to the terms of the agreement and subject
to the approval of the Chordiant board of directors, Mr. Daniels will also be
eligible to receive options to acquire approximately 213,000 shares of
Chordiant common stock.

   Under the terms of agreements between Prime Response and James Plantan dated
August 11, 1999 and July 28, 1999, if Mr. Plantan's employment is terminated
without cause he is entitled to receive severance pay and medical benefits for
a period of six months and 100% of all outstanding options to purchase shares
of Prime Response common stock held by Mr. Plantan will become immediately
exercisable. Mr. Plantan does not intend to work for either Prime Response or
Chordiant after the merger is completed.

   Under the terms of an agreement dated February 29, 2000 between Steven Gal
and Prime Response, if Mr. Gal is terminated without cause upon a change in
control of Prime Response, Mr. Gal will be offered a severance program that
continues for one year which includes (i) his cash compensation of base salary
and incentive potential compensation, (ii) paid health and life insurance and
(iii) 100% vesting of all outstanding options to purchase shares of Prime
Response common stock held by Mr. Gal. If Mr. Gal is terminated without cause
(unrelated to a change of control), if his position is eliminated, or if he is
offered a position of lesser responsibility, Mr. Gal will be entitled to
receive his base salary and incentive potential compensation, paid life and
health insurance for one year, and an additional year of vesting of his
outstanding stock options provided that he exercises such options within one
year of termination. Mr. Gal is not required to mitigate his damages or offset
any payments by a new employer. Mr. Gal resigned as Vice President of Marketing
for Prime Response on February 20, 2001.

   Indemnification and Insurance. Chordiant has agreed in the merger agreement
that all rights to indemnification existing in favor of those persons who are
directors and officers of Prime Response as of the date of merger for their
acts and omissions occurring prior to the effective time of the merger, as
provided in Prime Response's bylaws, as in effect as of the date of the merger
agreement shall survive the merger and shall be observed by Prime Response to
the fullest extent available under Delaware law for a period of six years from
the date of completion of the merger. Chordiant also has agreed to maintain
directors' and officers' liability insurance for Prime Response's directors and
officers equivalent to Prime Response's current insurance for not less than
three years after the effective time of the merger.

   As a result of the foregoing, the directors and executive officers of Prime
Response may be more likely to vote for the adoption of the merger agreement
than Prime Response stockholders generally.

Material Federal Income Tax Consequences

   In the opinion of Cooley Godward LLP and Hale and Dorr LLP, the following
discussion summarizes the material United States federal income tax
considerations of the merger that are expected to apply generally to Prime
Response stockholders upon an exchange of their Prime Response common stock for
Chordiant common stock in the merger. This summary is based upon current
provisions of the Internal Revenue Code, existing regulations under the
Internal Revenue Code and current administrative rulings and court decisions,
all of which are subject to change. Any change, which may or may not be
retroactive, could alter the tax consequences to the stockholders of Prime
Response as described in this summary. No attempt has been made to comment on
all federal income tax consequences of the merger that may be relevant to
particular Prime Response stockholders, who may be subject to special rules,
such as:

  . a broker or dealer in securities or currencies;

  . a trader in securities that elects to use a mark-to-market method of
    accounting for securities holdings;

  . a bank, thrift, regulated investment company or other financial
    institution or finance service company;

  . an insurance company;

  . a tax-exempt organization;

  . a person who holds shares of Prime Response common stock or will hold
    Chordiant common stock as part of a straddle or a hedging, integrated,
    constructive sale or conversion transaction or other risk reduction
    strategy for tax purposes;

  . a person whose functional currency for tax purposes is not the U.S.
    dollar;

  . a person liable for alternative minimum tax;

  . a person who acquired shares of Prime Response common stock or Chordiant
    common stock through stock option or stock purchase programs or in other
    compensatory transactions;

  . a foreign person; or

  . a person who is a United States expatriate.

   In addition, the following discussion does not address the tax consequences
of the merger under state, local and foreign tax laws. Furthermore, the
following discussion does not address:

  . the tax consequences of transactions effectuated before, after or at the
    same time as the merger, whether or not they are in connection with the
    merger, including, without limitation, transactions in which Prime
    Response shares are acquired or Chordiant shares are disposed of;

  . the tax consequences to holders of options or warrants issued by Prime
    Response that are assumed, exercised or converted, as the case may be, in
    connection with the merger; or

  . the tax consequences of the receipt of Chordiant shares other than in
    exchange for Prime Response shares.

   Accordingly, holders of Prime Response common stock are advised and expected
to consult their own tax advisors regarding the federal income tax consequences
of the merger in light of their personal circumstances and the consequences
under state, local and foreign tax laws.

   Cooley Godward LLP and Hale and Dorr LLP, as a condition to the closing,
must render tax opinions that the merger will constitute a reorganization
within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code (a
"Reorganization"). These tax opinions discussed in this section assume and will
be conditioned upon the following:

  . the truth and accuracy of the statements, covenants, representations and
    warranties contained in the merger agreement, in the tax representations
    received from Chordiant, Puccini Acquisition Corp. and Prime Response to
    support the tax opinions and in all other instruments and documents
    related to the formation, organization and operation of Chordiant,
    Puccini Acquisition Corp. and Prime Response examined by and relied upon
    by Cooley Godward LLP and Hale and Dorr LLP in connection with the
    merger;

  . that original documents submitted to such counsel are authentic, that
    documents submitted to such counsel as copies conform to the original
    documents and that all of these documents have been, or will be by the
    effective time of the merger, duly and validly executed and delivered
    where due execution and delivery are a prerequisite to the effectiveness
    of these documents;

  . that all covenants contained in the merger agreement and the tax
    representations described above are performed without waiver or breach of
    any material provision of these covenants; and

  . that any representation or statement made "to the best of knowledge" or
    similarly qualified is correct without that qualification.

   No ruling from the Internal Revenue Service has been or will be requested in
connection with the merger. In addition, stockholders of Prime Response should
be aware that the tax opinions discussed in this section are not binding on the
IRS; the IRS could adopt a contrary position and a contrary position could be
sustained by a court.

   Assuming the merger constitutes a Reorganization for federal income tax
purposes, the following federal income tax consequences will result to Prime
Response stockholders:

  . stockholders of Prime Response will not recognize any gain or loss upon
    the receipt of solely Chordiant common stock for their Prime Response
    common stock;

  . the aggregate basis of the shares of Chordiant common stock received by a
    Prime Response stockholder in the merger, including any fractional share
    deemed received, will be the same as the aggregate basis of the shares of
    Prime Response common stock exchanged therefor;

  . the holding period of the shares of Chordiant common stock received by a
    Prime Response stockholder in the merger will include the holding period
    of the shares of Prime Response common stock exchanged therefor, provided
    that such shares of Prime Response common stock are held as capital
    assets at the effective time of the merger; and

  . a stockholder of Prime Response who receives cash in lieu of a fractional
    share will recognize gain or loss equal to the difference, if any,
    between such stockholder's basis in the fractional share and the amount
    of cash received. Such gain or loss will be a capital gain or loss if the
    Prime Response common stock to which the fractional share interest is
    allocable is held by such stockholder as a capital asset at the effective
    time of the merger.

   In addition to the foregoing, there are other tax-related issues that you
should be aware of, such as:

  . Reporting Requirements. Each Prime Response stockholder that receives
    Chordiant common stock in the merger will be required to file a statement
    with his, her or its federal income tax return setting forth the
    stockholder's basis in the Prime Response stock exchanged and the fair
    market value of the Chordiant stock and any cash received in the merger,
    and to retain permanent records of these facts relating to the merger.

  . Backup Withholding. Unless an exemption applies under applicable law and
    regulations, the exchange agent for Chordiant common stock is required to
    withhold, and will withhold, 31% of any cash payments to a Prime Response
    stockholder in the merger unless the stockholder provides the appropriate
    form as described below. Each Prime Response stockholder should complete
    and sign the substitute Form W-9 included as part of the letter of
    transmittal to be sent to each Prime Response stockholder, so as to
    provide the information, including such stockholder's taxpayer
    identification number, and certification necessary to avoid backup
    withholding, unless an applicable exemption exists and is proved in a
    manner satisfactory to Chordiant and the exchange agent.

  . Consequences of IRS Challenge. A successful IRS challenge to the status
    of the merger as a Reorganization would result in significant tax
    consequences. Prime Response stockholders would recognize gain or loss
    with respect to each share of Prime Response common stock exchanged in
    the merger. Such gain or loss would be equal to the difference between
    the stockholder's basis in such share and the sum of the fair market
    value, as of the effective time of the merger, of the Chordiant common
    stock received in the merger and any cash received instead of a
    fractional share of Chordiant common stock. In such event, a
    stockholder's aggregate basis in the Chordiant common stock so received
    would equal its fair market value as of the effective time of the merger
    and the stockholder's holding period for such stock would begin the day
    after the merger is consummated.

  . Other Consideration. Even if the merger qualifies as a Reorganization, a
    recipient of Chordiant common stock would recognize income if, for
    example, any such shares were determined to have been received in
    exchange for services, to satisfy obligations or in consideration for
    anything other than the Prime Response common stock exchanged. Generally,
    such income would be taxable as ordinary income upon receipt. In
    addition, to the extent that Prime Response stockholders were treated as
    receiving, directly or indirectly, consideration other than Chordiant
    common stock in exchange for such stockholder's Prime Response common
    stock, gain or loss would have to be recognized.

   The summary of material United States federal income tax consequences set
forth above is intended to provide only a general summary and is not intended
to be a complete analysis or description of all potential federal income tax
consequences of the merger. In addition, the summary does not address tax
consequences that may vary with, or are contingent on, individual
circumstances. Moreover, the summary does not address any non-income tax or any
foreign, state or local tax consequences of the merger. The summary does not
address the tax consequences of any transaction other than the merger.
Accordingly, each Prime Response stockholder is strongly urged to consult with
a tax advisor to determine the particular federal, state, local or foreign
income or other tax consequences of the merger to such stockholder.

Anticipated Accounting Treatment

   The merger is expected to be accounted for as a purchase under U.S.
generally accepted accounting principles.

Governmental Approvals

   Transactions such as the merger are subject to review by the Department of
Justice and the Federal Trade Commission ("FTC") to determine whether they
comply with applicable antitrust laws. Under the provisions of the Hart-Scott-
Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976 ("HSR Act") and the rules promulgated
thereunder, no premerger notification reports must be filed by Chordiant or
Prime Response with the Department of Justice or the FTC in connection with the
merger.

Restrictions on Resales by Affiliates

   The shares of Chordiant common stock to be received by Prime Response
stockholders in the merger will have been registered under the Securities Act
and, except as described in this paragraph, may be freely traded without
restriction. The shares of Chordiant common stock to be issued in the merger
and received by persons who may be considered to be "affiliates," as that term
is defined in Rule 144 under the Securities Act, of Prime Response before the
merger may be resold by them only in transactions permitted by the resale
provisions of Rule 145 under the Securities Act or as otherwise permitted under
the Securities Act. The merger agreement provides that Prime Response will use
all reasonable efforts to obtain a signed affiliate agreement in favor of and
for the benefit of Chordiant from all persons who may be considered affiliates
of Prime Response. Each affiliate agreement signed by an affiliate of Prime
Response provides that the affiliate agrees not to sell, transfer or otherwise
dispose of any shares of Prime Response common stock owned by him, her or it or
any Chordiant common stock received by him, her or it in exchange for shares of
Prime Response common stock in connection with the merger or any additional
shares of capital stock of Prime Response, Chordiant or any subsidiary or
affiliate of Chordiant acquired by such affiliate, whether upon exercise of a
stock option, warrant or conversion of debt securities or otherwise, for a
period of time beginning on the effective date of the affiliate agreement until
such time following the merger as Chordiant publishes financial statements that
include at least thirty days of combined financial results of Chordiant and
Prime Response. The affiliate agreements also provide that these persons will
not sell, transfer or otherwise dispose of any shares of Chordiant common stock
at any time in violation of the Securities Act or the rules and regulations
promulgated under the Securities Act, including Rule 145.

                     CERTAIN TERMS OF THE MERGER AGREEMENT

   The following description of the merger agreement describes certain material
terms of the merger agreement. The full text of the merger agreement is
attached as Annex A to this joint proxy statement/prospectus and is
incorporated herein by reference. You are encouraged to read the entire merger
agreement carefully.

The Merger

   The merger agreement provides that at the effective time of the merger,
Puccini Acquisition Corp. will be merged with and into Prime Response. Upon
completion of the merger, Prime Response will continue as the surviving
corporation and will be a wholly-owned subsidiary of Chordiant and the
directors and officers of Puccini Acquisition Corp. immediately prior to the
effective time of the merger shall become the directors and officers of Prime
Response upon completion of the merger.

Effective Time of the Merger

   The merger will become effective when a certificate of merger executed by
Prime Response is delivered and filed with the Delaware Secretary of State.
Provided that all the conditions to the merger contained in the merger
agreement are satisfied or waived, it is anticipated that the effective time
will occur as soon as practicable following the special meetings.

Manner and Basis of Converting Shares

   The merger agreement provides that at the effective time of the merger, each
outstanding share of Prime Response common stock will automatically be
converted into the right to receive 0.60 of a share of Chordiant common stock.
No fractional shares of Chordiant common stock will be issued in the merger.
Instead, each Prime Response stockholder otherwise entitled to a fractional
share will receive a cash amount (rounded to the nearest whole cent), without
interest, based on the closing price of Chordiant common stock on the Nasdaq
National Market on the date the merger becomes effective.

   Following the effective time of the merger, EquiServe LP, who has been
selected by Chordiant to act as exchange agent, will mail to each record holder
of Prime Response common stock a letter indicating that the merger has been
completed. Record holders of Prime Response common stock will also be mailed a
transmittal letter, which record holders will use to exchange Prime Response
common stock certificates for Chordiant common stock certificates and cash for
any fractional share. Holders of Prime Response common stock may contact the
exchange agent by writing to EquiServe LP at 150 Royall Street, Canton, MA
02021. Additionally, holders of Prime Response common stock certificates may,
at their option, physically surrender in person at the offices of the exchange
agent their certificates for certificates evidencing Chordiant common stock and
cash for any fractional share. Prime Response common stock certificates should
not be surrendered for exchange by Prime Response stockholders before the
effective time of the merger. After the effective time of the merger, transfers
of Prime Response common stock will not be registered on the stock transfer
books of Prime Response.

   Until it is surrendered and exchanged, each certificate that previously
evidenced Prime Response common stock will be deemed to evidence the right to
receive shares of Chordiant common stock and the right to receive cash instead
of any fractional share. Chordiant will not pay dividends or other
distributions on any shares of Chordiant common stock to be issued in exchange
for any Prime Response common stock certificate that is not surrendered until
the Prime Response common stock certificate is surrendered as provided in the
merger agreement.

Prime Response Stock Options and Warrants

   At the effective time of the merger, Chordiant will assume all outstanding
Prime Response stock options and warrants. Each outstanding stock option or
warrant assumed by Chordiant will become an option or warrant to purchase a
number of shares of Chordiant common stock determined by multiplying the number
of shares of Prime Response common stock subject to the stock option or warrant
immediately before the effective time of the merger by the 0.60 exchange ratio,
rounding down to the nearest whole share. The exercise price per share of
Chordiant common stock subject to each assumed stock option or warrant will be
equal to the exercise price per share of the Prime Response common stock
subject to the stock option or warrant divided by the exchange ratio, rounding
up to the nearest cent. All other terms and conditions of the stock options and
warrants (including with respect to acceleration) will not change and will
operate in accordance with their terms.

   Instead of assuming outstanding Prime Response stock options and warrants,
Chordiant has the right, under the terms of the merger agreement, to replace
outstanding Prime Response stock options and warrants with substantially
equivalent options and warrants to purchase shares of Chordiant common stock.
If Chordiant decides to substitute options and warrants, the number of shares
covered by the substituted options and warrants and the exercise price of the
substituted options and warrants will be calculated as described in the
preceding paragraph. All other terms of the substitute options and warrants
will be no more or less favorable to the optionee or warrantholder than the
terms of the options and warrants they are replacing.

   Based on the stock options and warrants of Prime Response outstanding at the
record date and assuming no such stock options or warrants are exercised before
the effective time, Chordiant will be required at the effective time to reserve
approximately 2,404,512 shares of Chordiant common stock for issuance upon
exercise of Prime Response stock options and warrants assumed or substituted by
Chordiant in connection with the merger. Under the terms of the merger
agreement, Chordiant will file with the SEC a registration statement relating
to the shares of Chordiant common stock subject to each assumed stock option.

Prime Response's Employee Stock Purchase Plan

   Prime Response's 1999 Employee Stock Purchase Plan will be terminated at the
effective time of the merger. February 28, 2001 will be treated as the last day
of any offering period then underway under the Employee Stock Purchase Plan.
Pro-rata adjustments may be required under the Employee Stock Purchase Plan to
reflect this shortened offering period, but the offering period will otherwise
be treated as a fully effective and completed offering period for all purposes
of the Employee Stock Purchase Plan.

Representations and Warranties

   The merger agreement contains customary representations and warranties of
Prime Response, Chordiant and Puccini Acquisition Corp. relating to, among
other things, certain aspects of the respective businesses and assets of the
parties and other matters. The representations and warranties expire at the
effective time of the merger.

Covenants; Conduct of Business Prior to the Merger

   Affirmative Covenants of Prime Response. Prime Response has agreed that
before the effective time of the merger it will, among other things, and
subject to specified exceptions:

  . except to the extent that such conduct does not result in a breach of any
    other covenant in the merger agreement, ensure that each of Prime
    Response and its subsidiaries conducts their respective businesses and
    operations in the ordinary course and in accordance with past practices
    and in compliance with all applicable legal requirements and the
    requirements of all material contracts;

  . use commercially reasonable efforts to preserve intact its current
    business organization, keep available the services of its current
    officers and employees and maintain its relations and goodwill with all

   suppliers, customers, landlords, creditors, strategic partners, licensors,
   licensees, employees and other persons having business relationships with
   it;

  . keep in full force all insurance policies, provide all notices,
    assurances and support required pursuant to any contract relating to any
    of Prime Response's proprietary assets in order to ensure that no
    condition occurs that could result in any transfer or disclosure by Prime
    Response or any of its subsidiaries of any of Prime Response's or any of
    its subsidiaries' source code or a release from escrow of any of Prime
    Response's or any of its subsidiaries' source code that has been
    previously deposited into escrow;

  . promptly notify Chordiant of: (1) any notice or communication from any
    person alleging that the consent of such person is or may be required in
    connection with the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement;
    and (2) any legal proceeding commenced or to the best of the knowledge of
    Prime Response, threatened against or relating to Prime Response or any
    of its subsidiaries including any legal proceedings that relate to the
    completion of the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement;

  . cause Prime Response's chief executive officer to report regularly, but
    no less frequently than every five business days, to Chordiant concerning
    the status of Prime Response's business and (to the extent requested by
    Chordiant) cause its other officers to report regularly to Chordiant
    regarding Prime Response's business;

  . give Chordiant reasonable advance notice of any meetings of management of
    Prime Response and provide Chordiant with the opportunity to cause a
    designee of Chordiant to attend and participate in meetings of
    management;

  . provide Chordiant access to any of Prime Response's or its subsidiaries'
    offices and facilities at reasonable times and reasonable access to Prime
    Response's personnel, assets, books, records, tax returns and other
    documents and information and provide Chordiant with copies of all
    material operating and financial reports prepared by Prime Response's
    senior management, any written materials sent by Prime Response to its
    stockholders and any notice, report or other document filed with or sent
    to any governmental body in connection with the merger and any material
    notice, report or other document received by Prime Response or any of its
    subsidiaries from any governmental body;

  . promptly notify Chordiant in writing of any event, condition, fact or
    circumstance that occurs, arises or exists on or prior to the date of the
    merger agreement and that would cause or constitute a material inaccuracy
    in any representation or warranty made by Prime Response in the merger
    agreement if such representation or warranty had been made as of the time
    of the occurrence, existence or discovery of such event, condition, fact
    or circumstance, or such event, condition, fact or circumstance had
    occurred, arisen or existed on or prior to the date of the merger
    agreement;

  . promptly notify Chordiant in writing of any material breach of any
    covenant or obligation of Prime Response under the merger agreement;

  . promptly notify Chordiant in writing of any event, condition, fact or
    circumstance that would make the timely satisfaction of any of the
    conditions set forth in the merger agreement impossible or unlikely or
    that has had or could reasonably be expected to have a material adverse
    effect on Prime Response and its subsidiaries;

  . use all reasonable efforts to file all notices, reports and other
    documents required to be filed with any governmental body with respect to
    the merger and the other transactions contemplated by the merger
    agreement, including any notifications required under the HSR Act and any
    applicable foreign antitrust laws or regulations in connection with the
    merger and to submit promptly any additional information requested by any
    such governmental body;

  . use all commercially reasonable efforts to take, or cause to be taken,
    all actions necessary to consummate the merger and make effective the
    other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, including (1)
    making all filings, if any, and giving all notices, if any, required to
    be made and given by Prime Response in connection with the merger and the
    other transactions contemplated by

   the merger agreement, (2) using all reasonable efforts to obtain each
   consent, if any, required to be obtained by Prime Response in connection
   with the merger or any of the other transactions contemplated by the
   merger agreement and (3) using all reasonable efforts to lift any
   restraint, injunction or other legal bar to the merger;

  . take all action necessary to call, give notice of and hold a meeting of
    its stockholders to vote on a proposal to adopt the merger agreement; and

  . use its best efforts to ensure that (1) its operating expenses for the
    first fiscal quarter of 2001 will not exceed $11.5 million in the
    aggregate as of March 31, 2001 and (2) its operating expenses will not
    exceed $3.8 million per month for each month ended on January 31, 2001
    and February 28, 2001, respectively. The term "operating expenses" is
    defined in the merger agreement as the sum of sales and marketing
    expenses, research and development expenses and general and
    administrative expenses of Prime Response computed on a consolidated
    basis and in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles
    applied on a consistent basis; provided, however, such sum shall not
    include (A) non-cash expenses incurred by Prime Response during the first
    fiscal quarter of 2001, (B) expenses incurred by Prime Response in
    connection with the merger agreement and (C) non-recurring expenses
    related to actions taken by Prime Response in connection with the
    corporate restructuring of Prime Response after the date of the merger
    agreement provided that and only if Chordiant shall have consented to all
    of such actions and the resulting non-recurring expenses.

   Prime Response has also agreed that its board of directors will recommend
that the Prime Response stockholders vote to adopt the merger agreement.
However, at any time before the Prime Response special meeting, Prime
Response's board of directors is entitled to withdraw or modify its
recommendation that the Prime Response stockholders vote to adopt the merger
agreement if the following are satisfied:

  . an unsolicited, bona fide written offer to purchase all of the
    outstanding shares of Prime Response common stock is made to Prime
    Response and is not withdrawn;

  . Prime Response provides Chordiant with reasonable prior notice of any
    meeting of Prime Response's board of directors at which Prime Response's
    board of directors will determine whether such an offer constitutes a
    superior offer as defined below;

  . Prime Response's board of directors determines in good faith (based upon
    the advice of an independent financial advisor of nationally recognized
    reputation) that the offer constitutes a superior offer;

  . Prime Response's board of directors determines in good faith, after
    having taken into account the advice of Prime Response's outside legal
    counsel, that, in light of the superior offer, the withdrawal or
    modification of its recommendation is required for the board of directors
    to comply with its fiduciary obligations to the Prime Response
    stockholders under applicable law;

  . the Prime Response board recommendation that the Prime Response
    stockholders vote to approve the merger agreement is not withdrawn or
    modified in a manner adverse to Chordiant at any time within five
    business days after Chordiant receives written notice from Prime Response
    confirming that Prime Response's board of directors has determined that
    the offer constitutes a superior offer; and

  . neither Prime Response nor any of its representatives has breached or
    taken any action inconsistent with the agreement not to solicit or
    encourage, or participate in discussions or negotiations with respect to,
    acquisition proposals from or with parties other than Chordiant.

   For purposes of the merger agreement, the term "superior offer" means an
unsolicited, bona fide written offer made by a third party to purchase all of
the outstanding shares of Prime Response common stock on terms that the Prime
Response board of directors determines, in its reasonable judgment, based upon
the advice of an independent financial advisor of nationally recognized
reputation, to be more favorable to the Prime Response stockholders than the
terms of the merger agreement. Such an offer shall not, however, be deemed to
be a superior offer if any financing required to consummate the transaction
contemplated by the offer is not committed and is not reasonably capable of
being obtained by the third party.

   Prime Response's obligation to call, give notice of and hold the special
stockholders' meeting will not be affected by the commencement, disclosure,
announcement or submission of a superior offer or acquisition proposal, or by
any withdrawal or modification of the recommendation by Prime Response's board
of directors that Prime Response's stockholders vote to approve the merger
agreement.

   If the Prime Response board of directors withdraws or modifies its
recommendation that the Prime Response stockholders vote to approve the merger
agreement, Prime Response may be required to pay Chordiant a nonrefundable fee
in the amount of $1.0 million, plus reimbursement for expenses incurred by
Chordiant in connection with the merger up to $2.0 million (including attorney
fees, accountants fees, financial advisory fees and filing fees). See "Certain
Terms of the Merger Agreement--Expenses and Termination Fee."

   Negative Covenants of Prime Response. Prime Response has agreed that before
the effective time of the merger, without the prior written consent of
Chordiant, it will not, will not agree to, will not commit to and will not
permit its subsidiaries to:

  . declare, accrue, set aside or pay any dividend or make any other
    distribution in respect of any shares of capital stock, or repurchase,
    redeem or otherwise reacquire any shares of capital stock or other
    securities;

  . subject to specified exceptions, including the issuance of shares of
    Prime Response common stock upon the valid exercise of Prime Response
    options or warrants outstanding as of the date of the merger agreement,
    sell, issue, grant or authorize the issuance or grant of any capital
    stock or other security, any option, call, warrant or right to acquire
    any capital stock or other security or any instrument convertible into or
    exchangeable for any capital stock or other security;

  . amend or waive any of its rights under, or accelerate the vesting under,
    any provision of any of Prime Response's stock option plans, any
    provision of any agreement evidencing any outstanding stock option or any
    restricted stock purchase agreement, or otherwise modify the terms of any
    outstanding option, warrant or other security or related contract;

  . amend or permit the adoption of any amendment to its certificate of
    incorporation or bylaws or other charter or organizational documents;

  . effect or become a party to any merger, consolidation, share exchange,
    business combination, amalgamation, recapitalization, reclassification of
    shares, stock split, reverse stock split, division or subdivision of
    shares, consolidation of shares or similar transaction;

  . subject to specified exceptions, form any subsidiary or acquire any
    equity interest in any other entity;

  . make any capital expenditure;

  . enter into or become bound by, or permit any of the assets owned or used
    by Prime Response to become bound by, any contract (including, without
    limitation, any contract requiring Prime Response or any of its
    subsidiaries to license, sell or otherwise make available to any person
    any product, system or software, any contract with respect to the lease
    of real property and any contract with or relating to any employee), or
    amend or terminate, or waive or exercise any right or remedy under, any
    contract;

  . lend money to any person, forgive any indebtedness or incur or guarantee
    any indebtedness;

  . establish, adopt or amend any employee benefit plan, pay any bonus or
    make any profit-sharing payment to, or increase the amount of the wages,
    salary, commissions, fringe benefits or other compensation payable to,
    any of its directors, officers or employees;

  . hire or promote any employee or engage any consultant or independent
    contractor;

  . change any of its product return policies, personnel policies or any of
    its methods of accounting or accounting practices in any respect;

  . make any tax election;

  . commence or settle any legal proceeding;

  . enter into any material transaction or take any other material action; or

  . make any disclosure regarding the merger or any of the other transactions
    contemplated by the merger agreement unless Chordiant shall have approved
    such disclosure or Prime Response shall have been advised in writing by
    its outside legal counsel that such disclosure is required by applicable
    law.

   Affirmative Covenants of Chordiant. Chordiant has agreed that, until the
earlier of the effective time of the merger or the termination of the merger
agreement, it will, among other things, and subject to specified exceptions:

  . provide Prime Response with reasonable access to Chordiant's personnel,
    assets, books, records, tax returns and other documents and information
    and provide Prime Response with copies of existing books, records, tax
    returns and other documents and information relating to Chordiant and to
    such additional financial, operating and other data and information
    regarding Chordiant as Prime Response may reasonably request;

  . register under the Securities Act the issuance of the shares of Chordiant
    common stock in the merger;

  . use all reasonable efforts to file all notices, reports and other
    documents required to be filed with any governmental body with respect to
    the merger and the other transactions contemplated by the merger
    agreement, including the notifications required under the HSR Act and any
    applicable foreign, federal and state antitrust laws or regulations in
    connection with the merger and to submit promptly any additional
    information requested by any such governmental body;

  . use all commercially reasonable efforts to take, or cause to be taken,
    all actions necessary to consummate the merger and make effective the
    other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, including (1)
    making all filings, if any, and giving all notices, if any, required to
    be made and given by Chordiant in connection with the merger and the
    other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, (2) using all
    reasonable efforts to obtain each consent, if any, required to be
    obtained by Chordiant in connection with the merger or any of the other
    transactions contemplated by the merger agreement and (3) using all
    reasonable efforts to lift any restraint, injunction or other legal bar
    to the merger;

  . take all action necessary to call, give notice of and hold a meeting of
    its stockholders to vote on a proposal to approve the issuance of shares
    of Chordiant common stock in the merger; and

  . use all commercially reasonable efforts to cause the board of directors
    of Chordiant to consist, as of the effective time of the merger, of ten
    directors: (1) nine of whom will be persons designated by Chordiant, and
    (2) one of whom will be a person designated by Prime Response, provided
    that person is not an employee of Prime Response or any of its
    subsidiaries.

   Chordiant has also agreed that its board of directors will recommend that
the Chordiant stockholders vote to approve the issuance of shares of Chordiant
common stock in the merger. However, notwithstanding the foregoing, at any time
before the Chordiant special meeting, the Chordiant board of directors is
entitled to withdraw or modify its recommendation that the Chordiant
stockholders vote to approve the issuance of shares of Chordiant common stock
in the merger if the board of directors of Chordiant concludes in good faith,
after having taken into account the advice of Chordiant's outside legal
counsel, that the withdrawal or modification of the board of directors'
recommendation is required in order for the board of directors of Chordiant to
comply with its fiduciary obligations to Chordiant's stockholders under
applicable law. No termination fee will be payable to Prime Response by
Chordiant if the board of directors of Chordiant withdraws or modifies its
recommendation that the Chordiant stockholders vote to approve the issuance of
shares of Chordiant common stock in the merger.

   Negative Covenants of Chordiant. Chordiant has agreed that before the
effective time of the merger, without the prior written consent of Prime
Response, it will not make any disclosure regarding the merger or any of the
other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement unless Prime Response
shall have approved such disclosure or Chordiant shall have been advised in
writing by its outside legal counsel that such disclosure is required by
applicable law.

Limitation on Prime Response's Ability to Consider other Acquisition Proposals

   Prime Response has agreed that it will not directly or indirectly, and that
it will not authorize or permit its subsidiaries or any of its representatives
directly or indirectly, to:

  . solicit, initiate, encourage, induce or facilitate the making, submission
    or announcement of any acquisition proposal or take any action that could
    reasonably be expected to lead to an acquisition proposal, as defined
    below;

  . furnish any information regarding Prime Response or any of its
    subsidiaries to any person in connection with or in response to an
    acquisition proposal or an inquiry or indication of interest that could
    lead to an acquisition proposal;

  . engage in discussions or negotiations with any person with respect to any
    acquisition proposal;

  . approve, endorse or recommend any acquisition proposal; or

  . enter into any letter of intent or similar document or any contract
    contemplating or otherwise relating to any acquisition transaction, as
    defined below.

   For purposes of the merger agreement, the term "acquisition proposal" means
any offer, proposal, inquiry or indication of interest, other than by
Chordiant, contemplating or otherwise relating to any acquisition transaction.

   For purposes of the merger agreement, the term "acquisition transaction"
means:

  . any merger, consolidation, amalgamation, share exchange, business
    combination, issuance of securities, acquisition of securities, tender
    offer, exchange offer or other similar transaction (1) in which Prime
    Response or any its subsidiaries is a constituent corporation, (2) in
    which a person or group of persons directly or indirectly acquires
    beneficial or record ownership of securities representing more than 20%
    of the outstanding securities of any class of voting securities of Prime
    Response or its subsidiaries or (3) in which Prime Response or any of its
    subsidiaries issues securities representing more than 20% of the
    outstanding securities of any class of voting securities of Prime
    Response or any of its subsidiaries;

  . any sale, lease, exchange, transfer, license, acquisition or disposition
    of any business or businesses or assets that constitute or account for
    20% or more of the consolidated net revenues, net income or assets of
    Prime Response or any of its subsidiaries; or

  . any liquidation or dissolution of Prime Response or any of its
    subsidiaries.

   However, prior to the adoption of the merger agreement by the Prime Response
stockholders, these restrictions will not prohibit Prime Response from
furnishing nonpublic information regarding Prime Response or its subsidiaries
to, or entering into discussions with, any person or entity in response to a
superior offer (as defined above) that is submitted to Prime Response by that
person or entity (and not withdrawn) if:

  . neither Prime Response nor any representative of Prime Response or any
    its subsidiaries have breached or taken any action inconsistent with the
    restrictions discussed above;

  . the Prime Response board of directors determines in good faith, based
    upon the advice of an independent financial advisor of nationally
    recognized reputation, that such acquisition proposal is reasonably
    likely to lead to a superior offer;

  . the board of directors of Prime Response concludes in good faith, after
    having taken into account the advice of its outside legal counsel, that
    such action is required in order for the board of directors to comply
    with its fiduciary obligations to the Prime Response stockholders under
    applicable law;

  . prior to furnishing any such nonpublic information to, or entering into
    discussions with, that person, Prime Response gives Chordiant written
    notice of the identity of that person and of Prime Response's intention
    to furnish nonpublic information to, or enter into discussions with, that
    person, and Prime Response receives from that person an executed
    confidentiality agreement containing customary limitations on the use and
    disclosure of all nonpublic written and oral information furnished to
    that person by or on behalf of Prime Response and containing customary
    "standstill" provisions; and

  . prior to furnishing any such nonpublic information to that person, Prime
    Response furnishes such nonpublic information to Chordiant, to the extent
    such nonpublic information has not been previously furnished by Prime
    Response to Chordiant.

   If the Prime Response board of directors receives an acquisition proposal,
any inquiry or indication of interest that could reasonably be expected to lead
to an acquisition proposal or any request for nonpublic information then Prime
Response must, within 24 hours of receipt of such acquisition proposal,
inquiry, indication of interest or request, advise Chordiant orally and in
writing of such matter (including the identity of the person making or
submitting such acquisition proposal, inquiry, indication of interest or
request, and the terms thereof). Prime Response must keep Chordiant fully
informed with respect to the status of any such acquisition proposal, inquiry,
indication of interest or request and any modification or proposed modification
to the acquisition proposal. Prime Response must immediately cease and cause to
be terminated any existing discussions with any person that relate to any
acquisition proposal.

   Prime Response has agreed not to release or permit the release of any person
from, or to waive or permit the waiver of any provision of, any
confidentiality, "standstill," or similar agreement to which Prime Response or
any of its subsidiaries is a party or under which Prime Response or any of its
subsidiaries has any rights, and will use its best efforts to enforce or cause
to be enforced each of these agreements at the request of Chordiant. Prime
Response has also agreed to promptly request that each person who has executed,
within 12 months prior to the date of the merger agreement, a confidentiality
agreement in connection with its consideration of a possible acquisition
transaction or equity investment to return all confidential information
furnished to that person by or on behalf of Prime Response or any of its
subsidiaries.

Conditions to the Merger

   Conditions to the Obligations of Each Party. The obligations of Chordiant
and Prime Response to complete the merger and otherwise consummate the
transactions contemplated by the merger agreement are subject to the
satisfaction, at or prior to the closing of the merger, of the following
conditions:

  . the registration statement of which this joint proxy statement/prospectus
    is a part shall have become effective in accordance with the provisions

  . Chordiant shall have received assurances reasonably satisfactory to it
    that Prime Response has not exercised any rights it may have either in
    whole or in part to purchase shares of MarketSwitch Corporation pursuant
    to a warrant, dated March 31, 2000, entered into by Prime Response and
    MarketSwitch Corporation.

   As used in the merger agreement, "material adverse effect" means with
respect to Prime Response and its subsidiaries, any change, effect, event,
occurrence, state of facts or development that has had or could reasonably be
expected to have a material adverse effect on (i) the business, financial
condition or results of operations of Prime Response and its subsidiaries taken
as a whole, (ii) the ability of Prime Response to consummate the merger or any
of the other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement or to perform
any of its obligations under the merger agreement, or (iii) Chordiant's ability
to vote, receive dividends with respect to or otherwise exercise ownership
rights with respect to the stock of the surviving corporation. However, none of
the following, in and of itself, will constitute a material adverse effect on
Prime Response and its subsidiaries:

  . a change in the market price or trading volume of Prime Response's common
    stock;

  . any adverse change, effect, event, occurrence, state of facts or
    development attributable to conditions affecting the industries in which
    Prime Response participates, the United States economy as a whole or
    foreign economies in any locations where Prime Response or any of its
    subsidiaries has material operations or sales, so long as such conditions
    do not affect Prime Response or any of its subsidiaries in a materially
    disproportionate manner;

  . any failure by Prime Response to meet internal projections or forecasts,
    analysts' expectations or published revenue or earnings predictions for
    any period ending (or for which revenues or earnings are released) on or
    after the date of the merger agreement; and

  . any adverse change, effect, event, occurrence, state of facts or
    development resulting from or relating to entering into, compliance with
    the terms of, or the taking of any action required by the merger
    agreement.

   Conditions to the Obligation of Prime Response. The obligation of Prime
Response to effect the merger and otherwise consummate the transactions
contemplated by the merger agreement are subject to the satisfaction, at or
prior to the closing, of the following additional conditions:

  . the representations and warranties made by Chordiant in the merger
    agreement shall have been accurate in all material respects as of the
    date of the merger agreement (except for representations and warranties
    which address matters only as of a particular time, which shall have been
    accurate in all material respects as of that particular time); provided
    that for the purposes of determining the accuracy of such representations
    and warranties, all "material adverse effect" qualifications and other
    materiality qualifications and any update or modification to Chordiant's
    disclosure schedule made after the date of the merger agreement will be
    disregarded;

  . representations and warranties made by Chordiant relating to certain
    corporate governance and other related matters such as Chordiant's
    corporate structure, corporate standing and capitalization shall be
    accurate in all respects as of the date the merger is completed as if
    made on such date (except for representations and warranties which
    address matters only as of a particular time, which shall have been
    accurate in all respects as of that particular time); provided that for
    the purposes of determining the accuracy of such representations and
    warranties all "material adverse effect" qualifications and other
    materiality qualifications and any update or modification to Chordiant's
    disclosure schedule related to such representations and warranties will
    be disregarded. Any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties
    will be disregarded if the circumstances giving rise to all inaccuracies
    considered collectively do not constitute, and would not reasonably be
    expected to have a material adverse effect on Chordiant and its
    subsidiaries;

  . Chordiant shall have complied with and performed in all material respects
    with all of its covenants and obligations in the merger agreement
    required to be complied with at or prior to the completion of the merger;
    and

  . Prime Response shall have received the following agreements and
    documents, each of which will be in full force and effect: (1) a legal
    opinion of Prime Response's outside legal counsel dated as of the closing
    date and addressed to Prime Response, to the effect that the merger will
    constitute a tax-free reorganization for United States federal income tax
    purposes; and (2) a certificate executed by any executive officer of
    Chordiant confirming that certain closing conditions have been satisfied.

   As used in the merger agreement, "material adverse effect" means with
respect to Chordiant, any change, effect, event, occurrence, state of facts or
development that has had or could reasonably be expected to have a material
adverse effect on (i) the business, financial condition or results of
operations of Chordiant and its subsidiaries taken as a whole or (ii) the
ability of Chordiant to consummate the merger or any of the other transactions
contemplated by the merger agreement or to perform any of its obligations under
the merger agreement. However, none of the following, in and of itself, will
constitute a material adverse effect on Chordiant:

  . a change in the market price or trading volume of Chordiant's common
    stock;

  . any adverse change, effect, event, occurrence, state of facts or
    development attributable to conditions affecting the industries in which
    Chordiant or any of its subsidiaries participates, the United States
    economy as a whole or foreign economies in any locations where Chordiant
    or any of its subsidiaries has material operations or sales, so long as
    such conditions do not affect Chordiant or any of its subsidiaries in a
    materially disproportionate manner;

  . any failure by Chordiant to meet internal projections or forecasts,
    analysts' expectations or published revenue or earnings predictions for
    any period ending (or for which revenues or earnings are released) on or
    after the date of the merger agreement; and

  . any adverse change, effect, event, occurrence, state of facts or
    development resulting from or relating to entering into, compliance with
    the terms of, or the taking of any action required by the merger
    agreement.

Termination of the Merger Agreement

   Chordiant and Prime Response can agree by mutual written consent to
terminate the merger agreement at any time before the completion of the merger.
In addition, either Chordiant or Prime Response may terminate the merger
agreement if:

  . the merger is not completed on or before June 30, 2001, unless the
    failure to consummate the merger is attributable to a failure on the part
    of the party seeking to terminate the merger agreement to perform any
    covenant required to be performed by such party on or prior to the
    completion of the merger;

  . a court or other governmental body issues a final and nonappealable order
    permanently restraining, enjoining or otherwise prohibiting the merger;

  . the Prime Response stockholders fail to adopt the merger agreement;

  . the Chordiant stockholders fail to approve the issuance of shares of
    Chordiant common stock in the merger; or

  . the representations and warranties of the other party in the merger
    agreement are or become inaccurate, or the other party breaches its
    covenants, such that a condition to the obligation of the party to which
    such representations and warranties or covenants relate would not be
    satisfied and the inaccuracy or breach is not curable through the
    exercise of reasonable efforts or the other party is not using reasonable
    efforts to cure the breach.

   In addition, Chordiant may terminate the merger agreement, before the
receipt of the Prime Response stockholder approval, if any of the following
"triggering events" occurs:

  . the Prime Response board of directors fails to recommend that the Prime
    Response stockholders vote to adopt the merger agreement, or has taken
    any other action which is reasonably determined by Chordiant to indicate
    that the board of directors of Prime Response might withdraw or modify
    such recommendation;

  . the board of directors of Prime Response takes any action that is
    inconsistent with supporting the merger or making its recommendation that
    the Prime Response stockholders vote to adopt the merger agreement;

  . Prime Response fails to include in this joint proxy statement/prospectus
    the recommendation by the Prime Response board of directors that the
    Prime Response stockholders vote to adopt the merger agreement or a
    statement to the effect that the Prime Response board of directors has
    determined and believes that the merger is in the best interests of the
    Prime Response stockholders;

  . the Prime Response board of directors fails to reaffirm its
    recommendation that the Prime Response stockholders vote to adopt the
    merger agreement or its determination that the merger is in the best
    interests of the Prime Response stockholders within five business days
    after Chordiant requests in writing that such recommendation or
    determination be reaffirmed;

  . the Prime Response board of directors approves, endorses or recommends
    another acquisition proposal;

  . Prime Response enters into a letter of intent or similar document or any
    contract contemplating another acquisition proposal;

  . Prime Response fails to hold the special meeting of the Prime Response
    stockholders within 45 days after the registration statement which
    includes this joint proxy statement/prospectus is declared effective;

  . a tender or exchange offer relating to securities of Prime Response is
    commenced, and Prime Response does not send to its securityholders,
    within 10 business days after the commencement of the tender or exchange
    offer, a statement disclosing that Prime Response recommends rejection of
    the tender or exchange offer;

  . another acquisition proposal is publicly announced and Prime Response
    fails to issue a press release announcing its opposition to the
    acquisition proposal within five business days after the acquisition
    proposal is announced or otherwise fails to actively oppose such
    acquisition proposal; or

  . Prime Response, its subsidiaries or any of their respective
    representatives breaches or takes any action inconsistent with its
    agreement not to solicit or encourage, or participate in discussions or
    negotiations with respect to, acquisition proposals from or with parties
    other than Chordiant.

   Subject to certain limited exceptions, if the merger agreement is
terminated, then it will be of no further effect, there will be no liability on
the part of Chordiant or Prime Response to the other, and all rights and
obligations of the parties will cease. However, no party will be relieved from
its obligations with respect to any material breach of representation, warranty
or covenant contained in the merger agreement.

Expenses and Termination Fee

 Expenses

   The merger agreement provides that, regardless of whether Chordiant and
Prime Response consummate the merger, each of Prime Response and Chordiant will
pay its own fees and expenses incurred in connection with the merger agreement
and the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, except that
Chordiant and Prime Response have agreed to share equally all fees and
expenses, other than attorneys' fees, incurred in connection with (1) the
filing, printing and mailing of this joint proxy statement/prospectus and any
amendments or supplements to this joint proxy statement/prospectus and (2) the
filing by the parties of the premerger notification and report forms relating
to the merger under the HSR Act and the filing of any notice or other document
under any applicable foreign antitrust law or regulation.

   However, not withstanding the foregoing, if the merger agreement is
terminated by Chordiant or Prime Response because the merger has not been
consummated by June 30, 2001 or the Prime Response stockholders have failed to
adopt the merger agreement at the special meeting of Prime Response
stockholders and at or prior to the time of the termination of the merger
agreement in both these circumstances, an acquisition proposal shall have been
disclosed, announced, commenced, submitted or made or the merger agreement is
terminated by Chordiant because one of the "triggering events" discussed above
occurs, the merger agreement requires Prime Response to reimburse Chordiant for
expenses incurred in connection with the merger up to $2.0 million (including
attorneys' fees, accountants fees, financial advisory fees and filing fees).

 Termination Fees

   If the merger agreement is terminated by Chordiant or Prime Response because
the merger is not consummated by June 30, 2001 or because the Prime Response
stockholders failed to adopt the merger agreement at the special meeting of
Prime Response stockholders and at or prior to the time of the termination of
the merger agreement in both these circumstances, an acquisition proposal shall
have been disclosed, announced, commenced, submitted or made or the merger
agreement is terminated by Chordiant because one the "triggering events"
described above occurs, the merger agreement requires Prime Response to pay
Chordiant a termination fee in the amount of $1.0 million.

Amendment

   The merger agreement may be amended by the approval of the Chordiant board
of directors and the Prime Response board of directors. However, after the
adoption of the merger agreement by Prime Response's stockholders, no amendment
which by law requires the approval of Prime Response's stockholders will be
effective until approved by Prime Response's stockholders and after Chordiant's
stockholders have approved the issuance of shares of Chordiant common stock in
the merger, no amendment which by law or National Association of Securities
Dealers, Inc. regulation requires further approval of Chordiant's stockholders
will be effective until approved by Chordiant's stockholders.

                               VOTING AGREEMENTS

   The following description of the voting agreements entered into by the
affiliated entities of the principal stockholder of Prime Response in favor of
Chordiant sets forth certain material terms of the voting agreements. The form
of voting agreement is attached as Annex B to this joint proxy

vote a certain percentage of the shares of Prime Response common stock owned by
them in favor of the adoption of the merger agreement, against competing
acquisition proposals, and otherwise as provided in the voting agreements. The
voting agreements also provide that they must vote against the following "other
actions," other than the merger: (1) any action or agreement that could result
in a breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or obligation of Prime
Response in the merger agreement or in the voting agreement; (2) any
extraordinary corporate transaction, such as a merger, consolidation or other
business combination involving Prime Response or any of its subsidiaries; (3)
any sale, lease or transfer of a material amount of assets of Prime Response or
any of its subsidiaries (other than in the ordinary course of business); (4)

proxy to vote a certain number of their shares of Prime Response common stock

proposals and in the discretion of the proxy holder with respect to the other
matters covered by the agreements. As of the record date, affiliated entities
of General Atlantic Partners, LLC collectively beneficially owned 9,269,217
shares of Prime Response common stock and have agreed to vote 8,192,828 shares
of Prime Response common stock beneficially owned by them (or approximately 40%
of the outstanding shares of Prime Response common stock as of the record date)
in favor of adoption of the merger agreement. The affiliated entities of
General Atlantic Partners, LLC may vote their shares of Prime Response common
stock on all matters not covered by the voting agreements.

   The affiliated entities of General Atlantic Partners, LLC who signed the
voting agreements also have agreed not to transfer any shares of Prime Response

the merger agreement or the consummation of the merger.

   These voting agreements will terminate upon the earlier to occur of the
valid termination of the merger agreement or the consummation of the merger,
unless an "identified termination" occurs, which includes circumstances where
the merger agreement is terminated by Chordiant or Prime Response because the
merger was not consummated by June 30, 2001 and at or prior to the time of
termination of the merger agreement an acquisition proposal had been disclosed,
announced, commenced, submitted or made, the merger agreement is terminated by
Prime Response or Chordiant because the Prime Response stockholders have failed
to approve the proposal to adopt the merger agreement or the merger agreement
is terminated by Chordiant because a "triggering event" as discussed above has
occurred. If an identified termination occurs, the Prime Response stockholders
who signed voting agreements have agreed that for a period of 180 days after
the merger agreement is validly terminated they will vote against any
acquisition proposal (not brought by Chordiant) and against the approval or
adoption of any related transaction or agreement, against any action that is
intended, or could reasonably be expected, to facilitate the consummation of
any other acquisition transaction and against any "other action" as defined
above.

                       INFORMATION RELATING TO CHORDIANT

                              CHORDIANT'S BUSINESS

Overview

   Chordiant provides a customer relationship management (CRM) software
infrastructure solution for customer relationship marketing, service, sales,
knowledge management and real-time transactions across multiple communication
channels. Chordiant believes its solution enables companies, who depend upon
and value their customer relationships, to bolster customer retention and build
long-term, profitable relationships with customers. Chordiant's primary target
markets include companies with the most demanding customer relationships
involving a large number of individual customers with complex customer
relationships that require high levels of personalized services. Chordiant's
customers include global companies in the financial services,
telecommunications, retail and integrated travel services industries. The
Chordiant solution seeks to fulfill the requirements these companies have for
an enterprise-wide CRM software infrastructure solution capable of servicing
millions of individual customers across multiple communication channels in
real-time.

Industry Background

   The CRM market is large, pervasive and rapidly growing. Today, Chordiant
believes customers are placing increasing value on convenient access to
information, products and services. To be successful in building long term and
profitable relationships with customers, Chordiant believes companies must take
a strategic approach to attract and retain valuable customers. To attract
customers, companies must focus on developing and executing a new set of
strategies that provide users with personalized experiences when they first
contact a company. Companies must be more responsive to customer needs and must
focus on delivering superior customer service and satisfaction to differentiate
themselves from their competitors. Companies must work to retain their
customers by providing relevant and targeted information and experiences each
time an interaction between a business and individual takes place. Moreover,
companies must recognize that every customer interaction provides an
opportunity to sell additional, and more valuable, products and services and
increase customer loyalty through personalized customer interaction.

   While the Internet has emerged as a significant channel to initiate and
maintain customer relationships, Chordiant believes that existing and
established customer communication channels have not become less significant.
Specifically, to remain competitive, Chordiant believes that companies must
provide consistent high quality customer service across all communication
channels including self service systems such as the Internet, e-mail and
automated telephony and assisted contact points such as call centers, branches
and retail outlets. Companies that use organization and enterprise-wide
customer information to provide consistent customer services through
interactions across multiple channels and contact points will be able to
compete more successfully in the rapidly changing Internet economy.

   There are many challenges to implementing an enterprise approach that is
focused on individual customers. These challenges include providing customers
access to information and functionality that traditionally resides within
complex back end systems, integrating and managing disparate systems and
generating relevant processes in real time. Successful integration of these
systems and the creation of a comprehensive single view of the customer allows
companies to control routing and prompting of appropriate responses to the
customer in an automated and dynamic process.

   Many existing product technologies do not meet the new requirements of an
enterprise view of customer relationships. Client/server technologies for sales
force automation, call centers and field service management were originally
designed for departmental functions and use by employees rather than customers.
The growth of the Internet has given rise to a wide range of new products
focused on a specific channel of customer contact such as Web self-service, e-
mail response and marketing automation. These single function Web-based
products are not likely to completely replace existing means of handling
customer service and commerce. For instance, many companies continue to rely
heavily on telephone-based customer service representatives and are struggling
to integrate Web and e-mail products with the telephone. Companies have
responded to the lack of

integration among existing products by attempting to design and build their own
e-business software applications. The cost and time to custom build these new
systems can be prohibitive, and the expertise required to design and integrate
the systems are often beyond the capabilities of most companies. Additionally,
most commercially-available and custom-built systems do not have the
flexibility to integrate existing and anticipated technologies or to allow
customization to keep up with a constantly changing Internet economy.

   Chordiant believes that companies need a flexible, integrated software
solution that supports all channels of customer contact with a comprehensive
single view of the customer and consistent business services. Today, customer
data must be accessed from multiple sources, applications and transaction
systems to respond to customer inquiries following company specific business
rules. Unlike traditional customer profiles, a comprehensive single view of the
customer must be updated in real time for each customer contact and reflect the
customer's contact history and other relevant information. A completely
customer focused software solution improves the ability to attract, engage and
retain customers on a personalized basis and understand their needs and
preferences to provide consistent interactions with customers through any
communication channel.

management technology helps companies develop a single view of the customer by
integrating, consolidating and managing data derived from external and internal
sources. Chordiant's product suite uses multiple data sources, existing
applications and transaction systems to build a comprehensive single view of
the customer and generate the appropriate response at time of contact. A bank,
for example, might use Chordiant's products to integrate information about

a customer contained in internal databases such as credit card, mortgage and
savings account historical transaction systems, Web logs and e-mail management
systems, as well as external databases such as national credit check services.
By integrating this information, the bank has a more comprehensive
understanding of the customer's ability to repay a loan and the value of that
customer's relationship with the bank.

   Automated, sophisticated decision making processes. Workflow and rules
driven business processes help companies to make automated, yet informed,
decisions about customer inquiries. Chordiant's workflow processing system
supports customizable business processes allowing companies to develop business
rules that will be implemented consistently. Chordiant's workflow editor is a
graphical user interface application that allows business analysts to customize
and automate their company's unique business rules. Chordiant's sophisticated
routing engine is designed to allow companies to instantly determine how to
respond to specific customer inquiries and generate offers appropriate for
particular customers. A bank, for example, could specify that at the time of
contact, only customers with a solid credit card history, an existing home
loan, a savings account with a minimum balance and a clean credit history
should receive an attractive auto loan rate and free online bill payment
services.

   Consistent customer experience across multiple channels. Chordiant believes
that companies providing customers with a consistent experience across multiple
communication channels enjoy greater customer satisfaction because customers
are able to receive the same reliable service and information regardless of how
they choose to contact the company. There are a large and increasing number of
customer communications channels, including: Web, e-mail, fax, self-service
systems, mobile devices, call centers and retail outlets. Chordiant's product
suite implements a common set of business rules uniformly across systems
already existing in different customer communications channels. A bank, for
example, could ensure that a particular customer receives the same attractive
auto loan rate and online bill payment service promotion, regardless of whether
the customer contacts the bank through the Web, e-mail, a customer service call
center or in person at a local branch.

   Standard and customizable business services. Chordiant believes that
companies that implement their unique business services will realize greater
levels of efficiency, consistency and customer satisfaction. Chordiant's
products provide a broad set of standard business objects, or fundamental
business functions, that are common across industries. These standard business
objects can be modified to accommodate specific customer and business
processes, policies and transactions of individual companies. A bank, for
example, could customize Chordiant's business objects by activating specific
financial services objects related to specific transactions, such as processing
auto loans, and alter Chordiant's standard loan business processes to bypass an
external credit check if the customer has a clean credit and mortgage history.

Strategy

   Chordiant's objective is to continue to provide innovative CRM
infrastructure software that enables companies to provide superior relationship
marketing, personalized service and customer support to their individual
customers across multiple communication channels.

   Key elements of Chordiant's strategy include the following:

   Continue technology leadership. The increasing demands for multi-channel
interactive CRM solutions require products that are adaptable, extensible and
interoperable. To meet these requirements, Chordiant intends to continue to
devote substantial resources to the development of new and innovative product
capabilities. Because Chordiant has designed its products to utilize the
capabilities of the Internet, Chordiant believes that its products are more
easily adapted to a constantly changing, e-business environment. For example,
Chordiant's product suite is designed to accommodate additional contact points
such as personal digital assistants, cellular telephones and digital
television.

   Extend technology and integration alliances. Chordiant has sought, secured
and continued to seek, strategic alliances to assist in developing, marketing
and selling its product. This approach is intended to

leverage the technology and resources available to perform application design
and development services for Chordiant's customers and provide additional
marketing and technical expertise in industry segments. To help ensure that
Chordiant delivers comprehensive products to its customers, Chordiant has
established strategic relationships with organizations in three general
categories:

  . computing and network platform vendors;

  . software platform vendors; and

  . systems integrators.

   Target leading global business-to-consumer companies. Chordiant intends to
continue targeting the global leaders in the primary business-to-consumer
markets by providing solutions to the financial services, telecommunications,
travel and retail industries. These industries are characterized by commodity-
like products and large numbers of dispersed customers, partners, vendors and
suppliers. Chordiant believes that companies in these industries will be early
users, and early beneficiaries, of an integrated system that can deliver
personalized, real-time processes utilizing a comprehensive single view of the
customer.

   Expand worldwide infrastructure. Chordiant intends to continue to grow its
global presence by expanding worldwide field sales, marketing and services
organizations. Chordiant plans to continue expanding its international presence
by adding direct sales personnel and increasing Chordiant's indirect sales
channels. In particular, Chordiant plans to further expand its European
operations from Chordiant's existing international headquarters in London,
England. Chordiant has established regional offices in both Germany and the
Netherlands.

   Growth through customer references. Chordiant plans to achieve additional
market success as Chordiant's customers become successful in using their e-
business initiatives to increase customer retention and revenues. Chordiant's
most successful customers become valuable references for Chordiant's future
sales opportunities. To ensure that all Chordiant customers become Chordiant
references, Chordiant intends to:

  . deliver superior customer service to Chordiant's customers, to help
    ensure their long-term satisfaction and success with Chordiant's
    products;

  . work with experienced and knowledgeable systems integrators to help
    enable Chordiant's customers to implement large scale deployments
    successfully;

  . deliver high quality customer education and training on Chordiant's
    products to assist Chordiant's customers to meet and exceed their e-
    business expectations; and

  . hire and retain expert consultants to assist Chordiant's customers in
    implementation of Chordiant's products.

Products

   Chordiant's products are designed to address complex and extreme customer
information demands placed on global companies who desire to treat millions of
their customers in an individual, personalized way. Chordiant's Unified CRM
Solution provides companies with e-business infrastructure software that is
typically licensed as an integrated set of applications and functionality.

   Chordiant's Unified CRM Solution suite is designed using a three-tiered
technology architecture. This layered architecture insulates software
components from one another which allows enhancements and customization to the
software to be made in a plug-and-play, modular manner. This three-tiered
product architecture is summarized below:

   The Chordiant Unified Infrastructure. The Chordiant Unified Infrastructure
brings together data from across the customer's enterprise to create the
customer data model. This customer data model provides a single point of
contact for customer transactions, affording efficient access to all customer
account information.

Chordiant's Unified Infrastructure integrates and communicates with telephony
equipment, legacy systems and transactional applications. The Chordiant Unified
Infrastructure enables workflow-driven interfaces and support for electronic
communications, telephony systems and switches, SQL relational databases, back-
office business applications and legacy data warehouses. As part of the Unified
Infrastructure, Chordiant has developed a unique set of technologies that
incorporate separate object-oriented communications managers for Internet,
e-mail, CTI and fax customer communications. Each communications manager is
responsible for representing the customer's request to the Chordiant workflow
engine.

   The Chordiant Unified Infrastructure also hosts persistent data connectors
and data routers, which manage communications between the Chordiant workflow
engine and a company's legacy applications, mainframe databases, relational
databases and data warehouses. The Chordiant Unified Infrastructure provides
integration capabilities with these legacy database systems and relational
databases, whether they reside locally or are dispersed across the corporate
enterprise network. Through the persistent data manager and data router,
Chordiant's Unified CRM Infrastructure opens, calls, encapsulates, updates and
manages data resources from one or more databases, providing the complete set
of data and information needed when interacting with a customer.

   Customers may also license Chordiant's Unified Rules and Unified Workflow
with Chordiant's Unified Infrastructure. Chordiant Unified Rules and Chordiant
Unified Workflow applications address functionality required by a customer
business analyst who incorporates their company's business processes into the
Chordiant Unified CRM Solution. The Unified Rules and Workflow allow for the
creation of new business processes or modify existing ones. By using Unified
Rules, processes can be strung together to provide a fully guided sequence for
complex business process, or a large number of dissimilar transactions or
services.

   Chordiant's Unified Touch-points. Chordiant's Unified Touch-points provide a
dynamic interface for creating unique, personalized interactions between the
business and individual. Individuals may contact companies through this layer
by browser-based HTML/XML, e-mail, fax, telephony and mobile devices. Internal
customer service representatives respond to each customer contact based upon
the business process, the company's policies for that process and the
customer's unique profile.

   Chordiant's Unified Response center. Chordiant's Unified Response center
includes three applications: Live Response, Assisted Response and Automated
Response. Live Response is the application used by customer service agents. The
Live Response application uses guided transactions to ensure that the customer
interaction is both personalized and consistent across all touch-points. Live
Response provides a customer interaction environment that empowers a customer
service agent to provide individualized high-quality sales, support and
service. Application functionality includes:

  . Customer Management (create, retrieve, update and delete customer
    information)

  . Account Management (view, add, delete, update)

  . Inquiries (directions, assistance)

  . Service Work (view queues, add activities, transfer work, defer work,
    view activities in process)

  . Local Administration (change password, modify screen layout)

   Chordiant's Assisted Response E-mail application routes incoming e-mail to a
queue for assisted response dependent upon on the e-mail content, the customer
profile, or the final results from the query to the Chordiant knowledge base
application. This approach provides a highly flexible way to manage the routing
of incoming messages dependent upon customer case history and profile.

   Chordiant's Automated Response E-mail application includes automated e-mail
routing and e-mail response capabilities. This application will receive
incoming e-mail and compare the e-mail to templates to determine if they should
be automatically responded to, or if the e-mail should be immediately forwarded
to a

customer service agent for assisted response. When the automated response
feature is enabled, the application will attempt to locate an answer from the
knowledge base application. If an appropriate answer is found, a return answer
to the customer (via e-mail) will be made and the event will be logged into the
customer's case history.

Customers

   Chordiant targets multinational market leaders in business-to-consumer
industries, particularly companies in the financial services,
telecommunications, travel and leisure and automotive industries. In the
future, Chordiant plans to expand into the retail and utilities industries.
Below is a list of Chordiant's customers as of December 31, 2000, each of which
during the past two years has purchased $500,000 or more of products from
Chordiant.

  . Bank One International

  . British Sky Broadcasting (BskyB)

  . Barclays Mercantile

  . Direct Line Group Services Limited

  . First USA Bank

  . OnStar, a division of General Motors, Inc.

  . Lloyds TSB Bank

  . Metropolitan Life Insurance Company

  . The Royal Bank of Scotland plc

   A small number of customers account for a significant portion of Chordiant's
total revenues. As a result, the loss or delay of individual orders or delays
in the product implementations for a customer can have a large impact on
Chordiant's revenues. In 1998, revenues from KLM Royal Dutch Airlines, Thomas
Cook Global Services, Canadian Tire Acceptance Limited and Chase Manhattan
Mortgage Corporation accounted for 36%, 19%, 14% and 12% of Chordiant's total
net revenues. In 1999, revenues from Chase Manhattan Mortgage Corporation and
First USA accounted for 30% and 19% of Chordiant's total net revenues. For the
year ended December 31, 2000, revenues from Electronic Data Systems
Corporation, Lloyds TSB and Direct Line Group Services Limited accounted for
approximately 30%, 19% and 14%, respectively of Chordiant's total net revenues.
Chordiant expects that revenues from a small number of customers will continue
to account for a majority of Chordiant's total net revenues in the future as
historical implementations are completed and replaced with new projects from
new and existing customers.

Technology

   Chordiant designs and builds products to provide customer relationship
management solutions for large enterprises. Chordiant's Unified CRM solution
product suite consists of three layers. These layers are: e-business software
infrastructure, e-business software application code and a software framework,
including several software engines.

   The first software-layer, the e-business infrastructure, utilizes a four-
tier architecture: (1) delivering functionality to desktop computers, (2)
multiple consumer touch points (Web, e-mail, fax, etc.), (3) corporate
computing centers, and (4) in the data centers and networks of the company. The
first-tier is used by internal customer service representatives, marketing
professionals, sales and service employees, supervisors, management and other
staff of a company involved with customer contact. The second-tier is for the
consumers who desire to interact with the company using telephones, Web
browsers or wireless personal digital assistants and mobile devices. Telephone
calls, e-mails, Web-collaboration and other interactions are managed by

Chordiant's technology in this second-tier. The third-tier of the architecture
configures and operates the multiple software servers in customer computing
centers. This third-tier queues, routes, responds, initiates and computes the
business processes and applications, based on distributed information and
processing of business logic. All customer data comes from the fourth-tier,
where existing corporate company information systems are accessed and data is
integrated with connector architecture including caching and transactions
capabilities. Underlying this architecture is a persistent data management
system that integrates multiple real time data sources, utilizing object-
computing models.

   The second software-layer, the Chordiant e-business application code,
implements a wide variety of common functions often used by retail, financial,
insurance, travel and telecommunications industries for customer relationship
management functions. A flexible object model consisting of common business
fundamentals is contained in this technology layer. For example, common objects
include establishing the initial customer relationship, taking customer orders,
opening accounts, accessing the customer's case history, fulfilling orders and
case tracking.

   The third software-layer contains Chordiant's enterprise software framework.
The framework itself implements workload balancing, fail over systems, data
management systems and security systems. The framework also includes several
software engines used by the first and second software-layers. These engines
include a workflow system, a business rules system and a knowledge management
system.

   Applications running in the context of this multi-layer, multi-tier
environment, along with the data management system, object model and the
software engines, assist in delivering distributed customer data throughout the
company to form a single and unified view of a customer.

   Certain Chordiant products use technology modules from third party
technology providers including Sun Microsystems, IBM and Ilog, Inc. Chordiant
products are based on open system standards and are designed to be scalable and
integrate with a company's various information technology systems, networks and
telephony systems. Chordiant's products are based on industry standards
including Java, CORBA, IIOP, RMI and XML. Chordiant's server software runs on
both UNIX server platforms and Windows NT servers and can be configured for
multiple servers.

Sales and Marketing

   Chordiant licenses its products and sells services primarily through a
direct sales organization which is complemented by the selling and support
efforts of systems integrators and technology vendors. Chordiant's market focus
is in the business-to-consumer segment of the economy with a targeted effort on
leading consumer focused companies and companies using multiple channels as the
means of conducting business and serving customers. Chordiant targets its sales
and marketing efforts, together with its product design efforts, on industries
such as retail banking, consumer financial services, telecommunications, travel
and leisure, automotive and retailers.

   The sales process generally ranges from three to twenty-four months
depending on the level of education that prospective customers need about the
use and benefits of Chordiant's products and the involvement of systems
integrators. During the sales process, Chordiant typically approaches senior
executive management teams including the senior marketing officer, chief
information officer and chief executive officer of the potential customer.
Chordiant utilizes sales teams consisting of sales and technical professionals
who work with Chordiant's strategic partners to create organization-specific
proposals, presentations and demonstrations that address the specific needs of
each potential customer.

   Chordiant has sales offices in the greater metropolitan areas of Dallas,
Chicago and New York, and in Cupertino, California, London, England, Munich,
Germany and Amsterdam, the Netherlands. Technical sales consultants provide
pre-sales support to potential customers on product information and deployment
capabilities and complement the direct sales professionals. Chordiant plans to
significantly expand the size of its direct sales organization and to establish
additional sales offices domestically and internationally.

   Chordiant focuses its marketing efforts on educating potential customers,
generating new sales opportunities and creating awareness of Chordiant's
products. Chordiant conducts a variety of marketing programs to educate its
target market, including seminars, trade shows, press relations and industry
analyst programs.

   Chordiant's marketing organization serves an integral role in acquiring,
organizing and prioritizing customer and industry feedback to help provide
product direction to its development organization. Chordiant also has a
detailed product management process that surveys customers and identifies
market needs to help predict and prioritize future customer requirements.

Professional Services, Customer Support and Education Services

   Chordiant offers a broad range of customer services including professional
consulting services and product support and training services. Chordiant
believes that providing a high level of customer service is critical to
achieving rapid product implementation, customer success and continued revenues
growth.

 Professional Services

   Chordiant's professional services consulting teams assist their customers
and systems integrator partners in the design and implementation of products.
Chordiant's professional services organization deploys consultants as part of
the project team alongside systems integration partners and members of the
customer's internal team to provide technical knowledge, business engineering,
project guidance and quality assessments during the project. In the design
stage, Chordiant provides a variety of professional services that help
determine a customer's business objectives and the technical requirements of
the application implementation. In the implementation stage, Chordiant uses a
delivery methodology to assist customers and integration partners in planning
and managing the implementation. Systems integrators, supported by Chordiant's
consultants, manage the overall project and implement the product with a
customer's existing communications, applications, databases and transaction
systems. In the final phases of an implementation, the systems integrators
provide education and training to enable a customer's internal team to deploy
the new system, train internal users and assume control over ongoing support.

   Chordiant's methodology includes:

  . user requirements and needs analysis;

  . business engineering consultation;

  . architectural analysis and performance planning;

  . project management support services;

  . engineering support for development and deployment; and

  . technical support for software integration and communications
    integration.

   Consulting services provided by Chordiant in the fiscal year ended December
31, 2000 accounted for approximately 35% of Chordiant's total revenues and
support maintenance services provided by Chordiant in the fiscal year ended
December 31, 2000 accounted for approximately 12% of Chordiant's total
revenues.

 Customer Support

   Chordiant's customers have a choice of support and maintenance options
depending on the level of service desired. Chordiant's technical support is
available to clients by telephone, over the Web and by e-mail. The company
maintains a technical support hotline staffed by engineers from 8:00 a.m. to
9:00 p.m., Eastern time, Monday through Friday, from its corporate headquarters
in Cupertino, California and local support during business hours for European
customers from London, England. An optional premium service is available

providing technical support 24 hours a day, seven days a week. Additionally,
Chordiant provides product enhancement releases to all customers as part of
their support and maintenance contract. Chordiant uses a customer service
automation system to track each customer inquiry until it is resolved.
Chordiant also makes use of its Website and a secured customer forum to
provide product information and technical support information worldwide 24
hours a day, seven days a week.

 Educational Services

   Chordiant provides educational services to train and enable its systems
integrators and customers to use Chordiant's products. Chordiant offers a
comprehensive series of training modules to provide the knowledge and skills
to successfully deploy, use and maintain the company's products. These
training courses focus on the technical aspects of Chordiant's products as
well as business issues and processes. A complete set of modules covering
business engineering, project management and development engineering are
available. Training courses can be provided on-site for a custom session at a
fee and are regularly scheduled through classroom and lab instruction at the
company's Cupertino, California corporate headquarters, and at its London,
England offices for European systems integrators and customers.

Product Development

   Chordiant has made substantial investments in research and development
through internal development and technology licensing. Chordiant's product
development efforts are focused on extending Chordiant's software
infrastructure, CRM business services and application functionality, self-
service and Web-based collaboration functionality, and continued integration
of key industry-specific transaction systems and services.

   Chordiant's product development resources are organized into a number of
development teams including:

  . system services and workflow development;

  . business services and application functionality and design;

  . tools and Internet development;

  . enterprise integration;

  . documentation; and

  . quality assurances.

   Chordiant's software and Internet applications teams have extensive
experience in object oriented development, data management, workflow
engineering, Java programming and Internet technologies. Chordiant's research
and development expenditures before the effect of non-cash compensation
expense and purchased in-process research and development were $5.9 million in
fiscal year 1998, $6.5 million in fiscal year 1999, and $14.4 million for the
year ended December 31, 2000.

Strategic Relationships

   To enhance the productivity of Chordiant's sales and service organizations,
Chordiant has established relationships with systems integrators,
complementary technology providers and alternative service providers.

 Systems integrators

   Chordiant has established relationships and trained professionals at a
number of systems integrators including: Accenture (formerly known as Andersen
Consulting); Computer Sciences Corporation; Electronic Data Systems
Corporation and Logica plc. Chordiant plans to expand these relationships to
increase its capacity to sell and implement its products. Chordiant has
trained a significant number of consultants in these organizations for the
implementation and support of its products. Chordiant believes that expanding
its relationships with systems integrators and independent consulting firms
will enable the company to gain a greater share of emerging markets more
rapidly.

 Complementary technology providers

   Chordiant designs products to be based on industry standards and
technologies, and to support a number of key software platforms. Chordiant has
relationships with:

  . IBM Software for IBM Visual Age and MQ series development tools and
    interface software and support;

  . Sun Microsystems for Java and Forte developments tools in support of
    Chordiant's enterprise data and transaction management services;

  . Oracle Corporation and Sybase, Inc., providers of industry-standard
    relational databases;

  . Cisco Systems, Inc., Genesys Telecommunications Laboratories, Inc. and
    Lucent Technologies, Inc., providers of telephony equipment and software
    interfaces; and

  . Ilog, Inc. a software provider of resource optimization and business
    rules technology.

Competition

   The market for Chordiant's products is new and rapidly evolving, and is
highly competitive. The competitive landscape is rapidly evolving to address
the convergence of e-business services and customer interaction applications.
To realize the potential of this convergence, companies must be able to offer
personalized marketing and sales and extend e-business services to all points
of customer contact. This must be done through an integrated system and
customer data model tailored by each company to meet its specific customer
requirements.

   Chordiant faces three main sources of competition:

  . custom-built solutions;

  . vendors with help desk, field service, call center or sales force
    automation products; and

  . vendors of enterprise resource planning products.

   There is no one competitor, nor is there a small number of competitors, that
are dominant in Chordiant's market.

 Custom-Built Solutions

   Existing enterprise systems supporting branch and call centers have
historically been custom built by professional services organizations or
internally developed. Custom development has the inherent limitation of being a
high cost alternative because it relies on building the entire solution from
scratch and the resulting configuration is difficult to upgrade to take
advantage of new requirements and channels of communication such as the
Internet. Chordiant expects that internal development will continue to be a
significant source of competition.

 Stand-Alone Solution Vendors

   Chordiant competes with providers of stand-alone solutions for Web based
customer relationship management, such as E.piphany, Inc. and Kana
Communications, Inc. Chordiant also competes against traditional client/server-
based, call center service customer and salesforce automation solutions, such
as Siebel Systems, Inc., Nortel Networks Corporation (including Clarify Inc.)
and Pegasystems Inc. Most point application providers started with a single
application focus, such as service, salesforce automation or help desks, and
then added additional software modules addressing other needs, such as e-mail,
field service or quality tracking. Although these vendors have started to
pursue the enterprise-wide opportunity of providing enterprise-wide solutions
and services to all points of customer contact, their lack of multi-channel
integration, real time data models for integration of multiple data sources and
lack of personalization capability and their client/server architecture are
limitations.

 Enterprise Application Vendors

   Chordiant anticipates competitive offerings and consolidation from several
major enterprise software developers, such as Oracle, PeopleSoft Inc., IBM and
SAP. Chordiant expects enterprise resource planning software vendors to acquire
and integrate point solutions as they approach different segments of the e-
business and customer relationship management markets.

 Other Potential Competitors

   The telephony market for equipment and software is in the midst of a major
transition from proprietary systems to open software applications running on
commodity hardware. Software acquisitions by traditional telephony vendors,
such as Lucent Technologies' purchase of Mosaix, Inc. and Nortel Networks'
purchase of Clarify are examples of the desire to move from hardware platforms
into software applications. Examples of companies providing middleware in
support of computer and telephony integration are Genesys Telecommunications
Laboratories and Geotel Communications Corporation, purchased by Cisco Systems.
Providers of client/server and mainframe call center systems include
Pegasystems for financial services and IMA and Quintus for outsourcers and call
centers. These companies have not historically provided enterprise level
software infrastructure and customer management applications but may in the
future.

   Chordiant believes that the principal competitive factors in the company's
market include:

  . the breadth and depth of solutions;

  . product quality and performance;

  . relationships with systems integrators;

  . the ability to implement solutions;

  . establishment of a significant base of reference customers;

  . the ability of products to operate with multiple software applications;

  . customer service; and

  . product price.

   Although Chordiant believes that its product competes favorably with these
factors, Chordiant's market is relatively new and is evolving rapidly.
Chordiant may not be able to maintain its competitive position against current
and potential competitors, especially those with significantly greater
financial and personnel resources.

Intellectual Property and Propriety Rights

   Chordiant's success is dependent upon its ability to develop and protect
proprietary technology and intellectual proprietary rights. Chordiant relies
primarily on a combination of contractual provisions, confidentiality
procedures, trade secrets, and copyright and trademark laws to accomplish these
goals.

   Chordiant licenses its product through non-exclusive license agreements that
impose restrictions on customers' ability to utilize the software. In addition,
Chordiant seeks to avoid disclosure of its trade secrets, including requiring
employees, customers and others with access to Chordiant's proprietary
information to execute confidentiality agreements with Chordiant and
restricting access to Chordiant's source code. Chordiant also seeks to protect
its rights in its products, documentation and other written materials under
trade secret and copyright laws. Due to rapid technological change, Chordiant
believes that factors such as the technological and creative skills of its
personnel, new product developments and enhancements to its existing products
are more important than the various legal protections of its technology to
establishing and maintaining a technology leadership position.

   Chordiant integrates third party software into its products. This third
party software may not continue to be available on commercially reasonable
terms or at all. In particular, Chordiant licenses Forte Tool and related Forte
products from Forte Software. If Chordiant cannot maintain licenses to the
Forte products or other key third party software, shipments of Chordiant's
products could be delayed until equivalent software is developed or licensed
and integrated into Chordiant's products. Moreover, although Chordiant is
generally indemnified against claims if technology licensed from third parties
infringes the intellectual property and proprietary rights of others, this
indemnification is not always available for all types of intellectual property
and proprietary rights and in some cases the scope of this indemnification is
limited. There can be no assurance that infringement or invalidity claims
arising from the incorporation of third-party technology or claims for
indemnification from Chordiant's customers resulting from these claims will not
be asserted or prosecuted against Chordiant. These claims, even if not
meritorious, could result in the expenditure of significant financial and
managerial resources in addition to potential product redevelopment costs and
delays.

   Despite Chordiant's efforts to protect its proprietary rights, existing laws
afford only limited protection. Attempts may be made to copy or reverse
engineer aspects of Chordiant's products or to obtain and use information that
Chordiant regards as proprietary. There can be no assurance that Chordiant will
be able to protect Chordiant's proprietary rights against unauthorized third
party copying or use. Use by others of Chordiant's proprietary rights could
materially harm Chordiant's business. Furthermore, policing the unauthorized
use of Chordiant's products is difficult and expensive litigation may be
necessary in the future to enforce Chordiant's intellectual property rights.

   It is also possible that third parties will claim that Chordiant has
infringed their current or future products. Chordiant expects that software
developers will increasingly be subject to infringement claims as the number of
products in different industry segments overlap. Any claims, with or without
merit, could be time-consuming, result in costly litigation, prevent product
shipment, cause delays, or require Chordiant to enter into royalty or licensing
agreements, any of which could harm its business. Patent litigation in
particular has complex technical issues and inherent uncertainties. If an
infringement claim against the company was successful and it could not obtain a
license on acceptable terms, license a substitute technology or redesign to
avoid infringement, Chordiant's business would be harmed.

Employees

   As of December 31, 2000, Chordiant employed 250 full time employees. Of that
total, 84 were primarily engaged in product development, engineering or systems
engineering, 57 were engaged in sales and marketing, 78 were engaged in
professional services and 31 were engaged in operational, financial and
administrative functions.

   None of Chordiant's employees are represented by a labor union and Chordiant
has never experienced a work stoppage. Chordiant believes that its relations
with its employees are good.

Facilities

   Chordiant's headquarters are located in offices that are approximately
31,000 square feet in Cupertino, California pursuant to an office lease
expiring in July 2004. Chordiant also leases office space in New York, New
York; Mahwah, New Jersey; Irving, Texas; Chicago, Illinois; Manchester, New
Hampshire; London, England; Neu-Isenberg, Germany; Munich, Germany and
Amsterdam, the Netherlands.

Legal Proceedings

   Chordiant is not a party to any material legal proceedings. Chordiant may be

                            SELECTED FINANCIAL DATA
                     (in thousands, except per share data)

   You should read the following selected financial data in conjunction with
the consolidated financial statements and related notes of Chordiant and
"Chordiant Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and
Results of Operations" included elsewhere in this joint proxy
statement/prospectus. The consolidated statement of operations data for the
years ended December 31, 1998, 1999 and 2000 and the consolidated balance
sheet data as of December 31, 1999 and 2000 are derived from the audited
consolidated financial statements included in this joint proxy
statement/prospectus. The consolidated statement of operations data for the
years ended December 31, 1996 and 1997 and the balance sheet data as of
December 31, 1996, 1997 and 1998 are derived from audited consolidated
financial statements not included in this joint proxy statement/prospectus.
The diluted net loss per share computation excludes potential shares of common
stock (preferred stock, options and warrants to purchase common stock and
common stock subject to repurchase rights that Chordiant holds), since their
effect would be antidilutive. See the notes to Chordiant's consolidated
financial statements for a detailed explanation of the determination of the
shares used to compute basic and diluted net loss per share. Chordiant's
historical results are not necessarily indicative of results to be expected
for future periods.

   CHORDIANT MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND
                           RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

   The following discussion and analysis contains forward-looking statements
within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E
of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, relating to Chordiant's operations that
are based on its management's current expectations, estimates and projections
about the company and the e-commerce industry, including, without limitation,
forward-looking statements that are generally identified by words such as
"expects," "anticipates," "intends," "believe," "hopes," "assumes,"
"estimates," "projects," "plans," and other similar words and expressions.
These statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve certain
risks, uncertainties and assumptions that are difficult to predict. Further,
Chordiant may make forward-looking statements that are based upon assumptions
as to future events that may not prove to be accurate. Factors that might cause
such a difference include, among other things, those set forth under
"Overview," "Results of Operations," "Net Revenues," "Cost of Net Revenues,"
"Operating Expenses," "Interest and other Income, net, and Interest Expense,"
"Provision for Income Taxes," "Liquidity and Capital Resources" and "Risk
Factors" included in these sections or appearing elsewhere in this joint proxy
statement/prospectus. Actual outcomes and results may differ materially from
what is expressed or forecasted in these forward-looking statements. Chordiant
undertakes no obligation, and does not intend, to update or revise any forward-
looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or
otherwise, or to reflect actual results or changes in factors or assumptions
affecting forward-looking statements. In evaluating Chordiant's business,
prospective investors should carefully consider the information set forth in
the section entitled "Risk Factors" set forth elsewhere in this joint proxy
statement/prospectus. Chordiant cautions investors that its business and
financial performance are subject to substantial risks and uncertainties.

Overview

   Chordiant provides software that is designed for global consumer businesses
serving the needs of one-to-one relationships in industries such as banking,
financial services, insurance, telecommunications, travel and leisure, and
other markets with diverse sets of customers and products. Chordiant's products
are a suite of applications that enables companies to quickly access the right
information and apply a common set of business rules across multiple contact
channels to maximize customer retention and satisfaction. It applies
personalized business processes to business transactions in a consistent
manner, no matter where the interaction occurs. It allows companies to
implement a solution across a wide range of devices such as Internet Websites,
in-car concierge systems, wireless application protocol enabled devices that
support mobile Internet phones and personal digital appliance devices,
traditional call centers and retail sites.

   Chordiant was incorporated in California in March 1991 and was
reincorporated in Delaware in October 1997. Before 1997, Chordiant was
primarily engaged in custom consulting services. Chordiant released the first
version of its product suite in September 1997. With the release of this
product suite, Chordiant accelerated the development of its sales and marketing
organizations.

   Chordiant derives revenues primarily from licenses of its software and from
related services, which include implementation, consulting, customization and
integration, post-contract customer support and training. Its products are
typically licensed directly to customers for a perpetual term, with pricing
based on the number of servers and the number of users.

   On contracts involving significant implementation or customization essential
to the functionality of its products, Chordiant recognizes license and service
revenues under the percentage-of-completion method of accounting using labor
hours worked as the measure of progress towards completion. Chordiant
classifies revenues from these arrangements as license and service revenues
based upon the estimated fair value of each element. Provisions for estimated
contract losses are recognized in the period in which the loss becomes probable
and can be reasonably estimated. When Chordiant sells existing customers
additional seats, revenue for the license of the additional seats is recognized
at either the go-live date or the delivery date, whichever is later.

   On contracts not involving significant implementation or customization
essential to the functionality of its products, Chordiant recognizes license
revenues when there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement, the fee is fixed
and determinable, there is probability of collection and delivery has occurred.
For arrangements with multiple elements, Chordiant recognizes revenues for the
delivered elements based upon the residual contract value as prescribed by
Statement of Position No. 98-9, "Modification of SOP No. 97-2 with Respect to
Certain Transactions."

   In situations in which Chordiant is not responsible for implementation
services but is obligated to provide unspecified additional software products
in the future, Chordiant recognizes revenue as a subscription ratably over the
term of the commitment period.

   Chordiant recognizes service revenues from consulting and training services
as these services are performed. It recognizes service revenues from post-
contract customer support ratably over the contractual support term, generally
one year.

   In the future, Chordiant expects to derive revenues from contracts that
provide for implementation services at a fixed hourly rate. On other contracts,
Chordiant expects to derive revenues from the licensing of the installed
product on a per transaction basis. In connection with these types of
arrangements, Chordiant will recognize the fair value of the implementation
services as the services are delivered and will recognize license fees on a
monthly basis at the contractual rate.

   Chordiant bills customers according to contract terms. Chordiant records as
deferred revenues amounts billed to customers in excess of revenues recognized.

   Service revenues as a percentage of total revenues were 65%, 54% and 50% for
the fiscal years ended December 31, 1998, 1999, and 2000, respectively. To help
ensure the success of early product deployments by customers, in early 1998
Chordiant began establishing a significant service organization. The
organization assists customers, and third parties such as system integrators,
in the design and implementation of Chordiant's products. Since service
revenues have a lower gross margin than license revenues, this service activity
resulted in reduced overall gross margins. Since the fourth quarter of 1998,
Chordiant engaged third parties to provide services to customers, who then
billed Chordiant for their services. As a result of using third party
resources, revenues from these contracts generated small gross margins. As a
result of expansion of its service organization and use of system integrators
that bill its customers directly for services, Chordiant believes that its use
of third party service providers will decline substantially in future periods.
Chordiant expects that service revenue will continue to represent over 40% of
total revenues.

   Chordiant sells its products through its direct sales force, and augments
its sales efforts through relationships with system integrators, application
service providers and technology vendors.

   For the fiscal years ended December 31, 1998, 1999 and 2000, revenues were
derived from customer accounts in the United States, United Kingdom, South
Africa, Germany, Canada and the Netherlands. For the fiscal years ended
December 31, 1998, 1999 and 2000, international revenues were $9.7 million,
$6.6 million and $25.8 million or approximately 78%, 38%, and 77% of
Chordiant's total net revenues, respectively. Chordiant believes international
revenues will continue to represent a significant portion of its total revenues
in future periods.

   A small number of customers account for a significant portion of Chordiant's
total net revenues. As a result, the loss or delay of individual orders or
delays in the product implementations for a customer can have a material impact
on its revenues. For the year ended December 31, 2000, revenues from EDS,
Lloyds TSB and Direct Line Group Services Limited accounted for approximately
30%, 19% and 14% of its total net revenues, respectively. For the year ended
December 31, 1999, revenues from Chase Manhattan Mortgage Corporation, First
USA and EDS accounted for 30%, 19% and 15% of its total net revenues,
respectively. Chordiant expects that revenues from a small number of customers
will continue to account for a majority of its total net revenues in the future
as historical implementations are completed and replaced with new projects from
new and existing customers.

   Since its inception, Chordiant has incurred substantial research and
development costs and has invested heavily in the expansion of its product
development, sales, marketing and professional services organizations in order
to build an infrastructure to support its long-term growth strategy. The number
of Chordiant's fulltime employees increased from 118 at December 31, 1998, to
144 at December 31, 1999, to 250 at December 31, 2000, representing increases
of approximately 22% and 74%, respectively. Chordiant anticipates that its
operating expenses will continue to increase as it expands its product
development, sales and marketing and professional services organization.
Chordiant expects to incur net losses in the future.

   Chordiant believes that period-to-period comparisons of its operating
results are not meaningful and should not be relied upon as indicative of
future performance. Chordiant's prospects must be considered given the risks,
expenses and difficulties frequently encountered by companies in early stages
of development, particularly companies in new and rapidly evolving businesses.
There can be no assurance Chordiant will be successful in addressing these
risks and difficulties. In addition, although Chordiant has experienced revenue
growth recently, this trend may not continue. In addition, Chordiant may not
achieve or maintain profitability in the future.

Comparison of Fiscal Years Ended December 31, 1999 and 2000

Net Revenues

   License. License revenues consist of licenses of Chordiant's e-business
infrastructure software. License revenues increased from $8.0 million for the
year ended December 31, 1999 to $16.9 million, or approximately 111%, for the
year ended December 31, 2000. The revenue increase was primarily due to the
growth in the number of product implementations by new and existing customers
and higher average transaction size. Chordiant's average transaction size has
increased due to deployments by its customers to larger numbers of users.

   Service. Service revenues consist of consulting assistance and
implementation, customization and integration and post-contract customer
support and training. Service revenues increased from $9.6 million for the year
ended December 31,1999 to $16.8 million, or approximately 75%, for the year
ended December 31, 2000. The revenue increase was primarily due to a
continuation in large customer implementations as well as maintenance, support
and consulting revenues associated with license agreements signed in earlier
periods.

Cost of Net Revenues

   License. Cost of net license revenues consists primarily of royalty payments
to third parties, primarily Forte Software, for technology incorporated into
Chordiant's products. Chordiant expects the relationship with Forte Software to
continue for at least the next twelve months. Cost of net license revenues
increased from $397,000 for the year ended December 31, 1999 to $912,000, or
approximately 130%, for the year ended December 31, 2000. The cost of net
license revenues increase was primarily due to the growth in the number of
product implementations by new and existing customers and higher average
transaction size.

   Service. Cost of service revenues consist primarily of salaries, facility
costs and payments to third-party consultants incurred in providing customer
support, training and implementation services. Cost of net service revenues,
before the effect of non-cash compensation expense, increased from $14.4
million for the year ended December 31, 1999 to $17.5 million, or approximately
22%, for the year ended December 31, 2000. The increase in absolute dollars was
primarily due to increased staff to support a higher number of product-related
engagements. Chordiant expects that the cost of net service revenues will
continue to increase in dollar amounts as it continues to expand its
professional services organization to meet anticipated customer demand.

Operating Expenses

   Sales and marketing. Sales and marketing expenses consist of salaries,
commissions, field office expenses, travel and entertainment, promotional
expenses and allocated facility costs. Sales and marketing expenses, before the
effect of non-cash compensation expense, increased from $13.4 million for the
year ended December 31, 1999 to $22.4 million, or approximately 67%, for the
year ended December 31, 2000. The increase in these expenses were mainly
attributable to increases of $6.3 million in personnel expenses, $700,000 in
allocated depreciation and overhead costs and $2.0 million in marketing and
advertising costs. Chordiant expects that sales and marketing expenses will
continue to increase in dollar amounts as it continues to expand its sales and
marketing efforts through the establishment of additional United States and
international sales offices and increased promotional activities.

   Research and development. Research and development expenses include costs
associated with the development and enhancement of Chordiant's products,
quality assurance activities and allocated facility costs. These costs consist
primarily of employee salaries, benefits and the cost of consulting resources
that supplement its internal development team. Due to the relatively short time
between the date Chordiant's products achieve technological feasibility and the
date its products become generally available to customers, costs subject to
capitalization under SFAS No. 86 have been immaterial and have been expensed as
incurred. Research and development expenses and purchased in-process research
and development, before the effect of non-cash compensation expense, increased
from $6.5 million for the year ended December 31, 1999 to $14.4 million, or
approximately 122%, for the year ended December 31, 2000. The increase was
mainly due to an increase of $6.6 million in personnel related expenses and
$1.3 million in allocated depreciation and overhead costs. Chordiant
anticipates that it will continue to devote substantial resources to research
and development and that these expenses will continue to increase in dollar
amounts.

   Purchased in-process research and development. In-process research and
development expense represents technology acquired that on the date of
acquisition, the technology had not achieved technological feasibility and
there was no alternative future use based on the state of development. The
product under development may not achieve commercial viability. Accordingly,
the amount of acquired in-process research and development of $4.2 million was
immediately expensed, of which $700,000 was attributable to the

acquisition of White Spider. The nature of the efforts required to develop the
purchased in-process research and development into a commercially viable
product principally relate to the completion of all planning, designing,
prototyping, verification and testing activities that are necessary to
establish that the product can be produced to meet its designed specifications,
including functions, features and technical performance requirements.

   In 1998, Chordiant entered into a license for its products and related
service agreements with Chase Manhattan Mortgage Corporation. In 2000, Chase
alleged a breach of the agreements between the parties. At December 31, 1999,
Chordiant's outstanding receivable balance from Chase was $1.7 million. On
March 1, 2000, Chordiant agreed with Chase to terminate the existing agreements
between them, and Chase agreed to pay Chordiant the $1.7 million receivable
balance under the agreements as of December 31, 1999. The parties also entered
into a separate agreement whereby Chase transferred to Chordiant ownership of
certain technology and intellectual property developed by the parties under
their prior agreements. Chordiant intends to use this technology to add
additional functionality to its core products as well as develop and market a
credit and collections application for the financial services industry.
Chordiant agreed to pay Chase $3.5 million for the intellectual property rights
to the technology. Chase retains an option to purchase a license to the credit
and collections application when it is made commercially available by
Chordiant. Chase has also agreed to assist Chordiant by providing certain
consulting services in designing the application. This acquired technology was
still in development on March 1, 2000 so the entire $3.5 million paid by
Chordiant to Chase was expensed by Chordiant as in-process research and
development.

   The value of the purchase in-process research and development was determined
by estimating the projected net cash flows related to the product, determined
based upon Chordiant's estimates of costs to complete the development of the
technology and the future revenue to be earned upon commercialization of the
products. The estimated stage of completion (expressed as a percentage of
completion) for each project was calculated and then was applied to the net
cash flows for the product. The cash flows were then discounted back to their
net present value.

   General and administrative. General and administrative expenses consist of
salaries for administrative, executive and finance personnel, recruiting costs,
information systems costs, professional service fees and allocated facility
costs. These expenses, before the effect of non-cash compensation expense,
increased from $2.7 million for the year ended December 31, 1999 to $5.5
million, or 104%, for the year ended December 31, 2000. The increase in these
expenses was mainly attributable to increases of $1.8 million in personnel
related expenses and $1.0 million in professional service fees due to an
increase in outside contractor expenses associated with increased recruiting
efforts and expanded human resources programs. Chordiant believes that its
general and administrative expenses will continue to increase in dollar amounts
as a result of its growing operations.

   Amortization of stock-based compensation. Amortization of stock-based
compensation is allocated as non-cash compensation expense to the respective
amounts in cost of net revenues, sales and marketing, research and development
and general and administrative expense and includes the amortization of
unearned employee stock-based compensation and expenses for stock granted to
consultants in exchange for services. Employee stock-based compensation expense
is amortized over a four year vesting schedule using the multiple option
approach. In connection with the grant of some employee stock options,
Chordiant recorded aggregate unearned stock-based compensation expenses of
$11.3 million for the year ended December 31, 1999 and $4.7 million for the
year ended December 31, 2000. The amount recorded in fiscal year 2000 included
$2.0 million associated with the acquisition of White Spider. Stock-based
compensation included in operating expenses totaled $2.7 million for the year
ended December 31, 1999 and $6.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2000.

   Amortization of intangibles. Amortization of intangibles for the year ended
December 31, 2000 was $802,000. Chordiant recorded intangibles in the amount of
$5.4 million of which $5.2 million was attributed to goodwill, during the year
ended December 31, 2000 due to the July 2000 purchase of White Spider.
Intangible assets for the White Spider acquisition are being amortized over a
period of three years.

Interest and other Income, net, and Interest Expense

   Interest and other income, net, and interest expense consists primarily of
interest income generated from Chordiant's cash, cash equivalents and short-
term investments, interest expense incurred in connection with outstanding
borrowings, foreign currency gains and losses and other non-operating income
and expenses. Interest expense decreased from $1.1 million for the year ended
December 31, 1999 to $269,000 for the year ended December 31, 2000. The
decrease is due primarily to decreased borrowings. Interest and other income,
net increased from $281,000 for the year ended December 31, 1999 to $3.3
million for the year ended December 31, 2000. The increase is primarily
attributable to increased interest income earned on Chordiant's cash, cash
equivalents and short-term investments, which grew significantly following the
completion of its initial public offering in February 2000. Additionally,
within the net increase of $3.3 million for other income for the year ended
December 31, 2000 is a loss of approximately $500,000 attributable to foreign
exchange transaction losses.

Comparison of the Fiscal Years Ended December 31, 1998 and 1999

Net Revenues

   License. License revenues increased from $4.4 million for the fiscal year
ended December 31, 1998 to $8.0 million or approximately 82% for the fiscal
year ended December 31, 1999, due to the growth in the number of product
implementations by new customers and higher average transaction size.
Chordiant's average transaction size has increased due to deployments by its
customers to larger numbers of users.

   Service. Service revenues increased from $8.1 million for the fiscal year
ended December 31, 1998 to $9.6 million for the fiscal year ended December 31,
1999. The service revenue increase in 1999 was primarily due to a continuation
in large customer implementations as well as maintenance, support and
consulting revenues associated with license agreements signed in earlier
periods.

Cost of Net Revenues

   License. Cost of license revenues consist primarily of royalty payments to
third parties for technology incorporated into Chordiant's products. Chordiant
began paying royalties for the fiscal year ended December 31, 1997.

   Service. Cost of service revenue was $8.9 million for the fiscal year ended
December 31, 1998 and $14.4 million for the fiscal year ended December 31,
1999. During the fiscal year ended December 31, 1998 and 1999, Chordiant hired
a number of additional service personnel in anticipation of supporting a larger
customer base in future periods. These increased investment efforts to meet
anticipated customer demand resulted in negative gross margins from service
revenues for the fiscal years ended December 31, 1998 and 1999.

Operating Expenses

   Sales and marketing. Sales and marketing expenses, before the effect of non-
cash compensation expense, increased from $12.6 million for the fiscal year
ended December 31, 1998 to $13.4 million for the fiscal year ended December 31,
1999. The increase of $788,000 in these expenses for the fiscal year ended
December 31, 1999, as compared to the fiscal year ended December 31, 1998 was
attributable to a $1.4 million increase in personnel expenses, offset by a
decrease in $612,000 of advertising cost.

   Research and development. Research and development expenses, before the
effect of non-cash compensation expense, increased from $5.9 million for the
fiscal year ended December 31, 1998 to $6.5 million for the fiscal year ended
December 31, 1999. The increase of $600,000 in these expenses for the fiscal
year ended December 31, 1999 as compared to the fiscal year ended December 31,
1998 was attributable to an increase of $350,000 in personnel expenses and an
increase of $250,000 in overhead costs.

   General and administrative. General and administrative expenses, before the
effect of non-cash compensation expense increased from $2.0 million for the
fiscal year ended December 31, 1998 to $2.7 million for the fiscal year ended
December 31, 1999. The increase of $700,000 in these expenses for the fiscal
year ended December 31, 1999 as compared to the fiscal year ended December 31,
1998 was attributable to increases in personnel related expenses in connection
with additional finance, executive and information services and an increase in
outside contractor expenses associated with increased recruiting efforts and
expanded human resources programs.

   In connection with the grant of some employee stock options, Chordiant
recorded an aggregate unearned stock-based compensation expense of $11.3
million for the fiscal year ended December 31, 1999. Stock-based compensation
totalling $489,000 for the fiscal year ended December 31, 1998 and $2.7 million
for the fiscal year ended December 31, 1999 was allocated to the respective
amounts in cost of net revenues, sales and marketing, research and development
and general and administrative.

Interest and other Income, net, and Interest Expense

   Interest and other income, net decreased from $561,000 for the fiscal year
ended December 31, 1998 to $281,000 for the fiscal year and December 31, 1999.
Interest expense increased from $121,000 for the fiscal year ended December 31,
1999 to $1,067,000 for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2000. The increase in
interest expense was attributable to an increase in borrowings.

Provision for Income Taxes

   Chordiant has not generated taxable income since inception and, as a result,
no provision for income taxes was recorded during the periods presented. Its
deferred tax assets primarily consist of net operating loss carryforwards,
nondeductible allowances and research and development tax credits. Chordiant
has recorded a valuation allowance for the full amount of its net deferred tax
assets, as the future realization of the tax benefit is not considered by
management to be more-likely-than-not.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

   Since inception, Chordiant has financed its operations primarily through
private sales of common and preferred stock, with net proceeds totaling $51.6
million, through the sale of $10.0 million in convertible debentures, and
through the issuance of 4,925,000 shares of Chordiant common stock to the
public from which Chordiant raised approximately $80.4 million in net proceeds.

   Net cash used in operating activities was $14.6 million for the fiscal year
ended December 31, 1998, $27.6 million for the fiscal year ended December 31,
1999 and $17.1 million, for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2000.

   Net cash used in investing activities was $3.1 million for the fiscal year
ended December 31, 1998, $1.9 million for the fiscal year ended December 31,
1999 and $28.1 million for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2000. Investing
activities consist primarily of purchases of property and equipment and net
proceeds from transactions involving Chordiant's short-term investments.

   Net cash generated from financing activities was $448,000 for the fiscal
year ended December 31, 1998, $34.5 million for the fiscal year ended December
31, 1999 and $80.1 million for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2000. Net
cash generated from financing activities consisted primarily of net proceeds
from the issuance of preferred stock and proceeds from the issuance of common
stock through an initial public offering and borrowings.

   On August 2, 2000, Chordiant committed to new terms and conditions for a new
line of credit composed of two elements, an accounts receivable line and an
equipment line.

   Under the new terms and conditions of the accounts receivable line, the
total amount of the line of credit is $11.5 million. At Chordiant's option,
borrowings under the accounts receivable line of credit will bear

interest either at the lending bank's prime rate or the LIBOR Option (1,2,3 or
6 month maturity) plus 2.50 basis points. The accounts receivable line is
limited to 80% of eligible accounts receivable. There was no borrowing
outstanding at December 31, 2000 under the line of credit.

   Borrowings under Chordiant's $3.4 million equipment line bear interest at
the lending bank's prime rate. Borrowings outstanding under the equipment line
were $595,000 at December 31, 2000.

   Chordiant's assets secure borrowings under both lines of credit. The lines
of credit require Chordiant to maintain a minimum quick ratio of 2.50 to 1.00,
a tangible net worth of at least $25.0 million plus 60% of the proceeds of any
public stock offerings and subordinated debt issuance, and certain other
covenants.

   Chordiant expects to continue to experience growth in its operating
expenses. Chordiant anticipates that operating expenses and planned capital
expenditures will continue to be a material use of its cash resources. In
addition, Chordiant may utilize cash resources to fund acquisitions or
investments in other businesses, technologies or product lines. Chordiant
believes that available cash and cash equivalents and the net proceeds from the
sale of equity securities this year will be sufficient to meet its working
capital and operating expense requirements for at least the next 12 months.
After that period, Chordiant may require additional funds to support its
working capital and operating expense requirements or for other purposes and
may seek to raise these additional funds through public or private debt or
equity financings. There can be no assurance that this additional financing
will be available, or if available, will be on reasonable terms.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements

   In June 1998, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued SFAS No. 133,
"Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities." SFAS No. 133
establishes a new model for accounting for derivatives and hedging activities
and supercedes and amends a number of existing accounting standards. SFAS No.
133 requires that all derivatives be recognized in the balance sheet at their
fair market value and the corresponding derivative gains or losses be either
reported in the statement of operations or as a deferred item depending on the
type of hedge relationship that exists with respect to any derivatives. In July
1999, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued SFAS No. 137, "Accounting
for Derivatives Instruments and Hedging Activities--Deferral of Effective Date
of FASB Statement No. 133." SFAS No. 137 deferred the effective date until
fiscal years commencing after June 15, 2000. Chordiant will adopt SFAS No. 133
in its quarter ending March 31, 2001. Chordiant does not believe that the
pronouncement will have a material impact on its financial condition or results
of operations as currently conducted.

   In December 1999, the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") issued
Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 101 ("SAB 101"), "Revenue Recognition in
Financial Statements." SAB 101 summarizes certain of the SEC's views in
applying generally accepted accounting principles to revenue recognition in
financial statements. In June 2000, the SEC issued SAB 101B to defer the
effective date of implementation of SAB 101 until the fourth quarter of fiscal
2000. The adoption of SAB 101 did not have a material effect on Chordiant's
financial position or results of operations.

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Chordiant's Market Risk

   Chordiant is exposed to the impact of interest rate changes, foreign
currency fluctuations, and change in the market values of its investments.

   Interest Rate and Foreign Exchange Rate Risk. Chordiant's exposure to market
rate risk due to changes in interest rates relates primarily to the company's
investment portfolio. Chordiant has not used derivative financial instruments
in Chordiant's investment portfolio. Chordiant invests Chordiant's excess cash
in debt instruments of the U.S. government and its agencies, and in high-
quality corporate issuers and, by policy, limits the amount of credit exposure
to any one issuer. Chordiant protects and preserves Chordiant's invested funds
by limiting default, market and reinvestment risk. Chordiant's interest income
is sensitive to changes in the general

level of U.S. interest rates, particularly since the majority of Chordiant's
investments are in short-term instruments. Due to the short-term nature of
Chordiant's investments, Chordiant believes that there is no material risk
exposure. Therefore, no quantitative tabular disclosures have been provided.

   Investments in both fixed rate and floating rate interest earning
instruments carry a degree of interest rate risk. Fixed rate securities may
have their fair market value adversely impacted due to a rise in interest
rates, while floating rate securities may produce less income than expected if
interest rates fall. Due in part to these factors, Chordiant's future
investment income may fall short of expectations due to changes in interest
rates or Chordiant may suffer losses in principal if forced to sell securities
which have declined in market value due to changes in interest rates.

   Chordiant utilizes foreign exchange contracts to hedge foreign currency
exposures of underlying assets and liabilities, primarily certain receivables
that are denominated in British Pounds, thereby limiting Chordiant's risk.
Gains and losses on foreign exchange contracts are reflected in the income
statement. Chordiant has entered into foreign exchange contracts, all with
maturities of less than nine months, to sell approximately (Pounds)8.5 million.

   Fair value represents the difference in value of the contracts at the spot
rate and the forward rate. The counterparty to these contracts is a substantial
and creditworthy multinational commercial bank. The risks of counterparty
nonperformance associated with these contracts are considered to be not
material. Notwithstanding Chordiant's efforts to manage foreign exchange risks,
there can be no assurances that Chordiant's hedging activities will adequately
protect Chordiant against the risks associated with foreign currency
fluctuations.

   The table below provides information about Chordiant's foreign currency
forward exchange contracts at December 31, 2000. The information is provided in
U.S. dollar equivalents and presents the notional amount (forward amount), the
weighted average contractual foreign currency exchange rates and fair value.

   Foreign currency to be sold
    under contract:

   While the contract amounts provide one measurement of the volume of these
transactions, they do not represent the amount of Chordiant's exposure to
credit risk. The amounts (arising from the possible inabilities of the
counterparty to meet the terms of its contracts) are generally limited to the
amounts, if any, by which the counterparty's obligations exceed Chordiant's
obligations as these contracts can be settled on a net basis at Chordiant's
option. Chordiant controls credit risk through limits and monitoring
procedures.

   Chordiant's international business is subject to risks typical of an
international business, including, but not limited to differing economic
conditions, changes in political climate, differing tax structures, other
regulations and restrictions, and foreign exchange rate volatility.
Accordingly, Chordiant's future results could be materially adversely impacted
by changes in these or other factors.
