                    QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS ABOUT THE MERGER

Q:  What will Mainspring stockholders receive for their Mainspring shares in the
    merger?

A:  If we complete the merger, Mainspring stockholders will receive the merger
    consideration of $4.00 in cash, without interest, in exchange for each of
    their shares of Mainspring common stock.

Q:  What do I need to do now?

A:  After carefully reading and considering the information contained in this
    proxy statement, please complete and sign your proxy and return it in the
    enclosed return envelope as soon as possible, so that your shares may be
    represented at the special meeting. If you sign and send in your proxy and
    do not indicate how you want to vote, we will count your proxy as a vote in
    favor of the adoption of the merger agreement. If you abstain from voting or
    do not vote, it will have the effect of a vote against the adoption of the
    merger agreement.

    The special meeting will take place on [June 7], 2001. You may attend the
    special meeting and vote your shares in person, rather than signing and
    mailing your proxy.

Q:  Can I change my vote after I have mailed my signed proxy?

A:  Yes. You can change your vote at any time before your proxy is voted at the
    special meeting. You can do this in one of three ways. First, you can send a
    written notice stating that you would like to revoke your proxy. Second, you
    can complete and submit a new proxy. If you choose either of these two
    methods, you must submit your notice of revocation or your new proxy to the
    Secretary of Mainspring at the address set forth below. Third, you can
    attend the special meeting and vote in person.

Q:  If my Mainspring shares are held in "street name" by my broker, will my
    broker vote my shares for me?

A:  Your broker will vote your Mainspring shares only if you provide
    instructions on how to vote. You should follow the directions provided by
    your broker regarding how to instruct your broker to vote your shares.
    Without instructions, your shares will not be voted, which will have the
    effect of a vote against the adoption of the merger agreement.

Q:  Should I send in my stock certificates now?

A:  No. After the merger is completed, you will receive written instructions for
    exchanging your stock certificates. Please do not send in your stock
    certificates with your proxy.

Q:  When do you expect the merger to be completed?

A:  We are working to complete the merger as quickly as possible.  We expect to
    complete the merger during the second calendar quarter of 2001.

Q:  Who can help answer my questions?

A:  If you have any questions about the merger or if you need additional copies
    of this proxy statement or the enclosed proxy, you should contact:

                                    General

What Mainspring Stockholders Will Receive in the Merger (page *)

     In the merger, holders of Mainspring common stock will receive $4.00 in
cash, without interest, for each share of Mainspring common stock that they own.
After the merger is completed, you will have the right to receive the merger
consideration but you will no longer have any rights as a Mainspring
stockholder. Mainspring stockholders will receive the merger consideration after
exchanging their Mainspring stock certificates in accordance with the
instructions contained in the letter of transmittal to be sent to Mainspring
stockholders shortly after completion of the merger.

Appraisal Rights (page *)

     Mainspring stockholders have the right under Delaware law to exercise
appraisal rights and to receive payment in cash for the fair value of their
shares of Mainspring common stock determined in accordance with Delaware law.
The fair value of shares of Mainspring common stock as determined in accordance
with Delaware law may be more or less than the merger consideration to be paid
to non-dissenting Mainspring stockholders in the merger.  To preserve their
rights, stockholders who wish to exercise appraisal rights must not vote in
                                                                ---
favor of the adoption of the merger agreement and must follow specific
procedures.  Dissenting Mainspring stockholders must precisely follow these
specific procedures to exercise appraisal rights, or the right may be lost.
These procedures are described in this proxy statement, and the provisions of
Delaware law that grant appraisal rights and govern such procedures are attached
as Annex 4.  We encourage stockholders to read these provisions carefully and in
their entirety.

Material United States Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger (page *)

     The receipt of cash by Mainspring stockholders in the merger will be a
taxable transaction for federal income tax purposes. You should consult your own
tax advisor for a full understanding of the tax consequences of the merger to
you.

Board of Directors Recommendation to Stockholders (page *)

     The Mainspring board of directors believes that the terms of the merger
agreement and the merger are fair to and in the best interests of Mainspring and
its stockholders and unanimously recommends that the stockholders vote FOR the
adoption of the merger agreement.

     To review the background and reasons for the merger in greater detail, see
page *.

Fairness Opinion of Financial Advisor (page *)

     In deciding to approve the merger, the Mainspring board of directors
considered the opinion, dated as of April 18, 2001, of its financial advisor,
Morgan Stanley & Co. Incorporated, that the consideration to be received by the
holders of shares of Mainspring common stock pursuant to the merger agreement
was fair from a financial point of view to such holders.  This opinion is
attached as Annex 3 to this proxy statement.  We encourage stockholders to read
this opinion carefully and in its entirety.

Interests of Mainspring Directors and Management in the Merger (page *)

     In considering the recommendation of the Mainspring board of directors in
favor of adoption of the merger agreement, Mainspring stockholders should note
that a number of directors and officers of Mainspring have interests in the
merger as directors or officers that are different from, or in addition to,
those of a stockholder.  If we complete this merger, certain indemnification
arrangements for current directors and officers of Mainspring will be continued.
Certain of Mainspring's executive officers may also be entitled to retention
bonus payments in connection with the merger.

                         The Special Meeting (page *)

     The special meeting of Mainspring stockholders will be held at the offices
of Testa, Hurwitz & Thibeault, LLP, 125 High Street, 21/st/ Floor, High Street
Tower, Boston, MA 02110, at 10:00 A.M., local time, on [June 7], 2001. At the
special meeting, stockholders will be asked to adopt the merger agreement and
the merger.

Record Date; Voting Power

     Mainspring stockholders are entitled to vote at the special meeting if they
owned shares as of the close of business on May 4, 2001, the record date.

     On the record date, there were [19,542,107] shares of Mainspring common
stock entitled to vote at the special meeting. Stockholders will have one vote
at the special meeting for each share of Mainspring common stock that they owned
on the record date.

Vote Required

     The affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the shares of
Mainspring common stock outstanding on the record date is required to adopt the
merger agreement.

Voting by Mainspring Directors, Executive Officers and Certain Stockholders;
Stockholders Agreement (page *)

     Under the terms of a stockholders agreement, certain directors, executive
officers and stockholders have agreed to vote their shares of Mainspring common
stock, and the shares over which they have voting control, for adoption of the
merger agreement.  On the record date, these directors, executive officers and
stockholders owned and were entitled to vote [10,154,945] shares of Mainspring
common stock, or approximately [52%] of the shares of Mainspring common stock
outstanding on the record date.  As a result, the vote of these directors,
executive officers and stockholders will be sufficient to adopt the merger
agreement.

                              The Merger (page *)

     The merger agreement is attached as Annex 1 to this proxy statement.  We
encourage you to read the merger agreement.  It is the principal document
governing the merger.

satisfy or, in some cases, waive several conditions, including the following:

 .    the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of Mainspring common
     stock must have voted in favor of adopting the merger agreement;

 .    the waiting period required under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust
     Improvements Act of 1976 must have expired or been terminated;

            or to require them to dispose of or hold separate any material

                              THE SPECIAL MEETING

     We are furnishing this proxy statement to stockholders of Mainspring as
part of the solicitation of proxies by the Mainspring board of directors for use
at the special meeting.

Date, Time and Place

     We will hold the special meeting at the offices of Testa, Hurwitz &
Thibeault, LLP, 125 High Street, 21/st/ Floor, High Street Tower, Boston, MA
02110, at 10:00 A.M., local time, on [June 7], 2001.

Purpose of Special Meeting

     At the special meeting, we are asking holders of Mainspring common stock to
adopt the merger agreement.  The Mainspring board of directors has unanimously
approved the merger agreement and the merger, has unanimously determined that
the merger agreement and the merger are fair to and in the best interests of
Mainspring and its stockholders, and unanimously recommends that Mainspring
stockholders vote FOR the adoption of the merger agreement.

Record Date; Stock Entitled to Vote; Quorum

     Only holders of record of Mainspring common stock at the close of business
on May 4, 2001, the record date, are entitled to notice of and to vote at the
special meeting. On the record date, [19,542,107] shares of Mainspring common
stock were issued and outstanding and held by approximately [*] holders of
record. A quorum is present at the special meeting if a majority of the shares
of Mainspring common stock issued and outstanding and entitled to vote on the
record date are represented in person or by proxy. In the event that a quorum is
not present at the special meeting, it is expected that the meeting will be
adjourned or postponed to solicit additional proxies. Holders of record of
Mainspring common stock on the record date are entitled to one vote per share at
the special meeting on the proposal to adopt the merger agreement.

Votes Required

     The adoption of the merger agreement requires the affirmative vote of the
holders of a majority of the shares of Mainspring common stock outstanding on
the record date. If a Mainspring stockholder abstains from voting or does not
vote, either in person or by proxy, it will count as a vote against the adoption
of the merger agreement.

Voting by Mainspring Directors, Executive Officers and Certain Stockholders

     At the close of business on the record date, directors and executive
officers of Mainspring and their affiliates owned and were entitled to vote
[7,252,562] shares of Mainspring common stock, which represented approximately
[37%] of the shares of Mainspring common stock outstanding on that date. Each
Mainspring director and executive officer has indicated his or her present
intention to vote, or cause to be voted, the Mainspring common stock owned by
him or her for the adoption of the merger agreement. Under the terms of a
stockholders agreement, the directors, executive officers and certain
stockholders of Mainspring have agreed to vote their shares of Mainspring common
stock, and the shares over which they have voting control, for the adoption of
the merger agreement. On the record date, these directors, executive officers
and stockholders of Mainspring owned and were entitled to vote [10,154,945]
shares of Mainspring common stock, or approximately [52%] of the shares of
Mainspring common stock outstanding on the record date. As a result, the vote of
these directors, executive officers and stockholders of Mainspring will be
sufficient to adopt the merger agreement.

Voting of Proxies

     All shares represented by properly executed proxies received in time for
the special meeting will be voted at the special meeting in the manner specified
by the holders. Properly executed proxies that do not contain voting
instructions will be voted FOR the adoption of the merger agreement.

     Shares of Mainspring common stock represented at the special meeting but
not voting, including shares of Mainspring common stock for which proxies have
been received but for which stockholders have abstained, will be treated as
present at the special meeting for purposes of determining the presence or
absence of a quorum for the transaction of all business.

     Only shares affirmatively voted for the adoption of the merger agreement,
including properly executed proxies that do not contain voting instructions,
will be counted as favorable votes for that proposal.  If a Mainspring
stockholder abstains from voting or does not vote, either in person or by proxy,
it will count as a vote against the adoption of the merger agreement.  Brokers
who hold shares of Mainspring common stock in street name for customers who are
the beneficial owners of such shares may not give a proxy to vote those
customers' shares in the absence of specific instructions from those customers.
These non-voted shares are referred to as broker non-votes, and count as votes
against the adoption of the merger agreement.

     The persons named as proxies by a stockholder may propose and vote for one
or more adjournments of the special meeting, including adjournments to permit
further solicitations of proxies. No proxy voted against the proposal to adopt
the merger agreement will be voted in favor of any such adjournment or
postponement.

     Mainspring does not expect that any matter other than the proposal to adopt
the merger agreement will be brought before the special meeting.  If, however,
the Mainspring board of directors properly presents other matters, the persons
named as proxies will vote in accordance with their judgment as to matters that
they believe to be in the best interests of the stockholders.

Revocability of Proxies

     The grant of a proxy on the enclosed form of proxy does not preclude a
stockholder from voting in person at the special meeting.  A stockholder may
revoke a proxy at any time prior to its exercise by (a) filing with the
Secretary of Mainspring a duly executed revocation of proxy, (b) submitting a
duly executed proxy to the Secretary of Mainspring bearing a later date or (c)
appearing at the special meeting and voting in person.  Attendance at the
special meeting will not itself constitute revocation of a proxy.

Solicitation of Proxies

     All costs of solicitation of proxies will be borne by Mainspring. In
addition to solicitations by mail, certain of Mainspring's directors, officers
and regular employees, without additional remuneration, may solicit proxies in
person or by telephone, telegraph or mail following the original solicitation.
Brokers, custodians and fiduciaries will be requested to forward proxy
soliciting material to the owners of stock held in their names, and Mainspring
will reimburse them for their reasonable out-of-pocket costs. Mainspring may
retain a proxy solicitation firm to assist in the solicitation of proxies and
will bear all reasonable solicitation fees and expenses if such a proxy
solicitation firm is retained.

     Stockholders should not send stock certificates with their proxies.  A
transmittal form with instructions for the surrender of Mainspring common stock
certificates will be mailed to Mainspring stockholders as soon as practicable
after completion of the merger.

conducted any business operations.

                                  THE MERGER

     The following discussion summarizes the material terms of the merger, the
merger agreement and the stockholders agreement.  Stockholders should read
carefully the merger agreement and the stockholders agreement, which are
attached as Annexes 1 and 2 to this proxy statement.

Background to the Merger

     Mainspring has regularly reviewed the professional services and information
technology markets and potential strategies, ranging from organic growth, to
partnering, to being acquired, that would enable it to enhance its performance
and maximize shareholder value.  At a regularly scheduled meeting on November
11, 2000, the Mainspring board discussed a number of economic and industry
conditions.  The Mainspring board authorized management to conduct discussions
of potential strategic transactions with third parties. In that regard,
Mainspring and Morgan Stanley & Co. Incorporated had discussions with numerous
third parties regarding potential transactions over the preceding months.

     In their efforts to enhance and grow their respective businesses, IBM and
Mainspring have held commercial discussions from time to time in recent years
concerning possible business relationships with each other.  Mainspring began
performing consulting services for IBM in 1999 and on October 26, 2000 IBM
entered into a Customer Solutions Agreement with Mainspring. Through March 31,
2001, IBM has paid approximately $1,205,000 to Mainspring for consulting
services. On November 2, 2000, Rosanne Mehales, Vice President, Industry
Programs, contacted John Connolly, President and Chief Executive Officer of
Mainspring, to set up a meeting between representatives of IBM and Mainspring.
The purpose of this meeting was to discuss the possibility of furthering the
strategic working relationships between IBM and Mainspring. On November 16,
2000, representatives of Mainspring and IBM, including Mr. Connolly and Ms.
Mehales, met in Somers, New York to discuss a potential partnership between
Mainspring and IBM.

     In late October 2000, Mainspring was contacted by an officer of a company
that develops eBusiness applications ("Party A") requesting a meeting to discuss
a potential partnership or acquisition of Mainspring. Mr. Connolly had prior
contacts with the officer of Party A in various business settings. Officers of
Mainspring met with officers of Party A on November 17 and 27, 2000. Mainspring
and Party A entered into a nondisclosure agreement on November 27, 2000
containing customary terms regarding the treatment of confidential information
furnished by the parties. At these meetings, representatives of each party
provided information about their businesses and discussed a potential
acquisition of Mainspring by Party A. On December 6, 2000, Mr. Connolly and Mark
Verdi, Chief Financial Officer and Senior Vice President, Finance and Operations
of Mainspring, met in Boston with officers of Party A to discuss potential
synergies, integration and valuation ranges.

     On December 11, 2000, the Mainspring board met telephonically with
representatives of Morgan Stanley and Testa, Hurwitz & Thibeault, LLP,
Mainspring's outside counsel. Mr. Connolly and Mr. Verdi updated the directors
on discussions with third parties regarding potential partnerships and
acquisitions, including the valuation ranges discussed with Party A. Mr.
Connolly, Mr. Verdi and a representative of Morgan Stanley discussed the market
conditions and valuation factors affecting Mainspring and potential acquirors or
partners. A representative of Testa reviewed with the directors their fiduciary
duties in connection with the potential transactions. The Mainspring board
retained Morgan Stanley to advise Mainspring on its potential sale and
instructed Mr. Connolly to approach Party A and suggest a higher valuation range
than that previously discussed. After the meeting, Mr. Connolly called an
officer of Party A and was told that Party A would not be in a position to move
forward with a transaction until the middle of the first quarter of 2001 due to
issues internal to Party A. On December 13, 2000, the Mainspring board met
telephonically with representatives of Morgan Stanley and Testa. Mr. Connolly
updated the board on the status of the discussions with Party A and the board
determined that no further discussions should take place at that time with Party
A.

     On November 16, 2000, Mr. Connolly and Mr. Verdi attended a dinner meeting
with a director of an information technology services company ("Party B") to
discuss a potential partnership or the acquisition of Mainspring.  A second
meeting was held at the offices of Party B on November 29, 2000, where Mr.
Connolly, Mr. Verdi and three other directors of Party B continued these
discussions. Mainspring and Party B entered into a nondisclosure agreement on
December 13, 2000, containing customary terms regarding the treatment of
confidential information furnished by the parties. On December 13, 2000, Party B
conducted an initial due diligence review of Mainspring in Boston, and on
December 15, 2000, Mr. Connolly and an officer of Party B discussed possible

valuation ranges and the difference in the ranges proposed by the parties. These
discussions did not result in any agreement on potential valuation ranges.

     On January 18, 2001, IBM and Mainspring entered into a nondisclosure
agreement containing customary terms and conditions regarding the treatment of
confidential information furnished by the parties.  On January 19, 2001,
representatives of Mainspring and IBM met in Detroit, Michigan.  Messrs.
Connolly and Verdi, as well as other officers of Mainspring, made presentations
regarding the capabilities and expertise of Mainspring.  Frank Roney, General
Manager, Business Innovation Services, Worldwide IBM Global Services, Tom Hawk,
General Manager, Business Innovation Services, Americas and Ms. Mehales then
discussed IBM Global Services and Business Innovation Services. At the end of
the meeting, it was agreed that Mr. Hawk and Mr. Roney would further consider
IBM's interest in Mainspring, all for the purpose of indicating to Mainspring a
price at which IBM might be interested in purchasing Mainspring, subject, among
other things, to due diligence.

     On January 25, 2001, at a regularly scheduled meeting of the Mainspring
board, Mr. Connolly updated the board regarding the status of discussions with
third parties concerning a potential business combination or other transaction.

     In late January and early February of 2001, members of Mainspring
management met with representatives of IBM to continue discussions regarding a
potential acquisition and to provide IBM additional information regarding the
intellectual capital and consulting capabilities of Mainspring.  On February 14,
2001, Mr. Connolly spoke with Mr. Roney and Mr. Roney indicated IBM was
continuing to analyze a potential acquisition. On February 23, 2001, Mr. Roney
informed Mr. Connolly that IBM was still considering a transaction.

     In February and March of 2001, Mainspring held discussions with several
parties regarding strategic opportunities and also received expressions of
interest from several parties who wished to discuss strategic opportunities.  On
February 19, 2001, Mr. Verdi met with officers of Party B to discuss potential
valuation ranges.  These discussions were not productive and there were no
further discussions with Party B with respect to an acquisition of Mainspring.

     On February 21, 2001, Mr. Connolly met with officers of Party A. Party A
could not meet Mainspring's valuation range previously discussed in December
2000 in light of current market conditions and the decline in valuations within
the professional services industry. No further discussions were held between
Mainspring and Party A. In mid-February 2001, Mr. Connolly was also contacted by
investment bankers representing an information technology consulting company,
which is a subsidiary of a foreign company ("Party C"), to express Party C's
interest in a potential transaction with Mainspring. Mr. Connolly informed Party
C that Mainspring was considering strategic alternatives and that Party C would
have to move quickly in its decision-making process. Mr. Connolly had several
phone conversations with officers of Party C and representatives of its
investment bank in late February.

     IBM delivered an initial due diligence request list to Mainspring on March
5, 2001, and an initial term sheet on March 6, 2001. The term sheet contained a
general outline of the terms of an acquisition of Mainspring by IBM, including a
proposed, preliminary purchase price range of $4.00-$6.00 per share and a cash
merger structure, and was conditioned upon the satisfactory completion of due
diligence. On March 7, 2001, Mr. Connolly and Mr. Roney discussed timing for due
diligence and the negotiation and execution of a definitive agreement.

     The Mainspring board met on March 7, 2001, to discuss the IBM term sheet
and the status of discussions with other parties, and the board authorized and
instructed management to continue discussions with IBM and to continue to
explore other potential transactions.

     On March 7, 2001, Mr. Connolly and Joe Gagnon, Senior Vice President of
Strategy Consulting of Mainspring, called officers of Party C and discussed the
businesses of both companies and a possible transaction. On March 13, 2001,
Mainspring and Party C entered into a nondisclosure agreement containing
customary terms regarding the treatment of confidential information furnished by
the parties. On March 15, 2001, representatives of Mainspring and Party C,
including Mr. Verdi and Mr. Gagnon, met to discuss Mainspring's business and a
potential acquisition. Party C gave a preliminary verbal indication of its
proposed valuation range. Party C indicated that a term sheet would contain more
detail, including a specific valuation range, and that the proposal, including
the preliminary valuation range, was, among other things, subject to the
satisfactory completion of due diligence.

     On March 9, 2001, Mr. Connolly met with Mr. Roney in Florida to discuss the
due diligence process for IBM, as well as potential integration issues and
financial matters. Mr. Hawk also participated in these discussions by telephone.
This meeting was followed by correspondence and during the week of March 12,
2001, IBM conducted a comprehensive due diligence review of Mainspring. The
diligence continued during the week of March 19 and on March 20, 2001 Mr. Hawk
met with Messrs. Connolly, Verdi and Gagnon in Boston.

     On March 23, 2001, at a regularly scheduled meeting of the Mainspring
board, Mr. Connolly and Mr. Verdi discussed the preliminary financial results
and forecast of Mainspring with the board and provided an update on the status
of discussions with third parties regarding a potential business combination or
other transaction.

     On March 28, 2001, IBM delivered a revised term sheet to Mainspring, with a
bona fide offer of $4.00 per share in cash. The revised IBM offer was
conditioned upon obtaining satisfactory noncompetition agreements from
identified employees and obtaining agreements from stockholders holding at least
a majority of the outstanding shares of common stock of Mainspring to vote in
favor of the proposed transaction.

     On the afternoon of March 29, 2001, the Mainspring board met telephonically
with representatives of Morgan Stanley and Testa. Mr. Connolly reviewed with the
Mainspring board the proposed term sheet from IBM, including the provisions
relating to the consideration to be paid to Mainspring stockholders and the
employee noncompetition agreements and retention plans. Mr. Connolly informed
the board that although a term sheet from Party C had been expected prior to the
meeting, it had not arrived and a more detailed term sheet was now expected to
arrive later that night. The board reviewed the relative status of the
discussions and due diligence with Party C and IBM, proposed timing and
valuation ranges, conditions and associated risks of the proposals. The board
expressed concern with Party C's seeming inability or unwillingness to move
decisively toward a conclusion. A representative of Morgan Stanley then
discussed the market conditions for Mainspring and its peer group and a
representative from Testa reviewed the fiduciary duties of the board in
considering the proposals. The board agreed to reconvene after receipt of the
term sheet from Party C.

     Later in the afternoon on March 29, 2001, Mr. Connolly, Mr. Verdi and
representatives from Morgan Stanley had discussions with officers of Party C and
representatives from its investment bank concerning the proposed transaction,
particularly with respect to timing and valuation issues. The Mainspring
representatives once again informed Party C that Party C would have to move
quickly if it wanted to enter into an agreement with Mainspring.

     On the night of March 29, 2001, Party C delivered a term sheet to
Mainspring.  The proposal set forth in the term sheet was conditioned upon the
satisfactory completion of due diligence and contained a general outline of the
terms of an acquisition of Mainspring by Party C, including a proposed purchase
price range of $5.75 to $6.25 per share and cash as the consideration. The term
sheet also required that Mainspring enter into an exclusivity agreement with
respect to negotiations for a potential acquisition of Mainspring which would
have required Mainspring to terminate discussions with all other parties,
including IBM.

     On March 30, 2001, the Mainspring board met telephonically with
representatives of Morgan Stanley and Testa. The purpose of the meeting was to
discuss the Party C term sheet and to review the status of discussions with IBM.
The board reviewed the principal provisions of the Party C term sheet, including
the exclusivity requirement, the requirement for employee noncompetition
agreements and the absence of any provisions regarding employee retention
proposals. Party C and other interested parties, including IBM, had previously
informed Mainspring that retention of a number of Mainspring's key employees
would be a condition to a potential transaction, and the absence of an employee
retention proposal from Party C, together with the uncertainty and associated
risk of retaining employees of Mainspring, was a matter of concern to the
Mainspring board. The board also reviewed the limited and preliminary nature of
the due diligence conducted to date by Party C and the refusal of Party C to
commence a more comprehensive due diligence process in the absence of an
exclusivity agreement. Mr. Connolly informed the board that Party C had
indicated that it needed at least a week to complete due diligence and that the
earliest it could commit to finalizing its offer was April 30, 2001. The Board
reviewed several critical elements of any transaction: the bona fide nature of
IBM's price offer versus the preliminary nature of Party C's price range, the
completion of comprehensive due diligence by IBM versus the limited and
preliminary nature of Party C's due diligence process, and the fact that Party
C's valuation range and its willingness to undertake a transaction with
Mainspring was subject to completion of more comprehensive due diligence. After
extensive discussion of these factors, the board determined that it was
unwilling to enter into an exclusivity agreement

at that time in light of the progress and status of the ongoing discussions with
IBM. The directors discussed the need to assess the probability and potential
timing of a successful transaction with Party C if Mainspring delayed responding
to the IBM offer and the risk that Mainspring could be left without either the
IBM or the Party C opportunity. A representative of Morgan Stanley presented an
update on the current status of the professional services market. The board
evaluated the Party C term sheet and reviewed the IBM proposal based on
valuation, timing, conditions and relative associated risks.

     After this meeting, Mr. Connolly informed an officer of Party C that
Mainspring was unable to enter into an exclusivity agreement and that timely
completion of due diligence was important if Party C wished to pursue a
transaction with Mainspring. An officer of Party C informed Mr. Connolly on
April 2, 2001, that Party C was unwilling at that time to conduct due diligence
without the exclusivity agreement. Mr. Connolly responded that while Mainspring
was unable at that time to enter into an exclusivity agreement, it was
interested in pursuing discussions on a timely basis. Mr. Connolly agreed to
meet with representatives of Party C on April 5, 2001, to continue discussions.

     On April 3, 2001, representatives of Cravath, Swaine & Moore, IBM's
counsel, sent a draft merger agreement and draft stockholders agreement to
Testa. From April 3 through April 19, 2001, Testa, Cravath and representatives
of IBM and Mainspring held negotiations concerning the terms and conditions of
the proposed merger agreement and stockholders agreement, including negotiation
of the conditions to the proposed merger, the circumstances under which the
merger agreement could be terminated, the representations and warranties to be
made by IBM and Mainspring, the restrictions on the conduct of Mainspring during
the pendency of the merger and the terms of the noncompetition agreement to be
delivered by identified employees of Mainspring and the related retention
packages.

     On April 4, 2001, the Mainspring board met telephonically with
representatives of Morgan Stanley and Testa to review the material terms of
drafts received from IBM, the progress of the negotiations and Mr. Connolly's
scheduled meeting with Party C the next day.

     On April 5, 2001, Mr. Connolly met with representatives of Party C to
discuss the term sheet that Mainspring had received from Party C and other
matters relating to the potential transaction, including Party C's demand for an
exclusivity agreement and delay in conducting due diligence. After this meeting
Party C agreed to commence due diligence without an agreement regarding
exclusivity.

     On April 6, 2001, the Mainspring board met telephonically with
representatives of Morgan Stanley and Testa.  Representatives of Morgan Stanley
presented an analysis of the IBM offer including a review of the premiums that
the IBM offer represented relative to recent trading prices; the risks of a
transaction with Party C, based on the delays encountered to date in the
discussions with Party C and the preliminary nature of and conditions contained
in the Party C term sheet, particularly as compared to the IBM firm offer; the
discussions that Mainspring and Morgan Stanley had conducted with numerous third
parties regarding other potential transactions over the preceding months;
financial information regarding Mainspring; and market and industry conditions,
including analysis of comparable companies.  In addition, representatives of
Testa reviewed the fiduciary duties applicable to directors considering an
acquisition for cash and reviewed the principal terms of the merger agreement
and stockholders agreement, current drafts of which were provided to each
director prior to the meeting. Counsel also summarized the status of the
negotiations and noted that execution of the stockholders agreement was
required by IBM as a condition to its execution of the merger agreement.

     On April 8, 2001, representatives of Mainspring, including Mr. Connolly,
met with representatives of IBM, including Mr. Hawk, in Hartford, Connecticut to
discuss the noncompetition agreements, retention plans and potential
organizational structures and integration issues.  In addition, on April 12,
2001, IBM representatives informed Mainspring representatives that IBM was
losing patience with the process and that if definitive agreements were not
quickly finalized IBM would withdraw its offer and terminate negotiations.

     Party C conducted a due diligence review of Mainspring in Boston from April
9 to April 12, 2001. Representatives of Mainspring and Party C continued to
discuss the requirements and timing for a potential transaction, including
potential terms and conditions and the need for Party C to act in a timely
fashion. Party C was provided the opportunity to review the same due diligence
materials that had been requested by and made available to other interested
parties. However, on April 12, 2001, Party C suspended its due diligence and
requested a significant amount of additional information, including information
that had not previously been requested or compiled and was not readily
available. Furthermore, Party C's request would have required Mainspring
personnel to perform various financial and other analyses with respect to this
information. On April 16, 2001, an officer of Party C told Mr. Connolly that
Party C would not

provide a revised term sheet until after such additional due diligence had been
completed. Mr. Connolly informed the Party C officer that time was of the
essence and that if Party C proceeded in this manner with respect to timing and
due diligence it was unlikely that Mainspring would enter into a transaction
with Party C. The officer of Party C also indicated to Mr. Connolly that Party
C's preliminary valuation range might be lowered.

     On April 18, 2001, the Mainspring board met telephonically with
representatives of Morgan Stanley and Testa to discuss Party C's suspension of
due diligence and the proposed transaction with IBM. At this meeting, the board
received a report from Mr. Connolly regarding Party C's suspension of due
diligence, the nature and extent of Party C's additional due diligence requests
and Party C's declination to make a firm offer in the absence of still further
diligence and internal corporate review. Following this report, the Mainspring
board reviewed the status and course of the discussions with Party C, including
a discussion of the time previously afforded Party C to conduct diligence and
make a firm offer, the delays encountered to date in that process and conditions
and risks associated with Party C's preliminary term sheet. Mr. Connolly advised
the board that he would place a final call with Party C prior to executing the
IBM merger agreement to determine whether Party C wished to make a firm offer.
Following this discussion, the board received a presentation from Testa on the
proposed IBM merger agreement and stockholder agreement and Morgan Stanley
delivered its oral opinion, later confirmed in writing, that as of April 18,
2001, and subject to and based on the considerations in its opinion, the
consideration to be received by the holders of shares of Mainspring common stock
pursuant to the proposed IBM merger agreement was fair from a financial point of
view to such holders. See "The Merger - Opinion of Morgan Stanley & Co.
Incorporated." After further discussion, the Mainspring board approved the
proposed merger, subject to finalization in accordance with the board's
instructions, and authorized the execution of the merger agreement on the
following day.

     On the morning of April 19, 2001, Mr. Connolly informed an officer of Party
C that Mainspring was close to concluding negotiations with another party. The
officer of Party C indicated that Party C would not respond with a firm offer.
On the afternoon of April 19, 2001 IBM and Mainspring finalized and signed the
merger agreement and issued a press release announcing the execution of the
agreement.

Reasons for the Merger and Board of Directors Recommendation

     Reasons for the Merger.  In arriving at its determination to approve the
merger, the Mainspring board of directors considered the opportunity the merger
would provide to secure a premium for stockholders over recent market prices of
Mainspring common stock.  In comparing this premium with the return of
stockholder investment believed to be achievable through future appreciation of
Mainspring common stock if Mainspring remained an independent company, the
Mainspring board considered various factors affecting Mainspring's future
financial performance and prospects.  These factors included:

 .    recent general economic instability;
 .    volatility in market prices of stock of companies within the professional
     services industry in particular; and
 .    Mainspring's ability to increase revenue and accelerate profitability in
     light of predicted decreases in demand for consulting services and changes
     in the environment for professional services, including a shift in focus to
     obtaining strategic consulting services in connection with, and from,
     suppliers of implementation services.

     In the course of its deliberations, the Mainspring board considered, among
other things:

 .    historical information concerning Mainspring's business, prospects,
     financial performance and condition, operations, technology, management and
     competitive position;
 .    current financial market conditions and historical market prices,
     volatility and trading information with respect to Mainspring's common
     stock;
 .    the merger consideration to be received by the holders of shares of
     Mainspring common stock in the merger, which as of the date of the merger
     agreement represented a premium over the market price for the weeks
     preceding the announcement of the merger agreement;
 .    the likelihood of completing a transaction;
 .    the belief that the terms of the merger agreement, including the parties'
     representations, warranties and covenants and the conditions to their
     respective obligations, are reasonable;
 .    the business and financial prospects of Mainspring as an independent
     company;
 .    the interests of certain directors and executive officers that are
     different from, or in addition to, the interests of our stockholders
     generally as described under "Interests of Mainspring Directors and
     Management in the Merger";
 .    the fact that Mainspring had contact with several other parties to discuss
     a possible acquisition over a period of six months and that although these
     parties were each afforded ample time to submit an offer to acquire
     Mainspring, none of these parties made a firm offer equal or superior to
     that of IBM;
 .    the repeated requests of Party C for new information and the repeated
     delays by Party C in making a firm offer, and the fact that Party C in fact
     never made a firm offer;
 .    the risk that if Mainspring postponed its process with IBM in order to
     pursue a transaction with Party C, IBM would withdraw its offer and Party C
     would not proceed to make a definitive offer acceptable to the Mainspring
     board;
 .    the high degree of likelihood that key employees of Mainspring would remain
     with the company after the merger with IBM is consummated, thereby
     eliminating the most significant risk to completing a merger in the
     consulting industry; and
 .    the opinion of Morgan Stanley that, as of April 18, 2001 and subject to and
     based on the matters described in its opinion which is attached as Annex 3
     to this proxy statement, the consideration to be received by the holders of
     shares of Mainspring common stock pursuant to the merger agreement was fair
     from a financial point of view to such holders.

     The Mainspring board concluded that the benefits of the merger outweigh any
of the potentially negative factors it considered.

     The discussion above sets forth the material information and factors
considered by our board in its consideration of the merger agreement.  In view
of the wide variety of factors considered, the Mainspring board did not find it
practicable to, and did not, make specific assessments of, quantify or otherwise
attempt to assign relative weights to the specific factors considered in
reaching its determination.  The determination to approve the merger was made
after consideration of all of the factors as a whole.  In addition, individual
members of our board may have given different weights to different factors.

     Recommendation of the Mainspring Board of Directors.  After careful
consideration, the members of the Mainspring board of directors who are not
employees of Mainspring unanimously approved the merger agreement and the merger
and recommended the merger agreement and merger to the entire board of
directors.  After careful consideration, the Mainspring board of directors
unanimously approved the merger agreement and the merger and unanimously
determined that the merger agreement and the merger are fair to and in the best
interests of Mainspring and its stockholders.  The Mainspring board of directors
unanimously recommends that the stockholders of Mainspring vote FOR the adoption
of the merger agreement.

Opinion of Morgan Stanley & Co. Incorporated

     Pursuant to an engagement letter dated January 23, 2001, Mainspring engaged
Morgan Stanley to provide financial advisory services and a financial fairness
opinion in connection with the merger. Morgan Stanley was selected by the
Mainspring board of directors to act as Mainspring's financial advisor based on
Morgan Stanley's qualifications, expertise, reputation and its knowledge of the
IT services industry. At the meeting of the board of directors of Mainspring on
April 18, 2001, Morgan Stanley rendered its oral opinion, subsequently confirmed
in writing, that as of April 18, 2001, and based upon and subject to the various
considerations set forth in its opinion, the consideration to be received by the
holders of shares of Mainspring common stock pursuant to the merger agreement
was fair from a financial point of view to such holders.

     The full text of the written opinion of Morgan Stanley dated April 18,
2001, which sets forth, among other things, assumptions made, procedures
followed, matters considered and limitations on the scope of the review
undertaken by Morgan Stanley in rendering its opinion, is attached as Annex 3 to
this Proxy Statement.  Mainspring stockholders are urged to, and should, read
the opinion carefully and in its entirety. Morgan Stanley's opinion is directed
to the board of directors of Mainspring and addresses only the fairness from a
financial point of view of the consideration to be received pursuant to the
merger agreement to the holders of shares of Mainspring common stock as of the
date of the opinion, and does not address any other aspect of the merger and
does not constitute a recommendation to any holder of Mainspring common stock as
to how to vote at the Mainspring special meeting. The summary of the opinion of
Morgan Stanley set forth in this proxy statement is qualified in its entirety by
reference to the full text of the opinion.

     In connection with rendering its opinion, Morgan Stanley, among other
things:

 .    reviewed certain publicly available financial statements and other business
     and financial information of Mainspring;

 .    reviewed certain internal financial statements and other financial and
     operating data concerning Mainspring prepared by the management of
     Mainspring;

 .    reviewed certain financial forecasts prepared by the management of
     Mainspring;

 .    discussed the past and current operations and financial condition and the
     prospects of Mainspring with senior executives of Mainspring;

 .    reviewed the reported prices and trading activity for Mainspring common
     stock;

 .    compared the financial performance of Mainspring and the prices and trading
     activity of Mainspring common stock with that of certain other comparable
     publicly-traded companies and their securities;

 .    reviewed the financial terms, to the extent publicly available, of certain
     comparable acquisition transactions;

 .    had limited participation in discussions and negotiations among
     representatives of Mainspring and IBM and their legal advisors;

 .    reviewed the draft merger agreement and certain related documents; and

 .    performed such other analyses and considered such other factors as Morgan
     Stanley deemed appropriate.

     Morgan Stanley assumed and relied upon, without independent verification,
the accuracy and completeness of the information supplied or otherwise made
available to it by Mainspring for the purposes of its opinion. With respect to
the financial forecasts, Morgan Stanley assumed that they were reasonably
prepared on bases reflecting the best currently available estimates and
judgments of the future financial performance of Mainspring.  Morgan Stanley
assumed that the merger will be consummated in accordance with the terms set
forth in the merger agreement.  Morgan Stanley has not made any independent
valuation or appraisal of the assets or liabilities of Mainspring, nor was
Morgan Stanley furnished with any such appraisals. Morgan Stanley's opinion is
necessarily based on financial, economic, market and other conditions as in
effect on, and the information made available to it as of, April 18, 2001.

     The following is a summary of the material financial analyses performed by
Morgan Stanley in connection with its oral opinion and the preparation of its
written opinion letter dated April 18, 2001.  These summaries of financial
analyses include information presented in tabular format. In order fully to
understand the financial analyses used by Morgan Stanley, the tables must be
read together with the text of each summary. The tables alone do not constitute
a complete description of the financial analyses.

     Comparable Company Analysis.  Morgan Stanley compared selected financial
information for Mainspring with publicly available information for comparable IT
Services companies, including AnswerThink, Inc., DiamondCluster International,
Inc., Digitas, Inc., eLoyalty Corp., Proxicom, Inc., Sapient Corp., Scient Corp.
and Viant Corp.  Based upon calendar year 2001 projected revenue estimates from
securities research analysts and the closing prices as of April 17, 2001, Morgan
Stanley calculated, for each of these companies, the multiple of aggregate value
to projected calendar year 2001 revenues.  The following table shows the results
of these calculations:

                                                              Aggregate Value/
                                                              CY2001E Revenues
                                                            --------------------
          AnswerThink, Inc.                                         0.5x
          DiamondCluster International, Inc.                        0.6
          Digitas, Inc.                                             0.8
          eLoyalty Corp.                                            0.5
          Proxicom, Inc.                                            0.1
          Sapient Corp.                                             1.9
          Scient Corp.                                              N.M.
          Viant Corp.                                               N.M.

     Morgan Stanley noted that the multiple of Mainspring's aggregate value to
projected calendar year 2001 revenues implied by the purchase price set forth in
the Merger Agreement would be 0.8x.

     No company included in the comparable company analyses is identical to
Mainspring.  In evaluating the comparable companies, Morgan Stanley made
judgments and assumptions with regard to industry performance, general business,
economic, market and financial conditions and other matters.  Many of these
matters are beyond the control of Mainspring, such as the impact of competition
on the business of Mainspring and the industry in general, industry growth and
the absence of any material adverse change in the financial condition and
prospects of

Mainspring or the industry or in the financial markets in general. Mathematical
analysis, such as determining the average or median, is not in itself a
meaningful method of using comparable company data.

     Offer Price Premium Analysis.  Morgan Stanley reviewed the average closing
price of shares of Mainspring common stock over various periods ending April 17,
2001.  Morgan Stanley examined the premiums represented by the offer price on
April 17, 2001 implied by the purchase price set forth in the merger agreement
over the average closing prices over various periods and found them to be as
follows:

       Period Ending                Period Average Mainspring        Premium of Offer Price to
       April 17, 2001                  Closing Share Price           Period Average Share Price
- ---------------------------        ---------------------------      ----------------------------

Prior 20 trading days                         2.13                               88.2

Prior 45 trading days                         2.32                               72.4

     Discounted Equity Analysis.  Morgan Stanley performed an analysis of the
present value per share of Mainspring common stock of the implied future trading
prices based on ranges of the following assumptions: revenue estimates for
calendar year 2003; net income margin assumptions for calendar year 2003;
illustrative multiples of market value to earnings of 15.0x to 30.0x; and an
illustrative discount rate range of 15% to 25%.  Based on these assumptions,
Morgan Stanley calculated present values of future theoretical values in the
range of approximately $1.50 to $4.00 per Mainspring share as compared to the
transaction value of $4.00 per share of Mainspring common stock.

     In connection with the review of the merger by Mainspring's board of
directors, Morgan Stanley performed a variety of financial and comparative
analyses for purposes of rendering its opinion. The preparation of a fairness
opinion is a complex process and is not necessarily susceptible to partial
analysis or summary description. In arriving at its opinion, Morgan Stanley
considered the results of all of its analyses as a whole and did not attribute
any particular weight to any analysis or factor considered by it.  Morgan
Stanley believes that the summary provided and the analyses described above must
be described as a whole and that selecting any portion of its analyses, without
considering all analyses, would create an incomplete view of the process
underlying its analyses and opinion. In addition, Morgan Stanley may have given
various analyses and factors more or less weight than other analyses and factors
and may have deemed various assumptions more or less probable than other
assumptions, so that the ranges of valuations resulting from any particular
analysis described above should not be taken to be Morgan Stanley's view of the
actual value of Mainspring.

     In performing its analyses, Morgan Stanley made numerous assumptions with
respect to industry performance, general business and economic conditions and
other matters, many of which are beyond the control of Mainspring.  Any
estimates contained in Morgan Stanley's analysis are not necessarily indicative
of future results or actual values, which may be significantly more or less
favorable than those suggested by such estimates. The analyses performed were
prepared solely as part of Morgan Stanley's analysis of the fairness from a
financial point of view of the consideration to be received pursuant to the
merger agreement to the holders of shares of Mainspring common stock and were
conducted in connection with the delivery of the Morgan Stanley opinion to the
board of directors of Mainspring on April 18, 2001.  The analyses do not purport
to be appraisals or to reflect the prices at which shares of Mainspring common
stock might actually trade.

     In addition, Morgan Stanley's opinion and presentation to Mainspring's
board of directors was one of many factors taken into consideration by
Mainspring's board of directors in making its decision to approve the merger.
Consequently, the Morgan Stanley analyses as described above should not be
viewed as determinative of the opinion of Mainspring's board of directors with
respect to the value of Mainspring or of whether Mainspring's board of directors
would have been willing to agree to a different consideration. The consideration
to be paid to the holders of shares of Mainspring common stock pursuant to the
merger agreement and other terms of the merger agreement were determined through
arm's-length negotiations between Mainspring and IBM and were approved by
Mainspring's board of directors.

     Mainspring's board of directors retained Morgan Stanley based upon Morgan
Stanley's qualifications, experience and expertise. Morgan Stanley is an
internationally recognized investment banking and advisory firm. Morgan Stanley,
as part of its investment banking and financial advisory business, is
continuously engaged in the valuation of businesses and their securities in
connection with mergers and acquisitions, negotiated underwritings, competitive
biddings, secondary distributions of listed and unlisted securities, private
placements and valuations for corporate and other purposes. In the ordinary
course of business, Morgan Stanley or its affiliates may at any time hold long
or short positions, trade or otherwise effect transactions, for its own account
or for the account of customers, in the equity or debt securities or senior
loans of Mainspring or IBM.

     Pursuant to an engagement letter dated January 23, 2001, Morgan Stanley
provided financial advisory services and a financial opinion in connection with
the merger, and Mainspring agreed to pay Morgan Stanley $2.5 million in
connection therewith. Mainspring has also agreed to reimburse Morgan Stanley for
its expenses incurred in performing its services. In addition, Mainspring has
agreed to indemnify Morgan Stanley and its affiliates, their respective
directors, officers, agents and employees and each person, if any, controlling
Morgan Stanley or any of its affiliates against certain liabilities and
expenses, including liabilities under the federal securities laws, related to or
arising out of Morgan Stanley's engagement and any related transactions. In the
past, Morgan Stanley and its affiliates have provided financial advisory
services for both Mainspring and IBM and their affiliates and have received fees
for the rendering of these services.

Interests of Mainspring Directors and Management in the Merger

     In considering the recommendation of the Mainspring board of directors in
favor of the merger, stockholders of Mainspring should be aware that members of
the Mainspring board of directors and executive officers of Mainspring have
interests in the merger that are different from, or in addition to, the
interests of stockholders of Mainspring.  Such interests relate to or arise
from, among other things,

     .    the terms of the merger agreement providing for the continued
          indemnification of current directors and officers of Mainspring;

     .    officers and employees with options to acquire Mainspring common stock
          will have these options converted to options to acquire IBM common
          stock;

     .    nonemployee directors with options to acquire Mainspring common stock
          will have these options accelerated and converted to the right to
          receive cash from IBM pursuant to the merger agreement; and

     .    certain executive officers (including John M. Connolly and Mark A.
          Verdi) are parties to agreements that provide for bonus payments if
          such executive officers remain employed by IBM following the merger
          and certain performance milestones are achieved. (See "The Merger -
          Interests of Mainspring Directors and Management in the Merger -
          Retention Plan and Agreement" on page *.)

All such additional interests are described below, to the extent material, and
except as described below such persons have, to the knowledge of Mainspring, no
material interest in the merger apart from those of stockholders generally.  The
Mainspring board of directors was aware of, and considered the interests of,
their directors and executive officers in approving the merger agreement and the
merger.

     Indemnification and Insurance. The merger agreement provides that all
rights of indemnification and exculpation from liabilities existing in favor of
the current and former directors or officers of Mainspring and its subsidiaries
as provided in their respective certificates of incorporation or by-laws (or
other comparable organizational documents) and existing indemnification
agreements of Mainspring shall be assumed by the surviving corporation in the
merger, and will continue in full force and effect in accordance with their
terms. The merger agreement provides that for six years after the effective time
of the merger, IBM will maintain directors' and officers' liability insurance
for acts or omissions occurring prior to the effective time of the merger
covering those persons who were, as of the date of the merger agreement, covered
by Mainspring's directors' and officers' liability

insurance for acts or omissions occurring prior to the effective time of the
merger covering those persons who were, as of the date of the merger agreement,
covered by Mainspring's directors' and officers' liability insurance policy, on
terms no less favorable than those in effect on the date of the merger
agreement. IBM's obligation to provide this insurance coverage is subject to a
cap of 200% of the current annual premium paid by Mainspring for its existing
insurance coverage. If IBM cannot maintain the existing or equivalent insurance
coverage without exceeding the 200% cap, IBM is required to maintain only that
amount of insurance coverage that can be obtained by paying an annual premium
equal to the 200% cap.

     Employee Benefits.  IBM has agreed to honor all obligations of Mainspring
under Mainspring's employee benefit plans and programs.  See "--Continuation of
Mainspring Employee Benefits" on page *.

     Stock Options. Under the merger agreement, at the effective time of the
merger, each stock option granted to Mainspring employees under Mainspring's
stock option plans will be assumed by IBM and converted into an option to
acquire, on the same terms and conditions as were applicable under such stock
option, the number of shares of IBM common stock determined by multiplying the
number of shares of Mainspring common stock subject to such stock option by an
"option exchange ratio." The option exchange ratio is a fraction, the numerator
of which is $4.00 and the denominator of which is the average closing price of
IBM common stock on the New York Stock Exchange Composite Transactions Tape on
the ten trading days immediately preceding the date on which the completion of
the merger occurs. The exercise price per share of IBM common stock under the
converted stock option will be equal to (a) the per share exercise price for the
shares of Mainspring common stock otherwise purchasable pursuant to such stock
option divided by (b) the option exchange ratio. Each option granted to
individuals other than Mainspring employees, including non-employee directors,
will be canceled and converted into the right to receive an amount of cash equal
to the excess, if any, of (a) the product of (1) the number of shares of
Mainspring common stock subject to such stock option and (2) $4.00, over (b) the
product of (1) the number of shares of Mainspring common stock subject to such
stock option and (2) the per share exercise price of such stock option. As soon
as practicable after the completion of the merger, IBM will prepare and file
with the Securities and Exchange Commission an appropriate registration
statement registering the shares of IBM common stock subject to the assumed
Mainspring stock options. That registration statement will be kept effective,
and the current status of the prospectus or prospectuses required by the SEC
shall be maintained, for so long as any assumed Mainspring options remain
outstanding. See "--Effect on Awards Outstanding Under Mainspring Stock Plans"
on page *.

     Retention Plan and Agreement. IBM has adopted a retention plan for key
senior Mainspring employees and entered into related retention agreements
providing benefits to certain Mainspring employees, including the executive
officers. The retention agreements, which will take effect upon completion of
the merger, provide for cash payments to the employees involved shortly after
the merger is completed, which total $1,740,000 in the aggregate for the
executive officers. This initial retention bonus will be in the form of a loan
to each employee secured by any shares of IBM obtained by the employee upon the
exercise of any option to purchase IBM shares, which will be forgiven by IBM
after the employee's one-year anniversary of employment with IBM following the
completion of the merger, or if the employee is terminated without cause (as
defined in the retention agreement), dies or becomes disabled prior to their
one-year anniversary of employment with IBM.

     The retention agreements also provide for potential additional retention
bonus payments if certain business milestones (which milestones are to be
established at the beginning of each period) are achieved during each six-month
measuring period, ending on each of the 12-month anniversary, the 18-month
anniversary, the 24-month anniversary, the 30-month anniversary and the 36-month
anniversary of the completion of the merger. If the business milestones under
the retention plan are met, the aggregate retention payments to executive
officers as a group will be as follows:

     Measuring Period                      Potential Payments
     ----------------                      ------------------
     12-Month                                      $1,890,000
     18-Month                                      $1,170,000
     24-Month                                      $1,755,000
     30-Month                                      $1,170,000

     36-Month                           $1,755,000
     ------------------------------------------------------------------

     Total                              $7,740,000

     In addition to retention payments, the retention agreements provide for the
conversion, in accordance with the merger agreement, of all vested and unvested
options to purchase shares of Mainspring common stock held by the executive
officers subject to the retention agreements into options to purchase shares of
IBM common stock. See "--Effect on Awards Outstanding Under Mainspring Stock
Plans" on page *. As part of the transaction, these executive officers also
waived for one year the right to have certain of their unvested stock options
accelerate upon the occurrence of the merger. If, within the first twelve months
following the completion of the merger, the employment of one of these executive
officers is terminated without cause, then the executive officer has the right
to reinstate the acceleration of vesting of his unvested shares that otherwise
would have vested on completion of the merger.

     Non-Compete Agreement.  In order to induce IBM to enter into the merger
agreement, the executive officers who entered into retention agreements have
agreed that:

     .    during his or her employment and until the earlier of (a) one year
          after the termination of his or her employment (two years for Mr.
          Connolly); or (b) three years from the effective date of the closing
          of the merger, he or she will not have a "relationship" with any
          business, whether or not for profit, anywhere in the world in which
          such executive officer shall engage or assist such business with
          respect to business strategy, process and information technology
          consulting. The executive officer will be deemed to have a
          relationship with a business (other than holding less than 5% of the
          publicly traded securities of that business) if such executive officer
          (a) owns, manages, operates, joins or is employed by such business;
          (b) is a director, member, agent, stockholder, owner or general
          partner of such business; (c) acts as a consultant or advisor to such
          business; or (d) controls or participates in ownership, management or
          operation of such business. The noncompetition restrictions
          automatically will terminate if the executive officer's employment is
          terminated without cause.

     .    for a period of two years following the executive officer's
          termination of employment,

          .    he or she will not, directly or indirectly, provide business
               strategy, process and information technology consulting (in any
               capacity) to any entity that is, or during the one-year period
               prior to the executive officers' termination was, a customer or
               active prospective customer of the business unit of IBM employing
               the executive officer during the one-year period prior to the
               executive officer's termination if (a) he or she became aware of
               the customer or prospective customer as a result of his or her
               employment; or (b) he or she (or individuals teaming with the
               employee or under the employee's business direction) had a direct
               or indirect relationship and/or contact with the customer or
               prospective customer during the one-year period prior to the
               executive officer's departure.

          .    he or she will not, directly or indirectly, (a) solicit,
               influence, entice or encourage any employee or consultant of IBM
               or the business unit of IBM employing the departing executive
               officer at the time of the executive officer's departure (or had
               been an employee or consultant in the past year) to cease or
               curtail the employee's or consultant's relationship with IBM or
               the business unit of IBM; or (b) hire or attempt to hire, or have
               a business of which he or she is a director or executive officer
               hire or attempt to hire, the employee or consultant; and

          .    he or she will not, directly or indirectly, interfere with,
               disrupt or attempt to disrupt any past, present or prospective
               relationship, contractual or otherwise, between the business unit
               of IBM that employed the executive officer or Mainspring and any
               of their respective customers, suppliers or employees.

          Bonus Pool. A bonus pool of up to $1.5 million will be available to
employees of Mainspring, including the executive officers, if certain financial
milestones are met and will be paid at or around the closing of the merger.

Appraisal Rights

     The discussion of these provisions set forth below is qualified in its
entirety by reference to the text of the relevant provisions of Delaware law,
which are attached to this proxy statement as Annex 4. Stockholders intending to
exercise appraisal rights should carefully review Annex 4. Failure to follow
precisely any of the statutory procedures set forth in Annex 4 may result in a
termination or waiver of these rights.

     If the merger is consummated, dissenting holders of Mainspring common stock
who follow the procedures specified in Section 262 of the Delaware General
Corporate Law within the appropriate time periods will be entitled to have their
shares of Mainspring common stock appraised by a court and to receive the "fair
value" of such shares in cash as determined by the court in lieu of the
consideration that such stockholder would otherwise be entitled to receive
pursuant to the merger agreement.

     The following is a brief summary of Section 262, which sets forth the
procedures for dissenting from the merger and demanding statutory appraisal
rights. Failure to follow these procedures precisely could result in the loss of
appraisal rights. This proxy statement constitutes notice to holders of
Mainspring common stock concerning the availability of appraisal rights under
Section 262. A stockholder of record wishing to assert appraisal rights must
hold the shares of stock on the date of making a demand for appraisal rights
with respect to such shares and must continuously hold such shares through the
effective time of the merger.

     Stockholders who desire to exercise their appraisal rights must satisfy all
of the conditions of Section 262. A written demand for appraisal of shares must
be filed with Mainspring before the special meeting on [June 7, 2001]. This
written demand for appraisal of shares must be in addition to and separate from
a vote against the merger. Stockholders electing to exercise their appraisal
rights must not vote for the merger. Any such vote against the merger will not
constitute a demand for appraisal within the meaning of Section 262.

     A demand for appraisal must be executed by or for the stockholder of
record, fully and correctly, as such stockholder's name appears on the share
certificate. If the shares are owned of record in a fiduciary capacity, such as
by a trustee, guardian or custodian, this demand must be executed by or for the
fiduciary. If the shares are owned by or for more than one person, as in a joint
tenancy or tenancy in common, such demand must be executed by or for all joint
owners. An authorized agent, including an agent for two or more joint owners,
may execute the demand for appraisal for a stockholder of record; however, the
agent must identify the record owner and expressly disclose the fact that, in
exercising the demand, he is acting as agent for the record owner. A person
having a beneficial interest in Mainspring common stock held of record in the
name of another person, such as a broker or nominee, must act promptly to cause
the record holder to follow the steps summarized below and in a timely manner to
perfect whatever appraisal rights the beneficial owners may have.

     A Mainspring stockholder who elects to exercise appraisal rights should
mail or deliver his, her or its written demand to Mainspring at its address at
One Main Street, Cambridge, MA 02142, Attention: President. The written demand
for appraisal should specify the stockholder's name and mailing address, and
that the stockholder is thereby demanding appraisal of his or her Mainspring
common stock. Within ten days after the effective time of the merger, Mainspring
must provide notice of the effective time of the merger to all of its
stockholders who have complied with Section 262 and have not voted for the
merger.

     Within 120 days after the effective time of the merger, any stockholder who
has satisfied the requirements of Section 262 may deliver to Mainspring a
written demand for a statement listing the aggregate number of shares not voted
in favor of the Merger and with respect to which demands for appraisal have been
received and the aggregate number of holders of such shares.

     Within 120 days after the effective time of the merger (but not
thereafter), either Mainspring or any stockholder who has complied with the
required conditions of Section 262 may file a petition in the Delaware Court of
Chancery demanding a determination of the fair value of his or her Mainspring
shares. Mainspring has no present intention to file such a petition if demand
for appraisal is made.

     Upon the filing of any petition by a stockholder in accordance with Section
262, service of a copy must be made upon Mainspring, which must, within 20 days
after service, file in the office of the Register in Chancery in which the
petition was filed, a duly verified list containing the names and addresses of
all stockholders who have demanded payment for their shares and with whom
agreements as to the value of their shares have not been reached by Mainspring.
If a petition is filed by Mainspring, the petition must be accompanied by the
verified list. The Register in Chancery, if so ordered by the court, will give
notice of the time and place fixed for the hearing of such petition by
registered or certified mail to Mainspring and to the stockholders shown on the
list at the addresses therein stated, and notice will also be given by
publishing a notice at least one week before the day of the hearing in a
newspaper of general circulation published in the City of Wilmington, Delaware,
or such publication as the court deems advisable. The forms of the notices by
mail and by publication must be approved by the court, and the costs thereof
will be borne by Mainspring.

     If a petition for an appraisal is filed in a timely fashion, after a
hearing on the petition, the court will determine which stockholders are
entitled to appraisal rights and will appraise the shares owned by these
stockholders, determining the fair value of such shares, exclusive of any
element of value arising from the accomplishment or expectation of the merger,
together with a fair rate of interest to be paid, if any, upon the amount
determined to be the fair value.

     Mainspring stockholders considering seeking appraisal of their shares
should note that the fair value of their shares determined under Section 262
could be more, the same or less than the consideration they would receive
pursuant to the merger agreement if they did not seek appraisal of their shares.
The costs of the appraisal proceeding may be determined by the court and taxed
against the parties as the court deems equitable under the circumstances. Upon
application of a dissenting stockholder, the court may order that all or a
portion of the expenses incurred by any dissenting stockholder in connection
with the appraisal proceeding, including reasonable attorneys' fees and the fees
and expenses of experts, be charged pro rata against the value of all shares
entitled to appraisal. In the absence of a determination or assessment, each
party bears his, her or its own expenses.

     Any stockholder who has duly demanded appraisal in compliance with Section
262 will not, after the effective time of the merger, be entitled to vote for
any purpose the shares subject to demand or to receive payment of dividends or
other distributions on such shares, except for dividends or distributions
payable to stockholders of record at a date prior to the effective time of the
merger.

     At any time within 60 days after the effective time of the merger, any
stockholder will have the right to withdraw his demand for appraisal and to
accept the terms offered in the merger agreement. After this period, a
stockholder may withdraw his demand for appraisal and receive payment for his
shares as provided in the merger agreement only with the consent of Mainspring.
If no petition for appraisal is filed with the court within 120 days after the
effective time of the merger, stockholders' rights to appraisal (if available)
will cease. Inasmuch as Mainspring has no obligation to file such a petition,
any stockholder who desires a petition to be filed is advised to file it on a
timely basis. No petition timely filed in the court demanding appraisal may be
dismissed as to any stockholder without the approval of the court, which
approval may be conditioned upon such terms as the court deems just.

     Failure by any Mainspring stockholder to comply fully with the procedures
described above and set forth in Annex 4 to this proxy statement may result in
termination of a stockholder's appraisal rights.

Accounting Treatment

     The merger will be accounted for as a purchase for accounting purposes.

Form of the Merger

     Subject to the terms and conditions of the merger agreement and in
accordance with Delaware law, at the effective time of the merger, Waterfall
Acquisition Corp., a wholly-owned subsidiary of IBM and a party to the

merger agreement, will merge with and into Mainspring. Mainspring will survive
the merger as a wholly-owned Delaware subsidiary of IBM.

Merger Consideration

     At the effective time of the merger, each outstanding share of Mainspring
common stock, other than treasury shares, shares held by IBM or Waterfall
Acquisition Corp. and those shares held by stockholders who perfect their
appraisal rights, will be converted into the right to receive $4.00 in cash,
without interest. Treasury shares and shares held by IBM or Waterfall
Acquisition Corp. will be canceled. As of the effective time of the merger, all
shares of Mainspring common stock will no longer be outstanding and will
automatically be canceled and will cease to exist and each holder of a
certificate representing any shares of Mainspring common stock will cease to
have any rights as a stockholder, except the right to receive $4.00 per share.
The price of $4.00 per share was determined through arm's-length negotiations
between IBM and Mainspring.

Conversion of Shares; Procedures for Exchange of Certificates

     The conversion of Mainspring common stock into the right to receive $4.00
per share will occur automatically at the effective time of the merger. As soon
as practicable after the effective time of the merger, [First Chicago Trust
Company of New York], the paying agent, will send a transmittal letter to each
former Mainspring stockholder. The transmittal letter will contain instructions
for obtaining cash in exchange for shares of Mainspring common stock. Mainspring
stockholders should not return stock certificates with the enclosed proxy.

     In the event of a transfer of ownership of Mainspring common stock that is
not registered in the records of Mainspring's transfer agent, the cash
consideration for shares of Mainspring common stock may be paid to a person
other than the person in whose name the certificate so surrendered is registered
if:

     .    the certificate is properly endorsed or otherwise is in proper form
          for transfer; and

     .    the person requesting such payment (a) pays any transfer or other
          taxes resulting from the payment to a person other than the registered
          holder of the certificate or (b) establishes to IBM that the tax has
          been paid or is not applicable.

     The cash paid upon conversion of shares of Mainspring common stock will be
issued in full satisfaction of all rights relating to the shares of Mainspring
common stock.

Effective Time of the Merger

     The merger will become effective upon the filing of a certificate of merger
with the Delaware Secretary of State or such later time as is agreed upon by IBM
and Mainspring and specified in the certificate of merger. The filing of the
certificate of merger will occur as soon as practicable after satisfaction or
waiver of the conditions to the completion of the merger described in the merger
agreement.

Delisting and Deregistration of Mainspring Common Stock

     If the merger is completed, Mainspring common stock will be delisted from
The Nasdaq National Market and will be deregistered under the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934.

Material United States Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger

     This section discusses the material United States federal income tax
consequences of the merger to Mainspring stockholders whose shares of Mainspring
common stock are surrendered in the merger in exchange for the right to receive
cash consideration of $4.00 per share. The discussion below applies only to
Mainspring stockholders that hold Mainspring common stock as capital assets at
the time of the merger, and the discussion may not apply to (a) stockholders
that are subject to special tax rules, such as financial institutions, insurance
companies,

dealers in securities, persons that mark-to-market their securities, persons
that hold common stock as part of a "straddle," "hedge" or "synthetic security
transaction" (including a "conversion" transaction); persons with a "functional
currency" other than the U.S. dollar, retirement plans and tax-exempt
organizations, stockholders who acquired Mainspring common stock pursuant to the
exercise of stock options, pursuant to participation in an employee stock
purchase plan or otherwise as compensation; or (b) stockholders that are
nonresident alien individuals, foreign corporations, foreign partnerships,
foreign trusts or foreign estates. The discussion below is based upon federal
income tax laws as now in effect and interpreted and does not take into account
possible changes in these tax laws or interpretations, any of which may be
applied retroactively. The discussion does not include any description of the
tax laws of any state, local or foreign government that may be applicable to
Mainspring stockholders.

     For federal income tax purposes, a Mainspring stockholder generally will
recognize capital gain or capital loss equal to the difference between the cash
received by the stockholder pursuant to the merger and the stockholder's
adjusted tax basis in the shares of Mainspring common stock surrendered pursuant
to the merger. If at the time of the merger a noncorporate stockholder's holding
period for the shares of Mainspring common stock is more than one year, any gain
recognized generally will be subject to federal income tax at a maximum rate of
20%. If a stockholder's holding period for the shares of common stock is one
year or less at the time of the merger, any gain will be subject to federal
income tax at the same rate as ordinary income. Any capital loss generally will
be applied to offset the stockholder's capital gains, if any, from other
transactions. For noncorporate stockholders, any amount of capital loss in
excess of capital gain in any year generally is deductible against ordinary
income only to the extent of $3,000, but any net capital loss in excess of
$3,000 may be carried forward to subsequent taxable years.

     For corporations, capital gain is taxed at the same rate as ordinary
income, and capital loss in excess of capital gain is not deductible.
Corporations, however, generally may carry back capital losses up to three
taxable years and carry forward capital losses up to five taxable years.

     Consideration received by Mainspring stockholders in the merger may be
subject to backup withholding at a 31% rate. Backup withholding generally will
apply only if the stockholder fails to furnish a correct social security number
or other taxpayer identification number, or otherwise fails to comply with
applicable backup withholding rules and certification requirements. Corporations
generally are exempt from backup withholding. Any amounts withheld under the
backup withholding rules will be allowed as a credit against the stockholder's
federal income tax liability and may entitle the stockholder to a refund,
provided the stockholder furnishes specified required information to the
Internal Revenue Service.

     Holders of Mainspring common stock are strongly urged to consult their tax
advisors as to the specific tax consequences to them of the merger, including
the applicability and effect of federal, state, local and foreign income and
other tax laws in their particular circumstances.

Regulatory Matters

     United States Antitrust.  Under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act and the rules
thereunder, certain transactions, including the merger, may not be completed
unless certain waiting period requirements have been satisfied.  On [May 4,
2001], IBM and Mainspring each filed a notification and report form pursuant to
the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act with the Antitrust Division of the Department of
Justice and the Federal Trade Commission, and expect the waiting period to
expire on [June 3, 2001], unless earlier terminated, or extended by a request
for additional information and materials, by the Antitrust Division or the
Federal Trade Commission.  At any time before or after the effective time of the
merger, the Antitrust Division, the Federal Trade Commission or others could
take action under the antitrust laws with respect to the merger, including
seeking to enjoin the completion of the merger, to rescind the merger or to
conditionally approve the merger upon the divestiture of substantial assets of
IBM or Mainspring.  There can be no assurance that a challenge to the merger on
antitrust grounds will not be made or, if such a challenge is made, that it
would not be successful.

     General.  It is possible that any of the governmental entities with which
filings are made may seek, as conditions for granting approval of the merger,
various regulatory concessions.  There can be no assurance that IBM or
Mainspring will be able to satisfy or comply with these conditions or be able to
cause their respective subsidiaries to satisfy or comply with these conditions,
or that compliance or noncompliance will not have adverse consequences for IBM
after completion of the merger, or that the required regulatory approvals will
be obtained within the time frame contemplated by IBM and Mainspring and
referred to in this proxy statement or on terms that will be satisfactory to IBM
and Mainspring. See "The Merger Agreement and Stockholders Agreement--The Merger
Agreement--Conditions to the Completion of the Merger" on page *.

Continuation of Mainspring Employee Benefits

     IBM has agreed that the surviving corporation after the merger will honor
all Mainspring obligations under current employee benefit plans.  IBM may,
however, amend or terminate any employee benefit plans in accordance with the
terms thereof and with applicable law.

     Mainspring has agreed to amend its employee stock purchase plan to provide
that (a) participants may not increase their payroll deductions or purchase
elections, (b) no new offering periods will be begun, (c) each participant's
outstanding rights to purchase shares of Mainspring common stock will terminate
immediately prior to the completion of the merger in exchange for a cash payment
in an amount equal to the excess, if any, of (A) the product of (1) the number
of shares of Mainspring common stock that could have been purchased with the
participant's accumulated payroll deductions at the purchase price determined
under the employee stock purchase plan and (2) $4.00, over (B) the aggregate
purchase price that the participant would have otherwise been required to pay in
order to purchase the number of shares described in clause (1) above, and (d)
the employee stock purchase plan will terminate at the completion of the merger.

Effect on Awards Outstanding Under Mainspring Stock Plans

     Under the merger agreement, at the effective time of the merger, each stock
option granted to Mainspring employees under Mainspring's stock option plans
will be assumed by IBM and converted into an option to acquire, on the same
terms and conditions as were applicable under the stock option, the number of
shares of IBM common stock determined by multiplying the number of shares of
Mainspring common stock subject to such stock option by an "option exchange
ratio." The option exchange ratio is a fraction, the numerator of which is $4.00
and the denominator of which is the average closing price of IBM common stock on
the New York Stock Exchange Composite Transactions Tape on the ten trading days
immediately preceding the date on which the completion of the merger occurs. The
exercise price per share of IBM common stock under the converted stock option
will be equal to (a) the per share exercise price for the shares of Mainspring
common stock otherwise purchasable pursuant to such stock option divided by (b)
the option exchange ratio. Each option granted to individuals other than
Mainspring employees will be canceled and converted into the right to receive an
amount of cash equal to the excess, if any, of (A) the product of (1) the number
of shares of Mainspring common stock subject to the stock option and (2) $4.00,
divided by (B) the product of (1) the number of shares of Mainspring common
stock subject to the stock option and (2) the per share exercise price of the
stock option.

                THE MERGER AGREEMENT AND STOCKHOLDERS AGREEMENT

     The following description summarizes the material provisions of the merger
agreement and the stockholders agreement.  Stockholders should read carefully
the merger agreement and the stockholders agreement, which are attached as
Annexes 1 and 2 to this proxy statement.

The Merger Agreement

     Conditions to the Completion of the Merger.  Each party's obligation to
effect the merger is subject to the satisfaction or waiver of various conditions
which include, in addition to other customary closing conditions, the following:

  .  holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of Mainspring common stock
     having voted in favor of adopting the merger agreement;

  .  the waiting period applicable to the merger under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act
     having expired or been terminated; and

  .  no temporary restraining order, preliminary or permanent injunction or
     other or decree issued by any court of competent jurisdiction or other
     legal restraint or prohibition which has the effect of preventing the
     completion of the merger being in effect.

     In addition, IBM will be obligated to complete the merger only if there is
no pending suit, action or proceeding seeking to:

  .  challenge, restrain or prohibit the completion of the merger;

  .  prohibit or limit in any material respect the ownership or operation by
     Mainspring or IBM (or their respective affiliates) of a material portion of
     the respective businesses or assets of Mainspring or IBM or to require them
     to dispose of or hold separate any material portion of the respective
     businesses or assets of Mainspring or IBM as a result of the merger;

  .  impose material limitations on the ability of IBM (or its affiliates) to
     acquire or hold, or exercise full rights or ownership of, any shares of
     Mainspring's common stock (including the right to vote those shares); or

  .  prohibit IBM (or any of its affiliates) from effectively controlling in any
     material respect a substantial portion of the business or operations of
     Mainspring.

IBM's obligation to complete the merger is subject to the further condition that
there not be any restraining order, injunction or other court order or legal
restraint or prohibition in effect that would result in any of the effects
described in the preceding bullet points.

     In addition, each party's obligation to complete the merger is further
subject to the satisfaction or waiver of the following additional conditions:

  .  the representations and warranties of each other party set forth in the
     merger agreement that are qualified as to materiality being true and
     correct, and the representations and warranties that are not qualified as
     to materiality being true and correct in all material respects, in each
     case as of the date of the merger agreement and as of the date on which the
     merger is to be completed with the same effect as though made on and as of
     the date on which the merger is to be completed, or, if such
     representations and warranties expressly relate to an earlier date, then as
     of such date; and

  .  each other party to the merger agreement having performed in all material
     respects all obligations required to be performed by it under the merger
     agreement on or prior to the date on which the merger is to be completed.

     Several of the representations and warranties of Mainspring contained in
the merger agreement are qualified by reference to whether the item in question
would have a "material adverse effect" on Mainspring.  The merger agreement
provides that a "material adverse effect" means, when used in connection with
Mainspring, any state of facts, change, development, effect or occurrence that
is, or could reasonably be expected to be, materially adverse to the business,
assets, condition (financial or otherwise) or results of operations of
Mainspring and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole, other than any state of
facts, change, development, effect or occurrence principally attributable to (i)
the economy in general or the strategic consulting market in general and not
specifically relating to Mainspring or any of its subsidiaries, (ii) any
litigation against Mainspring arising out of the transactions contemplated by
the merger agreement or (iii) (x) any cancellation or modification of client
engagements or (y) any decline or delay in demand for the products and services
offered by Mainspring, in each of cases (x) and (y) resulting from the
announcement or existence of the merger agreement.

     Mainspring can provide no assurance that all of the conditions precedent to
the merger will be satisfied or waived by the party permitted to do so.
Mainspring cannot at this point determine whether it would resolicit proxies in
the event that it decides to waive any of the items listed above.  This decision
would depend upon the facts and circumstances leading to Mainspring's decision
to complete the merger and whether Mainspring believes there has been a material
change in the terms of the merger and its effect on Mainspring's stockholders.
In making its determination, Mainspring would consider, among other factors, the
reasons for the waiver, the effect of the waiver on the terms of the merger,
whether the requirement being waived was necessary in order to make the deal
fair to the stockholders from a financial point of view, the availability of
alternative transactions and the prospects of Mainspring as an independent
entity.  If Mainspring determines that a waiver of a condition would materially
change the terms of the merger, it will resolicit proxies.

  No Solicitation.  The merger agreement provides that Mainspring will not, nor
will it permit any of its subsidiaries to, nor will it authorize any of its
directors, officers or employees or any investment banker, attorney, accountant
or other advisor or representative retained by it or any of its subsidiaries to,
directly or indirectly:

  .  solicit, initiate or encourage, or take any other action knowingly to
     facilitate, any takeover proposal, as described below, or any inquiries on
     the making of any proposal that constitutes or could reasonably be expected
     to lead to a takeover proposal; or

  .  enter into, continue or otherwise participate in any discussions or
     negotiations regarding, or furnish to any person any information with
     respect to, or cooperate in any way with, any takeover proposal.

     The merger agreement permits Mainspring, if the Board of Directors of
Mainspring determines in good faith that the failure to do so would be
reasonably likely to result in a breach of its fiduciary duties under applicable
law, to participate in discussions regarding a takeover proposal and furnish
information with respect to Mainspring and its subsidiaries to the person making
such takeover proposal (and its representatives) pursuant to a customary
confidentiality agreement.  Mainspring is also required to notify IBM in writing
of any inquiries or takeover proposals and the identity of the person making
such inquiry or takeover proposal, and to keep IBM informed of the status and
details of any such inquiry or takeover proposal.

     The merger agreement further allows the Mainspring board of directors to
make any disclosure to Mainspring stockholders if, in the good faith judgment of
the Mainspring board of directors, after consultation with outside counsel,
failure to disclose would be inconsistent with the fiduciary obligations of the
Mainspring board of directors under applicable law.

  The merger agreement provides that the term "takeover proposal" means any
inquiry, proposal or offer from any person relating to, or reasonably likely to
lead to, any direct or indirect acquisition or purchase of (a) assets or
businesses that constitute or represent 15% or more of the total revenue, income
or assets of Mainspring and its

subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or (b) 15% or more of the outstanding securities
of Mainspring, or 15% or more of the outstanding securities of any subsidiary of
Mainspring directly or indirectly holding, individually or taken together, the
assets or businesses referred to in clause (a).

  The merger agreement provides that neither the Mainspring board of directors
nor any committee of the board will:

  .  withdraw or propose to withdraw, or modify or propose publicly to modify in
     a manner adverse to IBM, the recommendation or declaration of advisability
     of the merger agreement or the merger of the Mainspring board of directors
     or such committee, unless the board of directors or such committee
     determines in good faith, after consulting with legal counsel, that the
     failure to take such action would be reasonably likely to result in a
     breach of its fiduciary duties under applicable law;

  .  adopt or approve, or propose publicly to adopt or approve, any takeover
     proposal; or

     Termination.  The merger agreement may be terminated at any time prior to
the effective time of the merger, whether before or after the adoption of the
merger agreement by the stockholders of Mainspring:

  .  by mutual written consent of IBM and Mainspring;

  .  by IBM or Mainspring, if the merger has not been completed by September 1,
     2001 for any reason; provided, however, that this right to terminate the
     merger agreement will not be available to a party whose failure to perform
     any of its obligations under the merger agreement was a principal cause or
     resulted in the failure of the merger to be completed by that date and such
     failure constituted a breach of the merger agreement;

  .  by IBM or Mainspring, if any legal restraint or prohibition is in effect,
     which has become final and nonappealable, preventing the completion of the
     merger;

  .  by either IBM or Mainspring, if the stockholders of Mainspring do not adopt
     the merger at a stockholders meeting, any adjournment or postponement
     thereto or by written consent;

  .  by IBM or Mainspring, if the other party has breached or failed to perform
     in any material respect any of its representations, warranties, covenants
     or other agreements contained in the merger agreement, which breach or
     failure to perform would give rise to the failure of a condition to the
     merger and cannot be cured or has not been cured within 30 calendar days
     after the written notice; or

  .  by IBM if any restraining order, injunction or other order or decree issued
     by any court of competent jurisdiction or other legal restraint or
     prohibition having any of the effects described in the bullet points in the
     second paragraph under "--Conditions to the Completion of the Merger" has
     become final and nonappealable.

     Conduct of Business Pending the Merger.  Under the merger agreement,
Mainspring has agreed that, prior to the effective time of the merger, it will,

efforts to (a) comply with all applicable laws, rules and regulations; (b)

approximately [52%] of the outstanding Mainspring common stock.

  Voting. The stockholders signing the stockholders agreement agreed, among

stockholders signing the agreement also agreed to vote against any takeover
proposal or other transaction involving Mainspring that would prevent or delay
the completion of the merger or change in any manner the voting rights of
holders of Mainspring common stock. In order to secure these obligations, the
stockholders signing the stockholders agreement granted a proxy and power of
attorney with respect to any of their Mainspring shares with respect to such
matters to certain officers of IBM or a person designated by IBM.

  Restrictions on Transfer and Other Voting Arrangements.  The stockholders
party to the stockholders agreement have agreed not to sell, transfer, pledge
assign or otherwise transfer any Mainspring shares subject to the stockholders
agreement unless the transferee enters into a stockholder agreement with IBM

trust.

they permit any investment banker, attorney, accountant or other advisor or
representative retained by him, her or it to, directly or indirectly solicit,
initiate, encourage or otherwise facilitate any takeover proposal, as described

Mainspring that would prevent or delay the completion of the merger or enter
into any agreement, or engage in or continue any discussions, relating to any of
the foregoing.

  Option. The stockholders have granted IBM an option to purchase their shares
of Mainspring common stock for $4.00 per share at any time after takeover
proposal has been made by a third party.

  Termination. The stockholders agreement provides that it will terminate upon

agreement (if terminated by IBM) or, with respect to the option granted
thereunder and the general provisions, 45 days after the termination of the
merger agreement (if terminated other than by IBM).

no later than the close of business on December 28, 2001.  If a stockholder who
wishes to present a proposal fails to notify Mainspring by December 28, 2001,
the stockholder would not be entitled to present the proposal at the meeting.

stockholders, then under the proxy rules of the Securities and Exchange
Commission, the proxies solicited by management with respect to the next annual
meeting of stockholders will confer discretionary voting authority with respect
to the stockholder's proposal on the persons selected by management to vote the
proxies. If a stockholder makes a timely notification, the persons appointed as
proxies may still exercise discretionary voting authority under circumstances
consistent with the SEC's proxy rules.

applicable law.

          (b)  The By-laws of the Company, as in effect immediately prior to the
Effective Time, shall be the By-laws of the Surviving Corporation until

          SECTION 2.01.  Conversion of Capital Stock.  At the Effective Time, by
                         ----------------------------
virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the holder of any
shares of Common Stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Company (the "Company
Common Stock"), or any shares of capital stock of Sub:

          (a)  Capital Stock of Sub.  Each issued and outstanding share of
               ---------------------
     common stock of Sub shall be converted into and become one fully paid and
     nonassessable share of common stock of the Surviving Corporation.

          (b)  Cancelation of Treasury Stock and Parent-Owned Stock.  All shares
               -----------------------------------------------------
     of Company Common Stock that are owned by the Company, as treasury stock,
     Parent or Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time shall automatically
     be canceled and retired and shall cease to exist and no consideration shall
     be delivered in exchange therefor.

          (c)  Conversion of Company Common Stock. Each share of Company Common
               -----------------------------------
     Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other
     than shares to be canceled in accordance with Section 2.01(b) and the
     Appraisal Shares (as defined in Section 2.01(d)) shall be converted into
     the right to receive $4.00 in cash, without interest (the "Merger
     Consideration").  At the Effective Time all such shares shall no longer be
     outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and shall cease to exist,
     and each holder of a certificate that immediately prior to the Effective
     Time represented any such shares (a "Certificate") shall cease to have any
     rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the Merger
     Consideration.  The right of any holder of any share of Company Common
     Stock to receive the Merger Consideration shall be subject to and reduced
     by the

     amount of any withholding that is required under applicable tax law.

          (d)  Appraisal Rights.  Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to
               -----------------
     the contrary, shares (the "Appraisal Shares") of Company Common Stock
     issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time that are
     held by any holder who is entitled to demand and properly demands appraisal
     of such shares pursuant to, and who complies in all respects with, the
     provisions of Section 262 of the DGCL ("Section 262") shall not be
     converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration as provided in
     Section 2.01(c), but instead such holder shall be entitled to payment of
     the fair value of such shares in accordance with the provisions of Section
     262.  At the Effective Time, the Appraisal Shares shall no longer be
     outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and shall cease to exist,
     and each holder of Appraisal Shares shall cease to have any rights with
     respect thereto, except the right to receive the fair value of such shares
     in accordance with the provisions of Section 262. Notwithstanding the
     foregoing, if any such holder shall fail to perfect or otherwise shall
     waive, withdraw or lose the right to appraisal under Section 262 or a court
     of competent jurisdiction shall determine that such holder is not entitled
     to the relief provided by Section 262, then the right of such holder to be
     paid the fair value of such holder's Appraisal Shares under Section 262
     shall cease and such Appraisal Shares shall be deemed to have been
     converted at the Effective Time into, and shall have become, the right to
     receive the Merger Consideration as provided in Section 2.01(c). The
     Company shall serve prompt notice to Parent of any demands for appraisal of
     any shares of Company Common Stock, withdrawals of such demands and any
     other instruments served pursuant to the DGCL received by the Company, and
     Parent shall have the right to participate in and direct all negotiations
     and proceedings with respect to such demands.  The Company shall not,
     without the prior written consent of Parent, make any payment with respect
     to, or settle or offer to settle, any such demands, or agree to do or
     commit to do any of the foregoing.

          SECTION 2.02.  Exchange of Certificates. (a)  Paying Agent.  Prior to
                         -------------------------      -------------
the Effective Time, Parent shall designate a bank or trust company reasonably
acceptable to the Company to act as agent for the payment of the Merger
Consideration upon surrender of Certificates (the "Paying Agent"), and, at the
Effective Time, Parent shall

make available, or cause the Surviving Corporation to make available, to the
Paying Agent funds in amounts and at the times necessary for the payment of the
Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 2.01(c) upon surrender of Certificates,
it being understood that any and all interest earned on funds made available to
the Paying Agent pursuant to this Agreement shall be turned over to Parent.

          (b)  Exchange Procedure.  As soon as practicable after the Effective
               -------------------
Time, the Paying Agent shall mail to each holder of record of a Certificate (i)
a form of letter of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be
effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates held by such person
shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the Certificates to the Paying Agent
and shall be in a form and have such other provisions as Parent may reasonably
specify) and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the
Certificates in exchange for the Merger Consideration.  Upon surrender of a
Certificate for cancelation to the Paying Agent or to such other agent or agents
as may be appointed by Parent, together with such letter of transmittal, duly
completed and validly executed, and such other documents as may reasonably be
required by the Paying Agent, the holder of such Certificate shall be entitled
to receive in exchange therefor the amount of cash into which the shares
formerly represented by such Certificate shall have been converted pursuant to
Section 2.01(c), and the Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be canceled.
In the event of a transfer of ownership of shares that is not registered in the
stock transfer books of the Company, payment may be made to a person other than
the person in whose name the Certificate so surrendered is registered if such
Certificate shall be properly endorsed or otherwise be in proper form for
transfer and the person requesting such payment shall pay any transfer or other
taxes required by reason of the payment to a person other than the registered
holder of such Certificate or establish to the satisfaction of the Surviving
Corporation that such tax has been paid or is not applicable.  No interest shall
be paid or shall accrue on the cash payable upon surrender of any Certificate.

          (c)  No Further Ownership Rights in Company Common Stock.  All cash
               ----------------------------------------------------
paid upon the surrender of a Certificate in accordance with the terms of this
Article II shall be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights
pertaining to the shares of Company Common Stock formerly represented by such
Certificate.  At the close of business on the day on which the Effective Time
occurs the stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed, and there shall
be no further registration of transfers on the stock

transfer books of the Surviving Corporation of the shares that were outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time If, after the Effective Time,
Certificates are presented to the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent for
transfer or any other reason, they shall be canceled and exchanged as provided
in this Article II.

          (d)  No Liability.  None of Parent, Sub, the Company or the Paying
               -------------
Agent shall be liable to any person in respect of any cash delivered to a public
official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar law.
If any Certificates shall not have been surrendered prior to two years after the
Effective Time (or immediately prior to such earlier date on which any Merger
Consideration would otherwise escheat to or became the property of any
Governmental Entity (as defined in Section 3.01(d)), any such Merger
Consideration in respect thereof shall, to the extent permitted by applicable
law, become the property of the Surviving Corporation, free and clear of all
claims or interest of any person previously entitled thereto.

          (e)  Withholding Rights.  Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the
               -------------------
Paying Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration
otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of shares of Company
Common Stock such amounts as Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying
Agent is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such
payment under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"), or any
provision of state, local or foreign tax law.  To the extent that amounts are so
withheld and paid over to the appropriate taxing authority by Parent, the
Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent, such withheld amounts shall be
treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of
the shares of Company Common Stock in respect of which such deduction and
withholding was made by Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent.

                                  ARTICLE III

                        Representations and Warranties
                        ------------------------------

          SECTION 3.01.  Representations and Warranties of the Company.  Except
                         --------------------------------- ------------
as set forth on the disclosure schedule (each section of which qualifies the
correspondingly numbered representation and warranty or covenant to the extent
specified therein and such other representations and warranties or covenants to
the extent a matter in such section is disclosed in such a way as to make its
relevance to the information called for by such other representation

and warranty or covenant readily apparent) delivered by the Company to Parent
prior to the execution of this Agreement (the "Company Disclosure Schedule") or,
with respect to actions and matters arising after the date of this Agreement, as
expressly contemplated by this Agreement or the Company Disclosure Schedule, the
Company represents and warrants to Parent and Sub as follows:

          (a)  Organization, Standing and Corporate Power. Each of the Company
               -------------------------------------------
and its subsidiaries (as defined in Section 8.03) (i) is a corporation duly
organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the
jurisdiction of its organization, (ii) has all requisite corporate, company or
partnership power and authority to carry on its business as now being conducted
and (iii) is duly qualified or licensed to do business and is in good standing
in each jurisdiction in which the nature of its business or the ownership,
leasing or operation of its properties makes such qualification or licensing
necessary, other than where the failure to be so organized, existing, qualified
or licensed or in good standing (except in the case of clause (i) above with
respect to the Company) individually or in the aggregate could not reasonably be
expected to have a material adverse effect (as defined in Section 8.03) on the
Company.  The Company has delivered to Parent complete and correct copies of its
Certificate of Incorporation and By-laws and the certificates of incorporation
and by-laws (or similar organizational documents) of each of its subsidiaries,
in each case as amended to the date of this Agreement.  The Company has made
available to Parent and its representatives true and complete copies of the
minutes (or, in the case of minutes that have not yet been finalized, drafts
thereof) of all meetings of the stockholders, the Board of Directors and each
committee of the Board of Directors of the Company and each of its subsidiaries
held since January 1, 1999 (it being understood and agreed that the portions of
such minutes (or drafts thereof) that relate to any Takeover Proposal (as
defined in Section 4.02(a)) made prior to the date of this Agreement have been
redacted).

          (b)  Subsidiaries. Section 3.01(b) of the Company Disclosure Schedule
               -------------
lists each subsidiary of the Company. All the outstanding shares of capital
stock or other equity or voting interests of each such subsidiary are owned by
the Company, free and clear of all pledges, claims, liens, charges, encumbrances
and security interests of any kind or nature whatsoever (collectively, "Liens"),
and are duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable. Except
for the capital stock or other equity or voting interests of its subsidiaries,
the Company does not own,

directly or indirectly, any capital stock or other equity or voting interests in
any corporation, partnership, joint venture, association or other entity.

          (c)  Capital Structure.  (i) The authorized capital stock of the
               ------------------
Company consists of 250,000,000 shares of Company Common Stock and 25,000,000
shares of preferred stock, par value $0.01 per share (the "Company Preferred
Stock").  At the close of business on April 17, 2001, (i) 19,542,107 shares of
Company Common Stock (excluding treasury shares) were issued and outstanding,
none of which were held by any subsidiary of the Company, (ii) 4,000 shares of
Company Common Stock were held by the Company in its treasury, (iii) no shares
of Company Preferred Stock were issued or outstanding or were held by the
Company in its treasury, (iv) 10,095,219 shares of Company Common Stock were
reserved and available for issuance pursuant to the Amended and Restated 1996
Omnibus Stock Plan, the 2000 Stock Option and Incentive Plan and the 2000 Non-
Employee Director Stock Option Plan (collectively, the "Company Stock Plans"),
of which 5,157,110 shares were subject to issued and outstanding options under
the Company Stock Plans and (v) 1,339,342 shares of Company Common Stock were
reserved and available for issuance pursuant to the 2000 Employee Stock Purchase
Plan (the "ESPP") of which no more than 100,000 shares of Company Common Stock
were subject to outstanding purchase rights under the ESPP.  The Company has
delivered to Parent a complete and correct list, as of the close of business on
April 17, 2001, of all outstanding stock options or other rights to purchase
Company Common Stock granted under the Company Stock Plans or otherwise
(collectively, the "Stock Options"), the number of shares of Company Common
Stock subject to each such Stock Option, the grant dates and exercise prices and
vesting schedule of each such Stock Option and the names of the holders thereof.
Other than the Stock Options and rights under the ESPP, there are no outstanding
rights of any person to receive Company Common Stock under the Company Stock
Plans or otherwise, or on a deferred basis or otherwise.  As of the close of
business on April 17, 2001, there were outstanding Stock Options to purchase
2,236,710 shares of Company Common Stock with exercise prices on a per share
basis lower than the Merger Consideration, and the weighted average exercise
price of such Stock Options was equal to approximately $1.65.  The maximum
number of shares of Company Common Stock that could be purchased with
accumulated payroll deductions under the ESPP as of April 30, 2001 (assuming for
such purpose that the fair market value of a share of Company Common Stock on
such date is equal to the Merger Consideration) is 77,003.

          (ii)   Except as set forth above, as of the close of business on April
     17, 2001, no shares of capital stock or other voting securities of the
     Company, or options, warrants or other rights to acquire or receive any
     such stock or securities were issued, reserved for issuance or outstanding.
     Since April 17, 2001, until the date of this Agreement, (x) there have been
     no issuances by the Company of shares of capital stock or other voting
     securities of the Company other than issuances of shares of Company Common
     Stock pursuant to the exercise of Stock Options or rights under the ESPP,
     in each case outstanding on such date as required by their terms as in
     effect on the date of this Agreement and (y) there have been no issuances
     by the Company of options, warrants or other rights to acquire shares of
     capital stock or other voting securities from the Company, other than for
     rights that may have arisen under the ESPP. There are no outstanding stock
     appreciation rights or other rights (other than rights that may have arisen
     under the ESPP) that are linked to the price of the Company Common Stock
     that were not granted in tandem with a related Stock Option.

          (iii)  All outstanding shares of capital stock of the Company are, and
     all shares that may be issued pursuant to the Company Stock Plans and the
     ESPP will be, when issued in accordance with the terms thereof, duly
     authorized, validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable and not subject to
     preemptive rights. There are no bonds, debentures, notes or other
     indebtedness of the Company or any of it subsidiaries, and no securities or
     other instruments or obligations of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
     the value of which is in any way based upon or derived from any capital or
     voting stock of the Company, having the right to vote (or convertible into,
     or exchangeable for, securities having the right to vote) on any matters on
     which stockholders of the Company may vote. Except as set forth above and
     except as expressly permitted under Section 4.01(a), there are no
     securities, options, warrants, calls, rights, contracts, commitments,
     agreements, instruments, arrangements, understandings, obligations or
     undertakings of any kind to which the Company or any of its subsidiaries is
     a party, or by which the Company or any of its subsidiaries is bound,
     obligating the Company or any of its subsidiaries to issue, deliver or
     sell, or cause to be issued, delivered or sold, additional shares of
     capital stock or other voting securities of, or securities convertible
     into, or exchangeable or exercisable for, shares of capital

     stock or other voting securities of, the Company or any of its subsidiaries
     or obligating the Company or any of its subsidiaries to issue, grant,
     extend or enter into any such security, option, warrant, call, right,
     contract, commitment, agreement, instrument, arrangement, understanding,
     obligation or undertaking. As of the date of this Agreement, the Original
     Shares (as such term is defined in the Stockholders Agreement) represent
     more than 50% of the shares of Company Common Stock outstanding. There are
     not any outstanding contractual obligations of the Company or any of its
     subsidiaries to (i) repurchase, redeem or otherwise acquire any shares of
     capital stock of the Company or any of its subsidiaries or (ii) vote or
     dispose of any shares of the capital stock of any of its subsidiaries. The
     Company is not a party to any voting agreements with respect to any shares
     of the capital stock or other voting securities of the Company or any of
     its subsidiaries and, to the knowledge of the Company (which, for purposes
     of this representation and warranty, is limited to the actual knowledge of
     the chief executive officer or the chief financial officer of the Company),
     as of the date of this Agreement, there are no irrevocable proxies and no
     other voting agreements with respect to any shares of the capital stock or
     other voting securities of the Company or any of its subsidiaries.

          (d)  Authority; Noncontravention.  The Company has the requisite
               ----------------------------
corporate power and authority to execute and deliver this Agreement, to
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, subject, in the case
of the Merger, to obtaining the Stockholder Approval (as defined in Section
3.01(r)), and to comply with the provisions of this Agreement. The execution and
delivery of this Agreement by the Company, the consummation by the Company of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the Stockholders Agreement
and the compliance by the Company with the provisions of this Agreement have
been duly authorized by all necessary corporate action on the part of the
Company and no other corporate proceedings on the part of the Company are
necessary to authorize this Agreement or to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, subject, in the case of the Merger, to obtaining
the Stockholder Approval. This Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by
the Company and, assuming the due authorization, execution and delivery by
Parent and Sub, constitutes a valid and binding obligation of the Company,
enforceable against the Company in accordance with its terms (except insofar as
enforceability may be limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency,
reorganization,

moratorium or similar laws affecting creditors' rights generally, or by
principles governing the availability of equitable remedies). The Board of
Directors of the Company, at a meeting duly called and held at which all
directors of the Company were present either in person or by telephone, duly and
unanimously adopted resolutions (i) approving and declaring advisable this
Agreement, (ii) declaring that it is in the best interests of the Company's
stockholders that the Company enter into this Agreement and consummate the
Merger on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement,
(iii) declaring that the consideration to be paid to the Company's stockholders
in the Merger is fair to such stockholders, (iv) directing that this Agreement
be submitted to a vote at a meeting of the Company's stockholders to be held as
promptly as practicable following the date of this Agreement, (v) recommending
that such stockholders adopt this Agreement and (vi) approving the Stockholders
Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, which resolutions have not
been subsequently rescinded, modified or withdrawn in any way. The execution and
delivery of this Agreement and the Stockholders Agreement and the consummation
of the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby and compliance by the
Company with the provisions of this Agreement do not and will not conflict with,
or result in any violation or breach of, or default (with or without notice or
lapse of time, or both) under, or give rise to a right of, or result in,
termination, cancelation or acceleration of any obligation or to loss of a
material benefit under, or result in the creation of any Lien in or upon any of
the properties or assets of the Company or any of its subsidiaries under, or
give rise to any increased, additional, accelerated or guaranteed rights or
entitlements under, any provision of (i) the Certificate of Incorporation or By-
laws of the Company or the certificate of incorporation or by-laws (or similar
organizational documents) of any of its subsidiaries, (ii) any loan or credit
agreement, bond, debenture, note, mortgage, indenture, lease or other contract,
commitment, agreement, instrument, arrangement, understanding, obligation,
undertaking, permit, concession, franchise or license (each, a "Contract") to
which the Company or any of its subsidiaries is a party or any of their
respective properties or assets is subject or (iii) subject to the governmental
filings and other matters referred to in the following sentence, any (A)
statute, law, ordinance, rule or regulation or (B) judgment, order or decree, in
each case, applicable to the Company or any of its subsidiaries or their
respective properties or assets, other than, in the case of clauses (ii) and
(iii), any such conflicts, violations, breaches, defaults, rights, losses, Liens
or entitlements that individually or in the aggregate

could not reasonably be expected to (x) have a material adverse effect on the
Company, (y) impair in any material respect the ability of the Company to
perform its obligations under this Agreement or (z) prevent or materially
impede, interfere with, hinder or delay the consummation of any of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. No consent, approval, order or
authorization of, or registration, declaration or filing with, any domestic or
foreign governmental entity, including any Federal, state or local government or
any court, administrative agency or commission or other governmental or
regulatory authority or agency (each, a "Governmental Entity"), is required by
or with respect to the Company or any of its subsidiaries in connection with the
execution and delivery of this Agreement by the Company, the consummation by the
Company of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the compliance by
the Company with the provisions of this Agreement, except for (1) the filing of
a premerger notification and report form by the Company under the Hart-Scott-
Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended (the "HSR Act") or any
other applicable competition, merger control, antitrust or similar law, (2) the
filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") of a proxy
statement relating to the adoption of this Agreement by the Company's
stockholders (as amended or supplemented from time to time, the "Proxy
Statement") and such reports under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as
amended (the "Exchange Act"), as may be required in connection with this
Agreement, the Stockholders Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby
and thereby, (3) the filing of the Certificate of Merger with the Secretary of
State of the State of Delaware and appropriate documents with the relevant
authorities of other states in which the Company or any of its subsidiaries is

approvals, orders, authorizations, registrations, declarations and filings the
failure of which to be obtained or made individually or in the aggregate could
not reasonably be expected to (x) have a material adverse effect on the Company,
(y) impair in any material respect the ability of the Company to perform its
obligations under this Agreement or (z) prevent or materially impede, interfere
with, hinder or delay the consummation of any of the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement.

          (e)  SEC Documents.  The Company has filed with the SEC, and has
               --------------
heretofore made available to Parent true and complete copies of, all reports,
schedules, forms, statements and other documents required to be filed with the
SEC by the Company since July 26, 2000 (together with all

information incorporated therein by reference, the "SEC Documents"). No
subsidiary of the Company is required to file any form, report or other document
with the SEC. As of their respective dates, each of the SEC Documents complied
in all material respects with the requirements of the Securities Act of 1933, as
amended (the "Securities Act") or the Exchange Act, as the case may be, and the
rules and regulations of the SEC promulgated thereunder applicable to such SEC
Documents, and none of the SEC Documents at the time they were filed contained
any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements
therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not
misleading. As of the date of this Agreement, except to the extent that
information contained in any SEC Document filed and publicly available prior to
the date of this Agreement (a "Filed SEC Document") has been revised or
superseded by a later filed Filed SEC Document, none of the SEC Documents
contains any untrue statement of a material fact or omits to state a material
fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements
therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not
misleading. The financial statements (including the related notes) of the
Company included in the SEC Documents complied, when filed, or will comply, when
filed, in each case as to form in all material respects with applicable
accounting requirements and the published rules and regulations of the SEC with
respect thereto, have been or will be prepared in accordance with generally
accepted accounting principles ("GAAP") (except, in the case of unaudited
statements, as permitted by Form 10-Q of the SEC) applied on a consistent basis
during the periods involved (except as may be indicated in the notes thereto)
and fairly presented or will present in all material respects the consolidated
financial position of the Company and its consolidated subsidiaries as of the
dates thereof and their consolidated results of operations and cash flows for
the periods then ended (subject, in the case of unaudited statements, to normal
and recurring year-end audit adjustments and the absence of footnotes). Except
as set forth in the Filed SEC Documents, the Company and its subsidiaries have
no liabilities or obligations of any nature (whether accrued, absolute,
contingent or otherwise) that individually or in the aggregate could reasonably
be expected to have a material adverse effect on the Company.

          (f)  Information Supplied.  None of the information included  or
               ---------------------
incorporated by reference in the Proxy Statement will, at the date it is first
mailed to the Company's stockholders or at the time of the Stockholders Meeting
(as defined in Section 5.01) or at the time of any

amendment or supplement thereof, contain any untrue statement of a material fact
or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in
order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which
they are made, not misleading, except that no representation is made by the
Company with respect to statements made or incorporated by reference therein
based on information supplied by Parent or Sub specifically for inclusion or
incorporation by reference in the Proxy Statement. The Proxy Statement will
comply as to form in all material respects with the requirements of the Exchange
Act and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder.

          (g)  Absence of Certain Changes or Events.  Since the date of the most
               -------------------------------------

development, effect or occurrence that could reasonably be expected to result in
a material adverse effect on the Company, (ii) any declaration, setting aside or
payment of any dividend on, or other distribution (whether in cash, stock or

to its parent, (iii) any split, combination or reclassification of any of the
Company's or any of its subsidiaries' capital stock or any issuance or the
authorization of any issuance of any other securities in respect of, in lieu of

Company or any of its subsidiaries, (iv) (w) any granting by the Company or any
of its subsidiaries of any increase in compensation or fringe benefits, except
for normal increases of cash compensation prior to the date of this Agreement in
the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice, or any payment by

consistent with past practice, in each case to any current or former director,
officer, employee or consultant, (x) any granting by the Company or any of its
subsidiaries to any current or former director, officer, employee or consultant
of any increase in severance or termination pay, (y) any entry by the Company or
any of its subsidiaries into, or any amendment of, (A) any employment, deferred
compensation, severance, termination, indemnification or consulting agreement
between the Company or any of its subsidiaries, on the one hand, and any current
or former director, officer, employee or consultant of the Company or any of its

subsidiaries, on the other hand or (B) any agreement between the Company or any
of its subsidiaries, on the one hand, and any current or former director,
officer, employee or consultant of the Company or any of its subsidiaries, on
the other hand, the benefits of which are contingent, or the terms of which are
materially altered, upon the occurrence of a transaction involving the Company
of the nature contemplated by this Agreement or the Stockholders Agreement (all
such agreements under this clause (y), collectively, "Benefit Agreements"), or
(z) any amendment to, or modification of, any Stock Option, (v) any damage,
destruction or loss, whether or not covered by insurance, that individually or

on the Company, (vi) any change in financial or tax accounting methods,
principles or practices by the Company, except insofar as may have been required

Company of any of its material assets or (ix) any licensing or other agreement
with regard to the acquisition or disposition of any material Intellectual
Property (as defined in Section 3.01(p)) or rights thereto.

          (h)  Litigation.  There is no suit, claim, action, investigation or
               -----------
proceeding pending or, to the knowledge of the Company, threatened against or
affecting the Company or any of its subsidiaries that individually or in the
aggregate could reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on the
Company, nor is there any statute, law, ordinance, rule, regulation, judgment,
order or decree, of any Governmental Entity or arbitrator outstanding against,
or, to the knowledge of the Company, investigation by any Governmental Entity
involving, the Company or any of its subsidiaries that individually or in the
aggregate could reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on the
Company.

          (i)  Contracts.  None of the Company or any of its subsidiaries is a
               ----------
     party to or bound by, and none of their properties or assets are bound by
     or subject to, any written or oral:

     or any of its subsidiaries (other than employment agreements referred to in
     Section 3.01(k));

Each Contract of the Company and its subsidiaries is in full force and effect
and is a legal, valid and binding agreement of the Company or such subsidiary
and, to the knowledge of the Company or such subsidiary, of each other party
thereto, enforceable against the Company or any of its subsidiaries, as the case

thereto, in each case, in accordance with its terms, except for such failures to
be in full force and effect or enforceable that individually or in the aggregate
could not reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on the
Company. Each of the Company and its subsidiaries has performed or is performing
all material obligations required to be performed by it under its Contracts and
is not (with or without notice or lapse of time or both) in breach or default in
any material respect thereunder, and, to the knowledge of the Company or such
subsidiary, no other party to any of its Contracts is (with

or without notice or lapse of time or both) in breach or default in any material
respect thereunder except, in each case, for such breaches that individually or
in the aggregate could not reasonably be expected to have a material adverse
effect on the Company. Neither the Company nor any of its subsidiaries knows of
any circumstances that are reasonably likely to occur that could reasonably be
expected to materially adversely affect its ability to perform its obligations
under any material Contract.

          (j)  Compliance with Laws.  The Company and its subsidiaries are, and
               ---------------------
since December 31, 1998 have been, in compliance with all statutes, laws,
ordinances, rules, regulations, judgments, orders and decrees of any
Governmental Entity applicable to their businesses or operations, except for
instances of possible noncompliance that individually or in the aggregate could
not reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on the Company,
impair in any material respect the ability of the Company to perform its
obligations under this Agreement or prevent or materially impede, interfere
with, hinder or delay the consummation of any of the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement. None of the Company or any of its subsidiaries has received,
since December 31, 1998, a notice or other written communication alleging a
possible violation of any statute, law, ordinance, rule, regulation, judgment,
order or decree of any Governmental Entity applicable to its businesses or
operations, except for such violations that individually or in the aggregate
could not reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on the
Company. The Company and its subsidiaries have in effect all Federal, state and
local, domestic and foreign, governmental consents, approvals, orders,
authorizations, certificates, filings, notices, permits, concessions,
franchises, licenses and rights (collectively "Permits") necessary for them to
own, lease or operate their properties and assets and to carry on their
businesses as now conducted and there has occurred no violation of, or default
under, any such Permit, except for the lack of Permits and for violations of, or
defaults under, Permits, which lack of Permits, violations or defaults
individually or in the aggregate could not reasonably be expected to have a
material adverse effect on the Company. The Merger, in and of itself, could not
reasonably be expected to cause the revocation or cancelation of any such
Permit, which revocation or cancelation could reasonably be expected to have a
material adverse effect on the Company.

          (k)  Absence of Changes in Benefit Plans; Employment Agreements; Labor
               -----------------------------------------------------------------
Relations.  Except as disclosed in the Filed SEC Documents, since the date of
- ----------
the most

recent audited financial statements included in the Filed SEC Documents, none of
the Company or any of its subsidiaries has terminated, adopted, amended or
agreed to amend in any material respect any collective bargaining agreement or
any bonus, pension, profit sharing, deferred compensation, incentive
compensation, stock ownership, stock purchase, stock appreciation, restricted
stock, stock option, phantom stock, performance, retirement, thrift, savings,
stock bonus, paid time off, perquisite, fringe benefit, vacation, severance,
disability, death benefit, hospitalization, medical or other welfare benefit or
other material plan, program, arrangement or understanding (whether or not
legally binding) maintained, contributed to or required to be maintained or
contributed to by the Company or any other person or entity that, together with
the Company, is treated as a single employer under Section 414(b), (c), (m) or
(o) of the Code (each, a "Commonly Controlled Entity"), in each case providing
benefits to any current or former director, officer, employee or independent
contractor of the Company or any of its subsidiaries (collectively, "Benefit
Plans") or has made any material change in any actuarial or other assumption
used to calculate funding obligations with respect to any Benefit Plan that is a
Pension Plan (as defined in Section 3.01(m)), or any material change in the
manner in which contributions to any such Pension Plan are made or the basis on
which such contributions are determined. Except as disclosed in the Filed SEC
Documents, neither the Company nor any of its subsidiaries is party to any
Benefit Agreement. There are no collective bargaining or other labor union
agreements to which the Company or any of its subsidiaries is a party or by
which it is bound. Since December 31, 1998, neither the Company nor any of its
subsidiaries has encountered any labor union organizing activity, or had any
actual or threatened employee strikes, work stoppages, slowdowns or lockouts.

          (l)  Environmental Matters.  Except to the extent that the inaccuracy
               ----------------------
of any of the following (or the circumstances giving rise to such inaccuracy)
could not reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on the
Company, (i) the Company and each of its subsidiaries are in compliance with all
applicable Environmental Laws (as defined below); and (ii) there are no facts,
circumstances or conditions that are reasonably likely to give rise to any
liability of, or form the basis of a claim against, the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries in connection with any Environmental Law.  As used in this
Agreement, the term "Environmental Laws" shall mean any applicable Federal,
state or local, domestic or foreign, statutes, laws, regulations, ordinances,
rules, codes, enforceable

requirements, agreements, orders, decrees, judgments or injunctions issued,
promulgated or entered into by any Governmental Entity relating to protection of
the environment, natural resources or human health and safety. As used in this
Agreement, the term "Hazardous Substances" shall mean any explosive or
radioactive substances or materials, any toxic or hazardous substances or
materials, including asbestos or asbestos-containing materials, polychlorinated
biphenyls, petroleum and petroleum products, and any other substances or
materials regulated under any Environmental Law.

          (m)  ERISA Compliance.  (i)  Section 3.01(m)(i) of the Company
               -----------------
Disclosure Schedule contains a list of all Benefit Plans, including without
limitation each "employee welfare benefit plan" (as defined in Section 3(1) of
the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended "ERISA")) and
"employee pension benefit plan" (as defined in Section 3(2) of ERISA) (a
"Pension Plan").  The Company has provided or made available to Parent true,
complete and correct copies of (1) each Benefit Plan (or, in the case of any
unwritten Benefit Plans, descriptions thereof), (2) the two most recent annual
reports on Form 5500 required to be filed with the Internal Revenue Service (the
"IRS") with respect to each Benefit Plan (if any such report was required), (3)
the most recent summary plan description for each Benefit Plan for which such
summary plan description is required, (4) each trust agreement and group annuity
contract relating to any Benefit Plan and (5) the most recent IRS determination
letter for each Benefit Plan intended to be tax-qualified under Section 401(a)
of the Code.  Each Benefit Plan has been administered in accordance with its
terms, except where the failure so to be administered individually or in the
aggregate could not reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on
the Company.  The Company and its subsidiaries and all the Benefit Plans are in
compliance with all applicable provisions of ERISA, the Code, and all other
applicable laws, whether Federal, state or local, domestic or foreign, except
for instances of possible noncompliance that individually or in the aggregate
could not reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on the
Company. All Pension Plans intended to be tax-qualified have been the subject of
determination letters from the IRS to the effect that such Pension Plans are
qualified and exempt from United States Federal income taxes under Sections
401(a) and 501(a), respectively, of the Code; no such determination letter has
been revoked (or, to the knowledge of the Company, has revocation been
threatened) nor has any event occurred since the date of the most recent
determination letter or application therefor relating to any such Pension

Plan that would adversely affect the qualification of such Pension Plan or
materially increase the costs relating thereto or require security under Section
307 of ERISA.

          (ii)   Neither the Company nor any Commonly Controlled Entity has
     maintained, contributed to or been obligated to maintain or contribute to,
     or has any actual or contingent liability under, any Benefit Plan that is
     subject to Title IV of ERISA.

          (iii)  With respect to any Benefit Plan that is an employee welfare
     benefit plan (each, a "Welfare Plan"), there are no understandings,
     agreements or undertakings, written or oral, that would prevent any such
     plan (including any such plan covering retirees or other former employees)
     from being amended or terminated without material liability to the Company
     or any of its subsidiaries on or at any time after the Effective Time.  No
     Welfare Plan provides benefits after termination of employment except where
     the cost thereof is borne entirely by the former employee (or his eligible
     dependents or beneficiaries) or as required by Section 4980B(f) of the
     Code.  The Company and its subsidiaries comply in all material respects
     with the applicable requirements of Section 4980B(f) of the Code with
     respect to each Benefit Plan that is a group health plan, as such term is
     defined in Section 5000(b)(1) of the Code.

          (iv)   No current or former director, officer, employee or independent
     contractor of the Company or any of its subsidiaries will be entitled to
     any additional compensation or benefits or any acceleration of the time of
     payment or vesting of any compensation or benefits under any Benefit Plan
     or Benefit Agreement as a result of the transactions contemplated by this
     Agreement or the Stockholders Agreement or any benefits under any Benefit
     Plan or Benefit Agreement the value of which will be calculated on the
     basis of any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the
     Stockholders Agreement.

          (v)    All reports, returns and similar documents with respect to all
     Benefit Plans required to be filed with any Governmental Entity or
     distributed to any Benefit Plan participant have been duly and timely filed
     or distributed, except for failures to file or distribute that individually
     or in the aggregate have not had and could not reasonably be expected to
     have a material adverse effect on the Company.  The Company has received no
     notice of, and to the knowledge of the

     Company, there are no pending investigations by any Governmental Entity
     with respect to, or pending termination proceedings or other claims (except
     claims for benefits payable in the normal operation of the Benefit Plans),
     suits or proceedings against or involving any Benefit Plan or asserting any
     rights or claims to benefits under, any Benefit Plan that could give rise
     to any material liability, and, to the knowledge of the Company, there are
     not any facts that individually or in the aggregate have had or could
     reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on the Company.

          (vi)   All contributions, premiums and benefit payments under or in
     connection with the Benefit Plans that are required to have been made by
     the Company or any of its subsidiaries as of the date of this Agreement in
     accordance with the terms of the Benefit Plans have been timely made or
     have been reflected on the most recent consolidated balance sheet filed or
     incorporated by reference into the Filed Company SEC Documents.  No Pension
     Plan has an "accumulated funding deficiency" (as such term is defined in
     Section 302 of ERISA or Section 412 of the Code), whether or not waived.

          (vii)  With respect to each Benefit Plan, (A) there has not occurred
     any prohibited transaction in which the Company, any of its subsidiaries or
     any of their employees has engaged that could subject the Company, its
     subsidiaries or any of their employees, or, to the knowledge of the
     Company, a trustee, administrator or other fiduciary of any trust created
     under any Benefit Plan, to the tax or penalty on prohibited transactions
     imposed by Section 4975 of the Code or the sanctions imposed under Title I
     of ERISA, other than such taxes, penalties or sanctions that individually
     or in the aggregate could not reasonably be expected to result in a
     material liability and (B) neither the Company nor, to the knowledge of the
     Company, any trustee, administrator or other fiduciary of any Benefit Plan
     nor any agent of any of the foregoing has engaged in any transaction or
     acted in a manner that could, or failed to act so as to, subject the
     Company or, to the knowledge of the Company, any trustee, administrator or
     other fiduciary to any material liability for breach of fiduciary duty
     under ERISA or any other applicable law. No Benefit Plan or related trust
     has been terminated, nor has there been any "reportable event" (as that
     term is defined in Section 4043 of ERISA) for which the 30-day reporting
     requirement has not been waived with

     respect to any Benefit Plan during the last five years, and no notice of a
     reportable event will be required to be filed in connection with the
     transactions contemplated hereby.

          (viii)  The Company and its subsidiaries do not have any material
     liability or obligations, including under or on account of a Benefit Plan
     or Benefit Agreement, arising out of the hiring of persons to provide
     services to the Company or any of its subsidiaries and treating such
     persons as consultants or independent contractors and not as employees of
     the Company or its subsidiaries.

            (n)   Taxes.  (i)  Each of the Company and its subsidiaries and each
                  ------
Company Affiliated Group (as defined in clause (x) below) has timely filed all
Federal, state and local, domestic and foreign, income and franchise tax returns
and reports and all other tax returns and reports required to be filed by it and
all such returns and reports are complete and correct, except for such failures
to file or to be complete and correct that individually or in the aggregate
could not reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on the
Company.  Each of the Company and its subsidiaries and each Company Affiliated
Group has timely paid all taxes due with respect to the taxable periods covered
by such returns and reports and all other material taxes, except where the
failures so to pay individually or in the aggregate could not reasonably be
expected to have a material adverse effect on the Company, and the most recent
financial statements contained in the Filed SEC Documents reflect an adequate
reserve for all taxes payable by the Company and its subsidiaries for all
taxable periods and portions thereof through the date of such financial
statements.

            (ii)  No Federal, state or local, domestic or foreign, income or
     franchise tax return or report or any other material tax return or report
     of the Company or any of its subsidiaries or any Company Affiliated Group
     is currently under audit or examination by any taxing authority, and no
     written or, to the knowledge of the Company, unwritten notice of such an
     audit or examination has been received by the Company or any of its
     subsidiaries, except for such audits or examinations that individually or
     in the aggregate could not reasonably be expected to have a material
     adverse effect on the Company.  There is no deficiency, refund litigation,
     proposed adjustment or matter in controversy with respect to any taxes due
     and owing by the Company, any of its subsidiaries or any Company

     Affiliated Group, other than those that individually or in the aggregate
     could not reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on the
     Company. Each deficiency resulting from any audit or examination or any
     concluded litigation relating to taxes by any taxing authority has been
     timely paid, except where the failures so to pay individually or in the
     aggregate could not reasonably be expected to have a material adverse
     effect on the Company. No issues relating to taxes were raised by the
     relevant taxing authority during any presently pending audit or
     examination, and no issues relating to taxes were raised by the relevant
     taxing authority in any completed audit or examination that could
     reasonably be expected to recur in a later taxable period, in each case
     other than those that individually or in the aggregate could not reasonably
     be expected to have a material adverse effect on the Company. All
     assessments for taxes due and owing by the Company, any of its subsidiaries
     or any Company Affiliated Group with respect to completed and settled
     audits or examinations or concluded litigation have been paid. No Federal
     or state or other material local, domestic or foreign tax return or report
     of the Company or any of its subsidiaries or any Company Affiliated Group
     has ever been under audit or examination by any taxing authority. The
     relevant statute of limitations is closed with respect to the Federal tax
     returns of the Company and its subsidiaries for all years through December
     31, 1995.

          (iii)  There is no currently effective agreement or other document
     extending, or having the effect of extending, the period of assessment or
     collection of any material taxes, and no power of attorney with respect to
     any taxes has been executed or filed with any taxing authority.

          (iv)   No Liens for taxes exist with respect to any assets or
     properties of the Company or any of its subsidiaries, except for statutory
     Liens for taxes not yet due and any other Liens that individually or in the
     aggregate could not reasonably be expected to have a material adverse
     effect on the Company.

          (v)    None of the Company or any of its subsidiaries is a party to or
     bound by any tax sharing agreement, tax indemnity obligation or similar
     agreement, arrangement or practice with respect to taxes (including any
     advance pricing agreement, closing agreement or other agreement relating to
     taxes with any taxing authority).

          (vi)    None of the Company or any of its subsidiaries will be
     required to include in a taxable period ending after the Effective Time
     taxable income attributable to income that accrued in a prior taxable
     period but was not recognized in any prior taxable period as a result of
     the installment method of accounting, the completed contract method of
     accounting, the long-term contract method of accounting, the cash method of
     accounting or Section 481 of the Code or comparable provisions of state or
     local tax law, domestic or foreign, or for any other reason, except where
     the inclusions of such income in a taxable period ending after the
     Effective Time individually or in the aggregate could not reasonably be
     expected to have a material adverse effect on the Company.

          (vii)   Section 3.01(n)(vii) of the Company Disclosure Schedule sets
     forth for each employee of the Company who holds the title of vice
     president or above the compensation from the Company or any of its
     subsidiaries includible in such employee's gross income for each of the
     1996 through the 2000 calendar years.

          (viii)  The Company and its subsidiaries have complied with all
     applicable statutes, laws, ordinances, rules and regulations relating to
     the payment and withholding of taxes (including withholding of taxes
     pursuant to Sections 1441, 1442, 3121 and 3402 of the Code or similar
     provisions under any Federal, state or local, domestic or foreign, laws)
     and have, within the time and the manner prescribed by law, withheld from
     and paid over to the proper governmental authorities all amounts required
     to be so withheld and paid over under applicable laws, except where the
     failures so to comply, withhold and pay over individually or in the
     aggregate could not reasonably be expected to have a material adverse
     effect on the Company.

          (ix)    Neither the Company nor any of its subsidiaries has
     constituted either a "distributing corporation" or a "controlled
     corporation" in a distribution of stock qualifying for tax-free treatment
     under Section 355 of the Code (i) in the two years prior to the date of
     this Agreement or (ii) in a distribution that could otherwise constitute
     part of a "plan" or "series of related transactions" (within the meaning of
     Section 355(e) of the Code) in conjunction with the Merger.

          (x)    As used in this Agreement, "taxes" shall include all Federal,
     state and local, domestic and foreign, income, franchise, property, sales,
     excise, employment, payroll, social security, value-added, ad valorem,
     transfer, withholding and other taxes, including taxes based on or measured
     by gross receipts, profits, sales, use or occupation, tariffs, levies,
     impositions, assessments or governmental charges of any nature whatsoever,
     including any interest penalties or additions with respect thereto, and any
     obligations under any agreements or arrangements with any other person with
     respect to such amounts.  As used in this Agreement, "Company Affiliated
     Group" shall mean each affiliated, combined, consolidated or unitary group
     of which the Company or any of its subsidiaries is or has been a member.

          (o)    Title to Properties.  (i)  The Company and each of its
                 --------------------
subsidiaries has good and marketable title to, or valid leasehold interests in,
all of its material properties and assets except for such as are no longer used
or useful in the conduct of its businesses or as have been disposed of in the
ordinary course of business and except for defects in title, easements,
restrictive covenants and similar encumbrances that individually or in the
aggregate could not reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on
the Company.  All such material assets and properties, other than assets and
properties in which the Company or any of its subsidiaries has a leasehold
interest, are free and clear of all Liens, except for Liens that individually or
in the aggregate could not reasonably be expected to have a material adverse
effect on the Company.

          (ii)   Each of the Company and its subsidiaries has complied in all
     material respects with the terms of all material leases to which it is a
     party and under which it is in occupancy, and all such leases are in full
     force and effect, except for such instances of noncompliance or failures to
     be in full force and effect that individually or in the aggregate could not
     reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on the Company.
     The Company and its subsidiaries enjoy peaceful and undisturbed possession
     under all such material leases, except for failures to do so that
     individually or in the aggregate could not reasonably be expected to have a
     material adverse effect on the Company.

          (p)    Intellectual Property.  (i)  Section 3.01(p) of the Company
                 ----------------------
Disclosure Schedule lists all patents, patent applications, trademarks,
tradenames, service marks and

registered copyrights and applications therefor, if any, owned by or licensed to
the Company or any of its subsidiaries as of the date of this Agreement.
Attached to Section 3.01(p) of the Company Disclosure Schedule are true and
correct copies of all standard forms of license agreements relating to
Intellectual Property (as defined below in clause (iii)) of the Company or any
of its subsidiaries as of the date of this Agreement, and the Company has
provided to Parent true and correct copies of all license agreements relating to
Intellectual Property to which the Company or any of its subsidiaries is a party
that deviate from such standard forms in any material respect.

          (ii)  Except to the extent that the inaccuracy of any of the following
     (or the circumstances giving rise to such inaccuracy) could not reasonably
     be expected to have a material adverse effect on the Company:

                (A) the Company and each of its subsidiaries owns, or is
          licensed or otherwise has the right to use (in each case, free and
          clear of any Liens), all Intellectual Property used in or necessary to
          carry on its business as now being conducted;

                (B) none of the Company or any of its subsidiaries is infringing
          on or otherwise violating the rights of any person with regard to any
          Intellectual Property owned by, licensed to or otherwise used by the
          Company or any of its subsidiaries (provided, however, that with
                                              --------  -------
          respect to the foregoing as it relates to infringement by the Company
          of validly issued patents of third parties, such representation is
          limited to the knowledge of the Company);

                (C) there is no suit, claim, action, investigation or proceeding
          pending or, to the knowledge of the Company, threatened with respect
          to, and the Company has not been notified of, any possible
          infringement by the Company or any of its subsidiaries on or other
          violation of the rights of any person with regard to any Intellectual
          Property owned by, licensed to or otherwise used by the Company or any
          of its subsidiaries;

                (D) to the knowledge of the Company, no person is infringing on
          or otherwise violating any right of the Company or any of its
          subsidiaries with respect to any Intellectual Property owned by,
          licensed to and/or otherwise used by the Company or any of its
          subsidiaries;

               (E) to the knowledge of the Company, none of the former or
          current members of management or key personnel of the Company or any
          of its subsidiaries, including all former and current employees,
          agents, consultants and contractors who have contributed to or
          participated in the conception and development of the Intellectual
          Property of the Company or any of its subsidiaries, have a valid claim
          against the Company or any of its subsidiaries in connection with the
          involvement of such persons in the conception and development of any
          such Intellectual Property, and no such claim has been asserted or
          threatened;

               (F) the execution and delivery of this Agreement do not, and the
          consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and
          compliance with the provisions of this Agreement will not, conflict
          with, or result in any violation of, or default (with or without
          notice or lapse of time, or both) under, or give rise to any right,
          license or encumbrance relating to, Intellectual Property owned by the
          Company or any of its subsidiaries or with respect to which the
          Company or any of its subsidiaries now has or has had any agreement
          with any third party, or any right of termination, cancelation or
          acceleration of any material Intellectual Property right or obligation
          set forth in any agreement to which the Company or any of its
          subsidiaries is a party, or the loss or encumbrance of any
          Intellectual Property or benefit related thereto, or result in the
          creation of any Lien in or upon any Intellectual Property or right,
          other than under certain contracts and agreements, the material ones
          of which are set forth on Section 3.01(p) of the Company Disclosure
          Schedule, that provide for their termination upon a change of control
          of the Company;

               (G) except in the ordinary course of business consistent with
          past practice, no licenses or rights have been granted to distribute
          the source code of, or to use the source code to create Derivative
          Works (as defined below) of, any product currently marketed by,
          commercially available from or under development by the Company or any
          of its subsidiaries for which the Company possesses the source code;
          and

               (H) the Company and each of its subsidiaries has taken
          commercially reasonable and necessary steps to protect their
          Intellectual Property and their rights thereunder, and to the
          knowledge of the Company no such rights to Intellectual Property have
          been lost or are in jeopardy of being lost through failure to act by
          the Company or any of its subsidiaries.

               As used in this Agreement, "Derivative Work" shall mean a work
          that is based upon one or more preexisting works, such as a revision,
          enhancement, modification, abridgement, condensation, expansion or any
          other form in which such preexisting works may be recast, transformed
          or adapted, and which, if prepared without authorization of the owner
          of the copyright in such preexisting work, would constitute a
          copyright infringement.  As used in this Agreement, a Derivative Work
          shall also include any compilation that incorporates such a
          preexisting work as well as translation from one human language to
          another and from one type of code to another.

          (iii)  As used in this Agreement, "Intellectual Property" shall mean
     trademarks (registered or unregistered), service marks, brand names,
     certification marks, trade dress, assumed names, trade names and other
     indications of origin, the goodwill associated with the foregoing and
     registrations in any jurisdiction of, and applications in any jurisdiction
     to register, the foregoing, including any extension, modification or
     renewal of any such registration or application; inventions, discoveries
     and ideas, whether patented, patentable or not in any jurisdiction;
     computer programs and software (including source code, object code and
     data), know-how and any other technology; trade secrets and confidential
     information and rights in any jurisdiction to limit the use or disclosure
     thereof by any person; writings and other works, whether copyrighted,
     copyrightable or not in any jurisdiction; registration or applications for
     registration of copyrights in any jurisdiction, and any renewals or
     extensions thereof; any similar intellectual property or proprietary rights
     similar to any of the foregoing; licenses, immunities, covenants not to sue
     and the like relating to any of the foregoing; and any claims or causes of

          (a)  Organization.  Each of Parent and Sub is a corporation duly
               -------------
     organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the
     jurisdiction in which it is incorporated and has all requisite corporate
     power and authority to carry on its business as now being conducted.

          (b)  Authority; Noncontravention.  Parent and Sub have the requisite
               ----------------------------
     corporate power and authority to execute and deliver this Agreement, to

     Agreement by Parent and Sub, the consummation by Parent and Sub of the
     transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the compliance by Parent
     and Sub with the provisions of this Agreement have been duly authorized by
     all necessary corporate action on the part of Parent and Sub and no other

     execution and delivery by the Company, constitutes a valid and binding
     obligation of Parent and Sub, as applicable, enforceable against Parent and
     Sub, as applicable, in accordance with its terms (except insofar as
     enforceability may be limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency,
     reorganization, moratorium or similar laws affecting creditors' rights
     generally, or by principles governing the availability of equitable
     remedies).  The execution and delivery of this Agreement and the
     consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and
     compliance by Parent and Sub with the provisions of this Agreement do not
     and will not conflict with, or result in any violation or breach of, or
     default (with or without notice or lapse of time, or both) under, or give
     rise to a right of, or result in, termination, cancelation or acceleration
     of any obligation or to loss of a material benefit under, or result in the
     creation of any Lien in or upon any of

     the properties or assets of Parent or Sub under, or give rise to any
     increased, additional, accelerated or guaranteed rights or entitlements
     under, any provision of (i) the Certificate of Incorporation or By-laws of

     their respective properties or assets is subject or (iii) subject to the
     governmental filings and other matters referred to in the following
     sentence, any (A) statute, law, ordinance, rule or regulation or (B)
     judgment, order or decree, in each case, applicable to Parent or Sub or any
     of their respective properties or assets, other than, in the case of
     clauses (ii) and (iii), any such conflicts, violations, breaches, defaults,
     rights, losses, Liens or entitlements that individually or in the aggregate
     could not reasonably be expected to impair in any material respect the
     ability of each of Parent and Sub to perform its obligations under this
     Agreement or prevent or materially impede, interfere with, hinder or delay
     the consummation of any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.
     No consent, approval, order or authorization of, or registration,
     declaration or filing with, any Governmental Entity is required by or with
     respect to Parent or Sub in connection with the execution and delivery of
     this Agreement by Parent and Sub, the consummation by Parent and Sub of the
     transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the compliance by Parent or

     filing of the Certificate of Merger with the Secretary of State of the
     State of Delaware and appropriate documents with the relevant authorities

     qualified to do business and (3) such other consents, approvals, orders,
     authorizations, registrations, declarations and filings the failure of
     which to be obtained or made individually or in the aggregate could not
     reasonably be expected to impair in any material respect the ability of
     each of Parent and Sub to perform its obligations under this Agreement or
     prevent or materially impede, interfere with, hinder or delay the
     consummation of any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

          (c)  Information Supplied.  None of the information supplied or to be
               ---------------------
     supplied by Parent or Sub specifically for inclusion or incorporation by
     reference in the Proxy Statement will (except to the

     extent revised or superseded by amendments or supplements contemplated
     hereby), at the date the Proxy Statement is first mailed to the Company's
     stockholders or at the time of Stockholders Meeting, contain any untrue
     statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to
     be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in
     light of the circumstances under which they are made, not misleading.

               --------------------------

its Board of Directors or any committee thereof take, agree or resolve to take
any action prohibited by Section 4.02(b).

agrees that its obligations pursuant to this Section 5.01(b) shall not be
affected by the commencement, public proposal, public disclosure or
communication to the Company or any other person of any Takeover Proposal.

          SECTION 5.02.  Access to Information; Confidentiality.  The Company
                         --------------------------------------
shall, and shall cause each of its subsidiaries to, afford to Parent, and to
Parent's officers, employees, investment bankers, attorneys, accountants and
other advisors and representatives, reasonable access during normal business
hours during the period prior to the Effective Time or the termination of this
Agreement to all their respective properties, books, contracts, commitments,
directors, officers, attorneys, accountants, auditors (and, to the extent within
the Company's control, former auditors), other advisors and representatives and
records and, during such period, the Company shall, and shall cause each of its
subsidiaries to, make available to Parent (a) a copy of each report, schedule,
form, statement and other document filed or received by it during such period
pursuant

to the requirements of Federal, state or local, domestic or foreign, laws and
(b) all other information concerning its business, properties and personnel as
Parent may reasonably request (including the work papers of
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP). Except as required by law, Parent will hold, and
will direct its officers, employees, investment bankers, attorneys, accountants
and other advisors and representatives to hold, any and all information received
from the Company, directly or indirectly, in confidence in accordance with the
Confidentiality Agreement.

          SECTION 5.03.  Reasonable Best Efforts; Notification.  (a)  Upon the
                         --------------------------------------
terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, each of the
parties agrees to use its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken,
all actions, that are necessary, proper or advisable to consummate and make
effective the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement
and the Stockholders Agreement, including using its reasonable best efforts to
accomplish the following: (i) the taking of all reasonable acts necessary to
cause the conditions precedent set forth in Article VI to be satisfied, (ii) the
obtaining of all necessary actions or nonactions, waivers, consents, approvals,
orders and authorizations from Governmental Entities and the making of all
necessary registrations, declarations and filings (including registrations,
declarations and filings with Governmental Entities, if any), (iii) the taking
of all reasonable steps as may be necessary to avoid any suit, claim, action,
investigation or proceeding by an Governmental Entity and (iv) the obtaining of
all necessary consents, approvals or waivers from third parties. In connection
with and without limiting the foregoing, the Company and its Board of Directors
shall, if any state takeover statute or similar statute or regulation is or
becomes applicable to this Agreement, the Stockholders Agreement, the Merger or
any of the other transactions contemplated hereby or thereby, use their
reasonable best efforts to ensure that the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated hereby or thereby may be consummated as promptly as practicable on
the terms contemplated by this Agreement and otherwise to minimize the effect of
such statute or regulation on this Agreement, the Stockholders Agreement, the
Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby or thereby.
Notwithstanding the foregoing or any other provision of this Agreement to the
contrary, in no event shall any party hereto be obligated to (A) agree to, or
proffer to, divest or hold separate, or enter into any licensing or similar
arrangement with respect to, any assets (whether tangible or intangible) or any
portion of any business of Parent, the Company or any of their respective
subsidiaries or (B)

litigate any suit, claim, action, investigation or proceeding, whether judicial
or administrative, (1) challenging or seeking to restrain or prohibit the
consummation of the Merger; (2) seeking to prohibit or limit in any material
respect the ownership or operation by the Company, Parent or any of their
respective affiliates of a material portion of the business or assets of the
Company and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or Parent and its subsidiaries,
taken as a whole, or to require any such person to dispose of or hold separate
any material portion of the business or assets of the Company and its
subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or Parent and its subsidiaries, taken as a
whole, as a result of the Merger; or (3) seeking to prohibit Parent or any of
its affiliates from effectively controlling in any material respect a
substantial portion of the business or operations of the Company or its
subsidiaries. The Company and Parent will provide such assistance, information
and cooperation to each other as is reasonably required to obtain any such
nonactions, waivers, consents, approvals, orders and authorizations and, in
connection therewith, will notify the other person promptly following the
receipt of any comments from any Governmental Entity for amendments, supplements
or additional information in respect of any registration, declaration or filing
with such Governmental Entity and will supply the other person with copies of
all correspondence between such person or any of its representatives, on the one
hand, and any Governmental Entity, on the other hand.

          (b)  The Company shall give prompt notice to Parent of any
representation or warranty made by it contained in this Agreement becoming
untrue or inaccurate such that the condition set forth in Section 6.02(a) would
not be satisfied; provided, however, that no such notification shall affect the
                  --------  -------
representations, warranties, covenants or agreements of the parties or the
conditions to the obligations of the parties under this Agreement.

          (c)  Parent shall give prompt notice to the Company of any
representation or warranty made by it or Sub contained in this Agreement
becoming untrue or inaccurate such that the condition set forth in Section
6.03(a) would not be satisfied; provided, however, that no such notification
                                --------  -------
shall affect the representations, warranties, covenants or agreements of the
parties or the conditions to the obligations of the parties under this
Agreement.

          (d)  Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Company
shall give Parent the opportunity to participate in the defense of any
litigation against the Company and/or its directors relating to the transactions

contemplated by this Agreement at the sole expense of Parent.

          SECTION 5.04.  Stock Options.  (a) As soon as practicable following
                         --------------
the date of this Agreement, the Board of Directors of the Company (or, if
appropriate, any committee administering the Company Stock Plans) shall adopt
such resolutions or take such other actions (if any) as may be required to
effect the following:

          (i)  adjust the terms of all outstanding Stock Options (other than
     Non-Employee Options (as defined below)), whether vested or unvested, as
     necessary to provide that, at the Effective Time, each such Stock Option
     outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into
     an option to acquire, on the same terms and conditions as were applicable
     under such Stock Option, the number of shares of Parent common stock, par
     value $0.20 per share ("Parent Common Stock") (rounded down to the nearest
     whole share), determined by multiplying the number of shares of Company
     Common Stock subject to such Stock Option by a fraction (the "Option
     Exchange Ratio"), the numerator of which is the Merger Consideration and
     the denominator of which is the average closing price of Parent Common
     Stock on the New York Stock Exchange Composite Transactions Tape on the ten
     trading days immediately preceding the date on which the Effective Time
     occurs, at an exercise price per share of Parent Common Stock equal to (A)
     the per share exercise price for the shares of Company Common Stock
     otherwise purchasable pursuant to such Stock Option divided by (B) the
     Option Exchange Ratio (each, as so adjusted, an "Adjusted Option"),
     provided that such exercise price shall be rounded up to the nearest whole
     --------
     cent;

          (ii) adjust the terms of all outstanding Stock Options held by
     individuals other than current or former employees of the Company ("Non-
     Employee Options"), whether vested or unvested, as necessary to provide
     that at the Effective Time, each Non-Employee Option outstanding
     immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be canceled and converted
     into the right to receive an amount of cash equal to the excess, if any, of
     (A) the product of (1) the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject
     to such Non-Employee Option and (2) the Merger Consideration, over (B) the
     product of (1) the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such
     Non-Employee Option and (2) the per share exercise price of such Non-
     Employee Option; and

        (iii)  make such other changes to the Company Stock Plans as Parent and
     the Company may agree are appropriate to give effect to the Merger.

          (b)  The adjustments provided herein with respect to any Stock Options
that are "incentive stock options" as defined in Section 422 of the Code shall
be and are intended to be effected in a manner which is consistent with Section
424(a) of the Code.

          (c)  At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without the
need of any further corporate action, Parent shall assume the Company Stock
Plans, with the result that all obligations of the Company under the Company
Stock Plans, including with respect to Stock Options outstanding at the
Effective Time, shall be obligations of Parent following the Effective Time.

          (d)  As soon as practicable after the Effective Time, Parent shall
prepare and file with the SEC a registration statement on Form S-8 (or another
appropriate form) registering a number of shares of Parent Common Stock equal to
the number of shares subject to the Adjusted Options.  Such registration
statement shall be kept effective (and the current status of the prospectus or
prospectuses required thereby shall be maintained) as long as any Adjusted
Options may remain outstanding.

          (e)  As soon as practicable after the Effective Time, Parent shall
deliver to the holders of Stock Options (other than Non-Employee Options)
appropriate notices setting forth such holders' rights pursuant to the
respective Company Stock Plans and the agreements evidencing the grants of such
Stock Options and that such Stock Options and agreements shall be assumed by
Parent and shall continue in effect on the same terms and conditions (subject to
the adjustments required by this Section 5.04 after giving effect to the
Merger).

          (f)  A holder of an Adjusted Option may exercise such Adjusted Option
in whole or in part in accordance with its terms by delivering a properly
executed notice of exercise to Parent, together with the consideration therefor
and the Federal withholding tax information, if any, required in accordance with
the related Company Stock Plan.

          (g)  Except as otherwise contemplated by this Section 5.04 and except
to the extent required under the respective terms of the Stock Options or
Company Stock Plans, all restrictions or limitations on transfer and vesting
with respect to Stock Options awarded under the

Company Stock Plans or any other plan, program or arrangement of the Company, to
the extent that such restrictions or limitations shall not have already lapsed,
shall remain in full force and effect with respect to such options after giving
effect to the Merger and the assumption by Parent as set forth above.

          SECTION 5.05.  Indemnification, Exculpation and Insurance.  (a) Parent
                         -------------------------------------------
and Sub agree that all rights to indemnification and exculpation from
liabilities for acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time
(and rights for advancement of expenses) now existing in favor of the current or
former directors or officers of the Company and its subsidiaries as provided in
their respective certificates of incorporation or by-laws (or comparable
organizational documents) and any indemnification or other agreements of the
Company as in effect on the date of this Agreement shall be assumed by the
Surviving Corporation in the Merger, without further action, at the Effective
Time and shall survive the Merger and shall continue in full force and effect in
accordance with their terms, and Parent shall ensure that the Surviving
Corporation complies with and honors the foregoing obligations.

          (b)  In the event that the Surviving Corporation or any of its
successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other person and
is not the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation
or merger or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially all its properties
and assets to any person, or if Parent otherwise dissolves the Surviving
Corporation, then, and in each such case, Parent shall cause proper provision to
be made so that the successors and assigns of the Surviving Corporation assume
the obligations set forth in this Section 5.05.

          (c)  For six years after the Effective Time, Parent shall maintain in
effect the Company's current directors' and officers' liability insurance
covering each person currently covered by the Company's directors' and officers'
liability insurance policy for acts or omissions occurring prior to the
Effective Time on terms with respect to such coverage and amounts no less
favorable than those of such policy in effect on the date of this Agreement;
provided that Parent may substitute therefor policies of a reputable insurance
- --------
company the material terms of which, including coverage and amount, are no less
favorable to such directors and officers than the insurance coverage otherwise
required under this Section 5.05(c); provided, however, that in no event shall
                                     --------  -------
Parent be required to pay aggregate premiums for insurance under this Section
5.05(c) in excess

of 200% of the amount of the aggregate premiums paid by the Company in 2001 on
an annualized basis for such purpose (which 2001 annualized premiums are hereby
represented and warranted by the Company to be $333,580) (the "Maximum
Premium"), provided that Parent shall nevertheless be obligated to provide such
           --------
coverage as may be obtained for such 200% amount. If the existing or substituted
directors' and officers' liability insurance expires or is terminated or
canceled during such six-year period, Parent will obtain as much directors' and
officers' liability insurance as can be obtained for the remainder of such
period for an annualized premium not in excess of the Maximum Premium.

          (d)  The provisions of this Section 5.05 (i) are intended to be for
the benefit of, and will be enforceable by, each indemnified party, his or her
heirs and his or her representatives and (ii) are in addition to, and not in
substitution for, any other rights to indemnification or contribution that any
such person may have by contract or otherwise.

          SECTION 5.06.  Fees and Expenses.  All fees and expenses incurred in
                         ------------------
connection with this Agreement, the Stockholder Agreement, the Merger and the
other transactions contemplated hereby and thereby shall be paid by the party
incurring such fees or expenses, whether or not the Merger is consummated.

          SECTION 5.07.  Employee Matters.  (a)  Following the Effective Time,
                         -----------------
the Surviving Corporation shall honor, or cause to be honored, all obligations
of the Company and its subsidiaries under Benefit Agreements and Benefit Plans
in accordance with the terms thereof.  Nothing herein shall be construed to
prohibit the Surviving Corporation from amending or terminating such Benefit
Agreements and Benefit Plans in accordance with the terms thereof and with
applicable law or from terminating the employment of any employee of the Company
or its subsidiaries at any time following the Effective Time.

          (b)  The Company shall amend the ESPP on the date of this Agreement to
provide that (i) participants may not increase their payroll deductions or
purchase elections from those in effect on the date of this Agreement, (ii) no
offering periods shall be commenced after the date of this Agreement, (iii) each
participant's outstanding right to purchase shares of Company Common Stock under
the ESPP shall terminate immediately prior to the Effective Time in exchange for
a cash payment in an amount equal to the excess, if any, of (A) the product of
(1) the number of shares of Company Common Stock that could have been

purchased with such participant's accumulated payroll deductions immediately
prior to the Effective Time (the "Applicable ESPP Shares") at the applicable
option price determined in accordance with the terms of the ESPP (the
"Applicable ESPP Price") and (2) the Merger Consideration, over (B) the product
of the number of Applicable ESPP Shares and the Applicable ESPP Price and (iv)
the ESPP shall terminate at the Effective Time.

          SECTION 5.08.  Public Announcements.  Parent and Sub, on the one hand,
                         ---------------------
and the Company, on the other hand, will, to the extent reasonably practicable,
consult with each other before issuing, and give each other a reasonable
opportunity to review and comment upon, any press release or other public
statements with respect to this Agreement, the Stockholders Agreement, the
Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby and thereby, and shall not
issue any such press release or make any such public statement prior to such
consultation, except as may be required by applicable law, court process or by
obligations pursuant to any listing agreement with any national securities
exchange or national securities quotation system. The parties agree that the
initial press releases to be issued by Parent and the Company with respect to
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the Stockholders Agreement
shall be in a form agreed to by the parties.

          SECTION 5.09.  Closing Date Balance Sheet.  The Company shall prepare
                         ---------------------------
and deliver to Parent prior to Closing (i) an unaudited consolidated balance
sheet of the Company as of the last business day of the most recently completed
full month ending immediately preceding the Closing Date (or, if the Closing
Date is before the 15th day of the month, as of the last business day of the
month immediately preceding the most recently completed full month ending
immediately preceding the Closing Date), which balance sheet shall be prepared
in accordance with GAAP (except as permitted by Form 10-Q of the SEC) and on a
basis consistent with the unaudited balance sheets of the Company included in
the SEC Documents and shall fairly present in all material respects the
consolidated financial position of the Company and its consolidated subsidiaries
as of the date thereof, and (ii) the Company's best estimate (using actual data
through at least the end of the third business day immediately preceding the
Closing Date) of closing account information for all line items that would
appear on a consolidated balance sheet of the Company other than deferred
revenue and line items relating to stockholders' equity (deficit) as of the
business day immediately preceding the Closing Date.  The Company shall provide
to

Parent any information and back-up materials (including bank account
information) reasonably requested by Parent with respect thereto.

4.01(d) the last sentence of Section 5.02, Section 5.06, this Section 7.02 and

                         STOCKHOLDERS AGREEMENT dated as of April 19, 2001 (this
                    "Agreement"), among INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS MACHINES
                    CORPORATION, a New York corporation ("Parent"), and the
                    individuals and other parties listed on Schedule A attached
                    hereto (each, a "Stockholder" and, collectively, the
                    "Stockholders").

               WHEREAS Parent, Waterfall Acquisition Corp., a Delaware
     corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent ("Sub"), and
     Mainspring, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the "Company"), propose to enter
     into an Agreement and Plan of Merger dated as of the date hereof (as the

     not defined herein shall have the meanings set forth in the Merger
     Agreement) providing for the merger of Sub with and into the Company (the
     "Merger") upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the
     Merger Agreement;

               WHEREAS each Stockholder owns the number of shares of capital
     stock of the Company set forth opposite such Stockholder's name on Schedule
     A hereto (such shares of capital stock of the Company being referred to
     herein as such Stockholder's "Original Shares"; the Original Shares,
     together with any other shares of capital stock of the Company or other
     voting securities of the Company acquired by such Stockholder after the

     and

               WHEREAS, as a condition to its willingness to enter into the
     Merger Agreement, Parent has required that each Stockholder enter into this
     Agreement.

               NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the
     representations, warranties, covenants and agreements set forth herein and
     in the Merger Agreement, the parties hereto agree as follows:

               SECTION 1.  Representations and Warranties of Each Stockholder.
                           ---------------------------------------------------
     Each Stockholder hereby, severally and not jointly, represents and warrants
     to Parent as follows:

               (a)  Organization; Authority; Execution and Delivery;
                    ------------------------------------------------
     Enforceability.  With respect to each Stockholder that is not a natural
     ---------------
     person, such Stockholder (i) is duly organized, validly existing and in
     good standing under the laws of its jurisdiction of organization and (ii)
     has the requisite corporate, company or partnership power and authority to
     execute and deliver this Agreement, to consummate the transactions
     contemplated by this Agreement and to comply with the provisions of this
     Agreement.  The execution and delivery of this Agreement by each
     Stockholder that is not a natural person, the consummation by such
     Stockholder of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the
     compliance by such Stockholder with the provisions of this Agreement have
     been duly authorized by all necessary corporate or other comparable action
     on the part of such Stockholder and no other corporate or other comparable
     proceedings on the part of such Stockholder are necessary to authorize this
     Agreement or to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.
     This Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by such Stockholder
     and, assuming the due authorization, execution and delivery by Parent,
     constitutes a valid and binding obligation of such Stockholder, enforceable
     against such Stockholder in accordance with its terms.  With respect to
     each Stockholder that is a natural person and whose Subject Shares
     constitute community property or otherwise need spousal or other approval
     for this Agreement to be legal, valid and binding, this Agreement has been
     duly executed and delivered by, and constitutes a valid and binding
     obligation of, such Stockholder's spouse, enforceable against such spouse
     in accordance with its terms.  The execution and delivery of this Agreement
     and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby and compliance
     by such Stockholder with the provisions hereof do not and will not conflict
     with, or result in any violation or breach of, or default (with or without
     notice or lapse of time, or both) under, or give rise to a right of, or
     result in, termination, cancelation or acceleration of any obligation or to
     loss of a material benefit under, or result in the creation of any Lien in
     or upon any of the properties or assets of such Stockholder under, or give
     rise to any increased, additional, accelerated or guaranteed rights or
     entitlements under, any provision of (i) with respect to each Stockholder
     that is not a natural person, the certificate of incorporation or by-laws,
     partnership agreement or limited liability company agreement (or similar
     organizational documents) of such Stockholder, (ii) any Contract to which
     such Stockholder is a party or any of the properties or assets of such
     Stockholder is subject or (iii) subject to the governmental filings and
     other matters referred to in the following

     sentence, any (A) statute, law, ordinance, rule or regulation or (B)
     judgment, order or decree, in each case, applicable to such Stockholder or
     its properties or assets, other than, in the case of clauses (ii) and
     (iii), any such conflicts, violations, breaches, defaults, rights, losses,
     Liens or entitlements that individually or in the aggregate could not
     reasonably be expected to impair in any material respect the ability of
     such Stockholder to perform its obligations under this Agreement or prevent
     or materially impede, interfere with, hinder or delay the consummation of
     any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. No consent,
     approval, order or authorization of, or registration, declaration or filing
     with, any Governmental Entity is required by or with respect to such
     Stockholder in connection with the execution and delivery of this Agreement
     by such Stockholder, the consummation by such Stockholder of the
     transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the compliance by such
     Stockholder with the provisions of this Agreement, except for (1) filings
     under the HSR Act and any other applicable competition, merger control,
     antitrust or similar law, (2) filings with the SEC of such reports under
     the Exchange Act as may be required in connection with this Agreement and
     the transactions contemplated hereby and (3) such other consents,
     approvals, orders, authorizations, registrations, declarations and filings
     the failure of which to be obtained or made individually or in the
     aggregate could not reasonably be expected to impair in any material
     respect the ability of such Stockholder to perform its obligations under
     this Agreement or prevent or materially impede, interfere with, hinder or
     delay the consummation of any of the transactions contemplated by this
     Agreement. With respect to each Stockholder that is a trustee under a
     trust, no such trust requires any consent that has not been obtained of any
     beneficiary to the execution and delivery of this Agreement or to the
     consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby.

               (b)  The Subject Shares.  Such Stockholder has good and
                    -------------------
     marketable title to the Subject Shares of such Stockholder set forth
     opposite its name on Schedule A hereto, free and clear of any Liens.  Other
     than as set forth on Schedule A hereto, such Stockholder does not own (of
     record or beneficially) any shares of capital stock of the Company or any
     options, warrants, rights or other similar instruments to acquire any
     capital stock or other voting securities of the Company.  Such Stockholder
     has the sole right to vote and Transfer (as defined in Section 3(c)) the
     Subject Shares set forth opposite its name on Schedule A hereto, and none
     of such Subject Shares is subject to any voting trust or other agreement,
     arrangement or restriction with respect to the voting or the Transfer of
     such Subject Shares that would in any way limit the ability of such
     Stockholder to perform its obligations under this Agreement.

               SECTION 2.  Representations and Warranties of Parent.  Parent
                           -----------------------------------------
     hereby represents and warrants to the Stockholders as follows:  Parent has
     the requisite corporate power and authority to execute and deliver this
     Agreement, to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
     and to comply with the provisions of this Agreement.  The execution and
     delivery of this Agreement by Parent, the consummation by Parent of the
     transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the compliance by Parent
     with the provisions of this Agreement have been duly authorized by all
     necessary corporate action on the part of Parent and no other corporate
     proceedings on the part of Parent are necessary to authorize this Agreement
     or to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.  This
     Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by Parent and, assuming the
     due authorization (with respect to each Stockholder that is not a natural
     person), execution and delivery by each Stockholder, constitutes a valid
     and binding obligation of Parent, enforceable against Parent in accordance
     with its terms.  The execution and delivery of this Agreement and the
     consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and
     compliance by Parent with the provisions of this Agreement do not and will
     not conflict with, or result in any violation or breach of, or default
     (with or without notice or lapse of time, or both) under, or give rise to a
     right of, or result in, termination, cancelation or acceleration of any
     obligation or to loss of a material benefit under, or result in the
     creation of any Lien in or upon any of the properties or assets of Parent
     under, or give rise to any increased, additional, accelerated or guaranteed
     rights or entitlements under, any provision of (i) the Certificate of
     Incorporation or By-laws of Parent, (ii) any Contract to which Parent is a
     party or any of its properties or assets is subject or (iii) subject to the
     governmental filings and other matters referred to in the following
     sentence, any (A) statute, law, ordinance, rule or regulation or (B)
     judgment, order or decree, in each case, applicable to Parent or its
     properties or assets, other than, in the case of clauses (ii) and (iii),
     any such conflicts, violations, breaches, defaults, rights, losses, Liens
     or entitlements that individually or in the aggregate could not reasonably
     be expected to impair in any material respect the ability of Parent to
     perform its obligations under this Agreement or prevent or materially
     impede, interfere with, hinder or delay the consummation of any of the
     transactions contemplated by this Agreement.  No consent, approval, order
     or authorization of, or registration, declaration or filing with, any
     Governmental Entity is required by or with respect to Parent in connection
     with the execution and delivery of this Agreement by Parent, the
     consummation by Parent of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
     or the compliance by Parent with the provisions of this Agreement, except
     for (1) filings under the HSR Act and any other applicable

     competition, merger control, antitrust or similar law, (2) filings with the
     SEC of such reports under the Exchange Act as may be required in connection
     with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby and (3) such
     other consents, approvals, orders, authorizations, registrations,
     declarations and filings the failure of which to be obtained or made
     individually or in the aggregate could not reasonably be expected to impair
     in any material respect the ability of Parent to perform its obligations
     under this Agreement or prevent or materially impede, interfere with,
     hinder or delay the consummation of any of the transactions contemplated by
     this Agreement. Any Subject Shares purchased by Parent pursuant to this
     Agreement will be acquired for investment purposes only and not with a view
     to any public distribution thereof, and Parent shall not offer to sell or
     otherwise dispose of any Subject Shares so acquired by it in violation of
     any of the registration or prospectus delivery requirements of the
     Securities Act.

               SECTION 3.  Covenants of Each Stockholder.  Each Stockholder,
                           ------------------------------
     severally and not jointly, covenants and agrees as follows:

               (a)  At any meeting of the stockholders of the Company called to
     vote upon the Merger Agreement, the Merger or any of the other transactions
     contemplated by the Merger Agreement, or at any adjournment thereof, or in
     any other circumstances upon which a vote, consent, adoption or other
     approval (including by written consent) with respect to the Merger
     Agreement, the Merger or any of the other transactions contemplated by the
     Merger Agreement is sought, such Stockholder shall vote (or cause to be
     voted) all the Subject Shares of such Stockholder in favor of, and shall
     consent to (or cause to be consented to), the adoption of the Merger
     Agreement and the approval of the terms thereof and of the Merger and each
     of the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement.

               (b)  At any meeting of the stockholders of the Company or at any
     adjournment thereof or in any other circumstances upon which a vote,
     consent, adoption or other approval (including by written consent) is
     sought, such Stockholder shall vote (or cause to be voted) all the Subject
     Shares of such Stockholder against, and shall not consent to (and shall
     cause not to be consented to), any of the following:  (i) any Takeover
     Proposal or (ii) any amendment of the Company's Certificate of
     Incorporation or By-laws or other proposal, action or transaction involving
     the Company or any of its subsidiaries or any of its stock holders, which
     amendment or other proposal, action or transaction would prevent or delay
     the consummation of the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by
     the Merger Agreement or this Agreement or change in any manner the voting
     rights of the Company Common Stock (collectively,

     "Frustrating Transactions"). Such stockholders shall not commit to or agree
     to take any action inconsistent with the foregoing or that would otherwise
     facilitate a Frustrating Transaction.

               (c)  Such Stockholder shall not (i) sell, transfer, pledge,
     assign or otherwise dispose of (including by gift) (collectively,
     "Transfer"), or consent to or permit any Transfer of, any Subject Shares or
     any interest therein, or enter into any Contract, option or other
     arrangement with respect to the Transfer (including any profit sharing or
     other derivative arrangement) of any Subject Shares or any interest
     therein, to any person other than pursuant to this Agreement or the Merger
     Agreement, unless prior to any such Transfer the transferee of such Subject
     Shares enters into a stockholder agreement with Parent on terms
     substantially identical to the terms of this Agreement or (ii) enter into
     any voting arrangement, whether by proxy, voting agreement or otherwise,
     with respect to its vote, consent or other approval sought in connection
     with the adoption by the stockholders of the Company of the Merger
     Agreement or the approval of the Merger or the other transactions
     contemplated by the Merger Agreement (and if entered into or executed, any
     such voting arrangement, voting agreement or other agreement shall not be
     effective), and shall not commit or agree to take any of the foregoing
     actions, other than pursuant to this Agreement.  Such Stockholder shall
     not, nor shall such Stockholder permit any entity under such Stockholder's
     control to, deposit any Subject Shares in a voting trust.

               (d)  Each Stockholder hereby grants to Parent an irrevocable
     option to purchase any or all the Subject Shares of such Stockholder, at
     any time or from time to time after a Takeover Proposal has been made, for
     a purchase price equal to $4.00 per share in cash (the "Parent Option
     Price").

               (e)  Such Stockholder shall not, nor shall such Stockholder
     permit any of its subsidiaries to, or authorize or permit any director,
     officer, employee or general partner of such Stockholder or any of its
     subsidiaries, or any investment banker, attorney, accountant or other
     advisor or representative of such Stockholder or any of its subsidiaries
     to, directly or indirectly, (i) solicit, initiate or encourage, or take any
     other action knowingly to facilitate, any Takeover Proposal or other
     Frustrating Transaction or any inquiries or the making of any proposal that
     constitutes a Takeover Proposal or other Frustrating Transaction, (ii)
     enter into any agreement with respect to any Takeover Proposal or other
     Frustrating Transaction or (iii) enter into, continue or otherwise
     participate in any discussions or negotiations regarding, or furnish to any
     person any information with respect to, or otherwise

     cooperate in any way with, or assist or participate in any effort or
     attempt by any person with respect to, any Takeover Proposal or other
     Frustrating Transaction. Without limiting the foregoing, it is understood
     that any violation in any material respect of the restrictions set forth in
     the preceding sentence by any director, officer, employee or general
     partner of, or any investment banker, attorney, accountant or other advisor
     or representative of such Stockholder or any of its subsidiaries, whether
     or not such Person is purporting to act on behalf of such Stockholder,
     shall be deemed to be a violation of this Section 3(e) by such Stockholder.
     Such Stockholder shall promptly advise Parent orally and in writing of any
     Takeover Proposal or inquiry made to such Stockholder with respect to any
     Takeover Proposal or other Frustrating Transaction.

               (f)  Such Stockholder shall not, nor shall such Stockholder
     permit any of its subsidiaries to, or authorize or permit any director,
     officer, employee or general partner of such Stockholder or any of its
     subsidiaries or any investment banker, attorney, accountant or other
     advisor or representative of such Stockholder or any of its subsidiaries
     to, directly or indirectly, issue any press release or make any other
     public statement with respect to the Merger Agreement, this Agreement, the
     Merger or any of the other transactions contemplated by the Merger
     Agreement or this Agreement without the prior written consent of Parent,
     except as may be required by applicable law.

               (g)  Such Stockholder hereby consents to and approves the actions
     taken by the Board of Directors of the Company in approving the Merger
     Agreement and this Agreement, the Merger and the other transactions
     contemplated by the Merger Agreement.  Such Stockholder hereby waives, and
     agrees not to exercise or assert, any appraisal or similar rights under
     Section 262 of the DGCL or other applicable law in connection with the
     Merger.

               SECTION 4.  Grant of Irrevocable Proxy; Appointment of Proxy.
                           -------------------------------------------------
     (a)  Each Stockholder, during the term of this Agreement, hereby
     irrevocably grants to, and appoints, Parent and David S. Hershberg, its
     Vice President--Assistant General Counsel, Andrew Bonzani, its Assistant
     Secretary and Senior Counsel and David L. Johnson, its Vice President of
     Corporate Development, in their respective capacities as designees of
     Parent, and any individual who shall hereafter succeed to any such office
     of Parent, and each of them individually, such Stockholder's proxy and
     attorney-in-fact (with full power of substitution), for and in the name,
     place and stead of such Stockholder, to vote all of such Stockholder's
     Subject Shares, or grant a consent or approval in respect of such Subject
     Shares, (i) in favor of adoption of the Merger Agreement and the approval
     of the terms thereof and of the Merger and each of the other

     transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, (ii) against any
     Takeover Proposal or other Frustrating Transaction and (iii) otherwise in
     accordance with Section 3 of this Agreement. Such Stockholder understands
     and acknowledges that Parent is entering into the Merger Agreement in
     reliance upon the Stockholder's execution and delivery of this Agreement.

               (b)  Each Stockholder represents that any proxies heretofore
     given in respect of such Stockholder's Subject Shares are not irrevocable,
     and that all such proxies are hereby revoked.

               (c)  Each Stockholder hereby affirms that the irrevocable proxy
     set forth in this Section 4 is given in connection with the execution of
     the Merger Agreement, and that such irrevocable proxy is given to secure
     the performance of the duties of such Stockholder under this Agreement.
     Each Stockholder hereby further affirms that the irrevocable proxy is
     coupled with an interest and may under no circumstances be revoked.  Each
     Stockholder hereby ratifies and confirms all that such irrevocable proxy
     may lawfully do or cause to be done by virtue hereof.  Each such
     irrevocable proxy is executed and intended to be irrevocable in accordance
     with the provisions of Section 212(e) of the DGCL.

               SECTION 5.  Further Assurances.  Such Stockholder shall use its
                           -------------------
     reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and to
     do, or cause to be done, and to assist and cooperate with the other parties
     in doing, all things necessary, proper or advisable to consummate and make
     effective the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the Merger
     Agreement.  No Stockholder shall commit or agree to take any action that
     would in any way limit the ability of such Stockholder to perform its
     obligations under this Agreement.  Without limiting the generality of the
     foregoing, each Stockholder shall, from time to time, exe cute and deliver,
     or cause to be executed and delivered, such additional or further consents,
     documents and other instruments as Parent may request for the purpose of
     effectuating the matters covered by this Agreement, including with respect
     to any purchase of Subject Shares by Parent pursuant in Section 3(d) and
     the grant of the proxies set forth in Section 4.

               SECTION 6.  Certain Events.  Each Stockholder agrees that this
                           ---------------
     Agreement and the obligations hereunder shall attach to such Stockholder's
     Subject Shares and shall be binding upon any person or entity to which
     legal or beneficial ownership of such Subject Shares shall pass, whether by
     operation of law or otherwise, including such Stockholder's heirs,
     guardians, administrators or successors.  In the event of any stock split,
     stock

     dividend, reclassification, merger, reorganization, recapitalization
     or other change in the capital structure of the Company affecting the
     capital stock of the Company, the number of Original Shares and the number
     of Subject Shares listed on Schedule A hereto opposite the name of each
     Stockholder and the Parent Option Price shall be adjusted appropriately.
     In addition, in the event that any Stockholder acquires any additional
     shares of capital stock of the Company or other voting securities of the
     Company (including through the exercise of any warrants, stock options or
     similar instruments), the number of Subject Shares listed on Schedule A
     hereto opposite the name of such Stockholder shall be adjusted
     appropriately.  This Agreement and the representations, warranties,
     covenants, agreements and obligations hereunder shall attach to any
     additional shares of capital stock of the Company or other voting
     securities of the Company issued to or acquired by any Stockholder
     (including through the exercise of any warrants, stock options or similar
     instruments).

               SECTION 7.  Assignment.  Neither this Agreement nor any of the
                           -----------
     rights, interests or obligations under this Agreement shall be assigned, in
     whole or in part, by operation of law or otherwise, by any of the parties
     hereto without the prior written consent of the other parties hereto,
     except that (x) Parent may, in its sole discretion, assign any of or all
     its rights, interests and obligations under this Agreement to any direct or
     indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Parent and (y) if Parent reasonably
     believes that it is impracticable or financially disadvantageous as a
     result of circumstances arising after the date of this Agreement for Parent
     to exercise the option to purchase Subject Shares granted in Section 3(d)
     (including as a result of any stockholders' rights plan or similar
     arrangement), Parent may assign any of or all its rights, interests and
     obligations under Section 3(d) to the extent necessary to eliminate such
     impracticability or financial disadvantage, but no such assignment shall
     relieve Parent of any of its obligations under this Agreement.  Any
     purported assignment in violation of this Section 7 shall be void.  Subject
     to the preceding sentences of this Section 7, this Agreement shall be
     binding upon, inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by, the parties
     hereto and their respective successors and assigns.

               SECTION 8.  Termination.  This Agreement shall terminate upon (x)
                           ------------
     the Effective Time, (y) the termination of the Merger Agreement (if
     terminated by Parent) or (z) 45 days after the termination of the Merger
     Agreement if the Merger Agreement is otherwise terminated (other than with
     respect to Sections 3(a), (b), (e), (f), (g) and 4, which will terminate if
     the Merger Agreement terminates).  No termination of this Agreement shall
     relieve any party hereto

     from any liability for any breach of any provision of this Agreement prior
     to termination.

               SECTION 9.  General Provisions.  (a)  Amendments.  This Agreement
                           -------------------       -----------
     may not be amended except by an instrument in writing signed by all of the
     parties hereto.

               (b)  Notices.  All notices, requests, clauses, demands and other
                    --------
     communications under this Agreement shall be in writing and shall be deemed
     given if delivered personally, telecopied (with confirmation) or sent by
     overnight or same-day courier (providing proof of delivery) to Parent in
     accordance with Section 8.02 of the Merger Agreement and to the
     Stockholders (including the Representative) at their respective addresses
     set forth on Schedule A hereto (or at such other address for a party as
     shall be specified by like notice).

               (c)  Interpretation.  When a reference is made in this Agreement
                    ---------------
     to a Section or a Schedule, such reference shall be to a Section of, or a
     Schedule to, this Agreement unless otherwise indicated.  The headings
     contained in this Agreement are for reference purposes only and shall not
     affect in any way the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement.
     Whenever the words "include", "includes" or "including" are used in this
     Agreement, they shall be deemed to be followed by the words "without
     limitation".  The words "hereof", "herein" and "hereunder" and words of
     similar import when used in this Agreement shall refer to this Agreement as
     a whole and not to any particular provision of this Agreement.  The term
     "or" is not exclusive.  The definitions contained in this Agreement are
     applicable to the singular as well as the plural forms of such terms.  Any
     agreement or instrument defined or referred to herein or in any agreement
     or instrument that is referred to herein means such agreement or instrument
     as from time to time amended, modified or supplemented.  References to a
     person are also to its permitted successors and assigns.

               (d)  Counterparts; Effectiveness.  This Agreement may be executed
                    ----------------------------
     in one or more counterparts, all of which shall be considered one and the
     same agreement and shall become effective when one or more counterparts
     have been signed by each of the parties hereto and delivered to the other
     party.  The effectiveness of this Agreement shall be conditioned upon the
     execution and delivery of the Merger Agreement by each of the parties
     thereto.

               (e)  Entire Agreement; No Third-Party Beneficiaries.  This
                    -----------------------------------------------
     Agreement (including the documents and instruments referred to herein) (i)
     constitutes the entire agreement and supersedes all prior agreements and
     understandings, both written and oral, among the parties hereto with
     respect to the subject matter of this Agreement

     and (ii) is not intended to confer upon any person other than the parties
     hereto (and the persons specified as proxies in Section 4) any rights or
     remedies.

               (f)  Governing Law.  THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE GOVERNED BY AND
                    --------------
     CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF DELAWARE, WITHOUT
     REGARD TO ANY PRINCIPLES OF CONFLICTS OF LAWS OF SUCH STATE.

               (g)  Severability.  If any term or other provision of this
                    -------------
     Agreement is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any rule of
     law or public policy, all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement
     shall nevertheless remain in full force and effect.  Upon such
     determination that any term or other provision is invalid, illegal or
     incapable of being enforced, the parties hereto shall negotiate in good
     faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the
     parties as closely as possible to the fullest extent permitted by
     applicable law in an acceptable manner and to the end that the transactions
     contemplated hereby are fulfilled to the extent possible.

               SECTION 10.  Enforcement.  The parties agree that irreparable
                            ------------
     damage would occur in the event that any of the provisions of this
     Agreement were not performed in accordance with their specific terms or
     were otherwise breached.  It is accordingly agreed that the parties shall
     be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this
     Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this
     Agreement in any court of the United States located in the State of
     Delaware or in any Delaware state court, this being in addition to any
     other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity.  In addition,
     each of the parties hereto (a) consents to submit itself to the personal
     jurisdiction of any court of the United States located in the State of
     Delaware or of any Delaware state court in the event any dispute arises out
     of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (b)
     agrees that it will not attempt to deny or defeat such personal
     jurisdiction by motion or other request for leave from any such court and
     (c) agrees that it will not bring any action relating to this Agreement or
     the transactions contemplated by this Agreement in any court other than a
     court of the United States located in the State of Delaware or a Delaware
     state court.

               SECTION 11.  Stockholder Capacity.  No person executing this
                            ---------------------
     Agreement who is or becomes during the term hereof a director or officer of
     the Company makes any agreement or understanding herein in his or her
     capacity as such director or officer.  Each Stockholder signs solely in his
     or her capacity as the record holder and beneficial owner of, or the
     trustee of a trust whose beneficiaries are the beneficial owners of, such
     Stockholder's Subject Shares

     and nothing herein shall limit or affect any actions taken by a Stockholder
     in his or her capacity as an officer or director of the Company in
     exercising his or her rights under the Merger Agreement.

          IN WITNESS WHEREOF, Parent has caused this Agreement to be signed by
     its officer thereunto duly authorized and each Stockholder has signed this
     Agreement, all as of the date first written above.

                                                  April 18, 2001

Board of Directors
Mainspring, Inc.
One Main Street

Cambridge, MA 02142

Gentlemen:

We understand that Mainspring, Inc. ("Mainspring" or the "Company"),
International Business Machines Corporation ("IBM") and Waterfall Acquisition
Corp., a wholly owned subsidiary of IBM ("Sub") propose to enter into an
Agreement and Plan of Merger, substantially in the form of the draft dated April
13, 2001 (the "Merger Agreement"), which provides, among other things, for the
merger (the "Merger") of Sub with and into Mainspring. Pursuant to the Merger,
Mainspring will become a wholly owned subsidiary of IBM and each outstanding
share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share (the "Company Common Stock") of
Mainspring, other than shares held in treasury or held by IBM or any affiliate
of IBM or as to which dissenters' rights have been perfected, will be converted
into the right to receive $4.00 per share in cash. The terms and conditions of
the Merger are more fully set forth in the Merger Agreement and certain related
documents.

You have asked for our opinion as to whether the consideration to be received by
the holders of shares of Company Common Stock pursuant to the Merger Agreement
is fair from a financial point of view to such holders (other than IBM and its
affiliates).

For purposes of the opinion set forth herein, we have:

     (i)     reviewed certain publicly available financial statements and other
             business and financial information of Mainspring;

     (ii)    reviewed certain internal financial statements and other financial
             and operating data concerning Mainspring prepared by the management
             of Mainspring;

     (iii)   reviewed certain financial forecasts prepared by the management of
             Mainspring;

     (iv)    discussed the past and current operations and financial condition
             and the prospects of Mainspring with senior executives of
             Mainspring;

     (v)     reviewed the reported prices and trading activity for the Company
             Common Stock;

     (vi)    compared the financial performance of Mainspring and the prices and
             trading activity of the Company Common Stock with that of certain
             other comparable publicly-traded companies and their securities;

     (vii)   reviewed the financial terms, to the extent publicly available, of
             certain comparable acquisition transactions;

     (viii)  had limited participation in discussions and negotiations among
             representatives of Mainspring and IBM and their legal advisors;

     (ix)    reviewed the draft Merger Agreement and certain related documents;
             and

     (x)     performed such other analyses and considered such other factors as
             we have deemed appropriate.

We have assumed and relied upon without independent verification the accuracy
and completeness of the information supplied or otherwise made available to us
by the Company for the purposes of this opinion. With respect to the financial
forecasts, we have assumed that they have been reasonably prepared on bases
reflecting the best currently available estimates and judgments of the future
financial performance of the Company. We have assumed that the Merger will be
consummated in accordance with the terms set forth in the Merger Agreement. We
have not made any independent valuation or appraisal of the assets or
liabilities of the Company, nor have we been furnished with any such appraisals.
Our opinion is necessarily based on financial, economic, market and other
conditions as in effect on, and the information made available to us as of, the
date hereof.

We have acted as financial advisor to the Board of Directors of Mainspring in
connection with this transaction and will receive a fee for our services. In the
past, Morgan Stanley & Co. Incorporated and its affiliates have provided
financial advisory and financing services for Mainspring and IBM and have
received fees for the rendering of these services.

It is understood that this letter is for the information of the Board of
Directors of Mainspring only and may not be used for any other purpose without
our prior written consent, except that this opinion may be included in its
entirety in any filing made by Mainspring in respect of the transaction with the
Securities and Exchange Commission.  In addition, Morgan Stanley expresses no
opinion or recommendation as to how the shareholders of Mainspring should vote
at the shareholders' meeting held in connection with the Merger.

Based upon and subject to the foregoing, we are of the opinion on the date
hereof that the consideration to be received by the holders of shares of the
Company Common Stock pursuant to the Merger Agreement is fair from a financial
point of view to such holders (other than IBM and its affiliates).

                              Very truly yours,

                              MORGAN STANLEY & CO. INCORPORATED

                                    Lance L. Hirt
                                    Principal

                                                                         ANNEX 4

                       DELAWARE GENERAL CORPORATION LAW

SEC. 262 APPRAISAL RIGHTS.

     (a) Any stockholder of a corporation of this State who holds shares of
stock on the date of the making of a demand pursuant to subsection (d) of this
section with respect to such shares, who continuously holds such shares through
the effective date of the merger or consolidation, who has otherwise complied
with subsection (d) of this section and who has neither voted in favor of the
merger or consolidation nor consented thereto in writing pursuant to Section 228
of this title shall be entitled to an appraisal by the Court of Chancery of the
fair value of the stockholder's shares of stock under the circumstances
described in subsections (b) and (c) of this section. As used in this section,
the work "stockholder" means a holder of record of stock in a stock corporation
and also a member of record of a nonstock corporation; the words "stock" and
"share" mean and include what is ordinarily meant by those words and also
membership or membership interest of a member of a nonstock corporation; and the
words "depository receipt" mean a receipt or other instrument issued by a
depository representing an interest in one or more shares, or fractions thereof,
solely of stock of a corporation, which stock is deposited with the depository.

     (b) Appraisal rights shall be available for the shares of any class or
series of stock of a constituent corporation in a merger or consolidation to be
effected pursuant to Section 251 (other than a merger effected pursuant to
Section 251(g) of this title), Section 252, Section 254, Section 257, Section
258, Section 263 or Section 264 of this title:

         (1) Provided, however, that no appraisal rights under this section
     shall be available for the shares of any class or series of stock, which
     stock, or depository receipts in respect thereof, at the record date fixed
     to determine the stockholders entitled to receive notice of and to vote at
     the meeting of stockholders to act upon the agreement of merger or
     consolidation, were either (i) listed on a national securities exchange or
     designated as a national market system security on an interdealer quotation
     system by the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. or (ii) held
     of record by more than 2,000 holders; and further provided that no
     appraisal rights shall be available for any shares of stock of the
     constituent corporation surviving a merger if the merger did not require
     for its approval the vote of the stockholders of the surviving corporation
     as provided in subsection (f) of Section 251 of this title.

         (2) Notwithstanding paragraph (1) of this subsection, appraisal rights
     under this section shall be available for the shares of any class or series
     of stock of a constituent corporation if the holders thereof are required
     by the terms of an agreement of merger or consolidation pursuant to
     Sections 251, 252, 254, 257, 258, 263 and 264 of this title to accept for
     such stock anything except:

             a.  Shares of stock of the corporation surviving or resulting from
          such merger or consolidation, or depository receipts in respect
          thereof ;

             b.  Shares of stock of any other corporation, or depository
          receipts in respect thereof, which shares of stock (or depository
          receipts in respect thereof) or depository receipts at the effective
          date of the merger or consolidation will be either listed on a
          national securities exchange or designated as a national market system
          security on an interdealer quotation system by the National
          Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. or held of record by more than
          2,000 holders;

             c.  Cash in lieu of fractional shares or fractional depository
          receipts described in the foregoing subparagraphs a. and b. of this
          paragraph; or

             d.  Any combination of the shares of stock, depository receipts and
          cash in lieu of fractional shares or fractional depository receipts
          described in the foregoing subparagraphs a., b. and c. of this
          paragraph.

         (3) In the event all of the stock of a subsidiary Delaware corporation
     party to a merger effected under Section 253 of this title is not owned by
     the parent corporation immediately prior to the merger, appraisal rights
     shall be available for the shares of the subsidiary Delaware corporation.

     (c) Any corporation may provide in its certificate of incorporation that
appraisal rights under this section shall be available for the shares of any
class or series of its stock as a result of an amendment to its certificate of
incorporation, any merger or consolidation in which the corporation is a
constituent corporation or the sale of all or substantially all of the assets of
the corporation. If the certificate of incorporation contains such a provision,
the procedures of this section, including those set forth in subsections (d) and
(e) of this section, shall apply as nearly as is practicable.

     (d) Appraisal rights shall be perfected as follows:

         (1) If a proposed merger or consolidation for which appraisal rights
     are provided under this section is to be submitted for approval at a
     meeting of stockholders, the corporation, not less than 20 days prior to
     the meeting, shall notify each of its stockholders who was such on the
     record date for such meeting with respect to shares for which appraisal
     rights are available pursuant to subsection (b) or (c) hereof that
     appraisal rights are available for any or all of the shares of the
     constituent corporations, and shall include in such notice a copy of this
     section. Each stockholder electing to demand the appraisal of such
     stockholder's shares shall deliver to the corporation, before the taking of
     the vote on the merger or consolidation, a written demand for appraisal of
     such stockholder's shares. Such demand will be sufficient if it reasonably
     informs the corporation of the identity of the stockholder and that the
     stockholder intends thereby to demand the appraisal of such stockholder's
     shares. A proxy or vote against the merger or consolidation shall not
     constitute such a demand. A stockholder electing to take such action must
     do so by a separate written demand as herein provided. Within 10 days after
     the effective date of such merger or consolidation, the surviving or
     resulting corporation shall notify each stockholder of each constituent
     corporation who has complied with this subsection and has not voted in
     favor of or consented to the merger or consolidation of the date that the
     merger or consolidation has become effective; or

         (2) If the merger or consolidation was approved pursuant to Section
     228 or Section 253 of this title, each constituent corporation, either
     before the effective date of the merger or consolidation or within ten days
     thereafter, shall notify each of the holders of any class or series of
     stock of such constituent corporation who are entitled to appraisal rights
     of the approval of the merger or consolidation and that appraisal rights
     are available for any or all shares of such class or series of stock of
     such constituent corporation, and shall include in such notice a copy of
     this section; provided that, if the notice is given on or after the
     effective date of the merger or consolidation, such notice shall be given
     by the surviving or resulting corporation to all such holders of any class
     or series of stock of a constituent corporation that are entitled to
     appraisal rights. Such notice may, and, if given on or after the effective
     date of the merger or consolidation, shall, also notify such stockholders
     of the effective date of the merger or consolidation. Any stockholder
     entitled to appraisal rights may, within 20 days after the date of mailing
     of such notice, demand in writing from the surviving or resulting
     corporation the appraisal of such holder's shares. Such demand will be
     sufficient if it reasonably informs the corporation of the identity of the
     stockholder and that the stockholder intends thereby to demand the
     appraisal of such holder's shares. If such notice did not notify
     stockholders of the effective date of the merger or consolidation, either
     (i) each such constituent corporation shall send a second notice before the
     effective date of the merger or consolidation notifying each of the holders
     of any class or series of stock of such constituent corporation that are
     entitled to appraisal rights of the effective date of the merger or
     consolidation or (ii) the surviving or resulting corporation shall send
     such a second notice to all such holders on or within 10 days after such
     effective date; provided, however, that if such second notice is sent more
     than 20 days following the sending of the first notice, such second notice
     need only be sent to each stockholder who is entitled to appraisal rights
     and who has demanded appraisal of such holder's shares in accordance with
     this subsection. An affidavit of the secretary or assistant secretary or of
     the transfer agent of the corporation that is required to give either

     notice that such notice has been given shall, in the absence of fraud, be
     prima facie evidence of the facts stated therein. For purposes of
     determining the stockholders entitled to receive either notice, each
     constituent corporation may fix, in advance, a record date that shall be
     not more than 10 days prior to the date the notice is given, provided, that
     if the notice is given on or after the effective date of the merger or
     consolidation, the record date shall be such effective date. If no record
     date is fixed and the notice is given prior to the effective date, the
     record date shall be the close of business on the day next preceding the
     day on which the notice is given.

     (e) Within 120 days after the effective date of the merger or
consolidation, the surviving or resulting corporation or any stockholder who has
complied with subsections (a) and (d) hereof and who is otherwise entitled to
appraisal rights, may file a petition in the Court of Chancery demanding a
determination of the value of the stock of all such stockholders.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, at any time within 60 days after the effective
date of the merger or consolidation, any stockholder shall have the right to
withdraw such stockholder's demand for appraisal and to accept the terms offered
upon the merger or consolidation. Within 120 days after the effective date of
the merger or consolidation, any stockholder who has complied with the
requirements of subsections (a) and (d) hereof, upon written request, shall be
entitled to receive from the corporation surviving the merger or resulting from
the consolidation a statement setting forth the aggregate number of shares not
voted in favor of the merger or consolidation and with respect to which demands
for appraisal have been received and the aggregate number of holders of such
shares. Such written statement shall be mailed to the stockholder within 10 days
after such stockholder's written request for such a statement is received by the
surviving or resulting corporation or within 10 days after expiration of the
period for delivery of demands for appraisal under subsection (d) hereof,
whichever is later.

     (f) Upon the filing of any such petition by a stockholder, service of a
copy thereof shall be made upon the surviving or resulting corporation, which
shall within 20 days after such service file in the office of the Register in
Chancery in which the petition was filed a duly verified list containing the
names and addresses of all stockholders who have demanded payment for their
shares and with whom agreements as to the value of their shares have not been
reached by the surviving or resulting corporation. If the petition shall be
filed by the surviving or resulting corporation, the petition shall be
accompanied by such a duly verified list. The Register in Chancery, if so
ordered by the Court, shall give notice of the time and place fixed for the
hearing of such petition by registered or certified mail to the surviving or
resulting corporation and to the stockholders shown on the list at the addresses
therein stated. Such notice shall also be given by 1 or more publications at
least 1 week before the day of the hearing, in a newspaper of general
circulation published in the City of Wilmington, Delaware or such publication as
the Court deems advisable. The forms of the notices by mail and by publication
shall be approved by the Court, and the costs thereof shall be borne by the
surviving or resulting corporation.

     (g) At the hearing on such petition, the Court shall determine the
stockholders who have complied with this section and who have become entitled to
appraisal rights. The Court may require the stockholders who have demanded an
appraisal for their shares and who hold stock represented by certificates to
submit their certificates of stock to the Register in Chancery for notation
thereon of the pendency of the appraisal proceedings; and if any stockholder
fails to comply with such direction, the Court may dismiss the proceedings as to
such stockholder.

     (h) After determining the stockholders entitled to an appraisal, the Court
shall appraise the shares, determining their fair value exclusive of any element
of value arising from the accomplishment or expectation of the merger or
consolidation, together with a fair rate of interest, if any, to be paid upon
the amount determined to be the fair value. In determining such fair value, the
Court shall take into account all relevant factors. In determining the fair rate
of interest, the Court may consider all relevant factors, including the rate of
interest which the surviving or resulting corporation would have had to pay to
borrow money during the pendency of the proceeding. Upon application by the
surviving or resulting corporation or by any stockholder entitled to participate
in the appraisal proceeding, the Court may, in its discretion, permit discovery
or other pretrial proceedings and may proceed to trial upon the appraisal prior
to the final determination of the stockholder entitled to an appraisal. Any
stockholder whose name appears on the list filed by the surviving or resulting
corporation pursuant to subsection (f) of this section and who has submitted
such stockholder's certificates of stock to the Register in Chancery, if such is
required, may participate fully in all proceedings until it is finally
determined that such stockholder not entitled to appraisal rights under this
section.

     (i) The Court shall direct the payment of the fair value of the shares,
together with interest, if any, by the surviving or resulting corporation to the
stockholders entitled thereto. Interest may be simple or compound, as the Court
may direct. Payment shall be so made to each such stockholder, in the case of
holders of uncertificated stock forthwith, and the case of holders of shares
represented by certificates upon the surrender to the corporation of the
certificates representing such stock. The Court's decree may be enforced as
other decrees in the Court of Chancery may be enforced, whether such surviving
or resulting corporation be a corporation of this State or of any state.

     (j) The costs of the proceeding may be determined by the Court and taxed
upon the parties as the Court deems equitable in the circumstances. Upon
application of a stockholder, the Court may order all or a portion of the
expenses incurred by any stockholder in connection with the appraisal
proceeding, including, without limitation, reasonable attorney's fees and the
fees and expenses of experts, to be charged pro rata against the value of all
the shares entitled to an appraisal.

     (k) From and after the effective date of the merger or consolidation, no
stockholder who has demanded appraisal rights as provided in subsection (d) of
this section shall be entitled to vote such stock for any purpose or to receive
payment of dividends or other distributions on the stock (except dividends or
other distributions payable to stockholders of record at a date which is prior
to the effective date of the merger or consolidation); provided, however, that
if no petition for an appraisal shall be filed within the time provided in
subsection (e) of this section, or if such stockholder shall deliver to the
surviving or resulting corporation a written withdrawal of such stockholder's
demand for an appraisal and an acceptance of the merger or consolidation, either
within 60 days after the effective date of the merger or consolidation as
provided in subsection (e) of this section or thereafter with the written
approval of the corporation, then the right of such stockholder to an appraisal
shall cease. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no appraisal proceeding in the Court
of Chancery shall be dismissed as to any stockholder without the approval of the
Court, and such approval may be conditioned upon such terms as the Court deems
just.

     (l) The shares of the surviving or resulting corporation to which the
shares of such objecting stockholders would have been converted had they
assented to the merger or consolidation shall have the status of authorized and
unissued shares of the surviving or resulting corporation.
