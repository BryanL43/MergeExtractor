                                 July 23, 2001

Dear Remedy Corporation Stockholder:

    After careful consideration, the boards of directors of Peregrine
Systems, Inc. and Remedy Corporation have approved the merger of Remedy and
Peregrine. To effect the merger, Remedy will merge into a wholly-owned
subsidiary of Peregrine. Peregrine will issue its common stock and cash in
exchange for the outstanding shares of Remedy common stock, and the stockholders
of Remedy will become stockholders of Peregrine. The attached proxy
statement/prospectus provides detailed information concerning Peregrine, Remedy,
the merger agreement and the merger. Please review carefully all of the
information contained in the proxy statement/prospectus. IN PARTICULAR, YOU
SHOULD CAREFULLY CONSIDER THE DISCUSSION IN THE SECTION ENTITLED "RISK FACTORS"
BEGINNING ON PAGE 13 OF THIS PROXY STATEMENT/PROSPECTUS.

    If the merger is completed, each outstanding share of Remedy common stock
will be exchanged for $9.00 in cash and 0.9065 of a share of Peregrine common
stock. In addition, each option to purchase Remedy common stock will be assumed
by Peregrine and will, following the merger, become exercisable for an
equivalent amount of Peregrine common stock based on the value of stock and cash
each share of Remedy common stock receives in the merger. Peregrine expects to
issue approximately 28 million shares of its common stock in the merger, before
taking into account Peregrine common stock to be issued upon exercise of assumed
Remedy options. Peregrine's common stock is traded on the Nasdaq National Market
under the trading symbol "PRGN." On July 20, 2001, the closing price of
Peregrine's common stock was $22.66 per share. We encourage you to obtain more
recent quotations.

    You are cordially invited to attend a special meeting of Remedy's
stockholders to be held on August 27, 2001 at 9:00 a.m. (local time) at Remedy's
headquarters located at 1585 Charleston Road, Mountain View, California 94043.
Only stockholders who held shares of Remedy at the close of business on July 9,
2001 will be entitled to vote at this special meeting. At this meeting, you will
be asked to vote upon the merger agreement and the merger. The matters to be
submitted for consideration at the special meeting are described in more detail
in the attached notice of special meeting and in the proxy statement/prospectus.

    THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS OF REMEDY HAS UNANIMOUSLY DETERMINED THAT THE MERGER
AGREEMENT AND THE MERGER ARE FAIR TO, AND IN THE BEST INTERESTS OF, REMEDY AND
ITS STOCKHOLDERS AND THEREFORE UNANIMOUSLY RECOMMENDS THAT HOLDERS OF REMEDY'S
COMMON STOCK VOTE FOR APPROVAL AND ADOPTION OF THE MERGER AGREEMENT AND APPROVAL
OF THE MERGER.

    Please use this opportunity to take part in an important business decision
for Remedy by voting at Remedy's special meeting. Whether or not you plan to
attend the special meeting, please submit your proxy by following the
instructions on the enclosed proxy card. Submitting a proxy does NOT deprive you
of the right to attend the meeting and vote your shares in person. YOUR VOTE IS
VERY IMPORTANT. We appreciate your consideration of the merger.

                                                 Sincerely,

                                                 /s/ Lawrence L. Garlick

COMMISSION HAS APPROVED OR DISAPPROVED OF THE SHARES OF PEREGRINE COMMON STOCK
TO BE ISSUED IN CONNECTION WITH THE MERGER, NOR HAVE THEY PASSED UPON THE
ADEQUACY OR ACCURACY OF THIS PROXY STATEMENT/PROSPECTUS. ANY REPRESENTATION TO

                     QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS ABOUT THE MERGER

    THE FOLLOWING SECTION PROVIDES ANSWERS TO FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS ABOUT
THE SPECIAL MEETING, THE MERGER, AND THE EFFECT OF THE MERGER ON HOLDERS OF
REMEDY'S COMMON STOCK. THIS SECTION PROVIDES ONLY SUMMARY INFORMATION, HOWEVER.
FOR A MORE COMPLETE RESPONSE TO THESE QUESTIONS AND FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION,
PLEASE REFER TO THE CROSS-REFERENCED PAGES IN THIS PROXY STATEMENT/PROSPECTUS.

Q:  WHAT IS THE PROPOSED MERGER TRANSACTION?
    (SEE PAGE 46)

    A: The proposed merger transaction is to combine the businesses of Peregrine
        and Remedy. To combine the companies, Remedy will merge into a
        subsidiary of Peregrine. For a more complete description of the merger,
        see the section entitled "The Merger" on page 46.

Q:  WHY ARE PEREGRINE AND REMEDY PROPOSING THE MERGER? (SEE PAGES 48 AND 50)

    A: Peregrine and Remedy are proposing the merger because they believe the
        combined company will be well positioned to serve a broader range of
        customers with an expanded line of products and development
        environments. In particular, both companies believe that Peregrine's
        network management solutions for large enterprises complement Remedy's
        network management solutions, which have historically focused on smaller
        and medium-sized businesses and on departments or divisions of large
        organizations. A more complete discussion of the companies' respective
        reasons for proposing the merger is contained under the captions
        "Peregrine's reasons for the merger" on page 48 and "Remedy's reasons
        for the merger" on page 50.

Q:  WHAT PERCENTAGE OF PEREGRINE WILL THE FORMER REMEDY STOCKHOLDERS AND CURRENT
    PEREGRINE STOCKHOLDERS OWN IMMEDIATELY FOLLOWING THE MERGER?

    A: Based on the outstanding number of shares of Peregrine's common stock and
        Remedy's common stock as of July 9, 2001 and excluding options to
        purchase either company's common stock, the former stockholders of
        Remedy and the current stockholders of Peregrine will have approximately
        the following aggregate ownership interests in Peregrine common stock
        immediately following the merger:

                                    POST-MERGER AGGREGATE
                                    OWNERSHIP INTEREST IN
                                      PEREGRINE COMMON
                                          STOCK(%)
                                    ---------------------

     Former Remedy stockholders....         14.7
     Current Peregrine
       stockholders................         85.3

Q:  WHAT WILL A REMEDY STOCKHOLDER RECEIVE IN EXCHANGE FOR REMEDY COMMON STOCK
    IN THE MERGER? (SEE PAGE 68)

    A: If the merger is completed, Remedy stockholders will receive, in exchange
        for each outstanding share of Remedy common stock, $9.00 in cash and
        0.9065 of a share of Peregrine common stock.

        Peregrine will not issue fractional shares. Instead of issuing
        fractional shares, Peregrine will pay Remedy stockholders cash for any
        fractional shares of Peregrine common stock they would have otherwise
        received. The cash paid for fractional shares will be based on the
        closing price of Peregrine common stock on the day the merger becomes
        effective.

        The merger agreement, a contract among Peregrine, Remedy, and a
        subsidiary of Peregrine, is attached to this proxy statement/prospectus
        as Annex A. You should read the merger agreement carefully as it is the
        legal document that sets forth the parties' rights.

Q:  HOW WILL THE MERGER AFFECT OPTIONS TO ACQUIRE REMEDY COMMON STOCK? (SEE
    PAGE 70)

    A: Options to purchase shares of Remedy's common stock will be converted
        into options to purchase shares of

        Peregrine's common stock after completion of the merger. The number of
        shares covered by these options will be adjusted based on the value of
        Peregrine common stock and cash each share of Remedy common stock
        receives in the merger. The applicable exercise price will also be
        correspondingly adjusted.

Q:  WILL REMEDY STOCKHOLDERS BE ABLE TO TRADE THE PEREGRINE COMMON STOCK THAT
    THEY RECEIVE IN THE MERGER? (SEE PAGE 65)

    A: Yes. However, certain persons who are deemed affiliates of Remedy will be
        required to comply with Rule 145 under the Securities Act of 1933 before
        they sell the shares of Peregrine common stock they receive in the
        merger. Peregrine's common stock is listed on the Nasdaq National Market
        under the symbol "PRGN."

Q:  WHAT STOCKHOLDER APPROVALS ARE NEEDED TO COMPLETE THE MERGER? (SEE PAGE 43)

    A: A majority of the outstanding shares of Remedy's common stock as of the
        record date, voting in person or by proxy, must approve and adopt the
        merger agreement and approve the merger. In order to hold the special
        meeting, a majority of the outstanding shares of Remedy's common stock
        as of the record date must be present in person or represented by proxy
        at the special meeting.

Q:  DOES THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS OF REMEDY RECOMMEND VOTING IN FAVOR OF APPROVAL
    AND ADOPTION OF THE MERGER AGREEMENT AND APPROVAL OF THE MERGER? (SEE PAGE
    43)

    A: Yes. After careful consideration, Remedy's board of directors unanimously
        recommends that Remedy's stockholders vote in favor of the approval and
        adoption of the merger agreement and approval of the merger.

Q:  ARE THERE RISKS I SHOULD CONSIDER IN DECIDING WHETHER TO VOTE FOR THE
    MERGER? (SEE PAGE 13)

    A: Yes. In evaluating the merger, you should carefully consider the factors
        discussed in the section entitled "Risk Factors" beginning on page 13.

Q:  WHAT DO I NEED TO DO NOW? (SEE PAGE 43)

    A: After carefully reading and considering the information contained in and
        incorporated into this proxy statement/ prospectus, please submit your
        proxy according to the instructions on the enclosed proxy card as soon
        as possible. If you do not submit a proxy or attend the Remedy special
        meeting and vote in person, your shares will not be represented or voted
        at the meeting.

Q:  CAN I SUBMIT MY PROXY BY TELEPHONE OR OVER THE INTERNET? (SEE PAGE 44)

    A: If you hold your shares through a bank or brokerage firm, you may be able
        to submit your proxy by telephone or over the Internet. You should refer
        to the proxy card included with your materials for instructions about
        how to vote. If you vote by telephone or over the Internet, you do not
        need to complete and mail your proxy card.

        Stockholders of Remedy who are the registered holders of their shares
        will not be able to vote by telephone or over the Internet.

Q:  IF MY SHARES ARE HELD IN "STREET NAME" BY MY BANK OR BROKER, WILL MY BANK OR
    BROKER VOTE MY SHARES FOR ME? (SEE PAGE 44)

    A: Your bank or broker will vote your shares only if you provide
        instructions on how to vote by following the information provided to
        you.

        If you do not instruct your bank or broker how to vote your shares, it
        will not have discretionary authority to vote your shares on the matters
        currently proposed to be presented at the special meeting. As a result,
        your bank or broker may deliver a proxy card

        expressly indicating that it is NOT voting your shares. This indication
        that a broker is not voting your shares is referred to as a "broker
        non-vote." Broker non-votes will be counted for the purpose of
        determining the presence or absence of a quorum at the special meeting.
        However, a broker non-vote will be equivalent to a vote against adoption
        and approval of the merger agreement and against approval of the merger.

Q:  WHAT DO I DO IF I WANT TO CHANGE MY VOTE AFTER I HAVE SUBMITTED MY PROXY?
    (SEE PAGE 45)

    A: You may change your vote at any time before your proxy is voted at your
        special meeting. There are three ways for you to do this:

        - send notice to the secretary of Remedy that you wish to revoke your
          proxy;

        - send notice to the secretary of Remedy that you wish to change your
          proxy; or

        - attend the special meeting and vote in person.

        If your shares are held in "street name" by a bank or broker and you
        have instructed your bank or broker to vote your shares, you must follow
        your bank's or broker's instructions to change your vote.

Q:  WHAT HAPPENS IF A REMEDY STOCKHOLDER DOESN'T VOTE, SUBMITS AN INCOMPLETE
    PROXY, OR ABSTAINS FROM VOTING? (SEE PAGE 44)

    A: If you do not submit a proxy or attend the special meeting and vote in
        person, it will have the same effect as a vote against adoption and
        approval of the merger agreement and against approval of the merger.

        If you submit a proxy and do not indicate how you want to vote, your
        proxy will be counted as a vote to adopt and approve the merger
        agreement and to approve the merger.

        If you submit a proxy and affirmatively elect to abstain from voting,
        your proxy will have the same effect as a vote against adoption and
        approval of the merger agreement and against approval of the merger.

Q:  WHEN AND WHERE IS THE REMEDY SPECIAL MEETING?

    A: The Remedy special meeting will take place at Remedy's headquarters
        located at 1585 Charleston Road, Mountain View, California 94043 on
        August 27, 2001 at 9:00 a.m., local time.

Q:  WHEN DO YOU EXPECT THE MERGER TO BE COMPLETED? (SEE PAGE 68)

    A: Peregrine and Remedy are working to complete the merger as quickly as
        possible. In addition to receiving the required approvals from holders
        of Remedy's common stock, Peregrine and Remedy must also receive
        clearance for the merger under applicable foreign antitrust laws.
        Peregrine and Remedy hope to complete the merger before August 31, 2001.

Q:  SHOULD REMEDY STOCKHOLDERS SEND IN THEIR STOCK CERTIFICATES NOW? (SEE
    PAGE 69)

    A: No. After the merger is completed, Peregrine will send you written
        instructions for exchanging your Remedy stock certificates for Peregrine
        stock certificates.

Q:  WHAT ARE THE TAX CONSEQUENCES OF THE MERGER TO ME? (SEE PAGE 60)

    A: Peregrine and Remedy each expect the merger to qualify as a
        reorganization for U.S. federal income tax purposes. If the merger
        qualifies as a reorganization, Remedy stockholders will only recognize
        gain, if any, for federal income tax purposes, with respect to the cash
        they receive in the merger. In addition, Remedy's stockholders will
        recognize gain or loss on any fractional shares of Peregrine common
        stock for which cash is received in lieu of a fractional share.

        Please carefully review the information under "Material United States
        federal income tax consequences of the merger" for a description of the
        material U.S. federal income tax consequences of the merger. The tax
        consequences to you will depend on the facts of your own situation.
        Please consult your tax advisors for a full understanding of the tax
        consequences of the merger to you.

Q:  AM I ENTITLED TO APPRAISAL RIGHTS? (SEE PAGES 64 AND 105)

    A: Yes. Under Delaware law, because a portion of the merger consideration is
        being paid in cash, holders of Remedy common stock may exercise
        appraisal rights in connection with the merger.

Q:  WILL THE RIGHTS OF A REMEDY STOCKHOLDER CHANGE AS A RESULT OF THE MERGER?
    (SEE PAGE 100)

    A: Yes. Remedy stockholder rights are currently governed by Remedy's
        certificate of incorporation, rights agreement and bylaws, while
        Peregrine stockholder rights are governed by Peregrine's certificate of
        incorporation and bylaws. Remedy stockholders will become Peregrine
        stockholders as a result of the merger.

Q:  WHOM SHOULD I CALL WITH QUESTIONS? (SEE PAGE 110)

    A: If you have any questions about the merger or any related transaction,
        please call the investor relations department at Remedy at
        (650) 903-5200 or at Peregrine at (858) 481-5000. You may also obtain
        additional information about Peregrine or Remedy from documents filed
        with the Securities and Exchange Commission by following the
        instructions in the section entitled "Where You Can Find More
        Information" on page 109.

                                 THE COMPANIES

PEREGRINE SYSTEMS, INC.

    Peregrine is a leading global provider of software and services that are
designed to reduce the frictional cost of doing business for its clients'
organizations. Peregrine offers products and services to address three principal
domains: infrastructure resource management; employee relationship management
(or self-service); and e-commerce technologies and services.

    Peregrine offers software products, services, and enabling technologies that
permit businesses to eliminate points of friction in their business processes
and to improve their returns on capital and investment in their infrastructure
assets and electronic business investments. Peregrine's solutions are intended
to make its customers more competitive in their markets by removing the friction
points associated with three primary business processes:

    - life cycle management of infrastructure assets, from the point of
      procurement through deployment, use, maintenance, change, and ultimately
      disposition;

    - employee procurement of the infrastructure required to do their jobs,
      including e-procurement, employee self-service, knowledge access, and
      reservation of shared assets, such as conference rooms and office space in
      remote locations; and

    - e-transaction management, which eliminates friction points among buyers,
      suppliers, and market places as Peregrine's customers attempt to transact
      business through a global web of connected trading partners.

    Peregrine is organized to provide its solutions to customers through three
groups: the infrastructure management group, which consists of software,
technologies, and services representing its traditional infrastructure
management business and employee relationship management (or self-service)
products; the e-markets group, which provides a suite of business-to-business
software products and services to facilitate the processes of selling and
purchasing direct goods among trading partners; and the integrated solutions
group, which focuses on leveraging the synergies between Peregrine's
infrastructure management and e-markets groups by working with Peregrine's large
alliance partners, including some of the world's largest consulting firms,
managed service providers, and system integrators.

    Rose Acquisition Corporation is a wholly owned subsidiary of Peregrine that
was recently formed solely for the purpose of the merger. It does not conduct
any business and has no material assets.

    Peregrine was incorporated in California in 1981 and reincorporated in
Delaware in 1994. Peregrine's principal executive offices are located at 3611
Valley Centre Drive, San Diego, California 92130, and its telephone number is
(858) 481-5000. Rose Acquisition Corporation has the same address and telephone
number as Peregrine.

REMEDY CORPORATION

    Remedy develops, markets and supports highly adaptable software solutions.
Its solutions are focused on automating frequently changing, employee-intensive,
everyday business processes. Remedy has two families of solutions: information
technology service management solutions and customer relationship management
solutions. Information technology service management solutions such as REMEDY
HELP DESK, REMEDY SERVICE LEVEL AGREEMENTS, REMEDY ASSET MANAGEMENT and REMEDY
CHANGE MANAGEMENT manage and streamline the business processes for serving and
supporting corporations' internal customers and for managing the full life-cycle
of assets. Customer relationship management solutions such as REMEDY CUSTOMER
SUPPORT, REMEDY QUALITY MANAGEMENT, REMEDY LEADS MANAGEMENT and REMEDY SALES
CONTINUUM manage external customer relationships including the management of
customer support. Important product attributes of each family of solutions
include flexible integration capabilities in a packaged solution, speed of
implementation, ease of use, rapid return on investment, and on-going
adaptability.

    Remedy's software is designed to integrate, generally without programming,
with a wide variety of computer and telecommunication technologies and products,
including desktop applications, enterprise resource planning applications,
telephony devices, hand-held devices, network management systems and legacy
systems. Remedy provides a highly scalable, ready-to-deploy foundation and
solutions that are easy to change. The majority of customer installations take
place in less than 90 days. Customers use the solutions as is, out-of-the-box,
or point-and-click to easily tailor them to specific company requirements. The
concept is similar to spreadsheet software, which can be used as a simple
tabular calculating platform or can be modified to include sophisticated
formulas and style changes to create unique solutions. More importantly,
Remedy's solutions are adaptable to meet most future requirements and growth
without costly programming.

    Remedy was incorporated in Delaware in 1990. Remedy's principal executive
officers are located at 1585 Charleston Road, Mountain View, California 94043,
and its telephone number is (650) 903-5200.

                                   THE MERGER

REASONS FOR THE MERGER (SEE PAGE 48 AND 50)

    Peregrine's and Remedy's boards of directors believe that the merger and the
merger agreement will be beneficial to each company. Peregrine and Remedy have
each identified several reasons for this belief. These reasons are discussed in
greater detail under the caption "Remedy's reasons for the merger" beginning on
page 50 and "Peregrine's reasons for the merger" beginning on page 48.

RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH PEREGRINE, REMEDY AND THE MERGER (SEE PAGE 13)

    The merger poses risks to each company and its respective stockholders. In
addition, both Peregrine and Remedy are subject to various risks associated with
their businesses and their industry. These risks are discussed in greater detail
under the caption "Risk Factors" beginning on page 13. Peregrine and Remedy both
encourage you to read and consider all of these risks carefully.

THE REMEDY SPECIAL MEETING (SEE PAGE 43)

    Remedy will hold a special meeting of its stockholders to obtain stockholder
approval and adoption of the merger agreement with Peregrine and stockholder
approval of the merger.

    Remedy's special meeting will be held on August 27, 2001 at 9:00 a.m. (local
time) at Remedy's headquarters located at 1585 Charleston Road, Mountain View,
California 94043.

RECOMMENDATION OF REMEDY'S BOARD OF DIRECTORS (SEE PAGE 52)

    The board of directors of Remedy has unanimously determined that the merger
agreement and the merger are fair to, and in the best interests of, Remedy and
its stockholders. The board of directors of Remedy unanimously recommends that
Remedy's stockholders vote in favor of approval and adoption of the merger
agreement and in favor of approval of the merger.

RECORD DATE (SEE PAGE 43)

    The close of business on July 9, 2001 has been fixed as the record date for
determining the holders of Remedy common stock entitled to notice of and to vote
at Remedy's special meeting.

VOTING POWER (SEE PAGE 43)

    On the record date, 30,909,043 shares of Remedy's common stock were
outstanding. Each record holder of shares of Remedy's common stock will be
entitled at the special meeting to one vote for each Remedy share of common
stock held on the record date.

VOTE REQUIRED FOR APPROVAL (SEE PAGE 43)

    In order for the merger to become effective, holders of at least a majority
of Remedy's outstanding common stock at the record date must approve and adopt
the merger agreement and approve the merger.

VOTING AGREEMENTS OF OFFICERS AND DIRECTORS (SEE PAGE 84)

    Of Remedy's outstanding shares, 3,206,990 shares were held by officers and
directors of Remedy as of the record date. These shares represented
approximately 10.4% of Remedy's total outstanding shares on the record date.
Each of these officers and directors has agreed to vote his or her shares at
Remedy's special meeting in favor of the merger and the merger agreement.

OPINION OF REMEDY'S FINANCIAL ADVISOR (SEE PAGE 52)

    In deciding to approve the merger, the Remedy board of directors considered
the opinion of its financial advisor, Morgan Stanley & Co. Incorporated, that,
as of June 10, 2001, and subject to and based on the assumptions and
considerations referred to in the opinion, the consideration to be received by
the holders of common stock of Remedy pursuant to the merger agreement was fair
from a financial point of view to such holders. The full text of Morgan
Stanley's opinion is attached as Annex D to this proxy statement prospectus.
Remedy and Peregrine urge you to read the opinion of Morgan Stanley in its
entirety.

INTERESTS OF REMEDY'S DIRECTORS AND EXECUTIVE OFFICERS (SEE PAGE 65)

    Remedy stockholders should consider that some directors and executive
officers of Remedy have interests in the merger that are different from their
interests. These interests include:

    - All unvested shares of Remedy common stock and options to purchase Remedy
      common stock granted to non-employee directors of Remedy under its 1995
      Non-Employee Directors Stock Plan will become fully vested upon completion
      of the merger. The directors of Remedy that will receive this benefit are
      David A. Mahler, John F. Shoch, Harvey C. Jones, Sheri Anderson and John
      Olsen.

    - The options granted to employees of Remedy, including Remedy's officers,
      provide for accelerated vesting if the employees are involuntarily or
      constructively terminated within 18 months after completion of the merger.

    - Peregrine has agreed to appoint a designee of Remedy, who Remedy expects
      will be Lawrence L. Garlick, to Peregrine's board of directors after
      effectiveness of the merger.

    - Peregrine has agreed to continue to indemnify and provide directors' and
      officers' insurance coverage for the current officers and directors of
      Remedy for a period of six years following the merger.

STRUCTURE AND EFFECTS OF THE MERGER (SEE PAGE 68)

    Pursuant to the merger agreement, Remedy will be merged with and into Rose
Acquisition Corporation, and Rose Acquisition Corporation will continue as the
surviving corporation of the merger. Peregrine has the right to change the
structure of the merger such that at the completion of the merger either:

    - Rose Acquisition Corporation is merged with and into Remedy, and Remedy
      will continue as the surviving corporation of the merger; or

    - Remedy is merged with and into Peregrine and Peregrine will continue as
      the surviving corporation of the merger.

Peregrine may only restructure the merger if the restructured merger would
continue to qualify as a reorganization under the applicable provisions of the
Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended.

    As a result of the merger, each outstanding share of Remedy common stock
will be converted into the right to receive $9.00 in cash and 0.9065 of a share
of Peregrine common stock, subject to possible adjustment as described below.
The specific structure of the merger will not affect in any manner the
conversion of Remedy common stock in the merger or the consideration payable to
holders of Remedy common stock in connection with the merger. The cash portion
and the stock portion of the merger consideration were determined based upon
Remedy's capitalization representations and warranties in the merger agreement.
In the event that Remedy's capitalization representations and warranties are
determined to be inaccurate in any respect prior to the effective time of the
merger, the cash portion and the stock portion of the merger consideration will
be appropriately adjusted so that the aggregate amount of cash payable in the
merger will not exceed the aggregate amount of cash that otherwise would have
been payable in the merger had Remedy's capitalization representations and
warranties been accurate. In addition, the aggregate number of shares of
Peregrine common stock issuable in the merger will not exceed the aggregate
number of shares of Peregrine common stock that otherwise would have been
issuable in the merger had Remedy's capitalization representations and
warranties been accurate.

TREATMENT OF REMEDY STOCK OPTIONS AND PURCHASE RIGHTS UNDER THE REMEDY EMPLOYEE
  STOCK PURCHASE PLAN (SEE PAGE 70)

    At the completion of the merger, Peregrine will assume all of Remedy's
outstanding stock options, whether vested or unvested. As a result, all of
Remedy's outstanding stock options will be converted into options to purchase
Peregrine's common stock. All of the Remedy stock options that are assumed by
Peregrine at the completion of the merger will continue to be subject to the
same terms and conditions that were applicable to the stock options prior to the
merger, except that the aggregate number of shares issuable upon the exercise of
each stock option, and the exercise price of each stock option, will be adjusted
based upon an exchange ratio that is intended to be equivalent in value to the
per share cash and stock consideration payable to holders of Remedy common stock
in the merger.

    Remedy will terminate its employee stock purchase plan either on the day
immediately prior to the completion of the merger, or the last day of the last
full payroll period ending immediately prior to the completion of the merger.
Outstanding purchase rights under Remedy's employee stock purchase plan will be
exercised at the time of the termination of the plan, and each share of Remedy's
common stock

purchased upon that exercise will be converted into the right to receive the
cash and stock consideration payable for a share of Remedy common stock in
connection with the merger.

COMPLETION AND EFFECTIVENESS OF THE MERGER (SEE PAGE 68)

    Peregrine and Remedy expect to complete the merger when all of the
conditions to completion of the merger contained in the merger agreement have
been satisfied or waived. The merger will become effective upon the filing of a
certificate of merger with the Delaware Secretary of State under applicable
Delaware law. Peregrine and Remedy expect to file the certificate of merger
shortly following the special meeting of Remedy stockholders at which the merger
agreement and the merger will be presented and voted upon.

    Peregrine and Remedy are working toward satisfying the conditions to the
merger and completing the merger as soon as possible. Peregrine and Remedy hope
to complete the merger before August 31, 2001, assuming that the Remedy
stockholders adopt and approve the merger agreement and approve the merger at
the special meeting of Remedy's stockholders and that the other conditions to
the merger are satisfied promptly. However, because the merger is subject to
governmental and regulatory approvals and other conditions, some of which are
beyond Peregrine's and Remedy's control, Peregrine and Remedy cannot predict the
exact timing of the completion of the merger.

RESTRICTIONS ON SOLICITATION OF ALTERNATIVE TRANSACTIONS BY REMEDY (SEE PAGE 75)

    Under the terms of the merger agreement, Remedy may not solicit, initiate
or, subject to some exceptions, engage in discussions or negotiations with, or
provide material inside information to, any third party regarding some types of
acquisition transactions involving Remedy, including a merger, business
combination or sale of a material amount of Remedy's assets or capital stock.

CONDITIONS TO THE COMPLETION OF THE MERGER (SEE PAGE 78)

    Peregrine's and Remedy's obligations to complete the merger are subject to a
number of conditions, including:

    - the adoption and approval of the merger agreement and approval of the
      merger by the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of Remedy's
      common stock;

    - the absence of any law, injunction or other order prohibiting the merger;

    - the expiration or termination of applicable waiting periods under United
      States antitrust laws, and compliance with applicable foreign antitrust
      laws;

    - the absence of any regulatory action prohibiting the use of this document
      as a prospectus or a proxy statement in connection with the special
      meeting of Remedy stockholders;

    - the approval for quotation on the Nasdaq National Market of the shares of
      Peregrine's common stock to be issued in the merger;

    - receipt by each of Peregrine and Remedy of an opinion of counsel to the
      effect that the merger will be treated as a reorganization under the
      Internal Revenue Code;

    - the continuing accuracy of the representations and warranties of Peregrine
      and Remedy contained in the merger agreement, except to the extent that
      any inaccuracy would not have a material adverse effect on the subject
      company; and

    - the compliance by Peregrine and Remedy with the terms of the merger
      agreement in all material respects.

    Some of these conditions on Peregrine's and Remedy's obligations to complete
the merger may be waived by the company that is entitled to assert the
condition.

TERMINATION OF THE MERGER AGREEMENT AND PAYMENT OF THE TERMINATION FEE (SEE
  PAGES 79 AND 81)

    Peregrine and Remedy may terminate the merger agreement by mutual agreement.
In addition, either Peregrine or Remedy may terminate the merger agreement under
any of the following circumstances:

    - if Peregrine and Remedy do not complete the merger by October 31, 2001;
      but if Peregrine and Remedy do not complete the merger by October 31, 2001
      solely as a result of a failure to obtain all necessary regulatory
      approvals, Peregrine and Remedy may terminate the merger agreement only if
      they do not complete the merger by December 31, 2001;

    - if a court or other governmental authority issues a final, nonappealable
      order prohibiting the merger; or

    - if Remedy's stockholders fail to adopt and approve the merger agreement
      and fail to approve the merger at the special meeting of Remedy
      stockholders at which the merger agreement and the merger will be
      presented and voted upon.

    Remedy may also terminate the merger agreement under the following
additional circumstances:

    - if a condition to Remedy's obligations to complete the merger would not be
      satisfied because Peregrine breaches a covenant under the merger agreement
      in any material respect;

    - if a condition to Remedy's obligations to complete the merger would not be
      satisfied because any of the representations and warranties of Peregrine
      contained in the merger agreement become inaccurate and the inaccuracy
      would have a material adverse effect on Peregrine; or

    - if Remedy intends to enter into a definitive agreement with respect to an
      acquisition proposal from a third party that is superior to the terms of
      the merger agreement; provided that Peregrine has not matched the superior
      proposal and that Remedy has paid Peregrine a $40 million termination fee.

    Peregrine may also terminate the merger agreement under the following
additional circumstances:

    - if a condition to Peregrine's obligations to complete the merger would not
      be satisfied because Remedy breaches a covenant under the merger agreement
      in any material respect;

    - if the condition to Peregrine's obligations to complete the merger would
      not be satisfied because any of the representations and warranties of
      Remedy contained in the merger agreement become inaccurate and the
      inaccuracy would have a material adverse effect on Remedy;

    - if Remedy's board of directors withdraws or changes its recommendation
      that Remedy's stockholders adopt and approve the merger agreement and
      approve the merger;

    - if Remedy's board of directors approves or recommends that Remedy's
      stockholders approve an acquisition proposal from a third party;

    - if Remedy enters into a letter of intent or other agreement accepting an
      acquisition proposal from a third party; or

    - if Remedy's board of directors fails to reaffirm the merger following the
      commencement of a competing acquisition proposal from a third party in the
      form of a tender or exchange offer to acquire Remedy's outstanding capital
      stock.

    Peregrine and Remedy have agreed that if the merger agreement is terminated
under the circumstances described under "The Merger Agreement--Payment of
termination fee", Remedy will pay Peregrine a termination fee of $40 million.

MATERIAL UNITED STATES FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSEQUENCES OF THE MERGER (SEE PAGE
  60)

    Consummation of the merger is conditioned upon the receipt of opinions from
Peregrine's and Remedy's respective tax counsels that the merger will qualify as
a "reorganization" under section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as
amended. Assuming the merger qualifies, Remedy's stockholders will only
recognize gain, if any, for federal income tax purposes, to the extent they
receive cash in the merger. In addition, Remedy stockholders will recognize gain
or loss, as the case may be, to the extent they receive cash in lieu of the
receipt of a fractional share of Peregrine's common stock.

ACCOUNTING TREATMENT OF THE MERGER (SEE PAGE 60)

    Peregrine intends to account for the merger as a purchase for financial
accounting purposes. As a result of this accounting treatment, Peregrine will
record goodwill and other intangible assets on its balance sheet.

RESTRICTIONS ON RESALE OF PEREGRINE COMMON STOCK ISSUED IN THE MERGER (SEE PAGE
  65)

    The shares of Peregrine's common stock you receive in the merger will be
freely tradable after the merger unless you are considered an affiliate of
Remedy under applicable federal securities laws. Affiliates of Remedy may only
sell the shares of Peregrine common stock they receive in the merger in
compliance with Rule 145 under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. Each
person that Remedy believes to be an affiliate has signed an agreement
acknowledging his or her obligation to sell in compliance with Rule 145.

ANTITRUST APPROVALS (SEE PAGE 64)

    The merger is subject to waiting periods and other provisions of United
States and applicable foreign antitrust laws. Peregrine and Remedy have made
filings with, and have received early termination of the waiting period from,
the United States Department of Justice and the Federal Trade Commission. The
merger, however, may not be completed until filings have been made and waiting
periods have expired or been terminated under foreign antitrust laws. In
addition, the Department of Justice, the Federal Trade Commission, or a foreign
regulatory agency or other governmental or private person may challenge the
merger at any time, including after the expiration or termination of the
applicable waiting periods or after the merger is completed.

APPRAISAL RIGHTS (SEE PAGES 64 AND 105)

    Under Delaware law, Remedy stockholders are entitled to appraisal rights
with respect to the merger and, if the merger is completed, to receive payment
in cash for the fair value of their shares of Remedy common stock. In general,
to preserve their appraisal rights, Remedy stockholders who wish to exercise
these rights must:

    - deliver a written demand for appraisal to Remedy at or before the time the
      vote is taken at Remedy's special meeting;

    - not vote their shares for approval and adoption of the merger agreement
      and approval of the merger;

    - continuously hold their shares of Remedy common stock from the date they
      make the demand for appraisal through the closing of the merger; and

    - comply with the other procedures set forth in Section 262 of the Delaware
      General Corporation Law.

    The text of the Delaware statute governing appraisal rights is attached to
this prospectus/proxy statement as Annex E. Your failure to comply with the
procedures described in Annex E will result in the loss of your appraisal
rights. You are urged to read the text of the Delaware statute governing
appraisal rights carefully.

FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS IN THIS PROXY STATEMENT/PROSPECTUS

    This proxy statement/prospectus and the documents incorporated by reference
into this proxy statement/prospectus contain forward-looking statements within
the meaning of the "safe harbor" provisions of the Private Securities Litigation
Reform Act of 1995, including statements relating to the business, results of
operations, and financial condition of both Peregrine and Remedy, as well as
similar statements about the business, results of operations, and financial
condition of the combined company after the merger. Words such as will, would,
may, could, anticipates, expects, intends, plans, believes, seeks, estimates,
and similar expressions often identify forward-looking statements.

    These forward-looking statements are not guarantees of the future
performance of Peregrine, Remedy, or the combined company after the merger.
Forward looking statements are subject to many risks and uncertainties that
could cause actual results to differ materially from those contemplated by the
forward-looking statements. In evaluating the merger, you should carefully
consider the discussion of these and other factors in the section entitled "Risk
Factors" beginning on page 13.

                                  RISK FACTORS

    THE MERGER INVOLVES A HIGH DEGREE OF RISK. BY VOTING IN FAVOR OF THE MERGER,
STOCKHOLDERS OF REMEDY WILL BE CHOOSING TO INVEST IN PEREGRINE'S COMMON STOCK.
REMEDY STOCKHOLDERS WILL BE ASSUMING THE ADDITIONAL RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH THE
MERGER AND THE ON-GOING OPERATIONS OF THE COMBINED COMPANY. IN ADDITION TO THE
OTHER INFORMATION CONTAINED IN OR INCORPORATED BY REFERENCE INTO THIS PROXY
STATEMENT/PROSPECTUS, YOU SHOULD CAREFULLY CONSIDER THE FOLLOWING FACTORS IN
DETERMINING HOW TO VOTE.

RISKS RELATING TO THE MERGER

    THE SHARES OF PEREGRINE COMMON STOCK THAT REMEDY STOCKHOLDERS WILL RECEIVE
AS PART OF THE MERGER CONSIDERATION MAY NOT MAINTAIN THEIR VALUE.

    At the closing of the merger, each share of Remedy common stock will be
exchanged for $9.00 in cash and 0.9065 shares of Peregrine common stock. There
will be no adjustment in the number of shares of Peregrine common stock issued
to Remedy stockholders because of changes in the market price of either
Peregrine common stock or Remedy common stock. Accordingly, the specific dollar
value of Peregrine common stock that Remedy stockholders will receive upon the
merger's completion will depend entirely upon the market value of Peregrine
common stock at the time the merger is completed. This value may substantially
decrease from the date you submit your proxy. In addition, Remedy may not
terminate the merger agreement, "walk away" from the merger or re-solicit the
vote of its stockholders solely because of changes in the market price of
Peregrine common stock or Remedy common stock. The share prices of Peregrine
common stock and Remedy common stock are by nature subject to the general price
fluctuations in the market for publicly-traded equity securities, and the prices
of both companies' common stock have experienced significant volatility in the
past. We urge you to obtain recent market quotations for Peregrine common stock
and Remedy common stock. Neither Peregrine nor Remedy can predict or give any
assurances as to the respective market prices of its common stock at any time
before or after the completion of the merger.

    PEREGRINE MAY EXPERIENCE PROBLEMS INTEGRATING THE BUSINESSES OF PEREGRINE
AND REMEDY. ANY INTEGRATION PROBLEMS COULD CAUSE PEREGRINE TO INCUR SUBSTANTIAL
UNANTICIPATED COSTS AND EXPENSES, WHICH WOULD HARM PEREGRINE'S OPERATING
RESULTS.

    If Peregrine fails to successfully integrate Remedy's business into
Peregrine's business, Peregrine will incur substantial costs, which will
increase its expenses and increase its losses. Peregrine's and Remedy's target
markets have differed historically. Specifically, Peregrine's customer base has
been comprised principally of large, multinational enterprises, while Remedy's
sales have historically focused primarily on small to mid-size businesses and
organizations and on departments or divisions of large organizations. The
characteristics of these two market segments may be sufficiently distinct so
that Peregrine does not realize the anticipated synergies of the merger.
Peregrine has less experience selling to smaller organizations, and Peregrine's
sales practices and processes may not be well-suited to success in these
markets. In particular, Peregrine's sales efforts tend to focus on senior
executives, chief financial officers and chief information officers of large,
multinational corporations to whom Peregrine seeks to sell large,
enterprise-wide licenses of Peregrine's infrastructure management products. In
contrast, Remedy's transaction sizes tend to be substantially smaller, and its
sales efforts, when targeted at larger organizations, have historically focused
on managers of divisions or departments of the organization. In addition, Remedy
markets and sells other products, such as its customer relationship management
products, that Peregrine has no experience marketing or selling. If Peregrine is
unsuccessful in integrating the companies' respective businesses, the combined
revenues could fall or grow at a slower rate than anticipated, Peregrine could
incur substantial unexpected expenses, and Peregrine could fail to realize the
anticipated benefits of the merger.

    In addition, any integration problems Peregrine experiences could divert
Peregrine management's attention from other business opportunities, which could
result in slower revenue growth than

anticipated or in declines in revenue. Integrating Remedy's business into
Peregrine's business will be complex, time-consuming, and expensive. The merger
may disrupt both companies' businesses if not completed in a timely and
efficient manner. Peregrine and Remedy are both global companies with
substantial operations throughout the world, and integrating geographically
separate and dispersed organizations may be difficult. Specific integration
challenges faced by Peregrine and Remedy include the following:

    - retaining existing customers and strategic partners;

    - retaining and integrating management and other key employees of both
      companies;

    - combining product offerings and product lines effectively and quickly,
      including technical integration by Peregrine's and Remedy's respective
      engineering teams;

    - integrating sales efforts so that customers can easily do business with
      the combined company;

    - transitioning multiple locations around the world to common systems,
      including common information technology systems;

    - persuading employees that the business cultures of the two companies are
      compatible;

    - successfully developing and promoting a unified brand strategy and
      marketing it to existing and prospective customers; and

    - developing and maintaining uniform standards, controls, procedures, and
      policies.

    THE PUBLIC ANNOUNCEMENT OF THE MERGER COULD HAVE AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON ONE OR
BOTH COMPANIES' REVENUES IN NEAR-TERM QUARTERS IF CUSTOMERS DELAY, DEFER, OR
CANCEL PURCHASES PENDING RESOLUTION OF THE MERGER.

    The public announcement of the merger could have an adverse effect on the
near-term revenues and profitability of either or both of Peregrine and Remedy.
In particular, prospective customers could be reluctant to purchase either
company's products if they are uncertain about the direction of the combined
company's product offerings and its willingness to support and service existing
products. Since announcement of the merger, Peregrine and Remedy have
experienced questions from prospective customers about the status of the merger
and anticipated product integration plans, which have not yet been determined.
The merger was announced on June 11, 2001, in the last month of Peregrine's
first quarter of fiscal 2002 and the last month of Remedy's second quarter of
fiscal 2001. Both Peregrine and Remedy tend to realize a substantial portion of
their revenues during the last few weeks of a quarter. Accordingly, the
announcement of the merger could create uncertainty among businesses and
organizations contemplating software or service purchases and subscriptions. If
one large customer, or a significant group of small customers, were to delay
their purchase decisions pending resolution of the merger, the quarterly
revenues of either Peregrine or Remedy could be substantially below the
expectations of market analysts, which would have an adverse effect on their
results of operations and could cause a dramatic reduction in either company's
stock price. Peregrine and Remedy anticipate announcement of the merger could
have an adverse effect on their respective revenues in June 2001 and other near
term quarters pending completion of the merger and Peregrine's product
integration initiatives.

    THE MERGER COULD IMPAIR EXISTING RELATIONSHIPS OF PEREGRINE AND REMEDY WITH
SUPPLIERS, CUSTOMERS, STRATEGIC PARTNERS, AND EMPLOYEES, WHICH COULD HAVE AN
ADVERSE EFFECT ON PEREGRINE'S AND REMEDY'S INDIVIDUAL AND COMBINED BUSINESSES
AND FINANCIAL RESULTS.

    The public announcement of the merger could substantially impair important
business relationships of either Peregrine or Remedy. Impairment of these
business relationships could reduce revenues or

increase expenses, either of which would harm the financial results of the
affected company. Specific examples of situations in which Peregrine or Remedy
could experience problems include the following:

    - suppliers, distributors, or customers of either Peregrine or Remedy could
      decide to cancel or terminate existing arrangements, or fail to renew
      those arrangements, as a result of the merger;

    - customers of Remedy could terminate or delay orders with Remedy because
      they question Remedy's continued commitment to provide products and
      enhancements, or to support products;

    - key employees of Remedy may decide to terminate their employment; and

    - other current or prospective employees of Peregrine and Remedy may
      experience uncertainty about their future roles with the combined company,
      which could adversely affect Peregrine's and Remedy's ability to attract
      and retain key management, sales, marketing, and technical personnel.

    FAILURE TO COMPLETE THE MERGER COULD HAVE A NEGATIVE IMPACT ON PEREGRINE'S
AND REMEDY'S RESPECTIVE STOCK PRICES AS WELL AS A NEGATIVE IMPACT ON THEIR
RESPECTIVE BUSINESSES AND FINANCIAL RESULTS.

    If the merger is not completed for any reason, Peregrine and Remedy may be
subject to a number of material risks, including the following:

    - the respective prices of Peregrine and Remedy common stock may decline to
      the extent that the relevant current market price reflects a market
      assumption that the merger will be completed;

    - Peregrine's or Remedy's respective stock prices may decline because of
      uncertainty concerning Peregrine's or Remedy's stand-alone prospects;

    - some costs related to the merger, such as legal, accounting, financial
      advisory, and financial printing fees must be paid even if the merger is
      not completed;

    - Remedy could be required to pay Peregrine a termination fee in the amount
      of $40 million under certain circumstances;

    - the benefits that Peregrine and Remedy expect to realize from the merger,
      such as the potentially enhanced financial position of the combined
      company, would not be realized; and

    - the diversion of management attention from the day-to-day businesses of
      Peregrine and Remedy and the unavoidable disruption to their employees and
      their relationships with customers and suppliers during the period before
      consummation of the merger may make it difficult for Peregrine or Remedy
      to regain their respective financial market positions if the merger does
      not occur.

    If the merger is terminated and Remedy's board of directors seeks to enter
into another merger or business combination, there can be no assurance that
Remedy will be able to find another company willing to pay an equivalent or more
attractive price than the price to be paid in the merger with Peregrine. In
addition, while the merger agreement is in effect, Remedy is prohibited from
soliciting, initiating or taking any other action with respect to competing
transactions, such as a merger, sale of assets or other business combination
with any party other than Peregrine except as discussed on page 76 under
"Restrictions on solicitation of alternative acquisition proposals by Remedy."

RISKS RELATING TO PEREGRINE

    PEREGRINE HAS A HISTORY OF LOSSES, EXPECTS TO CONTINUE TO INCUR LOSSES FOR
THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE AND CANNOT ASSURE THAT IT WILL BE PROFITABLE IN THE
FUTURE ON AN OPERATING BASIS OR OTHERWISE.

    Peregrine has incurred substantial losses in recent years, and predicting
Peregrine's future operating results is difficult. If Peregrine continues to
incur losses, if Peregrine's revenues decline or

grow at a slower rate, or if Peregrine's expenses increase without commensurate
increases in revenues, Peregrine's operating results will suffer and the price
of Peregrine's common stock may fall. Through March 31, 2001, Peregrine had
recorded cumulative net losses of approximately $917.1 million, principally as a
result of acquisition costs related to the acquisitions Peregrine has completed
since late 1997. Peregrine has incurred, and expects to continue to incur,
substantial expenses associated with acquisition related costs, and amortization
of other intangible assets will result in Peregrine continuing to incur net
losses for the foreseeable future. In addition, Peregrine does not believe
recent revenue growth rates are sustainable in the future or indicative of
future growth rates. If Peregrine's revenue growth rates slow or its revenues
decline, Peregrine's operating results could be seriously impaired because many
of Peregrine's expenses are fixed and cannot be easily or quickly changed. A
reduction in Peregrine's revenue growth rate and/or an impairment of Peregrine's
financial results could lead to a dramatic decline in Peregrine's stock price.

    PEREGRINE'S REVENUES ARE NOT PREDICTABLE AND VARY SIGNIFICANTLY FROM
QUARTER-TO-QUARTER FOR NUMEROUS REASONS BEYOND PEREGRINE'S CONTROL.
QUARTER-TO-QUARTER VARIATIONS COULD RESULT IN A SUBSTANTIAL DECREASE IN
PEREGRINE'S STOCK PRICE IF PEREGRINE'S REVENUES OR OPERATING RESULTS ARE LESS
THAN MARKET ANALYSTS ANTICIPATE.

    Peregrine's revenues and operating results in a given quarter could be
substantially less than anticipated by market analysts, which could result in a
substantial decline in Peregrine's stock price. In addition, quarter-to-quarter
variations could create uncertainty about the direction or progress of
Peregrine's business, which could also result in a decline in the price of
Peregrine's common stock. Peregrine's revenues and operating results will vary
from quarter to quarter for many reasons beyond Peregrine's control, including
those described in this section. As a result, Peregrine's quarterly revenues and
operating results are not predictable with any significant degree of accuracy.

    PEREGRINE'S REVENUE GROWTH IS INCREASINGLY DEPENDENT ON A SMALL NUMBER OF
LARGE LICENSE TRANSACTIONS.

    Peregrine's revenues in a given quarter could be adversely affected if
Peregrine is unable to complete one or more large license agreements, if the
completion of a large license agreement is delayed, or if the contract terms
were to prevent Peregrine from recognizing revenue during that quarter.

    Peregrine's revenue growth in recent periods has been attributable in part
to an increase in the number of large license transactions sold to a limited
number of large, enterprise customers during a given period. For the year ended
March 31, 2001, sales to one of Peregrine's customers accounted for
approximately 10% of Peregrine's total revenues. Peregrine expects its reliance
on these large transactions with a limited number of customers to continue for
the foreseeable future. If Peregrine is unable to complete one or more large
license transactions by the end of a particular quarter, Peregrine's revenues
and operating results could be materially below the expectations of market
analysts, and Peregrine's stock price could fall. In particular, Peregrine's
dependence on a few relatively large license transactions could have an adverse
effect on Peregrine's quarterly revenues or revenue growth rates to the extent
Peregrine is unable to complete a large license transaction because a
prospective customer determines to reduce its capital investments in technology
in response to slowing economic growth.

    When negotiating large software licenses, many customers time their
negotiations near quarter-end in an effort to improve their ability to negotiate
more favorable pricing terms. As a result, Peregrine recognizes a substantial
portion of its revenues in the last month or weeks of a quarter, and license
revenues in a given quarter depend substantially on orders booked during the
last month or weeks of a quarter. If Peregrine is unable to complete a
sufficient number of license agreements during this short and intense sales
period, Peregrine's revenues could be substantially below the expectations of
market analysts, and Peregrine's stock price could decline.

    PEREGRINE'S QUARTERLY AND ANNUAL REVENUE AND REVENUE GROWTH RATES MAY BE
AFFECTED IF PEREGRINE'S DISTRIBUTION PARTNERS ARE UNSUCCESSFUL IN SELLING
PEREGRINE'S PRODUCTS OR IF PEREGRINE IS UNSUCCESSFUL IN ADDING NEW DISTRIBUTION
PARTNERS.

    Many of Peregrine's transactions are sourced, developed, and closed through
Peregrine's strategic and distribution partners, including resellers and system
integrators. Peregrine believes that these transaction partners are extremely
important influencers of customer purchase decisions, particularly purchase
decisions by large enterprise customers. If the number or size of Peregrine's
partner-sourced or partner-influenced transactions were to decrease for any
reason, Peregrine's revenue growth rates and operating results would be
materially and adversely affected. If Peregrine's sales through these indirect
channels, or to new distributors, resellers, or strategic partners, were to
decrease in a given quarter, Peregrine's total revenues and operating results
could be harmed. Sales through indirect channels, including distributors, third
party resellers, and system integrators, represent a significant percentage of
Peregrine's total sales, and this percentage has increased in recent periods.
Peregrine expects this trend to continue in the future. As a result, Peregrine
could experience a shortfall in its revenues, or a substantial decline in its
rate of revenue growth, if sales through these channels were to decrease or were
to increase at a slower rate than recently experienced. Peregrine has less
ability to manage sales through indirect channels, relative to direct sales, and
less visibility about its partners' success in selling its products. In
addition, many of Peregrine's distribution arrangements are non-exclusive, and
these distributors may carry competing products. As a result, Peregrine could
experience unforeseen variability in its revenues and operating results for a
number of reasons, including the following: inability of Peregrine's partners to
sell its products; a decision by Peregrine's partners to favor competing
products; or inability of Peregrine's partners to manage the timing of their
purchases from Peregrine against their sales to end-users, resulting in
inventories of unsold licenses held by partners.

    PEREGRINE'S QUARTERLY AND ANNUAL REVENUES AND REVENUE GROWTH RATES ARE
DEPENDENT ON THE BUDGETING CYCLES AND INVESTMENT CYCLES OF ITS CUSTOMERS.

    Peregrine's quarter-to-quarter revenues will depend on customer budgeting
cycles. If Peregrine's customers change their budgeting cycles, or reduce their
capital spending on technology, Peregrine's revenues could decline. Many
analysts predict substantially slower growth rates for, and potential reductions
in, information technology capital investment in 2001 and potentially continuing
in 2002. Moreover, many software companies, including Peregrine, have
experienced increasing reluctance by customers to make substantial investments
in new technologies. To the extent these projections prove accurate, Peregrine
expects its quarterly revenues and operating results will be adversely affected.
Peregrine has been highly dependent on its SERVICECENTER, ASSETCENTER and
FACILITYCENTER product lines to maintain its revenue growth rates, and Peregrine
expects its dependence on these product lines to continue. If the capital
investment downturn continues or worsens, Peregrine may experience reduced
demand for these core products as well, which could have a material and adverse
effect on Peregrine's revenues, operating results, financial condition, and
stock price. Most software companies, including Peregrine, currently have very
limited visibility with respect to their near term quarters and are having
difficulty predicting their revenues and operating results during these periods.

    PEREGRINE'S QUARTERLY AND ANNUAL REVENUES AND REVENUE GROWTH RATES COULD BE
AFFECTED BY NEW PRODUCTS PEREGRINE ANNOUNCES OR THAT PEREGRINE'S COMPETITORS
ANNOUNCE.

    Announcements of new products or releases by Peregrine or its competitors
could cause customers to delay purchases pending the introduction of the new
product or release. In addition, announcements by Peregrine or its competitors
concerning pricing policies could have an adverse effect on Peregrine's revenues
in a given quarter.

    PEREGRINE'S PRODUCTS HAVE DIFFERENT MARGINS, AND CHANGES IN PEREGRINE'S
PRODUCT MIX COULD HAVE AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON PEREGRINE'S OPERATING RESULTS.

    Changes in Peregrine's product mix could adversely affect Peregrine's
operating results because some products provide higher margins than others. For
example, margins on software licenses tend to be higher than margins on
maintenance and services. Cancellations of licenses, subscriptions or
maintenance contracts could reduce Peregrine's revenues and adversely affect its
operating results. In particular, Peregrine's maintenance contracts with
customers terminate on an annual basis. Substantial cancellations of maintenance
or subscription agreements, or a substantial failure to renew these contracts,
would reduce Peregrine's revenues and impact its operating results.

    THE LONG SALES CYCLE FOR PEREGRINE'S PRODUCTS MAY CAUSE SUBSTANTIAL
FLUCTUATIONS IN PEREGRINE'S REVENUES AND OPERATING RESULTS.

    Delays in customer orders could result in Peregrine's revenues being
substantially below the expectations of market analysts. The planning and
purchase decisions of Peregrine's customers involve a significant commitment of
resources and a lengthy evaluation and product qualification process. As a
result, Peregrine may incur substantial sales and marketing expenses during a
particular period in an effort to obtain orders. If Peregrine is unsuccessful in
generating offsetting revenues during that period, Peregrine's revenues and
earnings would be substantially reduced, and Peregrine could experience a large
loss. The sales cycle for Peregrine's products typically takes four to nine
months to complete, and Peregrine may experience delays that further extend this
period. The length of the sales cycle may be extended beyond four to nine months
due to factors over which Peregrine has little or no control, including the size
of the transaction and the level of competition Peregrine encounters. The
average size of Peregrine's license transactions has increased in recent periods
as Peregrine has generated an increasingly larger percentage of its revenues
from a limited number of large, enterprise customers. This trend, should it
continue, could have the effect of further extending Peregrine's sales cycle.
During its sales cycle, Peregrine typically provides a significant level of
education to prospective customers regarding the use and benefits of its
products. Any delay in the sales cycle of a large license or a number of smaller
licenses could have an adverse effect on Peregrine's operating results and
financial condition.

    SEASONAL TRENDS IN SALES OF PEREGRINE'S SOFTWARE PRODUCTS MAY RESULT IN
PERIODIC REDUCTIONS IN PEREGRINE'S REVENUES AND IMPAIRMENT OF ITS OPERATING
RESULTS.

    Seasonality in Peregrine's business could result in Peregrine's revenues in
a given period being less than market estimates. Seasonality could also result
in quarter-to-quarter decreases in Peregrine's revenues. In either of these
events, seasonality could have an adverse impact on Peregrine's results of
operations. Historically, Peregrine's revenues and operating results in the
December quarter have tended to benefit, relative to Peregrine's June and
September quarters, from purchase decisions made by the large concentration of
Peregrine's customers with calendar year-end budgeting requirements. Peregrine's
June and September quarters tend to be its weakest. Revenues and operating
results in the March quarter have tended to benefit from the efforts of
Peregrine's sales force to meet fiscal year-end sales quotas. Notwithstanding
these seasonal factors, other factors, including those identified in this
section, could still result in reduced revenues or operating results in
Peregrine's December and March quarters. For example, Peregrine may not
experience the typical increase in demand in its December quarter if the
downturn in capital spending and technology investment continues through the end
of 2001 or beyond. In addition, Peregrine's pending acquisition of Remedy could
have an adverse effect on revenues during these periods if customers defer
purchases as a result of uncertainty about the merger or in order to determine
how Peregrine and Remedy will integrate their product lines. In addition,
historical patterns may change over time, particularly as Peregrine's operations
become larger and the sources of Peregrine's revenue change or become more
diverse. For example, Peregrine's international operations have expanded
significantly in recent years, particularly in Europe. Peregrine also has an
international presence in the Pacific Rim and Latin America. Peregrine may
experience variability in demand associated with seasonal buying patterns in
these foreign markets. As an example, Peregrine's September quarter is typically
weaker in part due to the European summer holiday season.

    PEREGRINE'S JUNE 2000 ACQUISITION OF HARBINGER CORPORATION MAY REDUCE
PEREGRINE'S REVENUE GROWTH RATES AND MAKE PREDICTION OF PEREGRINE'S FUTURE
REVENUES AND OPERATING RESULTS MORE DIFFICULT AS PEREGRINE INTEGRATES THE
BUSINESSES AND ATTEMPTS TO FOCUS THE STRATEGIC MODEL OF THE COMBINED COMPANY.

    In June 2000, Peregrine acquired Harbinger Corporation, a leading worldwide
provider of business-to-business e-commerce products and services. Harbinger's
revenues prior to the acquisition were growing at a substantially slower rate
than Peregrine's revenues, due in large part to declining revenues for
Harbinger's legacy electronic commerce software business. If Peregrine's efforts
to refocus Harbinger's business and integrate it with that of Peregrine are not
successful, Peregrine's future revenue growth rates could be substantially less
than Peregrine's historic growth rates, and Peregrine's future revenues and
operating results could be impaired. Peregrine has already begun to de-emphasize
and discontinue certain businesses of Harbinger that Peregrine does not believe
are strategic to the combined company. In September 2000, Peregrine completed
the sale of one of Harbinger's product lines and Peregrine may determine to sell
or discontinue other Harbinger products or businesses in the future. Peregrine
expects this recent divestiture and any future discontinuations or divestitures
will result in revenue reductions that may not be offset by revenues from other
sources.

    In particular, Peregrine's future revenue and operating results may be
adversely affected by the Harbinger acquisition and subsequent integration
processes for a number of reasons, including the following:

    - Revenues for Harbinger's e-commerce software products may continue to
      decline, and Peregrine may not be able to offset these declines with
      increased revenues from its infrastructure management or other product
      lines.

    - Harbinger's web-based supply catalog and vertical supply businesses are
      still in their early stages, and a sustainable market may not develop for
      these services as offered by Peregrine's e-markets group.

    HARBINGER AND SOME OF ITS FORMER OFFICERS AND DIRECTORS ARE DEFENDANTS IN
SHAREHOLDER LITIGATION FOR WHICH NEITHER PEREGRINE NOR HARBINGER IS INSURED. THE
OUTCOME OF THIS LITIGATION, IF DETERMINED ADVERSELY TO HARBINGER, COULD HAVE A
MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON PEREGRINE'S FINANCIAL CONDITION.

    In September 1999, a complaint was filed against Harbinger and some of its
then-current and former officers and directors in the United States District
Court for the Northern District of Georgia. The complaint alleges that the
defendants misrepresented or omitted material facts in violation of federal
securities laws. An amended complaint was filed in March 2000, expanding upon
the allegations of the initial complaint by, among other things, alleging
accounting improprieties. The complaint relates to actions by Harbinger during
the period from February 1998 to October 1998. Harbinger did not maintain
directors' and officers' liability insurance during this period. As a result,
Peregrine is not insured with respect to any potential liability of Harbinger or
any officer or director of Harbinger. Harbinger was, however, obligated under
agreements with each of its officers and directors to indemnify them for the
costs incurred in connection with defending themselves against this litigation
and is obligated to indemnify them to the maximum extent permitted under
applicable law if they are held liable. In connection with Peregrine's
acquisition of Harbinger, Peregrine agreed to honor these contractual
arrangements.

    In October 2000, Peregrine entered into an agreement in principle to settle
this class action lawsuit. If the settlement is finalized and approved by the
court, Peregrine will be required to make an aggregate cash payment of
$2.25 million to a class of former shareholders of Harbinger in exchange for
dismissal of all claims against Harbinger. Although the parties to the
litigation have agreed in principle to this settlement, final settlement is
subject to further documentation, various contingencies, and approval by the
court. The court may not approve the settlement. If the court does not approve
the

settlement, the plaintiffs in the lawsuit may proceed with their claims, without
prejudice. It is also possible that if the settlement is approved by the court,
claims could be pursued by class members who opt out of the class settlement by
filing appropriate notices with the court. If the litigation were to continue to
proceed, Peregrine could be required to spend substantial sums in an effort to
litigate this matter. Continued litigation would be likely to result in a
diversion of management's time and attention away from business operations. If
the litigation were decided adversely to Harbinger, or if Peregrine were to
agree in the future to settle this litigation for a substantial sum as a result
of failure to obtain court approval of the pending settlement or for any other
reason, Peregrine's financial condition and results of operations could be
materially and adversely affected.

    PEREGRINE COULD EXPERIENCE LOSSES AS A RESULT OF PEREGRINE'S STRATEGIC
INVESTMENTS.

    If Peregrine's strategic investments in other companies are not successful,
Peregrine could incur losses. Peregrine has made and expects to continue to make
minority investments in companies with businesses or technologies that Peregrine
considers to be complementary to its business or technologies. These investments
have generally been made by issuing shares of Peregrine's common stock or by
paying cash. Many of these investments are in companies whose operations are not
yet sufficient to establish them as profitable concerns. Adverse changes in
market conditions or poor operating results of underlying investments could
result in Peregrine's incurring losses or Peregrine's being unable to recover
the carrying value of its investments. For example, during fiscal 2001,
Peregrine recognized impairment charges totalling $490 million, associated
principally with impairment of acquired assets but to a lesser extent with
strategic investments. Peregrine will continue to monitor the value of these
investments and may have additional impairment charges in the future.

    PEREGRINE'S BUSINESS AND OPERATING RESULTS WILL BE HARMED IF PEREGRINE
CANNOT COMPETE EFFECTIVELY AGAINST OTHER COMPANIES.

    The markets for Peregrine's products are intensely competitive and diverse,
and the technologies for Peregrine's products can change rapidly. New products
are introduced frequently and existing products are continually enhanced.
Peregrine faces competition from a number of companies offering infrastructure
resource management, procurement and e-business connectivity solutions.
Peregrine faces competition from numerous companies that offer products that
compete with one or more of Peregrine's products and services. With respect to
Peregrine's infrastructure management products, these competitors include
software companies as well as information technology and system management
companies, such as Applix, Blue Ocean, Computer Associates, Control Software (a
division of CSI-Maximus), FrontRange, Hewlett-Packard, IBM, Intraware, Main
Control, Microsoft, MRO Software (formerly Project Software and Development
Inc.), Network Associates, Nortel, PeopleSoft, Remedy, and Royal Blue
Technologies. Peregrine's e-commerce enablement technology faces competition
from providers of customer relationship portals, such as Aspect Communications;
providers of catalog management solutions, such as Requisite Technology;
providers of e-commerce enablement software such as webMethods; and providers of
legacy e-commerce technology and services such as SBC Communications, through
its acquisition of Sterling Commerce, and General Electric eXchange Solutions.
With respect to employee relationship management products, including procurement
and e-procurement solutions, Peregrine faces competition from established
providers of business-to-business Internet commerce solutions such as Ariba and
CommerceOne; established providers of enterprise resource planning software such
as Oracle and SAP; and numerous start-up and other entrepreneurial companies
offering products that provide one or more aspects of employee relationship
management such as self-help service offerings, or web-based knowledge
management systems.

    If Peregrine cannot compete effectively by offering products that are
comparable in functionality, ease of use and price to those of Peregrine's
competitors, Peregrine's revenues will decrease, and its operating results will
be adversely affected. Many of Peregrine's current and potential competitors
have

substantially greater financial, technical, marketing and other resources than
Peregrine has. As a result, they may be able to devote greater resources than
Peregrine can to the development, promotion and sale of their products, and they
may be able to respond more quickly to new or emerging technologies and changes
in customer needs.

    Additional competition from new entrepreneurial companies or established
companies extending their product lines could have an adverse effect on
Peregrine's business, revenues and operating results. In addition, alliances
among companies that are not currently direct competitors could create new
competitors with substantial market presence. Because few barriers to entry
exist in the software industry, Peregrine anticipates additional competition
from new and established companies as well as business alliances. Peregrine
expects that the software industry will continue to consolidate. In particular,
Peregrine expects that large software companies will continue to acquire or
establish alliances with Peregrine's smaller competitors, thereby increasing the
resources available to those competitors. These new competitors or alliances
could rapidly acquire significant market share at Peregrine's expense.

    PEREGRINE MAY EXPERIENCE INTEGRATION OR OTHER PROBLEMS WITH NEW
ACQUISITIONS, WHICH COULD HAVE AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON PEREGRINE'S BUSINESS OR
RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. NEW ACQUISITIONS COULD DILUTE THE INTERESTS OF EXISTING
STOCKHOLDERS, AND THE ANNOUNCEMENT OF NEW ACQUISITIONS COULD RESULT IN A DECLINE
IN THE PRICE OF PEREGRINE'S COMMON STOCK.

    In addition to the acquisition of Harbinger, Peregrine has made a number of
acquisitions of businesses and technologies over the last three years, and
Peregrine expects to continue to make acquisitions as part of its growth
strategy. Peregrine is frequently in formal or informal discussions with
potential acquisition candidates. Accordingly, Peregrine may in the future make
acquisitions of, or large investments in, businesses that offer products,
services and technologies that Peregrine believes would complement its products
or services. Peregrine also may make acquisitions of or investments in
businesses that Peregrine believes could expand its distribution channels. Even
though Peregrine announces an acquisition, Peregrine may not be able to complete
it. Any future acquisition or substantial investment would present numerous
risks. The following are examples of these risks:

    - difficulty in combining the technology, operations or work force of the
      acquired business;

    - disruption of Peregrine's on-going business;

    - difficulty in realizing the potential financial or strategic benefits of
      the transaction;

    - difficulty in maintaining uniform standards, controls, procedures and
      policies;

    - possible impairment of relationships with employees and customers as a
      result of integration of new businesses and management personnel; and

    - impairment of assets related to resulting goodwill.

    Peregrine expects that future acquisitions could provide for consideration
to be paid in cash, shares of Peregrine's common stock, or a combination of cash
and Peregrine's common stock. If the consideration for the transaction were paid
in common stock, this would further dilute Peregrine's existing stockholders. In
addition, Peregrine may raise additional equity or debt capital to finance cash
acquisitions. Raising additional equity capital would further dilute the
interests of Peregrine's existing stockholders, and additional debt could impair
Peregrine's operating results and financial condition. Additional financing may
not be available when and as needed on commercially reasonable terms, if at all.
If an inability to obtain financing were to preclude Peregrine from making an
acquisition or completing a previously announced acquisition, Peregrine's future
operating results could be adversely affected, and its stock price could fall.

    PEREGRINE'S FUTURE REVENUES AND OPERATING RESULTS MAY BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED
IF THE SOFTWARE APPLICATION INDUSTRY CONTINUES TO EVOLVE TOWARD A
SUBSCRIPTION-BASED MODEL, WHICH MAY PROVE LESS PROFITABLE FOR PEREGRINE.

    Peregrine expects its revenue growth rates and operating results to be
adversely affected as customers require Peregrine to offer its products under a
subscription-based application service provider model. Historically, Peregrine
has sold its infrastructure management solutions on a perpetual license basis in
exchange for an up-front license fee. Customers are increasingly attempting to
reduce their up-front capital expenditures by purchasing software applications
under a hosted subscription service model. Under the hosted model, the customer
subscribes to use an application from the software provider. The application is
generally hosted on a server managed by the software provider or a third-party
hosting service. Peregrine expects that a substantial portion of future revenues
generated by its e-markets group will be realized under a subscription-based
model. Peregrine also expects that an increasing portion of future revenues
generated by its infrastructure management group may be represented by
subscriptions.

    Under the subscription revenue model, Peregrine generally will recognize
revenue and receive payment ratably over the term of a customer's subscription.
As a result, Peregrine's rates of revenue growth under a subscription model may
be less than Peregrine's historical rates under a license model. In addition,
the price of Peregrine's services will be fixed at the time of entering into the
subscription agreement. If Peregrine is unable to adequately predict the costs
associated with maintaining and servicing a customer's subscription, then the
periodic expenses associated with a subscription may exceed the revenues
Peregrine recognizes for the subscription in the same period, which would
adversely affect Peregrine's operating results.

    In addition, if Peregrine is not successful in implementing the subscription
revenue model, or if market analysts or investors do not believe that the model
is attractive relative to Peregrine's traditional license model, Peregrine's
business could be impaired, and its stock price could decline dramatically.

    IF PEREGRINE, OR THIRD PARTIES ON WHICH PEREGRINE WILL RELY, ARE UNABLE TO
ADEQUATELY DELIVER PEREGRINE'S INTERNET-BASED APPLICATIONS, PEREGRINE'S
OPERATING RESULTS MAY BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED.

    Peregrine currently uses its own servers to deliver its Internet-based
products to customers. Peregrine has, however, entered into agreements with a
third party to provide a full complement of services that will enable Peregrine
to outsource the delivery of these Internet-based products to its customers. For
example, Peregrine's third-party service providers will manage the application
servers, maintain communications equipment, manage the network data centers
where Peregrine's software and data will be stored, and provide client support.
If Peregrine is unable to adequately deliver its Internet-based applications,
Peregrine may lose customers or be unable to attract new customers, which would
adversely affect Peregrine's revenues.

    In addition, the third-party service providers that Peregrine engages may
not deliver adequate support or service to Peregrine's clients, which may harm
Peregrine's reputation and its business. Because these third-party service
providers handle the installation of the computer and communications equipment
and software needed for the day-to-day operations of Peregrine's Internet-based
applications, Peregrine will be dependent on them to manage, maintain and
provide adequate security for customer applications. If Peregrine's customers
experience any delays in response time or other performance problems while using
Peregrine's Internet applications, as hosted by a third-party or by Peregrine,
Peregrine's customers may perceive the delays as defects with Peregrine's
products and may stop using these applications, which would adversely affect
Peregrine's revenues.

    Peregrine has limited experience outsourcing these services and may have
difficulty managing this process. Peregrine will be required to monitor its
third-party service providers to ensure that they perform these services
adequately. In addition, if Peregrine does not maintain good relations with
these

third-party service providers, or if they go out of business, they may be unable
to perform critical support functions for Peregrine. If Peregrine were unable to
find replacement third-party service providers, Peregrine would be required to
perform these functions itself. Peregrine may not be successful in obtaining or
performing these services on a timely or cost-effective basis.

    IF PEREGRINE DOES NOT RESPOND ADEQUATELY TO ITS INDUSTRY'S EVOLVING
TECHNOLOGY STANDARDS, OR DOES NOT CONTINUALLY DEVELOP PRODUCTS THAT MEET THE
COMPLEX AND EVOLVING NEEDS OF ITS CUSTOMERS, SALES OF ITS PRODUCTS MAY DECREASE.

    As a result of rapid technological change in Peregrine's industry,
Peregrine's competitive position with respect to its current or future product
offerings, can be eroded rapidly by product advances and technological changes.
Peregrine may be unable to improve the performance and features of its products
as necessary to respond to these developments. In addition, the life cycles of
Peregrine's products are difficult to estimate. Peregrine's growth and future
financial performance depend in part on Peregrine's ability to improve existing
products and develop and introduce new products that keep pace with
technological advances, meet changing customer needs, and respond to competitive
products. Peregrine's product development efforts will continue to require
substantial investments. In addition, competitive or technological developments
may require Peregrine to make substantial, unanticipated investments in new
products and technologies, and Peregrine may not have sufficient resources to
make these investments.

    IF PEREGRINE CANNOT ATTRACT AND RETAIN QUALIFIED SALES PERSONNEL, SOFTWARE
DEVELOPERS AND CUSTOMER SERVICE PERSONNEL, PEREGRINE WILL NOT BE ABLE TO SELL
AND SUPPORT ITS PRODUCTS.

    Competition for qualified employees is intense, particularly in the
technology industry, and Peregrine has in the past experienced difficulty
recruiting qualified employees. If Peregrine is not successful in attracting and
retaining qualified sales personnel, software developers, and customer service
personnel, Peregrine's revenue growth rates could decrease, or its revenues
could decline, and its operating results could be materially harmed. Peregrine's
products and services require a sophisticated selling effort targeted at several
key people within a prospective customer's organization. This process requires
the efforts of experienced sales personnel as well as specialized consulting
professionals. In addition, the complexity of Peregrine's products, and issues
associated with installing and maintaining them, require highly-trained customer
service and support personnel. Peregrine intends to hire a significant number of
these personnel in the future and train them in the use of its products.
Peregrine believes that its success will depend in large part on its ability to
attract and retain these key employees.

    IF IMMIGRATION LAWS LIMIT PEREGRINE'S ABILITY TO RECRUIT AND EMPLOY SKILLED
TECHNICAL PROFESSIONALS FROM OTHER COUNTRIES, PEREGRINE'S BUSINESS AND OPERATING
RESULTS COULD BE HARMED.

    Limitations under United States immigration laws could prevent Peregrine
from recruiting skilled technical personnel from foreign countries, which could
harm Peregrine's business if it does not have sufficient personnel to develop
new products and respond to technological changes. This inability to hire
technical personnel could lead to future decreases in Peregrine's revenues, or
decreases in Peregrine's revenue growth rates, either of which would adversely
affect Peregrine's operating results. Because of severe shortages for qualified
technical personnel in the United States, many companies, including Peregrine,
have recruited engineers and other technical personnel from foreign countries.
Foreign computer professionals such as those Peregrine has employed typically
become eligible for employment in the United States by obtaining a nonimmigrant
visa. The number of nonimmigrant visas is limited annually by federal
immigration laws. In recent years, despite increases in the number of available
visas, the annual allocation has been exhausted well before year-end.

    PEREGRINE'S BUSINESS COULD BE HARMED IF IT LOST THE SERVICES OF ONE OR MORE
MEMBERS OF ITS SENIOR MANAGEMENT TEAM.

    The loss of the services of one or more of Peregrine's executive officers or
key employees, or the decision of one or more of these individuals to join a
competitor, could adversely affect Peregrine's business and harm its operating
results and financial condition. Peregrine's success depends to a significant
extent on the continued service of its senior management and other key sales,
consulting, technical and marketing personnel. None of Peregrine's senior
management is bound by an employment or non-competition agreement. Peregrine
does not maintain key man life insurance on any of Peregrine's employees.

    IF PEREGRINE FAILS TO MANAGE EXPANSION EFFECTIVELY, THIS WILL PLACE A
SIGNIFICANT STRAIN ON PEREGRINE'S MANAGEMENT AND OPERATIONAL RESOURCES.

    Peregrine's recent growth rates, together with integration efforts resulting
from Peregrine's numerous acquisitions, have placed a significant strain on
Peregrine's management and operational resources. Peregrine has expanded the
size and geographic scope of its operations rapidly in recent years, both
internally and through acquisitions, and intends to continue to expand in order
to pursue market opportunities that its management believes are attractive.
Peregrine's customer relationships could be strained if it is unable to devote
sufficient resources to them as a result of Peregrine's growth, which could have
an adverse effect on Peregrine's future revenues and operating results.

    PEREGRINE MAY BE UNABLE TO EXPAND ITS BUSINESS AND INCREASE ITS REVENUES IF
PEREGRINE IS UNABLE TO EXPAND ITS DISTRIBUTION CHANNELS.

    If Peregrine is unable to expand its distribution channels effectively, its
business, revenues and operating results could be harmed. In particular,
Peregrine will need to expand its direct sales force and establish relationships
with additional system integrators, resellers and other third party partners who
market and sell Peregrine's products. If Peregrine cannot establish these
relationships, or if Peregrine's partners are unable to market Peregrine's
products effectively or provide cost-effective customer support and service,
Peregrine's revenues and operating results will be harmed. Even where Peregrine
is successful in establishing a new third-party relationship, Peregrine's
agreement with the third party may not be exclusive, and as a result,
Peregrine's partner may carry competing product lines.

    IF PEREGRINE IS UNABLE TO EXPAND ITS BUSINESS INTERNATIONALLY, PEREGRINE'S
BUSINESS, REVENUES AND OPERATING RESULTS COULD BE HARMED.

    In order to grow Peregrine's business, increase its revenues, and improve
its operating results, Peregrine believes it must continue to expand
internationally. If Peregrine expends substantial resources pursuing an
international strategy and is not successful, Peregrine's revenues will be less
than Peregrine's management or market analysts anticipate, and Peregrine's
operating results will suffer. International revenues represented approximately
36%, 41% and 36% of Peregrine's business in fiscal 1999, 2000 and 2001,
respectively. Peregrine has several international sales offices in Europe as
well as offices in Japan, Singapore, Australia and elsewhere. International
expansion will require significant management attention and financial resources,
and Peregrine may not be successful expanding its international operations.
Peregrine has limited experience in developing local language versions of its
products or in marketing its products to international customers. Peregrine may
not be able to successfully translate, market, sell, and deliver its products
internationally.

    CONDUCTING BUSINESS INTERNATIONALLY POSES RISKS THAT COULD AFFECT
PEREGRINE'S FINANCIAL RESULTS.

    Even if Peregrine is successful in expanding its operations internationally,
conducting business outside North America poses many risks that could adversely
affect its operating results. In particular, Peregrine may experience gains and
losses resulting from fluctuations in currency exchange rates, for which hedging
activities may not adequately protect Peregrine. Moreover, exchange rate risks
can have an adverse effect on Peregrine's ability to sell its products in
foreign markets. Where Peregrine sells its products in U.S. dollars, Peregrine's
sales could be adversely affected by declines in foreign currencies relative to
the dollar, thereby making Peregrine's products more expensive in local
currencies. Where Peregrine sells its products in local currencies, Peregrine
could be competitively unable to change its prices to reflect fluctuations in
the exchange rate. In recent periods, for example, Peregrine's revenues in
Europe were adversely affected by declines in the value of the Euro and its
component currencies relative to the U.S. dollar.

    Additional risks Peregrine faces in conducting business internationally
include the following:

    - longer payment cycles;

    - difficulties in staffing and managing international operations;

    - problems in collecting accounts receivable; and

    - the adverse effects of tariffs, duties, price controls or other
      restrictions that impair trade.

    PEREGRINE'S REVENUES, OPERATING RESULTS, AND STOCK PRICE COULD BE ADVERSELY
AFFECTED IF PEREGRINE WERE UNABLE TO CONDUCT ITS BUSINESS. IN PARTICULAR,
PEREGRINE'S ADMINISTRATIVE FACILITIES AND PRINCIPAL BUSINESS OPERATIONS ARE
LOCATED IN CALIFORNIA, AND ANY DISRUPTION IN THE AVAILABLE POWER SUPPLY IN
CALIFORNIA COULD DISRUPT PEREGRINE'S OPERATIONS, REDUCE ITS REVENUES, AND
INCREASE ITS EXPENSES.

    Peregrine's operations, and those of third parties on which Peregrine
relies, are vulnerable to interruption by fire, earthquake, power loss,
telecommunications failure and other events beyond Peregrine's control. A
substantial portion of Peregrine's operating activities and facilities,
including its headquarters and principal administrative facilities, are located
in the State of California. California is in the midst of an energy crisis that
could interrupt Peregrine's power supply or that of Peregrine's third-party
service providers and thereby disrupt Peregrine's operations and increase
Peregrine's expenses. In the event of an acute power shortage, California has
implemented, and may in the future continue to implement, rolling blackouts
throughout the state. In the event these blackouts continue or increase in
severity, they could disrupt the operations of one or more of Peregrine's
facilities. Peregrine currently maintains back-up generators of power in the
event of a blackout. Although Peregrine's current insurance provides some
coverage for any damages Peregrine, but not Peregrine's customers, may suffer as
a result of any interruption in Peregrine's power supply, it may prove
insufficient to cover any damages Peregrine might incur. Peregrine is in the
process of developing a plan to permit Peregrine to continue to operate critical
functions based in California during a blackout. Despite these precautions,
Peregrine may experience an interruption in its power supply. If blackouts or
other forces interrupt Peregrine's power supply, Peregrine would be temporarily
unable to continue operations at its facilities. Any interruption in Peregrine's
ability to continue operations at its facilities could damage its reputation,
harm its ability to retain existing customers and to obtain new customers, and
could result in lost revenue, any of which could substantially harm Peregrine's
business and results of operations.

    In addition, the utility deregulation program instituted in 1996 by the
California government deregulated wholesale prices while continuing to regulate
the retail prices charged by the electrical utilities. While wholesale prices
have increased dramatically, retail prices have, until recently, not increased
at comparable rates. Peregrine's business is substantially dependent on the
availability and price of electricity. If retail electricity prices rise
dramatically, Peregrine expects its expenses will increase, its operating
results will be harmed, and its stock price could fall.

    PEREGRINE'S OUTSTANDING INDEBTEDNESS COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT ITS RESULTS OF
OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION, AND PEREGRINE MAY INCUR SUBSTANTIALLY MORE
DEBT.

    As of the date of this report, Peregrine has approximately $265 million of
indebtedness outstanding, consisting principally of its 5 1/2% convertible
subordinated notes due 2007. Peregrine's indebtedness could adversely affect its
results of operations and financial condition. For example, Peregrine's results
of operations will be adversely affected by approximately $15 million in annual
interest expenses, payable semi-annually. In addition, Peregrine's indebtedness
could:

    - increase Peregrine's vulnerability to general adverse economic and
      industry conditions;

    - limit Peregrine's ability to obtain additional financing;

    - limit Peregrine's flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in
      Peregrine's business and the industry; and

    - place Peregrine at a competitive disadvantage relative to its competitors
      with less debt.

    Peregrine's indebtedness will require the dedication of a substantial
portion of its cash flow from operations to the payment of principal and
interest on its indebtedness, thereby reducing the availability of the cash flow
to fund its growth strategy, working capital, capital expenditures and other
general corporate purposes.

    Peregrine may incur substantial additional debt in the future. The terms of
Peregrine's existing indebtedness does not, and future indebtedness may not,
prohibit Peregrine from doing so. If new debt is added to Peregrine's current
levels, the related risks described above could intensify.

    PEREGRINE MAY HAVE INSUFFICIENT CASH FLOW TO MEET ITS DEBT SERVICE
OBLIGATIONS.

    Peregrine will be required to generate cash sufficient to pay all amounts
due on its outstanding indebtedness and to conduct its business operations.
Peregrine has incurred net losses, and Peregrine may not be able to cover its
anticipated debt service obligations. This may materially hinder Peregrine's
ability to make payments on its indebtedness. Peregrine's ability to meet its
future debt service obligations will be dependent upon Peregrine's future
operating performance, which will be subject to financial, business and other
factors affecting Peregrine's operations, many of which are beyond Peregrine's
control.

    PEREGRINE HAS MADE SUBSTANTIAL CAPITAL COMMITMENTS THAT COULD HAVE AN
ADVERSE EFFECT ON ITS OPERATING RESULTS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION IF PEREGRINE'S
BUSINESS DOES NOT GROW.

    Peregrine has made substantial capital commitments as a result of recent
growth in Peregrine's business that could seriously harm Peregrine's financial
condition if its business does not grow and it does not have adequate resources
to satisfy its obligations. In June 1999, Peregrine entered into a series of
leases covering up to 540,000 square feet of office space, including an option
on approximately 118,000 square feet for its headquarters in San Diego,
California. The office space (including the option) relates to a five building
campus in San Diego, California, of which four buildings are presently occupied.
Peregrine's San Diego personnel occupy three of these buildings and Peregrine
subleases part of the fourth building. In June 2001, Peregrine exercised its
option for the fifth and final building at the San Diego campus, which is
scheduled to be completed in October 2002. Including the exercise of the option,
the leases require minimum aggregate lease payments of approximately
$201.2 million over their term, which is approximately twelve years. In
addition, Peregrine leases approximately 95,000 square feet of space in Atlanta,
Georgia, principally for Peregrine's e-markets group, under a lease expiring in
2008, and is also obligated under additional lease facilities for significant
office space throughout North America, Europe, and the Pacific Rim. These
capital commitments, construction

oversight, and movement of personnel and facilities involved in transactions of
these types and magnitude present numerous risks, including:

    - failure to properly estimate the future growth of its business;

    - inability to sublease excess office space if Peregrine overestimates
      future growth;

    - disruption of operations; and

    - inability to match fixed lease payments with fluctuating revenues, which
      could impair Peregrine's earnings or result in losses.

    PEREGRINE MAY NEED TO OBTAIN ADDITIONAL FINANCING IN THE FUTURE, WHICH MAY
NOT BE AVAILABLE ON FAVORABLE TERMS.

    As of March 31, 2001, Peregrine had cash and cash equivalents totalling
$286.7 million. Based on Remedy's outstanding shares as of June 7, 2001,
Peregrine expects to pay out approximately $274.5 million as cash merger
consideration. As a result of the aquisition, Peregrine will acquire all
Remedy's cash and cash equivalents as of the date of the merger. Peregrine
currently expects these amounts, together with anticipated cash flows from
operations, to be sufficient to satisfy working capital requirements for the
next 12 months. Nevertheless, in anticipation of the use of cash for payment to
Remedy stockholders in the merger and to ensure adequate levels of working
capital for the combined company after the merger, Peregrine is considering
establishing a new bank facility or facilities. It may also consider in the
future additional financing in the form of issuances of common stock or the
issuance of debt securities, including debt securities convertible into shares
of common stock. Additional financing may not be available when and as required
on commercially reasonable terms, if at all. In addition, the issuance of
additional equity securities, including securities convertible into Peregrine's
equity securities, would dilute the interests of Peregrine's stockholders.
Issuance of additional debt securities could impair Peregrine's financial
condition as it becomes increasingly leveraged, and interest payments would be
expected to have an adverse effect on Peregrine's results of operations.

    PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT DELAYS COULD HARM PEREGRINE'S COMPETITIVE POSITION AND
REDUCE ITS REVENUES.

    If Peregrine experiences significant product development delays, Peregrine's
position in the market would be harmed, and its revenues could be substantially
reduced, which would adversely affect Peregrine's operating results. Peregrine
has experienced product development delays in the past and may experience delays
in the future. In particular, Peregrine may experience product development
delays associated with the integration of recently acquired products and
technologies. Delays may occur for many reasons, including an inability to hire
a sufficient number of developers, discovery of software bugs and errors, or a
failure of Peregrine's current or future products to conform to industry
requirements.

    ERRORS OR OTHER SOFTWARE BUGS IN PEREGRINE'S PRODUCTS COULD RESULT IN
SIGNIFICANT EXPENDITURES TO CORRECT THE ERRORS OR BUGS AND COULD RESULT IN
PRODUCT LIABILITY CLAIMS.

    If Peregrine were required to expend significant amounts to correct software
bugs or errors, Peregrine's revenues could be harmed as a result of an inability
to deliver the product, and Peregrine's operating results could be impaired as
it incurs additional costs without offsetting revenues. Errors can be detected
at any point in a product's life cycle. Peregrine has experienced errors in the
past that have resulted in delays in product shipment and increased costs.
Discovery of errors could result in any of the following:

    - loss of or delay in revenues and loss of customers or market share;

    - failure to achieve market acceptance;

    - diversion of development resources and increased development expenses;

    - increased service and warranty costs;

    - legal actions by Peregrine's customers; and

    - increased insurance costs.

    If Peregrine were held liable for damages incurred as a result of
Peregrine's products, its operating results could be significantly impaired.
Peregrine's license agreements with its customers typically contain provisions
designed to limit exposure to potential product liability claims. However, these
limitations may not be effective under the laws of some jurisdictions. Peregrine
has from time to time received complaints from customers that its software
failed to perform as promised or contained errors or bugs that resulted in
losses by its customers. Although none of these claims have proven material to
Peregrine to date, the sale and support of products as complex as those offered
by Peregrine entails the risk of material claims.

    PEREGRINE COULD BE COMPETITIVELY DISADVANTAGED IF PEREGRINE IS UNABLE TO
PROTECT ITS INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY.

    If Peregrine fails to adequately protect its proprietary rights, competitors
could offer similar products relying on technologies Peregrine developed,
potentially harming Peregrine's competitive position and decreasing Peregrine's
revenues. Peregrine attempts to protect its intellectual property rights by
limiting access to the distribution of its software, documentation, and other
proprietary information and by relying on a combination of patent, copyright,
trademark, and trade secret laws. In addition, Peregrine enters into
confidentiality agreements with its employees and certain customers, vendors,
and strategic partners. In some circumstances, however, Peregrine may, if
required by a business relationship, provide its licensees with access to its
data model and other proprietary information underlying Peregrine's licensed
applications.

    Despite precautions that Peregrine takes, it may be possible for
unauthorized third parties to copy aspects of Peregrine's current or future
products or to obtain and use information that Peregrine regards as proprietary.
Policing unauthorized use of software is difficult, and some foreign laws do not
protect proprietary rights to the same extent as United States laws. Litigation
may be necessary in the future to enforce Peregrine's intellectual property
rights, to protect its trade secrets, or to determine the validity and scope of
the proprietary rights of others, any of which could adversely affect
Peregrine's revenues and operating results.

    IF PEREGRINE BECOMES INVOLVED IN AN INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY DISPUTE, PEREGRINE
MAY INCUR SIGNIFICANT EXPENSES OR MAY BE REQUIRED TO CEASE SELLING ITS PRODUCTS,
WHICH WOULD SUBSTANTIALLY IMPAIR PEREGRINE'S REVENUES AND OPERATING RESULTS.

    In recent years, there has been significant litigation in the United States
involving intellectual property rights, including rights of companies in the
software industry. Peregrine has from time to time in the past received
correspondence from third parties alleging that Peregrine infringes the third
party's intellectual property rights. Peregrine expects these claims to increase
as Peregrine and its intellectual property portfolio become larger. Intellectual
property claims against Peregrine, and any resulting lawsuit, may result in
Peregrine incurring significant expenses and could subject Peregrine to
significant liability for damages and invalidate what Peregrine currently
believes are Peregrine's proprietary rights. These lawsuits, regardless of their
success, would likely be time-consuming and expensive to resolve and could
divert management's time and attention. Any potential intellectual property
litigation against Peregrine could also force Peregrine to do one or more of the
following:

    - cease selling, incorporating or using products or services that
      incorporate the infringed intellectual property;

    - obtain from the holder of the infringed intellectual property a license to
      sell or use the relevant technology, which license may not be available on
      acceptable terms, if at all; or

    - redesign those products or services that incorporate the disputed
      intellectual property, which could result in substantial unanticipated
      development expenses.

    If Peregrine is subject to a successful claim of infringement and Peregrine
fails to develop non-infringing intellectual property or license the infringed
intellectual property on acceptable terms and on a timely basis, Peregrine's
revenues could decline or its expenses could increase.

    Peregrine may in the future initiate claims or litigation against third
parties for infringement of Peregrine's intellectual property rights or to
determine the scope and validity of Peregrine's proprietary rights or the
proprietary rights of competitors. These claims could also result in significant
expense and the diversion of technical and management personnel's attention.

    PROVISIONS IN PEREGRINE'S CHARTER DOCUMENTS AND DELAWARE LAW MAY DISCOURAGE
POTENTIAL ACQUISITION BIDS FOR PEREGRINE AND MAY PREVENT CHANGES IN PEREGRINE'S
MANAGEMENT THAT STOCKHOLDERS OTHERWISE WOULD APPROVE.

    Some provisions of Peregrine's charter documents eliminate the right of
stockholders to act by written consent without a meeting and impose specific
procedures for nominating directors and submitting proposals for consideration
at a stockholder meeting. These provisions are intended to increase the
likelihood of continuity and stability in the composition of Peregrine's board
of directors and the policies established by the board of directors. These
provisions also discourage some types of transactions, which may involve an
actual or threatened change of control. These provisions are designed to reduce
Peregrine's vulnerability to an unsolicited acquisition proposal. As a result,
these provisions could discourage potential acquisition proposals and could
delay or prevent a change of control transaction. These provisions are also
intended to discourage common tactics that may be used in proxy fights. As a
result, they could have the effect of discouraging third parties from making
tender offers for Peregrine's shares. These provisions may prevent the market
price of Peregrine's common stock from reflecting the effects of actual or
rumored take-over attempts. These provisions may also prevent changes in
Peregrine's management.

    Peregrine's board of directors has the authority to issue up to 5,000,000
shares of preferred stock in one or more series. The board of directors can fix
the price, rights, preference, privileges, and restrictions of this preferred
stock without any further vote or action by Peregrine's stockholders. The
issuance of preferred stock allows Peregrine to have flexibility in connection
with possible acquisitions and for other corporate purposes. The issuance of
preferred stock, however, may delay or prevent a change of control transaction.
As a result, the market price of Peregrine's common stock and other rights of
holders of Peregrine's common stock may be adversely affected, including the
loss of voting control to others.

    PEREGRINE'S STOCK PRICE HAS BEEN AND IS LIKELY TO CONTINUE TO BE HIGHLY
VOLATILE, WHICH MAY MAKE ITS COMMON STOCK DIFFICULT TO RESELL AT ATTRACTIVE
TIMES AND PRICES.

    The trading price of Peregrine's common stock has been and is likely to be
highly volatile. Peregrine's stock price could be subject to wide fluctuations
in response to a variety of factors, including the following:

    - actual or anticipated variations in Peregrine's quarterly operating
      results;

    - announcements of technological innovations;

    - new products or services offered by Peregrine or Peregrine's competitors;

    - changes in financial estimates by securities analysts;

    - conditions or trends in the software industry generally or specifically in
      the markets for infrastructure management or e-business connectivity
      solutions;

    - changes in the economic performance and/or market valuations of
      Peregrine's competitors and the software industry in general;

    - announcements by Peregrine or its competitors of significant contracts,
      changes in pricing policies, acquisitions, strategic partnerships, joint
      ventures or capital commitments;

    - adoption of industry standards and the inclusion of Peregrine's technology
      in, or compatibility of Peregrine's technology with, the standards;

    - adverse or unfavorable publicity regarding Peregrine or Peregrine's
      products;

    - Peregrine's loss of a major customer;

    - additions or departures of key personnel;

    - sales of Peregrine's common stock in the public market; and

    - other events or factors that may be beyond Peregrine's control.

    In addition, the stock markets in general, and in particular the markets for
securities of technology and software companies, have experienced extreme price
and volume volatility and a significant cumulative decline in recent months.
This volatility has affected many companies irrespective of or
disproportionately to the operating performance of these companies. These broad
market and industry factors can materially and adversely affect the market price
of Peregrine's common stock, regardless of Peregrine's actual operating
performance.

RISKS RELATING TO REMEDY

    REMEDY'S QUARTERLY OPERATING RESULTS ARE VOLATILE AND DIFFICULT TO PREDICT.
IF FUTURE RESULTS ARE BELOW THE EXPECTATIONS OF PUBLIC MARKET ANALYSTS OR
INVESTORS, THE PRICE OF REMEDY'S COMMON STOCK MAY DECLINE.

    Remedy's quarterly operating results have in the past, and may in the
future, vary significantly depending on factors such as:

    - increased competition;

    - the timing of new product announcements and changes in pricing policies by
      Remedy and its competitors;

    - market acceptance of new and enhanced versions of Remedy's products;

    - the size and timing of significant orders;

    - the mix of direct and indirect sales;

    - changes in operating expenses;

    - changes in company strategy;

    - personnel changes;

    - foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations; and

    - general economic factors.

    Remedy operates with no significant order backlog because its software
products typically are shipped or electronically downloaded over the Web shortly
after orders are received. Furthermore, Remedy has often recognized a
substantial portion of its revenue in the last month of a quarter, with

this revenue frequently concentrated in the last weeks of a quarter. As a
result, product revenue in any quarter is substantially dependent on orders
booked and shipped in that quarter and revenue for any future quarter is not
predictable with any significant degree of certainty. Product revenue is also
difficult to forecast because the market for software products is rapidly
evolving, and Remedy's sales cycle, from initial trial to multiple copy
purchases and the provision of support services, varies substantially from
customer to customer. Remedy's expense levels are based, in part, on its
expectations as to future revenue. If revenue levels are below expectations,
operating results are likely to be adversely affected. Net income may be
disproportionately affected by a reduction in revenue because a proportionately
smaller amount of Remedy's expenses varies with its revenue.

    In addition, the technology sector in which Remedy operates has experienced
a dramatic general slowdown over the past nine months as evidenced by the
decline of stock prices on the Nasdaq National Market. This macroeconomic
environment may harm Remedy's business by impacting its customers, their
spending and the rate at which they accept Remedy's products. Remedy's
operations and stock price may experience substantial fluctuations from quarter
to quarter as a consequence of this environment and other factors affecting the
timing of capital spending decisions by Remedy's customers. There can be no
assurance that these factors will not seriously harm Remedy's business,
operating results or financial position.

    As a result, Remedy believes that period-to-period comparisons of its
results of operations are not necessarily meaningful and should not be relied
upon as indications of future performance. It is likely that in some future
quarter Remedy's operating results will be below the expectations of public
market analysts and investors. If this happens, the price of Remedy's common
stock would likely decline dramatically.

    INCREASED COMPETITION IN THE MARKET FOR REMEDY'S PRODUCTS AND SERVICES COULD
SERIOUSLY HARM REMEDY'S BUSINESS, OPERATING RESULTS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION.

    The market for Remedy's products is intensely competitive, diverse and
subject to rapid change. New products are frequently introduced and existing
products are continually enhanced. Competitors vary in size and in the scope and
breadth of the products and services offered. Remedy has experienced substantial
competition from companies of all types and sizes, and these competitors
include:

    - providers of enterprise software, such as Computer Associates, FrontRange
      Solutions, Hewlett-Packard, IBM, infraWise, Interact Commerce, Intraware,
      Kana Communications, Main Control, Microsoft, Network Associates, Nortel
      Networks, Onyx Software, Oracle, PeopleSoft, Peregrine, Pivotal, Siebel
      Systems, STAFF & LINE and Viadyne Corporation; and

    - internally developed systems.

    In addition, because there are relatively low barriers to entry in the
software market, Remedy expects additional competition from other established
and emerging companies as the software market continues to develop and expand.
Increased competition could result in price reductions, reduced gross margins
and loss of market share, any of which could seriously harm Remedy's business,
operating results and financial condition. Some of Remedy's current, and many of
its potential, competitors have significantly greater financial, technical,
marketing and other resources than Remedy. As a result, they may be able to
respond more quickly to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer
requirements, or to devote greater resources to the development, promotion and
sale of their products than Remedy is able to do. In addition, current and
potential competitors have established or may establish cooperative
relationships among themselves or with third parties to increase the ability of
their products to address the needs of Remedy's prospective customers.
Accordingly, it is possible that new competitors or alliances among competitors
may emerge and rapidly acquire significant market share.

    REMEDY DERIVES SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF ITS REVENUE FROM PRODUCTS AND SERVICES
RELATED TO THE ACTION REQUEST SYSTEM.

    Remedy currently derives substantially all of its revenue from licenses of
its ACTION REQUEST SYSTEM, the applications Remedy provides that are built upon
the ACTION REQUEST SYSTEM foundation, and related services. Broad market
acceptance of these products and services is critical to Remedy's future
success. As a result, a decline in demand for or failure to achieve broad market
acceptance of the ACTION REQUEST SYSTEM foundation and applications as a result
of competition, technological change or otherwise, would seriously harm the
business, operating results and financial condition of Remedy. Remedy's future
financial performance will depend in part upon the successful development,
introduction and customer acceptance of new and enhanced versions of the ACTION
REQUEST SYSTEM foundation and other applications, specifically customer
relationship management and information technology service management
applications. There can be no assurance that Remedy will continue to be
successful in marketing the ACTION REQUEST SYSTEM or any new or enhanced
products or applications. Remedy continues to invest significant resources into
the research and development, sales and marketing of new software applications.
However, Remedy believes that its success in expanding its product line will
depend largely on new products achieving market acceptance and technological
competitiveness.

    IF REMEDY FAILS TO RESPOND TO THE EVOLVING NEEDS OF ITS CUSTOMERS IN A
TIMELY MANNER, OR IF ITS PRODUCTS DO NOT ACHIEVE MARKET ACCEPTANCE, ITS BUSINESS
WOULD BE SERIOUSLY HARMED.

    The client/server and web-based application software industry is
characterized by rapid technological change, frequent new product introductions
and evolving industry standards. The introduction of products embodying new
technologies and the emergence of new industry standards can render existing
products obsolete and unmarketable. The life cycles of Remedy's products are
difficult to estimate. Remedy's future success will depend upon its ability to
enhance its current products and to develop and introduce new products on a
timely basis that keep pace with technological developments and emerging
industry standards and address the increasingly sophisticated needs of its
customers. Since 1999, Remedy has invested significant resources into the
research and development and sales and marketing of software applications.
Remedy intends to continue to invest heavily in these efforts in the future.
There can be no assurance that Remedy will be successful in developing and
marketing product enhancements or new products that respond to technological
change, evolving industry standards and customer requirements, or that Remedy
will not experience difficulties that could delay or prevent the successful
development, introduction and marketing of these products, or that its new
products and product enhancements will adequately meet the requirements of the
marketplace and achieve market acceptance. If Remedy is unable, for
technological or other reasons, to develop and introduce new products or
enhancements of existing products in a timely manner in response to changing
market conditions or customer requirements, Remedy's business, operating results
and financial condition will be seriously harmed. If the new products currently
being developed by Remedy do not achieve market acceptance or are not released
when expected, its business, operating results and financial condition will be
seriously harmed.

    REMEDY'S SUCCESS DEPENDS ON RETAINING ITS CURRENT KEY PERSONNEL AND
ATTRACTING AND RETAINING ADDITIONAL KEY PERSONNEL.

    Remedy's future performance depends in significant part upon the continued
service of its key technical, sales and senior management personnel, none of
whom are bound by an employment agreement. The loss of the services of one or
more of its current executive officers could seriously harm its business,
operating results and financial condition. Remedy employees may question their
role with the combined company following completion of the merger. If this
occurs, Remedy may experience an increase in attrition over historical rates.
Remedy's future success also depends upon its continuing ability to attract and
retain highly qualified technical, sales and managerial personnel. Competition
for

such personnel is intense, particularly in the competitive employment market of
the Silicon Valley in California where the majority of Remedy's workforce is
located, and there can be no assurance that it can retain its key technical,
sales and managerial employees or that it can attract, assimilate or retain
other highly qualified technical, sales and managerial personnel in the future.
In particular, if Remedy is to achieve significant revenue growth in the future,
it must continue to hire additional sales personnel. In the past, Remedy has
experienced difficulty in recruiting a sufficient number of qualified sales
persons. Any failure of Remedy to attract and retain such qualified employees
could seriously harm its business, operating results and financial condition.

    REMEDY CAN HAVE A LONG SALES CYCLE, WHICH MAKES THE PREDICTION OF OPERATING
RESULTS DIFFICULT.

    Historically, Remedy made a significant number of its sales to a department
or a division of an organization. If the implementation was successful at the
departmental or divisional level, Remedy then attempted to make additional sales
into the organization either by selling other applications to the department or
division of the organization that made the initial purchase, or alternatively,
by selling to other departments or divisions of the organization. Over the past
several years, Remedy has also attempted to sell its products at the
organizational level, in which case a company would often buy multiple Remedy
products or multiple applications of the Remedy ACTION REQUEST SYSTEM and deploy
the products or applications throughout the organization. These organizational
transactions typically are larger in size than Remedy's department or divisional
sales and take longer to complete. For the quarter ended March 31, 2001,
Remedy's sales at the organizational level were significantly below its
expectations.

    Organizational customers often deploy Remedy's products in business critical
operations, which involve significant capital and management commitments by such
customers. These customers generally commit significant resources to an
evaluation of available enterprise software and require Remedy to expend
substantial time, effort and money in the sales effort. Sales of Remedy's
products to these customers require an extensive sales effort throughout a
customer's organization, because decisions to purchase the products generally
involve the evaluation of the software by a significant number of customer
personnel in various functional and geographic areas, each often having specific
and conflicting requirements. A variety of factors, including factors over which
Remedy has little or no control, may cause these potential customers to favor a
particular supplier or to delay or forego a purchase. As a result of these or
other factors, the sales cycle for Remedy's products is relatively long when
selling at the organizational level, typically ranging between three and nine
months.

    As a result of the length of the sales cycle and the significant selling
expenses resulting from selling at the organizational level, Remedy's ability to
forecast the timing and amount of specific sales is limited, and the delay or
failure to complete one or more large transactions to which Remedy has devoted
significant resources could seriously harm Remedy's business, operating results
or financial condition and could cause significant variations in its operating
results from quarter to quarter. In addition, many organizational customers have
significantly decreased their spending because of the dramatic slowdown in the
technology sector. Reduced spending has and may continue to impact Remedy's
customers' decisions to purchase Remedy's products, which has and could continue
to seriously harm Remedy's business, financial condition and results of
operations.

    REMEDY INTENDS TO RELY ON THIRD PARTIES TO IMPLEMENT ITS PRODUCTS IN SOME
CUSTOMERS.

    Remedy relies on third-party implementation providers, including integration
consulting firms and other consultants, to assist with the implementation of its
products in organizational customers and in the training of personnel within
such customers, in order to meet the demand for implementation of its product
from these customers. Remedy's operating margins may be lower as a result of the
higher expenses associated with engaging such third party service providers. In
addition, if Remedy is unable to establish and maintain effective, long-term
relationships with its implementation providers, or if

these providers do not meet the needs or expectations of its organizational
customers, its business would be seriously harmed.

    REMEDY RELIES ON INDIRECT MARKETING CHANNELS FOR A SIGNIFICANT PERCENTAGE OF
ITS TOTAL SALES.

    An integral part of Remedy's strategy is to continue to develop the
marketing channels of value-added resellers, system integrators and independent
software vendors. Value added resellers, system integrators and independent
software vendors accounted for approximately 47% of Remedy's total revenue in
the three-month period ended March 31, 2001 and approximately 47% of its total
revenue in 2000. If these marketing channels increase as a percentage of sales,
Remedy's operating margins may be seriously harmed due to the lower unit prices
that Remedy receives when selling through indirect channels.

    There can be no assurance that Remedy will be able to attract value added
resellers, system integrators and independent software vendors that will be able
to market Remedy's products effectively and will be qualified to provide timely
and cost-effective customer support and service. In addition, Remedy's
agreements with its value added resellers, system integrators and independent
software vendors are not exclusive and in many cases may be terminated by either
party without cause, and many of Remedy's value added resellers, system
integrators and independent software vendors carry competing product lines.
Therefore, there can be no assurance that any value added reseller, systems
integrator or independent software vendor will continue to represent Remedy's
products, and the inability to recruit, or the loss of important value added
resellers, system integrators and independent software vendors could seriously
harm Remedy's results of operations.

    IF REMEDY CONTINUES TO EXPAND ITS INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS ITS OPERATING
MARGINS MAY DECREASE.

    International sales represented approximately 37% of Remedy's revenue in the
three months ended March 31, 2001 and approximately 38% of Remedy's revenue for
the year ended December 31, 2000. Remedy currently has nineteen international
wholly owned subsidiaries, which primarily function as sales offices, and are
located in the United Kingdom, Ireland, Canada, Germany, France, Spain, Italy,
The Netherlands, Sweden, Singapore, Australia, Japan, Hong Kong, Brazil, Mexico,
Argentina and Switzerland. One of Remedy's strategies is to continue to expand
its existing international operations and enter additional international
markets, which will require significant management attention and financial
resources. Traditionally, international operations are characterized by higher
operating expenses and lower operating margins. As a result, if Remedy's
international revenues increase as a percentage of total revenue, its operating
margins may be seriously harmed. Costs associated with international expansion
include the establishment of additional foreign offices, the hiring of
additional personnel, the localization and marketing of its products for
particular foreign markets and the development of relationships with additional
international service providers. If Remedy's international revenue is not
adequate to offset the expense of expanding foreign operations, its business,
operating results or financial condition could be seriously harmed.

    REMEDY'S INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS EXPOSE IT TO NUMEROUS RISKS.

    Remedy's international operations are subject to risks inherent in
international business activities and generally include:

    - unexpected changes in regulatory requirements, tariffs and other trade
      barriers;

    - difficulties cultivating product acceptance in foreign countries;

    - longer accounts receivable payment cycles;

    - difficulties in managing international operations;

    - potentially adverse tax consequences including restrictions on the
      repatriation of earnings;

    - the burdens of complying with a wide variety of foreign laws;

    - currency exchange rates fluctuations; and

    - general economic conditions and political instability in foreign
      countries.

    There can be no assurance that such factors will not seriously harm Remedy's
future international sales and, consequently, its results of operations. In
addition, because a substantial majority of its international sales are
indirect, any material increase in its international sales as a percentage of
total revenue may adversely affect Remedy's average selling prices and gross
margins due to the lower unit prices that it receives when selling through
indirect channels.

    REMEDY'S ABILITY TO COMPETE EFFECTIVELY MAY BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED IF IT IS
UNABLE TO PROTECT ITS PROPRIETARY TECHNOLOGY.

    Remedy's success is heavily dependent upon proprietary technology. Remedy
relies primarily on a combination of patent, copyright and trademark laws, trade
secrets, confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions to protect its
proprietary rights. It seeks to protect its software, documentation and other
written materials under trade secret and copyright laws, which afford only
limited protection. Remedy presently has two patent applications pending. Remedy
does not know whether any of its pending or future patent applications will
result in the issuance of patents. To the extent patents have been issued or
will be issued, Remedy does not know whether these patents will be subject to
further proceedings limiting their scope, will provide significant proprietary
protection or competitive advantage, or will be circumvented or invalidated.
Despite its efforts to protect its proprietary rights, unauthorized parties may
attempt to copy aspects of Remedy's products or to obtain and use information
that Remedy regards as proprietary. Policing unauthorized use of Remedy's
products is difficult, and while it is unable to determine the extent to which
piracy of its software products exists, software piracy can be expected to be a
persistent problem. In selling its products, Remedy relies primarily on "shrink
wrap" (out-of-the-box or off-the-shelf sales) and "click wrap" (electronic sales
transmitted via the internet) licenses that are not signed by licensees and,
therefore, it is possible that such licenses may be unenforceable under the laws
of some jurisdictions. In addition, the laws of some foreign countries do not
protect proprietary rights to as great an extent as do the laws of the United
States. There can be no assurance that Remedy's means of protecting its
proprietary rights will be adequate or that its competitors will not
independently develop similar technology.

    Remedy may have to resort to litigation to protect its intellectual property
rights, to protect any issued patents, its trade secrets or know-how or to
determine their scope, validity or enforceability. Enforcing or defending its
proprietary technology is expensive, could cause the diversion of its resources,
and may not prove successful. Remedy's protective measures may prove inadequate
to protect its proprietary rights, and any failure to enforce or protect its
rights could adversely affect Remedy's ability to compete effectively.

    NEW VERSIONS AND RELEASES OF REMEDY'S PRODUCTS MAY CONTAIN ERRORS.

    Software products as complex as those offered by Remedy may contain
undetected errors or failures when first introduced or when new versions are
released. Remedy has in the past discovered software errors in certain of its
new products and enhancements after their introduction and has experienced
delays or lost revenue during the period required to correct these errors.
Although Remedy has not experienced material adverse effects resulting from any
such errors to date, there can be no assurance that, despite testing by Remedy
and by current and potential customers, errors will not be found in new products
or releases after commencement of commercial shipments, resulting in loss of or
delay in market acceptance, which could seriously harm Remedy's business,
operating results and financial condition.

    REMEDY MAY BE SUBJECT TO INFRINGEMENT AND PRODUCT LIABILITY CLAIMS THAT,
WITH OR WITHOUT MERIT, COULD BE COSTLY TO DEFEND OR SETTLE.

    Remedy is not aware that any of its products infringe the proprietary rights
of third parties. However, there can be no assurance that third parties will not
claim infringement by Remedy with respect to current or future products. Remedy
expects that software product developers will increasingly be subject to
infringement claims as the number of products and competitors in its industry
segment grows and the functionality of products in different industry segments
overlaps. Any such claims, with or without merit, could be time-consuming,
result in costly litigation, cause product shipment delays or require Remedy to
enter into royalty or licensing agreements. Such royalty or licensing
agreements, if required, may not be available on terms acceptable to Remedy or
at all, which could seriously harm its business, operating results and financial
condition.

    In addition, because Remedy's customers use its products and services to
manage their business processes and customer relationships, any errors, defects
or other performance problems in Remedy's products and services could result in
financial or other damages to Remedy's customers. Although Remedy has not
experienced any product liability claims to date, the sale and support of
products by Remedy may entail the risk of such claims. Remedy's license
agreements with its customers typically contain provisions designed to limit its
exposure to potential product liability claims. In selling its products, Remedy
relies primarily on "shrink wrap" (out-of-the-box or off-the-shelf sales) and
"click wrap" (electronic sales transmitted via the internet) licenses that are
not signed by licensees and, therefore, it is possible that such licenses may be
unenforceable under the laws of some jurisdictions. For these and other reasons,
it is possible that the limitation of liability provisions contained in its
license agreements may not be effective. A product liability claim brought
against Remedy, even if not successful, would likely be time consuming and
costly and could seriously harm Remedy's business. A successful product
liability claim brought against Remedy could seriously harm Remedy's business,
operating results and financial condition.

    THE CONVERSION OF EUROPEAN CURRENCIES INTO THE EUROPEAN UNION'S COMMON
CURRENCY COULD HARM REMEDY'S BUSINESS.

    Remedy is aware of the issues associated with the changes in Europe aimed at
forming a European Economic and Monetary Union. On January 1, 1999, certain
member countries of the European Union established fixed conversion rates
between their existing currencies and the European Union's common currency, the
Euro. On that day, the Euro became a functional legal currency within these
countries and over the next three years, business in the European Economic and
Monetary Union member states will be conducted in both the existing national
currency and the Euro. As a result, companies operating in or conducting
business in European Economic and Monetary Union member states need to ensure
that their financial and other software systems are capable of processing
transactions and properly handling these currencies, including the Euro. No
later than July 1, 2002, the participating countries will withdraw all bills and
coins denominated in the legacy currencies, so that the legacy currencies will
no longer be legal tender for any transactions, making the conversion to the
Euro complete. Remedy recognizes that by January 1, 2002, all its customers in
the participating countries in Europe will need to have converted all the values
in their databases to the Euro, having previously reflected all values in the
appropriate local currencies. At this time, it is not possible to summarize the
potential costs associated with addressing any Euro conversion issues and there
can be no assurance that these issues and their related costs will not seriously
harm Remedy's business, operating results and financial position.

RECENT SHARE PRICES

    The following table provides information about the closing sale price of
Peregrine's common stock and Remedy's common stock on June 8, 2001 and July 20,
2001. In addition, the table provides an equivalent per-share price for Remedy's
common stock on those dates based on the closing price of Peregrine's common
stock multiplied by the exchange ratio in the merger of 0.9065 of a share of
Peregrine common stock plus $9.00 in cash for each share of Remedy common stock.
June 8, 2001 was the last trading day prior to the execution and public
announcement of the merger agreement. July 20, 2001 was the last practicable
trading day prior to the mailing of this proxy statement/prospectus.

    No assurance can be given as to the market prices of Peregrine's common
stock or Remedy's common stock at any time prior to the merger or as to the
market price of Peregrine's common stock after the merger. The exchange ratio
for the stock portion of the merger consideration and the cash payable per share
of Remedy common stock are each fixed and will not be adjusted to compensate
stockholders of Remedy for increases or decreases in the market price of
Peregrine's common stock, which could occur before the merger becomes effective.
In the event the market price of Peregrine's common stock decreases or increases
prior to the effective time of the merger, the market value of the Peregrine
common stock that Remedy's stockholders will receive in the merger in exchange
for their Remedy common stock would correspondingly decrease or increase. YOU
ARE URGED TO OBTAIN CURRENT MARKET QUOTATIONS FOR PEREGRINE'S COMMON STOCK AND
REMEDY'S COMMON STOCK.

    Following the merger, Remedy's common stock will no longer be listed on the
Nasdaq National Market.

STOCKHOLDERS

DIVIDENDS

    Neither Peregrine nor Remedy has ever declared or paid cash dividends on its
capital stock. Peregrine currently expects to retain future earnings, if any,
for use in the operation and expansion of its business and does not anticipate
paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future. Under the merger agreement,
Remedy has agreed not to pay cash dividends pending the consummation of the
merger.

                           THE REMEDY SPECIAL MEETING

    This proxy statement/prospectus is being furnished to you in connection with
the solicitation of proxies by Remedy's board of directors for use at a special
meeting of the stockholders of Remedy at which Remedy's stockholders will vote
upon matters in connection with the proposed merger. On June 10, 2001,
Peregrine, Remedy, and a wholly owned subsidiary of Peregrine entered into an
Agreement and Plan of Merger and Reorganization. The merger agreement
contemplates a merger of Remedy into a subsidiary of Peregrine, as a result of
which the corporate existence of Remedy would cease and stockholders of Remedy
would become stockholders of Peregrine.

DATE, TIME AND PLACE OF THE SPECIAL MEETING

    The special meeting of stockholders will be held on August 27, 2001 at
9:00 a.m., local time, at Remedy's headquarters located at 1585 Charleston Road,
Mountain View, California 94043.

PURPOSE OF THE REMEDY SPECIAL MEETING

    The purpose of Remedy's special meeting is for holders of Remedy common
stock to consider and to vote upon the approval and adoption of the Agreement
and Plan of Merger and Reorganization entered on June 10, 2001 among Remedy,
Peregrine, and a wholly owned subsidiary of Peregrine and upon the approval of
the merger contemplated by the merger agreement. In addition, stockholders of
Remedy may transact any other business that may properly come before the Remedy
special meeting or any adjournment or postponement of the special meeting.
Examples of other business that could be transacted at the meeting would be a
motion to adjourn to a later date to permit further solicitation of proxies, if
necessary, or to establish a quorum.

RECOMMENDATION OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS

    The board of directors of Remedy has unanimously determined that the merger
agreement and the merger are fair to, and in the best interests of, Remedy and
its stockholders. REMEDY'S BOARD OF DIRECTORS, THEREFORE, UNANIMOUSLY RECOMMENDS
THAT STOCKHOLDERS OF REMEDY VOTE FOR THE PROPOSAL TO ADOPT AND APPROVE THE
MERGER AGREEMENT AND APPROVE THE MERGER.

RECORD DATE AND OUTSTANDING SHARES

    Stockholders of record who owned Remedy common stock at the close of
business on July 9, 2001 will be entitled to attend and vote at Remedy's special
meeting. On the record date, Remedy had approximately 30,909,043 shares of
common stock issued and outstanding. Remedy had 142 stockholders of record on
the record date and believes that its common stock is held by more than 7,000
beneficial owners.

VOTE AND QUORUM REQUIRED

    In order to conduct business at Remedy's special meeting, a quorum must be
present. A quorum will be present if a majority of the outstanding shares as of
the record date are present at the special meeting in person or by proxy.

    Holders of Remedy's common stock are entitled to one vote for each share
held as of the record date. In order for the merger to become effective, holders
of at least a majority of Remedy's outstanding common stock at the record date
must approve the merger agreement and the merger. Holders of approximately 10.4%
of the outstanding shares of Remedy's common stock as of the record date have
entered agreements under which they agreed to vote for the merger agreement and
the merger and to be present, in person or by proxy, at the special meeting.

TREATMENT OF ABSTENTIONS AND BROKER NON-VOTES

    If you submit a proxy that indicates an abstention for voting in all
matters, your shares will be counted as present for the purpose of determining a
quorum, but they will not be voted on any matter at the applicable special
meeting. Consequently, your abstention will have the same effect as a vote
against the proposal.

    Under the rules that govern brokers who have record ownership of shares that
are held in "street name" for their clients, the actual beneficial owners of the
shares, brokers have discretion to vote these shares on routine matters but not
on non-routine matters. The approval of the merger and the merger agreement at
the Remedy special meeting is not considered a routine matter. Accordingly,
brokers will not have discretionary voting authority to vote your shares. A
"broker non-vote" occurs when brokers do not have discretionary voting authority
and have not received instructions from the beneficial owners of the shares. At
the special meeting, broker non-votes will be counted for the purpose of
determining the presence of a quorum but will not be counted for the purpose of
determining the number of votes cast on a matter. At Remedy's special meeting,
broker non-votes will have the same effect as a vote against the proposal to
adopt and approve the merger agreement and to approve the merger. Accordingly,
Remedy stockholders are urged to vote their shares by returning the enclosed
proxy.

EXPENSES OF PROXY SOLICITATION

    Remedy will bear the expenses of proxy solicitation, and Peregrine and
Remedy will share the cost of preparing and mailing this proxy
statement/prospectus. Remedy has retained Georgeson Shareholder Communications,
Inc. to assist with the solicitation of proxies for a fee of approximately
$6,000 plus reimbursement of the reasonable expenses Georgesen incurs. In
addition, Remedy may reimburse brokerage firms and other custodians for their
reasonable out-of-pocket expenses for forwarding this proxy statement/prospectus
to Remedy's stockholders.

    Proxies may be solicited by directors, officers, and employees of Remedy in
person or by telephone, facsimile, or other means of communication. These
directors, officers, and employees will not receive additional compensation for
their solicitation efforts but may be reimbursed for their reasonable
out-of-pocket expenses.

                                   THE MERGER

    THIS SECTION OF THE PROXY STATEMENT/PROSPECTUS CONTAINS A DESCRIPTION OF
ASPECTS OF THE MERGER. THIS SUMMARY MAY NOT CONTAIN ALL OF THE INFORMATION THAT
IS IMPORTANT TO YOU. FOR A MORE COMPLETE UNDERSTANDING OF THE MERGER, YOU SHOULD
CAREFULLY READ THIS ENTIRE DOCUMENT AND THE OTHER DOCUMENTS REFERRED TO IN THIS
PROXY STATEMENT/PROSPECTUS.

BACKGROUND OF THE MERGER

    Peregrine is a leading global provider of infrastructure resource management
applications, employee relationship management (or self-service) solutions and
e-commerce technologies and services. These products, services, and enabling
technologies permit businesses to eliminate points of friction in the cost of
doing business.

    Remedy is a leading provider of information technology service management
and customer relationship management solutions. Remedy's products provide a
highly adaptable foundation for companies that require infrastructure support
for management of corporate assets, service-intensive business processes, and
customer acquisition and retention. Because Remedy's solutions can be readily
deployed at low cost and adapted to changing business requirements without
costly programming, Remedy has been particularly successful in selling its
products to small and medium-sized businesses.

    In the latter part of 1999, Stephen P. Gardner, Peregrine's president and
chief executive officer, and Lawrence L. Garlick, the chairman of Remedy's board
of directors and Remedy's chief executive officer, first exchanged telephone
calls to discuss the possibility of a strategic relationship between the two
companies. In December 1999, Mr. Gardner met with Mr. Garlick, Ron J. Fior,
Remedy's vice president of finance and operations and chief financial officer,
and other representatives of Remedy to continue the general discussion of this
topic. The meeting did not result in any conclusions with respect to a strategic
relationship or result in any resolutions to take any for future steps toward a
strategic relationship.

    In the fall of 2000, Remedy sought the advice of Morgan Stanley regarding
strategic alternatives. In October and November of that year, Morgan Stanley met
with management and the board of directors to assess Remedy's strategic
alternatives and discuss possible partners, including Peregrine. Over the next
several months, Morgan Stanley, on behalf of Remedy, had informal conversations
with Peregrine and other potential partners to discuss possible transactions.

    In January 2001, Peregrine retained Banc of America Securities LLC to act as
its financial advisor in evaluating the potential benefits of a strategic
relationship with Remedy and entered into an engagement letter with Banc of
America Securities LLC dated as of January 24, 2001.

    In February 2001, representatives of Banc of America Securities LLC, on
behalf of Peregrine, contacted representatives of Morgan Stanley by telephone to
convey Peregrine's interest in renewing discussions of a strategic transaction.
In the discussion, the parties discussed the strategic benefits to both
companies that might be realized through a business combination.

    In early April 2001, Peregrine's financial advisors again contacted Remedy's
financial advisors to discuss a proposed meeting between Mr. Gardner and
Mr. Garlick. Following this discussion, the two executives met in San Diego on
April 9, 2001 to consider again at a high level the possible benefits and
synergies that might be realized through a combination of the two companies. The
meeting concluded without any determination as to whether a combination might
proceed.

    Throughout April and May 2001, with authorization from Remedy's board of
directors, Morgan Stanley contacted a short list of other potential partners to
explore alternatives and assess the interest level of other companies in a
possible strategic transaction with Remedy.

    On April 30, 2001, following the public release of financial results by the
two companies, Mr. Gardner contacted Mr. Garlick to outline a proposal pursuant
to which Peregrine would be willing to acquire Remedy's stock. In the proposal,
Peregrine expressed its willingness to acquire all of the outstanding shares of
Remedy at a per share price equal to $4.00 in cash and 0.8631 of a share of
Peregrine common stock. On that same day and continuing through the first part
of May 2001, the financial advisors of the two companies conferred by telephone
and in person to discuss the business and operations of the two companies and
elements of valuation underlying Peregrine's proposal, based on public
disclosures by both companies. At the conclusion of these discussions, Remedy's
board of directors authorized Morgan Stanley to inform Peregrine that Remedy was
not interested in pursuing a transaction on Peregrine's proposed terms.

    On May 9, May 10, May 11, May 15 and May 22, 2001, Peregrine executed a
series of open market purchases of Remedy's common stock through Banc of America
Securities LLC. These transactions resulted in the purchase of 295,000 shares of
Remedy's common stock for an aggregate purchase price of $5,744,701. These
purchases were made without consultation with Remedy or its advisors. At the
time of these purchases, neither Peregrine nor any of its representatives were
aware of any material, non-public information regarding Remedy.

    On May 14, 2001, at the instruction of Peregrine's board of directors,
Mr. Gardner contacted Mr. Garlick to present another proposal. In this proposal,
Peregrine indicated it would be willing to acquire all of the outstanding shares
of Remedy at a per share price equal to 1.1882 shares of Peregrine common stock.
This proposal represented an increase in value from Peregrine's previous
proposal.

    Following Mr. Gardner's communication of Peregrine's revised proposal to
Mr. Garlick, Peregrine's financial advisors contacted Remedy's financial
advisors that same day by conference telephone to explain Peregrine's views
supporting the proposal.

    On May 15, 2001, Remedy's board of directors met to review and discuss
Peregrine's most recent proposed terms for the transaction. Remedy's legal
advisors were present at this meeting. After evaluating Peregrine's proposal,
Remedy's board of directors decided to reject the proposal.

    On May 21, 2001, Morgan Stanley contacted Peregrine's financial advisors to
discuss Remedy's concerns with the financial terms of Peregrine's most recent
proposal.

    On May 22, 2001, the financial advisors of the two companies again conferred
by conference telephone to consider valuation matters.

    On May 23, 2001, Remedy and Morgan Stanley executed an engagement letter
outlining the financial terms of Remedy's agreement with Morgan Stanley to act
as Remedy's financial advisor for the merger.

    On May 24, 2001, at the instruction of Peregrine's board of directors,
Mr. Gardner presented a best and final proposal to Mr. Garlick. In this
proposal, Peregrine offered to acquire all of the outstanding shares of Remedy
for a per share price of $9.00 in cash and 0.9065 of a share of Peregrine common
stock. This revised proposal represented a further increase in value from the
proposal made by Mr. Gardner on May 14, 2001. Mr. Garlick agreed that Remedy's
board of directors would consider and respond to Peregrine's proposal not later
than May 31, 2001.

    On May 30, 2001, Remedy's board of directors met with its legal and
financial advisors to consider Peregrine's latest proposal. After reviewing
Peregrine's offer of a combination of cash and stock consideration, Remedy's
board of directors authorized Remedy's management and its legal and financial
advisors to continue discussions with Peregrine toward the negotiation of a
definitive merger agreement upon the financial terms proposed. Shortly following
the conclusion of Remedy's board of directors meeting, Mr. Garlick telephoned
Mr. Gardner to accept Peregrine's proposal, subject to

appropriate due diligence of both companies by their respective financial and
legal advisors and the management teams of the two companies.

    Also on May 30, 2001 and continuing into the first week of June 2001,
Richard T. Nelson, a Peregrine senior vice president, Matthew C. Gless,
Peregrine's executive vice president, finance and chief financial officer, and
Mr. Fior, together with the financial and legal advisors of the two companies,
spoke by conference telephone on numerous occasions to address due diligence
logistics, a due diligence timetable and other matters relevant to the Peregrine
proposal.

    On June 4, 2001, Peregrine and Remedy entered into a confidentiality
agreement and both companies began their due diligence investigations.

    Beginning June 4 and continuing through June 10, 2001, a number of managers
and other employee representatives of Peregrine met with their counterparts from
Remedy as part of the due diligence process. Peregrine's and Remedy's legal and
financial advisors assisted Peregrine and Remedy with respect to due diligence.

    On Friday, June 8, 2001, the board of directors of Peregrine held a special
telephonic board of directors meeting at which the terms and other matters
relating to the proposed merger were reviewed. Peregrine's legal and financial
advisors were in attendance at the meeting. Remedy's board of directors also
held a meeting on June 8, 2001 to review the status of negotiations and due
diligence for the proposed transaction. Remedy's legal and financial advisors
were present at this meeting.

    On June 10, 2001, the board of directors of Peregrine held a special
telephonic board of directors meeting at which the status and the terms of the
proposed merger were reviewed. At this meeting, Peregrine's board of directors
approved the merger and authorized the execution and delivery of the merger
agreement and the ancillary transaction agreements.

    Remedy's board of directors also held a meeting on June 10, 2001 at which
the status and the terms of the proposed merger were reviewed and Morgan Stanley
presented its opinion as to the fairness of the financial terms of the merger to
the holders of common stock of Remedy. Remedy's legal advisors also were present
at this meeting. Remedy's board of directors then adopted a resolution approving
the merger agreement and declaring its advisability and approving the merger.

    On June 10, 2001, Peregrine and Remedy finalized, executed and delivered the
merger agreement and the ancillary transaction agreements.

    On June 11, 2001, the companies issued a joint press release announcing the
transaction.

PEREGRINE'S REASONS FOR THE MERGER

    In its decision to approve the merger, the most important benefits
identified by the board of directors of Peregrine included the following:

    - Peregrine's board of directors' judgment that the merger will result in a
      complementary coupling of Peregrine's infrastructure management,
      e-procurement and employee relationship management solutions with Remedy's
      business process authoring technology and information technology service
      management products;

    - Peregrine's board of directors' judgment that Remedy's customer focus on
      small to medium-sized business would complement, and be synergistic with,
      Peregrine's focus on larger enterprise customers for sales of its
      infrastructure management products;

    - the combination of the technical and marketing resources of the two
      companies is expected to lead to a broader product family that will be
      attractive to customers because it will represent an integrated solution
      for managing the acquisition, use, maintenance, and disposal of
      infrastructure assets; and

    - the combination of the companies' product lines, sales forces, and
      distribution channels is expected to enhance Peregrine's ability to sell
      its infrastructure management, e-procurement, and employee relationship
      management software products.

    Peregrine's board of directors consulted with senior management and outside
legal and financial advisors as part of the process of approving the merger. In
its evaluation, the Peregrine's board of directors considered several factors,
including the following:

    - the potential strategic benefits of the merger;

    - historical information concerning Peregrine's and Remedy's respective
      businesses, prospects, financial performance and condition, operations,
      technology and management, including public reports of the results of
      operations for each company as filed with the SEC;

    - the view of Peregrine's management of the financial condition, results of
      operations, and businesses of Peregrine and Remedy both before and after
      the merger;

    - current financial market conditions and historical market prices,
      volatility, and trading information with respect to Peregrine's common
      stock and Remedy's common stock;

    - the implied exchange ratio for the merger and the cash consideration to be
      paid in the merger in light of comparable transactions;

    - detailed financial analysis and pro forma and other information presented
      to the board;

    - the anticipated impact of the merger on Peregrine's customers and
      employees;

    - reports from Peregrine's management and its legal and financial advisors
      concerning their due diligence investigations of Remedy; and

    - the terms and conditions of the merger agreement and the ancillary
      transaction agreements.

    Peregrine's board of directors also identified and considered a number of
potentially negative factors in its deliberations concerning the merger,
including the following:

    - the risk that the potential benefits of the merger may not be realized;

    - Remedy's slower revenue growth rates relative to Peregrine's revenue
      growth rates;

    - the challenges of integrating the management teams, cultures, and
      organizations of the two companies;

    - the risk of disruption of Peregrine's and Remedy's on-going businesses,
      including sales momentum, as a result of uncertainties created by the
      announcement of the merger;

    - the risk that the merger might not be consummated despite the efforts of
      the parties, even if approved by Remedy's stockholders;

    - the substantial charges to be incurred in connection with the merger,
      including the costs of integrating the businesses and transaction expenses
      arising from the merger;

    - the risk that, despite the efforts of the combined company, key technical
      and management personnel might not remain employed by the combined
      company; and

    - the other factors described in the section of this proxy
      statement/prospectus entitled "Risk Factors" beginning on page 13.

    The foregoing discussion of the information and factors considered by
Peregrine's board of directors is not intended to be exhaustive but includes
material factors Peregrine's board of directors considered. In view of the
complexity of the transaction and the factors, both positive and negative,
influencing its decision, Peregrine's board of directors did not find it
practical to quantify, rank, or otherwise assign relative or specific weights to
these factors. In considering the factors described above, individual members of
Peregrine's board of directors may have given different weights to different
factors. Peregrine's board of directors considered all these factors as a whole
and believed the factors supported its determination to approve the merger.

REMEDY'S REASONS FOR THE MERGER

    In approving the merger agreement and the merger and recommending that
Remedy stockholders approve and adopt the merger agreement and approve the
merger, Remedy's board of directors identified a number of potential benefits
from the merger, including the following:

    - the Remedy board of directors' judgment that the two companies have
      significant complementary strengths and complementary products and
      solutions, including highly complementary technologies for evolving a
      solution development platform, compatible customer loyalty philosophies
      and track records, and complementary partnerships with value-added
      resellers and system integrators;

    - the fact that the consideration to be received by the holders of
      outstanding shares of Remedy's common stock was at a significant premium
      over the relative prices of Remedy's common stock prevailing in the market
      at the time the merger agreement was executed;

    - the opportunity for Remedy's stockholders to participate in future growth
      of the combined company as stockholders of Peregrine; and

    - the opportunity to combine Remedy's ACTION REQUEST SYSTEM environment with
      Peregrine's GET-IT STUDIO technology and technology recently acquired
      through Peregrine's acquisition of Extricity to offer an industry-leading,
      flexible application development environment.

    Remedy's board of directors consulted with senior management and its outside
legal and financial advisors as part of the process of approving the merger. In
its evaluation, Remedy's board of directors considered several factors,
including the following:

    - the potential strategic benefits of the merger;

    - the terms and conditions of the merger agreement and the ancillary
      transaction agreements;

    - historical information concerning Peregrine's and Remedy's respective
      businesses, prospects, financial performance and condition, operations,
      technology, management and future prospects;

    - Remedy management's perception of the strengths and weaknesses of
      Peregrine and Remedy, individually and as a combined company, including
      strengths and weaknesses in the two companies' technologies, sales forces,
      distribution channels, customer relationships, revenue base, management,
      brand awareness and areas of experience;

    - the premium represented by the implied exchange ratio and the premiums
      paid in other recent transactions that could be viewed as comparable;

    - the market value of Peregrine common stock and various factors that might
      affect that value in the future;

    - Remedy's business, financial condition, current business strategy and
      future business prospects;

    - the presentations and views expressed by management of Remedy regarding
      among other things:

       - the financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, business
         and prospects of Remedy;

       - Remedy's prospects as a stand-alone company, the uncertainties facing
         Remedy, and the outlook for its current strategies;

       - the prospects for achieving maximum long-term value on a stand-alone
         basis;

       - the strategic alternatives available to Remedy; and

       - the history of contacts with other potential strategic partners and the
         judgment of Remedy's board and management that it was unlikely that any
         other party would be a more attractive strategic partner or make a
         proposal more favorable to Remedy and its stockholders than Peregrine;

    - detailed financial analysis and pro forma and other information presented
      to the board, including the opinion of Morgan Stanley to the effect that,
      as of the date of its opinion and based on and subject to the
      considerations and assumptions described in the opinion, the consideration
      to be received by the holders of shares of common stock of Remedy pursuant
      to the merger agreement was fair, from a financial point of view, to such
      holders;

    - the anticipated impact of the merger on Remedy's customers and employees;
      and

    - reports from Remedy's management and its legal and financial advisors
      concerning their due diligence investigations of Peregrine.

    Remedy's board of directors also identified and considered a number of risks
and uncertainties in its deliberations concerning the merger, including the
following:

    - the fact that the exchange ratio portion of the offer is fixed and will
      not change with increases or decreases in the market price of either
      company's stock before the effectiveness of the merger;

    - the possibility that, in light of the fixed exchange ratio portion of the
      offer, the value to be received by Remedy's stockholders in the merger
      could be substantially reduced in the event of a decline in Peregrine's
      stock price;

    - the risk that the potential benefits of the merger may not be realized;

    - the risk that the merger might not be consummated despite the efforts of
      the parties, even if approved by stockholders;

    - the risk that the voting agreements executed by executive officers and
      directors of Remedy would reduce the likelihood of a third party bid for
      Remedy;

    - Remedy's limited rights under the merger agreement to consider or pursue
      superior acquisition proposals;

    - the risk of disruption of Remedy's on-going business, including sales
      momentum, as a result of uncertainties created by the announcement of the
      merger;

    - the risk that, despite the efforts of the combined company, key technical
      and management personnel might not remain employed by the combined
      company;

    - the risk of confusion and hesitation and potential cancellation, delay or
      reduction in product and service orders by Remedy's customers;

    - the fact that pursuant to the merger agreement, Remedy is required to
      obtain Peregrine's consent before it can take a variety of actions outside
      of the ordinary course of business between the signing of the merger
      agreement and the closing of the merger; and

    - the other factors described in the section of this proxy
      statement/prospectus entitled "Risk Factors" beginning on page 13.

    The foregoing discussion of the information and factors considered by
Remedy's board of directors is not intended to be exhaustive, but includes
material factors Remedy's board of directors considered. In view of the
complexity of the transaction and the factors, both positive and negative,
influencing its decision, Remedy's board of directors did not find it practical
to quantify, rank, or otherwise assign relative or specific weights to these
factors. In considering the factors described above, individual members of
Remedy's board of directors may have given different weights to different
factors. Remedy's board of directors considered all these factors as a whole and
believed the factors supported its determination to approve the merger.

RECOMMENDATION OF REMEDY'S BOARD OF DIRECTORS

    AFTER CAREFUL CONSIDERATION THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS OF REMEDY UNANIMOUSLY
RECOMMENDS THAT REMEDY'S STOCKHOLDERS VOTE IN FAVOR OF THE APPROVAL AND ADOPTION
OF THE MERGER AGREEMENT AND IN FAVOR OF APPROVAL OF THE MERGER.

    In considering the recommendation of Remedy's board of directors, you should
be aware that some directors and officers of Remedy have interests in the merger
that are different from, or are in addition to, the interests of Remedy
stockholders generally. Please see the section entitled "Interests of Remedy's
directors and executive officers" on page 65 of this proxy statement/prospectus.

OPINION OF REMEDY'S FINANCIAL ADVISOR

    Under an engagement letter dated May 23, 2001, Remedy retained Morgan
Stanley to provide it with financial advisory services and a fairness opinion
with respect to certain financial terms of the proposed merger. Remedy's board
of directors selected Morgan Stanley to act as its financial advisor based on
Morgan Stanley's qualifications, expertise and reputation and its knowledge of
the business and affairs of Remedy. At the telephonic meeting of the Remedy
board of directors on June 10, 2001, Morgan Stanley rendered its oral opinion,
subsequently confirmed in writing, that as of June 10, 2001, based upon and
subject to the assumptions and considerations set forth in its opinion, the
consideration to be received by the holders of shares of common stock of Remedy
pursuant to the merger agreement was fair from a financial point of view to such
holders.

    The full text of Morgan Stanley's opinion, dated as of June 10, 2001, is
attached as Annex D hereto. The opinion sets forth, among other things, the
assumptions made, procedures followed, matters considered and limitations on the
scope of the review undertaken by Morgan Stanley in rendering its opinion. You
are urged to read the entire opinion carefully. Morgan Stanley's opinion is
directed to Remedy's board of directors and addresses only the fairness from a
financial point of view of the consideration to be received by the holders of
shares of common stock of Remedy pursuant to the merger agreement as of the date
of the opinion. The opinion does not address any other aspects of the merger and
does not constitute a recommendation to any holder of Remedy common stock as to
how to vote at the Remedy special meeting. The summary of the opinion of Morgan
Stanley set forth in this document is qualified in its entirety by reference to
the full text of the opinion.

    In connection with rendering its opinion, Morgan Stanley, among other
things:

    - reviewed certain publicly available financial statements and other
      business and financial information of Remedy and Peregrine, respectively;

    - reviewed certain historical financial and other operating data concerning
      Peregrine prepared by the management of Peregrine;

    - reviewed certain historical internal financial statements and other
      historical financial and operating data concerning Remedy prepared by the
      management of Remedy;

      anticipated from the merger with the management of Remedy and reviewed
      estimates of the financial benefits including cost savings anticipated
      from the merger prepared by the management of Remedy;

    - discussed certain strategic, financial and operational benefits
      anticipated from the merger with the management of Peregrine;

      and Peregrine common stock;

    - compared the financial performance of Remedy and Peregrine and the prices
      and trading activity of the Remedy common stock and Peregrine common stock
      with that of certain other comparable publicly-traded companies and their
      securities;

    - reviewed the financial terms, to the extent publicly available, of certain
      comparable acquisition transactions;

    - discussed with the management of Remedy their strategic rationale for the
      merger and certain alternatives to the merger;

    - participated in discussions and negotiations among representatives of
      Remedy, Peregrine and their financial and legal advisors;

    - reviewed a draft of the merger agreement and certain related documents;
      and

    - performed such other analyses and considered such other factors as Morgan
      Stanley deemed appropriate.

    Morgan Stanley assumed and relied upon, without independent verification,
the accuracy and completeness of the information reviewed by it for the purposes
of its opinion. With respect to the estimates relating to the financial and
operational benefits anticipated from the merger, Morgan Stanley assumed that
they were reasonably prepared on bases reflecting the best currently available
estimates and judgments of the future financial performance of Remedy and
Peregrine, respectively. In addition, Morgan Stanley assumed that the merger
would be consummated in accordance with the terms set forth in the merger
agreement.

    Morgan Stanley relied upon, without independent verification, the assessment
by the management of Remedy and Peregrine of: (i) the strategic, financial and
other benefits expected to result from the merger; (ii) the timing and risks
associated with the integration of Remedy and Peregrine; and (iii) the validity
of, and risks associated with, Remedy's and Peregrine's existing and future
technologies, intellectual property, products, services and business models.
Morgan Stanley has not made any independent valuation or appraisal of the
assets, liabilities or technology of Remedy and Peregrine, nor were they
furnished with any such appraisals. Morgan Stanley's opinion is necessarily
based on financial, economic, market and other conditions as in effect on, and
the information made available to Morgan Stanley as of, June 10, 2001.

    The following is a brief summary of the material financial analyses
performed by Morgan Stanley in connection with the rendering of its oral opinion
and the preparation of its written opinion. Some of these summaries of financial
analyses include information presented in tabular format. In order to fully
understand the financial analyses used by Morgan Stanley, the tables must be
read together with the text of each summary. The tables alone do not constitute
a complete description of the financial analyses.

    REMEDY

    TRADING RANGE.  Morgan Stanley reviewed the range of closing prices of
Remedy common stock for various periods ended on June 8, 2001, the last trading
day prior to the announcement of the merger. Morgan Stanley observed the
following:

PERIOD ENDING JUNE 8, 2001                                RANGE OF CLOSING PRICES
- --------------------------                                -----------------------

52 weeks................................................    $15.00 - $55.75
From July 26, 2000......................................    $15.00 - $26.94
60 trading days.........................................    $15.05 - $20.81
From April 6, 2001......................................    $15.05 - $20.00
30 trading days.........................................    $16.92 - $20.00

    The implied transaction value of $35.12 per share of Remedy common stock is
based on Peregrine's common stock price of $28.81 per share as of June 8, 2001.
Morgan Stanley noted that the implied transaction value reflected a 91.5%
premium to Remedy's closing price as of June 8, 2001 and was above the range of
closing prices for the 30-day and 60-day periods ending on June 8, 2001 as well
as above the range of closing prices for the 220 trading-day period since
Remedy's second quarter 2000 earnings announcement on July 25, 2000 and the 44
trading-day period since Remedy's first quarter 2001 earnings pre-announcement
on April 6, 2001.

    COMPARABLE COMPANY TRADING ANALYSIS INCLUDING CHANGE OF CONTROL
PREMIUM.  Morgan Stanley compared certain publicly available financial
information of Remedy with publicly available information for selected companies
comparable to the business or businesses of Remedy. The following table lists
the relevant comparable companies analyzed by Morgan Stanley:

                                     REMEDY
                              COMPARABLE COMPANIES
                              --------------------

                             Compuware Corporation
                         Hyperion Solutions Corporation
                             J.D. Edwards & Company
                              Sybase, Incorporated
                              Symantec Corporation

    In conducting its analysis, Morgan Stanley applied the relevant financial
multiples of the comparable companies to publicly available securities research
analyst estimates of various financial statistics for Remedy and added a change
of control premium ranging from 20% to 40%. Morgan Stanley then estimated the
implied value per share of Remedy as of June 8, 2001. Morgan Stanley estimated
the following:

                                         REMEDY       COMPARABLE
                                        FINANCIAL      COMPANY       IMPLIED VALUE PER

  Estimate ("PEG" Ratio)..............    0.51x       0.7x - 1.0x    $30.24 - $50.40

    Morgan Stanley noted that the implied transaction value of $35.12 per share
of Remedy common stock was within or above the implied share value range for
each of the multiples shown above.

    No company utilized in the comparable company analysis is identical to
Remedy. In evaluating the comparable companies, Morgan Stanley made judgments
and assumptions with regard to industry performance, general business, economic,
market and financial conditions and other matters, many of which are beyond the
control of Remedy, such as the impact of competition on the businesses of Remedy
and the industry in general, industry growth and the absence of any material
adverse change in the financial condition and prospects of Remedy or the
industry or in the financial markets in general. Mathematical analysis, such as
determining the average or median, is not in itself a meaningful method of using
comparable company data.

    EXCHANGE RATIO PREMIUM ANALYSIS.  Morgan Stanley reviewed the ratios of the
closing prices of Remedy common stock divided by the corresponding closing
prices of Peregrine common stock over various periods ending on June 8, 2001.
These ratios are referred to as period average exchange ratios. Morgan Stanley
calculated the implied exchange ratio set forth in the merger agreement on
June 8, 2001 by converting the $9.00 per share cash portion of the offer into
Peregrine common stock based on the June 8, 2001 closing price of Peregrine
common stock and adding this amount to the per share stock portion of the offer.
The implied exchange ratio based on the closing prices of Remedy common stock
and Peregrine common stock on June 8, 2001 was 1.2189. Morgan Stanley examined
the premiums represented by the implied exchange ratio set forth in the merger
agreement over these period average exchange ratios, and found them to be as
follows:

                                                                     TRANSACTION

    Morgan Stanley noted that the implied transaction exchange ratio of 1.2189
was higher than the average exchange ratio of the closing prices for all
periods.

    ANALYSIS OF SELECTED PRECEDENT TRANSACTIONS.  Morgan Stanley compared
publicly available information for selected transactions in the enterprise
software sector to the relevant financial statistics for Remedy. The following
is a list of the selected precedent transactions reviewed:

               SELECTED PRECEDENT TRANSACTIONS (TARGET/ACQUIROR)
          ------------------------------------------------------------

          Sterling Software, Inc./Computer Associates International,
          Inc.
          Sterling Commerce, Inc./SBC Communications, Inc.
          PLATINUM Technology International, Inc./Computer Associates

          Boole & Babbage, Inc./BMC Software, Inc.
          Great Plains Software, Inc./Microsoft Corporation
          Saville Systems PLC/ADC Telecommunications, Inc.

    For each precedent transaction, Morgan Stanley analyzed, as of the
announcement date of each transaction, the multiple implied by the transaction
value of the: (i) price to Remedy's last twelve months cash earnings,
(ii) price to Remedy's next twelve months estimated cash earnings,
(iii) aggregate value to Remedy's last twelve months revenues, and
(iv) aggregate value to Remedy's next twelve months estimated revenues.
Additionally, Morgan Stanley analyzed the premiums to the 1-day exchange ratio,
30-day average exchange ratio, 60-day average exchange ratio and 90-day average
exchange ratio, prior to the announcement of each precedent transaction. Morgan
Stanley observed the following:

Premium to the 90-day average exchange ratio...    12% - 139%            46.3%

    No company or transaction utilized in the analysis of selected precedent
transactions is identical to Remedy or Peregrine or the merger. In evaluating
the precedent transactions, Morgan Stanley made judgments and assumptions with
regard to industry performance, general business, market and financial
conditions and other matters, which are beyond the control of Remedy and
Peregrine, such as the impact of competition on the business of Remedy,
Peregrine, or the industry generally, industry growth and the absence of any
adverse material change in the financial condition and prospects of Remedy,
Peregrine or the industry or in the financial markets in general, which could
affect the public trading value of the companies and the aggregate value of the
transactions to which they are being compared.

    DISCOUNTED EQUITY VALUE.  Morgan Stanley performed an analysis of the
implied present value per share of Remedy common stock on a stand-alone basis
based on Remedy's projected future equity value using equity research analyst
projections that were publicly available as of June 8, 2001 for Remedy's future
cash earnings projections.

                                                                 NEXT

2004 Estimated Cash Earnings Per Share.........    $2.03       15x - 25x       15.0%    $23.00 - $38.34

    Morgan Stanley observed that the implied transaction value of $35.12 per
share of Remedy common stock was at the high end of the estimated reference
range.

    RELATIVE CONTRIBUTION ANALYSIS.  Morgan Stanley compared Remedy and
Peregrine stockholders' respective percentage ownership of the combined company
to Remedy's and Peregrine's respective percentage contribution (and the implied
ownership based on such contribution) to the combined

company using revenues, operating income and net income based on
publicly-available equity research analyst estimates.

  Calendar Year 2002 Estimated........................         21.5           78.5

    Morgan Stanley calculated the implied exchange ratio set forth in the merger
agreement on June 8, 2001 by converting the $9.00 per share cash portion of the
offer into Peregrine common stock based on the June 8, 2001 closing price of
Peregrine common stock and adding this amount to the per share stock portion of
the offer. The implied exchange ratio based on the closing prices of Remedy
common stock and Peregrine common stock on June 8, 2001 was 1.2189.

    Morgan Stanley noted that the implied pro forma Remedy ownership of the
combined company was 19.4% using the implied exchange ratio of 1.2189. Based on
the analyses, Morgan Stanley calculated a reference range of $23.28 - $66.08 per
share of Remedy common stock. Morgan Stanley observed that the implied
transaction value of $35.12 per share of Remedy common stock was within the
reference range based on this analysis.

    ACCRETION/DILUTION ANALYSIS:  Morgan Stanley analyzed the pro forma impact
of the merger on Peregrine's combined projected cash earnings per share for the
year ending December 31, 2002. In performing this analysis, Morgan Stanley
utilized publicly available research analyst estimates for revenues and cash
earnings.

    Morgan Stanley's analysis indicated that, exclusive of the impact of
potential synergies, the merger would result in earnings per share accretion of
2.1% for the year ending December 31, 2002. Inclusive of the impact of potential
synergies, the earnings per share accretion would be in excess of 2.1% for the
year ending December 31, 2002.

    PEREGRINE

    TRADING RANGE.  Morgan Stanley reviewed the range of closing prices of
Peregrine common stock prior to June 8, 2001. Morgan Stanley observed the

    In conducting its analysis, Morgan Stanley applied the relevant financial
multiples of the comparable companies to publicly available securities research
analyst estimates of various financial statistics for Peregrine. Morgan Stanley
then estimated the implied value per share of Peregrine as of June 8, 2001.
Morgan Stanley estimated the following:

    No company utilized in the comparable company analysis is identical to
Peregrine. In evaluating the comparable companies, Morgan Stanley made judgments
and assumptions with regard to industry performance, general business, economic,
market and financial conditions and other matters, many of which are beyond the
control of Peregrine, such as the impact of competition on the businesses of
Peregrine and the industry in general, industry growth and the absence of any
material adverse change in the financial condition and prospects of Peregrine or
the industry or in the financial markets in general. Mathematical analysis, such
as determining the average or median, is not in itself a meaningful method of
using comparable company data.

    DISCOUNTED EQUITY VALUE.  Morgan Stanley performed an analysis of the
implied present value per share of Peregrine common stock on a stand-alone basis
based on Peregrine's projected future equity

value using equity research analyst projections that were publicly-available as
of June 8, 2001 for Peregrine's future cash earnings projections.

    Morgan Stanley observed the price per share of Peregrine common stock on
June 8, 2001 of $28.81 was at the low end of the estimated reference range of
$26.20 - $55.35.

    In connection with the review of the merger by Remedy's board of directors,
Morgan Stanley performed a variety of financial and comparative analyses for
purposes of rendering its opinion. The preparation of a fairness opinion is a
complex process and is not necessarily susceptible to a partial analysis or
summary description. In arriving at its opinion, Morgan Stanley considered the
results of all of its analyses as a whole and did not attribute any particular
weight to any analysis or factor it considered. Morgan Stanley believes that
selecting any portion of its analyses, without considering all analyses as a
whole, would create an incomplete view of the process underlying its analyses
and opinion. In addition, Morgan Stanley may have given various analyses and
factors more or less weight than other analyses and factors, and may have deemed
various assumptions more or less probable than other assumptions. As a result,
the ranges of valuations resulting from any particular analysis described above
should not be taken to be Morgan Stanley's view of the actual value of Remedy or
Peregrine. In performing its analyses, Morgan Stanley made numerous assumptions
with respect to industry performance, general business and economic conditions
and other matters. Many of these assumptions are beyond the control of Remedy or
Peregrine. Any estimates contained in Morgan Stanley's analyses are not
necessarily indicative of future results or actual values, which may be
significantly more or less favorable than those suggested by such estimates.

    Morgan Stanley conducted the analyses described above solely as part of its
analysis of the fairness of the consideration to be received by holders of
Remedy common stock pursuant to the merger agreement from a financial point of
view and in connection with the delivery of its opinion dated June 10, 2001 to
Remedy's board of directors. These analyses do not purport to be appraisals or
to reflect the prices at which shares of common stock of Remedy or Peregrine
might actually trade.

    The consideration to be received by holders of Remedy common stock pursuant
to the merger agreement was determined through arm's length negotiations between
Remedy and Peregrine and was approved by Remedy's board of directors. Morgan
Stanley provided advice to Remedy during these negotiations. Morgan Stanley did
not, however, recommend any specific consideration to Remedy or its board of
directors or that any specific consideration constituted the only appropriate
consideration for the merger.

    In addition, Morgan Stanley's opinion and its presentation to Remedy's board
of directors was one of many factors taken into consideration by Remedy's board
of directors in deciding to approve the merger. Consequently, the analyses as
described above should not be viewed as determinative of the opinion of Remedy's
board of directors with respect to the consideration or of whether Remedy's
board of directors would have been willing to agree to a different
consideration.

    Remedy's board of directors retained Morgan Stanley based upon Morgan
Stanley's qualifications, experience and expertise. Morgan Stanley is an
internationally recognized investment banking and advisory firm. Morgan Stanley,
as part of its investment banking and financial advisory business, is
continuously engaged in the valuation of businesses and securities in connection
with mergers and acquisitions, negotiated underwritings, competitive biddings,
secondary distributions of listed and unlisted securities, private placements
and valuations for corporate, estate and other purposes. In the

past, Morgan Stanley and its affiliates have provided financial advisory
services for Peregrine, but did not receive fees for the rendering of these
services. In the ordinary course of Morgan Stanley's trading and brokerage
activities, Morgan Stanley or its affiliates may at any time hold long or short
positions, may trade or otherwise effect transactions, for its own account or
for the account of customers in the senior loans, equity and other securities of
Remedy, Peregrine or any other parties involved in the merger.

    Under the engagement letter, Morgan Stanley provided financial advisory
services and a financial fairness opinion in connection with the merger, and
Remedy agreed to pay Morgan Stanley a customary fee for its services. Remedy has
also agreed to reimburse Morgan Stanley for its reasonable travel and other
out-of-pocket expenses (including attorneys' fees). In addition, Remedy has
agreed to indemnify Morgan Stanley and its affiliates, their respective
directors, officers, agents and employees and each person, if any, controlling
Morgan Stanley or any of its affiliates against certain liabilities and
expenses, including certain liabilities under the federal securities laws,
related to or arising out of Morgan Stanley's engagement.

ACCOUNTING TREATMENT

    The merger will be accounted for as a "purchase" transaction for accounting
and financial reporting purposes, in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles. After the merger, the results of operations of Remedy
will be included in the consolidated financial statements of Peregrine. The
purchase price will be allocated based on the fair values of the assets acquired
and the liabilities assumed. Any excess of cost over fair value of the net
tangible assets of Remedy acquired will be recorded as goodwill and other
intangible assets. These allocations will be made based upon valuations and
other studies that have not yet been finalized.

MATERIAL UNITED STATES FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSEQUENCES OF THE MERGER

    In the opinion of Wilson Sonsini Goodrich & Rosati, P.C., counsel to
Peregrine, and Gunderson Dettmer Stough Villeneuve Franklin & Hachigian, LLP,
counsel to Remedy, the following are the material United States federal income
tax consequences of the merger, assuming that the merger is effected as
described in the merger agreement and this proxy statement/prospectus. This
opinion and the following discussion are based on currently existing provisions
of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, existing Treasury Regulations
thereunder and current administrative rulings and court decisions, all of which
are subject to change. Any such change, which may or may not be retroactive,
could alter the tax consequences to Peregrine, Remedy or Remedy's stockholders
as described herein. The Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, is referred
to as the "Code."

    This discussion does not address all U.S. federal income tax considerations
that may be relevant to particular Remedy stockholders in light of their
particular circumstances, such as banks, insurance companies, tax-exempt
organizations, dealers in securities, or foreign persons, or Remedy stockholders
who acquired their shares in connection with stock option or stock purchase
plans or in other compensatory transactions, who hold Remedy common stock as
part of an integrated investment, including a "straddle", comprised of shares of
Remedy common stock and one or more other positions, or who have previously
entered into a constructive sale of Remedy common stock. The discussion assumes
that Remedy's stockholders hold their shares of Remedy common stock as capital
assets (generally for investment). In addition, the following discussion does
not address the tax consequences of the merger under foreign, state or local tax
laws or the tax consequences of transactions effectuated prior or subsequent to
or concurrently with the merger, whether or not such transactions are in
connection with the merger, including, without limitation, transactions in which
Remedy common stock is acquired or Peregrine common stock is disposed of.

    ACCORDINGLY, REMEDY STOCKHOLDERS ARE URGED TO CONSULT THEIR OWN TAX ADVISORS
AS TO THE SPECIFIC TAX CONSEQUENCES OF THE MERGER, INCLUDING THE APPLICABLE
FEDERAL, STATE, LOCAL AND FOREIGN TAX CONSEQUENCES TO THEM OF THE MERGER IN
THEIR PARTICULAR CIRCUMSTANCES.

    Consummation of the merger is conditioned upon the receipt by Peregrine and
Remedy of tax opinions from their respective counsel that the merger will be
treated as a "reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code.
The tax opinions will be subject to certain assumptions, limitations and
qualifications, and are based upon the truth and accuracy of certain factual
representations of Peregrine, Rose Acquisition Corporation and Remedy.

    Provided that the merger qualifies as a reorganization, subject to the
assumptions, limitations and qualifications referred to herein:

    - Remedy stockholders receiving both Peregrine common stock and cash in
      exchange for Remedy common stock may recognize a gain, but only to the
      extent of the amount of cash received. Any such gain will be measured by
      the sum of the fair market value of the Peregrine common stock received
      plus the amount of cash received, minus the tax basis of the Remedy common
      stock exchanged therefor. Such gain should generally be capital gain,
      subject to the potential recharacterization as a dividend as discussed
      below, and should generally be long-term capital gain if the Remedy common
      stock exchanged in the merger has been held for more than one year. Remedy
      stockholders will not recognize any loss upon the receipt of Peregrine
      common stock and cash.

    - Cash payments received by Remedy stockholders in lieu of a fractional
      share of Peregrine common stock will be treated as if such fractional
      share had been issued in the merger and then redeemed by Peregrine. A
      Remedy stockholder receiving such cash will generally recognize capital
      gain or loss upon such payment, equal to the difference, if any, between
      such Remedy stockholder's tax basis in the fractional share and the amount
      of cash received.

    - The aggregate tax basis of the Peregrine common stock received by Remedy
      stockholders in the merger, including any fractional share of Peregrine
      common stock not actually received, will be the same as the aggregate tax
      basis of the Remedy common stock surrendered in exchange therefor,
      decreased by the tax basis allocated to fractional share interests for
      which cash is received in the merger and by the amount of cash
      consideration received in the merger (other than cash received for
      fractional share interests), and increased by the amount of gain (or
      dividend income) recognized on the exchange.

    - The holding period of the Peregrine common stock received in the merger
      will include the period for which the Remedy common stock surrendered in
      exchange therefor was held.

    - A Remedy stockholder who exercises appraisal rights with respect to Remedy
      common stock and receives payment for such stock in cash will generally
      recognize capital gain or loss measured by the difference between the
      Remedy stockholder's tax basis in such stock and the amount of cash
      received, provided that such payment is not treated as a dividend
      distribution for tax purposes. Such payment to a Remedy stockholder should
      not be treated as a dividend distribution if, after the payment, the
      Remedy stockholder owns no shares of Remedy or Peregrine stock, actually
      or constructively. If a Remedy stockholder's sale of Remedy common stock
      for cash pursuant to the exercise of appraisal rights is treated as a
      dividend, then such stockholder will generally recognize ordinary income
      on the amount of cash so received.

    - Neither Peregrine, Rose Acquisition Corporation nor Remedy will recognize
      gain solely as a result of the merger.

    As noted above, in certain circumstances, a Remedy stockholder that
exchanges Remedy common stock for Peregrine common stock and cash in the merger
will be required to treat any gain recognized as dividend income rather than
capital gain. In general, whether a stockholder must recognize capital gain or
dividend income is determined under Sections 356(a)(2) and 302 of the Code.
Under Section 356(a)(2) of the Code, each Remedy stockholder will be treated for
tax purposes as if such stockholder had received only Peregrine common stock in
the merger, and immediately thereafter Peregrine redeemed part of such stock in
exchange for the cash actually distributed to the stockholder in the merger.
Under Section 302 of the Code, the gain recognized by a Remedy stockholder on
the exchange will be taxed as capital gain if the deemed redemption from such
stockholder (i) is a "substantially disproportionate redemption" of stock with
respect to such stockholder, or (ii) is "not essentially equivalent to a
dividend" with respect to such stockholder. In making this determination, a
Remedy stockholder may be considered under Section 318 of the Code to own after
the merger Peregrine common stock owned, and in some cases constructively owned,
by certain individuals and entities related to such stockholder, as well as
Peregrine common stock that such stockholder, or such related individuals or
entities, has the right to acquire upon the exercise or conversion of options.

    The deemed redemption of a Remedy stockholder's Peregrine common stock will
be a "substantially disproportionate redemption" if, as a result of the deemed
redemption, the ratio determined by dividing the number of shares of Peregrine
common stock owned by such stockholder immediately after the merger by the total
number of outstanding shares of Peregrine common stock is less than 80% of the
same ratio calculated as if only Peregrine common stock, including Peregrine
common stock with a value equal to the cash portion of the merger consideration,
were issued to the Remedy stockholder in the merger.

    The deemed redemption of a Remedy stockholder's Peregrine common stock will
be "not essentially equivalent to a dividend" if the stockholder experiences a
"meaningful reduction" in his or her proportionate equity interest in Peregrine
by reason of the deemed redemption. Although there are no fixed rules for
determining when a meaningful reduction has occurred, the Internal Revenue
Service has indicated in a published ruling that the receipt of cash in a merger
would not be characterized as a dividend if the stockholder's percentage
ownership interest in the target and the acquiror prior to the merger was
minimal, the stockholder exercises no control over the affairs of the target or
the acquiror, and the stockholder's percentage ownership interest in the
acquiror is reduced in the deemed redemption by any extent.

    If neither of the redemption tests set forth above is satisfied, a Remedy
stockholder will be treated as having received a dividend equal to the amount of
such stockholder's recognized gain, assuming that such stockholder's ratable
share of the earnings and profits of Remedy, and possibly of Peregrine, equals
or exceeds such recognized gain.

    No ruling has been or will be obtained from the Internal Revenue Service in
connection with the merger. Remedy stockholders should be aware that the tax
opinions do not bind the Internal Revenue Service and that the Internal Revenue
Service is therefore not precluded from successfully asserting a contrary
opinion. The tax opinions are also subject to certain assumptions and
qualifications and will be based on the truth and accuracy of certain
representations made by Peregrine, Rose Acquisition Corporation and Remedy,
including, without limitation, representations in certificates to be delivered
to counsel by the respective management of Peregrine, Rose Acquisition
Corporation and Remedy.

    A successful Internal Revenue Service challenge to the reorganization status
of the merger would result in Remedy stockholders recognizing taxable capital
gain or loss with respect to each share of Remedy common stock surrendered equal
to the difference between the Remedy stockholder's tax basis in such share and
the fair market value, as of the closing of the merger, of the Peregrine common
stock plus the cash received in exchange therefor. In such event, a Remedy
stockholder's aggregate basis in the Peregrine common stock so received would
equal its fair market value as of the closing of the

merger and the holding period for such stock would begin the day after the
closing of the merger. In addition, a successful Internal Revenue Service
challenge to the reorganization status of the merger could result in Remedy
recognizing a taxable gain in an amount equal to the difference between the fair
market value of its assets and Remedy's tax basis in its assets.

    Even if the merger qualifies as a reorganization, a stockholder who receives
shares of Peregrine common stock could be required to recognize gain to the
extent that such shares were considered to be received in exchange for services
or property other than solely Remedy common stock. All or a portion of such gain
may be taxable as ordinary income. Gain would also be required to be recognized
to the extent that a stockholder was treated as receiving, directly or
indirectly, consideration other than that described above in exchange for such
stockholder's Remedy common stock.

    Certain noncorporate Remedy stockholders may be subject to backup
withholding at a rate of 31% on cash payments received in the merger. Backup
withholding will not apply, however, to a stockholder who furnishes a correct
taxpayer identification number and certifies that he or she is not subject to
backup withholding on the substitute Form W-9 included in the letter of
transmittal, who provides a certificate of foreign status on an appropriate
Form W-8, or who is otherwise exempt from backup withholding. A stockholder who
fails to provide the correct taxpayer identification number on Form W-9 may be
subject to a $50 penalty imposed by the Internal Revenue Service.

    THE PRECEDING DISCUSSION IS INTENDED ONLY AS A SUMMARY OF CERTAIN UNITED
STATES INCOME TAX CONSEQUENCES OF THE MERGER AND DOES NOT PURPORT TO BE A
COMPLETE ANALYSIS OR DISCUSSION OF ALL POTENTIAL TAX EFFECTS RELEVANT THERETO.
THUS, REMEDY STOCKHOLDERS ARE URGED TO CONSULT THEIR OWN TAX ADVISORS AS TO THE
SPECIFIC TAX CONSEQUENCES TO THEM OF THE MERGER, INCLUDING TAX RETURN REPORTING
REQUIREMENTS, THE APPLICABILITY AND EFFECT OF FOREIGN, FEDERAL, STATE, LOCAL,
AND OTHER APPLICABLE TAX LAWS AND THE EFFECT OF ANY PROPOSED CHANGES IN THE TAX
LAWS.

DELISTING AND DEREGISTRATION OF REMEDY COMMON STOCK

    If the merger is completed, Remedy's common stock will be delisted from the
Nasdaq National Market and will be deregistered under the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934. The stockholders of Remedy will become stockholders of Peregrine,
and their rights as stockholders will be governed by Peregrine's amended and
restated certificate of incorporation, Peregrine's bylaws and the laws of the
State of Delaware. See "Comparison of Rights of Holders of Remedy Common Stock
and Peregrine Common Stock," beginning on page 100.

LISTING OF PEREGRINE COMMON STOCK TO BE ISSUED IN THE MERGER

    It is a condition to the consummation of the merger that Peregrine list the
shares of Peregrine common stock to be issued and reserved in connection with
the merger on the Nasdaq National Market.

CONDUCT OF THE BUSINESS IF THE MERGER IS NOT COMPLETED

    If the merger is not consummated, Remedy will continue to carry on its
business in the usual, regular and ordinary course, consistent with past
practice.

REGULATORY COMPLIANCE

    Under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976 and the rules
that have been promulgated under the act, acquisitions of a sufficient size may
not be consummated unless information has been furnished to the Antitrust
Division of the U.S. Department of Justice and to the Federal Trade Commission
and applicable waiting period requirements have been satisfied or early
termination of the waiting period has been granted. Peregrine's acquisition of
shares of Remedy's common stock pursuant to the merger is subject to the
provisions of that act. Under the act, the transaction cannot be consummated
until the expiration or early termination of the waiting period following the
filing of Hart-Scott-Rodino Notification and Report Forms by Peregrine and
Remedy. Peregrine and Remedy have made the necessary filings and have received
early termination of the waiting period.

    The Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice or the Federal Trade
Commission may challenge the merger on antitrust grounds either before or after
expiration of the waiting period. Accordingly, at any time before or after the
completion of the merger, either the Antitrust Division of the Department of
Justice or the Federal Trade Commission could take action under the antitrust
laws as it deems necessary or desirable in the public interest, or another
person could take action under the antitrust laws, including seeking to enjoin
the merger. Additionally, at any time before or after the completion of the
merger, notwithstanding that the applicable waiting period has expired or ended,
any state could take action under the antitrust laws as it deems necessary or
desirable in the public interest. Peregrine and Remedy cannot be sure that a
challenge to the merger will not be made or that, if a challenge is made,
Peregrine and Remedy will prevail.

    The merger is also subject to regulatory approval by some foreign government
entities. Peregrine and Remedy expect that the merger will not violate any
foreign antitrust laws and that all the foreign antitrust regulatory
authorities, the approval or clearance of which is required, will approve or
clear the merger in a timely manner. Peregrine and Remedy cannot be sure,
however, that a challenge to the merger on antitrust grounds will not be made,
or, if such a challenge is made, what the results will be.

APPRAISAL RIGHTS

    Even if the merger is approved by Remedy's stockholders, any Remedy
stockholder who does not vote in favor of the merger and who has previously
taken necessary steps under Delaware law may exercise rights of appraisal under
Delaware law, rather than receive the merger consideration in the merger.
Generally, under Section 262 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, a
stockholder who:

    - holds shares of Remedy's stock on the date that it makes a demand in
      accordance with Section 262 with respect to those shares,

    - continuously holds those shares through the effective time of the merger,
      and

    - has not voted in favor of approval and adoption of the merger agreement
      and approval of the merger,

will be entitled to an appraisal by the Delaware Court of Chancery of the fair
value of those shares, excluding any appreciation or depreciation resulting from
the anticipation or accomplishment of the merger, together with a fair rate of
interest, if any, to be paid upon the amount determined to be the fair value.
The surviving corporation in the merger will then be required to pay the
stockholder the fair value determined by the court. A stockholder who wishes to
exercise appraisal rights must deliver a written demand for appraisal to Remedy
before the vote of Remedy's stockholders is completed.

    The provisions of Delaware law governing appraisal rights are complex, and
you should study them carefully if you wish to exercise appraisal rights. A
stockholder may take actions that prevent that stockholder from successfully
asserting these rights, and multiple steps must be taken to properly perfect the
rights. A copy of Section 262 of the Delaware General Corporation Law is
attached to this proxy statement/prospectus as Annex E. A more detailed
discussion of appraisal rights under Delaware law is contained in the section
entitled "Appraisal rights" on page 105 of this proxy statement/ prospectus.

FEDERAL SECURITIES LAWS CONSEQUENCES; STOCK TRANSFER RESTRICTIONS

    This proxy statement/prospectus does not cover any resales of the Peregrine
common stock received in the merger, and no person is authorized to make any use
of this proxy statement/prospectus in connection with any such resale.

    All shares of Peregrine common stock received in the merger will be freely
transferable, except that if at the time of the special meeting you are deemed
to be an "affiliate" of Remedy under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, you
may resell those shares only in transactions permitted by Rule 145 under the
Securities Act or as otherwise permitted under the Securities Act. In addition,
the directors and various officers of Remedy have entered into affiliate
agreements that restrict their ability to transfer the shares of Peregrine
common stock that they receive in the merger and restrict their ability to
exercise outstanding options to purchase Remedy common stock held by them.
Persons who may be affiliates of Remedy under the Securities Act generally
include individuals or entities that control, are controlled by, or are under
common control with, Remedy, and would not include stockholders who are not
officers, directors or principal stockholders of Remedy.

INTERESTS OF REMEDY'S DIRECTORS AND EXECUTIVE OFFICERS

    In considering the recommendation of Remedy's board of directors with
respect to the approval and adoption of the merger agreement and approval of the
merger, you should be aware that certain members of the management of Remedy and
Remedy's board of directors may have interests in the merger that are different
from, or in addition to, your interests. Remedy's board of directors was aware
of these interests in approving the merger.

    ASSUMPTION AND ACCELERATION OF STOCK OPTIONS

    Pursuant to the merger agreement, Peregrine will assume each outstanding
stock option under Remedy's 1991 Stock Option/Stock Issuance Plan, 1995 Stock
Option/Stock Issuance Plan, 1995 Non-Employee Directors Stock Option Plan and
2000 Supplemental Stock Option Plan.

    As of June 7, 2001, Remedy's executive officers and directors held options
to purchase a total of 1,733,960 shares of Remedy common stock at a weighted
average exercise price of approximately $23.82 per share, of which options to
purchase 722,006 shares were unvested. All unvested shares of Remedy common
stock and options to purchase Remedy common stock granted to non-employee
directors of Remedy under its 1995 Non-Employee Directors Stock Option Plan will
become fully vested upon completion of the merger. Under the terms of Remedy's
other option plans, the consummation of the merger may cause the vesting of some
of the shares and options outstanding to fully accelerate. Shares and options
outstanding held by employees of Remedy, including officers of Remedy, will
become fully vested in the event of an involuntary or constructive termination
of the employee's employment within 18 months of the merger.

    The following table summarizes the options and restricted stock held by the
identified officers and directors of Remedy as of June 7, 2001:

                                                            UNVESTED EQUITY AWARDS

    EMPLOYEE STOCK PURCHASE PLAN.  Under Remedy's employee stock purchase plan,
eligible employees and officers may purchase up to 3,000 shares of Remedy common
stock through payroll deductions on the earlier of October 31, 2001 or the day
immediately prior to the closing date for the merger at a purchase price that
will not exceed $14.2375 or $15.2915 per share, depending upon when the
individual enrolled in the employee stock purchase plan.

    BOARD SEATS.  Pursuant to the merger agreement, Remedy will be entitled to
designate one director to be appointed to Peregrine's board of directors. Remedy
anticipates that Lawrence L. Garlick will be its designee. Peregrine has agreed
that if it holds its annual meeting of stockholders within six months after the
merger that it will take all commercially reasonable actions to cause Remedy's
designee to be elected or appointed to Peregrine's board of directors at or
immediately after the annual meeting, including increasing the size of its board
of directors or accepting the resignation of incumbent directors.

    INDEMNIFICATION.  Under the merger agreement, Peregrine has agreed, for a
period of six years from the completion of the merger, to honor Remedy's
obligations under indemnification agreements between Remedy and its directors
and officers in effect before the completion of the merger and any
indemnification provisions in Remedy's certificate of incorporation and bylaws.
Peregrine also has agreed to provide for indemnification provisions in the
certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the surviving corporation of the
merger that are at least as favorable as Peregrine's provisions and to maintain
these provisions for six years from the completion of the merger.

    INSURANCE.  Peregrine has agreed to maintain directors' and officers'
liability insurance covering the persons or class of persons who are currently
covered by Remedy's directors' and officers' liability insurance policy for six
years from the completion of the merger, provided that Peregrine is not required
to pay more than 150% of the premium most recently paid for Remedy's directors
and officers' insurance.

    As a result of these interests, the directors and officers of Remedy could
be more likely to vote to approve the merger and merger agreement than if they
did not hold these interests. Remedy's stockholders should consider whether
these interests may have influenced these directors and officers to support or
recommend the merger.

                              THE MERGER AGREEMENT

    THE FOLLOWING IS A SUMMARY OF THE MATERIAL TERMS OF THE MERGER AGREEMENT.
THIS SUMMARY MAY NOT CONTAIN ALL OF THE INFORMATION THAT IS IMPORTANT TO YOU.
THIS SUMMARY IS QUALIFIED IN ITS ENTIRETY BY REFERENCE TO THE MERGER AGREEMENT
ATTACHED AS ANNEX A TO THIS DOCUMENT, WHICH YOU ARE URGED TO CAREFULLY READ IN
ITS ENTIRETY.

STRUCTURE OF THE MERGER

    At the completion of the merger, Remedy will be merged with and into Rose
Acquisition Corporation and Rose Acquisition Corporation will continue as the
surviving corporation of the merger. Under the terms of the merger agreement,
however, Peregrine has the right to change the structure of the merger such that
at the completion of the merger either:

    - Rose Acquisition Corporation will be merged with and into Remedy and
      Remedy will continue as the surviving corporation of the merger; or

    - Remedy will be merged with and into Peregrine and Peregrine will continue
      as the surviving corporation of the merger.

    Peregrine may only restructure the merger described above, however, if the
restructured merger would continue to qualify as a reorganization under the
applicable provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended.

COMPLETION AND EFFECTIVENESS OF THE MERGER

    The merger agreement provides that the merger will close no later than the
second business day following the satisfaction or waiver of each of the
conditions to the merger contained in the merger agreement, including the
approval and adoption of the merger agreement and the approval of the merger by
the stockholders of Remedy.

    The merger will become effective upon the filing of a certificate of merger
with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware under applicable Delaware
law. Peregrine and Remedy expect to file the certificate of merger shortly
following the special meeting of Remedy stockholders at which the merger
agreement and the merger will be presented and voted upon.

    Peregrine and Remedy are working toward satisfying the conditions to the
merger, and completing the merger, as soon as possible. Peregrine and Remedy
currently hope to complete the merger by August 31, 2001, assuming that the
Remedy stockholders adopt and approve the merger agreement and approve the
merger at the special meeting of Remedy stockholders and that the other
conditions to the merger are satisfied promptly. However, because the merger is
subject to governmental and regulatory approvals and other conditions, some of
which are beyond Peregrine's and Remedy's control, Peregrine and Remedy cannot
predict the exact timing of the completion of the merger.

CONVERSION OF REMEDY COMMON STOCK

    As a result of the merger, each outstanding share of Remedy common stock
(other than shares of Remedy common stock held by Remedy, Peregrine or any
subsidiary of Peregrine, and shares held by Remedy stockholders that exercise
dissenters' rights of appraisal under Delaware law), will be converted into the
right to receive $9.00 in cash and 0.9065 of a share of Peregrine common stock.
The specific structure of the merger will not affect in any manner the
conversion of Remedy common stock in the merger or the consideration payable to
holders of Remedy common stock in connection with the merger.

    The cash portion and the stock portion of the merger consideration were
determined based upon Remedy's capitalization representations and warranties in
the merger agreement. In the event that

Remedy's capitalization representations and warranties are determined to be
inaccurate in any respect prior to the effective time of the merger, the cash
portion and the stock portion of the merger consideration will be appropriately
adjusted so that the aggregate amount of cash payable in the merger will not
exceed the aggregate amount of cash that otherwise would have been payable in
the merger had Remedy's capitalization representations and warranties been
accurate, and the aggregate number of shares of Peregrine common stock issuable
in the merger will not exceed the aggregate number of shares of Peregrine common
stock that otherwise would have been issuable in the merger had Remedy's
capitalization representations and warranties been accurate.

    In addition, the cash and stock consideration payable in respect of each
share of Remedy common stock in connection with the merger will be adjusted to
reflect the effect of any stock split, reverse stock split, stock dividend,
extraordinary cash dividend, reorganization, recapitalization, reclassification,
combination, exchange of shares or other like change with respect to shares of
Remedy common stock that is effected prior to the completion of the merger. The
stock consideration payable in respect of each share of Remedy common stock in
connection with the merger will be adjusted to reflect the effect of any of the
foregoing events that is effected in respect of shares of Peregrine common stock
prior to the completion of the merger.

    Peregrine will not issue any fractional shares in the merger. Instead of
receiving a fractional share of Peregrine common stock, each holder of Remedy
common stock will receive an amount of cash equal in value to the fraction of a
share of Peregrine common stock that such holder would have otherwise been
entitled to receive in connection with the merger after aggregating all of the
stock consideration payable to such holder.

EXCHANGE OF REMEDY CERTIFICATES FOR CASH AND STOCK CONSIDERATION

    Promptly after the completion of the merger, the exchange agent will mail
transmittal forms and exchange instructions to each holder of record of Remedy
common stock. These forms will be used to surrender and exchange certificates
formerly evidencing shares of Remedy common stock for the cash and stock
consideration payable in connection with the merger. Each holder of a
certificate formerly representing shares of Remedy common stock will be entitled
to surrender the certificate and the completed transmittal form to the exchange
agent in exchange for:

    - an amount of cash equal to the number of shares evidenced by the
      certificate multiplied by $9.00;

    - a certificate evidencing the number of whole shares of Peregrine common
      stock into which the shares of Remedy common stock formerly evidenced by
      the certificate have been converted; and

    - any cash that may be payable in lieu of a fractional share of Peregrine
      common stock to the holder of the certificate.

    The transmittal forms will be accompanied by instructions specifying other
details of the exchange.

REMEDY STOCKHOLDERS SHOULD NOT RETURN THEIR REMEDY STOCK CERTIFICATES UNTIL THEY
RECEIVE A TRANSMITTAL FORM AND INSTRUCTIONS FROM THE EXCHANGE AGENT.

    Following the completion of the merger, the holders of unexchanged
certificates formerly evidencing shares of Remedy common stock will not be
entitled to receive any dividends or other distributions payable by Peregrine to
the holders of Peregrine common stock with a record date after the completion of
the merger unless and until the holders surrender their stock certificates for
exchange. Promptly after Peregrine stock certificates are issued in exchange for
surrendered Remedy stock certificates, the holders of the surrendered stock
certificates will receive any dividends or other distributions paid or payable
by Peregrine to the holders of Peregrine common stock with a record date after
the completion of the merger, without interest.

    Peregrine will only issue a Peregrine stock certificate in a name other than
the name in which a surrendered Remedy stock certificate is registered if the
holder of the certificate presents the exchange agent with all documents
required to effect the unrecorded transfer of ownership of the shares of Remedy
common stock formerly evidenced by the surrendered Remedy stock certificate, and
shows that all applicable stock transfer taxes payable in connection with the
transfer have been paid.

    If a Remedy stock certificate has been lost, stolen or destroyed, the record
holder of the lost, stolen or destroyed stock certificate may be required to
deliver an affidavit and a lost certificate bond as a condition to receiving the
cash and stock consideration payable in respect of the shares of Remedy common
stock evidenced by the lost, stolen or destroyed stock certificate.

TREATMENT OF REMEDY STOCK OPTIONS AND PURCHASE RIGHTS UNDER THE REMEDY EMPLOYEE
  STOCK PURCHASE PLAN

    TREATMENT OF REMEDY STOCK OPTIONS.  At the completion of the merger, each
outstanding option to purchase Remedy common stock, whether vested or unvested,
will be assumed by Peregrine and become an option to purchase shares of
Peregrine common stock. The Remedy stock options assumed by Peregrine will
continue to be subject to the same terms and conditions that applied to the
stock options prior to the merger (including vesting terms and conditions),
except that:

    - each stock option will be exercisable for a number of shares of Peregrine
      common stock equal to the product obtained by multiplying the number of
      shares of Remedy common stock that were issuable upon the exercise of the
      stock option prior to the merger by the OPTION EXCHANGE RATIO (rounded
      down to the nearest whole number of shares of Peregrine common stock); and

    - the per share exercise price of each stock option will be equal to the
      quotient obtained by dividing the exercise price per share of each such
      stock option prior to the merger by the OPTION EXCHANGE RATIO (rounded up
      to the nearest whole cent).

    The OPTION EXCHANGE RATIO is the sum of the following:

    - 0.9065; and

    - the quotient obtained by dividing $9.00 by the fair market value of one
      share of Peregrine common stock at the effective time of the merger.

    Peregrine will file a registration statement on Form S-8 within 30 days of
the effective time of the merger to register under the Securities Act of 1933
the issuance and resale of the shares of Peregrine common stock issuable upon
the exercise of the Remedy stock options assumed by Peregrine in connection with
the merger.

    TREATMENT OF PURCHASE RIGHTS UNDER REMEDY EMPLOYEE STOCK PURCHASE
PLAN.  Under the terms of the merger agreement, Remedy has agreed to take all
steps necessary to terminate its employee stock purchase plan either on the day
immediately prior to the completion of the merger, or the last day of the last
full payroll period ending immediately prior to the completion of the merger.
Outstanding purchase rights under the Remedy employee stock purchase plan may be
exercised at the time of the termination of the plan, and each share of Remedy
common stock purchased as a result of such exercise will be converted into the
right to receive the cash and stock consideration payable in respect of shares
of Remedy common stock in connection with the merger.

RESTRICTIONS ON SOLICITATION OF ALTERNATIVE TRANSACTIONS BY REMEDY

    Under the terms of the merger agreement, Remedy agreed to cease, as of the
date of the merger agreement, any and all existing activities, discussions or
negotiations with any parties other than Peregrine conducted prior to the date
of the merger agreement with respect to any ACQUISITION PROPOSAL.

    Under the terms of the merger agreement, an ACQUISITION PROPOSAL is any
offer or proposal relating to an ACQUISITION TRANSACTION (other than an offer or
proposal from Peregrine), and an ACQUISITION TRANSACTION is any transaction or
series of related transactions (other than the merger) involving any of the
following:

    - the acquisition or purchase from Remedy by any person or group of more
      than a 15% interest in the total outstanding voting securities of Remedy
      or any of its subsidiaries;

    - any tender offer or exchange offer that if consummated would result in any
      person or group beneficially owning 15% or more of the total outstanding
      voting securities of Remedy or any of its subsidiaries;

    - any merger, consolidation, business combination or similar transaction
      involving Remedy in which the stockholders of Remedy immediately preceding
      such transaction hold less than 85% of the equity interests in the
      surviving or resulting entity of such transaction;

    - any sale, lease outside the ordinary course of business, exchange,
      transfer, license outside the ordinary course of business, acquisition or
      disposition of more than 15% of the assets of Remedy; or

    - any liquidation, dissolution, recapitalization or significant corporate
      reorganization of Remedy.

    Until the merger is completed or the merger agreement is terminated, under
the terms of the merger agreement, Remedy further agreed that neither it nor any
of its subsidiaries will (nor will they authorize or permit any of their
respective officers, directors, affiliates or employees or any of their
investment bankers, attorneys or other advisors or representatives to):

    - solicit, initiate, encourage or induce the making, submission or
      announcement of any ACQUISITION PROPOSAL;

    - subject to certain limited exceptions applicable upon receipt of a
      SUPERIOR PROPOSAL, as described below, participate in any discussions or
      negotiations regarding, or furnish non-public information with respect to,
      any ACQUISITION PROPOSAL;

    - subject to certain limited exceptions applicable upon receipt of a
      SUPERIOR PROPOSAL, as described below, engage in discussions with any
      person with respect to any ACQUISITION PROPOSAL;

    - subject to certain limited exceptions applicable upon receipt of a
      SUPERIOR PROPOSAL, as described below, approve, endorse or recommend any
      ACQUISITION PROPOSAL; or

    - enter into any letter of intent or similar document or any contract,
      agreement or commitment contemplating or otherwise relating to any
      ACQUISITION TRANSACTION.

    Any violation of any of the restrictions described in the preceding
paragraph by any officer or director of Remedy or any of its subsidiaries, or
any investment banker, attorney or other advisor or representative of Remedy or
any of its subsidiaries is deemed to be a breach of the relevant restriction by
Remedy.

    Under the terms of the merger agreement, Remedy has agreed to inform
Peregrine, as promptly as practicable, orally and in writing, of any request
received by Remedy for non-public information that Remedy reasonably believes
would lead to a bona fide ACQUISITION PROPOSAL, or of any ACQUISITION

PROPOSAL, or any inquiry received by Remedy with respect to or which Remedy
reasonably believes could lead to a bona fide ACQUISITION PROPOSAL, the material
terms and conditions of such request, ACQUISITION PROPOSAL or inquiry, and the
identity of the person or group making any such request, ACQUISITION PROPOSAL or
inquiry. Remedy further agreed to keep Peregrine informed of the status and
details, including material amendments or proposed amendments, of any such
request, ACQUISITION PROPOSAL or inquiry.

    Remedy is expressly permitted, however, to furnish non-public information
regarding Remedy and its subsidiaries to, and to enter into a confidentiality
agreement or discussions with, any person or group in response to a bona fide
ACQUISITION PROPOSAL submitted by the person or group, and not withdrawn, if all
of the following conditions are met:

    - the Remedy board of directors reasonably concludes in good faith, after
      consultation with a financial advisor of nationally recognized reputation,
      that the ACQUISITION PROPOSAL constitutes a SUPERIOR PROPOSAL;

    - neither Remedy nor any of its representatives, or subsidiaries has
      breached the non-solicitation provisions contained in the merger agreement
      described above;

    - the Remedy board of directors reasonably concludes in good faith, after
      consultation with its outside legal counsel, that in light of the SUPERIOR
      PROPOSAL such action is required in order for the Remedy board of
      directors to comply with its fiduciary duties to Remedy's stockholders
      under Delaware law;

    - at least two business days prior to furnishing any such information to, or
      entering into discussions or negotiations with, the person or group,
      Remedy gives Peregrine written notice of the identity of such person or
      group and of Remedy's intention to furnish information to, or enter into
      discussion or negotiations with, such person or group, and Remedy receives
      from such person or group an executed confidentiality agreement containing
      customary limitations on the use and disclosure of all non-public written
      and oral information furnished to such person or group by or on behalf of
      Remedy; and

    - contemporaneously with furnishing any non-public information to the person
      or group, Remedy furnishes the same non-public information to Peregrine,
      to the extent such non-public information has not been previously
      furnished by Remedy to Peregrine.

    Under the terms of the merger agreement, a SUPERIOR PROPOSAL is an
ACQUISITION PROPOSAL involving the acquisition of at least a majority of the
outstanding voting securities of Remedy and with respect to which the Remedy
board of directors reasonably determines in good faith, after consultation with
a financial advisor of nationally recognized reputation, and after taking into
account the legal, financial and regulatory aspects of the ACQUISITION PROPOSAL
and the person making the ACQUISITION PROPOSAL:

    - that the acquiring person is capable of consummating the proposed
      ACQUISITION TRANSACTION on the terms proposed; and

    - that the proposed ACQUISITION TRANSACTION would, if consummated, be more
      favorable to Remedy's stockholders, from a financial point of view, than
      the merger.

    Under the terms of the merger agreement, Remedy has agreed to provide
Peregrine with at least 48 hours prior notice of any meeting of the Remedy board
of directors at which the Remedy board of directors is reasonably expected to
consider an ACQUISITION PROPOSAL. Furthermore, Remedy has agreed to provide
Peregrine with at least 24 hours prior written notice of a meeting of the Remedy
board of directors at which the Remedy board of directors is reasonably expected
to approve, endorse or recommend a SUPERIOR PROPOSAL to Remedy's stockholders
(together with a copy of the definitive documentation relating to such SUPERIOR
PROPOSAL).

OBLIGATION OF REMEDY'S BOARD OF DIRECTORS TO RECOMMEND APPROVAL OF THE MERGER
  AGREEMENT AND THE MERGER

    Subject to the exceptions described below, under the terms of the merger
agreement, the Remedy board of directors has agreed to recommend that Remedy's
stockholders vote in favor of adoption and approval of the merger agreement and
the approval of the merger. However, the Remedy board of directors may withhold,
withdraw, amend or modify its recommendation in favor of the merger agreement
and the merger if:

    - Remedy receives a SUPERIOR PROPOSAL which is not withdrawn;

    - neither Remedy nor any of its representatives has violated the
      non-solicitation provisions contained in the merger agreement; and

    - the Remedy board of directors concludes in good faith, after consultation
      with its outside legal counsel, that in light of the SUPERIOR PROPOSAL,
      such action is required in order for the Remedy board of directors to
      comply with its fiduciary duties to Remedy's stockholders under Delaware
      law.

    Remedy's board of directors must give Peregrine at least 72 hours notice of
any proposal to change its recommendation in favor of the merger agreement and
the merger. If the Remedy board of directors determines to withhold, withdraw,
amend or modify its recommendation in favor of the merger agreement and the
merger, however, Remedy must nevertheless convene and hold the special meeting
of Remedy stockholders for the purpose of voting on the merger agreement and the
merger.

    Remedy's board of directors may also make any disclosure (including a change
in its recommendation in favor of the adoption and approval of the merger
agreement and the approval of the merger) required for the Remedy board of
directors to comply with its duty of candor to the Remedy stockholders if the
Remedy board of directors concludes in good faith, after consultation with its
outside legal counsel, that the disclosure in question is required in order for
it to comply with its fiduciary duties to Remedy's stockholders under Delaware
law.

RIGHT TO DESIGNATE PEREGRINE DIRECTOR

    After completion of the merger, Remedy will be entitled to designate one
member on the Peregrine board of directors, who will serve for an initial term
ending on the date of the next scheduled annual meeting of Peregrine
stockholders. Remedy anticipates that its designee will be Lawrence L. Garlick.
However, if the next annual meeting of Peregrine stockholders is scheduled to
occur within six months of the completion of the merger, Peregrine has agreed to
use take commercially reasonable actions to cause the person designated by
Remedy to serve on the Peregrine board of directors to be elected or appointed
to the Peregrine board of directors at or immediately after the next annual
meeting of Peregrine stockholders, including by either increasing the size of
Peregrine's board of directors or accepting the resignation of another Peregrine
director.

AMENDMENT TO REMEDY RIGHTS PLAN

    In connection with entering into the merger agreement, Remedy entered into
an amendment to its rights agreement with Computershare Investor Services LLC so
as to render the rights agreement inapplicable to Peregrine and its affiliates
generally, and inapplicable to the merger agreement, the voting agreements and
the merger specifically. If the merger agreement is terminated in accordance
with its terms, other than a termination by Remedy because of an uncured breach
by Peregrine of its representations, warranties, covenants or agreements in the
merger agreement, Remedy has agreed that it will not amend this rights agreement
amendment for a period of six months following such termination.

    In addition, under the terms of the merger agreement, Remedy has agreed
that, unless the merger agreement is terminated, Remedy will not amend or
modify, or take any action with respect to its rights agreement, so as to:

    - render the rights agreement inapplicable to any transaction other than the
      merger;

    - permit any third party (other than Peregrine, Rose Acquisition Corporation
      or any of their respective affiliates) who would otherwise become an
      "Acquiring Person" (as that term is defined under the rights agreement)
      under the rights agreement to not so become an "Acquiring Person" under
      the rights agreement;

    - provide that a "Distribution Date" or a "Stock Acquisition Date" (as those
      terms are defined under the rights agreement) or similar event under the
      rights agreement does not occur by reason of the execution of any
      agreement other than the merger agreement and the voting agreements;

    - otherwise affect the rights of holders of rights issued or issuable under
      the rights agreement; or

    - otherwise render the rights agreement applicable to Peregrine, Rose
      Acquisition Corporation or their respective affiliates.

CONDITIONS TO COMPLETION OF THE MERGER

      any such foreign jurisdiction;

    - no stop orders suspending the effectiveness of the registration statement
      of which this document forms a part, or any similar proceeding in respect

      the Securities and Exchange Commission;

    - if required, the shares of Peregrine common stock to be issued in the
      merger must have been authorized for listing on the Nasdaq National

    Remedy's obligations to complete the merger and the other transactions
contemplated by the merger agreement are subject to the satisfaction or waiver

      true and correct as of June 10, 2001, and

      must continue to be true and correct on and as of the date the merger is
      to be completed as if made on such date, except:

       - to the extent Peregrine's and Rose Acquisition Corporation's
         representations and warranties address matters only as of a particular
         date, they must be true and correct only as of that date;

       - to the extent that any inaccuracies of such representations and
         breaches of such warranties do not in any case, or in the aggregate,
         have a MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT, as defined below, on Peregrine and Rose
         Acquisition Corporation; or

       - for changes contemplated by the merger agreement;

    - Peregrine and Rose Acquisition Corporation must have performed or complied
      in all material respects with all of their agreements and covenants
      required by the merger agreement to be performed or complied with by
      Peregrine and Rose prior to the completion of the merger.

       - to the extent Remedy's representations and warranties address matters
         only as of a particular date, they must be true and correct only as of

       - to the extent that any inaccuracies of such representations and
         breaches of such warranties do not in any case, or in the aggregate,
         have a MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT on Remedy; or

       - for changes contemplated by the merger agreement;

    - Remedy must have performed or complied in all material respects with all
      of its agreements and covenants required by the merger agreement to be
      performed or complied with by Remedy prior to the completion of the
      merger.

TERMINATION OF THE MERGER AGREEMENT

    The merger agreement may be terminated at any time prior to the completion
of the merger, whether before or after adoption and approval of the merger
agreement and approval of the merger by Remedy's stockholders:

    - by mutual written consent duly authorized by the boards of directors of
      Peregrine and Remedy;

    - by Peregrine or Remedy, if the merger is not completed before October 31,
      2001, or in the event that the merger has not been consummated on or
      before October 31, 2001 solely as a result of the failure to obtain all
      regulatory approvals required to complete the merger, Peregrine and Remedy
      may only terminate the merger agreement following two successive 30 day
      periods ending November 30, 2001 and December 31, 2001, except that either
      party's right to terminate the merger agreement under this provision will
      not be available to any party whose failure to fulfill any obligation
      under the merger agreement has been the principal cause of, or resulted in
      the failure of, the merger to occur on or before such dates, and such
      action or failure to act constitutes a material breach of the merger
      agreement;

    - by Peregrine or Remedy, if Remedy's stockholders fail to adopt and approve
      the merger agreement and approve the merger at the special meeting of
      Remedy stockholders at which the merger agreement and the merger are
      presented and voted upon, except that Remedy's right to

      terminate the merger agreement under this provision will not be available
      to Remedy where the failure to obtain the requisite approval of Remedy's
      stockholders was caused by Remedy's action or failure to act and such
      action or failure to act constitutes a material breach of the merger
      agreement;

    - by Peregrine or Remedy, if any law or regulation is enacted that renders
      the merger illegal, or if any governmental authority issues a final and
      nonappealable judgment, injunction or other order that permanently
      restrains, enjoins or otherwise prohibits Peregrine or Remedy from
      completing the merger;

    - by Remedy, upon a breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or
      agreement of Peregrine contained in the merger agreement such that the
      condition to Remedy's obligation to complete the merger would not be
      satisfied at the time of such breach. However, if the breach or inaccuracy
      is curable by Peregrine through the exercise of its commercially
      reasonable efforts, and Peregrine continues to exercise commercially
      reasonable efforts to cure the breach, Remedy may not terminate the merger
      agreement for 30 days after delivery of written notice to Peregrine of the
      breach. If the breach or inaccuracy is cured during those 30 days, Remedy
      may not terminate the merger agreement under this provision;

    - by Remedy, prior to entering into a definitive agreement with respect to a
      SUPERIOR PROPOSAL, provided that:

       - Remedy has not breached the non-solicitation provisions contained in
         the merger agreement;

       - the Remedy board of directors has authorized Remedy to enter into a
         definitive agreement with respect to the SUPERIOR PROPOSAL in
         accordance with the terms of the merger agreement;

       - Remedy notifies Peregrine in writing that Remedy has received an
         ACQUISITION PROPOSAL that constitutes a SUPERIOR PROPOSAL and intends
         to enter into a definitive agreement with respect to the SUPERIOR
         PROPOSAL, for the purpose of enabling Peregrine and Remedy to discuss
         in good faith a modification of the terms and conditions of the merger
         agreement so that the merger may be effected;

       - Peregrine does not make, within five business days after receiving
         Remedy's written notice of its intention to enter into a definitive
         agreement with respect to the SUPERIOR PROPOSAL, an offer that the
         Remedy board of directors reasonably determines in good faith, after
         consultation with a financial advisor of nationally recognized
         reputation and its outside legal counsel, is at least as favorable to
         Remedy's stockholders as the SUPERIOR PROPOSAL; and

       - concurrently with terminating the merger agreement, Remedy pays
         Peregrine the termination fee described below and enters into the
         definitive agreement with respect to the SUPERIOR PROPOSAL;

    - by Peregrine, upon a breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or
      agreement of Remedy contained in the merger agreement such that the
      condition to Peregrine's obligation to complete the merger would not be
      satisfied at the time of such breach. However, if the breach or inaccuracy
      is curable by Remedy through the exercise of its commercially reasonable
      efforts, and Remedy continues to exercise commercially reasonable efforts
      to cure the breach, Peregrine may not terminate the merger agreement for
      30 days after delivery of written notice to Remedy of the breach. If the
      breach or inaccuracy is cured during those 30 days, Peregrine may not
      terminate the merger agreement under this provision; or

    - by Peregrine, if a TRIGGERING EVENT occurs.

    Under the terms of the merger agreement, a TRIGGERING EVENT is deemed to
have occurred if:

       - the Remedy board of directors for any reason, directly or indirectly,
         withholds, withdraws, amends or modifies (including by virtue of taking
         any position or making any disclosure that the Remedy board of
         directors determines to be necessary in order to comply with its
         fiduciary duty of candor to Remedy's stockholders under Delaware law)
         its recommendation in favor of the adoption and approval of the merger
         agreement and the approval of the merger;

       - Remedy fails to include in this document its recommendation in favor of
         the adoption and approval of the merger agreement and the approval of
         the merger;

       - the Remedy board of directors or any committee of the Remedy board of
         directors approves or recommends that Remedy's stockholders approve an
         ACQUISITION PROPOSAL;

       - Remedy enters into any letter of intent or similar agreement, contract
         or commitment accepting an ACQUISITION PROPOSAL; or

       - a tender or exchange offer relating to the securities of Remedy is
         commenced by a person unaffiliated with Peregrine, and Remedy does not
         send to its securityholders within 10 business days after such tender
         or exchange offer is first published, sent or given, a statement
         reaffirming the recommendation of the Remedy board of directors in
         favor of the merger agreement and the merger and recommending rejection
         of the tender or exchange offer.

PAYMENT OF TERMINATION FEE

    Under the terms of the merger agreement, Remedy must pay Peregrine a
termination fee of $40 million if Peregrine terminates the merger agreement upon
the occurrence of a TRIGGERING EVENT. In addition, Remedy must pay Peregrine a
termination fee of $40 million if Remedy terminates the merger agreement in
order to enter into a definitive agreement with respect to a SUPERIOR PROPOSAL
in accordance with the terms of the merger agreement.

    Under the terms of the merger agreement, Remedy also must pay Peregrine a
termination fee of $40 million if the merger agreement is terminated by
Peregrine or Remedy because the merger is not consummated by October 31, 2001
(or December 31, 2001 if the merger is not completed by October 31, 2001 solely
due to a failure to obtain all regulatory approvals required to complete the
merger), or because Remedy's stockholders fail to adopt and approve the merger
agreement and approve the merger, and if the following have occurred:

    - prior to the termination of the merger agreement, an ACQUISITION PROPOSAL
      is publicly announced or has become publicly known and has not been
      publicly and unconditionally withdrawn, and

    - within 12 months following the termination of the merger agreement, either
      a COMPANY ACQUISITION is completed, or Remedy enters into a letter of
      intent or other agreement providing for a COMPANY ACQUISITION and the
      COMPANY ACQUISITION is later consummated.

    Under the terms of the merger agreement, Remedy also must pay Peregrine a
termination fee of $40 million if the merger agreement is terminated by
Peregrine because Remedy has breached a material covenant or agreement in the
merger agreement or because the representations and warranties of Remedy
contained in the merger agreement have become inaccurate to such an extent as to
constitute a MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT on Remedy, and if the following have
occurred:

    - prior to the termination of the merger agreement, an ACQUISITION PROPOSAL
      is publicly announced or has become publicly known and has not been
      publicly and unconditionally withdrawn, and

    - within 12 months following the termination of the merger agreement, either
      a COMPANY ACQUISITION is completed, or Remedy enters into a letter of
      intent or other agreement providing for a COMPANY ACQUISITION and the
      COMPANY ACQUISITION is later consummated.

    Under the terms of the merger agreement, a COMPANY ACQUISITION consists of
any of the following:

    - a merger, consolidation, business combination, recapitalization,
      liquidation, dissolution or similar transaction involving Remedy pursuant
      to which the stockholders of Remedy immediately preceding such transaction
      hold less than 50% of the aggregate equity interests in the surviving or
      resulting entity of the transaction;

    - a sale or other disposition by Remedy of assets representing in excess of
      50% of the aggregate fair market value of Remedy's business immediately
      prior to such sale; or

    - the acquisition by any person or group, including by way of a tender offer
      or an exchange offer or issuance by Remedy, directly or indirectly, of
      beneficial ownership or a right to acquire beneficial ownership of shares
      representing in excess of 50% of the voting power of the then outstanding
      shares of capital stock of Remedy.

EXTENSION, WAIVER AND AMENDMENT OF THE MERGER AGREEMENT

    Peregrine, Rose Acquisition Corporation and Remedy may amend the merger
agreement before completion of the merger by the written consent of all parties.

    Either Peregrine or Remedy may extend the other party's time for the
performance of any of the obligations or other acts under the merger agreement,
waive any inaccuracies in the other's representations and warranties and waive
compliance by the other party with any of the agreements or conditions contained
in the merger agreement.

DEFINITION OF MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT

    Under the terms of the merger agreement, a MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT on either
Peregrine or Remedy is defined to mean any change or effect that, individually
or when taken together with all other such changes or effects that have occurred
prior to the date of determination of the occurrence of the MATERIAL ADVERSE
EFFECT, is or is reasonably likely to be materially adverse to the business,
assets (including intangible assets), financial condition or results of
operations of such entity and its subsidiaries taken as a whole. However, under
the terms of the merger agreement, none of the following are deemed to
constitute, nor shall they be taken into account in determining whether there
has been or will be, a MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT on any entity (provided that the
party asserting the exceptions noted in the first, second, fourth and fifth
bullet points below shows by a preponderance of the evidence that such changes
result from compliance with the terms of the merger agreement or the pendency of
the merger):

    - any change resulting from compliance with the terms and conditions of the
      merger agreement;

    - any change resulting from the pendency of the merger or any other
      transactions contemplated by the merger agreement (including, without
      limitation, any cancellation or deferral of product or service orders by
      customers);

    - any change in the entity's stock price or trading volume or any failure by
      the entity to meet internal projections or forecasts or published revenue
      or earnings projections, in each case in and of itself;

    - any change or effect that results or arises from changes affecting any of
      the industries in which the entity operates generally or the United States
      economy generally (which changes or effects in each case do not
      disproportionately affect the entity in any material respect); or

    - any change or effect that results or arises from changes affecting general
      worldwide economic or capital market conditions (which changes in each
      case do not disproportionately affect such entity in any material
      respect).

EXPENSES

    Each party will pay all fees and expenses it incurs in connection with the
merger, except that Peregrine and Remedy will share equally all fees and
expenses (other than attorneys' and accountants' fees and expenses) incurred in
connection with the printing, filing and mailing of this document and the
registration statement of which this document forms a part, and any amendments
and supplements to the same, and any filing fees required to be paid under the
Hart Scott Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976 or any foreign antitrust
laws and regulations in connection with the merger.

REMEDY STOCKHOLDERS' VOTING AGREEMENT

    As a condition to Peregrine's entering into the merger agreement, Peregrine
and each of Lawrence L. Garlick, Richard P. Allocco, Ron J. Fior, Gary Oliver,
Harold Goldberg, Sheri Anderson, Harvey C. Jones, Jr., David A. Mahler, John F.
Olsen and John F. Shoch entered into voting agreements. By entering into the
voting agreements, these Remedy stockholders have irrevocably appointed
Peregrine as their lawful attorney and proxy. These proxies give Peregrine the
limited right to vote all of the shares of Remedy common stock beneficially
owned by these Remedy stockholders, including shares of Remedy common stock
acquired after the date of the voting agreements, as follows:

    - in favor of the adoption and approval of the merger agreement and the
      approval of the merger, and in favor of each of the other actions
      contemplated by the merger agreement and the proxy and any action required
      in furtherance thereof;

    - against approval of any proposal made in opposition to, or in competition
      with, consummation of the merger and the other transactions contemplated
      by the merger agreement;

    - against any of the following actions (other than those actions that relate
      to the merger and the other transactions contemplated by the merger
      agreement): (i) any merger, consolidation, business combination, sale of
      assets, reorganization or recapitalization of Remedy or any subsidiary of
      Remedy with any person, (ii) any sale, lease or transfer of any
      significant part of the assets of Remedy or any subsidiary of Remedy,
      (iii) any reorganization, recapitalization, dissolution, liquidation or
      winding up of Remedy or any subsidiary of Remedy, (iv) any change in the
      capitalization of Remedy or any subsidiary of Remedy, or the corporate
      structure of Remedy or any subsidiary of Remedy, or (v) any other action
      that is intended, or could reasonably be expected to, impede, interfere
      with, delay, postpone, discourage or adversely affect the merger or any of
      the other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement; and

    - in favor of waiving any notice that may have been or may be required
      relating to any reorganization of Remedy or any subsidiary of Remedy, any
      reclassification or recapitalization of the capital stock of Remedy or any
      subsidiary of Remedy, or any sale of assets, change of control, or
      acquisition of Remedy or any subsidiary of Remedy by any other person, or
      any consolidation or merger of Remedy or any subsidiary of Remedy with or
      into any other person.

    As of the record date, these individuals collectively beneficially owned
3,206,990 shares of Remedy common stock or approximately 10.4% of the
outstanding Remedy common stock. All of these shares are subject to the voting
agreement. None of the Remedy stockholders who are parties to the voting
agreements were paid additional consideration in connection with these
agreements.

    Under the voting agreements, each of these Remedy stockholders agreed not to
sell the Remedy common stock and options owned, controlled or acquired, either
directly or indirectly, by that person until the earlier of the termination of
the merger agreement or the completion of the merger, unless the transfer is in
accordance with the voting agreement and each person to which any shares or any
interest in any shares is transferred agrees to be bound by the terms and
provisions of the voting agreement. These voting agreements will terminate upon
the earlier to occur of the termination of the merger agreement or the
completion of the merger.

    The form of voting agreement is attached as Annex B to this proxy
statement/prospectus.

AFFILIATE AGREEMENTS

    In order to induce Peregrine to enter into the merger agreement, each of
Peregrine, Remedy, Lawrence L. Garlick, Richard P. Allocco, Ron J. Fior, Gary
Oliver, Harold Goldberg, Sheri Anderson, Harvey C. Jones, Jr., David A. Mahler,
John F. Olsen and John F. Shoch entered into affiliate agreements at Peregrine's
request. Each of the individuals who is a party to an affiliate agreement is a
director or an executive officer of Remedy and, therefore, is an affiliate of
Remedy. Pursuant to the terms of the affiliate agreements, each of the
individuals who are parties to the agreement represented the following:

    - all shares of Remedy common stock listed on the signature page to the
      affiliate agreement are held and beneficially owned by the affiliate;

    - all options to purchase Remedy common stock listed on the signature page
      are held by the affiliate;

    - the affiliate does not own, of record or beneficially, directly or
      indirectly to the affiliate agreement, any securities of Remedy other than
      the shares and options listed on the signature page; and

    - the affiliate has carefully read the affiliate agreement and, to the
      extent the affiliate felt necessary, has discussed with counsel the
      limitations imposed on the affiliate's ability to sell, transfer or
      otherwise dispose of the shares of Peregrine common stock to be received
      in the merger. The affiliate fully understands the limitations the
      affiliate agreement places upon the affiliate's ability to sell, transfer
      or otherwise dispose of the Peregrine shares to be received in merger and
      to exercise the affiliate's options.

    Pursuant to the affiliate agreements, each affiliate has agreed not to sell,
transfer or otherwise dispose of any Peregrine common stock issued in the merger
unless one of the following conditions is met:

    - the sale, transfer or other disposition is made pursuant to an effective
      registration statement under the Securities Act;

    - the sale, transfer or other disposition is made in conformity with the
      applicable requirements of Rule 145 promulgated under the Securities Act;

    - counsel reasonably satisfactory to Peregrine shall have advised Peregrine
      in a written opinion letter, reasonably acceptable to Peregrine in form
      and substance and upon which Peregrine may rely, that such sale, transfer
      or other disposition will be exempt from the registration requirements
      under the Securities Act; or

    - an authorized representative of the SEC shall have rendered written advice
      to the affiliate to the effect that the SEC would take no action, or that
      the staff of the SEC would not recommend that the SEC take action, with
      respect to such sale, transfer or other disposition, and a copy of such
      written advice and all other related communications with the SEC shall
      have been delivered to Peregrine.

    Peregrine has agreed to use its reasonable efforts to timely make all
filings required to be made by it under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as
amended, to furnish to the affiliates a written statement to that effect during
the 12 months preceding a proposed sale and to otherwise use its reasonable
efforts to permit sales by affiliates pursuant to Rule 145.

                             BUSINESS OF PEREGRINE

    Peregrine is a leading global provider of software and services that are
designed to reduce the frictional cost of doing business for their client's
organizations. Peregrine offers products and services to address three principal
domains:

    - infrastructure resource management;

    - employee relationship management (or self service); and

    - e-commerce technologies and services.

    Peregrine offers software products, services, and enabling technologies that
permit businesses to eliminate points of friction in their business processes
and to improve their returns on capital and investment in their infrastructure
assets and electronic business investments. Peregrine's solutions are intended
to make their customers more competitive in their markets by removing the
friction points associated with three primary business processes:

    - life cycle management of infrastructure assets, from the point of
      procurement through deployment, use, maintenance, change, and ultimately
      disposition;

    - employee procurement of the infrastructure required to do their jobs,
      including e-procurement, employee self service, knowledge access, and
      reservation of shared assets, such as conference rooms and office space in
      remote locations; and

    - e-transaction management, which eliminates friction points among buyers,
      suppliers, and market places as Peregrine's customers attempt to transact
      business through a global web of connected trading partners.

    Peregrine is organized to provide its solution to customers through three
groups:

    - the infrastructure management group, referred to as "IMG";

    - the e-markets group, referred to as "EMG"; and

    - the integrated solutions group, referred to as "ISG."

    Peregrine's infrastructure management group provides software, technologies,
and services to optimize and manage the procurement, maintenance, and
disposition of business infrastructure. Peregrine believes the use of their
products can result in more efficient deployment of capital and other resources
and can lower the cost of operating and maintaining organizational
infrastructure. Peregrine offers management solutions for diverse categories of
business assets, including technology equipment and systems, telecommunications
networks, corporate vehicle fleets, and physical plant and facilities.
Peregrine's products offer complete life cycle management of infrastructure
assets. At the beginning of the cycle, Peregrine offers technologies and
services that enable buyers and sellers of infrastructure assets to purchase and
sell assets electronically over the Internet. Once an asset has been made
available for automated purchase or lease, Peregrine then automates and
facilitates the management and maintenance of the asset as well as its ultimate
disposition. In addition, Peregrine's employee relationship management
applications offer individual employees direct access to the resources, help,
information, or infrastructure they require.

    Peregrine's e-markets group provides a suite of business-to-business
software products and services to facilitate the processes of selling and
purchasing direct goods among trading partners. Specifically, Peregrine's
e-markets group focuses on creating and delivering technology and services that
enable e-commerce. Peregrine provides fundamental connection, transformation,
cataloging, enterprise application integration, and business-to-business process
integration in order to remove the frictional costs from the processes of
electronic commerce. The e-markets group provides vertically focused solutions
for electronic commerce that are primarily focused on the automotive, energy,
industrial

component, and retail/distribution industries. Peregrine believes that the
combination of its technologies as well as its hosted network service offerings
can result in lower costs and higher reliability and ease of use for creating
business-to-business connections using the Internet.

    In April 2001, Peregrine announced the creation of its integrated solutions
group. Peregrine created this group specifically to respond to the requirements
of their large, multinational enterprise customers, whom Peregrine believes
require integrated and comprehensive solutions for both infrastructure
management and e-transaction management. The group is intended to leverage the
synergies between Peregrine's infrastructure management and e-market groups by
working with Peregrine's large alliance partners, including some of the world's
largest consultancy firms, managed service providers, and system integrators.
These partners serve as important and persuasive "influencers" for large
enterprises considering technology purchases, and the integrated solutions group
was created to continue to create and improve relationships with these partners.
The integrated solutions group has two primary responsibilities within
Peregrine's organization. The first mission of the integrated solutions group
will be to market and sell Peregrine's comprehensive product portfolio to
Peregrine's large enterprise customers and strategic partners in a manner that
is most efficient for both Peregrine and its largest customers. The group's
second objective is to sponsor and evolve new business areas through an internal
incubator process. An example of one such incubator activity currently managed
by the integrated solutions group is Peregrine's recent introduction of REAL
ESTATE PORTFOLIO MANAGER, a web-based technology offered primarily as a hosted
solution to large real estate owners, operators, leasing companies, and lessors
to reduce the frictional costs associated with managing a host of complex tasks
involved in getting the most out of a corporate real estate investment.

    Peregrine was incorporated in California in 1981 and reincorporated in
Delaware in 1994. Peregrine's principal executive offices are located at 3611
Valley Centre Drive, San Diego, California 92130. Peregrine's telephone number
at that address is (858) 481-5000.

                               BUSINESS OF REMEDY

    Remedy develops, markets and supports highly adaptable enterprise software
solutions. Its solutions are focused on automating frequently changing,
employee-intensive, everyday business processes. Remedy has two solutions
families: information technology service management solutions and customer
relationship management solutions. Information technology service management
solutions such as REMEDY HELP DESK, REMEDY SERVICE LEVEL AGREEMENTS, REMEDY
ASSET MANAGEMENT and REMEDY CHANGE MANAGEMENT manage and streamline the business
processes for serving and supporting internal corporate customers and for
managing the full life-cycle of assets. Customer relationship management
solutions such as REMEDY CUSTOMER SUPPORT, REMEDY QUALITY MANAGEMENT, REMEDY
LEADS MANAGEMENT and REMEDY SALES CONTINUUM manage external customer
relationships including the management of customer support. Important product
attributes of both solutions families include flexible integration capabilities
in a packaged solution, speed of implementation, ease of use, rapid return on
investment, and on-going adaptability.

    Remedy's software is designed to integrate, generally without programming,
with a wide variety of computer and telecommunication technologies and products,
including desktop applications, enterprise resource planning applications,
telephony devices, hand-held devices, network management systems and legacy
systems. Remedy provides a highly scalable, ready-to-deploy foundation and
solutions that are easy to change. The majority of customer installations take
place in less than 90 days. Customers use the solutions as is, out-of-the-box,
or point-and-click to easily tailor them to specific company requirements. The
concept is similar to spreadsheet software, which can be used as a simple
tabular calculating platform or can be modified to include sophisticated
formulas and style changes to create unique solutions. More importantly,
Remedy's solutions are adaptable to meet most future requirements and growth
without costly programming.

    Each of Remedy's solutions is built upon its core product solution
foundation. The primary core product is the ACTION REQUEST SYSTEM, a flexible
foundation for automating complex business processes throughout the enterprise.
Built for adaptability in a continuously changing business environment, the
ACTION REQUEST SYSTEM allows for rapid prototyping and affordable applications.
The ACTION REQUEST SYSTEM, which can be deployed locally or over the Web,
reduces the cost of automating many internal business processes by using simple
point-and-click methods to adapt the solution's workflow and tracking capability
to the unique information, process and integration requirements of the
customer's department or enterprise.

    Remedy markets its software and services through a regionally based direct
sales force, a direct telesales force and through indirect sales channels,
including value-added resellers, system integrators and independent software
vendors. It has sales professionals in 12 offices throughout North America.
Outside of North America, Remedy sells its products primarily through indirect
sales channels and direct sales professionals in 13 offices.

    Remedy complements its products with a professional services organization
that provides customers with consulting, education and customer support
services. It believes that providing a high level of customer service and
technical support is critical to customer satisfaction and loyalty. The
organization also trains the Remedy partner community for the delivery of these
services.

    Remedy was incorporated on November 20, 1990 in Delaware and shipped the
first version of the ACTION REQUEST SYSTEM in December of 1991. In 1998 and
1999, Remedy began providing out-of-the-box customer relationship management and
information technology service management solutions that sit on top of the
ACTION REQUEST SYSTEM. Since then, Remedy has created more out-of-the-box
solutions in these areas and is continuing a proliferation strategy to existing
customers as well as introducing the solutions to new customers.

    Remedy maintains its executive offices and principal facilities at 1585
Charleston Road, Mountain View, California 94043. Its telephone number is
(650) 903-5200.

      NOTES TO UNAUDITED PRO FORMA COMBINED CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

1.  BASIS OF PRESENTATION

    The unaudited pro forma combined condensed financial statements of Peregrine
have been prepared based on the historical consolidated financial statements of
Peregrine and Remedy for the year ended March 31, 2001 considering the effects
of the merger under the purchase method. The unaudited pro forma combined
condensed balance sheet of Peregrine at March 31, 2001 has been prepared as if
the merger had been consummated at March 31, 2001. The unaudited pro forma
combined condensed statement of operations for the year ended March 31, 2001 has
been prepared as if the merger had been consummated on April 1, 2000.

    In management's opinion, all material adjustments necessary to reflect the
effects of the merger have been made. The unaudited pro forma combined condensed
financial statements are not necessarily indicative of the actual financial
position at March 31, 2001, or what the actual results of operations of
Peregrine would have been assuming the merger had been completed as of April 1,
2000, nor are they indicative of the financial position or results of operations
for future periods. The unaudited pro forma combined condensed financial
statements should be read in conjunction with the historical consolidated
financial statements and notes thereto of Peregrine and Remedy incorporated by
reference herein.

2.  PRO FORMA ADJUSTMENTS AND ASSUMPTIONS

    (A) Remedy's consolidated financial statements have been adjusted to conform
to Peregrine's basis of presentation.

    (B) The purchase price for the completion of the Remedy merger was
determined by combining: $274.5 million in cash (approximately 30.5 million
Remedy common shares at $9.00 per share), the value of Peregrine common stock
issued to Remedy stockholders (approximately 28 million Peregrine common shares
valued at $28.12 per share, based on the weighted share price a few days before
and after the announcement date of the merger); the estimated fair value of the
stock options assumed (including the estimated fair value of the accelerated
vesting of certain stock options assumed); and the estimated transactions costs
for the merger. The estimated direct transaction costs to be incurred by the
combined company include transaction fees for investment bankers, attorneys,
accountants, financial printing, due diligence costs, and other related charges.
The estimated preliminary purchase price for the completion of the merger is
summarized below (in thousands):

Cash........................................................  $  274,500
Common stock and additional paid-in capital.................  $  787,360
Estimated fair value of stock options assumed...............     176,963
Estimated transaction costs, involuntary termination,
  relocation, and other merger related costs................      60,000
                                                              ----------
                                                              $1,298,823
                                                              ==========

    The estimated preliminary allocation of the purchase price for the
completion of the Remedy merger was determined as follows, pending completion of
a detailed valuation of the assets acquired (in thousands):

Fair value of net assets acquired (net of impact of note I
  adjustments)..............................................  $  208,557
Deferred compensation.......................................      24,660
Acquired in-process technology..............................      80,000
Other intangible assets (See note C below)..................     175,000
Goodwill....................................................     810,606
                                                              ----------
                                                              $1,298,823
                                                              ==========

    The components of the pro forma adjustment to goodwill are as follows (in
thousands):

Goodwill (see above) resulting from this transaction........  $810,606
Less: Remedy goodwill.......................................   (26,115)
                                                              --------
      Net adjustment........................................  $784,491
                                                              ========

    (C) Other intangible assets related to the Remedy merger consist of acquired
developed technology and acquired customer base of approximately $50 million and
$125 million, respectively. This estimated preliminary allocation is pending
completion of a detailed valuation of the assets acquired. The unaudited pro
forma combined condensed statements of operations do not reflect the
amortization of acquired goodwill or acquired customer base, consistent with the
Financial Accounting Standards Board Proposed Statement "Business Combinations
and Intangible Assets." The acquired developed technology will be amortized on a
straight-line basis over three years and has been included in the pro forma
combined condensed company's statement of operations.

    (D) Elimination of Remedy stockholders' equity amounts. The components of
the pro forma adjustment to retained earnings (deficit) are as follows (in
thousands):

Elimination of Remedy retained earnings.....................  $131,642
One time charge associated with acquired in-process
  technology (see note B)...................................    80,000
                                                              --------
Net adjustment..............................................  $211,642
                                                              ========

                     DESCRIPTION OF PEREGRINE CAPITAL STOCK

GENERAL

    Peregrine is authorized to issue 500,000,000 shares of common stock, $0.001
par value, and 5,000,000 shares of undesignated preferred stock, $0.001 par
value. As of July 9, 2001, approximately 163,144,479 shares of Peregrine common
stock were outstanding, 25,811,449 shares of Peregrine common stock were
issuable upon exercise of outstanding options, and no shares of Peregrine
preferred stock were issued and outstanding.

    The following description of Peregrine's capital stock does not purport to
be complete and is subject to and qualified in its entirety by Peregrine's
amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws and by the
provisions of applicable Delaware law.

    The amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain
certain provisions that are intended to enhance the likelihood of continuity and
stability in the composition of Peregrine's board of directors and which may
have the effect of delaying, deferring, or preventing a future takeover or
change in control of Peregrine unless such takeover or change in control is
approved by Peregrine's board of directors.

COMMON STOCK

    Holders of Peregrine common stock are entitled to one vote per share on all
matters to be voted upon by the stockholders. Holders of Peregrine common stock
do not have cumulative voting rights, and, therefore, holders of a majority of
the shares voting for the election of directors can elect all of the directors.
In such event, the holders of the remaining shares will not be able to elect any
directors.

    Holders of Peregrine common stock are entitled to receive such dividends as
may be declared from time to time by Peregrine's board of directors out of funds
legally available therefor, subject to the terms of any existing or future
agreements between Peregrine and its debtholders. Peregrine has never declared
or paid cash dividends on its capital stock, expects to retain future earnings,
if any, for use in the operation and expansion of its business, and does not
anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future. In the event of
the liquidation, dissolution or winding up of Peregrine, the holders of
Peregrine common stock are entitled to share ratably in all assets legally
available for distribution after payment of all debts and other liabilities and
subject to the prior rights of any holders of Peregrine preferred stock then
outstanding.

PREFERRED STOCK

    Peregrine's board of directors has the authority to issue preferred stock in
one or more series and to fix the price, rights, preferences, privileges and
restrictions thereof, including dividend rights, dividend rates, conversion
rights, voting rights, terms of redemption, redemption prices, liquidation
preferences and the number of shares constituting a series or the designation of
such series, without any further vote or action by Peregrine's stockholders. The
issuance of preferred stock, while providing desirable flexibility in connection
with possible acquisitions and other corporate purposes, could have the effect
of delaying deferring or preventing a change in control of Peregrine without
further action by the stockholders and may adversely affect the market price of,
and the voting and the other rights of, the holders of Peregrine common stock.
The issuance of preferred stock with voting and conversion rights may adversely
affect the voting power of the holders of Peregrine common stock, including the
loss of voting control to others. Peregrine has no current plans to issue any
shares of Peregrine preferred stock.

ANTITAKEOVER EFFECTS OF PROVISIONS OF CERTIFICATE OF INCORPORATION AND BYLAWS

    Peregrine's amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that
all stockholder actions must be effected at a duly called annual or special
meeting and may not be effected by written consent. Peregrine's bylaws provide
that, except as otherwise required by law, special meetings of the stockholders
can only be called by Peregrine's board of directors, the chairman of
Peregrine's board of directors, the chief executive officer of Peregrine or
stockholders holding shares in the aggregate entitled to cast not less than 10%
of the votes at such meeting. In addition, Peregrine's bylaws establish an
advance notice procedure for stockholder proposals to be brought before an
annual meeting of stockholders, including proposed nominations of persons for
election to Peregrine's board of directors. Stockholders at an annual meeting
may only consider proposals or nominations specified in the notice of meeting or
brought before the meeting by or at the direction of Peregrine's board of
directors or by a stockholder who was a stockholder of record on the record date
for the meeting, who is entitled to vote at the meeting and who has delivered
timely written notice in proper form to Peregrine's secretary of the
stockholder's intention to bring such business before the meeting.

    The foregoing provisions of Peregrine's amended and restated certificate of
incorporation and bylaws are intended to enhance the likelihood of continuity
and stability in the composition of Peregrine's board of directors and in the
policies formulated by Peregrine's board of directors and to discourage certain
types of transactions which may involve an actual or threatened change of
control of Peregrine. Such provisions are designed to reduce the vulnerability
of Peregrine to an unsolicited acquisition proposal and, accordingly, could
discourage potential acquisition proposals and could delay or prevent a change
in control of Peregrine. Such provisions are also intended to discourage certain
tactics that may be used in proxy fights but could, however, have the effect of
discouraging others from making tender offers for Peregrine's shares and,
consequently, may also inhibit fluctuations in the market price of Peregrine's
shares that could result from actual or rumored takeover attempts. These
provisions may also have the effect of preventing changes in the management of
Peregrine.

                      DESCRIPTION OF REMEDY CAPITAL STOCK

GENERAL

    Remedy is authorized to issue 240,000,000 shares of common stock, $.00005
par value, and 20,000,000 shares of preferred stock, $.00005 par value, of which
50,000 shares are designated as Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock.
As of July 9, 2001, approximately 30,909,043 shares of common stock were
outstanding, 9,580,747 shares of Remedy common stock were issuable upon exercise
of outstanding options and no shares of preferred stock were outstanding.

COMMON STOCK

    The holders of Remedy's common stock are entitled to one vote per share on
all matters to be voted upon by the stockholders. Subject to preferences that
may be applicable to any outstanding preferred stock, the common stockholders
are entitled to receive ratably any dividends declared from time to time by
Remedy's board of directors. In the event of the liquidation, dissolution or
winding up of Remedy, the holders of Remedy's common stock are entitled to share
equally in all assets remaining after payment of liabilities, subject to the
prior distribution rights of any Remedy preferred stock then outstanding.
Remedy's common stock has no preemptive or conversion rights or other
subscription rights. There are no redemption or sinking fund provisions
applicable to the common stock. All outstanding shares of Remedy's common stock
are fully paid and nonassessable.

PREFERRED STOCK

    Remedy's board of directors has the authority to issue the undesignated
preferred stock in one or more series and to fix the rights, preferences,
privileges and restrictions granted to or imposed upon any unissued and
undesignated shares of Remedy's preferred stock and to fix the number of shares
constituting any series and the designations of any series, without any further
vote or action by the Remedy stockholders. The issuance of preferred stock may
have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a change in control of
Remedy without stockholder approval and may adversely affect the voting and
other rights of the holders of common stock. The issuance of preferred stock
with voting and conversion rights may adversely affect the voting power of the
holders of Remedy common stock, including the loss of voting control to others.
Remedy currently has no plans to issue any of the preferred stock.

ANTITAKEOVER EFFECTS OF PROVISIONS OF CERTIFICATE OF INCORPORATION AND BYLAWS

    Remedy's amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that all
stockholder actions must be effected at a duly called annual or special meeting
and may not be effected by written consent. Remedy's bylaws provide that, except
as otherwise required by law, special meetings of the stockholders can only be
called by Remedy's board of directors or the president of Remedy. Remedy's
stockholders have no ability to call a special meeting. In addition, Remedy's
bylaws establish an advance notice procedure for stockholder proposals to be
brought before an annual meeting of stockholders, including proposed nominations
of persons for election to Remedy's board of directors. Stockholders at an
annual or special meeting may only consider proposals or nominations specified
in the notice of meeting or brought before the meeting by or at the direction of
Remedy's board of directors or by a stockholder who was a stockholder of record
on the record date for the meeting, who is entitled to vote at the meeting and
who has delivered timely written notice in proper form to Remedy's secretary of
the stockholder's intention to bring such business before the meeting.

    The foregoing provisions of Remedy's amended and restated certificate of
incorporation and bylaws are intended to enhance the likelihood of continuity
and stability in the composition of Remedy's board of directors and in the
policies formulated by Remedy's board of directors and to discourage certain
types of transactions which may involve an actual or threatened change of
control of

Remedy. Such provisions are designed to reduce the vulnerability of Remedy to an
unsolicited acquisition proposal and, accordingly, could discourage potential
acquisition proposals and could delay or prevent a change in control of Remedy.
Such provisions are also intended to discourage certain tactics that may be used
in proxy fights but could, however, have the effect of discouraging others from
making tender offers for Remedy's shares and, consequently, may also inhibit
fluctuations in the market price of Remedy's shares that could result from
actual or rumored takeover attempts. These provisions may also have the effect
of preventing changes in the management of Remedy.

    RIGHTS AGREEMENT

    On July 25, 1997, Remedy adopted a rights agreement covering each share of
Remedy's common stock outstanding as of August 29, 1997 and each share of common
stock issued after August 29, 1997. When exercisable, each right initially
entitles the holder to purchase one one-thousandth of a share of Remedy
Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock, par value $0.00005 per share, at
a price of $230.00 per one one-thousandth of a preferred share, subject to
adjustment.

    The rights under Remedy's rights agreement become exercisable on the earlier
of: (a) 10 days following a public announcement that a person or group of
affiliated or associated persons has become an ACQUIRING PERSON or (b) 10
business days (or such later date as may be determined by Remedy's board of
directors) following the commencement or announcement of a tender offer or
exchange offer that would result in a person or group of affiliated or
associated persons becoming an ACQUIRING PERSON.

    An ACQUIRING PERSON is a person or group of affiliated or associated persons
who acquire beneficial ownership of 20% or more of the outstanding Remedy common
stock.

    If a person or group of affiliated or associated persons becomes an
ACQUIRING PERSON, each holder of a right, other than rights beneficially owned
by the ACQUIRING PERSON (which will become void), will have the right to receive
upon exercise of a right a number of shares of Remedy's common stock with a
market value equal to two times the exercise price of the right. A similar
adjustment will occur if, after a person or group of affiliated or associated
persons becomes an ACQUIRING PERSON, Remedy is acquired in a merger or other
business combination transaction or 50% or more of Remedy's assets or earning
power are sold.

    Remedy's rights agreement was designed to protect and maximize the value of
Remedy's outstanding equity interests in the event of an unsolicited acquisition
proposal for the company on terms and conditions not approved by Remedy's board
of directors. Under the terms of the merger agreement, Remedy has amended the
rights agreement to ensure that the merger agreement and the consummation of the
merger will not result in Peregrine being deemed an ACQUIRING PERSON or
otherwise triggering an exercise of the rights or the rights agreement. In
addition, Remedy has amended the rights agreement to exempt Peregrine from
becoming an Acquiring Person or otherwise triggering the exercise of the rights
for 6 months from any termination of the merger agreement, other then a
termination by Remedy because of an unremedied breach of the merger agreement by
Peregrine.

                             OF REMEDY COMMON STOCK
                           AND PEREGRINE COMMON STOCK

    THIS SECTION OF THE PROXY STATEMENT/PROSPECTUS DESCRIBES CERTAIN DIFFERENCES
BETWEEN REMEDY COMMON STOCK AND PEREGRINE COMMON STOCK. WHILE PEREGRINE AND
REMEDY BELIEVE THAT THE DESCRIPTION COVERS THE MATERIAL DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE
TWO, IT MAY NOT CONTAIN ALL OF THE INFORMATION THAT IS IMPORTANT TO REMEDY
STOCKHOLDERS, INCLUDING THE CERTIFICATE OF INCORPORATION AND BYLAWS OF PEREGRINE
AND THE CERTIFICATE OF INCORPORATION AND BYLAWS OF REMEDY. REMEDY STOCKHOLDERS
SHOULD READ THIS ENTIRE DOCUMENT AND THE OTHER DOCUMENTS REFERRED TO CAREFULLY
FOR A MORE COMPLETE UNDERSTANDING OF THE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN REMEDY COMMON STOCK
AND PEREGRINE COMMON STOCK.

    After completion of the merger, Remedy stockholders will become stockholders
of Peregrine. The rights of Remedy stockholders are presently governed by
Delaware corporation law, a rights agreement and by Remedy's certificate of
incorporation and bylaws. When stockholders of Remedy become stockholders of
Peregrine, their rights will be governed by Delaware corporation law and by
Peregrine's certificate of incorporation and bylaws. The following discussion
compares the material provisions in Remedy's certificate of incorporation and
bylaws with the provisions in Peregrine's certificate of incorporation and
bylaws. See "Description of Remedy Capital Stock" beginning on page 98 for a
description of the rights of Remedy stockholders under Remedy's rights agreement
with respect to antitakeover measures.

                                APPRAISAL RIGHTS

    Under the Delaware General Corporation Law, Remedy stockholders may object
to the merger and demand in writing that the company surviving the merger pay
the fair value of their shares. Determination of fair value is based on all
relevant factors, but excludes any appreciation or depreciation resulting from
the anticipation or accomplishment of the merger. Stockholders who elect to
exercise appraisal rights must comply with all of the procedures to preserve
those rights. A copy of Section 262 of the Delaware General Corporation Law,
which sets forth the appraisal rights, is attached as Annex E to this document.

    Section 262 sets forth the procedures a stockholder requesting appraisal
must follow. These procedures are complicated and must be followed completely.
Failure to comply with these procedures may cause you to lose your appraisal
rights. The following information is only a summary of the required procedures
and is qualified in its entirety by the provisions of Section 262. Please review
Section 262 for the complete procedures. Neither Peregrine nor Remedy will give
you any notice of your appraisal rights other than as described in this document
and as required by the Delaware General Corporation Law.

GENERAL REQUIREMENTS

    Section 262 generally requires the following:

    - You must deliver a written demand for appraisal to Remedy before the vote
      is taken at the Remedy special meeting. This written demand for appraisal
      must be separate from the proxy. In other words, failure to return the
      proxy or returning the proxy with a notation on it will not alone
      constitute demand for appraisal. Similarly, a vote against the merger will
      not satisfy your obligation to make written demand for appraisal. You
      should read the paragraphs below and Appendix E for more details on making
      a demand for appraisal.

    - You must not vote in favor of approval and adoption of the merger
      agreement or approval of the merger. If you return a properly executed
      proxy or otherwise vote in favor of approval and adoption of the merger
      agreement or approval of the merger, you will lose your right to
      appraisal, even if you previously filed a written demand for appraisal.
      You do not have to vote against the merger in order to preserve your
      appraisal rights.

    - You must continuously hold your shares of Remedy stock from the date you
      make the demand for appraisal through the closing of the merger.

REQUIREMENTS FOR WRITTEN DEMAND FOR APPRAISAL

    A written demand for appraisal of Remedy stock is only effective if it is
signed by, or for, the stockholder of record who owns the shares at the time the
demand is made. The demand must be signed as the stockholder's name appears on
its stock certificate(s). If you are a beneficial owner of Remedy stock but not
a stockholder of record, you must have the stockholder of record for your shares
sign a demand for appraisal on your behalf.

    If you own Remedy stock in a fiduciary capacity, such as a trustee, guardian
or custodian, you must disclose the fact that you are signing the demand for
appraisal in that capacity.

    If you own Remedy stock with one or more other persons, such as in a joint
tenancy or tenancy in common, all of the owners must sign, or have signed for
them, the demand for appraisal. An authorized agent, which could include one or
more of the owners, may sign the demand for appraisal for a stockholder of
record; however, the agent must expressly disclose who the stockholder of record
is and that he or she is signing the demand as that stockholder's agent.

    If you are a record owner, such as a broker, who holds Remedy stock as a
nominee for others, you may exercise a right of appraisal with respect to the
shares held for one or more beneficial owners, while not exercising that right
for other beneficial owners. In such a case, you should specify in the written
demand the number of shares as to which you wish to demand appraisal. If you do
not specify the number of shares, it will be assumed that your written demand
covers all the shares of Remedy stock that are in your name.

    If you are a Remedy stockholder, you should address the written demand to
Remedy Corporation, 1585 Charleston Road, Mountain View, California 94043,
Attention: Secretary. It is important that Remedy receive all written demands
before the vote concerning the merger is taken. As explained above, this written
demand should be signed by, or on behalf of, the stockholder of record. The
written demand for appraisal should specify the stockholder's name and mailing
address, the number of shares of stock owned, and that the stockholder is
thereby demanding appraisal of such stockholder's shares.

WRITTEN NOTICE

    Within 10 days after the closing of the merger, the company surviving the
merger must give written notice of the date that the merger became effective to
each stockholder who has fully complied with the conditions of Section 262.
Except as required by law, you will not be notified of any dates by which
appraisal rights must be exercised.

PETITION WITH THE CHANCERY COURT

    Within 120 days after the closing of the merger, the company surviving the
merger or any stockholder who has complied with the conditions of Section 262
may file a petition in the Delaware Court of Chancery. This petition should
request that the Chancery Court determine the value of the shares of Remedy
stock held by all of the stockholders who are entitled to appraisal rights. If
you intend to exercise your rights of appraisal, you should file a petition in
the Chancery Court. Neither Remedy nor Peregrine have any intention at this time
to file a petition. Because neither Remedy nor Peregrine have an obligation to
file a petition, if you do not file such a petition within 120 days after the
closing, you will lose your rights of appraisal.

WITHDRAWAL OF DEMAND

    If you change your mind and decide you no longer want an appraisal, you may
withdraw your demand for appraisal at any time within 60 days after the closing
of the merger. You may also withdraw your demand for appraisal after 60 days
after the closing of the merger, but only with the written consent of Peregrine.
If you withdraw your demand for appraisal, you will receive the merger
consideration provided in the merger agreement.

REQUEST FOR APPRAISAL RIGHTS STATEMENT

    If you have complied with the conditions of Section 262, you will be
entitled to receive a statement setting forth the number of shares for which
appraisal rights have been exercised and the number of stockholders who own
those shares. In order to receive this statement, you must send a written
request to Peregrine within 120 days after the closing of the merger. After the
merger, Peregrine will have 10 days after receiving a request to mail the
statement to the stockholder.

CHANCERY COURT PROCEDURES

    If you properly file a petition for appraisal in the Chancery Court and
deliver a copy to Peregrine, Peregrine will then have 20 days to provide the
Chancery Court with a list of the names and addresses of all stockholders who
have demanded appraisal and have not reached an agreement with Peregrine as to
the value of their shares. If the Chancery Court decides it is appropriate, it
will then send notice to

all of the stockholders who have demanded appraisal. The Chancery Court has the
power to conduct a hearing to determine whether the stockholders have fully
complied with Section 262 of the Delaware General Corporation Law and whether
they are entitled to appraisal under that section. The Chancery Court may also
require you to submit your stock certificates to the Registry in Chancery so
that it can note on the certificates that an appraisal proceeding is pending. If
you do not follow the Chancery Court's directions, you may be dismissed from the
proceeding.

CHANCERY COURT APPRAISAL OF REMEDY SHARES

    After the Chancery Court determines which stockholders are entitled to
appraisal rights, the Chancery Court will appraise the shares of stock. To
determine the fair value of the shares, the Chancery Court will consider all
relevant factors except for any appreciation or depreciation resulting from the
anticipation or accomplishment of the merger. After the Chancery Court
determines the fair value of the shares, it will direct Peregrine to pay that
value to the stockholders who are entitled to appraisal. The Chancery Court can
also direct Peregrine to pay interest, simple or compound, on that value if the
Chancery Court determines that interest is appropriate. In order to receive the
fair value for your shares, you must surrender your stock certificates to
Peregrine.

    The Chancery Court could determine that the fair value of shares of Remedy
stock is more than, the same as, or less than the merger consideration. In other
words, if you demand appraisal rights, you could receive less consideration than
you would under the merger agreement.

COSTS AND EXPENSES OF APPRAISAL PROCEEDING

    The costs and expenses of the appraisal proceeding may be assessed against
the company surviving the merger and the stockholders participating in the
appraisal proceeding, as the Chancery Court deems equitable under the
circumstances. You can request that the Chancery Court determine the amount of
interest, if any, that the company surviving the merger should pay on the value
of stock owned by stockholders entitled to the payment of interest. You may also
request that the Chancery Court allocate the expenses of the appraisal action
incurred by any stockholder pro rata against the value of all of the shares
entitled to appraisal.

LOSS OF STOCKHOLDER'S RIGHTS

    If you demand appraisal, after the closing of the merger you will not be
entitled to:

    - vote your shares of stock, for any purpose, for which you have demanded
      appraisal;

    - receive payment of dividends or any other distribution with respect to
      your shares, except for dividends or distributions, if any, that are
      payable to holders of record as of a record date before the effective time
      of the merger; or

    - receive the payment of the consideration provided for in the merger
      agreement.

    However, you can regain these rights if no petition for an appraisal is
filed within 120 days after the closing of the merger, or if you deliver to
Peregrine a written withdrawal of your demand for an appraisal and your
acceptance of the merger, either within 60 days after the closing of the merger
or with the written consent of Peregrine. As explained above, these actions will
also terminate your appraisal rights. However, an appraisal proceeding in the
Chancery Court cannot be dismissed without the Chancery Court's approval. The
Chancery Court may condition its approval upon any terms that it deems just.

    IF YOU FAIL TO COMPLY STRICTLY WITH THESE PROCEDURES YOU WILL LOSE YOUR
APPRAISAL RIGHTS. CONSEQUENTLY, IF YOU WISH TO EXERCISE YOUR APPRAISAL RIGHTS,
YOU ARE STRONGLY URGED TO CONSULT A LEGAL ADVISOR BEFORE ATTEMPTING TO EXERCISE
YOUR APPRAISAL RIGHTS.
