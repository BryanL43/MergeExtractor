                  SUBJECT TO COMPLETION--DATED MARCH 14, 2001

Dear Potomac Electric Power Company and Conectiv Stockholders:

 The boards of directors of Conectiv and Potomac Electric Power Company (which
we refer to as Pepco) have agreed to a transaction among Pepco, New RC, Inc.
and Conectiv. New RC, Inc. was recently created as a direct wholly owned
subsidiary of Pepco, and after the completion of the transaction, as described
in the agreement and plan of merger between Pepco, Conectiv and New RC, Inc.
(which we refer to as the merger agreement), will be the parent of both Pepco
and Conectiv. After completion of the transaction, Pepco and Conectiv
stockholders will own the common stock of New RC, which will be renamed prior
to the completion of the transaction. In this joint proxy statement/prospectus,
New RC, Inc. is referred to as HoldCo.

 Under the terms of the merger agreement, holders of Pepco's common stock will
receive one share of HoldCo common stock for each share of Pepco common stock
that they own. Pepco's preferred stock will not be exchanged in the
transaction, and following the closing of the transaction will remain issued
and outstanding.

 The terms of the merger agreement provide that, for each share of Conectiv
common stock that they own, Conectiv stockholders will be able to elect to
receive either $25.00 ($21.69 for each share of Conectiv Class A common stock
which they own) in cash or a number of shares of HoldCo common stock designed
to provide Conectiv stockholders with HoldCo common stock having a value of
$25.00 ($21.69 for the Conectiv Class A common stock), subject to adjustment.
The actual value of any stock consideration may be more than or less than
$25.00 (more than or less than $21.69 for the Conectiv Class A common stock),
depending on the market price of Pepco common stock shortly before the
transaction closes. Holders of Conectiv common stock and Conectiv Class A
common stock may choose to exchange some or all of their shares for cash and
some or all of their shares for HoldCo common stock; however the right of
Conectiv's stockholders to elect to receive cash or stock is subject to
proration if the elections exceed 50% in cash or 50% in stock.

 Although the exact exchange ratio and value of the HoldCo common stock that
the Conectiv stockholders will receive in the transaction will not be
determined until after the stockholders of Pepco and Conectiv have voted and
shortly before the date that the transaction is completed, we estimate that
Conectiv stockholders will own approximately 33% and Pepco stockholders will
own approximately 67% of the outstanding HoldCo common stock immediately after
the transaction. The common stock of HoldCo will be listed on the New York
Stock Exchange (which we refer to as the NYSE) under the symbol " ".

 The stockholders of Pepco and Conectiv must approve the merger agreement for
the transaction to be completed. The approval of the stockholders of Pepco and
Conectiv is also being sought for the new Long-Term Incentive Plan that HoldCo
intends to put in place following the closing of the transaction. At their
respective annual meetings, Pepco common stockholders will also be asked to
elect three directors to serve for three years, one director to serve for two
years and one director to serve for one year, and Conectiv stockholders will
also be asked to elect three directors to serve for three years or until their
earlier resignation or removal. Whether or not you plan to attend your meeting,
please take the time to vote by completing and mailing the enclosed proxy card
or, if you are a Conectiv stockholder, granting a proxy by telephone or the
Internet in accordance with the instructions on the enclosed proxy card.

 Only stockholders of record of Pepco at the close of business on      , 2001
and stockholders of record of Conectiv at the close of business on      , 2001
are entitled to attend or vote at the respective meetings. The dates, times and
places of the meetings are:

     For Pepco stockholders:  For Conectiv stockholders:
          , 2001 at   a.m.         , 2001 at   a.m.

Q: When and where will the Pepco meeting be held?

A: The Pepco meeting will be held at 10:00 a.m. on     ,     , 2001, at
            . Admission to the meeting will be limited to Pepco stockholders or
   their authorized proxies. Admission tickets are not required.

Q: What are Pepco stockholders being asked to vote on?

A: Pepco's common stockholders are being asked to vote on the merger agreement
   among Pepco, Conectiv and HoldCo; the HoldCo Long-Term Incentive Plan; the
   election to the Pepco Board of three directors for three-year terms, one
   director for a two-year term and one director for a one-year term and a
   stockholder proposal relating to the election of directors.

  Pepco's preferred stockholders are being asked to vote on the merger
  agreement between Pepco, Conectiv and HoldCo.

Q: How does the Pepco Board recommend I vote on the proposals?

A: The Pepco Board recommends that you vote "FOR" each proposal other than the
   stockholder proposal relating to the election of directors, on which you are
   recommended to vote "AGAINST."

Q: How do I vote?

A: Pepco stockholders may vote in person at the meeting or by returning a
   completed proxy card(s) in the enclosed postage-paid envelope. Your signed
   proxy card(s) will be voted in accordance with your instructions on your
   proxy card(s), or if you return your signed proxy card(s) but do not mark
   the boxes showing how you wish to vote, your shares will be voted "FOR" each
   proposal other than the stockholder proposal and "AGAINST" the stockholder
   proposal. If your shares are held in the name of a bank or broker, you will
   be able to grant voting instructions by telephone or on
   the Internet by following the directions on the proxy form you receive from
   your bank or broker.

Q: What shares are included on the enclosed proxy card for Pepco?

A: The number of shares indicated on the enclosed white proxy card consists of
   the number of shares of Pepco common stock that, as of the close of business
   on      , 2001 (which we refer to as the Pepco Record Date), you held of
   record and, if you are a participant in the Potomac Electric Power Company
   Dividend Reinvestment Plan, the number of shares held for your account under
   that plan. The number of shares indicated on the enclosed yellow proxy card
   consists of the total number of shares of preferred stock that, as of the
   Pepco Record Date, you held of record in all series of preferred stock. If
   you do not execute and return the proxy card(s), your shares will not be
   voted unless you attend the meeting and vote in person.

Q: What does it mean if I get more than one proxy card for the Pepco meeting?

A: You will receive one proxy card for each way in which your common and/or
   preferred shares are registered. If you receive more than one proxy card
   (other than because you both hold shares of record and are a participant in
   Pepco's 401(k) savings plan), it is because your shares are registered in
   different names or with different addresses or are held in different
   accounts. Please sign and return each proxy card that you receive to ensure
   that all your shares are voted. To enable us to provide better stockholder
   service, we encourage stockholders to have all their shares registered in
   the same name with the same address.

Q: How is stock in Pepco 401(k) plans for employees voted?

A: If you are an employee or former employee of Pepco who is a participant in
   Pepco's 401(k) savings plan, you will receive a proxy card

   indicating the number of shares held for your account under the savings
   plan. If you do not vote these shares, Fidelity Management Trust Company,
   the trustee for the plan, will vote the shares in your account in proportion
   to the vote of all of the 401(k) participants who vote their shares.

Q: Can I change my vote after I have returned my proxy card?

A: You may revoke your proxy by sending a written statement to that effect to
   the Corporate Secretary of Pepco before your proxy is voted; submitting a
   properly signed proxy with a later date; or by voting in person at the Pepco
   meeting.

Q: My shares of Pepco stock are held in "street name." Will my broker vote my
   shares at the Pepco meeting?

A: Under NYSE rules, a broker is permitted to vote your shares on the merger
   agreement and on the HoldCo Long-Term Incentive Plan only if you provide the
   broker with instructions on how to vote.

   On the other hand, a broker is permitted to vote your shares on the election
   of directors and the stockholder proposal whether or not you provide voting
   instructions to the broker. You should follow the directions provided by
   your broker(s) regarding how to provide voting instructions for your shares
   held in street name.

Q: Should I send in my Pepco common stock certificates now?

A: No. All common stockholders of Pepco will receive instructions at a later
   time as to how and when to send in their stock certificates.

Q: How can I get more information about Pepco?

   meeting?

A: Conectiv has mailed this material to all stockholders of record as of the
   Conectiv Record Date. In most cases, you will receive one proxy card for
   all shares registered in the same name. If you receive more than one proxy
   card (other than because you are a participant in the Conectiv Savings and

   agreement and the HoldCo Long-Term Incentive Plan only if you provide the
   broker with instructions on how to vote.

   broker. You should follow the directions provided by your broker(s)
   regarding how to provide voting instructions for your shares held in street
   name.

Q: Should I send in my stock certificates now?

   This summary highlights selected information from this joint proxy
statement/prospectus. It does not contain all of the detailed information that
may be important to you. To understand the transaction fully and for a more
complete description of the legal terms of the transaction, you should read
carefully this entire joint proxy statement/prospectus and the other documents
to which we refer. For more information about Pepco, Conectiv and HoldCo, see
"Where You Can Find More Information" on page 156. Each item in this summary
refers to the pages where that subject is discussed more fully.

The Companies

 Pepco (page 104)

Potomac Electric Power Company
1900 Pennsylvania Avenue, N.W.
Washington, D.C. 20068

   Pepco is engaged in three principal lines of business: (1) the provision of
regulated electric utility transmission and distribution services in the
Washington, D.C. metropolitan area, (2) the supply of telecommunications
services including local and long distance telephone, high-speed Internet and
cable television, and (3) the supply of energy products and services in
competitive retail markets.

 Conectiv (page 106)

Conectiv
800 King Street
Wilmington, DE 19899

   Conectiv is focused on two core energy businesses. Conectiv Power Delivery
provides safe, reliable, and affordable energy service to more than one million
customers in New Jersey, Delaware, Maryland, and Virginia. Conectiv Energy uses
a sophisticated power-trading unit to optimize the value of a growing portfolio
of "mid-merit" power plants that can start and stop quickly in response to
changes in the demand for power within the Pennsylvania-New Jersey-Maryland
(which we refer to as PJM) power pool.

The Transaction (page 27)

   The agreement and plan of merger is attached as Annex A to this joint proxy
statement/prospectus. It is the legal document that governs the mergers and
related transactions. We encourage you to read this document carefully. In this
joint proxy statement/prospectus, we refer to the agreement and plan of merger
as the merger agreement.

   The merger agreement provides for transactions by which Pepco and Conectiv
will become wholly owned subsidiaries of HoldCo. The merger agreement provides
that HoldCo, a newly formed wholly owned subsidiary of Pepco, will form two new
subsidiaries which will be wholly owned by HoldCo. At the effective time of the
transaction, one of the two new subsidiaries will be merged with and into
Pepco, with Pepco as the surviving corporation (which we refer to as the Pepco
Merger) and the other new subsidiary will be merged with and into Conectiv,
with Conectiv as the surviving corporation (which we refer to as the Conectiv
Merger, and, together

with the Pepco Merger, as the transaction).

What You will Receive (page 27)

   Pepco Stockholders. In the Pepco Merger, each share of Pepco common stock
held by the stockholders of Pepco at the effective time of the transaction will
automatically be exchanged into the right to receive one share of common stock
of HoldCo.

   If a Pepco common stockholder holds a fractional share of Pepco common stock
in the Pepco dividend reinvestment plan or through the Pepco 401(k) plan, that
fractional share will be converted into the right to receive an equivalent
fractional share of HoldCo common stock.

   Conectiv Stockholders. Each holder of Conectiv stock, subject to certain
restrictions described below, may elect to receive in exchange for each of his
or her shares of Conectiv stock, either:

 .   $25.00 per share in cash ($21.69 for each share of the Class A common
     stock); or

 .   a number of shares of HoldCo common stock determined by the exchange
     ratio described below, which is designed to provide Conectiv stockholders
     with HoldCo common stock having a market value of $25.00 ($21.69 for the
     Class A common stock).

Each holder of Conectiv stock may choose to exchange some or all of his or her
shares for cash and some or all of his or her shares for HoldCo common stock.
Conectiv stockholders will be asked to choose the form of consideration they
wish to receive through an election process occurring between one and two
months prior to the closing of the transaction. Pepco will allocate, at its
discretion, the form of merger consideration to be received by Conectiv
stockholders with respect to shares of Conectiv stock for which a proper and
timely election has not been made.

   The exchange ratio will be $25.00 divided by the volume-weighted average
(rounded to the nearest $0.0001) of the closing trading price per share of
Pepco common stock on the NYSE, as reported in The Wall Street Journal, Eastern
Edition, for the 20 trading days randomly selected by lot out of 30 consecutive
trading days ending on the fifth business day immediately preceding the closing
date of the transaction (which we refer to as the Average Final Price).

   If the Average Final Price is below $19.50, the number of shares of HoldCo
common stock that a Conectiv stockholder will have the right to receive for
each share of Conectiv common stock that he or she holds will be fixed at
1.28205 (1.11227 for the Class A common stock) and if Average Final Price is
above $24.50, the number of shares of HoldCo common stock received for each
share of Conectiv common stock will be fixed at 1.02041 (.88528 for the Class A
common stock). Therefore, if the Average Final Price is less than $19.50, then
each share of Conectiv common stock exchanged for stock consideration will
receive stock in the transaction with a value of less than $25.00 (less than
$21.69 for the Class A common stock), and if the Average Final Price is more
than $24.50, then each share of Conectiv common stock exchanged for stock
consideration will receive stock in the transaction with a value of more than
$25.00 (more than $21.69 for the Class A common stock). If the Average Final
Price is between $19.50 and $24.50, inclusive, then each share of Conectiv
common stock exchanged for stock consideration will receive stock in the
transaction with a value, at the time of the calculation of the Average Final
Price, of $25.00 ($21.69 for the Class A common stock). The actual value of
stock consideration received for each share of Conectiv stock will depend on
the Average Final Price and the market price of HoldCo common stock upon
completion of the transaction will not necessarily be the same as the Average
Final Price. The exchange ratio and the actual number of shares of HoldCo
common stock Conectiv stockholders will receive will not be determined until
after Conectiv stockholders vote on the transaction.

   Additionally, 50% of the consideration payable to Conectiv stockholders will
be paid in cash and 50% in HoldCo common stock. In the event that either cash
or stock is oversubscribed, the amount of each that a Conectiv stockholder will
have the right to receive upon exchange of his or her shares of Conectiv common
stock will be determined through an allocation and proration formula.

   After Conectiv stockholder elections have been tabulated, the elected
amounts of cash and HoldCo common stock will be subject to allocation and
proration to achieve a mix of aggregate exchange consideration to Conectiv
stockholders that is 50% cash and 50% HoldCo common stock.

   As a result, Conectiv stockholders may receive a different combination of
cash and HoldCo common stock than they elected. See "The Merger Agreement--
Procedures for Stockholder Elections" and "The Merger Agreement--Limits on Cash
and Stock Consideration and Allocation Rules" on pages 69 and70 .

Our Boards' Recommendations to Stockholders

   Pepco (page 38)

   The Pepco Board unanimously recommends that the stockholders of Pepco vote
"FOR" approval of the merger agreement and the related transactions and "FOR"
approval of the HoldCo Long-Term Incentive Plan.

   Conectiv (page 46)

   The Conectiv Board recommends that the stockholders of Conectiv vote "FOR"
approval of the merger agreement and the related transactions and "FOR"
approval of the HoldCo Long-Term Incentive Plan.

Opinions of the Financial Advisors

   Pepco (page 39)

   The Pepco Board has retained Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith
Incorporated (which we refer to as Merrill Lynch) as its financial advisor in
connection with the transaction and to assist the Pepco Board in evaluating the
financial terms of the transaction. On February 9, 2001, Merrill Lynch
delivered its oral opinion to the Pepco Board that, as of that date and based
on the assumptions made, matters considered and limitations reviewed with the
Pepco Board, the Pepco exchange ratio was fair from a financial point of view
to the holders of Pepco common stock, taking into account the Conectiv Merger,
and the consideration to be paid by Pepco in connection with the Conectiv
Merger was fair from a financial point of view to Pepco. Merrill Lynch
subsequently confirmed its oral opinion by delivery of its written opinion
dated February 9, 2001. The Merrill Lynch opinion is for the use and benefit of
the Pepco Board and does not constitute a recommendation to any stockholder as

   Conectiv (page 48)

   In connection with the Conectiv Merger, Conectiv's financial advisor, Credit
Suisse First Boston Corporation (which we refer to as Credit Suisse First
Boston), delivered a written opinion to the Conectiv

Board as to the fairness, from a financial point of view, to the holders of
Conectiv common stock of the Conectiv common stock consideration and to the
holders of Conectiv Class A common stock of the Conectiv Class A common stock
consideration.

   The full text of Credit Suisse First Boston's written opinion, dated
February 9, 2001, is attached to this document as Annex E. We encourage you to
read this opinion carefully in its entirety for a description of the procedures
followed, assumptions made, matters considered and limitations on the review
undertaken. Credit Suisse First Boston's opinion is addressed to the Conectiv
Board and does not constitute a recommendation to any stockholder as to any
matter relating to the transaction.

Dissenters' Appraisal Rights (page 54)

   The stockholders of Pepco have dissenters' appraisal rights under District
of Columbia and Virginia laws. The stockholders of Conectiv have dissenters'
appraisal rights under Delaware law. These rights are more fully described in
"The Transaction--Dissenters' Appraisal Rights." In view of the complexity of
these provisions of the District of Columbia, Virginia and Delaware corporate
law, any Pepco or Conectiv stockholder who is considering exercising
dissenters' appraisal rights may wish to consult a legal advisor.

Regulatory Approvals Required to Complete the Transaction (page 65)

   In order to complete the transaction, we must receive approvals from and/or
make filings with various U.S. federal and state governmental agencies. We
currently believe that the necessary approvals can be obtained by the first
quarter of 2002. At the federal level, these include clearance by the Federal
Trade Commission and the Department of Justice and approval of the Securities
and Exchange Commission (which we refer to as the SEC), the Federal Energy
Regulatory Commission, the Federal Communications Commission and, possibly, the
Nuclear Regulatory Commission. At the state level, approval is required from
the Delaware Public Service Commission, the Maryland Public Service Commission,
the New Jersey Board of Public Utilities, the Pennsylvania Public Utility
Commission and the Virginia State Corporation Commission. We do not believe
that the District of Columbia Public Service Commission (which we refer to as
the DC Commission) has direct jurisdiction over the transaction. However, Pepco
intends to work constructively with the DC Commission regarding the transaction
as well as its ongoing jurisdiction over Pepco following the transaction, and
make any filings with the DC Commission as are deemed appropriate.

   Further, after completion of the transaction HoldCo expects to register with
the SEC as a public utility holding company under the Public Utility Holding
Company Act of 1935 (which we refer to as the 1935 Act) and, consequently,
HoldCo will be subject to a number of restrictions under the 1935 Act.

Conditions to the Transaction (page 79)

   The transaction will not be completed unless customary conditions are
satisfied or waived by Pepco and Conectiv, including:

  .   stockholder approval;

  .   receipt of regulatory approvals under specified conditions;

  .   the absence of governmental action to block the transaction;

  .   listing of HoldCo shares on the NYSE;

  .   accuracy of the representations and warranties in the merger agreement;

  .   performance of all material agreements in the merger agreement;

  .   the receipt of tax opinions; and

  .   absence of a material adverse effect on either company.

Termination (page 80)

   Pepco and Conectiv each have the right to terminate the merger agreement:

  .   by mutual written consent;

  .   if the transaction has not been completed by August 9, 2002 or, if all
      closing conditions have been satisfied by August 9, 2002 other than the
      receipt of required statutory approvals, by February 9, 2003;

  .   if any governmental entity prohibits the transaction;

  .   if the stockholders of Pepco or Conectiv do not adopt or approve the
      merger agreement; or

  .   if the other company materially violates any of its representations,
      warranties or covenants under the merger agreement and that violation
      has not been corrected as permitted by the merger agreement.

   In addition, Pepco has the right to terminate the merger agreement if the
Conectiv Board withdraws, or modifies in any manner adverse to Pepco, its
approval of the merger agreement, approves or recommends another acquisition
proposal or resolves to take any of those actions.

   In addition, Conectiv has the right to terminate the merger agreement under
the following circumstances:

  .   if the Conectiv Board approves a superior acquisition proposal; as long
      as Conectiv first provides Pepco with a reasonable opportunity to make
      adjustments in the terms and conditions of the merger agreement
      sufficient to cause the Conectiv Board to determine that the proposal
      no longer constitutes a superior acquisition proposal;

  .   if the Pepco Board withdraws or modifies in any manner adverse to
      Conectiv, its approval of the merger agreement or resolves to take any
      of those actions; or

  .   if the Average Final Price is less than $16.50, subject to Pepco's
      right to supplement or "top-up" the value of the stock portion of the
      merger consideration, using either cash and/or additional HoldCo common
      stock, to a value of $21.15 per share of Conectiv common stock (and
      $18.35 per share of Conectiv Class A common stock). See "The
      Transaction--Conectiv "Walk-Away' Right and Pepco "Top-Up' Right" on
      page 31.

   With respect to the termination right described in the bullet point directly
above, the merger agreement does not provide for a resolicitation of Conectiv
stockholders in the event that the Average Final Price is less than $16.50 and
Conectiv nevertheless chooses to complete the transaction. Therefore, adoption
of the merger agreement by the Conectiv stockholders at the Conectiv annual
meeting will give the Conectiv Board the power, to be exercised in accordance
with its fiduciary duties, to complete the transaction even if the Average
Final Price is less than $16.50 without any further action by, or
resolicitation of, the Conectiv stockholders.

Termination Fee (page 81)

   A termination fee must be paid by either Conectiv or Pepco in the following
circumstances:

  .   If Conectiv terminates the merger agreement due to the Conectiv Board's
      approval of a superior acquisition proposal, Conectiv will be obligated
      to pay a termination fee of $60 million to Pepco.

  .   If Conectiv or Pepco terminates the merger agreement due to the failure
      of Conectiv's stockholders to adopt the merger agreement, and if at any
      time after February 9, 2001 and at or before the time of the Conectiv
      stockholders' meeting a bona fide acquisition proposal has been made
      public and has not been withdrawn and, within 12 months of the
      termination of the merger agreement, Conectiv enters into a definitive
      agreement with a third party with respect to an acquisition proposal
      (which is subsequently consummated) or an acquisition proposal is
      consummated, then Conectiv will be obligated to pay a termination fee
      of $60 million to Pepco.

  .   If Pepco terminates the merger agreement as a result of the Conectiv
      Board's withdrawing or modifying its approval of the merger agreement
      and the transaction, approving or recommending another acquisition
      proposal, or resolving to do any of those things, so long as this
      action by the Conectiv Board giving rise to Pepco's termination right
      was not caused by Pepco entering into a definitive agreement with
      respect to a merger, recapitalization, business combination, sale of
      substantially all of the assets or similar transaction involving Pepco
      (which we refer to as a Pepco Transaction) that could reasonably be
      expected to materially delay or impede the consummation of the
      transaction, then Conectiv will be obligated to pay a termination fee
      of $60 million to Pepco.

  .   If Conectiv or Pepco terminates the merger agreement due to the failure
      of Pepco's stockholders to adopt the merger agreement and at or before
      the time of the Pepco stockholders' meeting a bona fide proposal with
      respect to a Pepco Transaction has been made public and not withdrawn
      and, within 12 months of the termination of merger agreement, Pepco
      enters into a definitive agreement with a third party with respect to a
      Pepco Transaction (which is subsequently consummated) or a Pepco
      Transaction is consummated, then Pepco will be obligated to pay a
      termination fee of $60 million to Conectiv.

  .   If Conectiv terminates the merger agreement as a result of the Pepco
      Board's withdrawing or modifying its approval of the merger agreement
      and the transaction, or resolving to do any of those things, then Pepco
      will be obligated to pay a termination fee of $60 million to Conectiv.

Management and Operations Following the Transaction (page 108)

   Pepco and Conectiv agreed in the merger agreement that, at the effective
time of the transaction, the board of directors of HoldCo (which we refer to as
the HoldCo Board) will consist of 12 persons, at least two of whom will come
from the current Conectiv Board. At the effective time, it is expected that
John M. Derrick, Jr., chairman and chief executive officer of Pepco, will be
chairman and chief executive officer of HoldCo.

   At the effective time of the transaction, HoldCo will operate from and have
its headquarters in Washington, D.C.; Pepco will continue its operations from
its headquarters in Washington D.C. substantially as currently operated; and
Conectiv will continue to maintain its headquarters in Wilmington, Delaware and
will continue to have significant operations in New Jersey and on the Delmarva
Peninsula.

Dividends (page 108)

   HoldCo will adopt Pepco's dividend policy. The annual dividend at the
effective time is expected to be $1.00 per share of HoldCo common stock.
However, no assurance can be given that such dividend rate will be in effect or
will remain unchanged, and HoldCo reserves the right to increase or decrease
the dividend on HoldCo common stock as may be required by law or contract or as
may be determined by the HoldCo Board, in its discretion, as advisable.

Important Federal Income Tax Consequences (page 59)

  The U.S. federal income tax consequences to you will depend on the form of
consideration you receive in the transaction.

   If you are a U.S. Holder of Pepco common stock you will not recognize gain
or loss on the receipt of HoldCo common stock in the Pepco Merger.

   If you are a U.S. Holder of Conectiv stock and you receive solely HoldCo
common stock pursuant to the Conectiv Merger you will not recognize gain or
loss (except with respect to cash received instead of a fractional share of
HoldCo common stock). If you are a U.S. Holder of Conectiv stock and you
receive solely cash pursuant to the Conectiv Merger you will recognize gain or
a loss in an amount equal to the difference between the amount of cash received
and your adjusted tax basis in those shares of Conectiv stock. If you are a
U.S. Holder of Conectiv stock and you receive a combination of cash and HoldCo
common stock pursuant to the Conectiv Merger you will recognize gain (but not
loss) equal to the difference between
  .  the sum of the cash (excluding any cash received instead of fractional
     shares) and the fair market value of the HoldCo common stock received
     (including any fractional shares deemed received and exchanged for
     cash), and
  .  your adjusted tax basis in those shares of Conectiv stock,
but not in excess of the amount of cash received.

Accounting Treatment (page 59)

   The transaction will be accounted for by HoldCo as an acquisition of
Conectiv by Pepco using the purchase method of accounting for a business
combination in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Under
this method of accounting, the assets and liabilities of Conectiv will be
recorded at their fair values and, if necessary, any excess of the merger
consideration over those amounts will be recorded as goodwill. The results of
operations and cash flows of Conectiv will be included in HoldCo's financial
statements prospectively as of the effective time of the transaction.

Interests of Certain Persons in the Transaction (page 63)

   In considering the recommendation of your company's board of directors that
you vote for the merger agreement, you should be aware that certain of your
company's directors and officers may be deemed to have interests in the
transaction that are or may be different from, or in addition to, their
interests as stockholders.

Approval of the Long-Term Incentive Plan (page 83)

   In connection with the transaction, the HoldCo Board has adopted the HoldCo
Long-Term Incentive Plan. The objective of the HoldCo Long-Term Incentive Plan
is to increase stockholder value by providing a long-term incentive to reward
officers, key employees, and directors of HoldCo and its subsidiaries for the
profitable performance of HoldCo and its subsidiaries, and to increase the
ownership of HoldCo common stock by such individuals. The HoldCo Long-Term
Incentive Plan is being submitted for approval to the stockholders of both
Pepco and Conectiv. If the transaction is completed and the HoldCo Long-Term
Incentive Plan is approved by the stockholders of both Pepco and Conectiv, the
HoldCo Long-Term Incentive Plan will become effective on the closing date of
the transaction.

Comparison of Stockholder Rights (page 110)

   When the transaction is completed, both Pepco and Conectiv stockholders will
become stockholders of HoldCo and their rights will be governed by Delaware
law, the HoldCo certificate of incorporation and the HoldCo bylaws. There are
material differences between the rights of a Pepco stockholder under the Pepco
articles of incorporation, the Pepco bylaws and District of Columbia and
Virginia laws, or the rights of a Conectiv stockholder under the Conectiv
certificate of incorporation and the Conectiv bylaws and Delaware law, on the
one hand, and the rights of a holder of HoldCo common stock under the HoldCo
certificate of incorporation, the HoldCo bylaws and Delaware law, on the other
hand.

                    RISK FACTORS RELATING TO THE TRANSACTION

   In addition to the other information included and incorporated by reference
in this joint proxy statement/prospectus, you should carefully read and
consider the following factors in evaluating the proposals to be voted on at
your company's meeting.

   Although Conectiv stockholders will receive fixed value in terms of any cash
consideration that they receive in the transaction, we cannot assure Conectiv
stockholders of the value of any HoldCo common stock they receive in the
transaction.

   The cash price to be paid for shares of Conectiv common stock in the
transaction is fixed at $25.00 per share of Conectiv common stock and $21.69
per share of Conectiv Class A common stock. This price will not be adjusted
based on changes in market prices or any other factor. However, the number of
shares of HoldCo common stock delivered to Conectiv stockholders is based upon
the average closing price of Pepco common stock during a specified period
shortly before closing. Thus, Conectiv stockholders will not know the value of
the share consideration they will receive in the transaction at the time they
vote. The merger agreement requires that 50% of the consideration paid to
Conectiv stockholders will be paid in shares of HoldCo common stock. The
exchange ratio for the stock consideration is designed to provide Conectiv
common stockholders with HoldCo common stock with a value of $25.00 ($21.69 for
the Class A common stock) if the average closing price of Pepco common stock is
not less than $19.50 nor more than $24.50. However, the market value of Pepco
common stock may fluctuate outside this range as a result of changes in the
businesses, operations, results and prospects of both companies, market
expectations of the likelihood that the transaction will be completed and the
timing of completion, the effect of any conditions or restrictions imposed on
or proposed with respect to the combined company by regulatory agencies,
general market and economic conditions, and other factors. If the average
closing price of Pepco common stock is less than $19.50, the value of the
HoldCo stock delivered to holders of Conectiv common stock would be less than
$25.00 (less than $21.69 for the Class A common stock).

   Conectiv has the option, but is not required, to terminate the merger
agreement if the average closing price of Pepco common stock is below $16.50,
subject to Pepco's right to increase the value of the stock portion of the
merger consideration using either cash or additional Holdco common stock or a
combination of cash and Holdco common stock, to $21.15 per share of Conectiv
common stock (and $18.35 per share of Conectiv Class A common stock), which is
approximately equal to the value Conectiv stockholders would receive if Pepco's
average closing price were $16.50. It is not possible to know until the fifth
business day before the closing of the transaction if the average closing price
of Pepco common stock will be less than $16.50. Conectiv cannot predict now
whether or not the Conectiv Board would exercise its right to terminate the
merger agreement if the average closing price were less than $16.50. The merger
agreement does not provide for a resolicitation of Conectiv stockholders in the
event that the average closing price is less than $16.50 and the Conectiv Board
nevertheless chooses, in the exercise of its fiduciary duties, to complete the
transaction.

   Pepco stockholders will receive one share of HoldCo common stock for each
share of Pepco common stock that they hold and, thus, at the effective time of
the transaction, one share of HoldCo common stock should, although it may not,
have the same value of one share of Pepco common stock immediately prior to the
effective time of the transaction.

   Failure to manage and coordinate the operations of our two companies may
have an adverse effect on the financial condition and results of future
operations of the combined company.

   After the transaction, we will need to manage and coordinate the operations
of our two companies, including their electric utility operations and
potentially several diversified operations. Failure to successfully manage and
coordinate our operations could have a material adverse effect on our business,
or, results of

operations. Managing and coordinating two companies like Pepco and Conectiv
involves a number of risks, including:

  .   the diversion of management's attention away from ongoing operations;

  .   difficulties in the combining of operations and systems;

  .   difficulties in the assimilation and retention of employees;

  .   challenges in keeping customers; and

  .   potential adverse short-term effects on operating results.

   As a result, we may not be able to achieve revenue enhancements and other
size-related benefits of the transaction at all or in a timely manner because
of unexpected costs or difficulties in managing and coordinating these
operations.

   We may not be able to obtain regulatory approvals in a timely manner or on
satisfactory terms.

   Obtaining these approvals will likely delay the transaction for several
months after the stockholder meetings. These approvals may impose conditions on
the operations of HoldCo, Pepco, and Conectiv, and possibly on the operations
of HoldCo's other subsidiaries, which could have a material adverse effect on
the business and/or results of operations of HoldCo.

   Pepco's stockholders will be exchanging shares of an operating company for
shares of a holding company which will be subject to certain restrictions with
respect to the payment of dividends in addition to those currently applicable
to Pepco and which will be more highly leveraged than Pepco is currently.

   Unlike Pepco, HoldCo will not have any operating income of its own. Thus,
the ability of HoldCo to pay dividends to its common stockholders will depend
on dividends received from its subsidiaries. In addition to their future
financial performance, the ability of the subsidiaries to pay dividends to
HoldCo will be subject to the limits imposed by:

  .   state corporate and regulatory law;

  .   the 1935 Act;

  .   the provisions of their respective charters and bylaws;

  .   the prior rights of holders of existing and any future preferred stock;

  .   the prior rights of holders of existing and any future mortgage bonds;
      and

  .   the prior rights of holders of existing and future long-term debt, and
      other restrictions in connection with other liabilities.

Conectiv is currently a holding company registered under the 1935 Act and is
subject to similar restrictions.

   In addition, Pepco currently anticipates that the amount necessary to fund a
portion of the total cash consideration to be paid to Conectiv stockholders
will be financed through external borrowings or other obligations of Holdco. As
a result of this financing and the combination of Pepco and Conectiv in the
transaction, HoldCo will be more highly leveraged than Pepco is currently,
which may result in HoldCo having a lower securities rating than Pepco has
currently.

                   A CAUTION ABOUT FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS

   The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 provides a "safe
harbor" for forward-looking statements to encourage such disclosures without
the threat of litigation, provided those statements are identified as forward-
looking and are accompanied by meaningful, cautionary statements identifying
important factors that could cause the actual results to differ materially from
those projected in the statement. Forward-looking statements have been made in
this joint proxy statement/prospectus. The matters discussed throughout this
joint proxy statement/prospectus that are not historical facts are forward-
looking. Such statements are based on management's beliefs as well as
assumptions made by, and information currently available to, management. When
used herein, the words "will," "anticipate," "estimate," "expect," "believe"
and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements
that involve estimates, projections, goals, forecasts, assumptions and
uncertainties that could cause actual results or outcomes to differ materially
from those expressed in the forward-looking statements.

   Examples of factors that should be considered with respect to any forward-
looking statements made throughout this joint proxy statement/prospectus
include, but are not limited to, the following:

  .   prevailing governmental policies, regulatory actions, laws, and legal
      or public policy doctrines, and changes or developments in the
      foregoing;

  .   risks and uncertainties relating to delays in obtaining or adverse
      conditions contained in, related regulatory approvals;

  .   availability and cost of capital;

  .   changes in weather patterns;

  .   changes in economic conditions;

  .   changes in and compliance with environmental and safety laws and
      policies;

  .   population growth rates and demographic patterns;

  .   competition for customers;

  .   growth in demand, sales and capacity to fulfill demand;

  .   changes in tax rates or policies or in rates of inflation;

  .   unanticipated changes in operating expenses and capital expenditures;

  .   competition for new energy delivery business opportunities and other
      opportunities;

  .   legal and administrative proceedings (whether civil or criminal) and
      settlements that influence the business and profitability of the
      companies;

  .   success in marketing services;

  .   possible development of alternative technologies;

  .   the ability to secure electric and natural gas supply to fulfill sales
      commitments at favorable prices; and

  .   the cost of fuel.

   The effects of these factors are difficult to predict. New factors emerge
from time to time and we can not assess the impact of any such factor on the
business or the extent to which any factor, or combination of factors, may
cause results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking
statement. Any forward-looking statements speak only as of the date of this
joint proxy statement/prospectus, and neither Pepco nor Conectiv undertakes any
obligation to update any forward-looking statement to reflect events or
circumstances after the date of such statement or to reflect the occurrence of
unanticipated events.

   These forward-looking statements are found at various places throughout this
joint proxy statement/prospectus and the other documents incorporated by
reference in this joint proxy statement/prospectus, including, but not limited
to, the Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for the quarters ended March 31, 2000,
June 30, 2000 and September 30, 2000 and the Annual Reports on Form 10-K for
the year ended December 31, 1999 for each of Pepco and Conectiv (including any
amendments to the Quarterly Reports or the Annual Reports) and the Current
Report of Pepco on Form 8-K filed on January 25, 2001.

                               THE PEPCO MEETING

Date and Purpose of the Annual and Special Meetings

   Pepco is jointly holding an annual meeting for holders of Pepco common stock
and a special meeting for holders of Pepco preferred stock. We refer to these
meetings collectively as the Pepco meeting. This information is furnished by
the Pepco Board in connection with its solicitation of proxies to vote on the
matters being submitted to a vote at the meeting.

   The Pepco annual meeting is scheduled to be held on    , at    , local time,
at      . It may be adjourned to another date and/or place for proper purposes.
The purpose of the annual meeting is to consider and vote upon a proposal to
approve the merger agreement and the related transactions, to vote upon a
proposal to approve the HoldCo Long-Term Incentive Plan proposed for HoldCo, to
vote on the election to the Pepco Board three directors to serve for three
years, one director to serve for two years and one director to serve for one
year, to vote on a stockholder proposal if it is properly brought before the
meeting, and to conduct any other business that may properly come before the
annual meeting.

   The Pepco special meeting is scheduled to be held, jointly with the annual
meeting, on    , at    , local time, at      . It may be adjourned to another
date and/or place for proper purposes. The purpose of the special meeting is to
consider and vote upon a proposal to approve the merger agreement and the
related transactions.

   The Pepco Board has approved and adopted the merger agreement, believes that
the terms of the transaction are advisable and are fair to Pepco's
stockholders, and recommends that the stockholders of Pepco vote "FOR" approval
of the merger agreement and the related transactions, "FOR" approval of the
HoldCo Long-Term Incentive Plan, "FOR" the election of the directors and
"AGAINST" the stockholder proposal relating to the election of directors, if
such proposal is brought before the meeting. The completion of the transactions
contemplated by the merger agreement is conditioned upon, among other things,
the approval of the merger agreement and the related transactions by Pepco's
stockholders.

Record Date for the Pepco Meeting and Who is Entitled to Vote at the Pepco
Meeting

   Pepco Record Date. The Pepco Board has fixed the close of business on      ,
2001 as the record date for the determination of the Pepco stockholders
entitled to receive notice of and to vote at the Pepco meeting. As of      ,
2001, the most recent practicable date prior to the printing of this joint
proxy statement/prospectus,     shares of Pepco common stock and     shares of
Pepco preferred stock were outstanding and entitled to be voted at the meeting.

   Voting Rights. Each share of Pepco common stock and each share of Pepco
preferred stock entitles its holder to one vote for each share held on the
Pepco Record Date on each matter that may properly come before the meeting.

   Quorum Requirements. In order to hold the meeting, (1) the holders of a
majority of the outstanding shares of Pepco common stock entitled to be voted
at the meeting must be present in person or by proxy and (2) the holders of a
majority of the outstanding shares of Pepco common stock and preferred stock
entitled to be voted at the meeting, taken together, must be present in person
or by proxy. Abstentions and broker non-votes are counted as present for the
purposes of establishing a quorum. If a quorum is not present at the meeting,
management may adjourn or postpone the Pepco meeting in order to solicit
additional proxies.

   Vote Required. The affirmative votes of (1) the holders of two-thirds of the
outstanding shares of Pepco common stock voting separately as a class and (2)
the holders of a majority of all the outstanding shares of Pepco common stock
and Pepco preferred stock voting together as a single class are required to
approve the merger agreement and related transactions. The affirmative vote of
the holders of a majority of the shares of Pepco common stock present in person
or represented by proxy and entitled to vote at the annual meeting is required
to approve the HoldCo Long-Term Incentive Plan. Nominees for election as
directors will be elected

by a plurality of the votes cast, meaning the number of nominees for each
respective class receiving the largest number of votes will be elected to the
directorships being voted upon. Adoption of the stockholder proposal relating
to election of directors requires the affirmative vote of the holders of a
majority of the shares of Pepco common stock present in person or represented
by proxy and entitled to vote at the annual meeting.

   Abstentions, Failures to Vote, and Broker Non-Votes. Pepco intends to count
shares of Pepco common and preferred stock held by persons who are present in
person at the annual or special meeting but not voting, and shares of Pepco
common and preferred stock for which it has received proxies but with respect
to which holders of those shares have abstained with respect to one or more
matters, as present at the annual or special meeting, as the case may be, for
purposes of determining the presence or absence of a quorum for the transaction
of business. Under applicable NYSE rules, brokers who hold Pepco common or
preferred stock in nominee or "street name" for customers who are the
beneficial owners of those shares are prohibited from giving a proxy to vote
shares held for those customers with respect to the merger agreement and the
HoldCo Long-Term Incentive Plan without specific instructions from those
customers. These unvoted shares are called "broker non-votes." Brokers who hold
Pepco common or preferred stock as nominees, however, are permitted to vote any
such shares on the other matters being submitted to a vote at the meeting.

   Because approval of the merger agreement requires the affirmative votes of
(1) the holders of two-thirds of the outstanding shares of Pepco common stock
voting separately as a class and (2) the holders of a majority of all the
outstanding shares of Pepco common stock and Pepco preferred stock voting
together as a single class, abstentions and broker non-votes will have the same
effect as negative votes. Also, the failure to vote your shares will also have
the same effect as a negative vote. Accordingly, the Pepco Board urges you to
complete, date and sign the accompanying proxy and return it promptly in the
enclosed, postage-paid envelope.

   Approval of the HoldCo Long-Term Incentive Plan requires the affirmative
vote of the holders of a majority of the shares of Pepco common stock present
in person or represented by proxy and entitled to vote at the annual meeting.
Abstentions will be deemed present and entitled to vote, but will not be
counted as votes either for or against the HoldCo Long-Term Incentive Plan, and
therefore will have the same effect as votes against the approval of the plan.
Shares that are the subject of broker non-votes will be counted as shares not
entitled to vote.

   Abstentions will be deemed present and entitled to vote, but will not be
counted as a vote either for or against the approval of the stockholder
proposal, and therefore will have the same effect as a vote against the
approval of the stockholder proposal.

   The failure to vote your shares will have no effect on the election of
directors to the Pepco Board.

   As of February 28, 2001, the directors and executive officers of Pepco,
together with their affiliates, collectively owned beneficially approximately
    shares of Pepco common stock and no shares of Pepco preferred stock, or
approximately  % of the shares entitled to vote at the annual meeting. It is
currently expected that each director or executive officer will vote the shares
of Pepco common stock beneficially owned by him or her for approval of the
merger agreement.

   Additional information with respect to beneficial ownership of Pepco common
and preferred stock by persons and entities owning more than 5% of the
outstanding shares of Pepco common and/or preferred stock and more detailed
information with respect to beneficial ownership of Pepco common and preferred
stock by directors and executive officers of Pepco is set forth under "Security
Ownership of Certain Beneficial Owners and Management" beginning on page 127,
of this joint proxy statement/prospectus.

Voting by Proxy and How to Revoke Your Proxy

   You may vote shares either in person or by duly authorized proxy. You may
use the proxy accompanying this joint proxy statement/prospectus if you are
unable to attend the meeting in person or you wish to have your shares voted by
proxy even if you do attend the meeting. You may revoke your proxy at any time
before the

proxy is exercised (1) by delivering a written notice of revocation, (2) by
filing with the corporate secretary of Pepco a subsequently dated, properly
executed proxy, or (3) by attending the meeting and voting in person. Your
attendance at the meeting, by itself, will not constitute a revocation of a
proxy. You should address any written notices of proxy revocation to: Potomac
Electric Power Company, 1900 Pennsylvania Avenue, N.W., Washington, D.C. 20068,
Attention: Corporate Secretary. If your shares are held in nominee or street
name by a bank or broker, you should follow the directions on the instruction
form you receive from your bank or broker as to how to vote, change your vote,
or revoke your proxy.

   All shares of Pepco common stock represented by effective proxies on the
accompanying white form of Pepco proxy received by Pepco at or before the Pepco
meeting, and not revoked before they are exercised, will be voted at the
applicable meeting in accordance with their terms. If no instructions are
given, the Pepco proxies will be voted "FOR" the approval of the merger
agreement and the related transactions, "FOR" the approval of the HoldCo Long-
Term Incentive Plan, "FOR" the election of directors, and "AGAINST" the
stockholder proposal relating to the election of directors, if such proposal is
brought before the meeting; and at the discretion of the proxy holders on any
other matters that properly come before the applicable meeting.

   If you are a participant in the Pepco Shareholder Dividend Reinvestment
Plan, the white proxy card includes the shares held for your account under the
plan. Those shares will be voted, along with the other shares represented by
the proxy card, in accordance with the instructions given or, if no
instructions are indicated on a properly signed and returned proxy, in the same
manner as the other shares represented on the proxy card. If a participant in
the plan does not return a duly executed proxy card, the participant's shares
will not be voted.

   All shares of Pepco preferred stock represented by effective proxies on the
accompanying yellow form of Pepco proxy received by Pepco at or before the
Pepco meeting, and not revoked before they are exercised, will be voted at the
meeting in accordance with their terms. If no instructions are given, the Pepco
proxies will be voted "FOR" the approval of the merger agreement and the
related transactions.

   The Pepco Board is not aware of any other matters to be presented at the
Pepco annual meeting other than matters incidental to the conduct of the Pepco
annual meeting.

   If an adjournment occurs, it will have no effect on the ability of Pepco
stockholders of record as of the Pepco Record Date to exercise their voting
rights or to revoke any previously delivered proxies.

Solicitation of Proxies

   Pepco will bear the entire cost of the solicitation of proxies for the Pepco
meeting and will split with Conectiv the cost of printing and filing this joint
proxy statement/prospectus. In addition to the solicitation of proxies by mail,
officers, directors, employees and agents of Pepco may solicit proxies by
correspondence, telephone or other electronic means, or in person, but without
extra compensation. Pepco has retained     to assist it in the solicitation of
proxies for the Pepco meetings at a cost of approximately $    plus
reimbursement of reasonable out-of-pocket expenses. Pepco will request banks
and brokers to send proxies and proxy materials to the beneficial owners of
Pepco common and preferred stock and secure their voting instructions, and will
reimburse these banks and brokers for their reasonable charges and expenses
incurred in forwarding the proxies and proxy materials.

                          THE CONECTIV ANNUAL MEETING

Date and Purpose of Annual Meeting

   The annual meeting of stockholders of Conectiv is scheduled to be held on
    , 2001, at  :  .m., local time, at                  . It may be adjourned
to another date and/or place for proper purposes. The purpose of the annual
meeting is to consider and vote upon a proposal to adopt the merger agreement
and the related transactions, to vote upon a proposal to approve the HoldCo
Long-Term Incentive Plan, to vote on the election of three members of the
Conectiv Board to serve for three years, and to conduct any other business that
may properly come before the annual meeting.

   The Conectiv Board has approved the merger agreement, believes that the
terms of the transaction are advisable and are fair to and in the best
interests of Conectiv's stockholders, and recommends that the holders of
Conectiv stock vote "FOR" adoption of the merger agreement and the related
transactions, "FOR" approval of the HoldCo Long-Term Incentive Plan, and "FOR"
the election of the directors. The completion of the transactions contemplated
by the merger agreement is conditioned upon, among other things, the adoption
of the merger agreement and the related transactions by holders of Conectiv
stock.

Record Date for the Conectiv Meeting and Who is Entitled to Vote at the
Conectiv Meeting

   Conectiv Record Date. The Conectiv Board has fixed the close of business on
    , 2001, as the record date for the determination of the holders of Conectiv
stock entitled to receive notice of and to vote at the Conectiv meeting. A
complete list of stockholders entitled to vote at the meeting will be open to
examination by the stockholders, during regular business hours, for a period of
ten days before the annual meeting at the principal executive offices of
Conectiv, 800 King Street, Wilmington, Delaware 19801. As of the Conectiv
Record Date, a total of approximately  ,  ,   shares are entitled to vote. This
includes approximately  ,   ,     shares of Conectiv common stock and
approximately  ,   ,    shares of Conectiv Class A common stock. Conectiv
common stock and Conectiv Class A common stock are one class for voting
purposes, with each share having one vote.

   Voting Rights. Each share of Conectiv common stock and each share of
Conectiv Class A common stock entitles its holder to one vote for each share
held on the Conectiv Record Date on each matter that may properly come before
the meeting.

   Quorum Requirements. A majority of the shares issued and outstanding and
entitled to vote at the Conectiv meeting, present in person or represented at
the meeting, by telephone or Internet proxy, or by signed proxy cards, will
constitute a quorum for the transaction of business at the Conectiv meeting.
Telephone and Internet proxies and signed and dated proxy cards count toward a
quorum, even if the stockholder abstains or does not vote on some or all of the
proposals. Abstentions and broker non-votes are counted as present for the
purposes of establishing a quorum. If a quorum is not present at the meeting,
management may adjourn or postpone the Conectiv meeting in order to solicit
additional proxies.

   Vote Required. The affirmative votes of the holders of a majority of all the
outstanding shares of Conectiv common stock and Conectiv Class A common stock,
voting together as a single class, are required to adopt the merger agreement
and related transactions. The affirmative votes of the holders of a majority of
the shares of Conectiv common stock and Conectiv Class A common stock, voting
together as a single class, present in person or represented, by telephone or
Internet proxy, or by signed proxy cards, and entitled to vote at the annual
meeting, are required to approve the HoldCo Long-Term Incentive Plan. Nominees
for election as directors will be elected by a plurality of the votes cast,
meaning the nominees receiving the largest number of votes will be elected for
the director positions being voted upon.

   Abstentions, Failures to Vote, and Broker Non-Votes. Conectiv intends to
count shares of Conectiv stock present in person at the annual meeting but not
voting, and shares of Conectiv stock for which it has received proxies (by
telephone, by Internet, or by signed proxy cards), but with respect to which
holders of

those shares have abstained, as present at the annual meeting for purposes of
determining the presence or absence of a quorum for the transaction of
business. Under applicable NYSE rules, brokers who hold Conectiv stock in
nominee or "street name" for customers who are the beneficial owners of those
shares are prohibited from giving a proxy to vote shares held for those
customers with respect to the merger agreement or the HoldCo Long-Term
Incentive Plan without specific instructions from those customers. These
unvoted shares are called "broker non-votes." Brokers who hold Conectiv stock
as nominees or in "street name", however, will have discretionary authority to
vote any such shares on any other matters that properly come before the
meeting.

   Because approval of the merger agreement requires the affirmative votes of
the holders of a majority of all the outstanding shares of Conectiv common
stock and Conectiv Class A common stock, voting together as a single class,
abstentions and broker non-votes will have the same effect as negative votes.
Accordingly, the Conectiv Board urges you to complete, date and sign the
accompanying proxy and return it promptly in the enclosed, postage-paid
envelope, or to take advantage of the telephone or Internet proxy procedures
available to you.

   Approval of the HoldCo Long-Term Incentive Plan requires the affirmative
vote of the holders of a majority of the shares of Conectiv stock present in
person or represented by proxy and entitled to vote at the annual meeting.
Abstentions will be deemed present and entitled to vote, but will not be
counted as votes for or against the HoldCo Long-Term Incentive Plan, and
therefore will have the same effect as votes against the approval of the plan.
Shares that are the subject of broker-non votes will be counted as shares not
entitled to vote.

   The failure to vote your shares will have no effect on the election of
directors to the Conectiv Board.

   As of the Conectiv Record Date, the directors and executive officers of
Conectiv, together with their affiliates, collectively beneficially owned
approximately      shares of Conectiv common stock and      shares of Conectiv
Class A common stock, or approximately  % of the shares entitled to vote at the
annual meeting. It is currently expected that each director or executive
officer will vote the shares of Conectiv stock beneficially owned by him or her
for approval of the merger agreement.

   Additional information with respect to beneficial ownership of Conectiv
stock by persons and entities owning more than 5% of the outstanding shares of
Conectiv stock and more detailed information with respect to beneficial
ownership of Conectiv stock by directors and executive officers of Conectiv is
included under the heading "Information About the Conectiv Annual Meeting" on
page 138.

Voting by Proxy and How to Revoke Your Proxy

   You may grant your Conectiv proxy in one of three ways:

  1.   by telephone; or

  2.   over the Internet, as described on the proxy card; or

  3.   mark your instructions on the enclosed proxy card, sign and date it,
       and return it in the postage-paid envelope.

   Your instructions are given to the proxyholders identified on the card, who
will vote as you instruct. If you sign and date the card, but do NOT give an
instruction on a proposal, the proxyholders will vote for you on that proposal.

   You may vote by proxy if you are unable to attend the Conectiv meeting in
person or you wish to have your shares voted by proxy even if you do attend the
annual meeting. You may revoke any proxy given by you in response to this
solicitation at any time before the proxy is exercised (1) by delivering a
written notice of revocation, (2) by filing with Conectiv a subsequently dated,
properly executed proxy, or (3) by attending the annual meeting and electing to
vote in person. If you granted a proxy by telephone or through the Internet,
you can also revoke your vote by any of these methods or you can change your
vote by voting again by telephone or through the Internet. Finally, if you
decide to vote by completing and mailing the enclosed proxy card, you

should retain a copy of the voter control number found on the proxy card in the
event that you decide later to change or revoke your proxy by accessing the
Internet or by telephone. Your attendance at the annual meeting, by itself,
will not constitute a revocation of a proxy. You should address any written
notices of proxy revocation to: Conectiv, 800 King Street, Wilmington, Delaware
19801, Attention: Secretary.

   All shares represented by effective proxies, whether on the accompanying
form of Conectiv proxy received by Conectiv at or before the Conectiv meeting,
or through telephone or Internet proxy procedures as described on the proxy
card, and not revoked before they are exercised, will be voted at the meeting
in accordance with their terms. If no instructions are given, the Conectiv
proxies will be voted "FOR" the adoption of the merger agreement and the
related transactions, "FOR" the approval of the HoldCo Long-Term Incentive
Plan, "FOR" the election of directors and at the discretion of the proxyholders
on any other matters that properly come before the meeting. The Conectiv Board
is not aware of any other matters to be presented at the Conectiv meeting other
than matters incidental to the conduct of the Conectiv meeting.

   If a Conectiv stockholder is a participant in the ConectivDirect(TM) Stock
Purchase Plan, the proxy card received by the participant will include the
shares held in the participant's account under the plan, and those shares will
be voted, along with the other shares represented by the proxy card, in
accordance with the instructions given. If no instructions are indicated on an
effective proxy, such shares will be voted "FOR" the adoption of the merger
agreement and the related transactions, "FOR" the approval of the HoldCo Long-
Term Incentive Plan, "FOR" the election of directors and at the discretion of
the proxyholders on any other matters that properly come before the applicable
meeting. If a participant in the plan does not vote by an effective proxy, the
participant's shares will not be voted.

   Conectiv does not expect to adjourn the Conectiv meeting for a period of
time long enough to require the setting of a new record date for the Conectiv
meeting. If an adjournment occurs, it will have no effect on the ability of
Conectiv stockholders of record as of the Conectiv Record Date to exercise
their voting rights or to revoke any previously delivered proxies.

Solicitation of Proxies

   Conectiv will bear the entire cost of the solicitation of proxies for the
Conectiv meeting and will split with Pepco the cost of printing and filing this
joint proxy statement/prospectus. In addition to the solicitation of proxies by
mail, officers, directors, employees and agents of Conectiv may solicit proxies
by correspondence, telephone, telegraph, telecopy or other electronic means, or
in person, but without extra compensation. Conectiv has retained      to assist
it in the solicitation of proxies for the Conectiv meeting at a cost of
approximately $    plus reimbursement of reasonable out-of-pocket expenses.
Conectiv will request banks, brokers and other record holders to send proxies
and proxy materials to the beneficial owners of Conectiv stock and secure their
voting instructions, and will reimburse these banks, brokers and other record
holders for their reasonable charges and expenses incurred in forwarding the
proxies and proxy materials. Further solicitation of proxies may be made by
telephone or oral communication with some Conectiv stockholders following the
original solicitation. All further solicitation will be made by officers and
regular employees of Conectiv who will not be additionally compensated for
their activities.

                                THE TRANSACTION

   This section of the joint proxy statement/prospectus describes certain
aspects of the proposed transaction, but may not include all the information
that a stockholder would like to know. The merger agreement is attached as
Annex A to this joint proxy statement/prospectus. We urge stockholders to read
the merger agreement in its entirety.

General

   The merger agreement provides for a transaction by which Pepco and Conectiv
will become wholly owned subsidiaries of HoldCo. The merger agreement provides
that HoldCo, a newly formed wholly owned subsidiary of Pepco, will form the new
subsidiaries which will be wholly owned by HoldCo. At the effective time of the
transaction, one of two new subsidiaries will be merged with and into Pepco,
with Pepco as the surviving corporation in the Pepco Merger and the other new
subsidiary will be merged with and into Conectiv, with Conectiv as the
surviving corporation in the Conectiv Merger. In the transaction, each share of
Pepco common stock (or fractions of Pepco common stock held in Pepco's dividend
reinvestment plan or a 401(k) plan) will be converted into the right to receive
one share of HoldCo common stock (or an equivalent fraction of HoldCo common
stock, as applicable), and shares of Conectiv common stock and Conectiv Class A
common stock will be converted into the right to receive HoldCo common stock
and cash. Cash payments will be made to all Conectiv stockholders for any
fractional shares due. After the transaction, the common stockholders of Pepco
and Conectiv will together own all of the outstanding shares of common stock of
HoldCo, and each share of each other class of capital stock of Pepco will be
unaffected and remain outstanding. Following the transaction, HoldCo will
register with the SEC as a public utility holding company under the 1935 Act.

   Although the exact exchange ratio and value of the HoldCo common stock that
the Conectiv stockholders will receive in the transaction will not be
determined until after the stockholders have voted and shortly before the date
on which the transaction is completed, we currently estimate, based on the
number of common shares of Pepco and Conectiv currently outstanding on a fully
diluted basis, that Conectiv stockholders will own approximately 33% and Pepco
stockholders will own approximately 67% of the outstanding HoldCo common stock
immediately after the transaction. The transaction is expected to be tax-free
to the extent that stockholders receive HoldCo common stock in exchange for
their shares of Pepco common stock or Conectiv stock as the case may be.

What Stockholders will Receive

   Pepco Stockholders. In the Pepco Merger, each share of Pepco common stock
held by the stockholders of Pepco immediately prior to the effective time of
the transaction will automatically be exchanged into the right to receive one
share of common stock of HoldCo.

   If a Pepco common stockholder holds a fractional share of Pepco common stock
in the Pepco dividend reinvestment plan or through the Pepco 401(k) plan, that
fractional share will be converted to an equivalent fractional share of HoldCo
common stock.

   Conectiv Stockholders. In the Conectiv Merger, shares of Conectiv stock held
by stockholders of Conectiv immediately prior to the effective time of the
transaction will automatically be exchanged into the right to receive the
common stock and cash merger consideration to be paid by HoldCo. With respect
to the merger consideration, Conectiv stockholders will be mailed a form of
election, after the Conectiv annual meeting and the Pepco annual meeting but
before the completion of the transaction, in order to make their elections.
Each holder of Conectiv stock, subject to certain restrictions described below,
may elect to receive in exchange for each of his or her shares of Conectiv
stock, either:

  .   $25.00 in cash ($21.69 for the Class A common stock) or

  .   a number of shares of HoldCo common stock determined by the exchange
      ratio described below, which is designed to provide Conectiv
      stockholders with HoldCo common stock having a market value of $25.00
      ($21.69 for the Class A common stock), subject to the limitations
      described below.

Each holder of Conectiv stock may choose to exchange some or all of his or her
shares for cash and some or all for HoldCo common stock.

   The exchange ratio will be $25.00 divided by the volume-weighted average
(rounded to the nearest $0.0001) of the closing trading prices of Pepco common
stock on the NYSE, as reported in The Wall Street Journal, Eastern Edition, for
the 20 trading days randomly selected by lot out of 30 consecutive trading days
ending on the fifth business day immediately preceding the closing date of the
transaction (which we refer to as the Average Final Price).

   If the Average Final Price is below $19.50, the number of shares of HoldCo
common stock that a Conectiv stockholder will have the right to receive for
each share of Conectiv common stock that he or she holds will be fixed at
1.28205 (1.11227 for the Class A common stock) and if the Average Final Price
is above $24.50, the number of shares of HoldCo common stock received for each
share of Conectiv common stock will be fixed at 1.02041 (.88528 for the Class A
common stock). Therefore, if the Average Final Price is less than $19.50, then
each share of Conectiv common stock exchanged for stock consideration will
receive stock in the transaction with a value of less than $25.00 (less than
$21.69 for the Class A common stock), and if the Average Final Price is more
than $24.50, then each share of Conectiv common stock exchanged for stock
consideration will receive stock in the transaction with a value of more than
$25.00 (more than $21.69 for the Class A common stock). The actual value of
stock consideration received for each share of Conectiv stock will depend on
the Average Final Price and the market price of HoldCo common stock upon
completion of the transaction will not necessarily be the same as the Average
Final Price. The exchange ratio and the actual number of shares of HoldCo
common stock Conectiv stockholders will receive will not be determined until
after Conectiv stockholders vote on the transaction.

   Additionally, 50% of the consideration payable to Conectiv stockholders will
be paid in cash and 50% in HoldCo common stock. In the event that either cash
or stock is oversubscribed, the amount of each that a Conectiv stockholder will
have the right to receive upon exchange of his or her shares of Conectiv stock
will be determined through an allocation and proration formula.

   After Conectiv stockholder elections have been tabulated, the elected
amounts of cash and HoldCo common stock will be subject to allocation and
proration to achieve a mix of aggregate exchange consideration to Conectiv
stockholders that is 50% cash and 50% HoldCo common stock. As a result,
Conectiv stockholders may receive a different combination of cash and HoldCo
common stock than they elected. See "The Merger Agreement--Procedure for
Stockholder Elections" and "The Merger Agreement--Limits on Cash and Stock
Consideration and Allocation Rules" on pages 69 and 70.

   In addition, no fractional shares of HoldCo common stock will be issued to
Conectiv stockholders. If a Conectiv stockholder is otherwise entitled to
receive a fractional share of HoldCo common stock under the exchange procedure
described above, for that fractional share the stockholder will instead have
the right to receive cash, in an amount equal to the product of (i) the
fraction of a share that would otherwise be due to the stockholder and (ii) the
last sales price per share of Pepco common stock reported on the NYSE Composite
Tape as reported in The Wall Street Journal, Eastern Edition, on the closing
date of the transaction.

How the Merger Consideration for the Conectiv Class A Common Stock Was
Determined

   The merger consideration for the Conectiv Class A common stock was
determined pursuant to the provisions of Conectiv's certificate of
incorporation. The certificate of incorporation provides that, in the event of
a merger to which Conectiv is a party, holders of Conectiv Class A common stock
will be entitled to receive the same consideration per share as the holders of
Conectiv common stock multiplied by a ratio of the time-weighted average market
values of the Conectiv Class A common stock to the Conectiv common stock.

   As applied to the transaction, this ratio equals a fraction:

 .  the numerator of which is the sum of:

   .Four times $18.3660, the average market value of one share of Conectiv
    Class A common stock over the period of five consecutive trading days
    ending on February 9, 2001, the date immediately preceding the
    announcement date of the transaction;

   .three times $16.8670, the average market value of one share of Conectiv
    Class A common stock over the period of five consecutive trading days
    ending on the fifth trading day prior to February 9, 2001;

   .two times $15.1563, the average market value of one share of Conectiv
    Class A common stock over the period of five consecutive trading days
    ending on the tenth trading day prior to February 9, 2001; and

   .$13.1813, the average market value of one share of Conectiv Class A
    common stock over the period of five consecutive trading days ending on
    the fifteenth trading day prior to February 9, 2001; and

 .  the denominator of which is the sum of:

   .four times $19.7450, the average market value of one share of Conectiv
    common stock over the first period referred to above;

   .three times $19.2100, the average market value of one share of Conectiv
    common stock over the second period referred to above;

   .two times $19.1063, the average market value of one share of Conectiv
    common stock over the third period referred to above; and

   .$18.3125, the average market value of one share of Conectiv common stock
    over the fourth period referred to above.

   Accordingly, a ratio of 0.86757 was determined by applying this time-
weighted formula, and the merger consideration for the Conectiv Class A common
stock was determined by multiplying the merger consideration for the Conectiv
common stock by 0.86757.

Illustrations of Exchange Ratio Application and Value to Be Received

   The market price of Pepco common stock will fluctuate, and the number of
outstanding shares of Conectiv stock will change, between the date of this
joint proxy statement/prospectus and the effective time of the transaction.
Therefore, while the number of shares of HoldCo common stock to be issued in
the transaction can be estimated, the precise number cannot be determined at
this time.

   The following tables contain examples of the exchange ratio and cash and
stock consideration to be received by Conectiv stockholders in the transaction,
based on various hypothetical Average Final Prices of Pepco common stock and
assuming that a Conectiv stockholder who owns 100 shares of Conectiv common
stock or 100 shares of Conectiv Class A common stock elected to receive 50%
cash and 50% shares of HoldCo common stock as consideration and no proration
occurred. The examples provided assume that the market price of a share of
HoldCo common stock on the day the transaction is completed is equal to the
Average Final Price of Pepco common stock. For each hypothetical Average Final
Price, the table indicates:

  .   the corresponding exchange ratio;

  .   the number and dollar value of whole shares of HoldCo common stock that
      a Conectiv stockholder would receive;

  .   the amount of cash a Conectiv stockholder would receive for any
      fractional share;

  .   the amount of cash consideration that a Conectiv stockholder would
      receive; and

  .   the total value of the cash and stock consideration that a Conectiv
      stockholder would receive.

Conectiv "Walk-Away" Right and Pepco "Top-Up" Right

   Subject to certain rights of Pepco, as described below, Conectiv has the
right to terminate the transaction if the Average Final Price is less than
$16.50, which is approximately 22.56% lower than the 20-day average closing
price of Pepco common stock on February 8, 2001, the last trading day before
the execution of the merger agreement on February 9, 2001, and is  % lower than
the closing price of Pepco common stock on      , 2001. If the Average Final
Price is $16.50, Conectiv common stock would receive HoldCo common stock with a
market value of approximately $21.15 per share ($18.35 per share for the
Conectiv Class A common stock). The $16.50 threshold for the walk-away right
will be appropriately adjusted for any adjustments to the number of shares of
Pepco common stock outstanding that may occur between February 9, 2001 and the
closing of the transaction, such as in a stock split.

   Notwithstanding Conectiv's right to terminate the merger agreement if the
Average Final Price is less than $16.50, before Conectiv may terminate the
merger agreement for that reason, it must give written notice to Pepco of its
intention to terminate, and the termination will be effective at the close of
business on the second business day following the delivery of the notice,
unless Pepco, at its option, chooses to increase the consideration that will be
paid to Conectiv's stockholders for their shares of Conectiv stock. Pepco has
the option of supplementing (or "topping up") the stock portion of the merger
consideration by (i) adjusting the exchange ratio so as to provide Conectiv's
stockholders with HoldCo common stock having a value of $21.15 for each share
of Conectiv common stock and $18.35 for each share of Conectiv Class A common
stock, (ii) maintaining the exchange ratio and paying additional cash to the
stockholders entitled to receive HoldCo

common stock so that they receive a total value of $21.15 for each share of
Conectiv common stock and $18.35 for each share of Conectiv Class A common
stock, or (iii) undertaking a combination of (i) and (ii), provided that any
such combination must be in the same proportion with respect to the Conectiv
common stock and the Conectiv Class A common stock.

   It is not possible to know until the fifth trading day before the closing of
the transaction if the Average Final Price of Pepco common stock will be less
than $16.50. Neither Pepco nor Conectiv can predict whether or not the Conectiv
Board would exercise its right to give notice to Pepco that Conectiv wished to
terminate the transaction, or whether Pepco would exercise its top-up right, if
the Average Final Price were less than $16.50. In making any such decisions,
the Pepco Board and the Conectiv Board would carefully consider, among other
factors, the interests of the respective companies and their respective
stockholders, and may consider such other information as they are each legally
permitted to consider.

   The merger agreement does not provide for a resolicitation of Conectiv
stockholders in the event that the Average Final Price is less than $16.50 and
the Conectiv Board nevertheless chooses to complete the transaction. Therefore,
adoption of the merger agreement by the Conectiv stockholders at the Conectiv
annual meeting will give the Conectiv Board the ability, to be exercised in
accordance with its fiduciary duties, to complete the transaction even if the
Average Final Price is less than $16.50 without any further action by, or
resolicitation of, the Conectiv stockholders.

Background of the Transaction

   Over the past several years, Pepco has carefully monitored market and
regulatory developments in the electric utility industry that have
substantially increased competition in all sectors of the industry and analyzed
how best to position itself in this changing environment. In 1999, Pepco
announced a strategy of being an electricity delivery company with growing
energy and telecommunications retail businesses. Pepco determined that it was
not big enough to achieve the economies of scale that would be needed in the
long term to compete effectively in the rapidly consolidating nationwide
generation business. As a result, Pepco decided to sell the bulk of the
generation facilities it then owned in an auction process, which was completed
in late 2000 and early 2001. The strategy announced by Pepco involves the
continued operation and expansion of an electric distribution system in the
mid-Atlantic region as well as the development of energy and telecommunications
retail operations, in each case through both internal growth and acquisitions.

   Since the commencement of operations of Conectiv in 1998, the Conectiv Board
has carefully followed the developments in the electric and natural gas
industries. The Conectiv Board, with the assistance of management, has
regularly reviewed the on-going restructuring of the energy industry and has
evaluated Conectiv's strategy in this context. After much consideration and
review, and taking into account the legislative developments in Delaware,
Maryland and New Jersey, the Conectiv Board adopted a strategy of disposing of
Conectiv's interests in nuclear generating plants and baseload fossil fuel-
fired generating plants and developing new mid-merit generation plants in the
PJM Interconnection region.

   Between January and July 2000, in the course of several meetings, the
Conectiv Board, together with Conectiv's management and financial advisor,
Credit Suisse First Boston, continued to evaluate the potential impact of the
mid-merit strategy, including its significant capital requirements, on Conectiv
and possible alternatives to implementing this strategy. As the Conectiv Board
weighed the potential risks and benefits of the mid-merit strategy, the
Conectiv Board determined that it should begin to consider the risks and
benefits of potential strategic alternatives, including a possible business
combination involving Conectiv. In this regard, Credit Suisse First Boston
outlined for the Conectiv Board the process for soliciting proposals from
potentially interested parties if the Conectiv Board decided to explore a
possible business combination, and management and Credit Suisse First Boston
discussed with the Conectiv Board potential strategic and financial parties who
might have an interest in such a transaction. During these months, the Conectiv
Board did not take any formal action relating to any potential strategic
alternatives and determined that remaining independent and continuing

to pursue the mid-merit strategy and existing long-term plans remained an
alternative that was available depending on the results of further evaluation.

   During the spring of 2000, an ad hoc committee consisting of independent
outside directors met several times to review in greater detail the possible
acceleration of the mid-merit strategy. In June 2000, based on the
recommendation of this ad hoc committee, the Conectiv Board instructed
management to preserve the option of accelerating the implementation of the
mid-merit strategy. At that time, the Conectiv Board also appointed another ad
hoc committee of three independent outside directors to evaluate other
strategic alternatives and authorized the retention by the ad hoc committee of
outside advisors to assist in this evaluation. This second committee selected
Credit Suisse First Boston as financial advisor and Simpson Thacher & Bartlett
as special legal counsel on behalf of the Conectiv Board in connection with the
evaluation of potential strategic alternatives.

   In August 2000, following several meetings with Credit Suisse First Boston
and Simpson Thacher & Bartlett, the second ad hoc committee authorized Credit
Suisse First Boston, with the consent of the Conectiv Board, to make
preliminary contact with likely possible transaction candidates. In August,
Credit Suisse First Boston contacted 10 potential domestic bidders, including
Pepco, and 5 potential foreign bidders. Thereafter, several additional parties
were contacted.

   When contacted in August 2000 in connection with the process established by
Conectiv, Pepco's management determined that a business combination with
Conectiv was consistent with Pepco's announced regionally-based strategy and,
in October 2000, entered into a confidentiality agreement with Conectiv in
order to participate in the process. At that time, Pepco engaged LeBoeuf, Lamb,
Greene & MacRae, L.L.P. to act as its legal counsel and Merrill Lynch to act as
its financial advisor in the process.

   On September 8, 2000, the Conectiv Board convened to review, among other
matters, a report of the ad hoc committee relating to its evaluation of
potential strategic alternatives. Representatives of Credit Suisse First Boston
reviewed for the Conectiv Board the recent performance of utility stocks and
recent mergers and acquisitions activity in the utility industry and reported
that 10 parties had expressed interest in participating in a business
combination with Conectiv. Credit Suisse First Boston also reviewed a potential
timeline for the process of soliciting transaction bids. Representatives of
Simpson Thacher & Bartlett then reviewed for the Conectiv Board its fiduciary
duties in the context of commencing a process which could lead to a merger or
acquisition transaction. After discussion, the Conectiv Board approved the
recommendation of the ad hoc committee to commence a process for soliciting
transaction proposals.

   Beginning in October 2000, with the assistance of Simpson Thacher & Bartlett
and Potter Anderson & Corroon LLP, Conectiv's legal counsel, Conectiv
negotiated and entered into confidentiality and standstill agreements with 13
parties, including Pepco, for the purpose of facilitating the delivery of
confidential information regarding Conectiv to the parties who expressed an
interest in receiving such information. Beginning on October 14, 2000, each
party that had entered into a confidentiality and standstill agreement received
a confidential information memorandum relating to Conectiv and a letter
inviting submission of preliminary indications of interest by November 13,
2000.

   On October 26, 2000, the Pepco Board met to review the potential
transaction. John M. Derrick, Jr., Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Dennis
R. Wraase, at that time President and Chief Financial Officer and William T.
Torgerson, at that time Senior Vice President, External Affairs and General
Counsel, together with representatives from Merrill Lynch and LeBoeuf, Lamb,
Greene & MacRae, L.L.P. reported to the Pepco Board on the process established
by Conectiv and the status of due diligence review of Conectiv's operations.
The Pepco Board discussed the terms of a potential indication of interest to be
submitted by Pepco to Conectiv and authorized management to proceed with the
indication of interest, with the understanding that any final offer would be
subject to satisfactory completion of due diligence, negotiation of a
definitive merger agreement and approval by the Pepco Board.

   On November 13, 2000, Conectiv received preliminary indications of interest
from six parties for the acquisition of Conectiv. Among the parties expressing
an interest was Pepco.

   On November 17, 2000, at a regularly scheduled meeting of the Conectiv
Board, representatives of Credit Suisse First Boston discussed with the
Conectiv Board the preliminary indications of interest received. The Conectiv
Board decided to continue discussions with five of the initial bidders whose
preliminary proposals offered the highest consideration for the Conectiv
stockholders. The Conectiv Board authorized the process to continue but noted
that it was preserving the option to remain independent, including the option
to continue to implement the mid-merit business plan on an accelerated basis.

   On November 27, 2000, additional confidential materials were distributed to
the five bidders who were invited to continue participating in the process.
Thereafter, in December 2000 and January 2001, Conectiv's management made
presentations to such parties concerning Conectiv and its business operations
and responded to detailed due diligence inquiries.

   On December 5, 2000, the Conectiv Board, at its regularly scheduled meeting,
continued its strategic review process and discussed with management and
representatives of Credit Suisse First Boston the bidders remaining in the
process. Since many of the remaining bidders, including Pepco, had indicated a
desire to pay for the transaction at least partly in stock, Credit Suisse First
Boston also gave an overview of potential "collar" structures and related
issues. Simpson Thacher & Bartlett informed the directors of the material terms
of the draft merger agreement which would be distributed to bidders. Simpson
Thacher & Bartlett explained to the Conectiv Board that the draft merger
agreement would provide for a part cash and part stock consideration and a
fixed value formula without a collar for determining the amount of stock
consideration. Simpson Thacher & Bartlett also explained that the draft merger
agreement would provide that the merger consideration payable to the holders of
the Conectiv Class A common stock would be determined in accordance with
Conectiv's certificate of incorporation.

   On separate occasions between December 2000 and the time the merger
agreement was executed, the Audit Committee of the Conectiv Board met to
consult with Conectiv's legal and financial advisors and to discuss the
Conectiv Board's fiduciary duties, the provisions of Conectiv's certificate of
incorporation and the anticipated terms of the merger agreement, the financial
implications of a business combination and other matters, in each case as they
related to the Conectiv Class A common stock.

   On January 12, 2001, the remaining transaction candidates were sent a letter
outlining the procedures for submitting a final bid for Conectiv, accompanied
by a draft merger agreement prepared by Simpson Thacher & Bartlett.

   On January 23, 2001, a meeting of the Conectiv Board was convened to update
the Conectiv Board on the process for soliciting transaction proposals.
Representatives of Credit Suisse First Boston informed the Conectiv Board that
two of the five parties invited to continue in the process had elected to
withdraw from the process. Credit Suisse First Boston then provided the
Conectiv Board with additional information relating to the three parties,
including Pepco, remaining in the process. Credit Suisse First Boston reported
that one of the three remaining bidders had indicated that it was not prepared
to bid for the entire company alone and accordingly was exploring an on-sale
disposition of Conectiv's generation assets to another party in order to make a
bid. Representatives of Simpson Thacher & Bartlett then provided a review of
the material legal issues that might arise in negotiations with any of the
three remaining bidders, including potential proposals containing collars.
Howard Cosgrove, Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer of Conectiv,
and other members of management provided the Conectiv Board with a regulatory
assessment of a potential transaction with each of the remaining parties.
Potter, Anderson & Corroon and Simpson Thacher & Bartlett further informed the
Conectiv Board of its fiduciary duties in the context of this process and
discussed with the Conectiv Board the provisions of the certificate of
incorporation regarding the treatment of Conectiv Class A common stock.

   On January 24, 2001, Conectiv received an unsolicited letter from a party
expressing interest in acquiring Conectiv. On January 26, 2001, Conectiv's
legal and financial advisors met with this party and its financial and legal
advisors to explore whether a transaction was feasible and the potential timing
of any such transaction. The preliminary price level expressed by this party
was in the high range of the remaining three parties' indications of interest.
This party, however, had not performed due diligence and informed Conectiv's
advisors that it had not yet obtained commitments for the equity or debt
financing required to complete a transaction. This party further advised that
it would require at least another month to complete due diligence and be in a
position to make a definitive proposal and begin to negotiate a definitive
agreement.

   At the Pepco Board's regularly scheduled meeting on January 25, 2001,
following conclusion of the Pepco Board's regularly scheduled business,
representatives of LeBoeuf, Lamb, Greene & MacRae, L.L.P. discussed the duties
of the Pepco Board in considering the submission of a bid to Conectiv as well
as the terms of the proposed merger agreement to be included as part of the bid
package. Representatives of Merrill Lynch discussed the proposed bid to be
submitted to Conectiv. In addition, Messrs. Derrick and Wraase (who in the
interim had been promoted to President and Chief Operating Officer), discussed
the financial and strategic benefits and risks of the proposed transaction in
the context of Pepco's business plans and the results of Pepco's due diligence
review. After considering these discussions as well as the recommendation of
Pepco's management, the Pepco Board authorized management to submit a bid and,
if successful, to enter into a transaction with Conectiv substantially in the
form provided in the bid. The Pepco Board authorized management to negotiate
final terms for a transaction with Conectiv, but required further consultation
with the Pepco Board regarding any material changes from the bid proposal. The
Pepco Board also discussed the rationale behind a potential common stock
dividend reduction and share repurchase program which was then under
consideration and its relationship to the proposed acquisition of Conectiv
should the bid be successful.

   On January 29, 2001, the deadline for all proposals under Conectiv's
process, Pepco submitted a final bid to acquire Conectiv at a price of $24.00
per share of Conectiv common stock. Under Pepco's proposal, half of the
consideration would consist of cash and the other half would consist of stock,
with the stock consideration subject to a collar. The Pepco bid also stated
that Pepco would, simultaneously with the execution of the merger agreement,
announce a reduction of its dividend and a share repurchase program.

   Conectiv did not receive final proposals from the two other remaining
participants in the process. One such participant indicated that its efforts to
collaborate on a bid with a third party purchaser of generation assets were not
successful and thus it would be prepared, with additional due diligence, to
make an offer to purchase only Conectiv's transmission and distribution assets.
The proposed third party purchaser of the generation assets also submitted a
separate letter expressing interest in acquiring the generation assets with an
indicated pricing level that was not considered attractive. The other
participant in this process, a foreign utility company, indicated that it was
not yet prepared to make a final bid because aspects of the transaction were
continuing to be reviewed by its senior executives and that it could not
provide a definitive timeframe for submitting a proposal.

   On January 31, 2001, a telephonic meeting of the Conectiv Board was
convened. At this meeting, the Conectiv Board was briefed by Conectiv's
management and legal and financial advisors on the material aspects of Pepco's
bid, the status of the other two participants and the recent unsolicited
inquiry. After this discussion, the Conectiv Board determined that, in light of
the unattractiveness of selling only a portion of Conectiv and the preliminary
and conditional nature of the unsolicited inquiry, the time and resources it
would take to explore a transaction with either of such parties would delay or
hinder Conectiv's ability to negotiate with Pepco and could jeopardize
negotiation of a transaction with Pepco. The Conectiv Board authorized
management and its advisors to commence negotiations with Pepco, particularly
with respect to increasing the consideration for Conectiv's stockholders, and
also directed Credit Suisse First Boston to ascertain whether a definitive bid
would be forthcoming from the potential foreign bidder. The Conectiv Board
requested that it be kept informed of these negotiations as well as
developments with respect to any other potential bidders.

   On February 2, 2001, at the direction of the Conectiv Board, representatives
of Credit Suisse First Boston contacted representatives of Merrill Lynch, to
convey that a price of $24.00 per share of Conectiv common

stock was not sufficient and to identify other aspects of Pepco's proposal that
raised material issues for Conectiv. Later that day, Merrill Lynch indicated
that Pepco was prepared to pay $24.50 per share of Conectiv common stock in
cash and stock. Over the next few days, representatives of Credit Suisse First
Boston and Merrill Lynch continued to hold discussions on price, the proposed
collar and other material business and financial terms of the proposed
transaction.

   Prior to the end of that week, in accordance with the instructions of the
Conectiv Board, Credit Suisse First Boston attempted to ascertain from the
potential foreign bidder and its financial advisors whether it would eventually
submit a definitive bid, but was unable to obtain any assurances as to the
timing or likelihood of any such bid being made.

   On February 5, 2001, Mr. Cosgrove contacted Mr. Derrick, and stated that
Conectiv was not prepared to negotiate and execute a merger agreement with
Pepco at a price below $25.00 per share of Conectiv common stock. Mr. Cosgrove
and Mr. Derrick also discussed, among other matters, the status of
negotiations, regulatory risks and the number of directors from the Conectiv
Board that should serve on HoldCo's Board to increase representation by
directors resident in or otherwise familiar with the service territories of
Conectiv's utility subsidiaries. Later that evening, Mr. Derrick called Mr.
Cosgrove to convey that Pepco would agree to the $25.00 per share price
requested by Conectiv subject to satisfactory resolution of the other remaining
open issues.

   On February 6, 2001, Simpson Thacher & Bartlett sent to LeBoeuf, Lamb,
Greene & MacRae, L.L.P. a revised draft of the merger agreement reflecting the
prior conversations between the chief executive officers and financial advisors
as well as revisions reflecting Conectiv's response to certain aspects of
Pepco's proposal. Between the evenings of February 6 and February 9, 2001,
representatives of Simpson Thacher & Bartlett, Potter Anderson & Corroon and
LeBoeuf, Lamb, Greene & MacRae, L.L.P., along with Conectiv's and Pepco's
management and financial advisors, met at the offices of Simpson Thacher &
Bartlett to negotiate the merger agreement. During the same period, Conectiv's
management and financial advisors received additional information with respect
to Pepco's dividend reduction and share repurchase program and completed their
due diligence of Pepco.

   On February 8, 2001, the Conectiv Board met to consider and review the terms
of the proposed transaction with Pepco. Representatives of Simpson Thacher &
Bartlett and Potter Anderson & Corroon reviewed for the Conectiv Board its
fiduciary and other legal duties, including duties with respect to the Conectiv
Class A common stock. Mr. Cosgrove reviewed the status of discussions with
Pepco and made a presentation with respect to management's recommendation that
the Conectiv Board approve the proposed transaction with Pepco if the remaining
issues could be resolved in a manner satisfactory to Conectiv. Management then
provided a regulatory assessment of the proposed transaction. Credit Suisse
First Boston then reviewed with the Conectiv Board its financial analysis of
the merger consideration payable in the transaction. Management and Credit
Suisse First Boston also reported on the due diligence that had been conducted
on Pepco. Credit Suisse First Boston also reported that there were no further
developments with respect to other potential bidders. Representatives of
Simpson Thacher & Bartlett then reviewed in detail for the Conectiv Board the
terms of the proposed merger agreement and the other legal aspects of the Pepco
transaction.

   At this meeting, the Conectiv Board discussed, among other matters, the
risks and benefits of the Pepco proposal, taking into account the matters
described above. The Conectiv Board also considered the alternative of
remaining independent and implementing the mid-merit strategy in that context,
along with the execution risks relating to such strategy in light of the
significant investments required by Conectiv going forward in the deregulated
energy markets. After additional discussion and deliberation, the Conectiv
Board authorized management and the advisors to complete the negotiation of the
merger agreement.

   On February 9, 2001, the parties reached agreement on all of the remaining
terms of the merger agreement.

   On February 9, 2001, the Pepco Board held a special meeting by telephone at
which the board was provided updates by management, LeBoeuf, Lamb, Greene &
MacRae, L.L.P. and Merrill Lynch on the final terms of the proposed
transaction with Conectiv. Management also discussed with the board the terms
of the proposed dividend cut and share repurchase program. At that time,
Merrill Lynch delivered its oral opinion to the Pepco Board (which was
subsequently confirmed in writing) that, as of that date and based on the
assumptions made, matters considered and limitations reviewed with the Pepco
Board, the Pepco exchange ratio was fair from a financial point of view to the
holders of Pepco common stock, taking into account the Conectiv Merger, and
the consideration to be paid by Pepco in connection with the Conectiv Merger
was fair from a financial point of view to Pepco. After considering and
discussing these matters as well as the recommendation of management, the
Pepco Board, by a unanimous vote, approved the merger agreement and the
transactions contemplated thereby and authorized the execution of the merger
agreement. The Pepco Board also approved a dividend cut, effective with the
June 30 dividend to a rate of $1.00 annually and a share repurchase program
not to exceed $450 million in the aggregate. On February 9, 2001, Pepco caused
HoldCo to be formed in the State of Delaware and the HoldCo Board approved the
merger agreement.

   On the evening of February 9, 2001, a telephonic meeting of the Conectiv
Board was convened. Mr. Cosgrove reported on the progress of the final
negotiations with Pepco and reaffirmed management's recommendation of the
proposed transaction on the terms that had been negotiated. At this meeting,
Credit Suisse First Boston rendered to the Conectiv Board an oral opinion,
which opinion was confirmed by delivery of a written opinion dated February 9,
2001, to the effect that, as of that date and based on and subject to the
matters described in the opinion, the Conectiv common stock consideration was
fair, from a financial point of view, to the holders of Conectiv common stock
and the Conectiv Class A common stock consideration was fair, from a financial
point of view, to the holders of Conectiv Class A common stock. The Audit
Committee reported to the Conectiv Board that, at a telephonic meeting
convened earlier that evening, it had determined that the consideration for
the Conectiv Class A common stock under the merger agreement was determined in
accordance with Conectiv's certificate of incorporation and decided to
recommend the transaction to the Conectiv Board. After additional discussion
and deliberation, the Conectiv Board approved the merger and the merger
agreement and decided to recommend to Conectiv stockholders that they adopt
the merger agreement. One of the nine directors, citing concerns over the
number of Conectiv directors to be appointed to the HoldCo Board, voted
against approval of the transaction.

   Later that evening, the merger agreement was executed by Pepco, Conectiv
and HoldCo.

Pepco Reasons for the Transaction

   The Pepco Board believes that the transaction will result in the following
significant benefits to Pepco:

   Strategically Attractive Opportunity Consistent with Pepco's Stated
Strategy. Conectiv's substantial transmission and distribution services,
including those located in the growing New Jersey market, provide an
attractive opportunity for Pepco to further its stated strategy of increasing
its transmission and distribution business in the Mid-Atlantic region.

   Stronger Competitive Regional Position. The combined company will serve
more than approximately 1.8 million electricity customers in Delaware, the
District of Columbia, Maryland, New Jersey and Virginia and will be the
largest electricity delivery company in the PJM Interconnection. The combined
company's greater transmission and distribution capabilities should provide
the combined company with the size and scope to compete more effectively,
including in the related retail services market.

 Increased Financial Strength

  .   The financial strength of the combined company's balance sheet, which
      is expected to have a solid investment grade, should provide an
      opportunity to increase earnings while supporting the growth objectives
      established for both regulated and nonregulated businesses.

  .   Since the base over which the cost of various initiatives will be
      spread will be increased with the combined company, future initiatives,
      such as new technology improvements, undertaken by the combined company
      should be achieved more cost efficiently than if the same initiatives
      were implemented by each of the companies separately, and should result
      in a higher level of service, reliability and responsiveness to utility
      customers. In addition, these cost efficiencies should enable the
      combined company to keep customer rates in the regulated businesses
      lower than they would otherwise be.

Recommendation of the Pepco Board

   At a special meeting held on February 9, 2001, the Pepco Board unanimously
approved and adopted the merger agreement after determining that the
transaction was fair to and in the best interests of Pepco and its
stockholders.

   During the course of their deliberations relating to the merger agreement,
the Pepco Board consulted with their management and legal and financial
advisors and considered the following factors in addition to the expected
benefits described above:

  .   Terms and Conditions of the Merger Agreement. The terms and conditions
      of the merger agreement, the terms of the termination provisions and
      the amount and circumstances in which a termination fee and expenses
      could become payable by Pepco and Conectiv and the course of
      negotiations resulting in the execution of the merger agreement.

  .   Operating and Financial Condition. The business, operations, financial
      condition, operating results and prospects of Pepco and Conectiv.

  .   Fit and Compatibility. The strategic fit, compatible corporate cultures
      and visions of the future of the energy business of Pepco and Conectiv,
      including the regionally based operations of Pepco and Conectiv and
      each company's emphasis on the energy delivery business.

  .   Industry Restructuring. The possible effects of the changing regulatory
      environment in the utility industry and the trend by energy and utility
      companies towards consolidations that create larger and stronger
      companies better able to face increased competition in the industry.

  .   Fairness Opinion. The analysis of Merrill Lynch presented to the Pepco
      Board on January 25, 2001 and the written opinion dated as of February
      9, 2001 from Merrill Lynch to the Pepco Board to the effect that, as of
      that date and based upon the assumptions made, matters considered and
      limitations reviewed with the Pepco Board, the Pepco exchange ratio was
      fair from a financial point of view to the holders of Pepco common
      stock, taking into account the Conectiv Merger, and the consideration
      to be paid by Pepco in connection with the Conectiv Merger was fair
      from a financial point of view to Pepco.

  .   Timing and Achievability; Regulatory Issues. The anticipated timing
      required to complete the transaction including, in particular, the
      expected timing to obtain required regulatory approvals and
      management's view as to the likelihood of obtaining the required
      approvals without the imposition of conditions that would materially
      adversely affect Pepco or Conectiv; and the impact on Pepco and
      Conectiv of operating as subsidiaries of a holding company registered
      as such under the 1935 Act, including financial, operational, and
      structural implications of that registration.

  .   Transactional Factors. The costs of undertaking and completing the
      transaction, including the expense, devotion of management's time to
      the exploration of the transaction, to the preparation of the merger
      agreement and to the tasks required to complete the transaction; the
      risks of fluctuation to Pepco's stock price prior to consummation of
      the transaction; the potential effects of the public announcement of
      the transaction on Pepco's stock price and the results of the due
      diligence review of Conectiv's operations.

  .   Interests of Certain Persons. The potential interests of certain
      persons in the transaction that are or may be different from, or in
      addition to, the interests of Pepco's stockholders, as described in
      "The Transaction--Interests of Certain Persons in the Transaction"
      beginning on page 63.

   The discussion above of the material factors considered by the Pepco Board
in its consideration of the merger agreement is not intended to be all-
inclusive. In view of the variety of factors and the amount of information
considered, the Pepco Board did not find it practicable to, and did not, make
specific assessments of, quantify, or otherwise assign relative weights to the
specific factors considered in reaching its determination. The determination to
approve the merger agreement was made after consideration of all the factors
taken as a whole, though individual members of the Pepco Board may have given
different weights to different factors.

   The Pepco Board unanimously recommends that its stockholders vote "FOR"
approval of the merger agreement and related transactions.

Opinion of the Financial Advisor to Pepco

   On February 9, 2001, at a special meeting of the Pepco Board, Merrill Lynch
delivered its oral opinion that, as of that date and based on the assumptions
made, matters considered and limitations reviewed with the Pepco Board, the
Pepco exchange ratio was fair from a financial point of view to the holders of
Pepco common stock, taking into account the Conectiv Merger, and the
consideration to be paid by Pepco in connection with the Conectiv Merger was
fair from a financial point of view to Pepco. Merrill Lynch subsequently
confirmed its oral opinion by delivery of its written opinion dated February 9,
2001.

   The full text of the Merrill Lynch opinion, which states the assumptions
made, procedures followed, matters considered, and qualifications and
limitations on the scope of the review undertaken by Merrill
Lynch in rendering its opinion, is included in this joint proxy
statement/prospectus as Annex D. The Merrill Lynch opinion is for the use and
benefit of the Pepco Board and addresses only the fairness, from a financial
point of view, to the holders of Pepco common stock of the Pepco exchange
ratio, taking into account the Conectiv Merger, and to Pepco of the
consideration to be paid by Pepco in connection with the Conectiv Merger. The
Merrill Lynch opinion does not address the merits of the underlying decision by
Pepco to engage in the transaction and does not constitute a recommendation to
any holder of Pepco common stock or Pepco preferred stock as to how such
stockholder should vote on the proposed transaction. The Merrill Lynch opinion
does not express any opinion as to the price at which the shares of common
stock of Pepco or HoldCo will trade following the announcement or consummation
of the transaction. The description of Merrill Lynch opinion is qualified in
its entirety by reference to the full text of the Merrill Lynch opinion.
Holders of Pepco stock are urged to, and should, read the Merrill Lynch opinion
carefully in its entirety.

   In arriving at its opinion, Merrill Lynch, among other things:

  .   reviewed certain publicly available business and financial information
      relating to Conectiv and Pepco that Merrill Lynch deemed to be
      relevant;

  .   reviewed certain information, including financial forecasts, relating
      to the business, earnings, cash flow, assets, liabilities and prospects
      of Conectiv and Pepco, furnished to Merrill Lynch by Conectiv and
      Pepco, respectively;

  .   conducted discussions with members of senior management and
      representatives of Conectiv and Pepco concerning the matters described
      in the two bullet points above, as well as their respective businesses
      and prospects before and after giving effect to the transaction;

  .   reviewed the market prices and valuation multiples for shares of
      Conectiv common stock and Pepco common stock and compared them with
      those of certain publicly traded companies that Merrill Lynch deemed to
      be relevant;

  .   reviewed the results of operations of Conectiv and Pepco and compared
      them with those of certain publicly traded companies that Merrill Lynch
      deemed to be relevant;

  .   compared the proposed financial terms of the transaction with the
      financial terms of certain other transactions that Merrill Lynch deemed
      to be relevant;

  .   participated in certain discussions and negotiations among
      representatives of Conectiv and Pepco and their financial and legal
      advisors;

  .   reviewed the potential pro forma impact of the transaction;

  .   reviewed a draft dated February 8, 2001 of the merger agreement; and

  .   reviewed such other financial studies and analyses and took into
      account such other matters as Merrill Lynch deemed necessary, including
      Merrill Lynch's assessment of general economic, market and monetary
      conditions.

   In preparing its opinion, Merrill Lynch assumed and relied on the accuracy
and completeness of all information supplied or otherwise made available to it,
discussed with or reviewed by or for it, or publicly available, and Merrill
Lynch did not assume any responsibility for independently verifying such
information or undertake an independent evaluation or appraisal of any of the
assets or liabilities of Conectiv or Pepco. In addition, Merrill Lynch did not
assume any obligation to conduct any physical inspection of the properties or
facilities of Conectiv or Pepco. With respect to the financial forecast
information furnished to or discussed with Merrill Lynch by Conectiv or Pepco,
Merrill Lynch assumed that they have been reasonably prepared and reflect the
best currently available estimates and judgment of Conectiv's or Pepco's
management as to the expected future financial performance of Conectiv or
Pepco, as the case may be. Merrill Lynch further assumed
that the transaction will be accounted for as a purchase under generally
accepted accounting principles and that it will qualify as a tax-free
reorganization for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Merrill Lynch also assumed
that the final form of the merger agreement would be substantially similar to
the last draft reviewed by it.

   The Merrill Lynch opinion is necessarily based upon market, economic and
other conditions as they exist and can be evaluated on, and on the information
made available to Merrill Lynch as of, the date of its opinion. Merrill Lynch
assumed that in the course of obtaining the necessary regulatory or other
consents or approvals (contractual or otherwise) for the transaction, no
restrictions, including any divestiture requirements or amendments or
modifications, will be imposed that will have a material adverse effect on the
contemplated benefits of the transaction.

   Set below is a summary of the analyses performed by Merrill Lynch in
connection with the preparation of its opinion and reviewed with the Pepco
Board. These descriptions include information presented in tabular format. In
order to fully understand the financial analyses performed by Merrill Lynch,
the tables must be read together with the text of each description. The tables
alone do not constitute a complete description of the financial analyses.
Considering the data in the tables without considering the full narrative
description of the financial analyses, including the methodologies and
assumptions underlying the analyses, could create a misleading or incomplete
view of the financial analyses performed by Merrill Lynch.

 Conectiv

   Historical Stock Trading Analysis. Merrill Lynch reviewed the historical
trading prices of Conectiv common stock during the fifty-two week period
preceding January 22, 2001. The price of Conectiv common stock ranged from a
low of $13.44 on March 6, 2000 to a high of $20.75 on December 4, 2000.

   Public Comparable Companies Analysis. Merrill Lynch compared financial data
relating to Conectiv to seven publicly traded transmission and distribution
companies and to six publicly traded regional utility companies:

            Transmission and
         Distribution Companies             Regional Utility Companies
         ----------------------             --------------------------

        Consolidated Edison, Inc.  Allegheny Energy, Inc.
        Energy East Corporation    Constellation Energy Group, Inc.
        GPU, Inc.                  GPU, Inc.
        NSTAR                      Public Service Enterprise Group Incorporated
        Pepco                      Pepco
        Puget Sound Energy, Inc.   PP&L Corporation
        Sierra Pacific Resources

   These comparable companies were chosen because they are publicly traded
companies with operations that for purposes of this analysis may be considered
reasonably similar to the operations of Conectiv. For each of these comparable
companies and Conectiv, Merrill Lynch calculated market value, firm value
(which Merrill Lynch defined, for purposes of this analysis, as market value
plus short and long-term debt plus preferred stock less cash and temporary
investments), price per share of common stock as a multiple of estimated 2001
earnings and firm value as a multiple of latest twelve months or "LTM", EBITDA,
and earnings before interest and taxes (referred to as "EBIT").

   For purposes of calculating the price per share of common stock as a
multiple of estimated 2001 earnings, Merrill Lynch used the closing price per
share of each of the comparable companies' common stock on January 22, 2001 and
each of the comparable companies' estimated 2001 earnings per share or "EPS" as
reported by I/B/E/S as of January 22, 2001. The following tables set forth
information concerning the range of price per share of common stock as a
multiple of estimated earnings for 2001 and firm value as a multiple of EBITDA
and EBIT (excluding Sierra Pacific Resources with respect to Merrill Lynch's
calculations of firm value as a multiple of EBITDA and EBIT).

   Merrill Lynch calculated implied equity values per share of the comparable
companies by applying the above multiples to Conectiv EBITDA and EPS for the
year ended December 31, 2000. The following table presents the range of equity
values based on these analyses:

                                                                      Implied

   Comparable Acquisition Transactions. Using publicly available information,
Merrill Lynch analyzed information relating to the following selected
transmission and distribution industry acquisitions and integrated electric
industry acquisitions. The transactions used in the analysis were selected
because they involved the acquisition of companies that are engaged in
businesses that are reasonably similar to that of Conectiv and because such
companies have operating profiles and financial statistics that are similar to
those of Conectiv, or are valued in the public markets on a basis similar to
that of Conectiv.

   For the selected comparable transmission and distribution industry
acquisitions, Merrill Lynch calculated premium paid to market price on the date
prior to the announcement of the transaction, the ratio of offer value to LTM
EPS (as reported by I/B/E/S at the time of the announcement of each
transaction) and the ratio of transaction value to LTM EBITDA. For purposes of
calculating the mean of the ratio of offer value to LTM EPS, the National Grid
acquisition of Niagara Mohawk transaction was excluded. The following table
sets forth information concerning those analyses:

   For the selected comparable integrated electric industry acquisitions,
Merrill Lynch calculated premium paid to the market price on the date prior to
the announcement of the transaction, the ratio of offer value to LTM EPS (as
reported by I/B/E/S at the time of the announcement of each transaction) and
the ratio of transaction value to LTM EBITDA. The following table sets forth
information concerning those analyses:

                                                 Offer Value/ Transaction Value/
                                    Premium Paid     EPS            EBITDA

   Minimum.........................     0.0%         14.1             6.8

   Merrill Lynch calculated implied equity values per share of the selected
comparable acquisitions by applying the above multiples to EBITDA and EPS for
the year ended December 31, 2000 to the price of Conectiv common stock on the
announcement of the transaction and comparing the premiums paid to the price of
Conectiv common stock on the announcement of the transaction. The following
table presents the range of equity values based on these analyses:

                                                                      Implied

                                                                     Value per

   Discounted Cash Flow Analysis. Merrill Lynch also performed a discounted
cash flow analysis of Conectiv, both on a consolidated basis and for each of
its business segments. A discounted cash flow analysis is generally used to
calculate a valuation range for a company by calculating the present value of
the expected cash flows that will be generated by the company, discounted at a
rate that reflects the uncertainty of such
estimated future cash flows. Merrill Lynch utilized discount rates of 7.0% to
8.0%, 7.5% to 8.5% and 8.0% to 9.0% for different business segments of Conectiv
and on a consolidated basis and terminal multiples of fiscal year 2005 EBITDA
of 6.5x to 7.5x and 7.0x to 8.0x for different business segments of Conectiv
and on a consolidated basis.

   Merrill Lynch calculated the following implied equity values per share of
Conectiv based on the discounted cash flow analysis:

                                                                     Implied

                                                                    Value per
                                                                      Share

 Pepco

   Historical Stock Trading Analysis. Merrill Lynch reviewed the historical
trading prices of Pepco common stock during the fifty-two week period preceding
January 22, 2001. The price of Pepco common stock ranged from a low of $19.06
on March 9, 2000 to a high of $27.88 on June 29, 2000.

   Public Comparable Companies Analysis. Merrill Lynch compared certain
financial data relating to Conectiv to seven publicly traded transmission and
distribution companies and to six publicly traded regional utility companies:

            Transmission and
         Distribution Companies    Regional Utility Companies
         ----------------------    --------------------------

        Consolidated Edison, Inc.  Allegheny Energy, Inc.
        Energy East Corporation    Constellation Energy Group, Inc.
        GPU, Inc.                  GPU, Inc.

        Puget Sound Energy, Inc.   PP&L Corporation
        Sierra Pacific Resources

   These comparable companies were chosen because they are publicly traded
companies with operations that for purposes of this analysis may be considered
reasonably similar to the operations of Pepco. Merrill Lynch calculated implied
equity values per share of the comparable companies by applying the above
multiples to EBITDA and EPS for the year ended December 31, 2000. The following
table presents the range of equity values based on these analyses:

                                                                 Implied Equity

   Discounted Cash Flow Analysis. Merrill Lynch calculated the implied equity
value per share of Pepco to range from $21.50 to $28.75, based on its
discounted cash flow analysis of Pepco on a consolidated basis, utilizing
terminal multiples of fiscal year 2005 EBITDA of 7.0x to 8.0x and discount
rates of 8.0% to 9.0%.

 Exchange Ratio Analysis

   Merrill Lynch calculated implied exchange ratios from various analyses
performed by it, including the high and low trading prices of Conectiv and
Pepco common stock, implied equity value per share of public comparable
companies based on Conectiv and Pepco EBITDA and EPS for the year ended
December 31, 2000,
and the discounted cash flow analysis of Conectiv on a consolidated basis. The
following table presents the ranges of implied exchange ratios based upon these
analyses:

                                                                   Omplied

 General

   The summary set forth above of the analyses performed by Merrill Lynch in
connection with its opinion does not purport to be a complete description of
such analyses. The preparation of a fairness opinion is a complex process and
is not susceptible to partial analysis or summary description. Merrill Lynch
believes that its analyses and the summary set forth above must be considered
as a whole and that selecting portions of its analyses, without considering all
analyses, or selecting part or all of the above summary, without considering
all factors and analyses, would create an incomplete view of the process
underlying Merrill Lynch's opinion.

 Compensation Arrangements

   Merrill Lynch acted as financial advisor to the Pepco Board in connection
with the transaction. Pursuant to a letter agreement dated September 20, 2000
between Pepco and Merrill Lynch, Merrill Lynch will receive a fee from Pepco
for its services, $100,000 of which was payable upon execution of the letter
agreement, $2,250,000 of which was payable upon execution of the merger
agreement, $2,250,000 of which is contingent upon the approval of the
transaction by the holders of Pepco common stock and $4,500,000 of which is
contingent upon the completion of the transaction. Assuming completion of the
transaction, Merrill Lynch's total fee will be $9,100,000. In addition, Pepco
has agreed to reimburse Merrill Lynch for its reasonable out-of-pocket expenses
incurred in connection with rendering financial advisory services, including
the reasonable fees

and disbursements of its legal counsel. Pepco has agreed to indemnify Merrill
Lynch and its directors, officers, agents, employees and controlling persons,
for all losses, claims, damages and liabilities related to or arising out of
its rendering of services under its engagement as financial advisor, including
liabilities incurred under the federal securities laws.

   Merrill Lynch has, in the past, provided financial advisory and financing
services to Pepco and Conectiv and/or its affiliates and may continue to do so
and has received, and may receive, fees for the rendering of such services. In
addition, in the ordinary course of its business, Merrill Lynch may actively
trade shares of Conectiv stock and other securities of Conectiv, as well as
shares of Pepco common stock and other securities of Pepco, for its own account
and for accounts of customers and, accordingly, may at any time hold a long or
short position in such securities.

Conectiv Reasons for the Transaction

   The Conectiv Board believes that the transaction will join two companies
with complementary operations in the mid-Atlantic region of the United States.
With on-going utility deregulation and the increasing competitive pressures
faced by utility companies, the Conectiv Board believes that Conectiv must have
a larger customer base with increased economies of scale in order to succeed in
such a market and continue to be an efficient, low cost energy delivery company
and supplier of energy and related services. The transaction is expected to
allow Conectiv to achieve these goals and to provide substantial financial and
strategic benefits to the stockholders of Conectiv. The Conectiv Board believes
that these benefits include:

 Premium Over Market Price

  .   The consideration of $25.00 in value, subject to adjustment, for each
      share of Conectiv common stock, which represents a premium of over 30%
      over the closing sale price of $19.14 on the NYSE on February 7, 2001
      (the trading day immediately prior to the date on which the Wall Street
      Journal reported details of the negotiations between Pepco and
      Conectiv) and a premium of over 41% over the closing sale price of
      $17.69 on the NYSE on August 7, 2000 (the date which is six months
      prior to February 7, 2001).

  .   The consideration of $21.69 in value, subject to adjustment, for each
      share of Conectiv Class A common stock, which represents a premium of
      over 17% over the closing sale price of $18.41 on the NYSE on February
      7, 2001, and was determined in accordance with Conectiv's certificate
      of incorporation.

 Improved Strategic Position

  .   The combination of Conectiv and Pepco will create the largest
      electricity delivery company in the PJM Interconnection.

  .   The combined company will have a broader customer base than Conectiv as
      an independent entity and should have the size and scope to be an
      effective participant in the increasingly competitive electric and
      natural gas utility markets.

  .   Based on the 2000 results for Conectiv and Pepco, the total annual
      revenues and total annual delivered megawatts for the combined company
      will be more than $8.1 billion and 46,000 GWh, respectively. In
      addition, the combined company will serve approximately 1.8 million
      electricity and gas customers in a 10,000-square-mile service area.

  .   The combined company will have a secure energy supply with Conectiv's
      mid-merit generation capabilities and Pepco's favorable supply
      contracts.

 Financial Strength

 .   The transaction is expected to be immediately accretive to HoldCo's
     earnings.

 .   Pepco's dividend reduction will reduce the payout ratio to a similar
     level to that of Conectiv and other comparable companies, while
     permitting Conectiv stockholders to receive a higher dividend on a per
     share basis after the merger from HoldCo.

 .   Pepco will be able to internally fund its $450 million share repurchase
     program and a large portion of the cash merger consideration without
     significantly increasing the debt of the combined company.

 .   The combined company is expected to have a solid investment grade balance
     sheet, which will facilitate future growth through acquisitions or
     internal investment.

Recommendation of the Conectiv Board

   At a special meeting held on February 9, 2001, the Conectiv Board approved
the merger agreement and the transaction and determined that both are advisable
and in the best interests of Conectiv and its stockholders. Accordingly, the
Conectiv Board recommends that its stockholders vote "FOR" the adoption of the
merger agreement and the transaction.

   In approving the merger agreement and the transactions contemplated by the
merger agreement and in reaching its recommendation at the special meeting on
February 9, 2001, the Conectiv Board consulted with Conectiv's management and
legal and financial advisors. The following are the material factors considered
by the Conectiv Board, some of which contain both positive and negative
elements:

  .   the consideration of $25.00 in value, subject to adjustment, for each
      share of Conectiv common stock, which represents a premium of over 30%
      over the closing sale price on February 7, 2001 and over 41% over the
      closing sale price on August 7, 2000;

  .   the consideration of $21.69 in value, subject to adjustment, for each
      share of Conectiv Class A common stock, which represents a premium of
      over 17% over the closing sale price on February 7, 2001, and the fact
      that such consideration was determined in accordance with Conectiv's
      certificate of incorporation and that the Audit Committee recommended
      the transaction;

  .   the fact that Conectiv stockholders have the right to elect to receive
      either cash, combined company common stock or a combination of both,
      subject to proration, such that the aggregate consideration paid to all
      Conectiv stockholders will consist of 50% cash and 50% stock;

  .   the fact that the value of the stock consideration is subject to
      adjustment in the event that the Average Final Price is greater than
      $24.50 or less than $19.50;

  .   Conectiv's right to terminate the merger agreement if the Average Final
      Price is less than $16.50, unless Pepco elects to increase the value of
      the stock consideration to $21.15 per share of Conectiv common stock
      and $18.35 per share of Conectiv Class A common stock (and thereby
      increase the average value of the total consideration to $23.08 per
      share of Conectiv common stock and $20.02 per share of Conectiv Class A
      common stock);

  .   based on the number of shares currently outstanding on a fully diluted
      basis, Pepco stockholders will own approximately 67% of the common
      equity of the combined company and Conectiv stockholders will own
      approximately 33% of the common equity;

  .   Pepco's dividend reduction to $1.00 per share from $1.66 per share in
      conjunction with its authorization of a $450 million share repurchase
      program;

  .   the federal income tax consequences of the transaction to Conectiv
      stockholders;

  .   information concerning the financial condition, results of operations,
      prospects and businesses of Conectiv and Pepco, including the revenues
      of the companies and the recent stock price performance of Conectiv
      shares and Pepco shares;

  .   the effects of the changing regulatory environment and increased
      competition in the energy industry;

  .   the trend in the utility industry toward consolidation and strategic
      partnerships that create larger, stronger companies to face an
      increasingly competitive environment;

  .   other strategic options potentially available to Conectiv, including
      the prospects of positioning Conectiv for the future and enhancing
      long-term stockholder value by remaining an independent company or by
      effecting a strategic business combination with another party, and the
      impact of Conectiv's geographic location upon the availability of
      strategic partners;

  .   the recent evaluation by the Conectiv Board of the risks and benefits
      of an accelerated mid-merit strategy, which the Conectiv Board
      determined not to pursue independently in light of its belief that the
      Pepco transaction maximized stockholder value and represented the best
      transaction reasonably available to stockholders;

  .   the fact that an extensive process for reviewing strategic alternatives
      was conducted which involved contacting over 20 parties potentially
      interested in a business combination with Conectiv;

  .   the financial and business prospects for the combined company;

  .   the fact that Pepco stockholder approval is required to consummate the
      merger and the requisite vote for obtaining such approval;

  .   the likelihood of obtaining regulatory approvals for the merger in the
      current regulatory environment, including the potential impact on such
      approval of the following:

   .that Conectiv will maintain its headquarters in Wilmington, Delaware,
    and will continue to have significant operations in New Jersey and the
    Delmarva peninsula and that the combined company will have its
    headquarters in Washington, D.C.;

   .that the transaction is not expected to result in significant workforce
    reductions and that union contracts will be honored;

   .that Conectiv will continue to provide charitable contributions and
    community support in Conectiv's service territory comparable to the
    current level; and

   .that at least two members of the board of the combined company will come
    from the current Conectiv Board;

  .   the interests of certain persons in the transaction, including Mr.
      Cosgrove and other key members of Conectiv's management;

  .   the terms of the merger agreement, including the "fiduciary-out" and
      termination provisions, would not prevent the Conectiv Board from
      accepting a superior acquisition proposal, subject to paying Pepco a
      $60 million termination fee;

  .   the Conectiv Board's conclusion that the size of the termination fee,
      and the circumstances when such fee is payable, were reasonable in
      light of the benefits of the merger and the process that was conducted;

  .   the fact that Pepco would be obligated to pay Conectiv a termination
      fee of $60 million under certain circumstances;

  .   the other terms of the merger agreement, which provide for
      representations, warranties, covenants and closing conditions that are
      substantially similar to those in similar transactions;

  .   the opinion to the Conectiv Board of Credit Suisse First Boston, dated
      February 9, 2001, as to the fairness, from a financial point of view
      and as of the date of the opinion, to the holders of Conectiv common
      stock of the Conectiv common stock consideration and to the holders of
      Conectiv Class A common stock of the Conectiv Class A common stock
      consideration, as described below under the caption "Opinion of the
      Financial Advisor to Conectiv"; and

  .   the other advice from management and Conectiv's legal and financial
      advisors over an extended period, and the discussions of the Conectiv
      Board concerning the proposed merger agreement and the transactions
      contemplated thereby.

   The Conectiv Board has also considered:

  .   the risk that the benefits sought in the transaction would not be
      obtained;

  .   the risk that the transaction would not be consummated;

  .   the risk that the value of Pepco shares will decline;

  .   the effect of the public announcement of the merger on Conectiv's
      sales, customer and supplier relationships, operating results and
      ability to retain employees, and on the trading price of Conectiv
      common stock and Conectiv Class A common stock;

  .   the substantial time and effort of management that will be required to
      consummate the transaction and integrate some of the operations of the
      two companies;

  .   the impact of the transaction on Conectiv employees;

  .   the possibility that provisions of the merger agreement might have the
      effect of discouraging other persons potentially interested in a
      business combination with Conectiv from pursuing such an opportunity;
      and

  .   other matters described under "Risk Factors Relating to the
      Transaction" and "A Caution About Forward-Looking Statements."

   In the judgment of the Conectiv Board, the potential benefits of the
transaction outweigh the potential negative elements of the above-listed
considerations.

   This discussion of the information and factors considered by the Conectiv
Board is not intended to be all-inclusive. In view of the wide variety of
factors considered, the Conectiv Board did not quantify or otherwise attempt to
assign relative weights to the factors discussed above or determine that any
factor was of particular importance. Rather the Conectiv Board viewed its
position and recommendations as being based on the totality of the information
presented to and considered by it. In addition, the Conectiv Board did not
undertake to make any specific determination as to whether any particular
factor, or any aspect of any particular factor, supported or did not support
the Conectiv Board's ultimate determination to approve the transaction.
Moreover, individual members of the Conectiv Board may have given different
weight to different factors.

Opinion of the Financial Advisor to Conectiv

   Credit Suisse First Boston has acted as Conectiv's financial advisor in
connection with the transaction. Conectiv selected Credit Suisse First Boston
based on Credit Suisse First Boston's experience, expertise and reputation.
Credit Suisse First Boston is an internationally recognized investment banking
firm and is regularly engaged in the valuation of businesses and securities in
connection with mergers and acquisitions, leveraged buyouts, negotiated
underwritings, competitive biddings, secondary distributions of listed and
unlisted securities, private placements and valuations for corporate and other
purposes.

   In connection with Credit Suisse First Boston's engagement, Conectiv
requested that Credit Suisse First Boston evaluate the fairness, from a
financial point of view, to the holders of Conectiv common stock and Conectiv
Class A common stock of the consideration payable to such holders in the
Conectiv Merger. On February 9, 2001, at a meeting of the Conectiv Board held
to evaluate the transaction, Credit Suisse First Boston rendered to the
Conectiv Board an oral opinion, which opinion was confirmed by delivery of a
written opinion dated February 9, 2001, to the effect that, as of that date and
based on and subject to the matters

described in its opinion, the Conectiv common stock consideration was fair,
from a financial point of view, to the holders of Conectiv common stock and the
Conectiv Class A common stock consideration was fair, from a financial point of
view, to the holders of Conectiv Class A common stock.

   The full text of Credit Suisse First Boston's written opinion, dated
February 9, 2001, to the Conectiv Board, which sets forth, among other things,
the procedures followed, assumptions made, matters considered and limitations
on the review undertaken, is attached as Annex E and is incorporated into this
document by reference. Holders of Conectiv common stock and Conectiv Class A
common stock are urged to, and should, read this opinion carefully and in its
entirety. Credit Suisse First Boston's opinion is addressed to the Conectiv
Board and relates only to the fairness, from a financial point of view, of the
Conectiv common stock consideration and the Conectiv Class A common stock
consideration, and does not address any other aspect of the proposed
transaction or any related transaction and does not constitute a recommendation
to any stockholder as to any matter relating to the transaction. The summary of
Credit Suisse First Boston's opinion in this document is qualified in its
entirety by reference to the full text of the opinion.

   In arriving at its opinion, Credit Suisse First Boston reviewed the merger
agreement, the restated certificate of incorporation, dated March 2, 1998, of
Conectiv, and publicly available business and financial information relating to
Conectiv and Pepco. Credit Suisse First Boston also reviewed other information
relating to Conectiv and Pepco, including financial forecasts, provided to or
discussed with Credit Suisse First Boston by Conectiv and Pepco, and met with
the management of Conectiv and Pepco to discuss the businesses and prospects of
Conectiv and Pepco. Credit Suisse First Boston also considered financial and
stock market data of Conectiv and Pepco, and compared those data with similar
data for other publicly held companies in businesses similar to Conectiv and
Pepco and considered, to the extent publicly available, the financial terms of
other business combinations and transactions which have been effected or
announced. Credit Suisse First Boston also considered other information,
financial studies, analyses and investigations and financial, economic and
market criteria that it deemed relevant. In connection with its engagement,
Credit Suisse First Boston was requested to approach third parties to solicit
indications of interest in a possible acquisition of Conectiv and held
preliminary discussions with some of these parties prior to the date of the
merger agreement.

   In connection with its review, Credit Suisse First Boston did not assume any
responsibility for independent verification of any of the information that it
reviewed or considered and relied on that information being complete and
accurate in all material respects. With respect to the financial forecasts
relating to Conectiv and Pepco, Credit Suisse First Boston was advised, and
assumed, that the forecasts were reasonably prepared on bases reflecting the
best currently available estimates and judgments of the managements of Conectiv
and Pepco as to the future financial performance of Conectiv and Pepco and the
other matters covered by the forecasts. Credit Suisse First Boston also
assumed, with Conectiv's consent, that the transaction would be treated as a
tax-free reorganization for federal income tax purposes. In addition, Credit
Suisse First Boston assumed, with Conectiv's consent, that in the course of
obtaining the necessary regulatory and third party approvals and consents for
the proposed transaction, no modification, delay, limitation, restriction or
condition will be imposed that would have a material adverse effect on Conectiv
or Pepco or the contemplated benefits to Conectiv of the proposed transaction.
Credit Suisse First Boston also assumed, with Conectiv's consent, that the
transaction will be consummated in all material respects in accordance with the
terms of the merger agreement without waiver, modification or amendment. Credit
Suisse First Boston was not requested to make, and did not make, an independent
evaluation or appraisal of the assets or liabilities, contingent or otherwise,
of Conectiv or Pepco, and Credit Suisse First Boston was not furnished with any
evaluations or appraisals.

   Credit Suisse First Boston's opinion was necessarily based on information
available to it, and financial, economic, market and other conditions as they
existed and could be evaluated, on the date of Credit Suisse First Boston's
opinion. Credit Suisse First Boston did not express any opinion as to what the
value of HoldCo common stock actually will be when issued in the transaction or
the prices at which HoldCo common stock would trade at any time after the
transaction. Credit Suisse First Boston was advised, and assumed, that the

Conectiv Class A common stock consideration was determined in accordance with
the terms of Conectiv's restated certificate of incorporation governing the
Conectiv Class A common stock. In addition, Credit Suisse First Boston
expressed no opinion as to the allocation of the merger consideration between
the holders of Conectiv common stock and Conectiv Class A common stock.
Although Credit Suisse First Boston evaluated the Conectiv common stock
consideration and the Conectiv Class A common stock consideration from a
financial point of view, Credit Suisse First Boston was not requested to, and
did not, recommend the specific consideration payable in the Conectiv Merger,
which consideration was determined between Conectiv and Pepco. Credit Suisse
First Boston's opinion did not address the relative merits of the transaction
as compared to other business strategies that might have been available to
Conectiv, and also did not address the underlying business decision of Conectiv
to proceed with the transaction. Except as described above, Conectiv imposed no
other limitations on Credit Suisse First Boston with respect to the
investigations made or procedures followed in rendering its opinion.

   In preparing its opinion to the Conectiv Board, Credit Suisse First Boston
performed a variety of financial and comparative analyses, including those
described below. The summary of Credit Suisse First Boston's analyses described
below is not a complete description of the analyses underlying Credit Suisse
First Boston's opinion. The preparation of a fairness opinion is a complex
process involving various determinations as to the most appropriate and
relevant methods of financial analysis and the application of those methods to
the particular circumstances and, therefore, a fairness opinion is not readily
susceptible to partial analysis or summary description. In arriving at its
opinion, Credit Suisse First Boston made qualitative judgments as to the
significance and relevance of each analysis and factor that it considered.
Accordingly, Credit Suisse First Boston believes that its analyses must be
considered as a whole and that selecting portions of its analyses and factors
or focusing on information presented in tabular format, without considering all
analyses and factors or the narrative description of the analyses, could create
a misleading or incomplete view of the processes underlying its analyses and
opinion.

   In its analyses, Credit Suisse First Boston considered industry performance,
general business, economic, market and financial conditions and other matters,
many of which are beyond the control of Conectiv and Pepco. No company,
transaction or business used in Credit Suisse First Boston's analyses as a
comparison is identical to Conectiv, Pepco or the proposed transaction, and an
evaluation of the results of those analyses is not entirely mathematical.
Rather, the analyses involve complex considerations and judgments concerning
financial and operating characteristics and other factors that could affect the
acquisition, public trading or other values of the companies, business segments
or transactions analyzed. The estimates contained in Credit Suisse First
Boston's analyses and the ranges of valuations resulting from any particular
analysis are not necessarily indicative of actual values or predictive of
future results or values, which may be significantly more or less favorable
than those suggested by the analyses. In addition, analyses relating to the
value of businesses or securities do not purport to be appraisals or to reflect
the prices at which businesses or securities actually may be sold. Accordingly,
Credit Suisse First Boston's analyses and estimates are inherently subject to
substantial uncertainty.

   Credit Suisse First Boston's opinion and financial analyses were only one of
many factors considered by the Conectiv Board in its evaluation of the proposed
transaction and should not be viewed as determinative of the views of the
Conectiv Board or management with respect to the transaction or the merger
consideration.

   The following is a summary of the material financial analyses underlying
Credit Suisse First Boston's opinion dated February 9, 2001 delivered to the
Conectiv Board in connection with the transaction. The financial analyses
summarized below include information presented in tabular format. In order to
fully understand Credit Suisse First Boston's financial analyses, the tables
must be read together with the text of each summary. The tables alone do not
constitute a complete description of the financial analyses. Considering the
data in the tables below without considering the full narrative description of
the financial analyses, including the methodologies and assumptions underlying
the analyses, could create a misleading or incomplete view of Credit Suisse
First Boston's financial analyses.

 Introduction

   Credit Suisse First Boston performed a "Discounted Cash Flow Analysis,"
"Selected Companies Analysis" and "Selected Transactions Analysis" for each of
Conectiv and Pepco as described below. Based on these valuation methodologies,
Credit Suisse First Boston derived the following aggregate implied per share
equity reference ranges for Conectiv common stock and Conectiv Class A common
stock, as compared to the merger consideration based on the closing price of
Pepco common stock on February 9, 2001:

                                               Aggregate    Merger Consideration
                                              Implied Per     Based on Closing

      Conectiv Class A common stock........ $13.06 - $20.03        $21.69

   Based on these valuation methodologies, Credit Suisse First Boston also
derived the following aggregate implied per share equity reference range for
Pepco common stock, as compared to the closing price of Pepco common stock on
February 9, 2001:

                                               Aggregate
                                              Implied Per      Pepco Closing

                                            --------------- --------------------

      Pepco common stock................... $18.96 - $24.38        $21.35

 Conectiv

   Discounted Cash Flow Analysis. Credit Suisse First Boston estimated the
present value of the stand-alone, unlevered, after-tax free cash flows that
Conectiv could produce over 10 years. Credit Suisse First Boston performed this
analysis based on two scenarios, management case I and management case II.
Management case I and management case II were based on internal estimates of
Conectiv's management. Management case II included adjustments to management
case I to reflect, among other things, increased capital spending on generation
plants and lower capital spending on Conectiv's transmission system.

   Credit Suisse First Boston calculated a range of estimated terminal values
for Conectiv by multiplying a range of selected EBITDA multiples to Conectiv's
estimated calendar year 2011 earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and
amortization, commonly referred to as EBITDA. The estimated free cash flows and
terminal values were then discounted to present value using a range of selected
discount rates depending on the business analyzed.

   This analysis indicated an aggregate implied equity reference range for
Conectiv of approximately $1,785 million to $2,385 million, based on management
case I, and approximately $1,810 million to $2,585 million, based on management
case II. Using these aggregate equity reference ranges, Credit Suisse First
Boston then derived implied per share equity reference ranges for Conectiv
common stock and Conectiv Class A common stock under both management case I and
management case II. Under management case I, this analysis indicated implied
per share equity reference ranges for Conectiv common stock of approximately
$20.34 to $27.24 and for Conectiv Class A common stock of approximately $16.02
to $17.76. Under management case II, this analysis indicated implied per share
equity reference ranges for Conectiv common stock of approximately $20.54 to
$29.48 and for Conectiv Class A common stock of approximately $17.76 to $19.50.

   Selected Companies Analysis. Credit Suisse First Boston compared financial
and stock market data of Conectiv to corresponding financial and stock market
data for the following six publicly traded companies in the utilities industry,
specializing in energy delivery or energy generation:

  .   Public Service Enterprise Group Incorporated

  .   PPL Corporation

  .   Consolidated Edison, Inc.

  .   Constellation Energy Group, Inc.

  .   Allegheny Energy, Inc.

  .   Potomac Electric Power Company

   Credit Suisse First Boston reviewed enterprise values, calculated as equity
value, plus debt and preferred stock, less cash, as multiples of estimated
calendar year 2001 EBITDA and earnings before interest and taxes, commonly
known as EBIT. Credit Suisse First Boston also reviewed equity values as
multiples of estimated calendar year 2001 net income and book value. Credit
Suisse First Boston then applied a range of selected multiples derived from the
selected companies of estimated calendar year 2001 EBITDA, EBIT, net income and
book value to corresponding financial data of Conectiv. All multiples were
based on closing stock prices on February 7, 2001. Estimated financial data for
Conectiv were based on internal estimates of Conectiv's management and
estimated financial data for the selected companies were based on publicly
available research analysts' estimates and public filings of the selected
companies. This analysis indicated an aggregate implied equity reference range
for Conectiv of approximately $1,500 million to $2,000 million. Using this
aggregate equity reference range, Credit Suisse First Boston then derived
implied per share equity reference ranges for Conectiv common stock of
approximately $17.17 to $22.62 and for Conectiv Class A common stock of
approximately $13.06 to $20.03.

   Selected Transactions Analysis. Credit Suisse First Boston reviewed the
purchase prices and implied transaction multiples in the following 12 selected
merger and acquisition transactions in the utilities industry:

        Acquiror                                 Target
        --------                                 ------

        .  National Grid plc                     Niagara Mohawk Holdings
        .  FirstEnergy Corp.                     GPU, Inc.
        .  The AES Corporation                   IPALCO Enterprises, Inc.
        .  PowerGen plc                          LG&E Energy Corp.
        .  Private investor group                MidAmerican Energy Company
        .  Consolidated Edison, Inc.             Northeast Utilities
        .  Carolina Power & Light Company        Florida Progress Corporation
        .  Energy East Corporation               CMP Group, Inc.
        .  Private investor group                TNP Enterprises, Inc.
        .  New England Electric Resources, Inc.  Eastern Utilities Associates
        .  The AES Corporation                   CILCORP Inc.
        .  Consolidated Edison, Inc.             Orange & Rockland Utilities, Inc.

   Credit Suisse First Boston compared enterprise values in the selected
transactions as multiples of latest 12 months EBITDA and EBIT. Credit Suisse
First Boston also compared equity values in the selected transactions as
multiples of latest 12 months net income and book value. Credit Suisse First
Boston then applied a range of selected multiples derived from the selected
transactions of latest 12 months EBITDA, EBIT, net income and book value to
corresponding financial data of Conectiv. All multiples for the selected
transactions were based on publicly available information at the time of
announcement of the relevant transaction. Financial data for Conectiv were
based on 2000 actual results provided by Conectiv's management. This analysis
indicated an aggregate implied equity reference range for Conectiv of
approximately $1,900

million to $2,400 million. Using this aggregate equity reference range, Credit
Suisse First Boston then derived implied per share equity reference ranges for
Conectiv common stock of approximately $22.08 to $27.45 and for Conectiv Class
A common stock of approximately $10.45 to $17.41.

 Pepco

   Discounted Cash Flow Analysis. Credit Suisse First Boston estimated the
present value of the stand-alone, unlevered, after-tax free cash flows that
Pepco could produce over five years, based on two scenarios, management case I
and management case II. Management case I and management case II were based on
internal estimates of Pepco's management. Management case II included
adjustments to management case I to reflect, among other things, the potential
for reductions in revenue growth in various segments of Pepco's businesses.
This analysis excluded Pepco's interest in Potomac Capital Investment
Corporation, which consists primarily of financial investments and equity
interests in telecommunications businesses, which Credit Suisse First Boston
evaluated on a book value multiple basis.

   Credit Suisse First Boston calculated a range of estimated terminal values
for Pepco by multiplying a range of selected EBITDA multiples to Pepco's
estimated calendar year 2005 EBITDA. The estimated free cash flows and terminal
values were then discounted to present value using a range of selected discount
rates depending on the business analyzed.

   This analysis indicated an aggregate implied equity reference range for
Pepco of approximately $2,480 million to $3,280 million, based on management
case I, and approximately $2,040 million to $2,740 million, based on management
case II. Using these aggregate equity reference ranges, Credit Suisse First
Boston then derived implied per share equity reference ranges for Potomac
common stock under both management case I and management case II. Under
management case I, this analysis indicated an implied per share equity
reference range for Pepco common stock of approximately $22.38 to $29.66. Under
management case II, this analysis indicated an implied per share equity
reference range for Pepco common stock of approximately $18.41 to $24.78.

   Selected Companies Analysis. Credit Suisse First Boston compared financial
and stock market data of Pepco to corresponding data for the following four
publicly traded companies in the utilities industry, specializing in energy
delivery:

  .  Conectiv

  .  Consolidated Edison, Inc.

  .  NSTAR

  .  DQE, Inc.

   Credit Suisse First Boston reviewed enterprise values as multiples of
estimated calendar year 2001 EBITDA and EBIT. Credit Suisse First Boston also
reviewed equity values as multiples of estimated calendar year 2001 net income
and book value. Credit Suisse First Boston then applied a range of selected
multiples derived from the selected companies of estimated calendar year 2001
EBITDA, EBIT, net income and book value to corresponding financial data of
Pepco. All multiples were based on closing stock prices on February 7, 2001.
Estimated financial data for Pepco were based on internal estimates of Pepco's
management and estimated financial data for the selected companies were based
on publicly available research analysts' estimates and public filings of the
selected companies. This analysis indicated an aggregate implied equity
reference range for Pepco of approximately $2,100 million to $2,500 million.
Using this aggregate equity reference range, Credit Suisse First Boston then
derived a per share equity reference range for Pepco common stock of
approximately $18.96 to $22.57.

   Selected Transactions Analysis. Credit Suisse First Boston also performed a
selected transactions analysis for Pepco in which Credit Suisse First Boston
applied to Pepco's estimated calendar year 2001

EBITDA, EBIT, net income and book value the range of selected multiples of
latest 12 months EBITDA, EBIT, net income and book value derived from the
selected transactions in the utilities industry which it reviewed for Conectiv.
All multiples were based on financial information available at the time of the
relevant transaction. Estimated financial data for Pepco were based on internal
estimates of Pepco's management. This analysis indicated an aggregate implied
equity reference range for Pepco of approximately $2,400 million to $2,900
million. Using this aggregate equity reference range, Credit Suisse First
Boston then derived an implied per share equity reference range for Pepco
common stock of approximately $21.67 to $26.18.

   Other Factors. In the course of preparing its opinion, Credit Suisse First
Boston also reviewed and considered other information and data, including:

  .  the 52 week price performance of Conectiv common stock, Conectiv Class A
     common stock and Pepco common stock;

  .  the potential pro forma financial impact of the transaction of Pepco's
     estimated calendar years 2002 and 2003 earnings per share; and

  .  the premiums for Conectiv common stock and Conectiv Class A common stock
     implied by the Conectiv common stock consideration and the Conectiv
     Class A common stock consideration over various periods prior to public
     announcement of the transaction.

   Miscellaneous. Conectiv has agreed to pay Credit Suisse First Boston for its
financial advisory services in connection with the transaction an aggregate fee
of approximately $19.8 million, a significant portion of which is contingent
upon completion of the transaction. Conectiv also has agreed to reimburse
Credit Suisse First Boston for its out-of-pocket expenses, including fees and
expenses of legal counsel and any other advisor retained by Credit Suisse First
Boston, and to indemnify Credit Suisse First Boston and related parties against
liabilities, including liabilities under the federal securities laws, arising
out of its engagement.

   Credit Suisse First Boston and its affiliates in the past have provided
financial services to Conectiv unrelated to the proposed transaction, for which
services Credit Suisse First Boston and its affiliates have received
compensation. In the ordinary course of business, Credit Suisse First Boston
and its affiliates may actively trade the debt and equity securities of
Conectiv and Pepco for their own accounts and for the accounts of customers
and, accordingly, may at any time hold long or short positions in those
securities.

Dissenters' Appraisal Rights

   General. Pepco stockholders have dissenters' appraisal rights under the
corporate laws of the District of Columbia and Virginia and Conectiv
stockholders have dissenters' appraisal rights under the corporate law of
Delaware, as summarized below. In view of the complexity of these provisions of
the District of Columbia, Virginia and Delaware corporate law, any Pepco or
Conectiv stockholder who is considering exercising dissenters' appraisal rights
may wish to consult a legal advisor.

   Appraisal Rights of Dissenting Stockholders of Pepco. Dissenters' appraisal
rights are available to holders of Pepco common stock and Pepco preferred stock
under applicable District of Columbia and Virginia law, as set forth below.
Where applicable, Pepco will recognize dissenters' appraisal rights that are
perfected under either District of Columbia or Virginia law.

   District of Columbia. Section 29-373 of the District of Columbia Business
Corporation Act provides dissenters' rights for the holders of Pepco common and
preferred stock who object to the transaction and meet the statutory
requirements contained therein. To perfect this right, a record stockholder
must:

     (1) deliver to Pepco written objection to the transaction prior to or at
  the first of the Pepco meetings before the vote is taken;

     (2) not vote in favor of the transaction; and

     (3) within 20 days after the effective time, make a written demand on
  HoldCo for payment of the fair value of his or her shares as of the day
  prior to the date on which the vote was taken approving the transaction.

The written notice of objection to the transaction should be sent or delivered
to:

     Potomac Electric Power Company
     Attention: Corporate Secretary
     1900 Pennsylvania Avenue, N.W.
     Washington, D.C. 20068
     Telephone (202) 872-3256

The failure to vote against the transaction will not constitute a waiver of
dissenters' appraisal rights and a vote against the transaction will not
satisfy the notice requirement. Any stockholder failing to make demand within
the 20-day period will be bound by the terms of the merger agreement.

   If within 30 days after the effective time, the value of the shares is
agreed upon between the dissenting stockholder and HoldCo, payment will be made
upon surrender of the certificate or certificates representing the shares. If
within the 30-day period the dissenting stockholder and HoldCo do not agree as
to the value of the shares, the dissenting stockholder may, within 60 days
after the expiration of the 30-day period, file a petition in any court of
competent jurisdiction within the District of Columbia, asking for a finding
and determination of the fair value of the shares. The dissenting stockholder
will be entitled to judgment against HoldCo for the amount of the fair value as
of the day prior to the date on which the vote was taken approving the
transaction, together with interest at an annual rate of 5% to the date of the
judgment. Unless the dissenting stockholder files the petition within the
requisite period, the stockholder will be bound by the terms of the merger
agreement.

   The full text of the dissenters' appraisal provisions of District of
Columbia law is attached to this joint proxy statement/prospectus as Annex F.

   Virginia. The Virginia Stock Corporation Act (or the VSCA) provides
dissenters' appraisal rights of holders of shares of Pepco common stock and
Pepco preferred stock who object to the transaction and follow the procedures
required to perfect such rights set forth in Article 15 of the VSCA, which
governs dissenters' appraisal rights. A beneficial holder of Pepco stock as of
the Pepco Record Date may assert dissenters' appraisal rights with respect to
shares held on his or her behalf only if he or she submits to Pepco the record
holder's written consent to the dissent not later than the time the beneficial
holder asserts such rights. A record holder of Pepco stock as of the Pepco
Record Date may assert dissenters' appraisal rights with respect to fewer than
all shares registered in its name if it notifies Pepco in writing of the name
and address of each beneficial owner of shares on whose behalf it is asserting
dissenters' appraisal rights and asserts such rights with respect to all shares
beneficially owned by such person.

   In order to assert dissenters' rights, a stockholder must:

     (1) deliver to Pepco prior to the vote on the transaction written notice
  of his intent to demand payment for his shares if the transaction is
  effectuated; and

     (2) not vote in favor of the transaction.

Such notice of intent should be sent or delivered to:

     Potomac Electric Power Company
     Attention: Corporate Secretary
     1900 Pennsylvania Avenue, N.W.
     Washington, D.C. 20068
     Telephone (202) 872-3256

   A stockholder who votes for the transaction or who does not satisfy each of
these requirements is not entitled to payment for his shares under the
dissenters' appraisal rights provisions of the VSCA. The failure to vote
against the transaction will not constitute a waiver of dissenters' appraisal
rights, and a vote against the transaction will not satisfy the notice
requirement.

   Within 10 days after the consummation of the transaction, HoldCo is required
to deliver to each stockholder who has asserted dissenters' appraisal rights a
notice that:

     (1) states where the stockholder's demand for payment should be sent and
  where certificates for shares should be deposited;

     (2) supplies a form for demanding payment that includes the date of the
  first announcement to the news media of the terms of the transaction and
  requires the stockholder to certify whether he acquired beneficial
  ownership of the shares before or after that date; and

     (3) sets a date by which HoldCo must receive the demand for payment,
  which may not be more than 60 nor fewer than 30 days after the date of
  delivery of the notice.

   Upon receipt of the notice, a stockholder must demand payment, certify that
he acquired his shares before or after the announcement date, and deposit his
shares in accordance with the terms of the notice. A stockholder who does not
satisfy each of these requirements is not entitled to payment for his shares
under the dissenters' rights provisions of the VSCA.

   Section 13.1-737 of the VSCA provides that, except in the case of shares
acquired after the announcement date, within 30 days after the receipt of a
valid payment demand, HoldCo is obligated to pay the dissenter the amount
HoldCo estimates to be the fair value of his shares, plus accrued interest from
the effective time to the date of payment. "Fair value" means the value of a
dissenter's shares immediately before the effectuation of the transaction,
excluding any appreciation or depreciation in anticipation of the transaction
unless such exclusion would be inequitable. Interest is calculated generally at
the average rate then currently paid by HoldCo on its principal bank loans.
This payment obligation may be enforced by the circuit court in the city or
county where HoldCo's registered office is located or, at the election of any
dissenter residing or having its principal office in Virginia, by the circuit
court in the city or county where the dissenter resides or has its principal
office.

   HoldCo may elect to withhold payment on after-acquired shares. To the extent
that HoldCo elects to withhold this payment, after consummating the
transaction, HoldCo is required to estimate the fair value of the shares, plus
accrued interest, and offer to pay this amount to each dissenter who agrees to
accept it in full satisfaction of his demand.

   Section 13.1-738 of the VSCA provides that a dissenter may notify HoldCo in
writing of his own estimate of the fair value of his shares and amount of
interest due, and demand payment of his estimate less any payment made by
HoldCo under Section 13.1-737 or reject HoldCo's offer under Section 13.1-738
and demand payment of the fair value of his shares and interest due, if the
dissenter believes that the amount paid under Section 13.1-737 or offered under
Section 13.1-738 is less than the fair value of his shares or that the interest
due is incorrectly calculated. A dissenter waives his right to demand payment
under Section 13.1-739 unless he notifies HoldCo of his demand in writing
within 30 days after HoldCo made or offered payment for his shares. If any such
demand for payment remains unsettled, HoldCo is required to commence a
proceeding within 60 days after receiving the payment demand in the circuit
court to determine the fair value of the shares and accrued interest. If HoldCo
does not commence the proceeding within the 60-day period, it is required to
pay each dissenter whose demand remains unsettled the amount demanded. In this
proceeding, the dissenter is entitled to judgment for:

     (1) the amount, if any, by which the court finds that the fair value of
  his shares plus interest, exceeds the amount paid by HoldCo under Section
  13.1-737 of the VSCA; or

     (2) the fair value, plus accrued interest, of his after-acquired shares
  for which HoldCo elected to withhold payment under Section 13.1-738 of the
  VSCA.

   Appraisal Rights of Dissenting Stockholders of Conectiv. Appraisal rights
are available to dissenting holders of Conectiv common stock and Conectiv Class
A common stock under the laws of the State of Delaware.

   If the transaction is consummated, a holder of record of Conectiv stock on
the date of making a demand for appraisal, as described below, will be entitled
to have those shares appraised by the Delaware Court of Chancery under Section
262 of the Delaware General Corporation Law (or the DGCL) and to receive
payment for the "fair value" of those shares instead of the consideration
provided for in the merger agreement. In order to be eligible to receive this
payment, however, a Conectiv stockholder must:

     (1) continue to hold his or her shares through the time of the
  transaction;

     (2) strictly comply with the procedures discussed under Section 262 of
  the DGCL; and

     (3) not vote in favor of the transaction.

   This joint proxy statement/prospectus is being sent to all holders of record
of Conectiv stock on the record date for the Conectiv meeting and constitutes
notice of the appraisal rights available to those holders under Section 262.

   The following summary is not a complete statement of Section 262 of the
DGCL, and is qualified in its entirety by reference to Section 262 of the DGCL,
which is incorporated herein by reference, together with any amendments to the
laws that may be adopted after the date of this joint proxy
statement/prospectus.

   A holder of Conectiv stock who elects to exercise appraisal rights under
Section 262 of the DGCL must deliver a written demand for appraisal of its
shares of Conectiv stock prior to the vote on the transaction. The written
demand must identify the stockholder of record and state the stockholder's
intention to demand appraisal of his or her shares. All demands should be
delivered to:

     Conectiv
     Attention: Secretary
     800 King Street
     Wilmington, Delaware 19801
     Telephone (302) 429-3069

   Only a holder of shares of Conectiv stock on the date of making a written
demand for appraisal who continuously holds those shares through the time of
the transaction is entitled to seek appraisal. Demand for appraisal must be
executed by or for the holder of record, fully and correctly, as that holder's
name appears on the holder's stock certificates representing shares of Conectiv
stock. If Conectiv stock is owned of record in a fiduciary capacity by a
trustee, guardian or custodian, the demand should be made in that capacity. If
Conectiv stock is owned of record by more than one person, as in a joint
tenancy or tenancy in common, the demand should be made by or for all owners of
record. An authorized agent, including one or more joint owners, may execute
the demand for appraisal for a holder of record; however, that agent must
identify the record owner or owners and expressly disclose in the demand that
the agent is acting as agent for the record owner or owners of the shares.

   A record holder such as a broker who holds shares of Conectiv stock as a
nominee for beneficial owners, some of whom desire to demand appraisal, must
exercise appraisal rights on behalf of those beneficial owners with respect to
the shares of Conectiv stock, held for those beneficial owners. In that case,
the written demand

for appraisal should state the number of shares of Conectiv stock covered by
it. Unless a demand for appraisal specifies a number of shares, the demand will
be presumed to cover all shares of Conectiv stock held in the name of the
record owner.

   Beneficial owners who are not record owners and who intend to exercise
appraisal rights should instruct the record owner to comply with the statutory
requirements with respect to the exercise of appraisal rights before the date
of the Conectiv meeting.

   Within 10 days after the effective time, the surviving or resulting
corporation is required to send notice of the effectiveness of the transaction
to each stockholder who prior to the time of the transaction complies with the
requirements of Section 262 of the DGCL.

   Within 120 days after the effective date, the surviving or resulting
corporation or any stockholder who has complied with the requirements of
Section 262 of the DGCL may file a petition in the Delaware Court of Chancery
demanding a determination of the fair value of the shares of Conectiv stock
held by all stockholders seeking appraisal. A dissenting stockholder must serve
a copy of the petition on the surviving or resulting corporation. If no
petition is filed by the surviving corporation, the resulting corporation or
any dissenting stockholder within the 120-day period, the rights of all
dissenting stockholders to appraisal will cease. Stockholders seeking to
exercise appraisal rights should not assume that the surviving or resulting
corporation will file a petition with respect to the appraisal of the fair
value of their shares or that the surviving or resulting corporation will
initiate any negotiations with respect to the fair value of those shares.
Conectiv (as the surviving corporation in the Conectiv Merger) has no
obligation, and has no present intention, to take any action in this regard.
Accordingly, stockholders who wish to seek appraisal of their shares should
initiate all necessary action with respect to the perfection of their appraisal
rights within the time periods and in the manner prescribed in Section 262 of
the DGCL. Failure to file the petition on a timely basis will cause the
stockholder's right to an appraisal to cease.

   Within 120 days after the effective time, any stockholder who has complied
with subsections (a) and (d) of Section 262 of the DGCL is entitled, upon
written request, to receive from the surviving or resulting corporation a
statement setting forth the total number of shares of Conectiv stock not voted
in favor of the transaction with respect to which demands for appraisal have
been received by Conectiv and the number of holders of those shares. The
statement must be mailed within 10 days after Conectiv has received the written
request or within 10 days after the time for delivery of demands for appraisal
under subsection (d) of Section 262 has expired, whichever is later.

   If a petition for an appraisal is filed in a timely manner, at the hearing
on the petition, the Delaware Court of Chancery will determine which
stockholders are entitled to appraisal rights and will appraise the shares of
Conectiv stock owned by those stockholders. The court will determine the fair
value of those shares, exclusive of any element of value arising from the
accomplishment or expectation of the transaction, together with a fair rate of
interest, to be paid, if any, upon the fair value.

   Stockholders who consider seeking appraisal should consider that the fair
value of their shares under Section 262 of the DGCL could be more than, the
same as, or less than, the value of the consideration provided for in the
merger agreement without the exercise of appraisal rights. The Court of
Chancery may determine the cost of the appraisal proceeding and assess it
against the parties as the Court deems equitable. Upon application of a
dissenting stockholder, the Court may order that all or a portion of the
expenses incurred by any dissenting stockholder in connection with the
appraisal proceeding (including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys' fees
and the fees and expenses of experts) be charged pro rata against the value of
all shares of Conectiv stock entitled to appraisal. In the absence of a court
determination or assessment, each party bears its own expenses.

   Any stockholder who has demanded appraisal for his or her stock in
compliance with Section 262 of the DGCL will not, after the transaction, be
entitled to vote that stock for any purpose or receive payment of dividends or
other distributions, if any, on that stock, except for payment of dividends or
distributions, if any,

payable to stockholders of record at a date prior to the transaction. A
stockholder may withdraw a demand for appraisal and accept the HoldCo common
stock at any time within 60 days after the effective time. If an appraisal
proceeding is properly instituted, it may not be dismissed as to any
stockholder without the approval of the Delaware Court of Chancery, and any
such approval may be conditioned on the Court of Chancery's deeming the terms
to be just. If, after the transaction, a holder of Conectiv stock who had
demanded appraisal for his shares fails to perfect or loses his right to
appraisal, those shares will be treated under the merger agreement as if they
were converted into HoldCo common stock at the time of the transaction.

   The full text of the dissenters' appraisal provisions of Delaware law is
attached to this joint proxy statement/prospectus as Annex H.

Accounting Treatment of the Transaction

   The transaction will be accounted for by HoldCo using the purchase method of
accounting for a business combination in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles. Under this method of accounting, the assets and
liabilities of Conectiv will be recorded at their fair values and if necessary,
any excess of the merger consideration over those amounts will be recorded as
goodwill. The results of operations and cash flows of Conectiv will be included
in HoldCo's financial statements prospectively as of the completion of the
transaction.

Restrictions on Resales by Pepco and Conectiv Affiliates

   HoldCo has registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (or the
Securities Act) the shares of HoldCo common stock to be received by Pepco's and
Conectiv's stockholders in connection with the transaction. When HoldCo shares
are issued to Pepco's and Conectiv's stockholders, these stockholders may trade
them without restriction unless they are deemed to be an "affiliate" of Pepco
or Conectiv, as defined in the rules promulgated under the Securities Act.

   The shares of HoldCo common stock received by persons who are deemed to be
affiliates of either Pepco or Conectiv before the transaction may be resold by
them only in transactions permitted by the resale provisions of Rule 145 under
the Securities Act. Shares of HoldCo common stock received by persons who are
deemed to be affiliates of HoldCo after the transaction may be sold by them
only in transactions permitted under the provisions of Rule 144 under the
Securities Act, or as otherwise permitted under the Securities Act.

   For purposes of Rule 145 under the Securities Act, Pepco and Conectiv have
agreed to use their commercially reasonable efforts to cause each person who is
an affiliate of either Pepco or Conectiv to deliver to HoldCo a written
agreement intended to ensure compliance with the Securities Act.

Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences

   The following summary discusses the material U.S. federal income tax
consequences of the transaction to U.S. Holders of Pepco stock and Conectiv
stock.

   For purposes of this discussion, a U.S. Holder means:

 .  a citizen or resident of the United States;

 .  a corporation or other entity taxable as a corporation created or organized
   under the laws of the United States or any of its political subdivisions;

 .  a trust, if a U.S. court is able to exercise primary supervision over the
   administration of the trust and one or more U.S. fiduciaries have the
   authority to control all substantial decisions of the trust; or

 .  an estate that is subject to U.S. federal income tax on its income
   regardless of its source.

   This discussion is based upon the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended,
Treasury regulations, administrative rulings and judicial decisions currently
in effect, all of which are subject to change, possibly with retroactive
effect. The discussion assumes that Pepco stockholders hold their Pepco stock
and will hold their HoldCo common stock, and Conectiv stockholders hold their
Conectiv stock and will hold their HoldCo common stock, as a capital asset
within the meaning of Section 1221 of the Internal Revenue Code. Further, the
discussion addresses only the material U.S. federal income tax consequences of
the transaction and does not consider the effect of any foreign, state, local
or other tax law. Nor does the discussion address all aspects of U.S. federal
income taxation that may be relevant to a particular stockholder in light of
that stockholder's personal investment circumstances, or to stockholders
subject to special treatment under the U.S. federal income tax laws, including:

 .  insurance companies;

 .  tax-exempt organizations;

 .  financial institutions;

 .  broker-dealers;

 .  persons who have elected to use the mark-to-market method of accounting with
   respect to their securities holdings;

 .  persons that hold their Pepco stock or Conectiv stock as part of a straddle,
   a hedge against currency risk or a constructive sale or conversion
   transaction;

 .  persons that have a functional currency other than the U.S. dollar;

 .  investors in pass-through entities;

 .  persons who acquired their Pepco stock or Conectiv stock through the
   exercise of employee stock options or otherwise as compensation or through a
   tax-qualified retirement plan; or

 .  holders of options granted under any Pepco or Conectiv benefit plan.

   Holders of Pepco stock and Conectiv stock should consult their own tax
advisors regarding the specific tax consequences to them of the transaction,
including the applicability and effect of federal, state, local and foreign
income and other tax laws in their particular circumstances.

   In connection with the filing of this joint proxy statement/prospectus,
Simpson Thacher & Bartlett, counsel to Conectiv, and LeBoeuf, Lamb, Greene &
MacRae, L.L.P., counsel to Pepco, have delivered their opinions to Pepco and
Conectiv, respectively, to the effect that the statements made under the
heading "The Transaction--Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences--
Consequences of the Transaction to U.S. Holders," to the extent they constitute
statements of law or legal conclusions, are correct in all material respects.

   The tax opinions are subject to qualifications and are based on currently
applicable law, certain factual representations made by HoldCo, Pepco and
Conectiv and certain customary assumptions. The tax opinions are not binding on
the Internal Revenue Service or any courts and there can be no assurance that
the Internal Revenue Service or a court will agree with any of the conclusions
described below. Moreover, any change in currently applicable law, which may or
may not be retroactive, or failure of any of such factual representations or
assumptions to be true, correct and complete in all material respects, could
affect the continuing validity of the tax opinions.

 Consequences of the Transaction to U.S. Holders

   The material U.S. federal income tax consequences of the transaction to the
U.S. Holders of Pepco stock and Conectiv stock are summarized as follows:

 .  the Pepco Merger and the Conectiv Merger, taken together, will be treated
   for U.S. federal income tax purposes as transactions described in Section
   351 of the Internal Revenue Code;

 .  with respect to U.S. Holders of Pepco common stock:

  .  no gain or loss will be recognized on the exchange of Pepco common stock
     solely for HoldCo common stock pursuant to the Pepco Merger;

  .  the aggregate adjusted basis of the HoldCo common stock received in the
     Pepco Merger will be equal to the aggregate adjusted tax basis of the
     Pepco common stock exchanged for that HoldCo common stock, reduced by
     any amount allocable to the fractional share interests in HoldCo common
     stock for which cash is received;

  .  the holding period of the HoldCo common stock received in the Pepco
     Merger will include the holding period of the Pepco common stock
     exchanged for that HoldCo common stock;

 .  with respect to U.S. Holders of Conectiv stock:

  .  no gain or loss will be recognized on the exchange of Conectiv stock
     solely for HoldCo common stock pursuant to the Conectiv Merger, except
     with respect to cash received instead of fractional shares of HoldCo
     common stock;

  .  gain or loss will be recognized on the exchange of Conectiv stock solely
     for cash pursuant to the Conectiv Merger in an amount equal to the
     difference between the amount of cash received and the U.S. Holder's
     adjusted tax basis in those shares of Conectiv stock;

  .  gain (but not loss) will be recognized on the exchange of Conectiv stock
     for a combination of cash and HoldCo common stock pursuant to the
     Conectiv Merger equal to the difference between:

    .  the sum of the cash (excluding any cash received instead of
       fractional shares of HoldCo common stock) and the fair market value
       of the HoldCo common stock received (including any fractional shares
       of HoldCo common stock deemed received and exchanged for cash), and

    .  the U.S. Holder's adjusted tax basis in those shares of Conectiv
       stock,

     but not in excess of the cash received by such U.S. Holder in the
  Conectiv Merger;

  .  the aggregate adjusted basis of the HoldCo common stock received in the
     Conectiv Merger (including any fractional shares of HoldCo common stock
     deemed received and exchanged for cash) will be equal to the aggregate
     adjusted tax basis of the Conectiv stock exchanged in the Conectiv
     Merger, increased by the amount of gain, if any, recognized by such U.S.
     Holder and decreased by the amount of cash received;

  .  the holding period of the HoldCo common stock received in the Conectiv
     Merger will include the holding period of the Conectiv stock exchanged
     for that HoldCo common stock; and

 .  with respect to U.S. Holders of Pepco preferred stock, no gain or loss will
   be recognized by a U.S. Holder who retains Pepco preferred stock in
   connection with the Pepco Merger.

 Cash Instead of Fractional Shares

   The receipt of cash instead of a fractional share of HoldCo common stock by
a U.S. Holder of Conectiv stock will result in taxable gain or loss to such
U.S. Holder for U.S. federal income tax purposes based upon the difference
between the amount of cash received by such U.S. Holder and the U.S. Holder's
adjusted tax basis in the fractional share (determined as described above).

 Dissenters' Appraisal Rights

   A U.S. Holder of Pepco stock or Conectiv stock who exercises dissenters'
appraisal rights as described above under "The Transaction--Dissenters'
Appraisal Rights", generally will be treated as if the shares of

stock subject to such rights were redeemed by Pepco or Conectiv, as applicable.
In that case, the U.S. Holder generally will recognize capital gain or loss for
U.S. federal income tax purposes equal to the difference between the tax basis
of the stock with respect to which such rights are exercised and the amount
received through the exercise of such rights, provided that such U.S. Holder
does not own directly or constructively any Pepco stock following the Pepco
Merger or any Conectiv stock following the Conectiv Merger. For this purpose, a
U.S. Holder of Pepco stock or Conectiv stock may be treated as owning stock
owned by certain related individuals and entities and stock which such U.S.
Holder has the right to acquire by exercise of an option.

   U.S. Holders of Pepco stock or Conectiv stock who actually or constructively
own Pepco stock or Conectiv stock following the Pepco Merger or the Conectiv
Merger, respectively, should consult their tax advisors to determine the tax
consequences to them resulting from the exercise of their dissenters' appraisal
rights.

 Taxation of Capital Gain

   Gain or loss recognized by a U.S. Holder in connection with the mergers will
constitute capital gain or loss and will constitute long-term capital gain or
loss if the U.S. Holder's holding period is greater than one year as of the
date of the mergers. For non-corporate U.S. Holders, this long-term capital
gain generally will be taxed at a maximum U.S. federal income tax rate of 20%.
The deductibility of capital losses is subject to limits.

 Backup Withholding

   Payments to certain non-corporate U.S. Holders may be subject to backup
withholding at a 31% rate on cash payments received in connection with the
mergers (including cash paid instead of fractional shares of HoldCo common
stock). Backup withholding will not apply, however, to a U.S. Holder who:

 .  furnishes a correct taxpayer identification number and certifies as to not
   being subject to backup withholding on IRS Form W- 9 or a substitute or
   successor form; or

 .  is otherwise exempt from backup withholding.

   If a U.S. Holder does not provide a correct taxpayer identification number,
such U.S. Holder may be subject to penalties imposed by the Internal Revenue
Service. Any amount paid as backup withholding does not constitute an
additional tax and will be creditable against such U.S. Holder's U.S. federal
income tax liability. U.S. Holders should consult with their own tax advisors
as to their qualification for exemption from backup withholding and the
procedure for obtaining the exemption.

   A U.S. Holder may avoid backup withholding by completing IRS Form W- 9 or a
substitute or successor form and submitting it to the paying agent for the
transaction when submitting such U.S. Holder's stock certificates.

 Reporting Requirements

   U.S. Holders of Pepco common stock or Conectiv stock receiving HoldCo common
stock as a result of the mergers will be required to attach to their income tax
returns for the taxable year in which the closing of the transaction occurs,
and maintain a permanent record of, a complete statement of all the facts
relating to the exchange of stock in connection with the transaction. The facts
to be disclosed by a U.S. Holder include the U.S. Holder's basis in the Pepco
common stock or the Conectiv stock, as the case may be, transferred to HoldCo
and the number of shares of HoldCo common stock received in the transaction.

Interests of Certain Persons in the Transaction

   Pepco

   In considering the recommendation of the Pepco Board, you should be aware
that certain of Pepco's directors and officers may be deemed to have interests
in the transaction that are or may be different from, or in addition to, your
interests as a stockholder. The Pepco Board was aware of these interests and
considered them, among other matters, in approving the merger agreement and
recommending it for your approval.

   Severance Agreements. Pepco has entered into severance agreements with Mr.
Andrew W. Williams, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Mr.
William J. Sim, Senior Vice President, Power Delivery, and several other
officers and general managers of Pepco, each of which contains change in
control provisions. Completion of the transaction would constitute a change in
control under each of these agreements. The agreements provide for the payment
of severance benefits if, within two years following a change in control, an
employee's employment is terminated by Pepco other than for cause, death, or
disability, an employee terminates employment for "good reason," a successor
company does not assume Pepco's obligations under the agreements, or Pepco or a
successor materially breaches the agreement. Severance benefits are also made
under the agreements if, in contemplation of, but prior to, a change in
control, Pepco terminates an employee's employment without cause or an employee
terminates for "good reason." Good reason is defined as the assignment of
duties materially inconsistent with the employee's duties before a change in
control or a material reduction in the employee's duties or responsibilities, a
reduction in base salary, or a relocation of the employee's office by more than
50 miles.

   Severance payments consist of (1) twenty-four equal monthly payments that
together equal two times the employee's annual base salary in effect at the
time of the termination of employment and two times the average target annual
bonuses received by the employee during the three years prior to the change in
control, and (2) the continuation of welfare benefits for a three-year period
after the date of termination. The agreements also provide for additional
payments, if required, to make the employees whole for any excise tax imposed
under Section 4999 of the Internal Revenue Code.

   Long-Term Incentive Plan. Pepco's long-term incentive plan, under which
stock options, restricted stock and other forms of stock-based awards may be
granted to officers, key employees, and directors of Pepco, including Pepco's
directors and Messrs. Derrick, Wraase, Torgerson, Williams, and Sim, contains
change in control provisions. Stockholder approval of the transaction would
constitute a change in control for purposes of the plan. Under the plan's
change in control provisions, participants are entitled to accelerated vesting
or payout of awards if their employment or service on the Pepco Board is
terminated or if they suffer a diminution of responsibility, authority,
position or salary following a change in control. In addition, each "incentive
stock option agreement" awarded under the plan allows the Pepco Board to
accelerate vesting following a proposal to merge or consolidate Pepco with
another company if such merger or consolidation is submitted to Pepco's
stockholders for a vote.

   Other Arrangements Affected by the Transaction. Under various employee plans
of Pepco, the transaction will constitute a change in control, which will
entitle participating employees, including those executives named above, to
benefits if their employment is terminated following the transaction. Under
Pepco's supplemental executive retirement plan and Pepco's executive
performance supplemental retirement plan, officers will be entitled to
accelerated payment of retirement benefits. Under Pepco's executive split-
dollar program, executive officers and other employees will be entitled to
continuation of premium payments.

   In addition, the transaction will require Pepco to fund a trust established
for the payment of benefits that are payable under Pepco's supplemental
executive retirement plan and Pepco's director and executive deferred
compensation plan, and a payment default following the transaction will require
the funding of a second trust established for the payment of benefits payable
under Pepco's supplemental benefit program, Pepco's executive

performance supplemental retirement plan, and Pepco's executive split-dollar
insurance program. Finally, under Pepco's director and executive deferred
compensation plan, in the event of a change in control, which would include
stockholder approval of the transaction, and termination of a participant's
employment, a lump sum payment will be made equal to the net present value of
the expected payments at age 65 discounted using the Pension Benefit Guaranty
Corporation immediate payment interest rate plus one-half of one percent.

   Conectiv

   In considering the recommendation of the Conectiv Board, you should be aware
that certain of Conectiv's directors and officers may be deemed to have
interests in the transaction that are or may be different from, or in addition
to, your interests as a stockholder. The Conectiv Board was aware of these
interests and considered them, along with other matters, in approving the
merger agreement and recommending it for your adoption.

   HoldCo Board of Directors. The merger agreement provides that, at the
effective time, the HoldCo board of directors will consist of at least two
directors who were members of the Conectiv Board, chosen by the mutual
agreement of Pepco and Conectiv.

   Change in Control Severance Agreements and Plans. Conectiv has change-in-
control severance agreements with Messrs. Cosgrove, Shaw, van Roden, Spence and
Mrs. Graham and two other senior executives. The agreements are intended to
encourage the continued dedication of Conectiv's senior management team. The
agreements provide benefits for these executives upon actual or constructive
termination of employment (other than for cause, or by reason of death or
disability) within the two-year period (one-year period for Mr. Cosgrove)
immediately following a change in control of Conectiv, which definition
includes the closing of the transaction. Upon such a termination, an affected
executive would receive, subject to such executive providing Conectiv with a
general release of claims:

  .  a prorated bonus (based on target) for the year of termination;

  .  a payment equal to three times the sum of base salary and target bonus
     for the year of termination (or, if higher in either case, as in effect
     at the change in control);

  .  for three years following termination, continuation of medical, dental,
     vision, group life and disability benefits at least at a level (and cost
     to the executive) that is substantially similar in the aggregate to the
     level of such benefits available to the executive immediately prior to
     the change in control (with limited exceptions); and

  .  a payment equal to the actuarial equivalent of the additional benefit
     under Conectiv's qualified cash balance pension plan and supplemental
     retirement plan had the executive remained employed for an additional 36
     months.

   Conectiv also maintains two change-in-control severance plans for executive
employees and other select employees. The plans are substantially similar to
the change in control severance agreements described above, except that:

  .  the plans provide for two or one and one-half times, respectively, the
     sum of base salary and bonus, rather than three;

  .  the plans provide for continuation of welfare benefits for 24 or 18
     months, rather than 36 months; and

  .  the payment of additional pension benefits is calculated as if the
     employee remained employed for an additional 24 or 18 months, rather
     than 36 months.

   In addition, Conectiv has a Gross-Up and Legal Fee Plan, the terms of which
apply to employees covered by these change-in-control severance agreements and
plans, which provides that (1) Conectiv will pay a gross-up payment in the
event that a covered employee is subject to excise taxes pursuant to Section
4999 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and (2) Conectiv will
pay all legal fees and expenses incurred in a

legal proceeding by a covered employee in seeking to obtain or enforce any
right or benefit under the Gross-Up and Legal Fee Plan or a Conectiv change-in-
control severance agreement or plan.

   Incentive Compensation Plan. Conectiv maintains an incentive plan that
provides for the grant of annual incentive awards (performance-based cash or
stock awards), restricted stock, stock options, performance units, stock
appreciation rights, dividend equivalents and other awards as the
administrative committee determines. The plan provides that in the event of a
change in control of Conectiv, such as the transaction, unless the committee in
its sole discretion specifies otherwise:

  .  all outstanding options and stock appreciation rights will become
     exercisable;

  .  all outstanding performance units will be cashed out pro rata, based on
     the number of full and partial months that have elapsed with respect to
     a performance period;

  .  the restrictions on restricted stock will lapse; and

  .  annual incentive awards will be treated as the committee determines.

   In the event that the committee determines that any dividend,
recapitalization, merger, consolidation, or similar event or transaction
affects Conectiv's common stock such that an adjustment is appropriate to
prevent dilution or enlargement of participants' rights, the committee may make
such an adjustment or may terminate any award and make an equitable cash
payment for its value, as determined by the committee.

   With respect to stock options, the merger agreement provides that option
holders will be able to elect to either (1) receive a cash payment equal to the
excess, if any, of the merger consideration over the exercise price or (2) have
their options converted into options to purchase HoldCo common stock.

   Deferred Compensation and Supplemental Retirement Plans. Conectiv maintains
a Deferred Compensation Plan and a Supplemental Retirement Plan, pursuant to
which and pursuant to the terms of the merger agreement, the Personnel and
Compensation Committee, prior to the closing of the transaction and in
consultation with participants under the plans, will determine whether to (1)
distribute all deferrals in cash immediately (including the value of the
restricted stock units provided as a match under the management stock purchase
program and director stock purchase program in the Conectiv Deferred
Compensation Plan) or (2) distribute all deferrals in accordance with the
distribution elections previously selected by each participant, in which case,
Conectiv, HoldCo and/or Pepco will contribute cash to a grantor trust
(maintained by an institutional trustee independent of the parties) in an
amount not less than the value, as of the closing of the transaction, of all
participants' benefits under each of the plans, as determined by the plans'
actuary.

   Directors' and Officers' Indemnification and Insurance. The merger agreement
provides that, for a period of six years following the effective time, the
directors and officers of Conectiv will continue to be indemnified to the
fullest extent permitted by applicable law. In addition, during this period,
HoldCo has agreed to cause Conectiv to continue to provide these individuals
with directors' and officers' liability insurance and fiduciary liability
insurance coverage.

Regulatory Approvals Required to Complete the Transaction

   Certain federal and state regulatory requirements must be complied with
before we can complete the transaction. While we can not give any assurances as
to if and when any of the consents or approvals required for the transaction
will be obtained or the conditions that may be contained therein, we currently
believe that the necessary approvals can be obtained by the first quarter of
2002.

   State Approvals

              Delaware. Delmarva Power & Light Company (which we refer to as
Delmarva) is subject to the jurisdiction of the Delaware Commission as a public
utility. The approval of the Delaware Commission is

required before a Delaware public utility may directly or indirectly merge or
consolidate with any other person or company. Delaware Commission approval is
also required before any person may directly or indirectly acquire control of a
Delaware public utility. To grant its approval, the Delaware Commission must
find that the transaction is to be made in accordance with law, for a proper
purpose and is consistent with the public interest. HoldCo and Delmarva intend
to seek the approval of the Delaware Commission consistent with these
requirements.

              Maryland. The Maryland Public Service Commission is granted
general authority to supervise and regulate public utilities with operations in
the State of Maryland. Both Pepco and Delmarva have utility operations in the
State of Maryland. Pepco and Conectiv intend to make any necessary filings with
the Maryland Commission under the Commission's general authority to determine
whether the transaction will have an adverse effect on the relevant Maryland
franchises.

              New Jersey. Atlantic City Electric Company (which we refer to as
Atlantic City Electric) is subject to the jurisdiction of the New Jersey Board
of Public Utilities as a public utility. The approval of the New Jersey
Commission is required before any person may directly or indirectly acquire
control of a New Jersey public utility. In considering a request to acquire
control of a public utility, the New Jersey Commission evaluates the impact of
the acquisition on competition, on the ratepayers affected by the acquisition
of control, on the employees of the affected public utility or utilities, and
on the provision of safe and adequate utility service at just and reasonable
rates. HoldCo and Atlantic City Electric intend to seek the approval of the New
Jersey Commission consistent with these requirements.

   Atlantic City Electric has operations that are considered "industrial
establishments" under New Jersey's Industrial Site Recovery Act. Under that
Act, filings with and clearances from the New Jersey Department of
Environmental Protection are required for any direct or indirect change of
ownership of an industrial establishment. However, if a transaction involves
only the indirect owner of an industrial establishment with another owner and
the indirect owner's assets would have been unavailable for remediation under
the Industrial Site Recovery Act, the transaction is not subject to the
requirements of that Act. While we do not believe that any filings or
clearances are required for the transaction, HoldCo, Conectiv and Atlantic City
Electric may make filings with the New Jersey Department of Environmental
Protection as deemed appropriate, including seeking a letter of non-
applicability for the transaction with respect to the Industrial Site Recovery
Act.

              Pennsylvania. Delmarva and Atlantic City Electric each own
minority interests in electric generating stations and related transmission
lines located in Pennsylvania and thus are considered Pennsylvania public
utilities. The approval of the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission is
required for a Pennsylvania public utility to directly or indirectly transfer
any public utility property located in Pennsylvania. To grant its approval, the
Pennsylvania Commission must find that the transaction is necessary or proper
for the service, accommodation, convenience or safety of the public. HoldCo,
Delmarva and Atlantic City Electric intend to seek the approval of the
Pennsylvania Commission consistent with these requirements.

              Virginia. Delmarva provides utility service in Virginia and is
subject to the jurisdiction of the Virginia State Corporation Commission as a
public service company and a public utility. Because of its ownership of
transmission lines in Virginia, Pepco is subject to the jurisdiction of the
Virginia Commission as a public utility for limited purposes. The Virginia
Commission must approve the acquisition of any Virginia public utility and the
disposition of any utility assets located in Virginia. The applicants must show
that the provision of adequate service at just and reasonable rates will not be
threatened or impaired by the transaction. Delmarva and Pepco will seek the
approvals of the Virginia Commission consistent with these requirements.

              District of Columbia. Pepco is subject to the jurisdiction of the
DC Commission. Because Pepco currently has all necessary authority to issue the
securities required to complete the transaction and is not itself directly or
indirectly acquiring another public utility, and HoldCo will not become a
public utility as a result of the transaction, we do not believe that the DC
Commission has direct jurisdiction over the transaction. However, it is
possible that the DC Commission will assert such jurisdiction under its plenary
authority over

the operations of Pepco. Pepco intends to work constructively with the DC
Commission regarding the transaction as well as its ongoing jurisdiction over
Pepco following the transaction, and make any filings with the DC Commission as
are deemed appropriate.

   Federal Approvals

       Antitrust. Under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of
1976, as amended (which we refer to as the HSR Act), and the rules promulgated
thereunder by the Federal Trade Commission, the transaction may not be
consummated until HoldCo, Pepco and Conectiv file notifications and provide
certain information to the Federal Trade Commission and the Antitrust Division
of the Department of Justice and specified waiting period requirements are
satisfied. Even after the HSR Act waiting period expires or terminates, the
Federal Trade Commission or the Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice
may later challenge the transaction on antitrust grounds. If the transaction is
not completed within 12 months after the expiration or earlier termination of
the initial HSR Act waiting period, the parties would be required to submit new
information under the HSR Act and a new waiting period would begin. The parties
intend to file notification and report forms under the HSR Act with the Federal
Trade Commission and the Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice so
that the waiting period will expire or terminate within 12 months before the
anticipated closing of the transaction.

       Public Utility Holding Company Act. In connection with the transaction,
HoldCo must obtain SEC approval under Sections 9(a)(2) and 10 of the 1935 Act.
Section 9(a)(2) requires that a person who owns, or will by virtue of a
transaction come to own, directly or indirectly, 5% or more of the outstanding
voting securities of a public utility company, obtain the approval of the SEC
under Section 10 before acquiring a direct or indirect interest in 5% or more
of the voting securities of any additional public utility company in the same
or a separate transaction. The transaction will result in HoldCo acquiring 5%
or more of the voting securities of the following five public utility
companies: Pepco, Delmarva, Atlantic City Electric, Conectiv Delmarva
Generation, Inc. and Conectiv Atlantic Generation, LLC. Under the applicable
standards of the 1935 Act, the SEC must determine whether:

  .  the transaction would tend towards detrimental interlocking relations or
     a detrimental concentration of control of public utility companies;

  .  the consideration to be paid in connection with the transaction is
     reasonable;

  .  the transaction would unduly complicate the capital structure or be
     detrimental to the proper functioning of HoldCo's holding company
     system; or

  .  the transaction would violate applicable state law.

   In addition, under Section 10 of the 1935 Act, to approve the transaction,
the SEC must also find that the transaction would serve the public interest
because it would tend toward the economical and efficient development of a
single integrated public utility system (in this case consisting of Pepco's and
Conectiv's combined electric utility properties). With respect to Delmarva's
gas utility operations, we believe that based on recent orders issued by the
SEC under the 1935 Act, the parties will be permitted to retain such gas
operations. HoldCo intends to file an application with the SEC requesting
approval of the transaction under the 1935 Act.

   HoldCo expects that after the completion of the transaction, it will have to
register with the SEC as a public utility holding company under the 1935 Act.
The 1935 Act imposes a number of restrictions on the operations of registered
holding company systems. These restrictions include a requirement that the SEC
approve, in advance, securities issuances, sales and acquisitions of utility
assets or of securities of utility companies and acquisitions of interests in
other businesses. The 1935 Act also limits the ability of registered holding
companies to engage in non-utility ventures and regulates transactions between
various affiliates within the holding company system, including the provision
of services by holding company affiliates to the system's utilities. Although
under the 1935 Act the SEC may require the divestiture of any business of the
combined

companies that is not functionally related to its core utility businesses as a
condition to approval of the transaction, HoldCo believes that all of its
material non-utility activities after completion of the acquisition will meet
the requirements for retention by a registered holding company. In addition, we
plan to seek any SEC approvals which we believe are necessary to allow the
continued growth of these businesses.

       Federal Power Act. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission must approve
the transaction. Under Section 203 of the Federal Power Act, the Federal Energy
Regulatory Commission is directed to approve a merger if it finds such merger
consistent with the public interest. In reviewing a merger, the Federal Energy
Regulatory Commission generally evaluates:

  .  whether the merger will adversely affect competition;

  .  whether the merger will adversely affect rates; and

  .  whether the merger will impair the effectiveness of regulation.

The parties intend to file an application with the Federal Energy Regulatory
Commission requesting approval of the transaction under the Federal Power Act
in the first half of 2001.

       Atomic Energy Act. Atlantic City Electric holds licenses issued by the
Nuclear Regulatory Commission in connection with its 7.41% ownership interest
in the Salem Nuclear Generating Station, its 7.51% ownership interest in the
Peach Bottom Atomic Generating Station, and its 5% ownership interest in the
Hope Creek Nuclear Generating Station. The Atomic Energy Act of 1954 requires
that any direct or indirect transfer of a license must be approved by the
Nuclear Regulatory Commission. Although Atlantic City Electric has entered into
agreements to sell its interests in these nuclear facilities, and the related
license transfers have been approved by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, the
sale of the facilities is not a condition to completing the transaction. As a
result, if the sale of the nuclear facilities has not been completed, the
transaction will constitute an indirect change of control of Atlantic City
Electric and therefore an indirect transfer of its nuclear licenses. Atlantic
City Electric intends to file an application with the Nuclear Regulatory
Commission in connection with the transaction as appropriate.

       The Communications Act. The Communications Act of 1934 prohibits the
transfer, assignment or disposal in any manner of any construction permit or
station license or any related rights, to any person without approval from the
Federal Communications Commission. The Federal Communications Commission will
approve a transfer of control if it serves the public convenience, interest and
necessity. We will seek the necessary approval from the Federal Communications
Commission for the transfer of control of licenses held by Pepco, Starpower,
Delmarva, Atlantic City Electric, and Conectiv Communications, Inc.

   Other. We are not aware of any material governmental consents or approvals
that are required prior to the parties' consummation of the transaction other
that those described above. Under the terms of the merger agreement, HoldCo,
Pepco and Conectiv have each agreed to use their reasonable best efforts to
obtain all regulatory approvals, consents and clearances required for the
transaction.

                              THE MERGER AGREEMENT

   The description of the merger agreement set forth below highlights important
terms of the merger agreement, a copy of which is attached to this joint proxy
statement/prospectus as Annex A. This description does not purport to be
complete and it may not include all the information that interests you. We urge
you to read the merger agreement carefully and in its entirety.

Effects of the Transaction

   On the fifth business day after the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions
to the transaction as set forth in the merger agreement, the closing of the
transaction will occur. The time of the closing of the mergers in the
transaction is referred to as the effective time. At the effective time, the
Pepco Merger will occur, in which Merger Sub A will be merged with and into
Pepco in accordance with the applicable provisions of the laws of the
Commonwealth of Virginia and the District of Columbia, and Pepco will be the
surviving corporation and will continue its corporate existence under the laws
of the District of Columbia and the Commonwealth of Virginia. In the Pepco
Merger, holders of Pepco common stock will receive one share of HoldCo common
stock for each share of Pepco common stock that they hold. No shares of Pepco
preferred stock will be exchanged in the Pepco Merger and any shares of Pepco
preferred stock that were issued and outstanding before the Pepco Merger will
remain issued and outstanding following the Pepco Merger. As a result of the
Pepco Merger, Pepco will become a subsidiary of HoldCo. See "The Transaction--
What Stockholders Will Receive" on page 27.

   Also at the effective time, the Conectiv Merger will occur, in which Merger
Sub B will be merged with and into Conectiv in accordance with the laws of the
State of Delaware, and Conectiv will be the surviving corporation and will
continue its existence under the laws of the State of Delaware. In the Conectiv
Merger, stockholders of Conectiv will receive shares of HoldCo or cash for each
share of Conectiv stock that they own. As a result of the Conectiv Merger,
Conectiv will become a subsidiary of HoldCo. See "The Transaction--What
Stockholders Will Receive" on page 27.

   At the effective time, all shares of Pepco common stock and Conectiv stock
that are held by any of Pepco, Conectiv or their subsidiaries will be cancelled
and will cease to exist, and no consideration will be paid for any of these
shares. In addition, all shares of HoldCo common stock that are issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the effective time will also be canceled, and
no consideration will be delivered in exchange for them.

   As part of the closing of the transaction, the merger agreement provides
that the parties will file articles of merger with the State Corporation
Commission of Virginia and the Mayor of the District of Columbia with respect
to the Pepco Merger, and a certificate of merger with the Secretary of State of
the State of Delaware with respect to the Conectiv Merger, as prescribed by the
laws of Virginia, District of Columbia and Delaware, respectively. The mergers
will become effective simultaneously and at the time that Pepco and Conectiv
specify in the certificate of merger and articles of merger.

Procedure for Stockholder Elections

   Stockholders of Pepco do not need to make any election regarding the
consideration payable to them, as they will automatically be entitled to
receive one share of HoldCo common stock for each share of Pepco common stock
which they own.

   Holders of shares of Conectiv stock (other than shares held by Pepco,
Conectiv or any of their subsidiaries, which will be canceled in the
transaction) issued and outstanding immediately prior to the election date (as
described below) will be entitled, subject to the limitations described below,
to choose one of the consideration options listed below, on their form of
election:

  . to receive HoldCo common stock as consideration for each share of
    Conectiv stock that they own;

  .  to receive cash as consideration for each share of Conectiv stock that
     they own; or

  .  to receive cash for some of the shares of Conectiv stock that they own
     and to receive HoldCo common stock for some of the shares of Conectiv
     stock that they own.

   A form of election and complete instructions for properly making an election
to receive cash, stock or a combination of cash and stock will be mailed to
stockholders under separate cover not more than 60 and not less than 20
business days before the election date. If a stockholder does not make any
election as to the form of consideration he or she wishes to receive, or if
Pepco or the exchange agent determines, in its discretion, that an election has
not been properly made, then those shares may receive cash or stock
consideration, as Pepco may determine.

Limits on Cash and Stock Consideration and Allocation Rules

   The aggregate total number of shares of Conectiv stock to be converted into
the right to receive cash consideration in the transaction will be equal to 50%
(which we refer to as the Required Cash Number), and the aggregate total number
of shares of Conectiv stock to be converted into the right to receive
consideration of HoldCo common stock in the transaction will be equal to 50%
(which we refer to as the Required Stock Number), in each case of the total
number of shares of Conectiv stock issued and outstanding immediately before
the effective time of the transaction. Pepco stockholders will receive one
share of HoldCo common stock for each share of Pepco common stock they own
without regard to any allocation or proration procedures.

   For the purpose of calculation under these allocation rules, one share of
Conectiv Class A common stock will be counted as equal to 0.86757 shares of
Conectiv common stock. (See "How the Merger Consideration for the Conectiv
Class A Common Stock Was Determined" on page 28.)

   Because of the limitations on the number of shares of Conectiv stock to be
exchanged for the right to receive cash consideration and stock consideration
under the election and allocation procedures described in this joint proxy
statement/prospectus, no assurance can be given that holders of Conectiv stock
will receive the form of cash or stock consideration they have elected to
receive.

   Allocation of Cash Available for Election. In the event that the aggregate
number of shares of Conectiv stock in respect of which cash elections are
received is greater than 50% of the aggregate number of shares of Conectiv
stock issued and outstanding immediately before the effective time of the
transaction, then:

  (1)  all shares of Conectiv stock as to which stockholders elect to receive
       HoldCo common stock as consideration, and all shares of Conectiv stock
       as to which no election is made, will be exchanged for HoldCo common
       stock and cash in lieu of fractional shares;

  (2)  a proration factor will be determined by dividing the aggregate number
       of shares of Conectiv stock for which cash elections were made by the
       Required Cash Number, and then the number of shares of Conectiv stock
       covered by each form of election as to which a cash election was made
       will be multiplied by this proration factor, with the resulting number
       of these shares receiving cash consideration; and

  (3)  the remaining shares of Conectiv stock not exchanged for cash under
       number (2) above will be exchanged for HoldCo common stock and cash in
       lieu of fractional shares.

   Allocation of HoldCo Common Stock Available for Election. The merger
agreement provides that 50% of the aggregate number of shares of Conectiv stock
issued and outstanding immediately before the effective time of the transaction
will be converted into HoldCo common stock consideration. In the event that the
aggregate number of shares of Conectiv stock in respect of which stock
elections are received is greater than 50% of the aggregate number of shares of
Conectiv stock issued and outstanding immediately before the effective time of
the transaction, then:

  (1)  all shares of Conectiv stock as to which stockholders elect to receive
       cash as consideration, and all shares of Conectiv stock as to which no
       election is made, will be exchanged for cash consideration;

  (2)  a proration factor will be determined by dividing the aggregate number
       of shares of Conectiv stock for which stock elections were made by the
       Required Stock Number, and then the number of shares of Conectiv stock
       covered by each form of election as to which a stock election was made
       will be multiplied by this proration factor, with the resulting number
       of these shares receiving stock consideration; and

  (3)  the remaining shares of Conectiv stock not exchanged for HoldCo common
       stock under number (2) above will be exchanged for cash consideration.

   As a result of the above-described proration, the amount of cash and stock
received by Conectiv stockholders may differ from their actual elections, and
no assurance can be given that holders of Conectiv stock will receive the
amount of cash or stock consideration they have elected to receive. Therefore,
if HoldCo common stock is oversubscribed, a stockholder of Conectiv who elected
to receive some or all of his or her consideration in HoldCo common stock will
receive less HoldCo common stock than he or she elected. If cash is
oversubscribed, a stockholder of Conectiv who elected to receive some or all of
his or her consideration in cash will receive less cash than he or she elected.

Exchange of Stock Certificates and Payment of Cash

   Exchange Agent. Prior to the effective time, Pepco will appoint a bank or
trust company as the exchange and paying agent in connection with the
transaction. The exchange agent will handle the exchange of certificates and
the payment of all consideration in connection with the transaction. At or
prior to the effective time, Pepco and HoldCo will deposit with the exchange
agent sufficient cash and certificates representing HoldCo common stock to make
all payments and deliveries under the merger agreement.

   Exchange Procedures. Prior to the effective time, Pepco will prepare a form
of election which will be mailed by the exchange agent to the record holders of
Conectiv common stock and Conectiv Class A common stock not more than 60 nor
less than 20 business days prior to the election date (as described below). The
exchange agent will use reasonable efforts to make a form of election available
to all persons who become stockholders of Conectiv between the record date and
the date that is two business days before the effective date (which we refer to
as the election date). The form of election will be used by each of these
stockholders to indicate the form of consideration which he or she wishes to
receive for the shares of Conectiv common stock and Conectiv Class A common
stock which he or she holds. Stockholders may indicate that they wish to
receive cash, shares of HoldCo common stock or a combination of cash and stock.
Shares as to which no valid form of election is received, or shares as to which
the stockholder indicates no preference as to the type of consideration, will
be deemed to have elected cash or shares of HoldCo common stock as determined
by Pepco.

   Conectiv stockholders will have until the election date to return the
completed and signed form of election, together with the certificates that
represent the stock of Conectiv to which the form of election relates, to the
exchange agent. To be effective, a form of election must be:

  .  properly completed and signed by the stockholder of record;

  .  accompanied by certificates for the Conectiv stock for which the
     election is being made (duly endorsed in blank or otherwise in form
     acceptable for transfer on the books of Conectiv, or by an appropriate
     guarantee of delivery); and

  .  delivered to the exchange agent before 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on
     the date specified in the form of election.

   Stockholders may revoke their elections by sending written notice to the
exchange agent before the deadline for submitting elections. Upon any such
revocation, the certificates (or delivery guarantees) covered by

the election will be promptly returned. Pepco (and, at Pepco's option, the
exchange agent) will have the discretion to determine whether forms of election
have been properly completed, signed and submitted or revoked and to disregard
immaterial defects in forms of election.

   Within five days of the effective time, the exchange agent will mail to all
holders of Pepco common stock and to those holders of Conectiv common stock and
Conectiv Class A common stock who did not return a properly executed and
complete form of election:

  .  a letter of transmittal for use in submitting shares to the exchange
     agent for exchange; and

  .  instructions explaining what the stockholder must do to effect the
     surrender of Pepco and/or Conectiv certificates in exchange for
     consideration to be issued in the transaction.

   Pepco stockholders, and any Conectiv stockholder who has not already
submitted all of his or her certificates accompanied by a form of election,
should complete and sign the letter of transmittal and return it to the
exchange agent together with such certificates in accordance with the
instructions. Stockholders who hold shares through a nominee (for example, if
their shares of common stock are held by a broker as nominee) will not need to
request that certificates be issued. Those stockholders will need to make their
elections in the same time period and will receive separate instructions at
that time.

   Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates. If certificates for any Pepco or
Conectiv stock have been lost, stolen or destroyed, the stockholder must submit
an affidavit to that effect to the exchange agent. HoldCo may also require the
stockholder to deliver a bond to the exchange agent in an amount reasonably
required to indemnify the exchange agent against claims with respect to lost
certificates.

   Transfer of Ownership. The exchange agent will issue a certificate for
shares of HoldCo common stock in a name other than that in which the Pepco or
Conectiv certificate surrendered in exchange therefor was registered only if
the certificate surrendered is properly endorsed and otherwise in proper form
for transfer. The person requesting the exchange must also have paid any
required transfer or other taxes or established to the satisfaction of the
exchange agent that no tax is payable.

   Payments Following Surrender. After the effective time, each stockholder who
has surrendered his or her certificates to the exchange agent with the letter
of transmittal, or, in the case of Conectiv stockholders, possibly with the
form of election, will be entitled to receive the merger consideration, which
will consist of a certificate representing, in the aggregate, the whole number
of shares of HoldCo common stock that that stockholder has the right to receive
under the merger agreement and/or a check in an amount equal to any cash that
such holder has the right to receive as consideration for his or her shares of
Conectiv stock plus, in the case of Conectiv stockholders, any cash that such
holder has the right to receive as payment for fractional shares of HoldCo
common stock. Also upon such surrender of certificates, the stockholder will be
entitled to receive payment for the amount of dividends or other distributions
with a record date before the effective time that have already been paid with
respect to whole shares of HoldCo common stock. These stockholders will also be
paid, on the appropriate payment date the amount of dividends or other
distributions with a record date after the effective time but prior to
surrender, and a payment date subsequent to surrender, payable with respect to
such whole shares of HoldCo common stock. No interest will be paid or will
accrue on any cash payable under the merger agreement.

   Stockholders should not forward certificates to Pepco or Conectiv at any
time. Stockholders should not forward certificates to the exchange agent until
they have received a form of election or letter of transmittal. Stockholders
should not return certificates with the enclosed proxy. A form of election and
complete instructions for properly making an election to receive cash, HoldCo
common stock or a combination of cash and stock will be mailed to Conectiv
stockholders under separate cover not more than 60 days nor less than 20 days
before the anticipated election date (which is two business days before the
anticipated effective time), and a letter of transmittal will be mailed to
Pepco stockholders and to Conectiv stockholders who did not return a

properly executed and complete form of election, within five days of the
effective time. The effective time is currently anticipated to be in the first
quarter of 2002.

Covenants Relating to the Conduct of Business Before the Effective Time

   Ordinary Course of Business. In the merger agreement, each of Pepco and
Conectiv has agreed that, pending the completion of the transaction, each of
them and their subsidiaries will carry on their businesses in

the usual, regular and ordinary course consistent with past practice and will
use all commercially reasonable efforts to preserve intact their present
business organizations and goodwill, preserve the goodwill and relationships
with customers, suppliers and others having business dealings with them and
(subject to prudent management of their workforces and on-going programs
currently in force) keep available the services of their present officers and
employees, to the end that their goodwill and ongoing businesses shall not be
impaired in any material respect at the effective time.

   Conectiv Covenants. Under the merger agreement, during the period from
February 9, 2001 until the effective time, Conectiv has agreed as to itself and
its subsidiaries that, except as contemplated or permitted by the merger
agreement or as required by a governmental entity or by applicable law, rule or
regulation, or to the extent that Pepco consents in writing (which consent is
not to be unreasonably delayed or withheld), Conectiv and each of its

  .  actions that would reasonably be expected to result in the closing
     conditions not being satisfied.

Conectiv also agrees, if requested by Pepco, to use its reasonable best efforts
to obtain certain third-party consents.

   Pepco Covenants. Under the merger agreement, during the period from February
9, 2001 until the effective time, Pepco has agreed as to itself and its
subsidiaries that, except as contemplated or permitted by the

merger agreement or as required by a governmental entity or by applicable law,
rule or regulation, or to the extent that Conectiv consents in writing (which
consent is not to be unreasonably delayed or withheld), Pepco and each of its
subsidiaries will be subject to customary restrictions for the conduct of its
business as to, among other things:

  .  dividends and distributions;

  .  changes in capital structure;

  .  issuances of securities;

  .  organizational documents;

  .  acquisitions;

  .  dispositions of assets;

  .  incurrence of guarantees or indebtedness;

  .  accounting matters;

  .  1935 Act matters;

  .  insurance;

  .  actions with respect to the tax treatment of the transaction;

  .  acquisition of other entities;

  .  activities of HoldCo, Merger Sub A and Merger Sub B;

  .  actions that would reasonably be expected to result in the closing
     conditions not being satisfied; and

  .  actions that could reasonably be expected to materially delay or impede
     the transaction.

   Additional Covenants. Conectiv and Pepco have also agreed to several other
covenants for the conduct of their actions prior to the effective time. Among
these are that, subject to applicable laws and regulations:

  .  Conectiv will confer with, and report to, Pepco on operational matters;

  .  Conectiv and Pepco will file all reports required to be filed by each of
     them with the SEC and other governmental entities between February 9,
     2001 and the effective time and will deliver to the other party copies
     of all these documents;

  .  each party will have the right to review in advance, and will consult
     with the other with respect to, all the information relating to the
     other party and each of their respective subsidiaries, which appears in
     any filings, announcements or publications made with, or written
     materials submitted to, any third party or any governmental entity in
     connection with the transaction;

  .  Conectiv and Pepco will each appoint one or more representatives to a
     committee that will be responsible for coordinating transition planning
     and implementation relating to the transaction; and

  .  Conectiv, HoldCo and Pepco will coordinate with each other the
     declaration, setting of record dates and payment of dividends on capital
     stock of Conectiv or any of Conectiv's subsidiaries so that holders of
     capital stock of Conectiv or any of Conectiv's subsidiaries do not
     receive dividends on either both or none of the capital stock of
     Conectiv or any of Conectiv's subsidiaries and HoldCo common stock
     received in the transaction in respect of any calendar quarter.

   In addition, each of Pepco and Conectiv may, with respect to the quarter in
which the effective time occurs, pay a special dividend with respect to each
class of its common stock in an amount consisting of the pro rata portion of
the dividend which it would be permitted to pay had the effective time not
occurred in that quarter, payable for the period from and including the first
day of such quarter through, but not including, the day of the effective time.

Acquisition Proposals

   Negotiations and Provision of Information. Under the merger agreement,
Conectiv has agreed that it will immediately cease any existing discussions or
negotiations, if any, with any parties with respect to any proposal for
Conectiv to engage in any merger, recapitalization, consolidation, business
combination, sale of 15% or more of the consolidated assets of Conectiv and its
subsidiaries, taken as a whole, sale of 15% or more of the shares of capital
stock of Conectiv or any of its subsidiaries whose assets constitute 15% or
more of the consolidated assets of Conectiv and its subsidiaries, taken as a
whole, or similar or comparable transactions involving Conectiv or any of its
subsidiaries, other than the transactions contemplated in the merger agreement.
We refer to any such proposal as an Acquisition Proposal. Conectiv agrees not
to solicit, initiate, knowingly encourage or otherwise facilitate any inquiries
or the making of any proposal or offer with respect to an Acquisition Proposal,
and not to engage in negotiations or discussions concerning, or provide any
non-public information to any entity relating to any Acquisition Proposal.

   The Conectiv Board may, however, furnish information to, or engage in
discussions or negotiations with, any person in response to an unsolicited bona
fide written Acquisition Proposal of that person if, and only to the extent
that, the Conectiv Board determines in good faith, after consultation with
outside legal counsel, that such action is reasonably necessary for the
Conectiv Board to act in a manner consistent with its fiduciary duties under
applicable law.

   Superior Proposal. If a third party makes a bona fide written proposal for
Conectiv to engage in any merger, recapitalization, consolidation, business
combination, sale of a majority of the consolidated assets of Conectiv and its
subsidiaries, taken as a whole, sale of a majority of the shares of capital
stock of Conectiv or any of its subsidiaries whose assets constitute a majority
of the consolidated assets of Conectiv and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole,
or similar or comparable transactions involving Conectiv or any of its
subsidiaries, that the Conectiv Board concludes in good faith (after
consultation with its financial advisor and legal counsel), taking into account
all legal, financial, regulatory and other aspects of the proposal and the
person making the proposal, would, if consummated, result in a transaction that
is more favorable to Conectiv's stockholders (in their capacities as
stockholders), from a financial point of view, than the transactions
contemplated by the merger agreement and is reasonably capable of being
completed (which we refer to as a Superior Proposal), then the Conectiv Board
may approve the Superior Proposal and terminate the merger agreement, but only
if:

  .  Conectiv first provides Pepco with a reasonable opportunity (not to
     exceed three business days) to make adjustments in the terms and
     conditions of the merger agreement sufficient to cause the Conectiv
     Board to determine that the Superior Proposal at issue no longer
     constitutes a Superior Proposal; and

  .  Conectiv pays to Pepco a termination fee of $60 million.

Stock Options

   Under the merger agreement, Conectiv agrees to take all action reasonably
necessary so that, immediately prior to the effective time, the outstanding
stock options issued under its stock option plan will become vested and
exercisable as of the effective time and will, at the election of the holder
thereof, be either:

  .  canceled, in which case the holder will be entitled to receive cash in
     an amount equal to the excess, if any, of $25 per share over the
     exercise price per share of the stock option, or

  .  converted into an option to purchase a number of shares of HoldCo common
     stock that the stockholder would have received in the transaction had
     the stock option been exercised prior to the effective time.

   The exercise price of each converted option will be adjusted to retain the
ratio between the exercise price of the option and the value of the underlying
shares of stock. Otherwise, the terms and conditions of the converted options
will not change. HoldCo will use its best efforts to register, and maintain the
registration of, the HoldCo common stock subject to the converted options.

Employment Related Obligations; Employee Benefits

   Following the effective time of the transaction, and subject to the other
terms of the merger agreement, HoldCo will, or will cause the appropriate
subsidiary to:

  .  assume and honor all employment-related obligations, agreements and
     benefits plans covering current and former employees, directors and
     consultants of Conectiv or any of its subsidiaries;

  .  for at least two years after the effective time, provide each Conectiv
     employee with a base salary or wages at least equal to that provided to
     the employee immediately prior to the effective time, and provide
     benefits to these employees that are no less favorable in the aggregate
     than the benefits provided to them immediately prior to the effective
     time;

  .  for that two-year (or, if applicable, such longer) period, provide each
     Conectiv employee with severance payments and benefits no less favorable
     than those provided under the Conectiv severance plans and policies in
     effect immediately prior to the effective time; and

  .  for the two-year period following the effective time, not amend (other
     than to provide for the substitution of stock in connection with the
     transaction) or terminate Conectiv's supplemental retirement plan or
     deferred compensation plan.

   Although HoldCo, Conectiv or the appropriate subsidiary will assume the
obligations described above, except for Conectiv's supplemental retirement plan
and deferred compensation plan, HoldCo, Conectiv or the appropriate subsidiary
may terminate or amend any benefit plan if such amendment or termination is
allowed under the plan, subject to satisfaction of any legal duty to bargain
with the collective bargaining representatives with respect to these matters.

   In addition, if Conectiv's Personnel and Compensation committee decides to
distribute benefits to participants according to the participants' previous
elections in its supplemental retirement plan and deferred compensation plan
upon termination of employment or service following the effective time, Pepco,
HoldCo or Conectiv will, to the extent Conectiv has not already done so,
contribute cash to a grantor trust or trusts maintained by an independent
institutional trustee, as soon as practicable after the effective time of the
transaction, in an amount not less than the value, as of the effective time, of
all participants' benefits under the supplemental retirement plan and the
deferred compensation plan, as determined by Conectiv's actuary.

   With respect to any Conectiv benefit plans in which Conectiv employees
participate after the effective time, HoldCo will, or will cause Conectiv or
the appropriate subsidiary to:

  .  if either satisfied or inapplicable under Conectiv's benefit plans
     immediately before the effective time, waive limitations as to pre-
     existing conditions, exclusions and waiting periods related to
     participation and coverage of Conectiv's employees under any benefit
     plan in which these employees may participate after the effective time;

  .  provide each Conectiv employee with credit for any co-payments and
     deductibles paid prior to the effective time; and

  .  if recognized under a comparable Conectiv benefit plan immediately
     before the effective time, recognize Conectiv's employees' service with
     Conectiv and its current and former affiliates for all purposes in
     benefit plans in which these employees may be eligible to participate
     after the effective time, unless it would result in a duplication of
     benefits that is neither contemplated in a HoldCo plan, agreement or
     arrangement nor approved by HoldCo.

Directors' and Officers' Indemnification and Insurance

   With certain limitations and restrictions, the merger agreement provides
that, for a period of six years following the effective time, HoldCo and
Conectiv (as the surviving corporation in the Conectiv Merger) will,

jointly and severally, indemnify and hold harmless, to the fullest extent
permitted under applicable law, any person who was an officer, director or
employee of Conectiv and its subsidiaries at the effective time against all
claims, losses, liabilities, damages, judgments, fines and reasonable fees,
costs and expenses (including attorneys' fees and expenses) incurred in
connection with any claim, action, proceeding or investigation, whether civil,
criminal, administrative or investigative, arising out of or pertaining to the
fact that the person is or was an officer, director or employee of Conectiv or
any of its subsidiaries or matters existing or occurring at or prior to the
effective time, whenever these claims, actions, etc. were asserted or claimed.

   The persons who receive this indemnification may not settle any claim
without the prior approval of HoldCo, and will be entitled to advancement of
expenses incurred in the defense of any claim, action, proceeding or
investigation; provided that any person to whom these expenses are advanced
must provide an undertaking, to the extent required by the Delaware General
Corporation Law, to repay these advances if it is ultimately determined that
this person is not entitled to indemnification.

   In addition, HoldCo has agreed to cause Conectiv (as the surviving
corporation in the Conectiv Merger):

  .  to maintain in effect, for a period of six years after the effective
     time, in its certificate of incorporation and bylaws the current
     provisions regarding elimination of liability of directors and
     indemnification of, and advancement of expenses to, officers, directors
     and employees contained in the certificate of incorporation and bylaws
     of Conectiv; and

  .  at the election of HoldCo, for a period of six years after the effective
     time, either:

   .  to maintain in effect the current policies of directors' and officers'
      liability insurance and fiduciary liability insurance maintained by
      Conectiv, or

   .  to provide tail coverage for persons covered by current policies of
      directors' and officers' liability insurance and fiduciary liability
      insurance maintained by Conectiv which will provide coverage for a
      period of six years for acts prior to the effective time on terms no
      less favorable than the terms of such current insurance coverage.

Additional Agreements

   Reasonable Best Efforts. The parties have agreed as to themselves and their
subsidiaries that, subject to the terms and conditions of the merger
agreement, they will use their reasonable best efforts to take all actions and
do all things necessary, proper or advisable under applicable laws and
regulations to consummate the transaction as soon as practicable, including
the obtaining of regulatory approvals.

   Pepco's Stock Buyback Program. Prior to the effective time, Pepco will not
rescind, or modify in a manner adverse to Conectiv, its program to repurchase
up to $450 million of Pepco common stock. In addition, Pepco agrees to
implement such program in good faith consistent with past practices and
subject to its reasonable business judgment.

   The HoldCo Board. At or prior to the effective time, the HoldCo Board will
elect, effective immediately following the effective time, at least two
persons who were members of the Conectiv Board prior to the effective time.
Those directors will be chosen by the mutual agreement of Pepco and Conectiv.

   Significant Presence and Community Support. The merger agreement provides
that Pepco intends that Conectiv, after the effective time, will maintain a
significant presence in Wilmington, Delaware. In addition, after the effective
time, Conectiv will provide charitable contributions and community support at
comparable levels as have been provided before the effective time within
Conectiv's and its subsidiaries' service areas.

Termination

   Pepco and Conectiv each have the right to terminate the merger agreement,
whether before or after the stockholders have adopted the merger agreement,
under the following circumstances:

  .  by mutual written consent;

  .  if the transaction has not been completed by August 9, 2002, so long as
     the delay has not been caused by a failure of the party seeking
     termination to fulfill its obligations under the merger agreement. If
     all closing conditions are satisfied or able to be satisfied on August
     9, 2002, other than the receipt of the required statutory approvals, but
     the receipt of these approvals is being pursued diligently and in good
     faith, then the date for termination will be extended to February 9,
     2003;

  .  if any governmental entity has issued an order, decree or ruling or has
     taken any other action permanently restraining, enjoining or otherwise
     prohibiting the transaction, and this order, decree, ruling or other
     action has become final and nonappealable, unless this action by the
     governmental entity was to any extent caused by the failure of the party
     seeking termination to fulfill its obligations in the merger agreement
     to work with these governmental entities to permit the transaction to be
     completed; or

  .  if the stockholders of either party do not adopt or approve the merger
     agreement at their duly held meetings of stockholders.

   In addition, Pepco has the right to terminate the merger agreement under the
following circumstances:

  .  if the Conectiv Board withdraws, or modifies in any manner adverse to
     Pepco, its approval of the merger agreement, approves or recommends an
     Acquisition Proposal or resolves to take any of those actions; or

  .  if a material breach of Conectiv's representations, warranties,
     covenants or agreements in the merger agreement has occurred such that
     Conectiv would not satisfy its closing conditions under the merger
     agreement before August 9, 2002 (or, if applicable, February 9, 2003)
     and this breach has not been remedied within 30 business days after
     Conectiv receives notice in writing from Pepco specifying the nature of
     such breach and requesting that it be remedied, as long as at that time
     Pepco, HoldCo, Merger Sub A and Merger Sub B are not in material breach
     of any of Pepco's representations, warranties, covenants or agreements
     contained in the merger agreement.

   In addition, Conectiv has the right to terminate the merger agreement under
the following circumstances:

  .  if the Conectiv Board approves a Superior Proposal, as long as Conectiv
     first provides Pepco with a reasonable opportunity to make adjustments
     in the terms and conditions of the merger agreement sufficient to cause
     the Conectiv Board to determine that the Superior Proposal no longer
     constitutes a Superior Proposal and Conectiv pays Pepco the termination
     fee described below;

  .  if a material breach of Pepco's, HoldCo's, Merger Sub A's and Merger Sub
     B's representations, warranties, covenants or agreements in the merger
     agreement has occurred such that the Pepco would not satisfy its closing
     conditions under the merger agreement before August 9, 2002 (or, if
     applicable, February 9, 2003) and this breach has not been remedied
     within 30 business days after Pepco receives notice in writing from
     Conectiv specifying the nature of such breach and requesting that it be
     remedied, as long as at that time Conectiv is not in material breach of
     any of its representations, warranties, covenants or agreements
     contained in the merger agreement;

  .  if the Pepco Board withdraws, or modifies in any manner adverse to
     Conectiv, its approval of the merger agreement or resolves to take any
     of those actions; or

  .  if the Average Final Price is less than $16.50, as long as Conectiv
     first gives Pepco written notice of Conectiv's intent to terminate for
     this reason at any time during the three-business day period starting on
     the date on which the Average Final Price was determined, following
     which Pepco has two business days to, at its option, supplement the
     stock portion of the merger consideration by either (i) adjusting the
     exchange ratio so as to provide holders of Conectiv stock with a value
     of $21.15 per share of Conectiv common stock and $18.35 per share of
     Conectiv Class A common stock or (ii) maintaining the exchange ratio and
     paying additional cash consideration to Conectiv stockholders entitled
     to receive HoldCo common stock so that they receive a total value of
     $21.15 per share of Conectiv common stock and $18.35 per share of
     Conectiv Class A common stock, or (iii) doing a combination of (i) and
     (ii), provided that any such combination must be in the same proportion
     with respect to the Conectiv common stock and the Conectiv Class A
     common stock. See "The Transaction--Conectiv "Walk-Away' Right and Pepco
     "Top-Up' Right" on page 31.

   Effect of Termination. If the merger agreement is terminated, there will be
no liability or obligation on the part of Pepco or Conectiv or any of their
officers or directors, except as otherwise provided in the merger agreement
and as described below under "--Termination Fees." Nothing, however, will
relieve any party from liability for a willful breach of the merger agreement.

   Termination Fees. Under the merger agreement, termination fees are payable
in the following circumstances:

  .  If Conectiv terminates the merger agreement due to the Conectiv Board's
     approval of a Superior Proposal, Conectiv will be obligated to pay a
     termination fee of $60 million to Pepco.

  .  If Conectiv or Pepco terminate the merger agreement due to the failure
     of Conectiv's stockholders to adopt the merger agreement, at any time
     after February 9, 2001 and at or before the time of the Conectiv
     stockholders' meeting, a bona fide Acquisition Proposal (with the
     replacement of "15%" with "35%" in the definition of Acquisition
     Proposal) has been made public and has not been withdrawn and, within 12
     months of the termination of the merger agreement, Conectiv enters into
     a definitive agreement with a third party with respect to an Acquisition
     Proposal (which is subsequently consummated) or an Acquisition Proposal
     is consummated, then Conectiv will be obligated to pay a termination fee
     of $60 million to Pepco.

  .  If Pepco terminates the merger agreement as a result of the Conectiv
     Board withdrawing or modifying its approval of the merger agreement and
     the transaction, approving or recommending an Acquisition Proposal, or
     resolving to do any of those things, so long as this action by the
     Conectiv Board giving rise to Pepco's termination right was not caused
     by Pepco entering into a definitive agreement with respect to

   a Pepco Transaction that could reasonably be expected to materially delay
   or impede the consummation of the transaction, then Conectiv will be
   obligated to pay a termination fee of $60 million to Pepco.

  .  If Conectiv or Pepco terminate the merger agreement due to the failure
     of Pepco's stockholders to adopt the merger agreement, at any time after
     February 9, 2001 and at or before the time of the Pepco stockholders'
     meeting a bona fide proposal with respect to a Pepco Transaction has
     been made public and not withdrawn and, within 12 months of the
     termination of merger agreement, Pepco enters into a definitive
     agreement with a third party with respect to a Pepco Transaction (which
     is subsequently consummated) or a Pepco Transaction is consummated, then
     Pepco will be obligated to pay a termination fee of $60 million to
     Conectiv.

  .  If Conectiv terminates the merger agreement as a result of the Pepco
     Board withdrawing or modifying its approval of the merger agreement and
     the transaction, or resolving to do any of those things, then Pepco will
     be obligated to pay a termination fee of $60 million to Conectiv.

Amendment and Waiver

   Amendment. The merger agreement may be amended by Pepco, Conectiv and
HoldCo at any time before or after the stockholders of Pepco and Conectiv
adopt the merger agreement. However, after these stockholder approvals, if any
laws or rules of any relevant stock exchange require additional stockholder
approval for an amendment, then such an amendment may not be made without that
approval.

   Extension; Waiver. At any time prior to the effective time, the parties
may:

  .  extend the time for the performance of any of the obligations or other
     acts of the other parties;

  .  waive any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties of the
     other parties; and

  .  waive compliance with any of the agreements or conditions contained in
     the merger agreement.

   The failure of any party to the merger agreement to assert any of its
rights under the merger agreement will not constitute a waiver of those
rights.

                APPROVAL OF THE HOLDCO LONG-TERM INCENTIVE PLAN

   In connection with the transaction, the HoldCo Board has adopted the HoldCo
Long-Term Incentive Plan (which we refer to in this section as the Plan). The
Plan is being submitted for approval to the stockholders of Pepco and the
stockholders of Conectiv at their respective annual meetings. If the
transaction is completed and the Plan is approved by the stockholders of both
Pepco and Conectiv, the Plan will become effective on the closing date of the
transaction.

Description of the Plan

   The continuing growth and development and financial success of HoldCo and
its subsidiaries will be dependent upon ensuring the best possible management.
The HoldCo Board believes that the Plan will be an important aid to HoldCo in
attracting and retaining individuals of outstanding abilities and in rewarding
them for the continued profitable performance of HoldCo and its subsidiaries. A
summary of the material provisions of the Plan is set forth below. Please read
this information in conjunction with the full text of the Plan, which is
attached as Annex I to this joint proxy statement/prospectus.

   Objective. The objective of the Plan is to increase stockholder value by
providing a long-term incentive to reward officers, key employees, and
directors of HoldCo and its subsidiaries for the profitable performance of
HoldCo and its subsidiaries, and to increase the ownership of HoldCo common
stock by such individuals.

   Term of the Plan. The Plan has a term of ten years, commencing at the
effective time, but may be terminated earlier by the HoldCo Board.

   Shares Available under the Plan. The total number of shares of HoldCo common
stock for which awards may be granted to participants under the Plan is
10,000,000. If an award lapses or the participant's rights with respect to an
award otherwise terminate, the shares of HoldCo common stock subject to the
award will again be available for future awards under the Plan. The shares of
HoldCo common stock available for awards under the plan may consist of
authorized and unissued shares, shares held in treasury, or shares purchased in
the open market (including private purchases).

   Administration. The Plan provides that it will be administered by a
committee of the HoldCo Board (which we refer to as the Committee), but
generally allows the HoldCo Board in its entirety, in its discretion, to assume
responsibility for any of the functions for which the Committee is responsible
under the terms of the Plan, except in the case of awards that are intended to
satisfy the requirements of section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code. In
addition, the HoldCo Board has retained the sole authority and discretion to
modify the provision of the Plan that provides for an annual grant to the non-
employee directors of HoldCo of an option to purchase 1,000 shares of HoldCo
common stock. Subject to these qualifications, the Plan gives the Committee
broad authority to determine the persons to whom, and the times at which,
awards will be granted, expire, or lapse, the types of awards to be granted,
the number of shares of HoldCo common stock to be covered by each award, and
all other terms and conditions for awards granted under the Plan. After awards
are made, the Committee also is responsible for all questions of interpretation
and application of the Plan.

Eligible Participants

   Under the Plan, the Committee from time to time, in its sole discretion, may
make awards to officers or key employees of HoldCo and its subsidiaries
selected by the Committee and may grant awards in the form of nonqualified
stock options to the non-employee directors of HoldCo. In addition, in
accordance with the terms of the Plan, each non-employee director of HoldCo
will receive annually, on or about May 1 of each year, a nonqualified stock
option to purchase 1,000 shares of HoldCo common stock. The Pepco Board
anticipates that immediately following the effectiveness of the Plan
approximately     officers and key employees of HoldCo and approximately
non-employee directors of HoldCo would be eligible to participate in the Plan.

   Awards. The Plan provides for the granting of the following types of awards:

   Restricted Stock. An award of restricted stock consists of shares of HoldCo
common stock that the grantee is prohibited from transferring until the lapse
of a restriction period and that are subject to forfeiture if the condition to
the vesting of the shares is not satisfied. Receipt of a restricted stock award
does not require a payment by the grantee. The Committee establishes the terms
and conditions of each grant, including the restriction period (which will be
not less than one and not more than ten years), whether dividends will be paid
currently or accumulated, and the form of any dividend payment.

   The vesting of a restricted stock award may be conditioned on the completion
of a specified period of service (which we refer to as a service-based award)
or on the attainment, during a performance period, of one or more performance
objectives (which we refer to as a performance-based award). The performance
objectives for performance-based awards, which may vary from participant to
participant, will be based on such performance criteria or combination of
factors, as the Committee deems appropriate. In the case of a performance-based
restricted stock award that is intended to satisfy the requirements of section
162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code, the vesting of the award may be based, in
the sole discretion of the Committee, on one or more business criteria that
relate to the individual grantee, groups of individuals, a product or service
line, a business unit, a division, or a subsidiary of HoldCo or HoldCo as a
whole, individually or in any combination. The performance goals will consist
of any one or more of the following:

  .  gross, operating or net earnings before or after income taxes;

  .  earnings per share;

  .  book value per share;

  .  cash flow per share;

  .  return on equity;

  .  return on investment;

  .  return on assets, employed assets or net assets;

  .  total stockholder return (expressed on a dollar or percentage basis);

  .  return on cash flow;

  .  internal rate of return;

  .  cash flow return on investment;

  .  improvements in capital structure;

  .  residual income;

  .  gross income, profitability or net income;

  .  price of any HoldCo security;

  .  sales to customers (expressed on a dollar or percentage basis);

  .  retention of customers (expressed on a dollar or percentage basis);

  .  increase in HoldCo's or a subsidiary's customer satisfaction ratings
     (based on a survey conducted by an independent third party);

  .  economic value added (defined to mean net operating profit minus the
     cost of capital);

  .  market value added (defined to mean the difference between the market
     value of debt and equity, and economic book value);

  .  market share;

  .  level of expenses;

  .  combined ratio;

  .  payback period on investment; and

  .  net present value of investment.

On completion of the restriction period and attainment of any performance
objectives, the restrictions will expire with respect to one or more shares of
restricted stock. If target performance objectives are exceeded, the Committee
may award additional shares of HoldCo common stock to a participant.

   Options. An option entitles the holder to purchase shares of HoldCo common
stock at an exercise price determined at the time of the grant. Options granted
under the Plan may be either incentive stock options that are qualified under
section 422 of the Internal Revenue Code (or ISOs) or options that are intended
not to qualify under that provision (or Nonqualified Options). The grant of an
option does not require a payment by the grantee. Options may not be granted
with an exercise price per share that is less than 100% of the fair market
value of a share of HoldCo common stock on the grant date. The term of an
option may not exceed ten years. In the Committee's discretion, the exercise
price may be paid in cash, shares of HoldCo common stock, or combination of the
cash and stock.

   Performance Units. Performance units are the right to receive a payment in
cash, HoldCo common stock, or both, upon the attainment during a performance
period of one or more performance objectives. Receipt of a performance unit
does not require a payment by the grantee. The performance objectives, which
may vary from participant to participant, will be based on such performance
criteria of combination of factors as the Committee deems appropriate. In the
case of a performance unit that is intended to satisfy the requirements of
section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code, the performance goals are the same
as those that are set forth above for performance-based awards of restricted
stock.

   Stock Appreciation Rights. Stock appreciation rights (or SARs) are the right
to receive a payment equal in amount to the difference between, depending on
the terms of the SAR, either the fair market value of a share of HoldCo common
stock or the book value of a share of HoldCo common stock on the date of the
award and the date of exercise. SARs may be awarded in conjunction with an
option or as a separate award. Receipt of an SAR does not require a payment by
the grantee. If an SAR is awarded in conjunction with a stock option, the
exercise of the SAR will extinguish the corresponding stock option, and vice
versa. The term of an SAR may not exceed ten years. The payment upon the
exercise of SARs may be made in cash, in shares of HoldCo common stock, or
both, in the Committee's discretion.

   Dividend Equivalents. A dividend equivalent entitles the recipient to
receive a payment in an amount equal to the dividends paid on shares of HoldCo
common stock from the date of grant until the dividend equivalent lapses.
Dividend equivalents may be granted in conjunction with an option, a separately
awarded stock appreciation right, restricted stock, performance units, or
awards of additional HoldCo common stock if performance-based restricted stock
target performance objectives are exceeded. Receipt of dividend equivalents
does not require a payment by the grantee. Dividend equivalents lapse no later
than the date that the corresponding award lapses or is exercised.

Limitations on Performance-Based Awards to Certain Executives

   No award of performance-based restricted stock or performance units made to
a person who is, or in the opinion of the HoldCo Board or the Committee is
likely to be, a "covered employee" within the meaning of section 162(m) of the
Internal Revenue Code (whom we refer to as a covered executive) is permitted to
exceed $3,000,000, either in cash or in fair market value of HoldCo common
stock, for any performance period. In addition, no covered executive is
permitted to receive more than 5,000,000 in the aggregate of options, stock
appreciation rights, and shares of performance-based restricted stock over the
ten-year term of the Plan.

Consequences of a Change in Control of HoldCo

   If a participant in the Plan is terminated as an employee or director or
suffers a diminution of responsibility, authority, position, or salary
following a change in control of HoldCo, any outstanding awards held by the
participant will be affected in the following manner:

  .  All outstanding restricted stock awards will be entitled to an
     accelerated payout that is prorated based on the number of months of the
     restricted period that have elapsed when the change in control occurs.
     In determining the amount of the payment, the maximum performance
     achievement will be assumed.

  .  All outstanding options or stock appreciation rights will become
     immediately exercisable.

  .  All outstanding performance unit awards will be entitled to an
     accelerated payout that is prorated based on the number of months of the
     performance period that have elapsed when the change in control occurs,
     and assuming that the maximum performance was achieved.

   The term "change in control" as defined by the Plan means:

  .  the purchase or acquisition by any person, entity, or group of persons
     of beneficial ownership of 30% or more of the combined voting power of
     HoldCo's then outstanding shares of voting securities;

  .  the approval by the stockholders of HoldCo of a merger or consolidation
     with respect to which persons who were stockholders of HoldCo
     immediately prior to such merger or consolidation do not, immediately
     thereafter, own more than 70% of the combined voting power of the merged
     or consolidated entity's then outstanding securities;

  .  a liquidation of HoldCo or the sale of substantially all of its assets;
     or

  .  within a 24-month period, a change of more than one-half of the members
     of the HoldCo Board whose election by the HoldCo Board or nomination for
     election by HoldCo's stockholders was approved by a vote of at least 2/3
     of the directors who were directors at the beginning of the period or
     whose election or nomination was previously so approved.

Tax Withholding

   HoldCo or its subsidiaries may withhold any applicable federal, state, or
local taxes upon payment under an award. Subject to any applicable law, if
payment under an award is to be made in HoldCo common stock, the HoldCo Board
may in its discretion permit or require a participant to satisfy any
withholding or other taxes payable through:

  .  the payment of cash by the participant to HoldCo or its subsidiaries;

  .  the retention by HoldCo or its subsidiaries of shares of HoldCo common
     stock; or

  .  the delivery by the participant to HoldCo or its subsidiaries of shares
     of HoldCo common stock owned by the participant.

Amendment or Termination of the Plan

   The HoldCo Board may at any time and from time to time alter, amend,
suspend, or terminate the Plan, in whole or in part, as it determines in its
sole discretion. However, no such action may, without the consent of the
participant to whom any award was previously granted, adversely affect the
rights of such participant concerning the award, except to the extent that such
termination, suspension, or amendment of the Plan or award (1) is required by
law or (2) is deemed by the HoldCo Board necessary in order to comply with the
requirements of section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code or Rule 16b-3 under
the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.

Federal Income Tax Consequences

   The following is a discussion of the material federal income tax
consequences of the various types of awards under the Plan:

   Restricted Stock. The grant of restricted stock generally does not result in
taxable income to a participant or a tax deduction for HoldCo. At the time the
restrictions expire, however, a participant will realize ordinary taxable
income in an amount equal to the fair market value of the HoldCo common stock
on the date the restrictions expire, and HoldCo will be entitled to a
corresponding deduction. In addition, during or after the restriction period
(depending on whether the dividends are paid to the individuals or
accumulated), a participant will be taxed on the dividends paid with respect to
restricted stock as compensation, and HoldCo will be entitled to a
corresponding deduction.

   Incentive Stock Options. ISOs are intended to meet the requirements of
section 422 of the Internal Revenue Code. The grant of an ISO does not result
in taxable income to the participant or a tax deduction for HoldCo. The
exercise of an ISO will not result in ordinary taxable income to the
participant (although the difference between the exercise price and the fair
market value of the HoldCo common stock subject to the option may result in
alternative minimum tax liability to the participant) and HoldCo will not be
allowed a deduction at any time in connection with such award, if the following
conditions are met:

  .  at all times during the period beginning with the date of grant and
     ending on the day three months before the date of exercise, the
     participant is an employee of HoldCo or of a subsidiary; and

  .  the participant makes no disposition of HoldCo common stock within two
     years from the date of grant nor within one year after the HoldCo common
     stock is transferred to the participant.

The three-month period is extended to one year in the event of disability and
is waived in the event of death of the participant. If the HoldCo common stock
is sold by the participant after meeting these conditions, any gain realized
over the exercise price ordinarily will be treated as long-term capital gain,
and any loss will be treated as long-term capital loss, in the year of the
sale.

   If the participant fails to comply with the employment or holding period
requirements discussed above, the participant will recognize ordinary taxable
income in an amount equal to the lesser of:

  .  the excess of the fair market value of the HoldCo common stock on the
     date of exercise over the exercise price; or

  .  the excess of the amount realized upon such disposition over the
     exercise price. If the participant realizes ordinary taxable income on
     account of such a disqualifying disposition (described above), a
     corresponding deduction will be allowed to HoldCo for the same year.

   Nonqualified Stock Options. The grant of a Nonqualified Option does not
result in taxable income to the participant or a tax deduction for HoldCo. Upon
exercise of a nonqualified stock option, the participant will realize
compensation taxable as ordinary income in an amount equal to the difference
between the exercise price and the fair market value of the HoldCo common stock
on the date of exercise, and HoldCo will be entitled to a corresponding
deduction for the same year. The participant's basis in such shares will be the
fair market value on the date income is realized, and when the participant
disposes of the shares he or she will recognize capital gain or loss, either
long-term or short-term, depending on the holding period of the shares.

   Stock Appreciation Rights. The grant of an SAR does not result in taxable
income to the participant or a tax deduction for HoldCo. Upon exercise of an
SAR, the participant will realize ordinary taxable income in an amount equal to
the excess of the fair market value of the HoldCo common stock or cash received
over any amount paid by the participant upon exercise, and HoldCo will be
entitled to a corresponding deduction for the same year.

   Performance Units. The grant of a performance unit does not result in
taxable income to the participant or a tax deduction for HoldCo. Upon the
expiration of the applicable award cycle and receipt of the HoldCo common
stock distributed in payment of the award or an equivalent amount of cash, the
participant will realize ordinary taxable income equal to the full fair market
value of the shares delivered or the amount of cash paid. At that time, HoldCo
generally will be allowed a corresponding tax deduction equal to the
compensation taxable to participant.

   Dividend Equivalents. Dividend equivalents generally are taxed as
compensation when they are paid to the participant, and HoldCo receives a
corresponding deduction. If a participant elects (with the Committee's
consent) to be taxed on the value of a restricted stock award when the award
is granted, however, dividend equivalents paid with respect to the award will
be taxed as dividends and will not be deductible by HoldCo.

   Deduction Limit. Compensation paid to HoldCo's chief executive officer and
its four other most highly compensated officers generally will not be
deductible to the extent it exceeds $1 million. Certain performance-based
awards granted under a stockholder-approved plan are exempt from this
deduction limit, however. The Plan permits the Committee to make performance-
based awards to participants who otherwise might be subject to the deduction
limit.

New Plan Benefits

   The benefits that may be received under the Plan by any participant or
group of participants are not determinable, except for the annual grant to
each non-employee director of an option to purchase 1,000 shares. All other
awards to eligible participants will depend on future determinations made by
the HoldCo Board or the Committee.

Vote Required

   Approval of the Plan requires the affirmative vote of the holders of a
majority of the shares of Pepco common stock present in person or represented
by proxy and entitled to vote at the meeting. Abstentions will be deemed
present and entitled to vote, but will not be counted as a vote either for or
against this proposal, and therefore will have the same effect as a vote
against the approval of the Plan. Shares that are the subject of broker non-
votes will be counted as shares not entitled to vote.

   Likewise, approval of the Plan requires the affirmative vote of the holders
of a majority of the shares of Conectiv stock present in person or represented
by proxy and entitled to vote at the annual meeting. Abstentions will be
deemed present and entitled to vote, but will not be counted as a vote either
for or against this proposal, and therefore will have the same effect as a
vote against the approval of the Plan. Shares that are the subject of broker
non-votes will be counted as shares not entitled to vote.

   The Pepco Board and the Conectiv Board each recommend a vote "FOR" the
adoption of the Plan.

               UNAUDITED PRO FORMA COMBINED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

   The unaudited pro forma combined financial information have been prepared to
give effect to the merger of Pepco and Conectiv resulting in both becoming
wholly owned subsidiaries of New RC, Inc. (HoldCo), a company recently formed
by Pepco (the transaction). The transaction will be accounted for as an
acquisition of Conectiv by Pepco under the purchase method of accounting. The
unaudited pro forma financial information is derived from the December 31, 2000
historical financial statements of Pepco and the unaudited December 31, 2000
historical financial statements of Conectiv. The Conectiv historical financial
statements have been reclassified to conform to the presentation in Pepco's
financial statements. The unaudited pro forma balance sheet assumes the
transaction was consummated as of December 31, 2000. The unaudited pro forma
income statement assumes the transaction was consummated as of the beginning of
the year ended December 31, 2000.

   Under the purchase method of accounting, the assets and liabilities of
Conectiv and liabilities assumed will be recorded at fair value and any excess
of the merger consideration, including direct acquisition costs, over such
amounts will be recorded as goodwill. The unaudited pro forma financial
information does not give effect to possible acquisition financing in
connection with this transaction as no specific conclusions have been reached
as to the amount or type of borrowing.

   The fair value of Conectiv's regulated assets equal their unaudited
historical net book value since such assets are recognized for ratemaking
purposes at their book value in determining regulated revenue requirements.
Conectiv maintains a portfolio of non-regulated generating assets and has
entered into agreements to sell certain assets included in that portfolio. The
unaudited pro forma financial information does not give effect to the sale of
these assets since such agreements are subject to regulatory approval. For
purposes of the unaudited pro forma combined financial information, the fair
values have been determined based on Conectiv's sales agreements in place for
assets to be sold and valuations performed during 2000 for retained non-
regulated generating assets.

   This unaudited pro forma combined financial information should be read in
conjunction with the separate historical financial statements and accompanying
notes of Pepco and Conectiv. The unaudited pro forma combined financial
information are not necessarily indicative of the results of operations or
financial position that would have been achieved had the transactions reflected
therein been consummated as of the dates indicated, or of the results of
operations or financial position for any future periods or dates.

           NOTES TO UNAUDITED PRO FORMA COMBINED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

    (a)  The following pro forma adjustment is used to record the estimated par
value of HoldCo common stock ($.01) to be issued to existing Pepco and Conectiv
stockholders and to eliminate each company's existing par value common stock
balance. The number of shares of HoldCo common stock to be issued was estimated
using the number of Pepco common stock and Conectiv common stock and Class A
common stock shares outstanding as of December 31, 2000. Each outstanding share
of Pepco common stock was converted into one share of HoldCo common stock and
each outstanding share of Conectiv common stock and Class A common stock was
converted into HoldCo common stock on the basis outlined in the merger
agreement, as shown below:

                                                          As of December 31,

                                                               ========

   The par value calculation above assumes that at the consummation of the
transaction the Average Final Price equals $21.40. The merger agreement defines
boundaries (the "collar") for the Average Final Price. If the Average Final
Price does not fall within the established collar of $19.50 to $24.50 then the
effect of the Average Final Price and the Conectiv common stock exchange ratio,
as defined in the merger agreement, will impact the pro forma financial
information including total goodwill, goodwill amortization, and paid in
capital. The impact of Pepco's closing share price being above $24.50 or below
$19.50 will be as follows:

  .  If the Average Final Price price falls below $19.50, the total number of
     HoldCo common stock shares issued to Conectiv common stockholders will
     increase by approximately 5.0 million shares. For each $1.00 decrease in
     the Average Final Price below $19.50, the total merger consideration
     would decrease by approximately $56.3 million primarily resulting in a
     decrease to additional paid in capital and goodwill relating to the
     unaudited pro forma Combined Balance Sheet and a reduction of
     $1.4 million to goodwill amortization included in net income on the
     unaudited pro forma Combined Statement of Earnings.

  .  If the Average Final Price price rises above $24.50, the total number of
     HoldCo common stock shares issued to Conectiv common stockholders will
     decrease by approximately 6.5 million shares. For each $1.00 increase in
     the Average Final Price above $24.50, the total merger consideration
     would increase by approximately $44.8 million primarily resulting in a
     increase to additional paid in capital and

     goodwill relating to the unaudited pro forma Combined Balance Sheet and
     an additional $1.1 million in goodwill amortization included in net
     income on the unaudited pro forma Combined Statement of Earnings.
    (b) Adjustment to reflect HoldCo's additional paid-in capital:

                                                            As of December 31,

                                                           ---------------------

    (c) Under the terms of the merger agreement, Pepco's and Conectiv's common
stock held in treasury at December 31, 2000 will be canceled. The pro forma
entry eliminates Pepco's treasury stock related to the excess of cost over par
value of common stock (see Adjustment (a)--elimination of common stock) to
additional paid in capital and retained earnings on a pro rata basis.
Conectiv's unaudited historical amounts eliminate treasury stock, unearned
compensation, accumulated other comprehensive loss and retained income.

    (d) The table below presents the estimated total cost of acquiring
Conectiv and the allocation of that cost to Conectiv's identifiable tangible
and intangible assets and liabilities. Although this calculation is
preliminary, it represents all supportable adjustments known to Conectiv's and
Pepco's management.

                                                                   Required

   In addition to the stock consideration paid by HoldCo for Conectiv [see
Adjustments (a) and (b)], cash consideration of $1,098 million will be paid
[see Adjustment (a)].

   (1) This amount includes a $306.7 million adjustment to record non-regulated
generating assets adjusted to fair value based on existing agreements to divest
in 2001 and a $191.0 million adjustment to other generating assets based on
independent valuations performed in 2000. The unaudited pro forma financial
information does not give effect to the sale of these assets since such
agreements are subject to regulatory approval. The fair value of Conectiv's
regulated assets reflect their book value due to the jurisdictional ratemaking
process, as regulated assets are recognized for ratemaking purposes at their
book values in determining regulated revenue requirements. Accordingly, the
economic substance is that the fair value of regulated assets is their book
value.

   (2) This amount consists of adjustments of $183.4 million for additional
prepaid pension assets based on the excess of plan assets over the projected
benefit obligation after eliminating unrecognized actuarial gains, prior
services costs and net transaction assets, $97 million to record the fair value
of energy contracts as determined by comparing contractual costs to quoted
market prices for equivalent purchase energy contracts and $2.9 million to
record the market value of contracts under FAS 133.

   (3) This amount consists of adjustments for the assumption of liabilities
related to $24.0 million of estimated merger costs for Conectiv, $10 million
for the estimated compensation that Conectiv will incur due to the change in
control and $11.1 million adjustment to record an estimated liability
associated with Conectiv's settlement of stock options held by certain Conectiv
officers and management. The Unaudited Pro Forma Combined Statement of Earnings
for the year ended December 31, 2000 does not reflect these amounts, as they
are nonrecurring charges.

   (4) Adjustment to record $2.9 million and $1.7 million fair value
adjustments to Conectiv's long-term debt and preferred stock.

   (5) Adjustment to eliminate $26.8 million of Conectiv deferred investment
tax credits (which we refer to as ITC); and a liability reduction of $8.6
million relating to other post retirement benefits projected plan obligations
over plan assets after eliminating unrecognized actuarial gains, prior service
costs and net trust or obligations for the excess of the fair value of the plan
assets over the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation.

   (6) Represents the net deferred tax liability for the estimated income tax
effect of the pro forma adjustments, other than the elimination of Conectiv
ITCs included in (5) above, using an estimated effective tax rate of 40%.

   (e) Adjustment to reflect the amortization of the adjustment to goodwill
over a 40-year period of $14.4 million and $14.9 million in depreciation based
on the pro forma adjustments to property plant and equipment using an estimated
depreciation rate of 3% and the effect of $6.0 million for the unaudited pro
forma adjustment excluding non-deductible goodwill to based on an effective tax
rate of 40%.

   (f) Adjustment to reflect the weighted average number of common stock shares
outstanding giving effect to the common stock shares issued to the Conectiv
common stockholders.

paid to Conectiv stockholders:

                                 MARCH 13, 2001

1. Formation and Organization

   New RC, Inc. (HoldCo) was incorporated under the laws of the Delaware on
February 9, 2001, as a wholly owned subsidiary of Potomac Electric Power
Company (Pepco). HoldCo has issued 100 shares of common stock (with a par value
of $.01), all of which is owned by Pepco. HoldCo will be a holding company
registered under the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935, as amended.

   Pepco, HoldCo, and Conectiv (a Delaware corporation), entered into an
Agreement and Plan of Merger (Agreement) on February 9, 2001, providing for a
reorganization in which two wholly owned and newly formed subsidiaries of
HoldCo will merge with and into Pepco and Conectiv, respectively. As a result
of these mergers, Pepco and Conectiv will be wholly owned subsidiaries of
HoldCo and existing Pepco and Conectiv shareholders will own all outstanding
shares of HoldCo. The Agreement is expected to close shortly after all of the
conditions to the consummation of the Agreement, including obtaining applicable
regulatory approvals, are met or waived. The regulatory approval process is
expected to take approximately 12 to 18 months from the date of the Agreement.

                             ACQUISITION FINANCING

   Before completing the transaction, the management of Pepco and HoldCo will
evaluate various sources and methods of financing the amount necessary to fund
a portion of the cash consideration to be paid in the transaction (the total
amount of approximately $1.098 billion). We currently anticipate that a portion
of the cash consideration will be financed at the HoldCo level through external
sources. Sources of financing that we are considering include commercial and
investment banks, institutional lenders and public securities markets. Methods
of financing that we may consider include commercial paper, bank lines of
credit, debt and preferred securities of various maturities and types. The
management of Pepco and HoldCo believe that HoldCo will have access to many
sources and types of short-term and long-term capital sources at reasonable
rates.

                            INFORMATION ABOUT PEPCO

Potomac Electric Power Company
1900 Pennsylvania Avenue, N.W.
Washington, D.C. 20068

   Pepco is engaged in three principal lines of business: (1) the provision of
regulated electric utility transmission and distribution services in the
Washington, D.C. metropolitan area, (2) the supply of telecommunications
services including local and long distance telephone, high-speed Internet and
cable television, and (3) the supply of energy products and services in
competitive retail markets. Pepco's regulated electric utility activities are
referred to herein as the "Utility" or "Utility Operations," and its
telecommunications services and competitive energy activities are referred to
herein as its "Competitive Operations."

   Utility Operations. In 2000, the generating segment of the electric utility
industry continued to transition from a regulatory to a competitive
environment, and in response to this transition, the Utility executed its
business plan to exit the electricity generating business by completing the
divestiture of substantially all of its generation assets in early 2001.
Additionally, Pepco's comprehensive plans to implement customer choice were
completed as Maryland and D.C. customers began to have their choice of
electricity suppliers on July 1, 2000, and January 1, 2001, respectively.

   In accordance with the terms of agreements approved by the Maryland
Commission in 1999, retail access to a competitive market for generation
services was made available to all Maryland customers on July 1, 2000. Also
under these agreements, Maryland customers who are unable to receive generation
services from another supplier, or who do not select another supplier, are
entitled to receive services (default services) from Pepco until July 1, 2004,
at a rate for the applicable customer class that is no higher than the bundled
rate in effect on June 30, 2000, but subject to adjustment for tax law changes
enacted by the Maryland General Assembly relating to its authorization of
electric industry restructuring. Thereafter, Pepco will provide default
services using power obtained through a competitive bidding process at
regulated tariff rates determined on a pass-through basis and including an
allowance for the costs incurred by Pepco in providing the services. In D.C.,
customers began to have their choice of electricity suppliers on January 1,
2001. Pepco has a full requirements contract with Mirant Corp. to fulfill these
obligations.

   Competitive Operations. Over the past few years, with the passage of the
Telecommunications Act of 1996, and the deregulation of the natural gas and
electric industries also under way, the focus of Pepco's Competitive Operations
has been expanded to include telecommunications and energy businesses. To
facilitate this expansion, in May 1999, Pepco created a new unregulated
company, Pepco Holdings, Inc. (PHI), as the parent company of two wholly owned
subsidiaries, Potomac Capital Investment Corporation (PCI) and Pepco

Energy Services. Pepco's telecommunications services are provided by PCI and
its competitive energy products and services are provided by Pepco Energy
Services. Additional information about Pepco's competitive telecommunications
services and financial investments, and its competitive energy products and
services, is provided below.

   Competitive Telecommunications Services and Financial Investments. Pepco
supplies bundled residential telecommunications products and services through
PCI's operations in the D.C. and Northern Virginia metropolitan areas. PCI also
manages a financial investments portfolio intended to provide additional
earnings and cash flow. PCI's telecommunications products and services are
provided through Starpower Communications (Starpower), which was formed in 1997
by wholly owned subsidiaries of PCI and RCN Corporation (RCN). Starpower is
currently the only regional company providing cable television, local and long
distance telephone, dial-up and high-speed Internet services in a competitively
priced, bundled package for residential consumers, over an advanced fiber-optic
network.

   Beginning in the mid-1990s, PCI began redirecting its business operations by
reducing its involvement in investments that are not related to the energy or
telecommunications industries. Significant progress has been made in reducing
PCI's previous concentration of investments in the aircraft industry and recent
investments have expanded PCI's portfolio of electric generating and natural
gas transmission and distribution equipment leases.

   PCI's utility industry products and services are provided through various
operating interests. Its underground cable services company, W. A. Chester,
provides construction, installation and maintenance services to utilities and
to other customers throughout the United States. During 2000, PCI acquired
Severn Cable, a growing telecommunications contractor in the Washington, D.C.
metropolitan area that specializes in the installation of strand, fiber-optic
and coaxial cable. Additionally, in 1999, PCI launched Pepco Technologies,
Inc., a new business strategy that is focused on bringing new technologies to
the electric utility industry as it deregulates.

   Competitive Energy Products and Services. Pepco Energy Services currently
provides nonregulated energy and energy-related products and services in the
mid-Atlantic region. Its products include electricity, natural gas, energy-
efficiency contracting, equipment operation and maintenance, fuel management,
and appliance warranties. These products and services are sold either in
bundles or individually to commercial, industrial, and residential customers.
In addition, with the transfer of the Benning Road and Buzzard Point generating
plants from the Utility to Pepco Energy Services in December 2000, its
operations now also include the generation and sale of electricity in the
wholesale market.

                           INFORMATION ABOUT CONECTIV

Conectiv
800 King Street
Wilmington, DE 19801

   Conectiv began operations on March 1, 1998, upon completion of a series of
merger transactions involving Delmarva and Atlantic Energy, Inc. (the former
parent of Atlantic City Electric and which we refer to as Atlantic Energy).
Conectiv's primary businesses are: the supply and delivery of electricity and
gas in markets subject to price regulation (we refer to these as regulated
businesses), trading under the name "Conectiv Power Delivery;" and the supply
and trading of electricity and gas in markets not subject to price regulation
(we refer to these as non-regulated businesses), trading under the name
"Conectiv Energy." These businesses, particularly the regulated businesses, are
weather sensitive and seasonal because sales of electricity are usually higher
during the summer months, due to air conditioning usage, and natural gas sales
are usually higher in the winter when gas is used for space-heating. Conectiv
also has a telecommunications business.

   Business Segments. Conectiv currently has the following business segments:

  .  "Power Delivery" includes activities related to delivery of electricity
     and gas to customers at regulated prices over transmission and
     distribution systems. The Power Delivery business is conducted by
     Delmarva and Atlantic City Electric. Rates charged to Delmarva's
     customers for delivery services are subject to regulation primarily by
     the Delaware Public Service Commission, Maryland Public Service
     Commission, and Virginia State Corporation Commission. Rates charged to
     Atlantic City Electric's customers for electric delivery service are
     subject to regulation primarily by the New Jersey Board of Public
     Utilities.

  .  "Energy" includes the following businesses, trading under the name
     "Conectiv Energy": (a) the generation, purchase, trading and sale of
     electricity, including the obligations of Delmarva and Atlantic City
     Electric to supply electricity to customers who do not choose an
     alternative electricity supplier; (b) gas and other energy supply and
     trading activities, (c) power plant operation services, and (d) district
     heating and cooling systems operation and construction services provided
     by an additional Conectiv subsidiary, Conectiv Thermal Systems, Inc.

  .  "Telecommunications" represents services provided by another Conectiv
     subsidiary, Conectiv Communications, Inc., including local and long-
     distance telephone service and Internet services. Conectiv initiated a
     process in 2000 to identify a strategic partner for CCI. Due to
     weaknesses in the valuations of telecommunications businesses, Conectiv
     continues to evaluate its partnering or other options.

   Electric Utility Industry Restructuring. The electric utility businesses of
Delmarva and Atlantic City Electric were restructured in 1999 pursuant to
legislation enacted in Delaware, Maryland, and New Jersey and orders issued by
the Delaware Public Service Commission, Maryland Public Service Commission, and
New Jersey Board of Public Utilities. Among other things, the electric
restructuring orders provided for the choice of alternative electricity
suppliers by customers, decreases in customer electric rates, recovery of
stranded costs (which are the uneconomic portion of assets and long-term
contracts that resulted from electric utility industry restructuring),
securitization of Atlantic City Electric's stranded costs, and the regulatory
treatment of any gain or loss arising from the divestiture of electric power
plants. All customers in Atlantic City Electric's service area could choose an
alternative electricity supplier, effective August 1, 1999. All of Delmarva's
Delaware and Maryland customers, or about 95% of Delmarva's customers, could
choose an alternative electricity supplier by October 1, 2000.

   Mid-merit Electric Generation. Conectiv is changing the types of electric
generating plants it owns in conjunction with implementing its asset-backed,
"merchant" strategy focusing on "mid-merit" electric generating plants. Mid-
merit electric generating plants can quickly increase or decrease their
kilowatt-hour (or kWh) output level on an economic basis. Mid-merit plants
typically have relatively low fixed operating and

maintenance costs and also can use different types of fuel. These plants are
generally operated during times when demand for electricity rises and prices
are higher. In contrast, baseload electric generating plants run almost
continuously to supply the base level of demand for electricity, or the minimum
demand level which generally always exists on an electrical system. Conectiv
management expects that mid-merit electric generating plants will be more
profitable and provide higher returns on invested capital than baseload
electric generating plants. Delmarva sold its ownership interests in baseload
nuclear electric generating plants on December 29, 2000, and the ownership
interests of Conectiv subsidiaries in other baseload electric generating plants
are expected to be sold during 2001, pursuant to existing agreements.

   Conectiv plans to add to its mid-merit electric generating plants by
building combined cycle units, which include combustion turbines, waste heat
recovery boilers and a steam turbine. On September 21, 2000, Conectiv announced
that it had ordered 21 combustion turbines, which, with additional equipment,
could be constructed into 8 combined cycle units. Each combined cycle unit
would represent approximately 500 MW, allowing Conectiv to add up to 4,000 MW
of electric generating capacity or about $2.5 billion to $3.0 billion of plant.
Under an accelerated schedule, construction would occur in phases and would be
completed by the end of 2004.

   Conectiv is actively working on developing sites for combined cycle units
within the PJM Interconnection region. The three new combustion turbines
planned for the Hay Road site are expected to be installed during the summer of
2001 (adding 330 MW of capacity) and the waste heat recovery boiler and steam
turbine needed for combined cycle operation are expected to be installed by the
third quarter of 2002 (resulting in 550 MW of total capacity for the combined
cycle unit). The expected installation dates of the combined cycle units could
change depending on whether suitable financing is obtained, construction
proceeds on schedule, permits and licenses are obtained as planned, and other
factors.

                       COMPARATIVE RIGHTS OF STOCKHOLDERS

Controlling Law and Documents

   The rights of Pepco common and preferred stockholders are governed by the
corporate laws of the District of Columbia and Virginia, the Pepco restated
articles of incorporation and articles of restatement (which we refer to as the
Pepco articles), and the Pepco bylaws, as amended (which we refer to as the
Pepco bylaws). The rights of Conectiv stockholders are governed by the
corporate law of the State of Delaware, the Conectiv restated certificate of
incorporation (which we refer to as the Conectiv certificate) and the Conectiv
bylaws. In the transaction, holders of Pepco common stock and Conectiv stock
will become holders of HoldCo common stock. The rights of HoldCo stockholders
will be governed by the corporate law of the state of Delaware, the HoldCo
certificate and the HoldCo bylaws. The Pepco preferred stock will remain
outstanding after the transaction and the rights of holders of Pepco preferred
stock will remain unchanged.

   The material differences between the rights of a Pepco common stockholder
under the Pepco articles, the Pepco bylaws and District of Columbia and
Virginia laws, or the rights of a Conectiv stockholder under the Conectiv
certificate and the Conectiv bylaws and Delaware law as of the date of this
joint proxy statement/prospectus, on the one hand, and the rights of a holder
of HoldCo common stock under the HoldCo certificate, the HoldCo bylaws and
Delaware law as of the effective time, on the other hand, are summarized below.

   This summary does not purport to be a complete statement of all differences,
and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the relevant provisions of the
laws and the documents discussed below. Also, this summary does not reflect any
rules of the NYSE that may apply to HoldCo, Pepco or Conectiv in connection
with the matters discussed.

Authorized Capital

   Pepco: Pepco's authorized equity capitalization consists of 216,550,000
shares of stock, of which 7,750,000 shares are designated as serial preferred
stock, par value $50 per share; 8,800,000 shares are designated as preference
stock, par value $25 per share; and 200,000,000 shares are designated as common
stock, par value $1 per share.

   Conectiv: Conectiv's authorized equity capitalization consists of
150,000,000 shares of common stock, par value $.01 per share; 10,000,000 shares
of Class A common stock, par value $.01 per share; and 20,000,000 shares of
preferred stock, par value $.01 per share. Under the Conectiv certificate, the
Conectiv Board has the power to issue preferred stock and to designate its
rights and preferences, which might be superior to the Conectiv common stock
and Conectiv Class A common stock. The Conectiv Board has designated 1,200,000
shares of preferred stock as Series One Junior Preferred Stock and 65,606
shares of preferred stock as Series Two Junior Preferred Stock and in each case
reserved such shares for issuance upon exercise of Conectiv's Preferred Stock
Purchase Rights distributed to holders of Conectiv stock in connection with
Conectiv's stockholder rights agreement.

   HoldCo: HoldCo's authorized equity capitalization consists of     shares of
HoldCo common stock, par value $.01 per share, and     shares of preferred
stock, par value $    per share. Under the HoldCo certificate, the HoldCo Board
has the power to issue preferred stock and to designate its rights and
preferences, which might be superior to the rights of the HoldCo common stock.

Stockholder Action Without a Meeting

   Pepco: Under District of Columbia law, any action required or permitted to
be taken at a stockholders meeting may be taken without a meeting if a consent
in writing setting forth the action is signed by all stockholders entitled to
vote on that action, and such written consent is filed with the minutes of the
stockholders' meetings.

   Under Virginia law, any action required or permitted to be taken at a
stockholders meeting of a corporation with 300 or more stockholders may be
taken without a meeting and without action by the board of directors if the
action is taken by all the stockholders entitled to vote on that action, and is
evidenced by a writing describing the action taken, signed by all the
stockholders and delivered to the secretary of the corporation for inclusion in
the minutes of the stockholders' meetings.

   Conectiv and HoldCo: Under Delaware law, unless a corporation's certificate
of incorporation provides otherwise, any action required to be taken at any
annual or special stockholders' meeting may be taken without a meeting, without
prior notice and without a vote if approved by written consent of stockholders
with not less than the minimum number of votes necessary to take the action at
a meeting at which all shares entitled to vote on the action were present and
voted. Both the Conectiv certificate and the HoldCo certificate require
stockholder action to be effected at a meeting of stockholders and prohibit
stockholder action by written consent.

Stockholder Inspection Rights

   Pepco: The laws of the District of Columbia provide that any stockholder of
record of at least 5% of all the outstanding shares of a corporation will have
the right to examine, in person, or by agent or attorney, at any reasonable
time or times, for any proper purpose, its record of stockholders and to make
extracts from that record.

   Under Virginia law, a stockholder of a corporation is entitled to inspect
and copy, during regular business hours at the corporation's principal office,
minutes of stockholders' and directors' meetings, accounting records and
certain other records of the corporation if he gives the corporation written
notice of his demand at least 5 business days before the date on which he
wishes to inspect and copy. A stockholder may inspect and copy the records only
if he has been a stockholder of record for at least 6 months immediately
preceding his demand or is the holder of record of at least 5% of all the
outstanding shares, his demand is made in good faith and for a proper purpose,
he describes with reasonable particularity his purpose and the records he
desires to inspect, and the records are directly connected with his purpose.

   Conectiv and HoldCo: Delaware law provides that any stockholder of record,
in person or by attorney or other agent, upon a written demand under oath,
stating the stockholder's purpose, has the right during the usual hours for
business to inspect for any proper purpose the corporation's stock ledger, a
list of its stockholders, and its other books and records, and to make copies
or extracts from those records. A proper purpose means a purpose reasonably
related to the person's interest as a stockholder. In every instance where an
attorney or other agent is the person who seeks the right to inspection, the
demand under oath must be accompanied by a power of attorney or another writing
that authorizes the attorney or other agent to act on behalf of the
stockholder. The demand under oath must be directed to the corporation at its
registered office in Delaware or at its principal place of business.

Required Stockholder Votes for Certain Reorganizations

   Pepco: Under the laws of the District of Columbia, unless the articles of
incorporation require otherwise, a plan of merger or consolidation requires the
affirmative vote of the holders of two-thirds of the outstanding shares of each
class of stock of the corporation. The required stockholder vote can not be
reduced to less than a majority of the outstanding shares.

   Under Virginia law, a plan of merger must be approved by two-thirds of all
the votes entitled to be cast thereon by each voting group, provided that the
board of directors may require a greater vote and the articles of incorporation
may provide for a greater or lesser vote, so long as the vote provided for is
not less than a majority of all votes entitled to be cast by each voting group.

   Pepco's articles and Pepco's bylaws provide that, to approve an
extraordinary transaction, the affirmative vote of (1) the holders of two-
