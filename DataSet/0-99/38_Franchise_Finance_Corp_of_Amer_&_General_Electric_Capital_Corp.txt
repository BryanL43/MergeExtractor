DEAR SHAREHOLDER:

     On behalf of the board of directors, I cordially invite you to attend a
special meeting of shareholders of Franchise Finance Corporation of America to
be held at The Fairmont Scottsdale Princess, 7575 East Princess Drive,
Scottsdale, Arizona, on ________, _________, 2001, at 10:00 a.m., local time.

     At the special meeting, you will be asked to consider and vote to approve a
merger under which General Electric Capital Corporation would acquire Franchise
Finance Corporation of America, and you would be entitled to receive $25.00 in
cash for each share of FFCA common stock you hold. More detailed information
about the merger, the merger agreement and the related amendment to FFCA's
charter is in the accompanying proxy statement. A copy of the merger agreement
is attached as Appendix A to the proxy statement. You should carefully read the
accompanying material.

     THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS, AFTER CAREFUL CONSIDERATION, HAS DETERMINED THAT
THE MERGER IS ADVISABLE AND IN THE BEST INTERESTS OF FFCA AND ITS SHAREHOLDERS
AND HAS UNANIMOUSLY APPROVED THE MERGER, THE MERGER AGREEMENT AND THE RELATED
AMENDMENT TO FFCA'S CHARTER. THE BOARD RECOMMENDS THAT YOU VOTE "FOR" APPROVAL
OF THE MERGER AND THE RELATED AMENDMENT TO FFCA'S CHARTER.

     YOUR VOTE IS VERY IMPORTANT. To assure that your shares are represented at
the special meeting, please complete, sign and date the enclosed proxy card and
return it in the enclosed postage prepaid envelope as soon as possible. This
will allow your shares to be represented at the meeting whether or not you
attend the meeting. Returning your proxy card will not prevent you from voting
in person, but will assure that your vote will be counted if you are unable to
attend the meeting. It is important to note that the failure to submit a proxy
card or vote at the meeting will have the same effect as a vote against the
merger.

                                        Sincerely,

_______, 2001                           Morton H. Fleischer,
                                        Chairman of the Board and
                                        Chief Executive Officer

                    -----------------------------------------
                    NOTICE OF SPECIAL MEETING OF SHAREHOLDERS
                            TO BE HELD _______, 2001
                    -----------------------------------------

     NOTICE IS HEREBY GIVEN that a special meeting of shareholders (the
"Meeting") of Franchise Finance Corporation of America, a Maryland corporation
("FFCA"), will be held on ________, ______, 2001 at 10:00 a.m. local time, at
The Fairmont Scottsdale Princess, 7575 East Princess Drive, Scottsdale, Arizona
for the following purposes:

     1. To consider and vote upon a proposal to approve a merger and the related
amendment to FFCA's charter, as contemplated by the Agreement and Plan of
Merger, dated as of March 30, 2001, among General Electric Capital Corporation
("GE Capital"), Galahad Acquisition Corp., an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary
of GE Capital ("Merger Sub") and FFCA that will result in:

     *    Merger Sub merging with and into FFCA, with FFCA surviving the merger
          and becoming a wholly-owned subsidiary of GE Capital; and

     *    Each outstanding share of FFCA common stock held immediately prior to
          the effective time of the merger being converted into the right to
          receive $25.00 in cash, which may be reduced for persons subject to
          applicable withholding taxes.

     2. To transact such other business as may properly come before the Meeting
or any adjournment or postponement of the Meeting, including without limitation,
potential adjournments or postponements of the Meeting for the purpose of
soliciting additional proxies in order to approve the merger and related
amendment to FFCA's charter.

     Only those shareholders of record at the close of business on ________,
2001 will be entitled to notice of and to vote at the Meeting or any adjournment
or postponement of the Meeting. All shareholders, whether or not they expect to
attend the Meeting in person, are urged to sign, date and return the enclosed
proxy card as promptly as possible in the postage prepaid envelope enclosed for
that purpose. Shareholders who attend the Meeting may revoke a prior proxy and
vote in person as set forth in the proxy statement.

     Your attention is directed to the proxy statement accompanying this notice
for a more complete statement regarding the matters proposed to be acted on at
the special meeting. A copy of the merger agreement is attached as Appendix A to
the accompanying proxy statement.

     THE ENCLOSED PROXY IS BEING SOLICITED BY THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS OF THE
COMPANY. THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS RECOMMENDS THAT YOU VOTE "FOR" APPROVAL OF THE
MERGER AND THE RELATED AMENDMENT TO FFCA'S CHARTER.

     Please do not send your FFCA common stock certificates to FFCA with your
proxy card. If the merger is completed, you will receive a letter containing
instructions for the surrender of your FFCA common stock certificates for
payment.

                                        By Order of the Board of Directors

Scottsdale, Arizona                     Dennis L. Ruben,
Dated:  ______ __, 2001                 Secretary

                               SUMMARY TERM SHEET

     The following summary briefly describes the material terms of the proposed
acquisition of FFCA by GE Capital. While this summary describes the material
terms that you should consider when evaluating the merger, the attached proxy
statement contains a more detailed description of the terms of the merger. You
should carefully read the proxy statement in its entirety before voting. We have
included section references to direct you to a more complete description of the
topics described in this summary.

Q:   HOW MUCH WILL I RECEIVE FOR MY SHARES OF FFCA COMMON STOCK IN THE MERGER?

A:   If the merger is completed, you will receive $25.00 per share in cash (less
     applicable withholding taxes, if any) for each share of FFCA common stock
     you own at the time of the merger and you will have no interest in the
     surviving corporation. The total consideration to be paid to FFCA
     shareholders in the merger will be approximately $1.4 billion. See "THE
     MERGER AGREEMENT - Conversion of FFCA Common Stock."

Q:   WILL I HAVE TO PAY TAXES ON THE $25.00 PER SHARE I RECEIVE IN THE MERGER?

A:   The receipt of cash in the merger will generally be a taxable transaction
     to you in the same way as if you sold your shares for $25.00 per share in
     cash. See "THE MERGER - Material Federal Income Tax Considerations."

Q:   WHAT WILL HAPPEN TO FFCA AND ITS SHAREHOLDERS IN THE MERGER?

A:   As a result of the merger:

     *    FFCA, the surviving corporation in the merger, will become a
          wholly-owned subsidiary of GE Capital;

     *    FFCA shareholders will receive cash in exchange for their shares and
          will no longer have any interest in the future earnings or growth of
          FFCA;

     *    FFCA will no longer be a public company; and

     *    FFCA's common stock will no longer be listed or traded on the New York
          Stock Exchange.

See "THE MERGER AGREEMENT."

Q:   WILL I CONTINUE TO RECEIVE REGULAR QUARTERLY DIVIDENDS?

A:   FFCA will continue to pay regular quarterly dividends until the merger is
     completed. In addition, a special pro-rated dividend will be paid for the
     partial quarterly period, if any, ending on the day prior to the merger.
     Once the merger is completed, you will no longer receive any dividends for
     any period following the effective time of the merger. See "THE MERGER -
     Effects of the Merger."

Q:   HOW DOES FFCA'S BOARD OF DIRECTORS RECOMMEND I VOTE?

A:   FFCA's board of directors has determined that the merger, the merger
     agreement and the related amendment to FFCA's charter are advisable and in
     the best interests of FFCA and its shareholders, and

     recommends that you approve the merger and the related amendment to FFCA's
     charter. FFCA's board of directors and executive officers and their
     affiliates, who intend to vote "FOR" approval of the merger, together owned
     approximately __% of FFCA's outstanding common stock as of the record date.
     In addition, Colony SB, LLC, which under an investor's agreement with FFCA
     has the right to nominate one member of FFCA's board of directors, has
     indicated that it intends to vote "FOR" approval of the merger. As of the
     record date, Colony owned approximately __% of FFCA's outstanding common
     stock. See "THE MERGER - Recommendation of the Board."

Q:   HAS AN OUTSIDE PARTY GIVEN ITS OPINION AS TO THE FAIRNESS OF THE MERGER
     CONSIDERATION?

A:   FFCA's board of directors received an opinion from Merrill Lynch, Pierce,
     Fenner & Smith Incorporated, its financial advisor, to the effect that as
     of the date of the opinion and subject to the assumptions, limitations and
     qualifications contained in the opinion, the merger consideration of $25.00
     per share in cash to be received by shareholders of FFCA for their FFCA
     common stock is fair to the shareholders from a financial point of view.
     See "THE MERGER - Opinion of FFCA's Financial Advisor" and "APPENDIX B."

Q:   ARE THERE ANY CONDITIONS TO COMPLETION OF THE MERGER?

A:   In addition to FFCA shareholder approval, the merger is also subject to the
     following conditions:

     *    FFCA must sell all of the properties it owns that contain underground
          storage tanks used to store gasoline (which currently number 178) and
          three additional properties which have specified environmental
          conditions present, at aggregate net sales prices that are at least as
          high as the prices determined by a formula separately agreed to by
          FFCA and GE Capital;
     *    The absence of specified material adverse changes affecting FFCA or in
          specified tax laws that affect FFCA;
     *    There must not be a continuing 25% decline in the NYSE composite index
          since March 30, 2001 or a continuing general suspension of trading on
          the NYSE; and
     *    Other customary closing conditions and regulatory approvals.

See "THE MERGER AGREEMENT - Conditions to the Merger."

Q:   WHAT VOTE IS REQUIRED TO APPROVE THE MERGER?

A:   The merger and related charter amendment must be approved by the
     affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of
     FFCA common stock on the record date, or ________ shares. We urge you to
     complete, execute and return the enclosed proxy card to assure the
     representation of your shares at the meeting. See "THE SPECIAL MEETING -
     Quorum and Vote Required."

Q:   WHAT RIGHTS DO I HAVE IF I OPPOSE THE MERGER?

A:   You can vote against the merger by indicating a vote against the proposal
     on your proxy card and signing and mailing your proxy card, or by voting
     against the merger in person at the meeting. Failure to submit a proxy or
     vote at the meeting will have the same effect as a vote against the merger.
     Under Maryland law, since FFCA's shares are listed on the NYSE, FFCA
     dissenting shareholders do not have the right to receive the appraised
     value of their shares in connection with the proposed merger. If you do not
     vote in favor of the proposed merger and it takes place anyway, you will be
     bound by the terms of the merger agreement.

Q:   WHEN AND WHERE WILL THE SPECIAL MEETING BE HELD?

A:   The special meeting will be held at The Fairmont Scottsdale Princess, 7575
     East Princess Drive, Scottsdale, Arizona, on ________, ________ __, 2001,
     at 10:00 a.m., local time. See "THE SPECIAL MEETING."

Q:   WHO CAN VOTE?

A:   Only shareholders of record as of the close of business on _______ __, 2001
     may vote at the meeting. See "THE SPECIAL MEETING - Record Date and Voting
     Power."

Q:   WHAT OTHER MATTERS WILL BE VOTED ON AT THE SPECIAL MEETING?

A:   Maryland law and FFCA's bylaws do not permit any other matters to be
     presented at the special meeting except related procedural matters,
     including adjournment of the meeting to a later date.

Q:   HOW CAN I VOTE SHARES HELD IN MY BROKER'S NAME?

A:   If your broker or another nominee holds your shares in its name (or in what
     is commonly called "street name"), then you should give your broker or
     nominee instructions on how to vote. Otherwise, your shares will not be
     voted and will have the same effect as a vote against the merger.
     Directions for instructing your broker are included on your proxy card. See
     "THE SPECIAL MEETING - Proxies, Voting and Revocation."

Q:   CAN I CHANGE MY VOTE?

A:   You may change your vote at any time before the vote is tabulated at the
     meeting. For shares held directly in your name, you may do this by sending
     a new proxy or a written revocation to FFCA's secretary or by attending the
     meeting and voting there. Attending the meeting alone will not change the
     vote in the proxy you sent, unless you vote at the meeting. For shares held
     in "street name," you may change your vote only by giving new voting
     instructions to your broker or nominee. See "THE SPECIAL MEETING - Proxies,
     Voting and Revocation."

Q:   WHAT SHOULD I DO NOW?

A:   Please vote. If you mail your completed, signed and dated proxy card in the
     enclosed envelope as soon as possible, your shares will be voted at the
     meeting even if you are unable to attend. No postage is required if the
     proxy card is returned in the enclosed postage prepaid envelope and mailed
     in the United States.

Q:   WHAT DOES IT MEAN IF I RECEIVE MORE THAN ONE PROXY OR VOTING INSTRUCTION
     CARD?

A:   It means your shares are registered differently or are held in more than
     one account. Please complete, sign, date and mail each proxy card that you
     receive.

Q:   SHOULD I SEND IN MY STOCK CERTIFICATES NOW?

A:   No. After the merger is completed, we will send you written instructions
     that will tell you how to exchange your certificates for $25.00 per share
     in cash. PLEASE DO NOT SEND IN YOUR CERTIFICATES NOW OR WITH YOUR PROXIES.
     Hold your certificates until you receive further instructions.

Q:   WHAT HAPPENS IF I SELL MY SHARES BEFORE THE SPECIAL MEETING?

A:   The record date for the meeting is earlier than the expected completion
     date of the merger. If you held your shares on the record date, but have
     transferred those shares after the record date and before the merger, you
     will retain your right to vote at the meeting, but not the right to receive
     the merger consideration. The right to receive the merger consideration
     will pass to the person to whom you transferred your shares. In addition,
     the person to whom you transferred your shares will generally have the
     ability to revoke any proxy you grant and grant a proxy of their own at any
     time before the special meeting takes place.

Q:   WHO SHOULD I CONTACT IF I HAVE QUESTIONS ABOUT THE MERGER OR NEED
     ADDITIONAL COPIES OF THE PROXY STATEMENT?

A:   If you have more questions about the merger or would like additional copies
     of the attached proxy statement, you should contact Georgeson Shareholder
     Communications, 17 State Street, 10th Floor, New York, New York 10004,
     Telephone: (___) ___-____.

________ __, 2001, at 10:00 a.m., local time, at The Fairmont Scottsdale

     As of ______ __, 2001, the record date, FFCA had _________ shares of common
stock outstanding. Only shareholders of record at the close of business on the

     FFCA'S BOARD OF DIRECTORS HAS UNANIMOUSLY APPROVED THE MERGER, THE MERGER

MERGER DESCRIPTION

     THE MERGER STRUCTURE. The merger agreement provides that Merger Sub will be
merged with and into FFCA. The merger will become effective when the articles of
merger have been filed with and accepted by the State Department of Assessments
and Taxation of the State of Maryland in accordance with the Maryland General
Corporation Law, or at a subsequent time as GE Capital and FFCA agree and
specify in the articles of merger. At that time, Merger Sub will be merged with
and into FFCA and will cease to exist as a separate entity, and FFCA will become
a subsidiary of GE Capital. FFCA expects the merger to become effective as soon
as practicable after the approval of the merger by FFCA's shareholders and the
satisfaction or waiver of all other conditions to the merger. See "THE MERGER
AGREEMENT - The Merger Structure."

     WHAT YOU WILL RECEIVE IN THE MERGER. At the effective time of the merger,
each issued and outstanding share of FFCA common stock will be converted into
the right to receive $25.00 in cash, which may be reduced for persons subject to
applicable withholding taxes. See "THE MERGER AGREEMENT - Conversion of FFCA
Common Stock."

     YOU SHOULD NOT SEND IN YOUR FFCA COMMON STOCK CERTIFICATES UNTIL YOU
RECEIVE A LETTER OF TRANSMITTAL.

     QUARTERLY DIVIDENDS. Regular quarterly dividends will be paid by FFCA until
the merger is completed. In addition, a special pro-rated dividend will be paid
for the partial quarterly period, if any, ending on the day prior to the merger.
Once the merger is completed, you will no longer receive any dividends for any
period following the effective time of the merger.

     RECOMMENDATION OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS OF FFCA. FFCA's board of directors
believes that the merger, the merger agreement and the related amendment to
FFCA's charter are advisable and in the best interests of FFCA and its
shareholders, and recommends that you vote "FOR" the proposal to approve the
merger and the related amendment to FFCA's charter. See "THE MERGER -
Recommendation of the Board."

     BACKGROUND AND REASONS FOR THE MERGER. In making the determination to
approve the merger, the merger agreement and the related amendment to FFCA's
charter, FFCA's board of directors considered various factors and alternatives
to the merger, including those described under the headings "THE MERGER -
Background of the Merger," and "- Reasons for the Merger; Factors Considered."

     OPINION OF FINANCIAL ADVISOR TO FFCA. In connection with the merger, FFCA's
board of directors received an opinion from FFCA's financial advisor, Merrill
Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated, as to the fairness, from a financial
point of view, of the merger consideration to FFCA's shareholders. Merrill
Lynch's written opinion, dated March 29, 2001, is attached to this proxy
statement as Appendix B. We encourage you to carefully read this opinion in its
entirety for a description of the procedures followed, assumptions made, matters
considered and limitations on the review undertaken by Merrill Lynch in
providing its opinion.

     Merrill Lynch's fairness opinion is addressed to the FFCA board of
directors and does not address the merits of the underlying decision by FFCA to
engage in the merger and does not constitute a recommendation to any shareholder
as to how any shareholder should vote on the merger. See "THE MERGER - Opinion
of FFCA's Financial Advisor."

     INTERESTS OF CERTAIN PERSONS IN THE MERGER. Some of the directors and
officers of FFCA have interests in the merger that are different from, or in
addition to, your interests as a shareholder. These interests may relate to or
arise from, among other things, option and restricted stock payments and
change-in-control payments. For the FFCA officers, these interests may also
include compensation received from the surviving company following the merger.
See "THE MERGER - Interests of Directors and Officers in the Merger" for a more
detailed description of these interests.

     As of the record date, FFCA's executive officers and directors owned stock
options to acquire _____ shares of FFCA common stock. Although the shares that
may be acquired by exercising the options can not be voted at the meeting, these
officers and directors will receive cash payments for options with an exercise
price of less than $25.00 per share (the per share merger consideration) if the
merger is completed.

     As of the record date, FFCA's directors and executive officers and their
affiliates, who intend to vote "FOR" approval of the merger, beneficially owned
an aggregate of ______ shares of FFCA common stock, representing approximately
___% of the shares of FFCA common stock outstanding on the record date. In
addition, Colony SB, LLC, which under an investor's agreement with FFCA has the
right to nominate one member of FFCA's board of directors, has indicated it
intends to vote "FOR" approval of

the merger. As of the record date, Colony owned approximately __% of FFCA's
outstanding common stock.

     DISSENTERS' RIGHTS. Under Maryland law, since FFCA's shares are listed on
the NYSE, dissenting FFCA shareholders do not have the right to receive the
appraised value of their shares in connection with the proposed merger. There
are no dissenters' or appraisal rights offered in the merger agreement or
otherwise in connection with the merger.

SPECIAL MEETING AND VOTING

     THE SPECIAL MEETING. The special meeting of the shareholders will be held
at The Fairmont Scottsdale Princess, 7575 East Princess Drive, Scottsdale,
Arizona on ________ __, 2001, at 10.00 a.m., local time. At the meeting, FFCA's
shareholders will be asked to consider and vote upon a proposal to approve the
merger and the related amendment to FFCA's charter. See "THE SPECIAL MEETING."

     RECORD DATE AND VOTING POWER. FFCA's board of directors has fixed the close
of business on ___________ __, 2001 as the record date for determining
shareholders entitled to notice of, and to vote at, the meeting. As of the
record date, FFCA had ________ shares of common stock outstanding, held by
approximately _______ shareholders of record. FFCA has no other class of voting
securities outstanding. Shareholders of record on the record date will be
entitled to one vote per share of common stock on any matter that may properly
come before the meeting and any adjournment or postponement of the meeting. See
"THE SPECIAL MEETING - Record Date and Voting Power."

     QUORUM AND VOTE REQUIRED. FFCA's bylaws require (1) the presence, in person
or by duly executed proxy, of shares representing at least a majority of the
votes entitled to be cast at the meeting in order to constitute a quorum, and
(2) the affirmative vote of shares representing at least a majority of the votes
entitled to be cast at the meeting in order to approve the merger and related
amendment to FFCA's charter. Failure to return your proxy or direct your broker
or nominee how to vote your proxy will have the same effect as a vote against
the merger. See "THE SPECIAL MEETING - Quorum and Vote Required."

     PROXIES, VOTING AND REVOCATION. Shares represented at the meeting by
properly executed proxies received prior to or at the meeting and not revoked
will be voted at the meeting, and at any adjournments or postponements of the
meeting, in accordance with the instructions on the proxies. If a proxy is duly
executed and submitted without instructions, except for broker non-votes, the
shares represented by that proxy will be voted "FOR" the approval of the merger
and the related amendment to FFCA's charter. Proxies are being solicited on
behalf of FFCA's board of directors.

     A proxy may be revoked by the person who executed it at, or before, the
meeting by: (1) delivering to FFCA's secretary a written notice of revocation of
a previously-delivered proxy bearing a later date than the proxy; (2) duly
executing, dating and delivering to FFCA's secretary a subsequently dated proxy;
or (3) attending the meeting and voting in person. Attendance at the meeting
will not, by itself, constitute revocation of a proxy. See "THE SPECIAL MEETING
- - Proxies, Voting and Revocation."

     FFCA will bear its own cost of solicitation of proxies. FFCA will reimburse
brokerage houses, fiduciaries, nominees and others for their out-of-pocket
expenses in forwarding proxy materials to beneficial owners of FFCA common stock
held in their names. FFCA has retained the services of Georgeson Shareholder
Communications to assist in the solicitation. Fees for these services are
estimated to be approximately $25,000 plus reimbursement of reasonable
out-of-pocket expenses, which are estimated to be approximately $75,000.

     BROKER VOTES. Shares held in the name of your broker or a nominee, or in
"street name," will not be voted by your broker or nominee unless you provide
instructions on how to vote. Your broker or nominee will provide you directions
regarding how to instruct your broker or nominee to vote your shares. Without
your instructions, your shares will not be voted, which will have the same
effect as a vote against the merger and related amendment to FFCA's charter.

shareholder's adjusted tax basis in the stock. This transaction may also be
taxable for state, local or foreign tax purposes. See "THE MERGER - Material
Federal Income Tax Considerations."

     BECAUSE INDIVIDUAL CIRCUMSTANCES MAY DIFFER, EACH SHAREHOLDER IS URGED TO
CONSULT HIS OR HER OWN TAX ADVISOR TO DETERMINE THE PARTICULAR TAX EFFECTS OF
THE MERGER, INCLUDING THE APPLICATION AND EFFECT OF STATE, LOCAL AND OTHER TAX
LAWS.

     REGULATORY MATTERS. The Hart-Scott-Rodino Act requires FFCA and GE Capital
to furnish information and materials to the Antitrust Division of the Department
of Justice and the Federal Trade Commission and requires a 30-day waiting period
to expire or be terminated before the merger can be completed. FFCA and GE
Capital filed the required information on April 10, 2001 and the waiting period
was terminated early on April 13, 2001. See "THE MERGER - Hart-Scott-Rodino

RECORD DATE AND VOTING POWER

     FFCA's board of directors has fixed the close of business on ____________,
2001 as the record date for the determination of shareholders entitled to notice
of, and to vote at, the meeting. As of the record date, there were __________
shares of FFCA common stock outstanding, held by approximately ______
shareholders. FFCA's common stock is FFCA's only outstanding class of capital
stock. Shareholders of record on the record date will be entitled to one vote

QUORUM AND VOTE REQUIRED

     FFCA's bylaws require (1) the presence, in person or by duly executed
proxy, of the holders of shares of common stock representing at least a majority
of the votes entitled to be cast at the meeting in order to constitute a quorum
and (2) the affirmative vote of the holders of shares of FFCA common stock
representing a majority of the votes entitled to be cast at the meeting in order
to approve the merger and related transactions. For purposes only of determining
the presence or absence of a quorum for the transaction of business, abstentions

PROXIES, VOTING AND REVOCATION

     Shares of common stock represented at the special meeting by properly
executed proxies received prior to, or at, the special meeting, and not revoked,
will be voted at the special meeting, and at any adjournment or postponement of
that meeting, in accordance with the instructions on those proxies. If a proxy
is duly executed and submitted without instructions, except for broker
non-votes, the shares of common stock represented by that proxy will be voted
"FOR" the approval of the merger and related amendment to FFCA's charter.
Proxies are being solicited on behalf of the board of directors. Shares held in
the name of your broker, or in "street name," will be voted by your broker
according to your instructions. Your broker will provide you directions
regarding how to instruct your broker to vote your shares.

     A proxy may be revoked at any time before it is voted at the special
meeting. A proxy may be revoked by the person who executed it at, or before, the
special meeting by:

     *    delivering to FFCA's secretary a written notice of revocation of a
          previously-delivered proxy bearing a later date than the proxy;

     *    duly executing, dating and delivering to FFCA's secretary a subsequent
          proxy; or

     *    attending the meeting and voting in person. Attendance at the meeting
          will not, by itself, constitute revocation of a previously delivered
          proxy. The shareholder must also vote in person to revoke the
          previously granted proxy.

     Any written notice revoking a proxy should be delivered to: Dennis L.
Ruben, Secretary, Franchise Finance Corporation of America, 17207 North
Perimeter Drive, Scottsdale, Arizona 85255. Shareholders that have instructed a
broker to vote their shares must follow directions received from such broker in
order to change their vote or to vote at the FFCA special meeting.

     FFCA will bear its own cost of solicitation of proxies. FFCA will reimburse
brokerage houses, fiduciaries, nominees and others for their out-of-pocket
expenses in forwarding proxy materials to beneficial owners of FFCA common stock
held in their names. FFCA has retained the services of Georgeson Shareholder
Communications to assist in the solicitation. Fees for these services are
estimated to be approximately $25,000 plus reasonable out-of-pocket expenses,
which are estimated to be approximately $75,000. Original solicitation of
proxies by mail may also be supplemented by telephone or personal solicitation
by FFCA's directors, officers or other regular employees of FFCA. No additional
compensation will be paid to FFCA's directors, officers or other regular
employees for these services.

                                   THE MERGER

BACKGROUND OF THE MERGER

     Beginning in early 1999, FFCA's senior management commenced a strategic
review of its then current method of operations. At that time, FFCA's method of
operations had been changing with a greater emphasis on loan securitizations and
fee-based services. In addition, new business opportunities were being
identified which were not related to the passive ownership of real estate. The
Tax Code limits FFCA's ability to pursue many of these future growth
opportunities because of FFCA's status as a REIT. At the same time, FFCA was
facing competition from existing and new sources. In addition, the capital
markets that FFCA participated in for funding new financings were undergoing
changes. The effects on

FFCA's operations of these changes in the capital markets, competition and REIT
provisions of the Tax Code are discussed in more detail below.

     CAPITAL MARKETS. Since FFCA's organization as a REIT in 1994, FFCA has
relied principally on four external sources of capital to fund new investments:
loan securitizations, whole loan sales, corporate borrowings and the sale of
common stock. As described below, each of these capital sources presented, and
continues to present, unique challenges that FFCA believes may limit FFCA's
operating results and stock market performance in the future.

     *    LOAN SECURITIZATIONS. Since 1994, FFCA's largest source of capital has
          been through the securitization of loans. In these securitizations,
          FFCA's loans are transferred to a trust that issues trust certificates
          or other securities that are then sold to institutional investors.
          FFCA believes that the securitization markets may not be a reliable
          and competitive source of capital for FFCA in the future since the
          number of purchasers for securities issued in this type of transaction
          is becoming more limited and there have been recent loan delinquencies
          in comparable securitizations that were sponsored by parties other
          than FFCA. In addition, future reliance on loan securitizations to
          fund substantial investments by FFCA will likely result in a greater
          percentage of FFCA's assets being comprised of subordinated
          securitization securities that FFCA retains when it enters into a
          securitization transaction. The cash flows from, and value of, these
          subordinated securitization securities can be volatile. FFCA also
          believes that further material increases in the amount of subordinated
          securitization securities it holds may negatively affect FFCA's
          corporate debt ratings in the future, making it more difficult to
          raise capital through the issuance of debt.

     *    WHOLE LOAN SALES. In 2000, FFCA commenced a whole loan sale program as
          a result of the execution of a loan sale agreement and servicing
          agreement with Washington Mutual Bank, FA. Under this program, a
          taxable REIT subsidiary of FFCA receives income from the origination
          and sale of loans, as well as continuing revenue from FFCA's servicing
          of the loans after they are sold. Under the loan sale agreement, which
          is scheduled to expire on December 31, 2002, Washington Mutual is not
          obligated to and does not purchase all loans originated by FFCA.
          During 2000, Washington Mutual purchased approximately half of the
          loans FFCA originated. In addition, the purchase of loans under the
          loan sale agreement is subject to borrower credit concentration
          limits. Washington Mutual has recently informally indicated to FFCA
          that it intends to reduce these concentration limits. This recent
          indication by Washington Mutual will require FFCA to continue to
          develop the use of other capital sources to fund new investments.
          Although whole loan sales permit FFCA to conduct business without the
          need for additional capital, FFCA believes there are risks in
          substantially relying on whole loan sales as a source of capital in
          the future since the sale of loans to Washington Mutual or other
          institutional investors is not under FFCA's complete control. In
          addition, FFCA believes that whole loan sales have increased the
          volatility of FFCA's funds from operations ("FFO"), making FFCA's
          future growth more difficult for investors to evaluate. As a result,
          FFCA believes that investors may discount FFCA's ability to originate
          and sell loans in the future in amounts sufficient to achieve
          acceptable increases in FFO, which may negatively affect the market
          price of FFCA's stock. In addition, governmentally regulated financial
          institutions may be subject to regulations which may restrict or limit
          their ability to purchase franchise loans. These restrictions, if
          increased, could negatively affect FFCA's ability to sell loans in the
          future.

     *    CORPORATE BORROWINGS. As of March 31, 2001, FFCA had investment-grade
          debt ratings of BBB, Baa2 and BBB- from Fitch, Moody's and Standard
          and Poor's, respectively. FFCA believes that favorable credit ratings
          are essential to make additional borrowings at favorable rates in the
          future and strongly influence FFCA's costs of shorter-term credit
          lines. FFCA also believes a material

          increase in the amount of subordinated securitization securities it
          holds from entering into securitization transactions as described
          above could negatively affect FFCA's corporate credit ratings and
          result in reduced financial flexibility and greater shareholder risk
          in the future. Incurring debt to fund increasing origination volumes
          without accessing new equity capital presents difficulties for FFCA
          because FFCA is required to maintain specified debt-to-equity ratios
          under various agreements.

     *    COMMON STOCK. Since January 1997, the market price of FFCA's common
          stock has declined as a multiple of the estimate of FFCA's projected
          FFO by security analysts that follow FFCA's stock. As a result of
          FFCA's lower FFO trading multiples, FFCA currently believes that the
          issuance of its common stock would result in the dilution of its
          shareholders or would not achieve an acceptable rate of return. Since
          the amount of corporate debt which FFCA may issue is limited by
          covenants relating to FFCA's debt-to-equity ratio, FFCA's inability to
          issue common stock at appropriate prices effectively limits its
          ability to issue debt to fund financing activities, thereby reducing
          corporate financial flexibility and competitiveness in the future.

     COMPETITIVE ENVIRONMENT. Over the past several years, FFCA has encountered
competition in FFCA's principal business of financing chain stores from large,
diversified financial institutions competing in FFCA's market. FFCA believes
that these diversified financial institutions have competitive advantages over
FFCA because of their lower cost and greater availability of capital as compared
to FFCA. Higher capital costs limit FFCA's ability to offer financing at rates
similar to those offered by diversified financial institutions and could
restrict FFCA's growth.

     REIT STATUS. In order to maintain FFCA's status as a REIT under the Tax
Code, a substantial majority of FFCA's income and assets must be derived from
passive real estate activities. Income from whole loan sales, servicing third
parties' loan portfolios and the sale of products and services to chain store
operators (such as insurance products and personnel services) are not qualifying
income under the REIT provisions of the Tax Code. As a result, FFCA believes
that the REIT provisions of the Tax Code could limit its business opportunities
in the future.

     CHRONOLOGY. In light of these business issues, FFCA's senior management,
with the concurrence of its board of directors, retained Merrill Lynch & Co. and
Bear, Stearns & Co., Inc. during the first quarter of 1999 to act as FFCA's
financial advisors. The financial advisors were retained to review FFCA's
position in its industry and strategic alternatives, and to identify companies
which would potentially be interested in a merger, consolidation, reorganization
or other strategic business transaction with FFCA.

     On April 7, 1999, at a special meeting of FFCA's board of directors,
representatives of Merrill Lynch and Bear Stearns discussed the state of the
commercial finance industry and the valuation of commercial finance companies,
and reviewed their process for identifying strategic alternatives for FFCA. At
that meeting, the law firm of Simpson Thacher & Bartlett was retained as special
counsel to FFCA and representatives of that firm reviewed with the board its
legal duties in connection with the exploration of strategic alternatives.
Representatives of Simpson Thacher & Bartlett also reviewed the terms of a
proposed shareholders' rights agreement for FFCA, which was adopted by the board
of directors at that meeting. At that meeting, the board also authorized the
compensation committee of the board to consider the adoption of
change-in-control or similar agreements to provide appropriate protection and
incentives for FFCA's senior management and other key employees of FFCA to
continue their employment with FFCA in light of FFCA's exploration of strategic
alternatives. The board of directors also authorized the financial advisors to
solicit indications of interest from third parties for a possible transaction
with FFCA.

     Following the April 7, 1999 meeting, Merrill Lynch and Bear Stearns
identified potential purchasers and joint venture partners to be contacted.
Initially, approximately 25 companies were identified and contacted. These
companies were selected based upon their market capitalization, cost of and
access to capital and interest and/or participation in FFCA's targeted industry.
These companies included diversified finance companies, foreign and domestic
depository institutions and insurance companies. Of these 25 companies, 14
companies signed confidentiality and standstill agreements, following which
information regarding FFCA was provided to them. Following the initial review of
FFCA's confidential material, only two of these 14 interested companies
expressed non-binding indications of interest to continue discussions with FFCA
relating to the purchase of all of the common stock of FFCA. FFCA believes,
based on the various discussions held with the interested companies and with the
other contacted parties, that the limited number of interested parties was
primarily a result of FFCA's large size and its unique mix of assets. In
addition, FFCA believes that many of the potential purchasers did not pursue an
acquisition of FFCA because FFCA's assets were limited to a single asset class
or loan type which exceeded the loan concentration policies of the potential
purchasers or exceeded limits placed on those entities by federal and state
regulators. FFCA's direct ownership of real estate creates obstacles for
financial institutions in acquiring FFCA because those institutions are subject
to regulation by federal and state banking authorities that prevent the
institutions from acquiring real estate asset portfolios like FFCA's portfolio.

     On April 29, 1999 and May 7, 1999, the compensation committee of the board
of directors held meetings and received advice from representatives of Hewitt
Associates, independent compensation consultants to FFCA, and representatives of
Simpson Thacher & Bartlett regarding proposals for continuity
(change-in-control) agreements to be entered into with FFCA's executive officers
and other senior managers. No action was taken by the compensation committee at
these meetings.

     At a regularly scheduled meeting held on May 12, 1999, the board of
directors, upon the recommendation of the compensation committee which met
earlier on the same date, approved and adopted the proposed change-in-control
program for FFCA's management in order to provide management with appropriate
protection and incentives to continue their employment with FFCA. At that
meeting, Morton H. Fleischer, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of FFCA,
reviewed with and updated the board of directors as to the status of the
financial advisors' and management's efforts regarding a strategic transaction,
including the number of parties contacted and the difficulties the contacted
parties expressed in pursuing a possible transaction with FFCA.

     On May 19 and May 26, 1999, FFCA received separate written non-binding
indications of interest from GE Capital and another party expressing preliminary
interest in pursuing a transaction with FFCA. In order to complete a transaction
with FFCA, the other potential acquiror indicated that additional parties would
be required to participate with it in the transaction. The other potential
acquiror did not continue negotiations with FFCA with respect to the
acquisition.

     During May and June of 1999, GE Capital conducted its initial due diligence
review of FFCA's operations in Scottsdale, Arizona.

     After further due diligence, on July 12, 1999, FFCA received a subsequent
non-binding indication of interest from GE Capital to purchase all of FFCA's
outstanding common stock, identifying a number of significant conditions to the
signing and completion of a transaction, including continued due diligence
review, negotiation of a mutually satisfactory merger agreement, receipt of a
private letter ruling from the Internal Revenue Service as to FFCA's retention
of its REIT status for the year in which the then proposed GE Capital
acquisition would occur in a form satisfactory to GE Capital, execution of
employment agreements with various members of FFCA's management and defeasance
or repayment of FFCA's then outstanding debt. At the same time that this
expression of interest was made, Weil,

Gotshal & Manges LLP, GE Capital's legal counsel, distributed written comments,
reflecting GE Capital's proposal including the conditions listed above, to the
form of merger agreement prepared by FFCA's counsel. Mr. Fleischer individually
advised the members of the board of FFCA's receipt of and terms of this
indication of interest. FFCA, with the concurrence of its board, decided to
further pursue this indication of interest and directed its financial and legal
advisors to continue negotiations and due diligence activities with GE Capital
and its advisors.

     During July through September 1999, FFCA and its advisors continued the
diligence and negotiation efforts with GE Capital and its advisors, attempting
to resolve the various open issues between the parties, including the purchase
price and the conditions contained in GE Capital's proposal.

     On July 30 and August 9, 1999, at meetings of the board of directors, Mr.
Fleischer advised the board on the current status of the proposed transaction
with GE Capital, and representatives of the financial advisors reviewed with the
board the results of their efforts to solicit interest in a strategic
transaction, including the fact that an initial list of approximately 25
companies was contacted, 14 companies signed confidentiality and standstill
agreements and received confidential materials and two companies had submitted
non-binding indications of interest and conducted further due diligence. Except
for the July 12, 1999 subsequent non-binding indication from GE Capital, no
other subsequent indications of interest were received. The board of directors
instructed the company and its advisors to continue their efforts.

     During August 1999, FFCA's senior management met with representatives of
Morgan Stanley Dean Witter to discuss strategic alternatives to the proposed
acquisition by GE Capital. Morgan Stanley was contacted because of its knowledge
of FFCA's securitization transactions, and in particular, the cash flows
generated by FFCA's assets. In addition, Morgan Stanley was at that time
generally regarded as the leading investment baking firm with respect to
franchise loan securitizations. Morgan Stanley has been the primary investment
banker for FFCA's recent mortgage loan securitization transactions, and as a
result, has significant knowledge and experience relating to the cash flows
generated by FFCA's assets. Following these discussions, at the direction of
FFCA, Morgan Stanley conducted extensive portfolio modeling to review the
potential for funding a corporate recapitalization and new business through
significant mortgage securitization transactions. The portfolio modeling
consisted of a review and analysis of the cash flow generated by FFCA's assets
and estimated future financings. These strategic alternatives were not pursued
by FFCA because of their reliance on a single funding strategy within
increasingly volatile capital markets.

     On September 17, 1999, at a special meeting of the board, representatives
of Merrill Lynch and Bear Stearns reviewed with the board the current status of
negotiations with GE Capital. In addition, FFCA's counsel reviewed the current
draft of the merger agreement with respect to the significant issues which
remained unresolved. At that meeting, representatives of Merrill Lynch and Bear
Stearns also advised the board of directors regarding structural alternatives to
a sale of FFCA. FFCA's senior management previously requested that the advisors
review these alternatives so that the board could consider all possible
alternatives to a sale of FFCA. These alternatives included:

     *    the creation of a taxable corporation whose stock would be distributed
          to FFCA shareholders in a spin-off transaction;
     *    the organization of a taxable corporation as one of FFCA's
          subsidiaries; and
     *    the organization of a taxable corporation with a real estate
          investment trust as a subsidiary.

The proposed purpose of forming these corporations was to isolate in a separate
taxable corporation the activities that would create income that would not
qualify under the REIT provisions of the Tax Code in order to give FFCA greater
operational flexibility. Although no action was taken at this time with respect

to any alternatives, the board directed FFCA and its advisors to continue
negotiating with GE Capital and its advisors while also investigating
alternative operating structures available to FFCA.

     Following this meeting, negotiations and due diligence with GE Capital
continued with respect to the proposed transaction, but the parties were unable
to resolve numerous issues with respect to GE Capital's acquisition of FFCA. In
addition, FFCA and its advisors continued to pursue operating structures which
presented alternatives to a sale of FFCA.

     On October 29, 1999, at a special meeting of the board, representatives of
Merrill Lynch, Bear Stearns and FFCA's legal advisors reported to the board on
the status of negotiations with GE Capital, including the inability of the
parties to reach agreement on the unresolved issues and various conditions
contained in GE Capital's proposal. Following discussion, the board declined to
pursue GE Capital's proposal and decided to terminate negotiations with GE
Capital at that time. The board directed its financial advisors to inform GE
Capital and its advisors of the board's decision. The board's decision was based
in part on the difficulties of the parties in reaching agreement on the terms
and conditions for a transaction and on the existence of other alternatives the
board believed were available to potentially enhance FFCA's liquidity and access
to capital, including the origination and sale of whole loans to third parties,
specifically under a proposed whole loan sale program with Washington Mutual
Bank, FA.

     On December 10, 1999, the board held a special meeting to approve the terms
of a whole loan sale program under a proposed loan purchase agreement with
Washington Mutual. Under this agreement, Washington Mutual agreed to purchase
loans originated by FFCA under stated conditions. At this time, the board also
approved employment agreements with FFCA's five executive officers, as required
by Washington Mutual, having terms that matched the term of the Washington
Mutual agreement.

     On January 4, 2000, in order to facilitate FFCA's whole loan sale program,
FFCA organized FFCA Funding Corporation as a non-qualified REIT subsidiary to
originate and sell mortgage loans (FFCA Funding was subsequently converted into
a taxable REIT subsidiary in January, 2001). For tax years beginning after
December 31, 2000, generally not more than 20% of a REIT's total assets can be
represented by securities of one or more taxable REIT subsidiaries. Therefore,
this rule could potentially constrain FFCA's ongoing ability to pursue business
opportunities within its taxable REIT subsidiary.

     On January 28, 2000, at a regularly scheduled meeting, the board of
directors approved a change of FFCA's state of incorporation from Delaware to
Maryland, which was subsequently approved by FFCA's shareholders in May 2000.
The change in the state of incorporation was done primarily to save $150,000
annually on amounts FFCA was paying in Delaware state franchise taxes and to
obtain the favorable benefits of Maryland law that apply to REITs.

     During 2000, FFCA's primary sources of capital used to fund its investment
activity were through whole loan sales to Washington Mutual and loan
securitizations.

     On October 23, 2000, representatives of Goldman Sachs & Co., GE Capital's
financial advisor, contacted representatives of Merrill Lynch to determine
FFCA's interest in renewing discussions with GE Capital regarding a potential
acquisition of FFCA's common stock by GE Capital. In November 2000,
representatives of GE Capital had a telephone call with Mr. Fleischer to renew
the negotiations that had been suspended on October 29, 1999. Following this
call, Mr. Fleischer advised the members of FFCA's board that GE Capital wanted
to resume negotiations and the board agreed that FFCA should resume the
negotiations.

     On December 13, 2000, Mr. Fleischer and Christopher H. Volk, President and
Chief Operating Officer of FFCA, met with representatives of GE Capital in New
York and continued discussions for the

renewal of the parties' negotiations. Following this meeting, Mr. Fleischer
instructed Merrill Lynch to renew negotiations with GE Capital's advisors, as
well as to renew its efforts to solicit indications of interest from other
companies (including parties previously contacted) to determine if any
additional parties would be interested in a transaction with FFCA.

     On January 23, 2001, FFCA received a non-binding indication of interest
from GE Capital to purchase all of FFCA's outstanding common stock for a cash
price of $25 per share. The indication was subject to completion by GE Capital
of its due diligence review of FFCA's operations and other stated conditions,
including receipt of the previously requested private letter ruling from the
Internal Revenue Service, environmental due diligence, resolution of management
employment issues and disposition of any real estate FFCA owned that had
underground storage tanks used for storing gasoline or other properties which
have specified environmental conditions present.

     On January 26, 2001, the board of directors held a regularly scheduled
meeting. At the meeting, representatives of Merrill Lynch delivered a report to
the board regarding the market for publicly traded REITs, the franchise lending
sector of the markets (including competitive factors in the sector), the stock
market outlook for "net lease" REITs, the recent performance of FFCA's common
stock and the terms of the new proposal by GE Capital to acquire all of FFCA's
outstanding common stock for $25 per share. Merrill Lynch also advised the board
of its efforts to solicit indications of interest during December 2000 and
January 2001. Merrill Lynch advised the board that eight financial institutions
were approached regarding a proposed transaction, but only two institutions,
other than GE Capital, signed confidentiality and standstill agreements.
Following their initial due diligence review, neither of these two companies
expressed an interest to continue discussions for a strategic transaction with
FFCA. FFCA was again advised that financial institutions subject to regulation
by federal and state banking authorities continued to have difficulties pursuing
a transaction with FFCA because of regulatory and other issues associated with
FFCA's direct ownership of real estate, size and unique asset mix. The board
authorized management and its advisors to continue to pursue the proposed
transaction with GE Capital, instructing management and its advisors to
substantially remove the conditionality of GE Capital's proposed offer and to
maintain the board's ability to pursue a superior offer if one should arise in
the future.

     On February 9, 2001, FFCA received a revised merger agreement from GE
Capital's counsel reflecting the terms and conditions under which GE Capital was
willing to complete a transaction.

     On February 13, 2001, FFCA and its advisors met with GE Capital and its
advisors in New York to discuss the terms of the proposed transaction. At that
meeting, a number of the conditions to the completion of a transaction
previously required by GE Capital were eliminated (including the condition of a
receipt of a private letter ruling from the Internal Revenue Service, which GE
Capital determined to be unnecessary as a result of a change in the structure of
the transaction), thereby reducing the uncertainty presented in GE Capital's
proposal. Also discussed were proposals to settle other unresolved issues prior
to signing the merger agreement, including management employment issues and the
terms under which FFCA would be required to sell properties with underground
storage tanks prior to completion of the merger.

     From February 14, 2001 through March 27, 2001, negotiations continued
between the parties with respect to the merger agreement, management and
employment issues, due diligence and the sale of the properties with underground
storage tanks. On March 28, 2001, the parties met with advisors in Scottsdale,
Arizona to finalize the terms of the merger agreement, including terms for the
condition related to the sale of the properties with underground storage tanks
or other properties which have specified environmental conditions present and to
discuss terms for FFCA's senior officers' future employment with GE Capital.

     On March 29, 2001, at a special meeting of the board of directors, the
proposed transaction was discussed. At this meeting, representatives of Merrill
Lynch and Bear Stearns were present. Representatives of Merrill Lynch reviewed
the terms of the transaction and the fairness of the $25.00 per share offer. At
that meeting, FFCA's legal advisors also reviewed the terms of the transaction,
including review by FFCA's special Maryland counsel, Ballard Spahr Andrews &
Ingersoll, LLP, of the board's duties under Maryland law. The board was advised
that the terms for the condition related to the sale of the properties having
underground storage tanks and certain other properties which have specified
environmental conditions present were not yet finalized and the board appointed
a signing committee of the board of directors to approve the related provisions
of the merger agreement. Merrill Lynch orally delivered its fairness opinion to
the board, which was subsequently confirmed in writing, that as of March 29,
2001, and subject to the assumptions made, matters considered and limitations on
the review undertaken, the $25.00 per share in cash proposed to be received by
the FFCA shareholders under the merger agreement was fair from a financial point
of view to the shareholders (the full text of the opinion, which sets forth the
assumptions made, the procedures followed, matters considered and limits on the
review undertaken, is attached as Appendix B to this proxy statement, and FFCA
shareholders should carefully read this opinion in its entirety). Subject to
final approval by the signing committee, the board of directors unanimously
approved the transaction and recommended that the FFCA shareholders approve the
merger and the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement.

     On March 29, 2001, the parties completed negotiation of the terms of the
merger agreement, including the terms for the condition related to the sale of
the properties which contain underground storage tanks and three other
properties which have specified environmental conditions present, which were
approved at a meeting of the signing committee later that day.

     On March 30, 2001, the merger agreement was executed and FFCA and GE
Capital issued a press release announcing the signing of the merger agreement.

     On April 10, 2001, FFCA and GE Capital filed the information and materials
required under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act with the Antitrust Division of the
Department of Justice and the Federal Trade Commission. The waiting period under
the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act was terminated on April 13, 2001.

REASONS FOR THE MERGER; FACTORS CONSIDERED

     In making the determination and recommendations described above, the board
of directors considered various factors and alternatives, including the
following:

     *    FFCA's business, current financial condition, results of operations,
          future prospects, the historic trading range of FFCA's common stock
          and the board's belief, on the basis of its familiarity with these
          matters, that the consideration to be received by FFCA's stockholders
          in the merger fairly reflects FFCA's value;
     *    The fact that the merger consideration of $25.00 per share represents:
          -    an 11.2% premium above FFCA's one-month average closing price as
               of March 27, 2001, the date on which Merrill Lynch's fairness
               presentation to the board was based;
          -    a 13.3% premium above FFCA's closing price one month prior to
               March 27, 2001;
          -    a 9.6% premium above FFCA's closing price on March 27, 2001; and
          -    a 5.4% premium above FFCA's closing price as of March 29, 2001,
               the day prior to the public announcement of the merger.
     *    The recent evaluation by the board of FFCA's strategic plans and the
          execution risks related to achieving those plans compared to the risks
          and benefits of the merger including, in particular, the factors
          listed below with regard to FFCA's competitive environment and capital
          raising capabilities:

          -    The competition in FFCA's target market by companies with greater
               financial resources which have a lower cost of capital in
               comparison to FFCA's cost of capital;
          -    FFCA's concern that over the long-term, this limited access to
               capital at competitive rates will limit or alter FFCA's growth
               prospects;
          -    FFCA's limited ability to finance additional investments through
               the issuance of additional corporate debt without issuing common
               stock to maintain required debt-to-equity ratios;
          -    FFCA's current inability to issue common stock at prices which do
               not dilute FFCA's existing shareholders or achieve an acceptable
               rate of return, based on the recent trading ranges for FFCA's
               common stock;
          -    FFCA's reliance on whole loan sales with the following
               considerations:
               *    Washington Mutual is not obligated to, and does not,
                    purchase all loans originated by FFCA;
               *    Washington Mutual only purchased approximately half of the
                    loans FFCA originated during 2000; and
               *    Washington Mutual's recent informal indication that it
                    intends to reduce the concentration limits of loans to any
                    one borrower that it will purchase;
          -    FFCA's reliance on the securitization markets, which FFCA
               believes will be volatile in the future, with the following
               considerations:
               *    the limited investor base for loans of the type originated
                    by FFCA; and
               *    recent loan defaults for sponsors, other than FFCA, of
                    franchise loan securitizations which have led to concern
                    about the quality of loans in these securitizations by the
                    purchasers of the securitization securities;
     *    The fact that FFCA conducted an extensive solicitation process
          involving over 25 parties, the review of confidential information by
          15 parties, the receipt of two indications of interest and only one
          proposal to acquire FFCA;
     *    The board's belief that, based on FFCA's size and unique asset mix and
          the results from its solicitation process, it was unlikely that it
          would receive a third party acquisition proposal (in cash or stock)
          that was financially superior to the consideration to be received
          under the merger agreement;
     *    Possible alternatives to the merger, including continuing to operate
          as an independent public company, selling or spinning off various
          assets and possible alternative restructuring actions;
     *    The fairness opinion of Merrill Lynch dated as of March 29, 2001, to
          the effect that as of that date, the merger consideration of $25.00
          per share to be received by the shareholders was fair to the
          shareholders, from a financial point of view (the full text of the
          written opinion of Merrill Lynch & Co., which sets forth the
          assumptions made, matters considered and limitations on the review
          undertaken in connection with such opinion is attached to this proxy
          statement as Appendix B; FFCA shareholders should read the opinion in
          its entirety);
     *    The terms and conditions of the merger agreement, including terms
          which are designed to enable FFCA's board to be permitted to review
          and evaluate and, under stated circumstances, accept a superior
          proposal, if presented, subject to FFCA's obligation to pay GE Capital
          a $60 million termination fee;
     *    The ability of FFCA to continue to pay its regularly scheduled
          quarterly dividend to its shareholders until completion of the merger,
          including a pro-rated dividend for the period ending immediately
          before the effective time of the merger;
     *    The fact that FFCA's recent growth in income has been largely
          generated by loan sale and loan servicing activities, which income
          does not constitute qualifying income for REITs under the Tax Code;
          over the long term, these income sources will likely become an
          increasing percentage of the overall income base of FFCA; and, as
          such, this has, over the long term, the potential of negatively
          affecting FFCA's REIT status and exposing it to potentially volatile
          income

          performance unless those activities are limited or FFCA increases its
          ownership of real estate assets;
     *    The condition in GE Capital's proposal with respect to the sale of
          properties which either contain underground storage tanks or may have
          specified environmental conditions present and the possibility that
          this condition may not be satisfied;
     *    The board's conclusion that the size of the termination fee, and the
          circumstances when that fee is payable, were reasonable in light of
          the benefits of the merger and the auction process conducted by and on
          behalf of FFCA; and
     *    The other terms and conditions of the merger.

     The board of directors did not assign relative weights to the above factors
or determine that any factor was of more importance than any other factor.
Rather, the board viewed its position and recommendations as being based on the
totality of the information presented to and considered by it.

RECOMMENDATION OF THE BOARD

     The board of directors of FFCA has determined, by unanimous vote, and
declared that the merger, the merger agreement and the related amendment to
FFCA's charter are advisable and in the best interests of FFCA and its
shareholders. Accordingly, FFCA's board of directors has unanimously approved
the merger, the merger agreement and the related amendment to FFCA's charter and
recommends that you approve the merger and the related amendment to FFCA's
charter by voting "FOR" the proposal on the merger.

OPINION OF FFCA'S FINANCIAL ADVISOR

     On March 29, 2001, Merrill Lynch rendered its opinion to FFCA's board of
directors that, as of that date and based upon and subject to the factors and
assumptions contained in its opinion, the $25.00 per share in cash (the "merger
consideration") to be received by the holders of shares of common stock of FFCA
was fair to the shareholders from a financial point of view.

     THE FULL TEXT OF THE MERRILL LYNCH OPINION, WHICH DESCRIBES, AMONG OTHER
THINGS, THE ASSUMPTIONS MADE, MATTERS CONSIDERED AND QUALIFICATIONS AND
LIMITATIONS ON THE REVIEW UNDERTAKEN BY MERRILL LYNCH, IS ATTACHED AS APPENDIX B
TO THIS PROXY STATEMENT AND IS INCORPORATED IN THIS PROXY STATEMENT BY
REFERENCE. YOU SHOULD READ MERRILL LYNCH'S OPINION CAREFULLY AND IN ITS
ENTIRETY. MERRILL LYNCH'S OPINION IS DIRECTED TO THE FFCA BOARD OF DIRECTORS AND
ADDRESSES ONLY THE FAIRNESS, FROM A FINANCIAL POINT OF VIEW, OF THE
CONSIDERATION TO BE PAID BY GE CAPITAL TO THE FFCA SHAREHOLDERS. THE OPINION
DOES NOT ADDRESS ANY OTHER ASPECT OF THE MERGER OR ANY RELATED TRANSACTION, NOR
DOES IT CONSTITUTE A RECOMMENDATION TO ANY SHAREHOLDER AS TO HOW TO VOTE AT THE
FFCA SPECIAL MEETING. THE SUMMARY OF THE FAIRNESS OPINION IN THIS PROXY
STATEMENT, WHILE IT CONTAINS ALL MATERIAL PROVISIONS OF THE OPINION, IS
QUALIFIED IN ITS ENTIRETY BY REFERENCE TO THE FULL TEXT OF THE OPINION.

     The opinion of Merrill Lynch was addressed to the board of directors of
FFCA and evaluated only whether the merger consideration to be received was fair
from a financial point of view to holders of common stock of FFCA. The opinion
of Merrill Lynch did not address any other aspect of the merger. The terms of
the merger, including the merger consideration, were determined through
negotiations between GE Capital and FFCA and were not determined by Merrill
Lynch. Specifically, the opinion of Merrill Lynch did not address the merits of
the underlying decision of FFCA to participate in the merger.

     In arriving at its opinion, Merrill Lynch, among other things:

     *    Reviewed certain publicly available business and financial information
          relating to FFCA that Merrill Lynch deemed to be relevant;
     *    Reviewed certain information, including financial forecasts, relating
          to the business, earnings, cash flow, assets and prospects of FFCA;
     *    Conducted discussions with members of senior management of FFCA
          concerning the matters described in the two bullet points above;
     *    Reviewed the market prices and valuation multiples for FFCA's common
          stock and compared them with those of certain publicly traded
          companies that Merrill Lynch deemed to be relevant;
     *    Reviewed the results of operations of FFCA and compared them with
          those of certain publicly traded companies that Merrill Lynch deemed
          to be relevant;
     *    Compared the proposed financial terms of the merger with the financial
          terms of certain other transactions that Merrill Lynch deemed to be
          relevant;
     *    Participated in certain discussions and negotiations among
          representatives of FFCA and GE Capital and their financial and legal
          advisors;
     *    Reviewed a draft of the merger agreement dated March 29, 2001; and
     *    Reviewed such other financial studies and analyses and took into
          account such other matters as Merrill Lynch deemed necessary,
          including Merrill Lynch's assessment of general economic, market and
          monetary conditions.

     In preparing its opinion, Merrill Lynch has assumed and relied on the
accuracy and completeness of all information supplied or otherwise made
available to it, discussed with or reviewed for or by it, or publicly available,
and Merrill Lynch has not assumed any responsibility for independently verifying
such information or undertaken an independent evaluation or appraisal of any
assets or liabilities of FFCA. Merrill Lynch is not an expert in the evaluation
of allowances for loan and lease losses, and Merrill Lynch has neither made an
independent evaluation of the adequacy of the allowance for loan and lease
losses of FFCA, nor reviewed any individual credit files relating to FFCA, and,
as a result, Merrill Lynch has assumed that the aggregate allowance for loan and
lease losses for FFCA is adequate to cover such losses. In addition, Merrill
Lynch has not assumed any obligation to conduct any physical inspection of the
properties or facilities of FFCA. With respect to the financial forecast
information furnished to or discussed with Merrill Lynch by FFCA, Merrill Lynch
has assumed that they have been reasonably prepared and reflect the best
currently available estimates and judgment of FFCA's management as to the
expected future financial performance of FFCA. In addition, Merrill Lynch has
assumed that, in the course of obtaining the necessary regulatory or other
consents or approvals (contractual or otherwise) for the merger, no
restrictions, including any divestiture requirements or amendments or
modifications, will be imposed that will have a material adverse effect on the
contemplated benefits of the merger. Merrill Lynch has assumed that the merger
agreement would not be materially different from the last draft reviewed by
Merrill Lynch.

     Merrill Lynch's opinion was necessarily based upon market, economic and
other conditions as they existed and could be evaluated, and on the information
made available to Merrill Lynch as of the date of its opinion.

     In performing its analyses, Merrill Lynch made numerous assumptions with
respect to industry performance, general business, economic, market and
financial conditions and other matters, many of which are beyond the control of
Merrill Lynch and FFCA. Any estimates contained in the analyses performed by
Merrill Lynch are not necessarily indicative of actual values or future results,
which may be significantly more or less favorable than suggested by these
analyses. Additionally, estimates of the value of businesses or securities do
not purport to be appraisals or to reflect the prices at which such businesses
or securities might actually be sold. Accordingly, these analyses and estimates
are inherently subject to substantial uncertainty. In addition, the Merrill
Lynch opinion was among several factors taken into

consideration by the FFCA board in making its determination to approve the
merger agreement and the merger. Consequently, the analyses described below
should not be viewed as determinative of the decision of the FFCA board or
management of FFCA with respect to the fairness of the consideration to be paid
to FFCA shareholders.

     The following is a summary of the material financial analyses presented by
Merrill Lynch to the FFCA board on March 29, 2001 in connection with the
rendering of its opinion on that date and is not a complete description of the
analyses underlying the Merrill Lynch opinion or presentation. The preparation
of a fairness opinion is a complex analytic process involving various
determinations as to the most appropriate and relevant methods of financial
analysis and the application of those methods to the particular circumstances.
Therefore, a fairness opinion is not readily susceptible to partial analysis or
summary description. In arriving at its opinion, Merrill Lynch did not attribute
any particular weight to any analysis or factor that it considered, but rather
made qualitative judgments as to the significance and relevance of each analysis
and factor. The financial analyses summarized below include information
presented in tabular format. Accordingly, Merrill Lynch believes that its
analyses and the summary of its analyses must be considered as a whole and that
selecting portions of its analyses and factors or focusing on the information
presented below in tabular format, without considering all analyses and factors
or the full narrative description of the financial analyses, including the
methodologies and assumptions underlying the analyses, could create a misleading
or incomplete view of the process underlying its analyses and opinion. The
financial analyses presented in the tables alone do not constitute a complete
description of the financial analyses.

     MARKET PREMIUM ANALYSIS. Merrill Lynch reviewed the terms of the merger. It
also analyzed the merger consideration as a premium to the trading price of the
FFCA common stock at different intervals prior to the board meeting on March 29,
2001. This analysis indicated that the merger consideration represented a
premium of:

     *    9.6% over the market price of FFCA common stock on March 27, 2001,
          three days immediately before the signing of the merger agreement and
          the date on which Merrill Lynch's fairness presentation to the board
          was based;
     *    13.3% over the market price of the FFCA common stock on February 27,
          2001, one month prior to the board meeting; and
     *    11.2% over the average market price of the FFCA common stock during
          the month immediately prior to the board meeting.

     TRANSACTION VALUE AND TRANSACTION PRICING MULTIPLES. Merrill Lynch compared
the transaction and enterprise values of FFCA based upon the market price of
FFCA on March 27, 2001 of $22.80 and the merger consideration of $25.00. The
transaction value was obtained by multiplying (1) either the market price of
FFCA common stock or the merger consideration, as the case may be, by (2) the
total number of outstanding shares of FFCA common stock on March 27, 2001. The
enterprise value was obtained by adding the respective transaction value to
FFCA's outstanding debt of approximately $724 million. This analysis indicated
that the implied transaction and enterprise value of FFCA based on the merger
consideration were $1.403 billion and $2.127 billion, respectively, and that the
transaction and enterprise value of FFCA based on the closing price of FFCA
common stock on March 27, 2001 were $1.280 billion and $2.004 billion,
respectively.

     Merrill Lynch also analyzed and compared the per share merger consideration
to be received by FFCA shareholders as a multiple of FFCA's (1) fully-diluted
funds from operations per share ("FFO per share") for 2000, (2) FFO per share
for the years 2001 and 2002 as published by First Call and (3) book value per
share as of December 31, 2000 with the corresponding multiples based on the
closing price of FFCA common stock on March 27, 2001. This analysis indicated
that:

                                            Closing Price as of       Merger
    Implied Transaction Multiples              March 27, 2001      Consideration
    -----------------------------              --------------      -------------
2000 Actual First Call FFO per share                 8.0x               8.7x
2001 Estimated First Call FFO per share              7.5x               8.2x
2002 Estimated First Call FFO per share              7.0x               7.6x
Book Value as of December 31, 2000                  1.39x              1.53x

First Call is a recognized data service that monitors and publishes compilations
of earnings and FFO per share estimates by selected research analysts regarding
companies of interest to institutional investors.

     HISTORICAL TRADING ANALYSIS. Merrill Lynch reviewed the historical trading
prices for FFCA common stock. This analysis indicated that:

     *    From January 1, 2000 to March 27, 2001, FFCA's trading price decreased
          5%.
     *    Over the three-year period March 27, 1998 to March 27, 2001, FFCA's
          trading price decreased 18%.
     *    From March 27, 1996 to March 27, 2001, the forward FFO trading
          multiple for FFCA common stock decreased from 10.4x to 7.3x.
     *    From December 31, 1997 to March 27, 2001, FFCA's trading price
          decreased 16% while quarterly FFO per share increased 29%.
     *    From January 1, 2000 to March 27, 2001, approximately 99% of FFCA's
          publicly-traded shares traded below the merger consideration of $25.00
          per share.

     SUMMARY OF VALUATION ANALYSIS. Merrill Lynch compared the merger
consideration to each range of implied valuation shown below, which was derived
from analyses performed by Merrill Lynch, and noted that the merger
consideration to be paid to FFCA shareholders of $25.00 per share was higher
than or in the range of such valuations.

     COMPARABLE COMPANY TRADING ANALYSIS. Using publicly available information,
Merrill Lynch compared selected historical and estimated stock price and
financial ratios for FFCA with corresponding data and ratios of selected
publicly traded companies in the net lease REIT industry. These companies were
selected by Merrill Lynch based upon Merrill Lynch's views as to the
comparability of the financial and operating characteristics of these companies
to FFCA. The companies comparable to FFCA included:

     *    Realty Income Corp.;
     *    Commercial Net Lease Realty, Inc.;
     *    Lexington Corporate Properties Trust;
     *    US Restaurant Properties, Inc.; and
     *    CapTec Net Lease Realty, Inc.

     In order to determine an implied equity reference range based upon an
analysis of comparable companies, Merrill Lynch compared the price of FFCA's
common stock as a multiple of (1) actual 2000

FFO per share, (2) estimated 2001 and 2002 FFO per share based on First Call
reports and (3) December 31, 2000 book value to the corresponding ratios for
each of the comparable companies. This analysis indicated that:

     *    The 2000 Price/FFO per share ratio for the comparable companies ranged
          from 6.5x to 10.4x with an adjusted mean and median of 7.7x, whereas
          FFCA's ratio was 8.0x. The mean and median calculations for the
          comparable company trading analyses were adjusted to exclude Realty
          Income as an outlier.
     *    The 2001 Price/FFO per share ratio for the comparable companies ranged
          from 7.1x to 9.9x with an adjusted mean of 7.6x and an adjusted median
          of 7.7x, whereas FFCA's ratio was 7.5x.
     *    The 2002 Price/FFO per share ratio for the comparable companies ranged
          from 6.7x to 9.5x with an adjusted mean of 7.3x and an adjusted median
          of 7.6x, whereas FFCA's ratio was 7.0x.
     *    The price-to-book value ratio for the comparable companies ranged from
          0.9x to 1.4x with an adjusted mean of 1.0x and an adjusted median of
          0.9x, whereas FFCA's ratio was 1.4x.

     Based on Merrill Lynch's judgment, Merrill Lynch applied various multiple
ranges to the corresponding financial data and estimates of future financial
performance of FFCA to derive an implied equity reference range of $14.26 to
$24.92 per share for FFCA's common stock.

     Because of the inherent differences among the operations of FFCA and the
selected comparable companies, Merrill Lynch believes that a purely quantitative
comparable company analysis would not be dispositive in the context of the
merger. Merrill Lynch further believes that an appropriate use of a comparable
company analysis in this instance involves qualitative judgments concerning
differences among the financial and operating characteristics of FFCA and the
selected comparable companies, which judgments are reflected in the Merrill
Lynch opinion.

     CONTROL PREMIUM ANALYSIS. Merrill Lynch also reviewed the premium paid over
the trading price, as of one month prior to the announcement of the transaction,
for REIT mergers since January 1, 1999 of companies valued at more than $500
million. Excluding the highest and lowest premiums paid, the range of premiums
was 5.7% to 27.3% and the mean and median were 15.7% and 13.2%, respectively.
Applying these premiums to corresponding financial data of FFCA indicated an
implied equity reference range of $23.33 to $28.09 per share for FFCA common
stock.

     COMPARABLE TRANSACTION ANALYSIS. Merrill Lynch also reviewed publicly
available information relating to REIT and commercial finance sector merger and
acquisition transactions since January 1, 1996. Merrill Lynch determined that
none of the reviewed transactions were deemed sufficiently comparable to the
merger, and therefore, were not relevant to this analysis.

     No transaction utilized as a comparison in any of the analysis described is
identical to the merger. An analysis of publicly traded comparable companies and
comparable acquisition transactions is not mathematical; rather it involves
complex considerations and judgments concerning differences in financial and
operating characteristics of the comparable companies involved and other factors
that could affect the public trading value of the comparable companies or the
company to which they are being compared.

     DISCOUNTED CASH FLOW ANALYSIS. Merrill Lynch also performed a discounted
cash flow analysis of the projected dividends of FFCA assuming FFCA continued to
operate as a stand-alone entity. Projections for calendar years 2001 through
2005 were based on management estimates. The projections assumed that common
stock dividends per share would grow at 5.75% annually and that earnings in
excess of those necessary to maintain FFCA's current modified equity-to-assets
ratio at 48.85% could be used to repurchase common shares.

     The terminal value for FFCA was calculated by applying a forward trading
multiple of 7.5x to FFCA's projected 2006 FFO per share, which was based on an
estimated annual asset origination growth rate of between 5% and 15% for the
period 2002 to 2005. The terminal value of FFCA, as well as the projected
dividends of FFCA for the period from 2001 to 2005, were discounted back to
January 1, 2000 using discount rates ranging from 16% to 20%, which Merrill
Lynch viewed as the appropriate range of discount rates for a company with
FFCA's risk characteristics. This analysis resulted in an equity reference range
for FFCA of $20.66 to $24.99 per share.

     NET ASSET VALUATION ANALYSIS. Merrill Lynch also performed a net asset
valuation for the December 31, 2000 balance sheet. FFCA's leases were valued by
applying a capitalization rate ranging from 9% to 10%. The range for
capitalization rates was based on management estimates. The remaining assets and
liabilities were valued using management's estimate of liquidation value.
Property appraisals were not performed for this analysis. The analysis resulted
in an equity reference range for FFCA of $20.00 to $22.96 per share.

     FFCA retained Merrill Lynch based on its experience and expertise. Merrill
Lynch is an internationally recognized investment banking advisory firm. As part
of its investment banking business, Merrill Lynch is regularly engaged in the
valuation of businesses and securities in connection with mergers and
acquisitions, negotiated underwritings, competitive biddings, secondary
distributions of listed and unlisted securities, private placements and
valuations for estate, corporate and other purposes.

     In addition, Merrill Lynch has, in the past, provided financial advisory
and financing services to FFCA and GE Capital and its affiliates, and may
continue to do so and has received, and may receive, fees for the rendering of
such services. In addition, in the ordinary course of its business, Merrill
Lynch may actively trade securities of FFCA and GE Capital and its affiliates
for its own account and for the accounts of customers and, accordingly, may at
any time hold a long or short position in such securities.

     Under a letter agreement between FFCA and Merrill Lynch, dated as of April
6, 1999, FFCA agreed to pay Merrill Lynch for financial advisory services
rendered through the closing of the merger a fee of $300,000 upon execution of
the merger agreement. Merrill Lynch will be entitled to a transaction fee equal
to 0.30% times the total enterprise value of the transaction, or $6,381,000,
upon completion of the merger. Any fees previously paid to Merrill Lynch will be
deducted from any fee to which Merrill Lynch becomes entitled upon completion of
the merger. FFCA has also agreed to reimburse Merrill Lynch for the reasonable
out-of-pocket expenses incurred by it in connection with its engagement
(including reasonable fees and disbursements of its legal counsel) and to
indemnify Merrill Lynch and its affiliates from and against certain liabilities
and expenses, which may include certain liabilities under federal securities
laws, in connection with its engagement.

INTERESTS OF DIRECTORS AND OFFICERS IN THE MERGER

     In considering the recommendation of the FFCA board of directors, FFCA
shareholders should be aware that some of the directors and members of FFCA's
management team may have interests in the merger that are different from, or in
addition to, the interests of FFCA shareholders generally, and that may create
potential conflicts of interest. FFCA's board of directors was aware of these
interests and considered them, among other factors, in approving the merger, the
merger agreement and the related amendment to FFCA's charter. These interests
are summarized below.

     SHARE OWNERSHIP. As of the record date, FFCA's directors and executive
officers and their respective affiliates, who have indicated they intend to vote
"FOR" approval of the merger, directly owned approximately 2.4% of the
outstanding shares of FFCA common stock. In addition, Colony SB, LLC, which
under an investor's agreement with FFCA has the right to nominate one member of
FFCA's

board of directors, has indicated it intends to vote "FOR" approval of the
merger and owned approximately __% of FFCA's outstanding common stock as of the
record date.

     EMPLOYMENT AND SEVERANCE ARRANGEMENTS. FFCA and GE Capital have entered
into letter agreements with FFCA's executive officers, Morton H. Fleischer,
Christopher H. Volk, John Barravecchia, Dennis L. Ruben and Stephen G. Schmitz,
relating to their continued employment with FFCA following the merger, which are
referred to in this proxy statement as the "new employment letters" or, in the
case of Mr. Fleischer, the "consulting agreement." If the merger is completed,
the new employment letters and the consulting agreement will replace the
existing employment agreements, which are referred to in this proxy statement as
the "old employment agreements," that the executive officers have with FFCA and,
effective immediately prior to the completion of the merger, the old employment
agreements will be terminated, except for "gross-up" payment obligations which
will continue after the closing, as described below. As a result of the signing
of the new employment letters and the consulting agreement, FFCA and GE Capital
have waived the provision in the merger agreement that required the termination
of the executive officers before completion of the merger, permitting the
executive officers to continue as officers of FFCA following the merger, except
for Mr. Fleischer, who will be an independent consultant to FFCA with the title
of Chairman Emeritus, as described below.

     Under the old employment agreements, if an executive officer is terminated
without cause or for good reason (both as defined in the old employment
agreements) following or in connection with a change of control of FFCA (which
would include the acquisition of FFCA by GE Capital), the executive would be
entitled to receive, among other things, a lump sum payment in cash equal to
three times the total of (a) the executive's annual base salary on the date of
the change in control, and (b) the highest annual cash bonus payable to the
executive with respect to any of the three years completed immediately before
the date of termination. The old employment agreements also provide that, if an
executive officer is not terminated following or in connection with a change of
control, and if, at any time and for any reason (or no reason), the executive
voluntarily terminates his employment during the thirteenth month following the
change of control, the executive would be entitled to receive a lump sum payment
of two times his base salary and bonus (rather than the three times payment
described above), except for Mr. Fleischer, who in this event would be entitled
to receive a lump sum payment of three times his base salary and bonus. The old
employment agreements further provide that, if these payments (when aggregated
with any other payments they received) become subject to an excise tax imposed
under Section 4999 of the Tax Code (or any similar tax), the executive will be
entitled to receive a "gross-up" payment in respect of these taxes and in
respect of any taxes on such gross-up payment. The old employment agreements
will be terminated immediately before the completion of the merger and replaced
by the new employment letters and, in the case of Mr. Fleischer, the consulting
agreement.

     The following discussion is a summary of the material terms of the new
employment letters for Messrs. Volk, Barravecchia, Ruben and Schmitz. Mr.
Fleischer's new consulting agreement is discussed separately below.

     The new employment letters provide that each executive officer will receive
a base salary and be eligible to receive an incentive bonus and a deferred
bonus. The bonuses are based on FFCA and/or the executive meeting various
performance targets set by GE Capital. The incentive bonus is payable annually
with a target amount of 100% of the executive's base salary if the performance
targets are met, but may range from a minimum of 60% of the executive's base
salary to a maximum of 125% of the executive's base salary, provided the
executive uses his reasonable best efforts to maximize FFCA's performance and
results. The deferred bonus is payable on the second and fourth anniversaries of
the merger, each time with a target amount of 200% of the executive's base
salary if the targets are met. The new employment letters further provide that
the executive officers will receive, at the effective time of the merger, a lump
sum cash payment consisting of a sign-on bonus and a payment for agreeing to the
non-

compete provisions of the new employment letters (and, in the case of Mr. Ruben,
a payment in respect of a covenant not to disparage FFCA). In addition, under
the new employment letters, GE Capital will recommend a grant of options to
acquire 5,000 shares of General Electric Company common stock to each of the
executives, subject to the approval of GE's board of directors and subject to
customary terms and conditions relating to GE stock option grants. If the stock
option grants are not made, the parties have agreed to negotiate for additional
compensation to replace the stock option grants. The cash amounts to be received
for entering into the new employment letters for each executive officer are
shown in the table below.

Executive Vice President -
Marketing

Under the new employment letters, each executive's base salary will be the same
as his current base salary. These salaries currently are (1) $367,500 for Mr.
Volk, (2) $262,500 for Mr. Barravecchia, (3) $288,800 for Mr. Ruben, and (4)
$330,800 for Mr. Schmitz. In addition to the payments in the above table, the
executives will also receive cash payments for their outstanding FFCA options
and restricted stock, as discussed below.

     The employment arrangements under the new employment letters may be
terminated at any time by either the executive or FFCA, with or without cause.
The new employment letters define cause to generally include (1) the executive's
breach of the restrictive covenants in the new employment letter or any other
material breach of the employment letter, any of which results in material harm
to FFCA, (2) the executive committing fraud, embezzlement, theft or a material
dishonest act against FFCA, (3) the executive's conviction of a felony or other
specified crime that results in material harm to FFCA, (4) the executive's
willful failure to perform his duties, or (5) a violation of GE's "Integrity"
policy. If FFCA terminates the employment of the executive without cause at any
time during the 18-month period that begins at the effective time of the merger,
then the executive will be entitled to receive (a) the executive's accrued and
unpaid base salary through the date of termination, (b) the executive's base
salary after the date of termination through the balance of the 18 months after
the effective time of the merger (or any amount then payable under an applicable
severance plan, if higher), and (c) the pro-rata portion of any incentive bonus
that the executive would have been entitled to receive, which payment will be
calculated assuming the applicable performance targets were met.

     Mr. Fleischer, FFCA's Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer,
has entered into a consulting agreement with FFCA, where, after the merger, Mr.
Fleischer will be an independent consultant to FFCA with the title of Chairman
Emeritus. The consulting agreement is for a one-year term

that will automatically renew for one additional year, unless it is terminated
prior to the renewal date by Mr. Fleischer or FFCA. The consulting fee under the
agreement is at a rate of $551,300 annually, which is equal to the current
annual base salary of Mr. Fleischer. Under the agreement, Mr. Fleischer will be
eligible to receive an annual incentive bonus and a deferred bonus. Similar to
the bonuses under the new employment letters described above, the bonuses are
based on FFCA and/or Mr. Fleischer meeting various performance targets set by GE
Capital. The incentive bonus is payable annually with a target amount of 100% of
the annual consulting fee if the performance targets are met, but may range from
a minimum of 60% of the annual consulting fee to a maximum of 125% of the annual
consulting fee, provided Mr. Fleischer uses his reasonable best efforts to
maximize FFCA's performance and results. The deferred bonus is payable on the
first anniversary of the merger, and the second anniversary of the merger if the
consulting agreement is renewed for a one-year term, each time with a target
amount of 100% of the consulting fee if the targets are met.

     In connection with entering into the consulting agreement and in
consideration of his efforts to assist in the completion of the merger, Mr.
Fleischer will receive a lump sum cash payment for a transaction bonus in the
amount of $1,102,000. Mr. Fleischer will also receive a lump sum cash payment of
$1,000,000 for agreeing to the non-compete provisions of the consulting
agreement described below. If Mr. Fleischer's consulting agreement is terminated
without cause (defined similar to "cause" in the new employment letters), he
will be entitled to receive the accrued and unpaid consulting fee through the
end of the consulting term, plus the pro-rated portion of the incentive bonus,
calculated assuming the incentive performance targets were met. In addition to
these payments, Mr. Fleischer will also receive cash payments for his
outstanding FFCA options and restricted stock, as discussed below.

     Under the terms of the new employment letters and the consulting agreement,
if specified payments under the agreements become subject to an excise tax
imposed under Section 4999 of the Tax Code (or any similar tax), the executive
or Mr. Fleischer will be entitled to receive a "gross-up" payment in respect of
these taxes and in respect of any taxes on such gross-up payment. As
consideration for the non-compete payments in the new employment letters and the
consulting agreement described above, under the terms of those agreements, the
executives and Mr. Fleischer have agreed:

     *    not to be engaged in or own a material financial interest in any
          business that is competitive with FFCA during the 18-month period
          following the completion of the merger, or during the consulting term
          in the case of Mr. Fleischer;

     *    not to attempt to hire any FFCA or specified GE Capital employees
          during the 24-month period following the completion of the merger, or,
          if later, the 12-month period following termination of the executive's
          employment or termination of Mr. Fleischer's consulting term, as the
          case may be; and

     *    not to use or disclose any confidential and proprietary information
          applicable to FFCA relating to its business, personnel or policies
          during and after the executive's employment (or Mr. Fleischer's
          consulting term) with FFCA, unless that information was known by the
          executive (or Mr. Fleischer) prior to being employed by FFCA or is
          generally known to the public or the trade.

     FFCA's senior management is currently negotiating the terms of the
continued employment with FFCA of eight senior vice presidents following the
merger, which terms will be similar to the terms of the new employment letters
described above. Although FFCA, GE Capital and the eight senior vice presidents
all desire that these senior vice presidents continue as officers of FFCA
following the merger, the explicit terms of the merger agreement require these
officers to be terminated before completion of the merger. If these eight senior
vice presidents are able to agree to continued employment terms with FFCA
following the merger, GE Capital and FFCA have agreed to waive the provision in
the merger agreement

that requires these officers to be terminated before completion of the merger.
These eight senior vice presidents currently have continuity agreements
(severance agreements) with FFCA. If any of these eight officers are unable to
agree to continued employment terms with FFCA following the merger, that officer
will be terminated before completion of the merger. If any of these officers are
terminated in connection with the merger, the continuity agreements provide that
the officer would be entitled to receive, among other things, a lump sum payment
in cash equal to two times the sum of (a) the officer's annual base salary on
the date of the merger, and (b) the highest annual cash bonus payable to the
officer with respect to any of the three full years immediately before the date
of termination. In addition, the officer would be entitled to receive the unpaid
portion of any bonus awarded to the officer prior to the termination and the
pro-rated portion of the officer's actual bonus from January 1 of the year in
which the termination occurs to the date of termination. The continuity
agreements also provide the officers with a "gross-up" payment and the
continuation of employee benefits and perquisites. If all eight of these senior
vice presidents were terminated on the effective date of the merger, FFCA
estimates that the maximum aggregate cash payment to these officers for base
salary and annual bonus multipliers under the continuity agreements would be
approximately $3,900,000, not including potential "gross-up" payments. These
eight senior vice presidents, regardless of whether they enter into employment
arrangements for continued employment with FFCA following the merger, will also
receive cash payments for their outstanding FFCA options and restricted stock,
as discussed below.

     CHANGE-OF-CONTROL SEVERANCE PLAN. FFCA has a change-of-control severance
plan that covers its key employees, other than those covered by the new
employment letters or the continuity agreements described above. The key
employees covered by the severance plan are FFCA's vice-presidents. Under this
severance plan, the key employee will receive a lump sum cash payment equal to
the sum of (1) the employee's annual base salary on the date of the change of
control (or if higher, the annual base salary in effect immediately before
termination) plus the highest bonus payable to the employee with respect to the
three full years immediately before the date of termination, (2) the unpaid
portion of any bonus awarded prior to the termination, and (3) the pro-rated
portion of the employee's actual bonus from January 1 of the year in which the
termination occurs to the date of termination, if the key employee (a) resigns
with good reason as it is defined in the severance plan, or (b) is terminated by
FFCA, other than terminations for death, for cause as it is defined in the
severance plan or disability, in either of case (a) or (b):

     *    during the two-year period following a change in control of FFCA
          (which would include the acquisition of FFCA by GE Capital in the
          merger); or

     *    after the execution of an agreement which, if consummated, would
          result in a change of control (which would include the merger
          agreement) but before the completion of the change of control, where
          the termination is at the request or suggestion of the acquiror or
          merger partner of FFCA, or otherwise is in connection with the
          anticipated change of control;

The severance plan also provides for the continuation of welfare benefits and
perquisites until the earlier of two years following the date of termination or
the date the employee is covered by a subsequent employer. The severance plan
will remain in place after completion of the merger. The severance plan has
automatic one-year renewals on May 12 of each year, unless written notice of
termination is given to the plan participants at least 120 days before the
annual renewal date. However, if the merger is completed, the severance plan may
not be terminated earlier than two years after the effective date of the merger.

     OPTIONS. As contemplated by the merger agreement and the agreements
governing FFCA's stock options, FFCA's compensation committee will take action
so that all stock options held by FFCA employees, including the officers, will
vest immediately prior to the effective time of the merger. All stock options
held by FFCA's non-employee directors were exercisable on the date of grant, and
will

continue to be exercisable until the effective time of the merger. If the merger
is completed, the merger agreement contemplates that the option holders will, in
exchange for cancellation of their options, receive cash for each stock option
equal to the excess, if any, of the per share merger consideration over the
exercise price per share of each option, less applicable withholding taxes. No
consideration will be paid for options with an exercise price of $25.00 per
share or higher, and such options will be canceled.

     The options held by the directors and executive officers will be converted
into the right to receive cash in the following amounts:

                                                  Cash Payments for Options with

                             ==========                     ==========

As of the record date, the FFCA employees not listed in the table above held
options with exercise prices below $25.00, the per share merger consideration,
to purchase, in the aggregate, approximately 864,000 shares of FFCA common
stock. If the merger is completed, FFCA expects that the aggregate cash payment
to these remaining employees in exchange for cancellation of their outstanding
options will be approximately $2,652,000.

     RESTRICTED STOCK. If the merger is completed, the merger agreement and the
agreements governing FFCA's restricted common stock contemplate that the
compensation committee will take action so that all shares of unvested
restricted stock held by the officers and employees of FFCA will vest
immediately before the merger. In connection with the merger, these restricted
stock holders will receive $25.00 per share in exchange for each share of
restricted stock they hold that vests immediately prior to the merger,
consistent with the treatment of shares of FFCA common stock under the merger
agreement.

     As of the date of this proxy statement, the executive officers of FFCA held
restricted stock and will receive payments in cash for those shares in the
following amounts upon completion of the merger:

                                         ========            ==========

As of the record date, the FFCA employees not listed above held, in the
aggregate, 69,215 shares of restricted stock. If the merger is completed, FFCA
expects that these remaining employees will receive an aggregate cash payment of
approximately $1,730,000 for their restricted stock.

     INDEMNIFICATION OF FFCA OFFICERS AND DIRECTORS. The merger agreement
provides that GE Capital will, or will cause the surviving corporation to,
indemnify each present and former director of FFCA and other persons entitled to
indemnification under the charter and bylaws of FFCA and its subsidiaries to the
fullest extent permitted under applicable law against any costs or expenses,
judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages or liabilities incurred in connection
with any claim, action suit, proceeding or investigation, whether civil,
criminal, administrative or investigative, arising out of or pertaining to
matters existing or occurring before the effective time of the merger. The
merger agreement further provides that GE Capital will cause the surviving
corporation to maintain, for a period of at least six years following the
merger, FFCA's directors' and officers' liability insurance policies covering
the persons serving as the officers and directors of FFCA and its subsidiaries
immediately prior to the merger.

AMENDMENT TO FFCA'S CHARTER

     Under the merger agreement, FFCA's charter will be amended and restated at
the effective time of the merger in the form of the new charter attached as
Appendix C to this proxy statement. FFCA's amended and restated charter will,
among other things, remove the charter's current restriction on the ownership of
FFCA common stock, which currently prevents any one individual or entity from
owning more than 9.8% of FFCA's outstanding common stock. This restriction is in
FFCA's charter so that FFCA will continue to satisfy the REIT requirements of
the Tax Code. Because GE Capital will own 100% of FFCA's common stock after the
merger is completed, FFCA's charter must be amended to delete this restriction
before completion of the merger. Since the merger agreement requires FFCA's new
charter to be effective at the same time as the merger is completed, Maryland
law requires that, as part of FFCA shareholder approval of the merger, the
shareholders approve the related amendment to FFCA's charter.

     You do not need to indicate a separate vote to approve the amendment to
FFCA's charter. By voting "FOR" approval of the merger you will also be voting
in favor of the related amendment to the FFCA charter. If the merger agreement
is terminated before completion of the merger, or the merger is not otherwise
completed, the related amendment to FFCA's charter will not be made and the
ownership restriction described above will remain in place.

EFFECTS OF THE MERGER

     Following completion of the merger, FFCA will become a wholly-owned
subsidiary of GE Capital. FFCA shareholders will receive cash in exchange for
their shares of FFCA common stock and will no longer have any interest in the
future earnings or growth of FFCA. After the merger, FFCA will no longer be a
public company and its shares will no longer be listed or traded on the NYSE.

     FFCA's regular quarterly dividends will be paid until the merger is
completed. In addition, a special pro-rated dividend will be paid for the
partial quarterly period, if any, ending on the day prior to the merger. Once
the merger is completed, FFCA shareholders will no longer receive any dividends
for any period following the effective time of the merger.

FINANCING FOR THE MERGER

     GE Capital intends to fund the merger consideration internally with cash
generated from GE Capital's operations. There are no financing contingencies to
the completion of the merger.

EXPECTED ACCOUNTING TREATMENT OF THE MERGER

     The merger will be accounted for using the purchase method of accounting
for financial reporting purposes under accounting principles generally accepted
in the United States. Under this method of accounting, the aggregate
consideration paid by GE Capital in connection with the merger will be allocated
to FFCA's assets and liabilities based on their fair values, with any excess or
deficit being treated as goodwill. The assets and liabilities and results of
operations of FFCA will be consolidated into the assets and liabilities and
results of operations of GE Capital from the date of the merger.

HART-SCOTT-RODINO FILING

     Under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act, and the rules promulgated under that act,
the merger may not be completed until Notification and Report Forms under the
Act have been filed with the Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice and
the Federal Trade Commission and either a 30-day waiting period requirement has
been satisfied or the 30-day waiting period is terminated early. On April 10,
2001, GE Capital and FFCA each filed a Notification and Report Form under the
Act with the Antitrust Division and the FTC. The 30-day waiting period was
terminated early on April 13, 2001. At any time before or after the merger, the
FTC, the Antitrust Division or others could take action under the antitrust laws
with respect to the merger, including seeking to enjoin the completion of the
merger, to rescind the merger or to require either GE Capital or FFCA to divest
substantial assets. Neither FFCA nor GE Capital believes the merger will violate
the antitrust laws or will be enjoined; however, there can be no assurance that
a challenge to the merger on antitrust grounds will not be made, or, if a
challenge is made, that it would not be successful.

MATERIAL FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSIDERATIONS

     Upon completion of the merger, each outstanding share of FFCA common stock
will be converted into the right to receive $25.00 in cash, without interest,
subject to reduction for applicable withholding taxes. The following discussion
is a summary of the material federal income tax consequences of the merger to
the shareholders of FFCA whose shares of common stock are surrendered in
connection with the merger. The discussion below does not purport to deal with
all aspects of federal income taxation that may affect particular shareholders
in light of their individual circumstances, and is not intended for shareholders
subject to special treatment under the federal income tax law, including
insurance companies, tax exempt organizations, financial institutions,
broker-dealers, foreign persons, shareholders who hold their stock as part of a
hedge, integrated transaction, appreciated financial position, straddle or
conversion transaction, traders who elect to use the mark-to-market method to
account for their securities, shareholders who do not hold their stock as
capital assets and shareholders who have acquired their stock upon the exercise
of employee options or otherwise as compensation. In addition, the discussion
below does not consider the effect of any applicable state, local or foreign tax
laws. The discussion below is based upon current provisions of the Tax Code,
currently applicable treasury regulations promulgated under the Tax Code, and
judicial and administrative decisions and rulings. Future legislative changes,
judicial administrative changes or interpretations could alter or modify the
statements and conditions described in this proxy statement, and these changes
or interpretations could be retroactive and could affect the tax consequences to
the shareholders of FFCA.

     THIS DISCUSSION DOES NOT ADDRESS ALL ASPECTS OF FEDERAL INCOME TAXATION
THAT MAY BE IMPORTANT TO A SHAREHOLDER BASED ON SUCH HOLDER'S PARTICULAR
CIRCUMSTANCES AND DOES NOT ADDRESS ANY ASPECT OF STATE, LOCAL OR FOREIGN TAX
LAWS. BECAUSE INDIVIDUAL CIRCUMSTANCES MAY DIFFER, EACH SHAREHOLDER IS URGED TO
CONSULT THEIR OWN TAX ADVISOR TO DETERMINE THE APPLICABILITY OF THE RULES
DISCUSSED BELOW TO THE SHAREHOLDER AND THE PARTICULAR TAX EFFECTS OF THE MERGER,
INCLUDING THE APPLICATION AND EFFECT OF STATE, LOCAL AND OTHER TAX LAWS. FOREIGN
SHAREHOLDERS SHOULD CONSULT WITH LOCAL ADVISORS AS TO THE TAX CONSEQUENCES OF
THE MERGER.

     The right to receive cash pursuant to the merger will be a taxable
transaction at the effective time of the merger for federal income tax purposes
under the Tax Code. In general, for federal income tax purposes, a shareholder
will recognize gain or loss equal to the difference between the cash received by
the shareholder under the merger agreement and the shareholder's adjusted tax
basis in the shares of common stock surrendered in connection with the merger
agreement. This gain or loss will be a capital gain or loss. The applicable tax
rate for this gain, if any, for non-corporate shareholders (including
individuals, estates and trusts) will, as a general matter, depend upon each
shareholder's holding period for the shares of common stock at the effective
time of the merger. If a non-corporate shareholder's holding period for the
shares of common stock is more than one year, the shareholder will be subject to
federal income tax at a maximum rate of 20%. If the shareholder's holding period
for the shares of common stock is one year or less, the gain will be taxed at
the same rate as ordinary income. Capital loss recognized by non-corporate
shareholders generally is deductible only to the extent of capital gain plus
ordinary income of up to $3,000. Net capital loss in excess of $3,000 may be
carried forward to subsequent taxable years.

     For corporations, capital losses are allowed only to the extent of capital
gains, and net capital gain is taxed at the same rate as ordinary income.
Corporations generally may carry capital losses back up to three years and
forward up to five years.

     Payment in connection with the merger may be subject to "backup
withholding" at a 31% rate. Backup withholding generally applies if the
shareholder fails to furnish the shareholder's social security number or other
taxpayer identification number ("TIN"), or furnishes an incorrect TIN. Backup
withholding is not an additional tax but merely a creditable advance payment
which may be refunded to the extent it results in an overpayment of tax,
provided that specific required information is furnished to the Internal Revenue
Service. Various persons generally are exempt from backup withholding, including
corporations and financial institutions. Penalties apply for failure to furnish
correct information and for failure to include reportable payments in income.
Shareholders should consult with their own tax advisors as to the qualifications
and procedures for exemption from backup withholding.

                              THE MERGER AGREEMENT

     The following is a summary of the material provisions of the merger
agreement, a copy of which is attached as Appendix A to this proxy statement and
is incorporated in this document by reference. This summary does not contain all
the information you should consider and is qualified in its entirety by
reference to the merger agreement. We urge all FFCA shareholders to read the
merger agreement in its entirety for a more complete description of the terms
and conditions of the merger.

THE MERGER STRUCTURE

     THE MERGER. The merger agreement provides that Galahad Acquisition Corp.
("Merger Sub"), an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of GE Capital, will be
merged with and into FFCA. At the time of the merger, the separate corporate
existence of Merger Sub will cease and FFCA will continue as the surviving
corporation and be a wholly-owned subsidiary of GE Capital.

     FFCA'S CHARTER AND BYLAWS. Under the merger agreement, FFCA's charter will
be amended and restated at the effective time of the merger in the form attached
as Appendix C to this proxy statement. As described above under "THE MERGER -
Amendment to FFCA's Charter," the amended and restated charter will, among other
things, remove the share ownership restrictions currently contained in FFCA's
charter. These restrictions must be removed so that the merger can be completed.
At the effective time of the merger, the surviving corporation will also adopt
new bylaws.

     OFFICERS AND DIRECTORS. None of the FFCA directors will be directors of the
surviving corporation after the merger. Mr. Fleischer, Chairman of the Board and
Chief Executive Officer of FFCA, will become an independent contractor of FFCA
with the title of Chairman Emeritus. The current executive officers of FFCA will
continue as executive officers of FFCA following the merger under the terms of
their new employment letters discussed above under the heading "THE MERGER -
Interests of Directors and Officers in the Merger." Also as discussed above, the
remaining senior officers of FFCA are in active discussions regarding the terms
of their continued employment with FFCA following the merger. The merger
agreement provides that each of the remaining senior officers of FFCA will be
terminated at the effective time of the merger. FFCA and GE Capital have agreed
to waive this provision if the current discussions with these officers result in
mutually agreeable terms for the continued employment of the senior officers by
FFCA following completion of the merger.

EFFECTIVE TIME

     The merger will become effective when the articles of merger have been
filed with and accepted by the State Department of Assessments and Taxation of
the State of Maryland in accordance with the Maryland General Corporation Law,
or at a subsequent time as GE Capital and FFCA shall agree and specify in the
articles of merger. At that time, Merger Sub will be merged with and into FFCA
and will cease to exist as a separate entity, and FFCA will become a subsidiary
of GE Capital. FFCA expects the merger to become effective as soon as
practicable after approval of the merger by the FFCA shareholders and the
satisfaction or waiver of all other conditions to the merger. The merger must be
completed on or before December 31, 2001, unless that date is extended by the
parties.

CONVERSION OF FFCA COMMON STOCK

     At the effective time of the merger, each issued and outstanding share of
FFCA common stock will be converted into the right to receive $25.00 in cash,
without interest, subject to reduction for applicable withholding taxes, if any.
Under Maryland law, since FFCA's shares are listed on the NYSE, FFCA
shareholders do not have the right to dissent and receive the appraised value of
their shares in connection with the proposed merger. There are no dissenters' or
appraisal rights provided under the merger agreement or otherwise offered in the
merger.

PROCEDURES FOR EXCHANGE OF STOCK CERTIFICATES

     Prior to the effective time of the merger, Merger Sub will appoint a bank
or trust company acceptable to FFCA to act as exchange agent. At or prior to the
effective time, GE Capital will deposit with the exchange agent, in trust for
the benefit of the holders of the common stock of FFCA, all the cash to be paid
in exchange for the outstanding shares of FFCA common stock. Within five days
after the effective time of the merger, the exchange agent will send to each
record holder of outstanding stock a letter of transmittal. The letter of
transmittal will specify that delivery will be effected and risk of loss and
title to the stock certificates will pass only upon delivery of the stock
certificate to the exchange agent. In addition, the exchange agent will also
mail to each record holder instructions on how to properly surrender their stock
certificates for payment.

     At and following the effective time of the merger, the holders of FFCA
stock certificates will cease to have any rights with respect to their shares of
FFCA common stock, except as otherwise provided by law. On or after the
effective time of the merger, any certificates presented to the exchange agent,
FFCA or GE Capital for any reason will be cancelled and exchanged for the merger
consideration.

     No interest will be paid or accrued on the cash payable upon the surrender
of your stock certificate. In the event of a transfer of ownership of FFCA
common stock which is not registered in the transfer records of FFCA, a check in
the proper amount of cash may be issued with respect to such stock to the
transferee if the certificate is presented to the exchange agent, accompanied by
all documents required to evidence and effect the transfer and to evidence that
any applicable stock transfer taxes have been paid.

     After the effective time of the merger, there will be no transfers of
certificates that previously represented shares of common stock on the stock
books of FFCA.

     HOLDERS OF FFCA COMMON STOCK SHOULD NOT SEND IN THEIR FFCA COMMON STOCK
CERTIFICATES TO THE EXCHANGE AGENT UNTIL THEY RECEIVE A LETTER OF TRANSMITTAL
FROM THE EXCHANGE AGENT.

TREATMENT OF STOCK OPTIONS, RESTRICTED STOCK AND WARRANTS

     The merger agreement provides that immediately prior to the effective time
of the merger, each outstanding option to purchase FFCA common stock under
FFCA's stock option plan and each share of restricted stock, whether or not then
vested or exercisable, will be accelerated by FFCA's compensation committee and
be considered vested or exercisable, as contemplated by the option and
restricted stock agreements. Immediately after the merger, the stock options
will be cancelled and each share of restricted shares will be converted into the
right to receive the merger consideration. Each holder of a cancelled option
will receive an amount in cash equal to the number of shares of FFCA common
stock previously subject to the option multiplied by the excess, if any, of
$25.00 per share over the exercise price per share of FFCA common stock
previously subject to such option, less any applicable withholding taxes. All
outstanding shares of FFCA's restricted stock will become free of any
restrictions and will be converted into the right to receive the merger
consideration as described above. At the effective time of the merger, each
outstanding warrant of FFCA will become exercisable for the exercise price
contained in the warrant. Since the exercise price of all of FFCA's warrants is
greater than $25.00, all of the warrants will be cancelled and no consideration
will be issued to any warrant holder.

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES

     BY FFCA. In the merger agreement, FFCA made customary representations and
warranties, subject, in most cases, to materiality qualifications and specific
exceptions which were disclosed to GE Capital and Merger Sub, concerning the

          event, distribution date or stock acquisition date occurred under the
          shareholders' rights agreement;

     *    the consent of Merger Sub's shareholder to the merger, and that such

     *    the absence of undisclosed broker fees;

     *    the funds to pay all consideration due under the merger agreement; and

CONDUCT OF FFCA'S BUSINESS BEFORE THE MERGER

     FFCA has agreed that, prior to the merger, FFCA and its subsidiaries will
(except as contemplated or permitted by the merger agreement, including as
otherwise disclosed to GE Capital, as required by law or rules and regulations
of a governmental entity or the NYSE, or to the extent GE Capital consents in
writing, which consent may not be unreasonably withheld):

     *    conduct their respective businesses in the usual, regular and ordinary
          course in all material respects, in substantially the same manner as
          conducted until now;

     *    use reasonable efforts to preserve intact their present lines of

     *    not enter any new material line of business;

     *    take all action necessary to preserve the status of FFCA as a REIT
          within the meaning of the Tax Code (except that any effect on FFCA's
          status as a REIT caused by a failure to pay a dividend in excess of
          the amounts permitted by the merger agreement will not be considered a
          default of this provision);

     *    not pay dividends on or make distributions with respect to FFCA common
          stock, other than regular quarterly dividends in an amount not to
          exceed $0.56 per share of common stock for each dividend (including a
          pro-rated dividend for the portion of the quarterly dividend period
          ending the day prior to the effective time of the merger);

     *    not split, combine or reclassify any capital stock, nor issue,

          subsidiary of FFCA which remains a wholly owned subsidiary of FFCA
          after that transaction;

     *    not repurchase, redeem or otherwise acquire any shares of their
          respective capital stock or any securities convertible into or

          than under previously existing contractual agreements or in the
          ordinary course of business consistent with past practice;

     *    not amend their respective organizational and governing documents,
          other than amendment to the charter of FFCA described in this proxy

          other business combination with any other entity, except for internal
          reorganizations and consolidations involving existing subsidiaries of
          FFCA or the creation of new subsidiaries of FFCA organized to conduct
          or continue activities permitted by the merger agreement;

     *    not sell, lease, encumber or otherwise dispose of any asset, other
          than in the ordinary course of business, internal reorganizations or
          consolidations involving existing subsidiaries of FFCA, sales of
          loans, or pursuant to the merger agreement;

     *    not acquire or operate any real property on which an underground

          located;

     *    not make any loans, advances, capital contributions, or investments,
          other than in the ordinary course of business or by FFCA or its
          subsidiaries to FFCA or its subsidiaries;

     *    not create, incur, or assume indebtedness, other than under FFCA's
          existing lines of credit or in the ordinary course of business;

     *    not materially change FFCA's method of accounting, except as required
          by generally accepted accounting principals, or make or revoke any
          material tax elections;

     *    not enter into or adopt any employment, change in control, severance
          or other similar plan or agreement with respect to any employee of
          FFCA or its subsidiaries, nor increase the compensation of directors,
          officers or employees of FFCA or its subsidiaries except in the
          ordinary course of business consistent with past practice;

     *    not enter into, adopt, amend or terminate any employee benefit
          arrangement, except in the ordinary course of business consistent with
          past practice or pursuant to the merger agreement;

     *    not pay any bonuses or incentive awards in excess of a certain dollar
          amount, other than pursuant to the merger agreement;

     *    not enter into an agreement to take any of the actions described above

ADDITIONAL AGREEMENTS

     PROXY STATEMENT. FFCA has agreed to prepare and file this proxy statement
with the Securities and Exchange Commission in connection with the solicitation
of proxies for the special meeting.

     SHAREHOLDERS' MEETING. Under the merger agreement, FFCA has agreed to
convene a special meeting of the FFCA shareholders to consider and vote upon the
approval of the merger and the related amendment to FFCA's charter. In
connection with this meeting, FFCA will take all lawful action to solicit the
approval of the proposal.

     DISPOSITION OF PROPERTIES CONTAINING UNDERGROUND STORAGE TANKS AND
SPECIFIED ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITIONS. GE Capital has required that, as a condition
to the merger, FFCA must sell any real estate owned by FFCA which has, or has
had, either an underground storage tank for the storage of gasoline or which may
have specified environmental conditions present. As of the date of this proxy
statement, FFCA owns 178 properties with underground storage tanks and GE
Capital has identified three additional properties owned by FFCA which may have
specified environmental conditions present. These

properties are generally convenience stores that sell gasoline, or properties
where gasoline was sold in the past. These properties must be sold prior to the
completion of the merger. The aggregate of the net sales prices for these
properties must be at least as high as the price determined by the valuation
formula separately agreed to by the parties. The actual sales prices of these
properties will not change the $25.00 per share merger consideration that FFCA
shareholders will receive if the merger is completed.

     REASONABLE BEST EFFORTS TO BE TAKEN. GE Capital and FFCA have agreed to use
their reasonable best efforts to take all actions and do all things necessary,
proper or advisable under the merger agreement and applicable laws to complete
the merger as soon as possible after March 30, 2001, the date of the merger
agreement. Accordingly, GE Capital and FFCA have agreed to, as soon as
practicable, obtain all permits, consents, approvals and authorizations
necessary or advisable in order to complete the merger. The parties have also
agreed to make the appropriate filings under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act and take
any necessary action under that act, except neither GE Capital or FFCA is
required to sell, hold separate or otherwise dispose of or conduct their
respective businesses in a manner that would reasonably be expected to have a
material adverse effect on FFCA's business or on GE Capital's "business asset
funding" business. On April 10, 2001, FFCA and GE Capital filed the information
and materials required under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act and the waiting period
was terminated early on April 13, 2001.

     NO SOLICITATION OF TRANSACTIONS. The merger agreement provides that FFCA
will not itself, and will not permit any of its subsidiaries or any of their
representatives, directly or indirectly to, initiate, solicit or knowingly
encourage the submission of any proposal for a business combination transaction
(except as contemplated in the merger agreement), including:

     *    any merger, consolidation, share exchange, business combination, or
          other similar transaction;

     *    any sale, lease, exchange or other disposition (other than a pledge or
          mortgage) of 20% or more of the assets of FFCA; and

     *    the acquisition by a person or entity of beneficial ownership of 20%
          or more of the shares of FFCA, whether by tender offer, exchange offer
          or otherwise.

The above business combination transactions are referred to in the merger
agreement and this proxy statement as an "acquisition proposal."

     In addition, FFCA and its subsidiaries may not participate in discussions
with or furnish any information to any person who is attempting to make, or
otherwise negotiate or accept, a proposal for a business combination
transaction. However, FFCA's board may, in response to a bona fide unsolicited
written proposal for a business combination transaction:

     *    furnish information to, request information from and engage in
          negotiations with the persons making the proposal if FFCA's board
          determines in good faith that the proposal could reasonably be
          expected to constitute or result in a superior proposal (as defined in
          the merger agreement);

     *    recommend such proposal or withdraw or modify in any adverse manner
          its approval or recommendation of the merger if FFCA's board
          determines in good faith that the proposal is a superior proposal; and

     *    in either case, prior to taking the above action, FFCA must provide
          notice to GE Capital as required under the merger agreement and
          receive from the person offering the bona fide unsolicited written
          proposal for a business combination transaction a confidentiality and
          standstill agreement on terms no less favorable to FFCA than its
          confidentiality agreement with GE Capital.

The merger agreement defines a "superior proposal" as a bona fide written
acquisition proposal made by a third party which FFCA's board determines in good
faith (1) would, if completed, result in a transaction that represents greater
value to the FFCA shareholders, from a financial point of view, than the merger
consideration, and (2) is reasonably capable of being completed.

     As permitted by the merger agreement and in connection with their duties
under Maryland law, FFCA's board of directors may evaluate and accept a superior
proposal, whether received before or after FFCA shareholder approval of the
merger is obtained. FFCA has agreed to keep GE Capital informed of the status of
any negotiations relating to another proposal.

     INDEMNIFICATION OF FFCA OFFICERS AND DIRECTORS. The merger agreement
provides that GE Capital will, or will cause the surviving corporation to,
indemnify each present and former director of FFCA and other persons entitled to
indemnification under the charter and bylaws of FFCA and its subsidiaries to the
fullest extent permitted under applicable law against any costs or expenses,
judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages or liabilities incurred in connection
with any claim, action suit, proceeding or investigation, whether civil,
criminal, administrative or investigative, arising out of or pertaining to
matters existing or occurring before the effective time of the merger. The
merger agreement further provides that GE Capital will cause the surviving
corporation to maintain, for a period of at least six years following the
merger, FFCA's directors' and officers' liability insurance policies covering
the persons serving as the officers and directors of FFCA and its subsidiaries
immediately prior to the merger.

     SALE OF SECURITIZATION INTERESTS. FFCA has agreed to sell to an affiliate
of GE Capital, immediately before the merger, FFCA's securitization assets, not
including servicing rights held by FFCA. This sale will not delay completion of
the merger and will not affect the $25.00 per share merger consideration to be
received by FFCA shareholders in the merger.

     ACCESS TO INFORMATION. FFCA has agreed to give GE Capital reasonable
access, prior to completion of the merger, to FFCA's business, properties and
personnel as GE Capital may reasonably request.

CONDITIONS TO THE MERGER

     The parties' respective obligations to complete the merger are subject to
satisfaction or waiver of the following conditions:

     *    the merger, including the related amendment of FFCA's charter, is
          approved by the shareholders of FFCA;

     *    no governmental authority has enacted, promulgated, enforced or
          entered any order or statute, rule or regulation which is in effect
          and which has the effect of making the merger illegal or otherwise
          prohibiting completion of the merger; and

     *    any waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act has terminated or
          expired, which waiting period was terminated on April 13, 2001.

          FFCA at or before the effective time, and each of the representations
          and warranties of FFCA in the merger agreement will be true and
          correct in all material aspects (provided

          that this condition will be deemed to be satisfied if all failures of
          the representations and warranties taken together would not reasonably
          be expected to have a material adverse effect on FFCA and its
          subsidiaries taken as a whole);

     *    since March 30, 2001, no change or event has occurred that would
          reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on FFCA and
          its subsidiaries taken as a whole;

     *    GE Capital has received an opinion from Kutak Rock LLP or other
          counsel to FFCA reasonably acceptable to GE Capital as to the status
          of FFCA as a REIT for federal income tax purposes and the tax status
          of specified subsidiaries, and substantially in the form attached as
          an exhibit to the merger agreement or as otherwise agreed to by the
          parties;

     *    no governmental suit is pending or threatened which would either have
          the effect of making the merger illegal, place any material
          limitations on GE Capital's or Merger Sub's ownership or operation of
          all or a material portion of FFCA's business, or otherwise compel GE
          Capital or its affiliates to dispose of or hold separate (1) a
          material portion of the business or assets of GE Capital's business
          unit that specializes in providing financing for franchise operations,
          or (2) any portion of the business or assets of FFCA, if it would
          reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on FFCA's
          business;

     *    since March 30, 2001, no adverse changes in tax laws has occurred and
          is continuing that would reasonably be expected to result in a
          material risk that FFCA would not qualify as a REIT at or before the
          effective time;

     *    since March 30, 2001 through the effective time, there must not be a
          25% decline in the NYSE composite index or a general suspension of
          trading on the NYSE, in each case, that is continuing as of the
          effective time; and

     *    FFCA has disposed of all real estate FFCA owns which contain
          underground storage tanks and the three additional properties which
          have specified environmental conditions present, as required by the
          merger agreement.

     The obligation of FFCA to complete the merger is subject to the
satisfaction or waiver of the following condition:

     *    GE Capital and Merger Sub will have performed in all material respects
          each of their respective obligations under the merger agreement that
          are required to be performed at or before the effective time of the
          merger, and each of the representations and warranties of GE Capital
          and Merger Sub in the merger agreement will be true and correct in all
          material aspects.

TERMINATION OF THE MERGER AGREEMENT

     The merger agreement may be terminated at any time prior to the completion
of the merger, whether before or after approval by FFCA's shareholders has been
obtained:

     *    by mutual written consent of FFCA and GE Capital;

     *    by either GE Capital or FFCA if the merger is not approved by FFCA's
          shareholders at the special meeting or any adjournment or postponement
          of the meeting;

     *    by either GE Capital or FFCA if the merger is not completed on or
          before December 31, 2001;

     *    by either GE Capital or FFCA if any final, nonappealable order of any
          governmental entity or court is in effect that prevents completion of
          the merger;

     *    by FFCA if any of the conditions to FFCA's duty to complete the merger
          become impossible to fulfill and are not waived in accordance with the
          terms of the merger agreement;

     *    by FFCA, after giving two days' advance notice to GE Capital, if FFCA
          accepts a proposal for a business combination which FFCA deems to be a
          superior proposal (as defined in the merger agreement) to the merger
          after giving effect to any modification GE Capital makes to its offer
          during the two day period, provided that the conditions and
          requirements of the merger agreement have been satisfied;

     *    by GE Capital if any of the conditions to GE Capital's duty to
          complete the merger become impossible to fulfill and are not waived in
          accordance with the terms of the merger agreement; or

     *    by GE Capital if the board of directors of FFCA withdraws or modifies
          in any adverse manner its approval or recommendation of the merger
          agreement or approves or recommends a superior proposal.

TERMINATION FEE

     FFCA must pay GE Capital a $60 million termination fee if the merger
agreement is terminated:

     *    by GE Capital, as a result of FFCA's board of directors withdrawing or
          modifying in any adverse manner its approval or recommendation of the
          merger agreement or approving or recommending to FFCA's shareholders a
          superior proposal;

     *    by FFCA, as a result of FFCA's board determining to approve or
          recommend a superior proposal to the merger; or

     *    by either FFCA or GE Capital as a result of (1) the FFCA shareholders
          not approving the merger at the special meeting, (2) at the time of
          such meeting, an acquisition proposal, in which the consideration
          offered to FFCA shareholders has a value in excess of $25.00 per
          share, has been publicly announced and has not been publicly rejected
          by the board, and (3) within 12 months after termination of the merger
          agreement, FFCA either (a) completes the transaction with respect to
          such acquisition proposal, or (b) enters into a definitive agreement
          to complete such transaction (or any other transaction which likewise
          offers FFCA shareholders per share value in excess of $25.00) and any
          such transaction is completed at any time after entering into that
          agreement.

AMENDMENTS, EXTENSIONS AND WAIVERS

     The merger agreement may be amended by action taken by the respective
boards of directors of FFCA, GE Capital and Merger Sub at any time before or
after approval of the merger by the shareholders of FFCA or Merger Sub; but
after any such approval by the shareholders of FFCA or Merger Sub, no amendment
may be made that would require additional FFCA or Merger Sub shareholder
approval without obtaining such additional shareholder approval.

     AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER, dated as of March 30, 2001 (this
"AGREEMENT"), among General Electric Capital Corporation, a New York corporation
("PARENT"), Galahad Acquisition Corp., a Maryland corporation ("MERGER SUB") and
a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent, and Franchise Finance Corporation of
America, a Maryland corporation (the "COMPANY").

                                   WITNESSETH:

     WHEREAS, the respective Boards of Directors of Parent, Merger Sub and the
Company have each determined that the merger of the Company with Merger Sub (the
"MERGER"), upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this
Agreement, is advisable and in the best interests of their respective
stockholders, and such Boards of Directors have approved such Merger pursuant to
which each outstanding share of common stock, par value $.01 per share, of the
Company (the "COMPANY COMMON STOCK") issued and outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time (as defined in SECTION 1.3), other than shares owned or held
directly or indirectly by Parent or directly by the Company, will be converted

forth on Section 1.7 of the Company Disclosure Schedule, the officers of the
Company immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the officers of the
Surviving Corporation, until their respective successors are duly elected and
qualified or their earlier resignation or removal or otherwise ceasing to be an

     1.8 EFFECT ON CAPITAL STOCK. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger
and without any action on the part of the Company, Merger Sub or any holder of
any capital stock thereof:

          (a) (i) Each share of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding
     immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than Cancelled Shares (as
     defined in SECTION 1.8(A)(II)), shall be converted into the right to
     receive $25.00 per share in cash, without interest thereon.

          (ii) Each share of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding
     immediately prior to the Effective Time and owned or held by Parent or any
     of its Subsidiaries and each share of Company Common Stock held in treasury
     of the Company at the Effective Time ("CANCELLED SHARES") shall, by virtue
     of the Merger, cease to be outstanding and shall be cancelled and no Merger
     Consideration or other consideration shall be delivered in exchange
     therefor. For purposes of this SECTION 1.8(A)(II), shares of Company Common
     Stock owned beneficially or held of record by any plan, program or
     arrangement sponsored or maintained for the benefit of any current or
     former employee of the Company, Parent or any of their respective
     Subsidiaries will not be deemed to be held by the Company, Parent or any
     such Subsidiary, regardless of whether the Company, Parent or any such
     Subsidiary has the power, directly or indirectly, to vote or control the
     disposition of such shares.

          (iii) Each share of capital stock of Merger Sub issued and outstanding
     immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into the right
     to receive one validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of common
     stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Surviving Corporation.

                                       A-3

          (b) As a result of the Merger and without any action on the part of
     the holders thereof, at the Effective Time, all shares of Company Common
     Stock outstanding immediately prior to such time shall cease to be
     outstanding and shall be cancelled and shall cease to exist, and each
     holder of a certificate which immediately prior to the Effective Time
     represented any such shares of Company Common Stock (a "Certificate") shall
     thereafter cease to have any rights with respect to such shares of Company
     Common Stock, except the right to receive the consideration specified in
     SECTION 1.8(A)(I) (the "MERGER CONSIDERATION") in accordance with ARTICLE
     II upon the surrender of such Certificate (other than in the case of
     Cancelled Shares); PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that the foregoing shall not affect
     the payment of dividends with a record date prior to the Effective Time to
     the holders of record on such record date.

     1.9 TREATMENT OF OPTIONS AND RESTRICTED STOCK.

          (a) Immediately prior to the Effective Time, each then outstanding
     employee or other stock option and each then outstanding director stock
     option (each, an "OPTION"), whether or not then vested or exercisable,
     shall be (or, if not previously vested and exercisable, shall become)
     vested and exercisable and such Options immediately thereafter shall be
     cancelled by the Company, and each holder of a cancelled Option shall be
     entitled to receive at the Effective Time or as soon as practicable
     thereafter from the Company (and, if necessary, Parent shall provide funds
     to the Company sufficient for such payments) in consideration for the
     cancellation of such Option an amount in cash equal to the product of (i)
     the number of shares of Company Common Stock previously subject to such
     Option and (ii) the excess, if any, of the Merger Consideration over the
     exercise price per share of Company Common Stock previously subject to such
     Option, less any applicable withholding taxes.

          (b) Immediately prior to the Effective Time, all restrictions on all
     outstanding shares of restricted Company Common Stock granted to employees
     or directors shall lapse, and such shares of Company Common Stock shall be
     converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration in accordance
     with SECTION 1.8(A)(I).

          (c) The Company shall (i) take all actions necessary and appropriate
     so that all stock or other equity based plans maintained with respect to
     the Company Common Stock, including, without limitation, the stock or other
     equity based plans listed on Section 3.1(p) of the Company Disclosure
     Schedule ("OPTION PLANS"), shall terminate as of the Effective Time, (ii)
     use its reasonable best efforts to provide that any other Benefit Plan
     providing for the issuance, transfer or grant of any capital stock of the
     Company or any interest in respect of any capital stock of the Company
     shall be amended to provide that no further issuances, transfers or grants
     shall be permitted from and after the Effective Time, and (iii) use its
     reasonable best efforts to provide that, from and after the Effective Time,
     no holder of an Option or any participant in any Option Plan shall have any
     right thereunder to acquire any capital stock of the Company, Parent or the

                                       A-4

     Surviving Corporation. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall use
     its reasonable best efforts to (x) obtain all necessary consents from, and
     provide (in a form reasonably acceptable to Parent) any required notices
     to, holders of Options and (y) amend the terms of the applicable Option
     Plan, in each case, as is necessary to give effect to the provision of this
     paragraph (c).

                                   ARTICLE II

                            EXCHANGE OF CERTIFICATES

     2.1 EXCHANGE FUND. Prior to the Effective Time, Merger Sub shall appoint a
bank or trust company acceptable to the Company to act as exchange agent (the
"EXCHANGE AGENT") for the payment of the Merger Consideration. At or prior to
the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit or cause to be deposited with the
Exchange Agent, in trust for the benefit of holders of shares of Company Common
Stock, for exchange in accordance with SECTION 1.8, all the cash to be paid
pursuant to this Agreement in exchange for outstanding Company Common Stock. Any
cash deposited with the Exchange Agent shall hereinafter be referred to as the
"EXCHANGE FUND."

     2.2 EXCHANGE PROCEDURES. As promptly as practicable, but in any event
within five (5) Business Days after the Effective Time, the Exchange Agent will
send to each record holder of a Certificate, (i) a letter of transmittal (which
shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the
Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of the Certificates to the Exchange
Agent and shall be in a form and have such other provisions as Parent may
reasonably specify) and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of
the Certificates in exchange for the Merger Consideration. As soon as reasonably
practicable after the Effective Time, each holder of a Certificate, upon
surrender of a Certificate to the Exchange Agent together with such letter of
transmittal, duly executed, and such other documents as may reasonably be
required by the Exchange Agent, shall be entitled to receive in exchange
therefor the Merger Consideration with respect to the aggregate number of shares
of Company Common Stock previously represented by such Certificate. The Exchange
Agent shall accept such Certificates upon compliance with such reasonable terms
and conditions as the Exchange Agent may impose to effect an orderly exchange
thereof in accordance with normal exchange practices. No interest will be paid
or will accrue on any cash payable pursuant to SECTION 1.8. In the event of a
transfer of ownership of Company Common Stock which is not registered in the
transfer records of the Company, a check in the proper amount of cash pursuant
to SECTION 1.8 may be issued with respect to such Company Common Stock to such a
transferee if the Certificate formerly representing such shares of Company
Common Stock is presented to the Exchange Agent, accompanied by all documents
required to evidence and effect such transfer and to evidence that any
applicable stock transfer taxes have been paid.

     2.3 NO FURTHER OWNERSHIP RIGHTS IN COMPANY COMMON STOCK. All cash paid upon
surrender of Certificates in accordance with the terms of ARTICLE I and this
ARTICLE II shall be deemed to have been issued or paid in full satisfaction of
all rights pertaining to the shares of Company Common Stock formerly represented
thereby, except as otherwise provided herein or by law.

                                       A-5

     2.4 TERMINATION OF EXCHANGE FUND. Any portion of the Exchange Fund which
remains undistributed to the holders of Certificates for twelve months after the
Effective Time shall be delivered to the Surviving Corporation or otherwise on
the instruction of the Surviving Corporation, and any holders of Certificates
who have not theretofore complied with this ARTICLE II shall thereafter look
only to the Surviving Corporation (subject to abandoned property, escheat or
other similar laws) for the Merger Consideration to which such holders are
entitled pursuant to SECTION 1.8 with respect to the shares of Company Common
Stock formerly represented thereby.

     2.5 NO LIABILITY. None of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company, the Surviving
Corporation or the Exchange Agent shall be liable to any Person in respect of
any Merger Consideration from the Exchange Fund delivered to a public official
pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar law.

     2.6 INVESTMENT OF THE EXCHANGE FUND. Any funds included in the Exchange
Fund may be invested by the Exchange Agent, as directed by Parent; PROVIDED,
HOWEVER, that such investments shall be in obligations of or guaranteed by the
United States of America and backed by the full faith and credit of the United
States of America or in commercial paper obligations rated A-l or P-1 or better
by Moody's Investors Service, Inc. or Standard & Poor's Corporation,
respectively. Any interest and other income resulting from such investments
shall be paid to Parent upon termination of the Exchange Fund pursuant to
SECTION 2.4 hereof.

     2.7 LOST CERTIFICATES. If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or
destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming
such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by the
Surviving Corporation, the posting by such Person of a bond in such reasonable
amount as the Surviving Corporation may direct as indemnity against any claim
that may be made against it with respect to such Certificate, the Exchange Agent
will deliver in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the
applicable Merger Consideration with respect to the shares of Company Common
Stock formerly represented thereby pursuant to this Agreement.

     2.8 WITHHOLDING RIGHTS. Each of the Exchange Agent, the Surviving
Corporation and Parent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the
consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of
shares of Company Common Stock or Options such amounts as are required to be
deducted and withheld with respect to the making of such payment under the
Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended from time to time (the "CODE"), and
the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, or any provision of state,
local or foreign tax law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld, such
withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having
been paid to the holder of the shares of Company Common Stock or Options in
respect of which such deduction and withholding was made.

                                       A-6

     2.9 FURTHER ASSURANCES. At and after the Effective Time, the officers and
directors of the Surviving Corporation will be authorized to execute and
deliver, in the name and on behalf of the Company or Merger Sub, any deeds,
bills of sale, assignments or assurances and to take and do, in the name and on
behalf of the Company or Merger Sub, any other actions and things to vest,
perfect or confirm of record or otherwise in the Surviving Corporation any and
all right, title and interest in, to and under any of the rights, properties or
assets deemed acquired or to be acquired by the Surviving Corporation as a
result of, or in connection with, the Merger.

     2.10 STOCK TRANSFER BOOKS. At the close of business, New York City time, on
the day the Effective Time occurs, the stock transfer books of the Company shall
be closed and there shall be no further registration of transfers of shares of
Company Common Stock thereafter on the records of the Company. From and after
the Effective Time, the holders of Certificates shall cease to have any rights
with respect to such shares of Company Common Stock formerly represented
thereby, except as otherwise provided herein or by law. On or after the
Effective Time, any Certificates presented to the Exchange Agent, the Surviving
Corporation or Parent for any reason shall be cancelled and exchanged for the
Merger Consideration with respect to the shares of Company Common Stock formerly
represented thereby.

                         REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES

     3.1 REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY. Except as set forth in
the Company Disclosure Schedule delivered by the Company to Parent in connection
with the execution of this Agreement (the "COMPANY DISCLOSURE SCHEDULE") (each
section of which qualifies the correspondingly numbered representation and
warranty or covenant to the extent specified therein and all other
representations and warranties to the extent a matter is disclosed in such a way
as to make its relevance to the information called for by such other
representation and warranty readily apparent), the Company represents and
warrants to Parent as follows:

          (a) ORGANIZATION, STANDING AND POWER. Each of the Company and each of
     its Subsidiaries (i) is a corporation or other entity duly incorporated or
     organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of its
     state of incorporation or organization, (ii) has all requisite power and
     authority to own, lease and operate its properties and to carry on its
     business as now being conducted and (iii) is duly qualified and in good
     standing to do business in each jurisdiction in which the nature of its
     business or the ownership or leasing of its properties makes such
     qualification necessary, except in the case of clause (iii) for such
     failures as would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be
     expected to have a Material Adverse Effect (as defined in SECTION 8.11(F))
     on the Company. The copies of the charter, articles or certificate of
     incorporation and by-laws (or similar governing document) of the Company
     and each of its Subsidiaries which were previously furnished to Parent are
     true, complete and correct copies of such documents as in effect on the

          have been no issuances or deliveries by the Company of shares of its
          capital stock or any other securities of the Company except deliveries
          by the Company of Company Common Stock (and the associated Rights)
          related to open market purchases by the Company of shares of Company

          notes or other indebtedness of the Company having the right to vote on
          any matters on which stockholders may vote ("COMPANY VOTING DEBT") are
          issued or outstanding.

               (iii) Except (A) for the acquisition by stockholders of the
          Company of shares of Company Common Stock pursuant to the Company's
          Dividend Reinvestment Plan (all of which shares shall be acquired
          after the date hereof by the Company for delivery to the applicable
          stockholders of the Company solely through open market purchases), (B)
          for Options and other rights representing in the aggregate the right
          to purchase 3,973,618 shares of Company Common Stock under (1) the

          Company of shares of Company Common Stock pursuant to the Company's
          401(k) Plan (all of which shares shall be acquired after the date
          hereof by the Company solely through open market purchases), as of the
          date of this Agreement, there are no securities, options, warrants,

                                       A-8

          calls, rights, commitments, agreements, arrangements or undertakings
          of any kind to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party
          or by which any of them is bound obligating the Company or any of its
          Subsidiaries to issue, deliver, sell, repurchase, redeem or otherwise
          acquire or cause to be issued, delivered, sold, repurchased, redeemed
          or acquired, shares of capital stock or other voting securities of the
          Company or any of its Subsidiaries or obligating the Company or any of
          its Subsidiaries to issue, grant, extend or enter into any such
          security, option, warrant, call, right, commitment, agreement,
          arrangement or undertaking.

               (iv) All the outstanding shares of capital stock or other
          ownership interests of each Subsidiary of the Company have been
          validly issued and are fully paid and nonassessable and are owned (of
          record and beneficially) by the Company and/or one or more of its
          wholly owned Subsidiaries, free and clear of all pledges, claims,
          liens, charges, encumbrances and security interests of any kind or
          nature whatsoever (collectively, "LIENS"). Except (A) for the capital
          stock or other ownership interests of its Subsidiaries, (B) as
          acquired in the ordinary course of business pursuant to foreclosure,
          workout, settlement or similar transactions, and (C) for security
          interests held in the ordinary course of business, the Company does
          not own, directly or indirectly, any capital stock or other ownership
          interest in any Person that is material to the business of the Company
          and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole.

          (c) AUTHORITY; NO CONFLICTS.

               (i) The Company has all requisite corporate power and authority
          to enter into this Agreement and to consummate the transactions
          contemplated hereby, subject in the case of the consummation of the
          Merger, to the receipt of the Required Company Vote (as defined in
          SECTION 3.1(I)). The execution and delivery of this Agreement and the
          consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby have been duly
          authorized by all necessary corporate action on the part of the
          Company, subject in the case of the consummation of the Merger to the
          receipt of the Required Company Vote. This Agreement has been duly
          executed and delivered by the Company and constitutes a valid and
          binding agreement of the Company, enforceable against it in accordance
          with its terms, except as such enforceability may be limited by
          bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium and similar laws
          relating to or affecting creditors generally, by general equity
          principles (regardless of whether such enforceability is considered in
          a proceeding in equity or at law) or by an implied covenant of good
          faith and fair dealing.

               (ii) The execution and delivery of this Agreement does not, and
          the consummation of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated
          hereby will not, conflict with, or result in any violation of, or
          constitute a default (with or without notice or lapse of time, or
          both) under, or require an offer to purchase to be made under, or give

                                       A-9

          rise to a right of termination, amendment, cancellation or
          acceleration of any obligation or the loss of a material benefit
          under, or the creation of a Lien on any assets (any such conflict,
          violation, default, right of termination, amendment, cancellation or
          acceleration, loss or creation, a "VIOLATION") pursuant to: (A) any
          provision of the charter, articles or certificate of incorporation or
          by-laws or similar governing document of the Company or any Subsidiary
          of the Company, or (B) except as would not, individually or in the
          aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on
          the Company and subject to obtaining or making the consents,
          approvals, orders, authorizations, registrations, declarations and
          filings referred to in paragraph (iii) below, any loan or credit
          agreement, note, mortgage, bond, indenture, lease, benefit plan or
          other agreement, obligation, instrument, permit, concession, franchise
          or license, or any judgment, order, decree, statute, law, ordinance,
          rule or regulation ("LAWS") applicable to the Company or any
          Subsidiary of the Company or their respective properties or assets.

               (iii) No consent, approval, order or authorization of, or
          registration, declaration or filing with, any Person or the United
          States government or any United States domestic state, municipal or
          local government, any instrumentality, subdivision, court,
          administrative agency or commission or other authority thereof, or any
          United States domestic quasi-governmental or private body exercising
          any regulatory, taxing, importing or other United States domestic
          governmental or quasi-governmental authority (a "GOVERNMENTAL
          ENTITY"), is required by the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company
          as a result of the execution and delivery of this Agreement by the
          Company or the consummation of the Merger and the other transactions
          contemplated hereby, except for those required under or in relation to
          (A) the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as
          amended (the "HSR ACT"), (B) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as
          amended (the "EXCHANGE ACT"), (C) the MGCL with respect to the filing
          of the Articles of Merger, (D) the Required Company Vote, (E) the
          rules and regulations of the New York Stock Exchange (the "NYSE"), (F)
          state approvals required in connection with the Surviving
          Corporation's commercial loan and lease origination, servicing and
          selling activities and (G) such consents, approvals, orders,
          authorizations, registrations, declarations and filings the failure of
          which to make or obtain would not, individually or in the aggregate,
          reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on the
          Company. Consents, approvals, orders, authorizations, registrations,
          declarations and filings required under or in relation to any of the
          foregoing clauses (A) through (F) are hereinafter referred to as
          "REQUIRED CONSENTS."

          (d) REPORTS AND FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. The Company has filed all
     material reports, schedules, forms, statements and other documents required
     to be filed by it with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC")
     since January 1, 2000 (collectively, including all exhibits thereto, the

                                      A-10

     "COMPANY SEC REPORTS"). No Subsidiary of the Company is required to file
     any form, report or other document with the SEC. None of the Company SEC
     Reports filed as of their respective dates (or, if amended or superseded by
     a subsequent filing, then as of the date of such filing), as so amended or
     superseded, contained any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to
     state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make
     the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were
     made, not misleading or failed to comply as to form in all material
     respects with the applicable requirements of the Securities Act of 1933, as
     amended, the Exchange Act and, in each case, the rules and regulations
     promulgated thereunder. Each of the consolidated financial statements
     (including the related notes) included in the Company SEC Reports presents
     fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position and
     consolidated results of operations and cash flows of the Company and its
     Subsidiaries as of the respective dates or for the respective periods set
     forth therein, all in conformity with United States generally accepted
     accounting principles ("U.S. GAAP") (except, in the case of unaudited
     consolidated quarterly statements, as permitted by Form 10-Q of the SEC)
     consistently applied during the periods involved except as otherwise noted
     therein, and subject, in the case of the unaudited interim financial
     statements, to normal and recurring year-end adjustments.

          (e) LIABILITIES. Except for (i) liabilities incurred in the ordinary
     course of business consistent with past practice or otherwise permitted
     hereunder, (ii) liabilities arising from this Agreement or the transactions
     contemplated hereby and transaction expenses incurred in connection with
     this Agreement, (iii) liabilities disclosed in the Company SEC Reports
     filed prior to the date hereof, and (iv) liabilities which, individually or
     in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to have a Material
     Adverse Effect on the Company, since the date of the most recent audited
     annual financial statements included in the Company SEC Reports filed with
     the SEC prior to the date of this Agreement (the "FILED AUDITED
     FINANCIALS"), neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has incurred
     any liabilities (whether accrued, absolute, contingent or otherwise and
     whether due or to become due) that would be required to be reflected or
     reserved against in a consolidated balance sheet of the Company and its
     Subsidiaries prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP as applied in preparing
     the fiscal year end consolidated balance sheet of the Company and its
     Subsidiaries contained in the Filed Audited Financials.

          (f) ABSENCE OF CERTAIN CHANGES OR EVENTS. Except as otherwise
     contemplated hereby, from the date of the Filed Audited Financials to the
     date hereof: (i) the Company and its Subsidiaries have conducted their
     business in all material respects in the ordinary course in substantially
     the same manner as heretofore conducted; (ii) there has not been any
     Material Adverse Effect on the Company; (iii) the Company has not declared
     any dividends on or made any other distributions in respect of any of its
     capital stock, except regular quarterly dividends by the Company in an
     amount not in excess of $0.56 per share for each dividend; (iv) the Company
     has not changed its methods of accounting for financial accounting or tax

                                      A-11

     purposes in any manner that would be reasonably expected to have a
     significant adverse effect on its financial statements; (v) the Company has
     not made or revoked any material express or deemed election relating to
     Taxes; and (vi) neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has (A)
     waived in writing any rights which waiver would reasonably be expected to
     have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company, (B) suffered any
     extraordinary loss or extraordinary losses (as defined in Opinion No. 30 of
     the Accounting Principles Board of the American Institute of Certified
     Public Accountants and any amendments or interpretations thereof) which
     would reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on the
     Company, (C) made or agreed to make any material increase in the
     compensation payable or to become payable to any Company Employee, except
     for regularly scheduled increases in compensation payable or increases
     otherwise occurring in the ordinary and usual course of business consistent
     with past practices, (D) made or agreed to make any increase in any Company
     Plan or adopt a new employee benefit plan, which in either case would
     result in a material increase in liability to the Company, or (E) made any
     capital expenditures in respect of its business or operations (excluding
     capital expenditures made in respect of portfolio or other properties held
     or controlled in the course of its business) in excess of $2,500,000 in the
     aggregate.

          (g) INFORMATION SUPPLIED.

               (i) None of the information supplied or to be supplied by the
          Company for inclusion or incorporation by reference in the Proxy
          Statement (as defined in SECTION 5.1(A)), on the date it is first
          mailed to stockholders of the Company or at the time of the Company
          Stockholders Meeting, contains or will contain any untrue statement of
          a material fact or omits or will omit to state any material fact
          required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements
          therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not
          misleading or necessary to correct any statement in any earlier
          communication with respect to the solicitation of proxies for the
          Company Stockholders Meeting which has become false or misleading.

               (ii) Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this SECTION
          3.1(G), no representation or warranty is made by the Company with
          respect to statements made in the Proxy Statement based on information
          supplied by Parent for inclusion therein. For purposes of the
          foregoing, it is understood and agreed that information concerning or
          related to Holdings, Parent or Merger Sub or their respective
          Subsidiaries will be deemed to have been supplied by Parent and
          information concerning or related to the Company and the Company
          Stockholders Meeting shall be deemed to have been supplied by the
          Company.

          (h) BOARD APPROVAL. The Board of Directors of the Company, by
     resolutions duly adopted at a meeting duly called and held and not
     subsequently rescinded or modified in any way (the "BOARD APPROVAL"), has
     duly (i) declared that this Agreement and the Merger and the other

                                      A-12

     transactions contemplated hereby are advisable to, and in the best
     interests of, the Company and its stockholders, (ii) approved this
     Agreement and the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby and
     (iii) recommended that the stockholders of the Company approve the Merger
     and the other transactions contemplated hereby, including the amendment to
     the Company's charter contemplated hereby. The Board Approval (assuming the
     accuracy of the representation in SECTION 3.2(H)) (together with opt-out
     exemptions incorporated in the Company's by-laws) is sufficient to render
     inapplicable to the Merger and this Agreement (and the transactions
     provided for herein) the restrictions on "business combinations" (as
     defined in Subtitle 6 of Title 3 of the MGCL) set forth in Subtitle 6 of
     Title 3 of the MGCL and the limitations on the voting rights of shares of
     stock acquired in a "control share acquisition" (as defined in Subtitle 7
     of Title 3 of the MGCL) set forth in Subtitle 7 of Title 3 of the MGCL, and
     to the knowledge of the Company as of the date hereof, no other state
     business combination or takeover statute or similar statute or regulation
     applies to the Merger and this Agreement (and the transactions provided for
     herein).

          (i) VOTE REQUIRED. The affirmative vote of the holders of a majority
     of the outstanding shares of Company Common Stock entitled to vote (the
     "REQUIRED COMPANY VOTE") is the only vote of the holders of any class or
     series of Company capital stock necessary to approve the Merger and the
     other transactions contemplated hereby, including the amendment to the
     Company's charter contemplated hereby (assuming the accuracy of the
     representation in SECTION 3.2(H)).

          (j) OPINION OF FINANCIAL ADVISOR. The Company has received the opinion
     of Merrill Lynch & Co. (the "FINANCIAL ADVISOR"), dated the date of this
     Agreement, to the effect that, as of such date, the Merger Consideration is
     fair, from a financial point of view, to the holders of the Company Common
     Stock.

          (k) RIGHTS AGREEMENT. The Company has amended the Rights Agreement to
     ensure that (i) none of a "Flip-In Event", a "Distribution Date" or a
     "Stock Acquisition Date" (in each case as defined in the Rights Agreement)
     will occur, and none of Parent, Merger Sub or any of their "Affiliates" or
     "Associates" will be deemed to be an "Acquiring Person" (in each case as
     defined in the Rights Agreement), by reason of the execution and delivery
     of this Agreement or the consummation of the transactions contemplated
     hereby, and (ii) the Rights will expire immediately prior to the Effective
     Time. On or prior to the date hereof, no "Flip-In Event", "Distribution
     Date" or "Stock Acquisition Date" (as defined in the Rights Agreement) has
     occurred.

          (l) RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS. Except for those arrangements,
     agreements and contracts disclosed (or incorporated by reference) in the
     Company SEC Reports filed prior to the date hereof and except for the
     Company Plans, set forth on Section 3.1(l) of the Company Disclosure
     Schedule is a list of all written arrangements, agreements and contracts
     currently in effect entered into by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries

                                      A-13

     with any Person who is an officer, director or affiliate of the Company, or
     any entity of which any of the foregoing is an affiliate, other than those
     arrangements, agreements and understandings which (i) are terminable by the
     Company upon no more than 30 days' prior notice without payment of any
     premium or penalty or (ii) would not, individually or in the aggregate,
     reasonably be expected to create or result in a liability to the Company in
     excess of $100,000.

          (m) LITIGATION. There are no claims, actions, suits, proceedings or
     investigations (collectively, "CLAIMS") pending or, to the knowledge of the
     Company, threatened against the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or any
     properties or rights of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, before any
     Governmental Entity, nor is there any judgment, decree, injunction, ruling
     or order of any Governmental Entity or arbitrator outstanding specifically
     against the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, except for any of the
     foregoing as would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be
     expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company. To the Company's
     knowledge, there has not been any investigation of the Company or any of
     its Subsidiaries conducted by any Governmental Entity during the two years
     prior to the date hereof which was concluded and resulted in a significant
     adverse effect on the ability of the Company and its Subsidiaries to
     conduct their respective businesses.

          (n) COMPLIANCE WITH LAWS; PERMITS. The businesses of the Company and
     its Subsidiaries are not being and have not during the past two years been,
     conducted in violation of any Law of any Governmental Entity, except for
     any violations that would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably
     be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company. The Company
     and each of its Subsidiaries hold all permits, licenses, variances,
     exemptions, authorizations, operating certificates, orders and approvals of
     all Governmental Entities (the "COMPANY PERMITS"), that are required for
     each of them to own, lease or operate their assets and to carry on their
     businesses as presently conducted, except where the failure to hold Company
     Permits would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected
     to have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company. The Company and its
     Subsidiaries have not received any notice of any default under or violation
     of, any such Company Permit, except for such violations or defaults that
     would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have
     a Material Adverse Effect on the Company.

          (o) TAXES.

               (i) The Company and each of its Subsidiaries and any
          consolidated, combined, unitary or aggregate group for tax purposes of
          which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is or has been a member
          has timely filed all income or franchise Tax Returns and all other
          material Tax Returns (as defined below) required to be filed by it
          (after giving effect to any extension properly granted by a Tax
          Authority (as defined below) having authority to do so) and has timely
          paid (or the Company has timely paid on its behalf), or adequately

                                      A-14

          provided for on the Company's financial statements in accordance with
          U.S. GAAP, all income, franchise and other material Taxes (as defined
          below) due and owing except such Taxes that are being contested in
          good faith by appropriate proceedings and for which the Company or any
          of its Subsidiaries shall have set aside on its books adequate
          reserves. Each such Tax Return is complete and accurate in all
          material respects. The most recent financial statements of the Company
          filed with the SEC reflect an adequate reserve for all Taxes payable
          by the Company and its Subsidiaries for all taxable periods and
          portions thereof through the date of such financial statements for
          which no Tax Return is yet due. No material deficiencies for any Taxes
          have been proposed, asserted or assessed in writing against the
          Company or any of its Subsidiaries and, to the knowledge of the
          Company, no such deficiencies otherwise have been proposed, asserted
          or assessed. No requests for waivers of the time to assess any federal
          income taxes or other material Taxes are pending and no extensions of
          time to assess any such Taxes are in effect. There are no material
          pending actions or proceedings by any Tax Authority for assessment or
          collection of any Tax. No claim has been made in writing by a Tax
          Authority in a jurisdiction where the Company or any of its
          Subsidiaries does not file Tax Returns that it is or may be subject to
          taxation by the jurisdiction and, to the knowledge of the Company, no
          such claim otherwise has been made, in both cases, where such claim,
          were it to be sustained, would result in a material Tax liability to
          the Company and/or any of its Subsidiaries. All Taxes required to be
          withheld, collected and paid over to any Tax Authority by the Company
          or any of its Subsidiaries have been timely withheld, collected and
          paid over to the proper Tax Authority. Since the most recent audited
          financial statements contained in thc Company SEC Reports, the Company
          has incurred no liability for Taxes under Sections 857(b), 857(f),
          860(c) or 4981 of the Code, including without limitation any Tax
          arising from a prohibited transaction described in Section 857(b)(6)
          of the Code, determined without regard to the transactions
          contemplated under this Agreement and any actions taken by Parent on
          or after the Closing Date, and since December 31, 2000, neither the
          Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has incurred any material
          liability for Taxes other than in the ordinary course of business,
          determined without regard to the transactions contemplated under this
          Agreement and any actions taken by Parent on or after the Closing
          Date. Determined without regard to the transactions contemplated under
          this Agreement and any actions taken by Parent on or after the Closing
          Date, no event has occurred, and no condition or circumstance exists,
          which presents a material risk and, since December 31, 2000, no event
          has occurred, and no condition or circumstance has arisen, which
          presents a risk that (i) any Tax described in the preceding sentence
          will be imposed upon the Company or any of its Subsidiaries in a
          material amount or (ii) the Company has not or will not qualify as a
          REIT for federal income tax purposes. Complete copies of all federal

                                      A-15

          and all material state and local income or franchise Tax Returns that
          have been filed by the Company and each of its Subsidiaries for all
          taxable years beginning on or after January 1, 1996, all extensions
          filed with any Tax Authority that are currently in effect and all
          written communications with a Tax Authority relating thereto
          (including all examination reports relating thereto), have been made
          available to Parent and the representatives of Parent. Neither the
          Company nor any of its Subsidiaries holds any material asset (A) the
          disposition of which would be subject to rules similar to Section 1374
          of the Code as a result of an election under Internal Revenue Service
          Notice 88-19 or Treas. Reg.ss.1.337-5T, or (B) that is subject to a
          consent filed pursuant to Section 341(f) of the Code and the
          regulations thereunder. Neither the Company nor any of its
          Subsidiaries is obligated, at the date hereof, to make any payment
          that would not be deductible pursuant to Section 162(m) of the Code
          prior to or at the Closing. Neither the Company nor any of its
          Subsidiaries is party to, nor has any liability under (including
          liability with respect to any predecessor entity), any
          indemnification, allocation or sharing agreement with respect to Taxes
          (other than any reimbursement agreement relating to payroll Taxes in
          respect of shared employees). As used in this Agreement, "TAX" or
          "TAXES" shall include all federal, state, local and foreign income,
          property, sales, use, occupancy, transfer, recording, withholding,
          franchise, employment, excise and other taxes, or governmental charges
          of any nature whatsoever, together with penalties, interest or
          additions to tax with respect thereto and any liability in respect of
          Taxes as a transferee, successor, by contract or otherwise. As used in
          this Agreement, "TAX RETURN" or "TAX RETURNS" shall include all
          original and amended returns and reports (including elections, claims,
          declarations, disclosures, estimates, computations and information
          returns) required to be supplied to a Tax Authority in any
          jurisdiction. As used in this Agreement, "TAX AUTHORITY" shall mean
          the Internal Revenue Service and any other domestic or foreign bureau,
          department, entity, agency or other Governmental Entity responsible
          for the administration of any Tax.

               (ii) The Company (x) for all taxable years commencing with the
          taxable year beginning June 1, 1994 through December 31, 2000 has been
          properly subject to taxation as a real estate investment trust within
          the meaning of Section 856 of the Code (a "REIT") and has qualified as
          a REIT for such years, (y) has operated since December 31, 2000, and
          will continue to operate to and including the Closing, in such a
          manner as to qualify as a REIT for its taxable year beginning January
          1, 2001, determined as if such taxable year ended as of the Closing
          and (z) has not taken or omitted to take any action which action or
          omission would reasonably be expected to result in a challenge to its
          status as a REIT and no such challenge is pending or to the Company's
          knowledge threatened; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that the Company shall not be
          deemed to be in breach of this representation by reason of its failure
          to make a distribution in excess of that permitted to be made pursuant
          to Section 4.1(b). Each of the Company's Subsidiaries which is a (x)

                                      A-16

          partnership, joint venture or limited liability company (A) has been
          since its formation and continues to be treated for federal income tax
          purposes as a partnership or disregarded as a separate entity, as the
          case may be, and has not been treated for federal income tax purposes
          as a corporation or an association taxable as a corporation and (B)
          has not since the later of its formation or the acquisition by the
          Company of a direct or indirect interest therein owned any assets
          (including, without limitation, securities) that would cause the
          Company to violate Section 856(c)(4) of the Code, or (y) corporation
          has been since its formation a qualified REIT subsidiary under Section
          856(i) of the Code, except as set forth on Section 3.1(o) of the
          Company Disclosure Schedule. The Company and FFCA Funding Corporation,
          a Delaware corporation ("FUNDING") have properly and timely elected,
          effective for the taxable year beginning on January 1, 2001, to treat
          Funding as a "taxable REIT subsidiary" for purposes of the Code. The
          Company has not elected and will not elect to pay Tax on any capital
          gain recognized on or after January 1, 2001.

               (iii) The representations set forth in this SECTION 3.1(O) that
          are qualified as to Material Adverse Effect on the Company shall be
          deemed to be untrue if the aggregate failures of any such
          representations to be true has a Material Adverse Effect on the
          Company.

     (p) EMPLOYEE BENEFITS; EMPLOYEES.

               (i) Section 3.1(p) of the Company Disclosure Schedule sets forth
          a list of each "employee benefit plan" (within the meaning of Section
          3(3) of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as
          amended ("ERISA")), severance, change in control or employment plan,
          program or agreement, and vacation, incentive, bonus, stock option,
          stock purchase, and restricted stock plan, program or policy sponsored
          or maintained by the Company, any of its Subsidiaries, any of their
          affiliates and any trade or business (whether or not incorporated)
          which is or has ever been under common control, or which is or has
          ever been treated as a single employer, with any of them under Section
          4.14(b), (c), (m) or (o) of the Code ("ERISA AFFILIATE"), in which
          present or former employees of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
          or ERISA Affiliates ("COMPANY EMPLOYEES") participate (collectively,
          the "COMPANY PLANS"). All Company Plans set forth on Section 3.1(p) of
          the Company Disclosure Schedule, if any, that would result in the
          payment to any Company Employee of any money or other property or
          accelerate or provide any other rights or benefits thereto as a result
          of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, whether or not
          such payment or acceleration would constitute a parachute payment
          within the meaning of Code Section 280G, are so indicated by an
          asterisk. The Company Plans are in compliance with all applicable
          requirements of ERISA, the Code, and other applicable Laws and have
          been administered in all material respects in accordance with their

                                      A-17

          terms and such Laws, except where the failure to so comply or be
          administered would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably
          be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company. Each
          Company Plan which is intended to be qualified within the meaning of
          Section 401 of the Code has received a favorable determination letter
          as to its qualification, and, to the knowledge of the Company, nothing
          has occurred that would reasonably be expected to cause the loss of
          such qualification or the loss of the tax-exempt status for any trust
          maintained with respect to any such Company Plan.

               (ii) Except with respect to (A) the Company's Change of Control
          Severance Plan and (B) any liabilities which arise under any Company
          Plans which by their terms are required to be satisfied after the
          Effective Time, neither the Company nor Parent shall, at or after the
          Effective Time, have any liability with respect to any employment,
          change in control, "continuity" or severance agreement, plan, program
          or policy with or with respect to any Company Employee.

               (iii) No Company Plan is subject to Title IV of ERISA (including
          any "multiemployer plan" (as defined in Section 4001(a)(3) of ERISA)),
          and neither the Company nor any of its ERISA Affiliates has ever
          contributed or been obligated to contribute to any pension plan
          subject to Title IV of ERISA (including any multiemployer plan).

               (iv) No event or condition has occurred, to the knowledge of the
          Company, in connection with which the Company or any of its ERISA
          Affiliates would be subject to any liability, encumbrance or Lien with
          respect to any Company Plan under ERISA, the Code or any other
          applicable Law or under any agreement or arrangement pursuant to or
          under which the Company or any of its ERISA Affiliates are required to
          indemnify any person against such liability, where such liability,
          individually or in the aggregate, would reasonably be expected to have
          a Material Adverse Effect on the Company.

               (v) True, correct and complete copies of the following documents
          with respect to each of the Company Plans have been made available or
          delivered to Parent by Company, to the extent applicable: (A) any
          plans or agreements, all amendments thereto and related trust
          documents, and amendments thereto; (B) the most recent Form 5500 and
          all schedules thereto and the most recent actuarial report, if any;
          (C) the most recent IRS determination letter; and (D) any summary plan
          descriptions.

               (vi) With respect to any Company Plan, (A) no actions, suits or
          claims (other than routine claims for benefits in the ordinary course)
          are pending or threatened in writing and (B) to the knowledge of the
          Company, no facts or circumstances exist that could give rise to any

                                      A-18

          such actions, suits or claims, in each case which, individually or in
          the aggregate, would reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse
          Effect on the Company.

               (vii) None of the Company Plans provide for post-employment life
          or health insurance, benefits or coverage for any participant or any
          beneficiary of a participant, except as may be required under the
          Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985, as amended
          ("COBRA") and any such participation is at the expense of the
          participant or the participant's beneficiary.

               (viii) None of the Company Employees is represented in his or her
          capacity as an employee of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries by
          any labor organization, nor has the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
          recognized any labor organization nor has any labor organization been
          elected as the collective bargaining agent of any such employees. To
          the knowledge of the Company, there is no union organization activity
          involving any of the Company Employees, pending or threatened in
          writing, nor has there been any union representation involving such
          employees within the past two years. To the Company's knowledge, there
          are no complaints, charges or claims against the Company or any of its
          Subsidiaries pending or, threatened in writing, by or before any
          Governmental Entity based on, arising out of, in connection with, or
          otherwise relating to the employment or termination of employment or
          failure to employ by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, of any
          individual which would reasonably be expected, individually or in the
          aggregate, to have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company. The
          Company and its Subsidiaries are in compliance with all laws,
          regulations and orders relating to the employment of labor, including
          all such laws, regulations and orders relating to wages, hours, the
          Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act ("WARN") and any
          similar state or local "mass layoff' or "plant closing" law,
          collective bargaining, discrimination, civil rights, safety and
          health, workers' compensation and the collection and payment of
          withholding and/or social security taxes and any similar tax, except
          where the failure to be so in compliance would not be reasonably
          expected, individually or in the aggregate, to have a Material Adverse
          Effect on the Company. There has been no "mass layoff" or "plant
          closing" as defined by WARN with respect to the Company or any of its
          Subsidiaries in the 90 day period immediately prior to the date
          hereof.

          (q) ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS.

               (i) Other than exceptions to any of the following that would not
          result in the Company and its Subsidiaries incurring Environmental
          Liabilities (as hereinafter defined) that would, individually or in
          the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse

                                      A-19

          Effect on the Company (including, for avoidance of doubt, after giving
          effect to any environmental insurance policies for which the Company
          or any of its Subsidiaries is a named insured): (A) the Company and
          its Subsidiaries and, to the knowledge of the Company, all Owned Real
          Property or any real property on which the Company or its Subsidiaries
          have a mortgage, are in compliance with applicable Environmental Laws
          (as hereinafter defined); (B) there are no Environmental Claims (as
          hereinafter defined) pending or, to the knowledge of the Company,
          threatened against the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or, to the
          knowledge of the Company, with respect to any Owned Real Property or
          any real property on which the Company or its Subsidiaries has a
          mortgage; and (C) there are no facts, circumstances or conditions
          associated with the Company or its Subsidiaries or any Owned Real
          Property, Leased Real Property or real property over which the Company
          or its Subsidiaries exercise day-to-day control or, to the knowledge
          of the Company, any real property on which the Company or any of its
          Subsidiaries has a mortgage, that, individually or in the aggregate,
          would reasonably be expected to result in the assertion of an
          Environmental Claim against the Company or its Subsidiaries or
          otherwise result in the Company or its Subsidiaries incurring any
          Environmental Liability.

               (ii) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is a party
          to any order or, to the knowledge of the Company, any written
          agreement pursuant to which any of them is obligated under any
          applicable Environmental Law to remediate any condition relating to
          any Hazardous Materials.

               (iii) Notwithstanding the generality of any other representations
          and warranties in this Agreement, the representations and warranties
          in this SECTION 3.1(Q) are the only representations and warranties in
          this Agreement with respect to Environmental Laws or Hazardous

          reasonably be expected to result in liability of the Company or any of
          its Subsidiaries.

          (r) PROPERTIES. Except for any exceptions to the following as would
     not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a
     Material Adverse Effect on the Company: (i) each of the Company and its
     Subsidiaries has good and valid fee simple title to the real property owned
     by it (the "OWNED REAL Property"), free and clear of all Liens other than
     Permitted Liens (as defined in SECTION 8.11(G)); (ii) each of the Company
     and its Subsidiaries has valid leasehold interests in the real property

     PROPERTY", and together with the Owned Real Property, the "REAL PROPERTY"),
     free and clear of all Liens other than Permitted Liens; (iii) all leases
     pursuant to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries leases (as
     landlord or as tenant) any Real Property are in full force and effect and

     they purport to grant; and (iv) the Company and its Subsidiaries have not
     received any notice of any default either on the part of the Company or any
     of its Subsidiaries under any such lease and, to the knowledge of the
     Company, no event has occurred which, with notice or the lapse of time, or
     both, would constitute a default on the part of the Company or any of its
     Subsidiaries under any of such leases. Funding, a wholly owned Subsidiary
     of the Company, has good and valid fee simple title to the Company's
     headquarters location at 17207 North Perimeter Drive, Scottsdale, Arizona,

     Schedule, in each case, free and clear of all Liens other than Permitted

          (s) CONTRACTS. From the last day to which the Company's most recently
     filed Form 10-K or Form 10-Q relates, whichever is later, to the date
     hereof, neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has entered into
     any contract, agreement or other document or instrument (i) (other than
     this Agreement) that is required to be filed with the SEC that has not been
     so filed or any material amendment or modification to, or waiver under, any
     such contract, (ii) that would be required to be disclosed under Item 404
     of Regulation S-K under the Securities Act, or (iii) related to voting or
     governing how any shares of Company Common Stock shall be voted (the
     documents referred to in clauses (i) through (iii), together with all
     contracts, agreements or other documents or instruments listed in Item 14
     of the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K most recently filed with the
     SEC which are in effect on the date hereof or listed on Section 3.1(s) of
     the Company Disclosure Schedule, are collectively referred to as the
     "MATERIAL CONTRACTS"). The Company and its Subsidiaries have not received
     any notice of any default under any Material Contract either by the Company
     or any of its Subsidiaries which is a party thereto or by any other party
     thereto which would, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be
     expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company, and to the
     knowledge of the Company, no event has occurred that with the lapse of time
     or the giving of notice or both would constitute such a default by the
     Company or such Subsidiary or any other party thereto. Neither the Company
     nor any of its Subsidiaries is subject to or bound by any exclusive dealing

                                      A-22

     arrangement, or other contract or arrangement, containing covenants which
     materially limit the ability of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to
     compete in any line of business or with any person or which involve any
     material restriction of geographical area in which, or method by which, the
     Company or any of its Subsidiaries may carry on its business (other than as
     may required by Law or any applicable Governmental Entity). The aggregate
     amounts payable to the Executives pursuant to Sections 7(a)(i)(A),
     7(a)(i)(C)(ii) and 9 of the Employment Agreements between the Company and
     each of the Executives shall not exceed $23 million. The aggregate amounts
     payable to other employees of the Company or its Subsidiaries pursuant to
     Sections 4(a), 4(b)(i), 4(b)(iii) and 6 of the Continuity Agreements
     between the Company and any such employee and the aggregate amounts payable
     pursuant to the Change of Control Severance Plan for Certain Covered
     Executives of the Company would not reasonably be expected to have a
     Material Adverse Effect with respect to the Company.

          (t) DISPOSITION PROPERTIES. To the Company's knowledge, ANNEX A hereto
     sets forth a true and complete list of each parcel of Owned Real Property
     or real property over which the Company exercises day-to-day control on

     of, gasoline is located.

          (u) BROKERS OR FINDERS. No agent, broker, investment banker, financial
     advisor or other firm or Person is or will be entitled to any broker's or
     finder's fee or any other similar commission or fee in connection with any
     of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement based upon arrangements
     made by or on behalf of the Company, except the Financial Advisor, whose
     fees and expenses will be paid by the Company in accordance with the
     Company's agreement with such firm, based upon arrangements made by or on
     behalf of the Company and previously disclosed to Parent.

          (v) INSURANCE. The Company and its Subsidiaries are insured with
     reputable insurers against such risks and in such amounts as the management
     of the Company reasonably has determined to be prudent in accordance with
     industry practices or as is required by Law. Set forth on Section 3.1(v) of
     the Company Disclosure Schedule is a list of all insurance policies
     acquired or maintained by the Company or its Subsidiaries specifically with
     respect to any potential Environmental Claims or Environmental Liabilities
     (the "ENVIRONMENTAL POLICIES"). Except as would not, individually or in the
     aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on the
     Company, (i) all of the insurance policies, binders or bonds acquired or
     maintained by the Company or its Subsidiaries, other than the Environmental
     Policies, (the "POLICIES") are in full force and effect and neither the
     Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is in default thereunder and (ii) all
     claims under the Policies have been filed in due and timely fashion. All of
     the Environmental Policies are in full force and effect and neither the
     Company nor any of its Subsidiaries are in default thereunder and all
     claims under the Environmental Policies have been filed in due and timely

                                      A-23

     fashion, except for any lack of such effectiveness, default or untimely
     claim that is not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably likely to
     result in the incurrence of a liability or loss on the part of the Company
     or any of its Subsidiaries in excess of $500,000.

          (w) INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY. Except as would not, individually or in the
     aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on the
     Company: (i) the Company and its Subsidiaries own or have the right to use,
     and following the Closing will continue to own or have the right to use all
     significant proprietary systems and databases used by the Company and its
     Subsidiaries to conduct their businesses as currently conducted which are
     not generally commercially available ("SYSTEMS") without the necessity of
     obtaining a consent or payment of any additional, material license fees or
     other material payments; (ii) neither the Company nor any of its
     Subsidiaries has granted any unaffiliated third party access to or the
     right to use or access such Systems; (iii) to the Company's knowledge, no
     unaffiliated third party has obtained access to or copies of the Systems
     by, through or from the Company or any of its Subsidiaries; (iv) the sale,
     license, lease, transfer, use, reproduction, distribution, modification or
     other exploitation by the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company of any
     Systems (as such Systems are currently used or otherwise exploited by the
     Company) does not (A) infringe on any valid and subsisting patent,
     trademark, copyright or other right of any other Person, (B) constitute a
     misuse or misappropriation of any valid rights in any trade secret,
     know-how, process or proprietary information of any other Person, or (C)
     entitle any other Person to any interest therein, or right to compensation
     from the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company, by reason thereof (it
     being understood and agreed that insofar as each of the foregoing
     representations and warranties relate to any System that is licensed to the
     Company or any Subsidiary of the Company by any third party, such
     representations and warranties are made to the Company's knowledge); and
     (v) neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has received any
     complaint, assertion, threat or allegation or otherwise has notice of any
     lawsuit, claim, demand, proceeding or investigation involving matters of
     the type contemplated by clause (iv) above, or has knowledge of any facts
     or circumstances that would reasonably be expected to give rise to any such
     lawsuit, claim, demand, proceeding or investigation.

          (x) DATA TAPE. The Company has furnished or made available to Parent a
     data tape which provides certain information with respect to loans and
     leases of the Company and its Subsidiaries (the "DATA TAPE"). To the
     knowledge of the Company, except as would not, individually or in the
     aggregate, reasonably be likely to have a Material Adverse Effect on the
     Company, the Data Tape was prepared in good faith by the Company in
     accordance with the books and records of the Company and its Subsidiaries

          limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium and
          similar laws relating to or affecting creditors generally, by general
          equity principles (regardless of whether such enforceability is
          considered in a proceeding in equity or at law) or by an implied
          covenant of good faith and fair dealing.

               (ii) The execution and delivery of this Agreement does not, and

          Consents and such consents, approvals, orders, authorizations,
          registrations, declarations and filings the failure of which to make

the terms and conditions set forth on Section 5.2 of the Company Disclosure
Schedule. Parent agrees to use its reasonable best efforts to cooperate and
assist the Company to effect the Disposition as promptly as practicable after
the date hereof, and shall take all actions that are designated to be taken by
Parent or its Subsidiaries set forth on Section 5.2 of the Company Disclosure
Schedule. From time to time during the period commencing on the date hereof and
ending immediately prior to the Effective Time, each of the Company and Parent
may supplement ANNEX A to include additional Owned Real Property on which an
underground storage tank containing, or intended for the storage of, gasoline is
located by delivery of written notice pursuant to SECTION 8.2 hereof.

     5.3 ACCESS TO INFORMATION.

          (a) Upon reasonable notice, the Company shall (and shall cause its
     Subsidiaries to), subject to any limitations in loan, lease or other
     documentation, afford to the officers, employees, accountants, counsel,
     financial advisors and other representatives of Parent reasonable access
     during normal business hours, during the period prior to the Effective
     Time, to all its properties, books, contracts, officers, employees,
     commitments and records and, during such period, the Company shall (and
     shall cause its Subsidiaries to) furnish promptly to Parent (i) a copy of
     (A) each material report, schedule, registration statement and other
     document filed, published, announced or received by it during such period
     pursuant to the requirements of federal or state securities laws, as
     applicable (other than reports or documents which such party is not
     permitted to disclose under applicable law) and (B) each compliance
     certificate delivered by it pursuant to any of the facilities listed in
     Section 5.3(a) of the Company Disclosure Schedule, and (ii) consistent with
     its legal obligations, all other information concerning its business,
     properties and personnel as Parent may reasonably request; PROVIDED,
     HOWEVER, that Company may restrict the foregoing access to the extent that
     any Law of any Governmental Entity (which, for purposes of this SECTION 5.3
     shall include any foreign governmental entities) applicable to the Company
     or any existing agreement requires the Company or its Subsidiaries to
     restrict access to any properties or information.

                                      A-33

          (b) Parent and its representatives will hold any such information in
     confidence to the extent required by, and in accordance with, the
     provisions of the letter dated April 8, 1999 between the Company and Parent
     (the "CONFIDENTIALITY AGREEMENT").

          (c) Any investigation by Parent shall not affect the representations
     and warranties of the Company.

     5.4 REASONABLE BEST EFFORTS.

          (a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, each party
     will (i) use its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all
     actions and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or
     advisable under applicable Laws and otherwise to consummate the Merger and
     the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement as soon as
     practicable after the date hereof, including with respect to obtaining the
     opinion referred to in SECTION 6.2(C) hereof, and all permits, consents,
     approvals and authorizations of all third parties and Governmental Entities
     necessary or advisable in order to consummate the transactions contemplated
     by this Agreement and (ii) keep the other party apprised of the status of
     matters relating to completion of the transactions contemplated hereby.
     Subject to applicable Laws relating to the exchange of information, each of
     the Company and Parent shall have the right to review in advance, and will
     consult with the other with respect to, all the information relating to the
     other party and each of their respective Subsidiaries, which appears in any
     filings, announcements or publications made with, or written materials
     submitted to, any third party or any Governmental Entity in connection with
     the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. In exercising the
     foregoing right, each of the parties hereto agrees to act reasonably and as
     promptly as practicable.

          (b) In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, each party
     hereto agrees to make an appropriate filing of a Notification and Report
     Form pursuant to the HSR Act with respect to the transactions contemplated
     hereby as promptly as practicable, and in any event within five (5)
     Business Days of the date hereof, and to supply as promptly as practicable
     any additional information and documentary material that may be requested
     pursuant to the HSR Act and to take all other actions necessary to cause
     the expiration or termination of the applicable waiting periods under the
     HSR Act as soon as practicable. Nothing in this SECTION 5.4 shall require
     the Company, Merger Sub, Parent or any of their respective Subsidiaries to
     sell, hold separate or otherwise dispose of or conduct their respective
     businesses in a specified manner, whether as a condition to obtaining any
     approval from a Governmental Entity or any other Person or for any other
     reason, if such sale, holding separate or other disposition or the conduct
     of their business in a specified manner would reasonably be expected to
     have a material adverse effect on the business, financial condition or
     results of operations of either the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as
     a whole or the BAF Business (as defined below) (it being understood that
     (i) any obligation of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries to sell, hold
     separate or otherwise dispose of or conduct its business in a specified

                                      A-34

     manner, is strictly limited to the assets, properties and operations of (A)
     the franchise finance business conducted by Parent under the name of
     "Business Asset Funding" (the "BAF BUSINESS") and (B) in addition to the
     obligations under clause (i)(A) above, after the Effective Time, the
     Company and its Subsidiaries, (ii) in no event shall Parent or any of its
     Subsidiaries have any obligation to sell, hold separate or otherwise
     dispose of or conduct any of its businesses in a specified manner other
     than the BAF Business and, after the Effective Time, that of the Company
     and its Subsidiaries and (iii) in the case of any such action required of
     Parent or Merger Sub or their respective Subsidiaries, the determination of
     such a material adverse effect will be measured instead against aggregate
     business, financial condition or results of operations of the BAF Business
     that would be equivalent economically to the aggregate assets and
     businesses of the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole).

          (c) Each of Parent and the Company shall, in connection with the
     efforts referenced in SECTION 5.4(B) to obtain all requisite approvals and
     authorizations for the transactions contemplated by this Agreement under
     the HSR Act or any other Regulatory Law (as defined below), use its
     reasonable best efforts to (i) cooperate in all respects with each other in
     connection with any filing or submission and in connection with any
     investigation or other inquiry, including any proceeding initiated by a
     private party, (ii) promptly inform the other party of any communication
     received by such party from, or given by such party to, the Antitrust
     Division of the Department of Justice (the "DOJ"), the Federal Trade
     Commission (the "FTC") or any other Governmental Entity (including any
     foreign governmental entity) and of any material communication received or
     given in connection with any proceeding by a private party, in each case,
     regarding any of the transactions contemplated hereby, and (iii) permit the
     other party to review any communication given by it to, and consult with
     each other in advance of any meeting or conference with, the DOJ, the FTC
     or any such other Governmental Entity (including any foreign governmental
     entity) or, in connection with any proceeding by a private party, with any
     other Person, and to the extent permitted by the DOJ, the FTC or such other
     applicable Governmental Entity (including any foreign governmental entity)
     or other Person, give the other party the opportunity to attend and
     participate in such meetings and conferences. For purposes of this
     Agreement, "REGULATORY LAW" means the Sherman Act, as amended, the Clayton
     Act, as amended, the HSR Act, the Federal Trade Commission Act, as amended,
     and all other federal, state and foreign, if any, statutes, rules,
     regulations, orders, decrees, administrative and judicial doctrines and
     other laws that are designed or intended to prohibit, restrict or regulate
     actions having the purpose or effect of monopolization or restraint of
     trade or lessening of competition through merger or acquisition.

          (d) In furtherance and not in limitation of the covenants of the
     parties contained in this SECTION 5.4, if any administrative or judicial
     action or proceeding, including any proceeding by a private party, is
     instituted (or threatened to be instituted) challenging any transaction
     contemplated by this Agreement as violative of any Regulatory Law, each of
     Parent and the Company shall cooperate in all respects with each other and

                                      A-35

     use its respective reasonable best efforts to resolve, contest and resist
     any such action or proceeding and to have vacated, lifted, reversed or
     overturned any decree, judgment, injunction or other order, whether
     temporary, preliminary or permanent, that is in effect and that prohibits,
     prevents or restricts consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
     Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing or any other provision of this
     Agreement, nothing in this SECTION 5.4 shall limit a party's right to
     terminate this Agreement pursuant to SECTION 7.1(B) or 7.1(C).

     5.5 ACQUISITION PROPOSALS. The Company agrees that after the date hereof
neither it nor any of its Subsidiaries nor any of the officers and directors of
it or its Subsidiaries shall, and that it shall direct and use its reasonable
best efforts to cause its and its Subsidiaries' employees, agents and
representatives (including any investment banker, attorney or accountant
retained by it or any of its Subsidiaries) not to, directly or indirectly,
initiate, solicit or knowingly encourage any inquiries or the making of any
proposal or offer with respect to a merger, reorganization, share exchange,
consolidation, business combination, recapitalization, liquidation, dissolution
or similar transaction involving it or any of its material Subsidiaries, or any
purchase or sale of all or 20% or more of the equity securities of it or any of
its material Subsidiaries or of the assets of it and its Subsidiaries taken as a
whole (any such proposal or offer, other than a proposal or offer made by Parent
or an affiliate thereof, being hereinafter referred to as an "ACQUISITION
PROPOSAL"); PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that the Company may take any of the foregoing
actions to the extent such actions are in connection with any transaction
permitted under SECTION 4.1(E) or 4.1(F). The Company further agrees that
neither it nor any of its Subsidiaries nor any of the officers and directors of
it or its Subsidiaries shall, and that it shall direct and use its reasonable
best efforts to cause its and its Subsidiaries' employees, agents and
representatives (including any investment banker, attorney or accountant
retained by it or any of its Subsidiaries) not to, directly or indirectly, have
any discussion with or provide any confidential information or data to any
Person relating to an Acquisition Proposal, or engage in any negotiations
concerning an Acquisition Proposal, or accept an Acquisition Proposal.
Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the Company and its
Board of Directors, including all of the aforementioned Persons, shall be
permitted to (A) to the extent applicable, comply with Rule 14d-9 and Rule
14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act with regard to an Acquisition
Proposal, and (B) in response to an unsolicited bona fide written Acquisition
Proposal by any Person, (I) furnish information to, request information from,
and engage in discussions or negotiations with the Person making such
Acquisition Proposal and (II) recommend such an unsolicited bona fide written
Acquisition Proposal to the stockholders of the Company, or withdraw or modify
in any adverse manner its approval or recommendation of this Agreement, if and
only to the extent that, in any such case as is referred to in clause (B), (i)
the Board of Directors of the Company concludes in good faith that such
Acquisition Proposal (x) in the case of clause (I) above could reasonably be
expected to constitute or result in a Superior Proposal or (y) in the case of
clause (II) above constitutes a Superior Proposal (after giving effect to any
concessions which are offered by Parent, if any, following delivery of notice to
Parent required pursuant to SECTION 7.1(F)), and (ii) prior to providing any
information to any Person in connection with an Acquisition Proposal by any such

                                      A-36

Person, the Company receives from such Person an executed confidentiality
agreement and standstill agreement no less favorable in the aggregate to the
Company than the Confidentiality Agreement. The Company agrees that it will keep
Parent informed as promptly as practicable (but in any case by the end of the
next Business Day) of the status and material terms of any such proposals or
offers, including any material revisions thereof, and any material developments
in the status of any such material discussions or negotiations, including the
identity of any Person making an Acquisition Proposal. The Company agrees that
it will immediately cease and cause to be terminated any existing activities,
discussions or negotiations with any parties conducted heretofore with respect
to any Acquisition Proposal.

     5.6 EMPLOYEE BENEFITS MATTERS.

          (a) Effective immediately prior to the Effective Time, the Company
     shall and shall cause its Subsidiaries to terminate any Company Plans which
     are tax-qualified 401(k) plans, and any Company Employees who are employed
     by the Surviving Corporation shall be allowed to roll over their accounts
     under such plan to a 401(k) plan offered by Parent or one of its affiliates
     following the Effective Time.

               (i) for at least 18 months after the Effective Time, Parent
          shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, provide the
          Company Employees with base salaries that are at least equal to the
          respective base salaries of such Company Employees immediately prior
          to the Effective Time; and

               (ii) for the period commencing on the Effective Time and ending
          on December 31, 2002, Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving
          Corporation to, provide Company Employees with (A) bonus opportunities
          (limited, for purposes of this SECTION 5.6(B)(II)(A), solely to the
          cash component thereof) that are the same as, or substantially
          equivalent to, those provided to such Company Employees immediately
          prior to the Effective Time, and (B) benefits (other than those
          described in SECTIONS 5.6(B)(I) and 5.6(B)(II)(A) above) that are the
          same as, or substantially equivalent to, those provided to similarly
          situated employees of Parent.

               Nothing contained in SECTION 5.6(B)(I) or 5.6(B)(II) shall
          prevent Parent from causing the Company Employees to be provided with
          benefits under Benefit Plans maintained by Parent or any of its
          affiliates which comply with the foregoing provisions.

          (c) Parent will, or will cause the Surviving Corporation to: (i) waive
     all limitations as to preexisting conditions, exclusions and waiting
     periods with respect to participation and coverage requirements applicable
     to the Company Employees under any Benefit Plan in which such employees may
     be eligible to participate after the Effective Time; (ii) provide each

                                      A-37

     Company Employee with credit for any co-payments and deductibles paid in
     the calendar year in which the Effective Time occurs in satisfying any
     applicable deductible or out-of-pocket requirements under any welfare
     Benefit Plans in which such employees are eligible to participate after the
     Effective Time; and (iii) provide each Company Employee with credit for all
     purposes (other than for the purpose of benefit accruals under any
     qualified or nonqualified defined benefit pension plan) for all service
     with the Company and its affiliates (to the extent such service was
     credited under the applicable Company Plans) under each Benefit Plan of the
     Parent or its affiliates in which such employees become eligible to
     participate after the Effective Time.

          (d) In lieu of the annual bonus otherwise payable in respect of the
     portion of the calendar year ending prior to the Effective Time to Company
     Employees who are eligible, immediately prior to the Effective Time, to
     receive such bonus, Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation
     to, pay in the aggregate for the benefit of all such Company Employees, an
     amount for such calendar year set forth on Section 5.6(d) of the Company
     Disclosure Schedule (the "2001 BONUS AMOUNT") prorated on a daily basis
     from January 1 of the calendar year in which the Effective Time occurs
     through the Effective Time. The allocation of the 2001 Bonus Amount shall
     be made (i) in the case of the Executives, based on the recommendation of
     the Compensation Committee and approved by the Board of Directors of the
     Company, and (ii) in the case of any other Company Employee, based on the
     recommendation of the Executives and approved by the Compensation Committee
     and the Board of Directors of the Company. The payment of the 2001 Bonus
     Amount shall be made as soon as practicable after the Effective Time, but
     in no event later than 60 days after the Effective Time.

          (e) Immediately prior to the Effective Time, the Option Period (as
     defined in the Company's 1997 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the "ESPP")),
     shall be terminated in accordance with the terms of SECTION 1.9(C) hereof,
     and Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, pay to all
     participants in the ESPP the per share Merger Consideration in respect of
     the shares of Company Common Stock (including fractional shares, in
     accordance with the terms of the ESPP) that such participants would
     otherwise have been eligible to receive at such time. The Company shall
     take all such actions as may be necessary to effect the foregoing.

          (f) The Company shall terminate each of the Company Employees set
     forth on Section 5.6(f) of the Company Disclosure Schedule prior to the
     Effective Time and the Company shall have performed all obligations to such
     Company Employees under all applicable Company Plans, except for those
     obligations which by their terms are to be performed after the Effective
     Time.

     5.7 FEES AND EXPENSES. Whether or not the Merger is consummated, all
Expenses (as defined below) incurred in connection with this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby shall be paid by the party incurring such
Expenses, except if the Merger is consummated, the Surviving Corporation shall
pay, or cause to be paid, any and all property or transfer taxes imposed on the

                                      A-38

Company or its Subsidiaries and any real property transfer tax imposed on any

     5.8 DIRECTORS' AND OFFICERS' INDEMNITY.

          (a) Parent agrees that from and after the Effective Time it will or
     will cause the Surviving Corporation to indemnify and hold harmless each
     present and former director and officer of the Company and other persons
     entitled to indemnification under the charter and by-laws or similar
     organizational documents of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries as in
     effect on the date hereof ("COVERED PERSONS") against any costs or expenses
     (including reasonable attorneys' fees), judgments, fines, losses, claims,
     damages or liabilities (collectively, "COSTS") incurred in connection with
     any claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, whether civil,
     criminal, administrative or investigative, arising out of or pertaining to
     matters existing or occurring at or prior to the Effective Time, whether
     asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the Effective Time, to the
     fullest extent permitted under applicable Law (and Parent shall, or shall
     cause the Surviving Corporation to, also advance expenses as incurred to
     the fullest extent permitted under applicable Law; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that
     if required under applicable Law, the person to whom expenses are advanced
     provides an undertaking to repay such advances if it is ultimately
     determined that such person is not entitled to indemnification). Each
     Covered Person will be entitled to advancement of expenses incurred in the
     defense of any claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation from Parent
     and the Surviving Corporation within ten (10) Business Days of receipt from
     the Covered Party of a request therefor; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that any person
     to whom expenses are advanced provides an undertaking, to the extent
     required by the MGCL, to repay such advances if it is ultimately determined
     that such person is not entitled to indemnification.

          (b) Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation and all other
     Subsidiaries of the Company to maintain for a period of at least six years
     the current policies of directors' and officers' liability insurance and
     fiduciary liability insurance maintained by the Company (PROVIDED that the
     Surviving Corporation may substitute therefor policies of at least the same
     coverage and amounts provided by reputable and financially sound insurance
     companies containing terms and conditions which are, in the aggregate, no
     less advantageous to the insured) with respect to claims arising from facts
     or events that occurred on or before the Effective Time, including in
     respect of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; PROVIDED,

                                      A-39

     HOWEVER, that in no event shall the Surviving Corporation be required to
     pay premiums therefor in any one year in an amount in excess of 200% of the
     annual premiums currently paid by the Company for such insurance; PROVIDED,
     FURTHER, that if the annual premiums of such insurance coverage exceed such
     amount, the Surviving Corporation shall be obligated to obtain a policy
     with the greatest coverage available for a cost not exceeding such amount.
     The provisions of the immediately preceding sentence shall be deemed to
     have been satisfied if prepaid policies have been obtained by the Company
     prior to the Closing for purposes of this SECTION 5.8, which policies
     provide such directors and officers with coverage for an aggregate period
     of not less than six years with respect to claims arising from facts or
     events that occurred on or before the Effective Time, including in respect
     of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. If such prepaid
     policies have been obtained by the Company prior to the Closing, Parent
     shall and shall cause the Surviving Corporation to maintain such policies
     in full force and effect, and continue to honor the Company's obligations
     thereunder.

          (c) If Parent, the Surviving Corporation, any of its Subsidiaries or
     any of their successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges with or
     into any other Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving
     corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers or
     conveys all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any
     Person, then, and in each such case, to the extent necessary, proper
     provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of Parent, the
     Surviving Corporation, such Subsidiary or such successor or assign assume
     the obligations set forth in this SECTION 5.8.

          (d) This SECTION 5.8 is intended to benefit and shall be enforceable
     by the Covered Persons and their respective heirs, executors and personal
     representatives and shall be binding on and enforceable against Parent,
     Merger Sub and the Surviving Corporation and their successors and assigns.

     5.9 SALE OF SECURITIZATION INTERESTS. Immediately prior to the Effective
Time, Parent shall cause Galahad, which shall be a REIT eligible under the terms
of the securitizations of the Company set forth on Section 5.9 of the Company
Disclosure Schedule to own all of the capital stock of FRIC and the
Securitization Interests, to purchase, and the Company shall sell or cause to be
sold, all of the Securitization Interests for the consideration set forth on
Section 5.9 of the Company Disclosure Schedule; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that in no
event shall such purchase and sale (i) reduce, alter or otherwise change the
Merger Consideration to be paid to the Company's stockholders pursuant to
SECTION 1.8 or (ii) impede or delay the Closing of the Merger. The sale of the
Securitization Interests shall, at Parent's election (to be made at least 5
business days prior to Closing), be in the form of a transfer of all of the
capital stock of FRIC and/or an assignment and transfer of the Securitization
Interests. Each of the Company and Parent shall take (or shall cause to be
taken) all actions and shall execute (or shall cause to be executed) all
documents as are reasonably necessary to effect the transactions contemplated by
this SECTION 5.9.

     5.10 PUBLIC ANNOUNCEMENTS. The Company and Parent shall use all reasonable
efforts to develop a joint communications plan and each party shall use all
reasonable efforts (i) to ensure that all press releases and other public
statements with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby shall be
consistent with such joint communications plan, and (ii) unless otherwise
required by applicable Law or by obligations pursuant to any listing agreement
with or rules of any securities exchange, to consult with each other before
issuing any press release or otherwise making any public statement with respect

     correct, or true and correct in all material respects, as applicable, as of
     such date); PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that if the foregoing provisions of this

                                      A-41

     paragraph (a) shall not be satisfied, such provisions shall nevertheless be
     deemed to be satisfied so long as all failures of such representations and
     warranties to be so true and correct, taken together, would not reasonably
     be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company; and PROVIDED,
     FURTHER that notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth
     hereinabove, the provisions of this paragraph (a) shall not be satisfied if
     the representations and warranties of the Company set forth in SECTION
     3.1(T) shall not be true and correct in all respects as of the Closing Date
     (after giving effect to any additions to ANNEX A hereto as permitted
     pursuant to SECTION 5.2 hereof); and Parent shall have received a
     certificate of the chief executive officer and the chief financial officer
     of the Company certifying to the satisfaction of the conditions set forth
     in this SECTION 6.2(A).

          (b) PERFORMANCE OF OBLIGATIONS OF THE COMPANY. The Company shall have
     performed or complied with all agreements and covenants required to be
     performed by it under this Agreement at or prior to the Closing Date that
     are qualified as to materiality and shall have performed or complied in all
     material respects with all other agreements and covenants required to be
     performed by it under this Agreement at or prior to the Closing Date that
     are not so qualified as to materiality, and Parent shall have received a
     certificate of the chief executive officer and the chief financial officer
     of the Company to such effect.

          (c) REIT AND SUBSIDIARY STATUS OPINION. Parent shall have received an
     opinion of Kutak Rock LLP, or other counsel to the Company reasonably
     acceptable to Parent, dated as of the Effective Time, substantially in the
     form of EXHIBIT 6.2(C) and with no substantive change in the legal
     conclusions, legal analysis or qualifications or limitations set forth in
     EXHIBIT 6.2(C). Such opinion may be based on the certificate substantially
     in the form attached as EXHIBIT 6.2(C), PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that there are
     no substantive changes in the statements or representations set forth in
     such Exhibit and no assumptions or representations are added that are not
     set forth in such Exhibit.

          (d) [Intentionally Omitted].

          (e) NO MATERIAL ADVERSE CHANGE. Since the date of this Agreement
     through and including the time immediately prior to the Effective Time,
     there shall not have been any changes, circumstances or effects which,
     individually or in the aggregate, have had or would reasonably be expected
     to have, a Material Adverse Effect on the Company.

          (f) NO GOVERNMENTAL SUITS. There shall not be pending or threatened
     (as evidenced by a writing), any suit, action or proceeding by a federal,
     state or foreign governmental entity (other than a suit, action or
     proceeding based on facts solely relating to Parent or Merger Sub or any of
     their respective Subsidiaries) which would reasonably be expected to (i)
     restrain, prohibit or declare illegal the consummation of the Merger, (ii)
     in connection with the Merger, prohibit or impose any material limitations
     on Parent's or Merger Sub's ownership or operation (or that of any of their

                                      A-42

     respective affiliates) of all or a material portion of the Company's
     businesses or assets after giving effect to the Merger, or (iii) in
     connection with the Merger, compel Parent or Merger Sub or their respective
     Subsidiaries and affiliates to dispose of or hold separate (A) any material
     portion of the business or assets of the BAF Business or (B) any portion of
     the business or assets of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (after
     giving effect to the Merger), if such disposition or holding separate would
     reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on the business,
     financial condition or results of operations of the Company and its
     Subsidiaries, taken as a whole.

          (g) NO ADVERSE CHANGES IN TAX LAWS. No "change of law" shall have
     occurred after the date hereof and be continuing as a result of which it
     would reasonably be expected (after taking into account, in the case of
     prospective changes of law, the likelihood of such change of law occurring)
     that at the Effective Time there would be a material risk that the Company
     would not qualify at or prior to the Effective Time as a REIT. For this
     purpose, the term "change in law" shall mean any amendment to or change
     (including any announced prospective change having a proposed effective
     date at or prior to the Effective Time) in the federal tax laws of the
     United States or any provision of the federal securities laws of the United
     States containing a definition which is applied for purposes of
     interpreting the federal tax laws, including any statute, regulation or
     proposed regulation or any official administrative pronouncement
     (consisting of the issuance or revocation of any revenue ruling, revenue
     procedure or notice, private letter ruling, technical advice memorandum, no
     action letter, exemptive application or other administrative guidance or
     official pronouncement) or any judicial decision interpreting such federal
     tax laws or federal securities laws (whether or not such pronouncement or
     decision is issued to, or in connection with, a proceeding involving the
     Company or a Subsidiary of the Company or is subject to review or appeal).

          (h) NO ADVERSE CHANGES IN EQUITY MARKETS. There shall have not
     occurred and be continuing (i) any general suspension of trading in, or
     limitation on prices for, securities in the New York Stock Exchange for a
     period in excess of three hours (excluding suspensions in limitations
     resulting solely from physical damage or interference with such exchanges
     not related to market conditions) or (ii) any decline in the New York Stock
     Exchange composite index by an amount in excess of 25% measured from the
     close of business on the date of this Agreement.

          (i) CLOSING OF THE DISPOSITION. The Company shall have consummated the
     Disposition in a manner and for consideration consistent with SECTION 5.2
     hereof.

the Company to effect the Merger are subject to the satisfaction of, or waiver
by the Company, on or prior to the Closing Date of the following additional

     correct in all material respects, as applicable, as of such date);
     PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that if the foregoing provisions of this paragraph (a)
     shall not be satisfied, such provisions shall nevertheless be deemed to be
     satisfied so long as all failures of such representations and warranties to
     be so true and correct, taken together, would not reasonably be expected to
     have a Material Adverse Effect on Parent, and the Company shall have
     received a certificate of a duly authorized representative of Parent
     certifying to the satisfaction of the conditions set forth in this SECTION
     6.3(A).

          (b) PERFORMANCE OF OBLIGATIONS OF PARENT AND MERGER SUB. Each of

                                      A-48

     Agreement, other than SECTION 5.8.

     8.6 GOVERNING LAW. Except to the extent that rights of the stockholders of

governed by the MGCL, this Agreement shall be governed and construed in
accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware, without regard to principles
of conflicts of laws.

     8.7 SEVERABILITY. If any term or other provision of this Agreement is
invalid,
illegal or incapable of being enforced by any law or public policy, all other
terms and provisions of this Agreement shall nevertheless remain in full force

party. Upon such determination that any term or other provision is invalid,
illegal or incapable of being enforced, the parties hereto shall negotiate in
good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the
parties as closely as possible in an acceptable manner in order that the

obligations hereunder shall be assigned by any of the parties hereto, in whole
or in part (whether by operation of law or otherwise), without the prior written
consent of the other parties, and any attempt to make any such assignment
without such consent shall be null and void; PROVIDED, HOWEVER that this
Agreement may be assigned by any party to its successor in a merger, the purpose
of which is to change the state of domicile of such party. Subject to the
preceding sentence, this Agreement will be binding upon, inure to the benefit of
and be enforceable by the parties and their respective successors and assigns.

     8.9 SUBMISSION TO JURISDICTION WAIVERS. Each of Parent, Merger Sub and the
Company irrevocably agrees that any legal action or proceeding with respect to

Parent, Merger Sub and the Company hereby irrevocably submits with regard to any
such action or proceeding for itself and in respect to its property, generally
and unconditionally, to the nonexclusive jurisdiction of the aforesaid courts.
Each of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company hereby irrevocably waives, and agrees
not to assert, by way of motion, as a defense, counterclaim or otherwise, in any

                                      A-49

action or proceeding with respect to this Agreement, (a) any claim that it is
not personally subject to the jurisdiction of the above-named courts for any
reason other than the failure to serve process in accordance with applicable
law, (b) that it or its property is exempt or immune from jurisdiction of any
such court or from any legal process commenced in such courts (whether through
service of notice, attachment prior to judgment, attachment in aid of execution
of judgment, execution of judgment or otherwise), and (c) to the fullest extent
permitted by applicable law, that (i) the suit, action or proceeding in any such
court is brought in an inconvenient forum, (ii) the venue of such suit, action

                               FAIRNESS OPINION OF
               MERRILL LYNCH, PIERCE, FENNER & SMITH INCORPORATED

                                 March 29, 2001

Board of Directors
Franchise Finance Corporation of America
The Perimeter Center
17207 North Perimeter Drive
Scottsdale, Arizona 85255

Gentlemen:

     Franchise Finance Corporation of America (the "Company"), General Electric
Capital Corporation (the "Acquiror") and Galahad Acquisition Corp., an indirect
wholly owned subsidiary of the Acquiror (the "Acquisition Sub"), propose to
enter into an agreement (the "Agreement") pursuant to which the Company will be
merged with Acquisition Sub in a transaction (the "Merger") in which each
outstanding share of the Company's common stock, par value $.01 per share (the
"Shares"), will be converted into the right to receive $25.00 in cash.

     You have asked us whether, in our opinion, the proposed consideration to be
received by the holders of the Shares in the Merger is fair to such shareholders
from a financial point of view.

     In arriving at the opinion set forth below, we have, among other things:

     (1)  Reviewed certain publicly available business and financial information
          relating to the Company that we deemed to be relevant;
     (2)  Reviewed certain information, including financial forecasts, relating
          to the business, earnings, cash flow, assets and prospects of the
          Company;
     (3)  Conducted discussions with members of senior management of the Company
          concerning the matters described in clauses 1 and 2 above;
     (4)  Reviewed the market prices and valuation multiples for the Shares and
          compared them with those of certain publicly traded companies that we
          deemed to be relevant;
     (5)  Reviewed the results of operations of the Company and compared them
          with those of certain publicly traded companies that we deemed to be
          relevant;
     (6)  Compared the proposed financial terms of the Merger with the financial
          terms of certain other transactions that we deemed to be relevant;
     (7)  Participated in certain discussions and negotiations among
          representatives of the Company and the Acquiror and their financial
          and legal advisors;
     (8)  Reviewed a draft dated March 29, 2001 of the Agreement; and
     (9)  Reviewed such other financial studies and analyses and took into
          account such other matters as we deemed necessary, including our
          assessment of general economic, market and monetary conditions.

     In preparing our opinion, we have assumed and relied on the accuracy and
completeness of all information supplied or otherwise made available to us,
discussed with or reviewed for or by us, or publicly available, and we have not
assumed any responsibility for independently verifying such

                                      B-1

information or undertaken an independent evaluation or appraisal of any assets
or liabilities of the Company. We are not experts in the evaluation of
allowances for loan and lease losses, and we have neither made an independent
evaluation of the adequacy of the allowance for loan and lease losses of the
Company, nor reviewed any individual credit files relating to the Company, and,
as a result, we have assumed that the aggregate allowance for loan and lease
losses for the Company is adequate to cover such losses. In addition, we have
not assumed any obligation to conduct any physical inspection of the properties
or facilities of the Company. With respect to the financial forecast information
furnished to or discussed with us by the Company, we have assumed that they have
been reasonably prepared and reflect the best currently available estimates and
judgment of the management as to the expected future financial performance of
the Company. In addition, we have assumed that, in the course of obtaining the
necessary regulatory or other consents or approvals (contractual or otherwise)
for the Merger, no restrictions, including any divestiture requirements or
amendments or modifications, will be imposed that will have a material adverse
effect on the contemplated benefits of the Merger. We have assumed that the
Agreement will not be materially different from the last draft reviewed by us.

     Our opinion is necessarily based upon market, economic and other conditions
as they exist and can be evaluated, and on the information made available to us
as of the date hereof.

     We are acting as financial advisor to the Company in connection with the
Merger and will receive a fee from the Company for our services, a significant
portion of which is contingent upon the consummation of the Merger. In addition,
the Company has agreed to indemnify us for certain liabilities arising out of
our engagement. We have, in the past, provided financial advisory and financing
services to the Company and the Acquiror and may continue to do so and have
received, and may receive, fees for the rendering of such services. In addition,
in the ordinary course of our business, we may actively trade securities of the
Company and the Acquiror for our own account and for the accounts of customers
and, accordingly, may at any time hold a long or short position in such
securities.

     This opinion is for the use and benefit of the Board of Directors of the
Company. Our opinion does not address the merits of the underlying decision by
the Company to engage in the Merger and does not constitute a recommendation to
any shareholder as to how such shareholder should vote on the Merger.

     On the basis of, and subject to the foregoing, we are of the opinion that,
as of the date hereof, the proposed consideration to be received by the holders
of the Shares pursuant to the Merger is fair to such shareholders from a
financial point of view.

                                       Very truly yours,

                                       /s/ Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith
