Dear Shareholder:

    NOVA's board of directors has approved an agreement to merge NOVA with and
into U.S. Bancorp. Under the terms of the merger agreement, in exchange for each
NOVA share that you hold, you may elect to receive from U.S. Bancorp (1) $31.00
in cash, or (2) 1.407 shares of U.S. Bancorp common stock, or (3) a combination
of cash and U.S. Bancorp common stock, subject to certain conditions as
described in the enclosed materials. THE STOCK EXCHANGE RATIO IS FIXED, MEANING
THAT IT WILL NOT BE ADJUSTED BASED ON CHANGES IN THE PRICES OF THE NOVA AND U.S.
BANCORP COMMON STOCK PRIOR TO COMPLETION OF THE MERGER.

- - BASED ON U.S. BANCORP'S CLOSING PRICE OF $22.68 ON MAY 4, 2001, THE LAST
  TRADING DAY PRIOR TO THE DATE OF THE MERGER AGREEMENT, THE 1.407 STOCK
  EXCHANGE RATIO REPRESENTED APPROXIMATELY $31.55 IN VALUE FOR EACH SHARE OF
  NOVA COMMON STOCK.

- - BASED ON U.S. BANCORP'S CLOSING PRICE OF $22.30 ON JUNE 19, 2001, THE LAST
  PRACTICABLE DATE PRIOR TO THE DATE OF THIS PROXY STATEMENT/PROSPECTUS, THE
  1.407 STOCK EXCHANGE RATIO REPRESENTED APPROXIMATELY $31.23 IN VALUE FOR EACH
  SHARE OF NOVA COMMON STOCK.

    We urge you to obtain current market price quotations for U.S. Bancorp and
NOVA common stock. The common stock of both U.S. Bancorp and NOVA is listed on
the New York Stock Exchange. NOVA is listed under the symbol "NIS," and U.S.
Bancorp is listed under the symbol "USB."

    WE EXPECT THAT THE MERGER WILL BE A TAX-FREE TRANSACTION TO YOU TO THE
EXTENT YOU RECEIVE U.S. BANCORP COMMON STOCK IN THE MERGER BUT WILL BE TAXABLE
TO YOU TO THE EXTENT YOU RECEIVE CASH.

    Completion of the merger is subject to a number of conditions, including
approval of the merger by NOVA's shareholders. NOVA will hold a special meeting
of shareholders on July 24, 2001 to vote on the merger. We urge you to complete
the enclosed proxy card promptly as described in the enclosed materials. If you
attend the meeting, you may vote in person even if you returned your proxy card.

    You must make your election to receive cash and/or shares of U.S. Bancorp
common stock on a form of election that is being mailed to you separately. You
must comply with the election deadline and all instructions on the form of
election. Even if you meet the election deadline, you may not receive the
consideration you elected because the aggregate amount of U.S. Bancorp shares
and cash to be issued in the merger is fixed by the merger agreement, as fully
explained in the enclosed materials.

    NOVA'S BOARD OF DIRECTORS BELIEVES THE TERMS OF THE MERGER AGREEMENT AND THE
MERGER ARE FAIR TO YOU AND IN YOUR BEST INTEREST, AND RECOMMENDS THAT YOU VOTE
"FOR" APPROVAL OF THE MERGER.

                                          Sincerely,

                                          /s/ Edward Grzedzinski

    This proxy statement of NOVA is also a prospectus of U.S. Bancorp related to
U.S. Bancorp common stock to be issued in connection with the merger. This proxy
statement/prospectus is dated June 21, 2001 and is first being mailed to NOVA's
shareholders on or about June 22, 2001.

    NEITHER THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION NOR ANY STATE SECURITIES
COMMISSION HAS APPROVED OR DISAPPROVED OF THE SECURITIES TO BE ISSUED UNDER THIS
PROXY STATEMENT/PROSPECTUS OR DETERMINED IF THIS DOCUMENT IS ACCURATE OR
ADEQUATE. ANY REPRESENTATION TO THE CONTRARY IS A CRIMINAL OFFENSE.

                   NOTICE OF SPECIAL MEETING OF SHAREHOLDERS
                   TO BE HELD ON JULY 24, 2001 AT 10:00 A.M.
             AT 303 PEACHTREE STREET, SUITE 5300, ATLANTA, GEORGIA

TO THE SHAREHOLDERS OF NOVA CORPORATION:

A special meeting of shareholders will be held on July 24, 2001, at 10:00 a.m.
Eastern Daylight Time at 303 Peachtree Street, Suite 5300, Atlanta, Georgia, for
the following purposes:

    (1) To consider and vote upon a proposal to approve and adopt the terms of a
       proposed merger of NOVA with and into U.S. Bancorp as provided in the
       Agreement and Plan of Merger dated as of May 7, 2001, between NOVA and
       U.S. Bancorp and to approve the merger agreement.

    (2) To consider other business that may properly come before the special
       meeting or any adjournments or postponements of the special meeting.

    These items of business are described more fully in the proxy
statement/prospectus attached to this notice. We urge you to carefully read the
proxy statement/prospectus in its entirety. A copy of the merger agreement is
attached as Appendix A to the proxy statement/prospectus.

    You are entitled to notice of and to vote at the special meeting, and any
adjournments or postponements of the special meeting, only if you were a
shareholder of record of NOVA at the close of business on June 21, 2001, the
date that your board of directors fixed as the record date for the special
meeting. We cannot complete the merger unless holders of a majority of the
shares of NOVA common stock outstanding on the record date vote to approve the
merger agreement and the merger.

    THE NOVA BOARD OF DIRECTORS RECOMMENDS THAT SHAREHOLDERS VOTE "FOR" APPROVAL
OF THE MERGER AGREEMENT AND COMPLETION OF THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED BY THE
MERGER AGREEMENT.

    YOUR VOTE IS IMPORTANT.  Even if you plan to attend the meeting, please
complete, date and sign the enclosed proxy card. To ensure that your shares will
be represented at the special meeting, promptly return the proxy card in the
enclosed envelope, which requires no postage if mailed in the United States. If
you attend the meeting, you may vote in person even if you previously returned a
proxy card.

    A form of election is being mailed to you separately on or about the date of
mailing of this document. To elect the form of consideration you wish to receive
in the merger and to provide information needed by U.S. Bancorp to send you your
merger consideration, you must complete, sign and date the form of election and
mail it, in accordance with the instructions provided with the form of election,
to the designated exchange agent, so it is received not later than 5:00 p.m.
Eastern Daylight Time on July 24, 2001. If you hold any stock certificates
representing shares of NOVA common stock, you should submit them to the exchange
agent with the form of election. If your shares are held in book-entry form, you
need only submit the form of election, or follow any instructions provided by
your broker.

                                          By Order of the Board of Directors

                     QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS ABOUT THE MERGER

Q:  WHY IS THIS MERGER PROPOSED?

A:  NOVA is proposing this merger because its board of directors has concluded
    that the merger is in the best interests of NOVA shareholders. Based upon
    the information and analysis it received, NOVA's board believes the value to
    be received by NOVA shareholders in the merger is substantially greater than
    that available in NOVA as a continuing independent entity currently and for
    the near term, as well as in comparison with strategic alternatives. In
    addition, the combined companies can offer NOVA's customers a broader array
    of services and products than NOVA could offer on its own.

Q:  WHAT WILL I RECEIVE IN THE MERGER?

A:  Under the merger agreement, unless you perfect dissenters' appraisal rights
    as described below, you will have the right to receive at your election any
    of the following for each of your NOVA shares:

    - $31.00 in cash, without interest; or

    - 1.407 shares of U.S. Bancorp common stock; or

    - a combination of cash and U.S. Bancorp common stock, based on the exchange
      amounts listed above.

    However, under the merger agreement, the aggregate amount of cash that U.S.
    Bancorp will pay in the merger has been limited to the amount of cash that
    would be paid if 40% of the shares of NOVA common stock outstanding on the
    record date were exchanged for cash. This cash amount includes any cash paid
    to dissenters and for fractional shares. Conversely, the aggregate amount of
    common stock that U.S. Bancorp will issue in the merger is limited to 60% of
    the shares of NOVA common stock outstanding on the record date, multiplied
    by the 1.407 stock exchange ratio. Because of these limits, you may not
    receive the form of merger consideration that you elect to receive. See
    "What happens if NOVA shareholders elect to receive more cash or stock, in
    the aggregate, than the merger agreement permits?" below.

Q:  WHAT HAPPENS IF NOVA SHAREHOLDERS ELECT TO RECEIVE MORE CASH OR STOCK, IN
    THE AGGREGATE, THAN THE MERGER AGREEMENT PERMITS?

A:  As described above, the aggregate amount of cash to be paid and stock to be
    issued by U.S. Bancorp in the merger is limited. If NOVA shareholders in the
    aggregate elect to receive a percentage of either stock or cash that is
    higher than the limits provided in the agreement, then the amount of stock
    and/or cash that you elected to receive will be adjusted proportionately so
    that these limitations are met. We will attempt to honor your election, and
    NOVA shares for which no shareholder election has been made will be
    allocated cash or stock in the merger in such a manner as to attempt to meet
    these limitations. However, if there are insufficient "no-election" shares,
    it will be necessary to adjust NOVA shareholder elections in some respect.

Q:  WHAT HAPPENS WHEN THE MARKET PRICE OF U.S. BANCORP COMMON STOCK FLUCTUATES?

A:  The market price of U.S. Bancorp common stock will fluctuate before and
    after the merger is completed. However, the number of shares of U.S. Bancorp
    common stock that a NOVA shareholder will receive, either due to the
    shareholder's election or to the possible adjustments described above, is
    fixed at 1.407 U.S. Bancorp shares per NOVA share and will not be affected
    by any market price fluctuations. As a result, increases or decreases in the
    U.S. Bancorp share price will affect the value of any stock received in the
    merger but not the number of shares of stock received in the merger, and the
    U.S. Bancorp common stock to be issued per NOVA share may have a market
    value that is more or less than the $31.00 in cash to be issued per NOVA
    share. For example, between the last trading day prior to the date of the
    merger agreement and June 19, 2001, the dollar value of the per share
    consideration to NOVA shareholders in the merger, based on the closing price
    of U.S. Bancorp common stock on the New York Stock Exchange, ranged from
    $31.55 to $31.23. (The value of a NOVA share

    exchanged solely for U.S. Bancorp common stock in the same period, also
    based on the closing price of U.S. Bancorp common stock on the New York
    Stock Exchange, would have ranged from $31.91 to $31.38.) As described
    above, you may be required to accept some cash and some stock in the merger,
    regardless of your election, due to limitations imposed by the merger
    agreement.

    You can obtain current market prices for shares of U.S. Bancorp common stock
    as reported on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol "USB." On
    June 19, 2001, the closing sales price of U.S. Bancorp common stock on the
    New York Stock Exchange was $22.30.

Q:  WHEN AND WHERE WILL THE SPECIAL MEETING TAKE PLACE?

A:  The special meeting is scheduled to take place on July 24, 2001, at
    10:00 a.m. Eastern Daylight Time at 303 Peachtree Street, Suite 5300,
    Atlanta, Georgia.

Q:  HOW DO I VOTE?

A:  Simply indicate on the enclosed proxy card how you want to vote and then
    sign, date and mail your proxy card in the enclosed envelope as soon as
    possible so that your shares may be represented at the NOVA special meeting.

Q:  IF MY SHARES ARE HELD IN "STREET NAME" BY MY BROKER, WILL MY BROKER VOTE MY
    SHARES FOR ME?

A:  Your broker will not vote your shares for you unless you provide
    instructions to your broker on how to vote. Consequently, it is important
    that you follow the directions provided by your broker regarding how to
    instruct your broker to vote your shares. If you fail to instruct your
    broker on how to vote your shares, the effect will be the same as a vote
    against the merger agreement.

Q:  CAN I CHANGE MY VOTE AFTER I HAVE MAILED MY SIGNED PROXY CARD?

A:  Yes. You may change your vote at any time before your proxy is voted at the
    special meeting. If your shares are held in your own name, you may change
    your vote in one of three ways:

    - You may send a written notice stating that you would like to revoke your
      proxy and providing new instructions on how to vote.

    - You may complete and submit a new proxy card.

    - You may attend the meeting and vote in person. Simply attending the NOVA
      special meeting, however, will not revoke your proxy. If you intend to
      vote in person, and your shares are held by a broker in "street name," you
      should contact your broker for instructions.

    If you choose either the first or second method listed above, you must
    submit your notice of revocation or your new proxy card to NOVA's secretary
    prior to the special meeting.

    If your shares are held in "street name" by a broker and you have instructed
    a broker to vote your shares, you must follow directions received from your
    broker to change your vote.

Q:  DO I HAVE DISSENTERS' APPRAISAL RIGHTS?

A:  Yes. You have the right to dissent from the merger and receive a cash
    payment for your shares of NOVA common stock. To dissent from the merger,
    you must follow the procedures described under "DISSENTERS' APPRAISAL
    RIGHTS" on page 70 of the proxy statement/prospectus.

Q:  HOW DO I MAKE AN ELECTION?

A:  Simply complete, date and sign the form of election that is being mailed to
    you separately, and submit the form of election as instructed on the form,
    along with any stock certificates you hold representing all of the shares of
    common stock you hold in

    NOVA (and when necessary, by completing the notice of guaranteed delivery,
    as directed in the form of election). If your shares are held in book-entry
    form, you need only submit the form of election, or follow any instructions
    provided by your broker.

Q:  WHAT IS THE DEADLINE FOR COMPLETING MY ELECTION?

A.  The form of election must be RECEIVED by the exchange agent, Firstar Bank,
    N.A., no later than 5:00 p.m. Eastern Daylight Time on July 24, 2001.

Q.  MAY I CHANGE MY ELECTION ONCE IT HAS BEEN SUBMITTED?

A.  Yes. You may change your election so long as your new election is received
    by the exchange agent prior to 5:00 p.m. on July 24, 2001. To change your
    election, you must send the exchange agent a written notice revoking any
    election previously submitted and providing your new election information.

Q:  WHAT HAPPENS IF I FORGET TO MAKE AN ELECTION PRIOR TO THE DEADLINE?

A:  If the exchange agent has not received a form of election from you prior to
    5:00 p.m. on July 24, 2001, then U.S. Bancorp will have discretion to
    determine whether to issue you cash, shares of U.S. Bancorp common stock or
    a combination of cash and stock, in accordance with the allocation
    limitations for cash and stock.

Q:  IF I HOLD STOCK CERTIFICATES REPRESENTING MY SHARES OF NOVA, SHOULD I SEND
    IN MY CERTIFICATES NOW?

A:  Yes. Instructions for transmitting any stock certificates you hold are
    enclosed with the form of election that is being mailed to you separately.
    You should submit your stock certificates to the exchange agent at the time
    you submit the form of election.

Q:  HOW DO I EXCHANGE MY NOVA SHARES IF I DON'T HAVE A STOCK CERTIFICATE?

A:  There are generally three reasons why you might not have a certificate for
    your shares of NOVA common stock:

    - Your shares are held by a bank or by a broker in "street name." If this is
      the case, then you must contact the bank or broker for instructions on how
      to handle your account. You should do so quickly to ensure that you can
      meet the deadline for submitting a valid form of election.

    - Your shares are uncertificated because they are registered in "book-entry"
      form. If this is the case and your shares are not held by a broker, then
      you must follow the instructions on the form of election to allow the
      exchange agent to transfer your shares electronically.

    - Your stock certificates have been lost, stolen or destroyed. If this is
      the case, then you will need to follow the procedures described in the
      form of election.

Q:  CAN I MAKE AN ELECTION IF I BUY MY SHARES AFTER THE RECORD DATE?

A:  Yes. You should contact the exchange agent to request a form of election,
    which must be completed and received by the exchange agent prior to the
    election deadline. You may request a form of election by calling the
    exchange agent, Firstar Bank, N.A., at (800) 637-7549.

Q:  HOW SOON AFTER THE MERGER IS COMPLETED CAN I EXPECT TO RECEIVE CASH OR U.S.
    BANCORP COMMON STOCK?

A:  U.S. Bancorp will work with the exchange agent to distribute the merger
    consideration as promptly as practicable following the completion of the
    merger to the shareholders of NOVA who submitted the form of election prior
    to the election deadline. Other shareholders will receive merger
    consideration only when they have completed the procedures and documentation
    described under "THE

    MERGER--Election Procedures; Exchange Agent" on page 33 of the proxy
    statement/ prospectus.

Q:  WHAT ARE THE TAX CONSEQUENCES OF THE MERGER TO ME?

A:  We expect that for United States federal income tax purposes, the exchange
    of shares of NOVA common stock solely for shares of U.S. Bancorp common
    stock generally will not cause you to recognize any gain or loss. We also
    expect, for United States federal income tax purposes, that upon the
    exchange of shares of NOVA common stock for a combination of cash and shares
    of U.S. Bancorp common stock, you will be required to recognize any gain
    realized upon the exchange to the extent of the lesser of (a) the amount of
    gain realized and (b) the amount of cash received, and you will not be
    permitted to recognize any loss realized on that exchange. If you receive
    solely cash in the merger, you will recognize any gain or loss realized.

    TAX MATTERS ARE VERY COMPLICATED AND THE TAX CONSEQUENCES OF THE MERGER TO
    YOU WILL DEPEND ON YOUR PARTICULAR FACTS AND CIRCUM-STANCES. WE URGE YOU TO
    CONSULT YOUR TAX ADVISOR TO FULLY UNDERSTAND THE TAX CONSEQUENCES OF THE
    MERGER TO YOU.

Q:  WHEN DO YOU EXPECT THIS MERGER TO BE COMPLETED?

A:  We are currently working to complete this merger in the third quarter of
    2001.

Q:  CAN I TRADE MY SHARES AFTER I HAVE MADE AN ELECTION?

A:  No. Because making an election requires that you surrender your shares
    (either by submitting your stock certificates by mail, by transmitting your
    shares electronically through a book-entry transfer or by contacting your
    bank or broker, if your shares are held by a bank or by a broker in "street
    name"), you will be unable to trade your shares.

Q:  WHO CAN HELP ME ANSWER MY QUESTIONS?

A:  If you have additional questions about the merger or the special meeting
    that are not answered in this proxy statement/prospectus, you should
    contact:

    NOVA Corporation

    THIS SUMMARY HIGHLIGHTS SELECTED INFORMATION FROM THE PROXY
STATEMENT/PROSPECTUS. IT MAY NOT CONTAIN ALL OF THE INFORMATION THAT IS
IMPORTANT TO YOU. FOR A MORE COMPLETE UNDERSTANDING OF THE MERGER, WE URGE YOU
TO READ CAREFULLY THE ENTIRE PROXY STATEMENT/PROSPECTUS AND THE OTHER DOCUMENTS
TO WHICH THIS PROXY STATEMENT/PROSPECTUS REFERS. SEE "WHERE YOU CAN FIND MORE
INFORMATION." EACH ITEM IN THIS SUMMARY INCLUDES A PAGE REFERENCE IN THE PROXY
STATEMENT/PROSPECTUS DIRECTING YOU TO A MORE DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THAT ITEM.

WE PROPOSE A MERGER OF NOVA AND U.S. BANCORP (PAGE 20)

    We propose a combination in which NOVA will merge with and into U.S.
Bancorp. In the merger, your shares of NOVA common stock will be exchanged for
cash, shares of U.S. Bancorp common stock or a combination of the two. After the
merger, you will no longer own shares of NOVA. Subject to obtaining required
approvals, we expect to complete the merger in the third quarter of 2001.

WHAT NOVA SHAREHOLDERS WILL RECEIVE IN THE MERGER (PAGE 31)

    You can elect to receive cash, U.S. Bancorp common stock, or a combination
of the two, as described in "What will I receive in the merger?" in the
Questions and Answers section above.

    If you fail to make a proper or timely election to receive either cash or
shares of U.S. Bancorp common stock for any of your NOVA shares, you will be
deemed to have indicated no preference as to the receipt of cash or shares of
U.S. Bancorp common stock and will receive cash and/or shares of U.S. Bancorp
common stock at the discretion of U.S. Bancorp, subject to the allocation
limitations. We will attempt to honor your election, and NOVA shares for which
no shareholder election has been made will be allocated cash or stock in such a
manner as to attempt to accommodate NOVA shareholder elections while still
meeting the allocation limitations. However, if there are insufficient
"no-election" shares, it will be necessary to adjust NOVA shareholder elections
in some respect.

MARKET PRICE INFORMATION (PAGES 12 AND 54)

    Shares of U.S. Bancorp common stock and shares of NOVA common stock are both
listed on the New York Stock Exchange. On May 4, 2001, the last trading day
before we announced the merger, U.S. Bancorp common stock closed at $22.68 per
share, and NOVA common stock closed at $23.52 per share. On June 19, 2001, the
last practicable date before the date of this proxy statement/prospectus, U.S.
Bancorp common stock closed at $22.30 per share and NOVA common stock closed at
$30.70 per share.

    Based on U.S. Bancorp's closing price of $22.68 on May 4, 2001, the last
trading day prior to the date of the merger agreement, the 1.407 stock exchange
ratio represented approximately $31.55 in value for each share of NOVA common
stock. Based on U.S. Bancorp's closing stock price of $22.30 on June 19, 2001,
the last practicable date prior to the date of this proxy statement/prospectus,
the 1.407 stock exchange ratio represented approximately $31.23 in value for
each share of NOVA common stock. Of course, the market price of U.S. Bancorp
common stock will fluctuate prior to and after the merger.

THE MERGER GENERALLY WILL BE TAX-FREE TO NOVA SHAREHOLDERS TO THE EXTENT THEY
RECEIVE SOLELY U.S. BANCORP COMMON STOCK AND TAXABLE TO THE EXTENT THEY RECEIVE
ANY CASH (PAGE 35)

    See "What are the tax consequences of the merger to me?" in the Questions
and Answers section above.

    DETERMINING THE ACTUAL TAX CONSEQUENCES OF THE MERGER TO YOU MAY BE
COMPLICATED. THEY WILL DEPEND ON YOUR SPECIFIC SITUATION AND ON PARTICULAR FACTS
AND CIRCUMSTANCES NOT WITHIN OUR CONTROL. IN ADDITION, CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES MAY
OCCUR THAT WOULD RESULT IN ALL OF THE MERGER CONSIDERATION BEING TAXABLE. SEE
"THE MERGER--MATERIAL FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSEQUENCES." YOU SHOULD CONSULT YOUR
OWN TAX ADVISOR FOR A FULL UNDERSTANDING OF THE MERGER'S TAX CONSEQUENCES TO
YOU.

YOU HAVE THE RIGHT TO DISSENT (PAGE 70)

    Holders of NOVA common stock who do not vote in favor of the merger and who
have fully complied with all applicable provisions of the Georgia Business
Corporation Code may have the right to require U.S. Bancorp to purchase the
shares of NOVA common stock held by them for cash at the fair market value of
those shares immediately before the merger. Georgia law does not treat any
appreciation or depreciation in anticipation of the merger as affecting fair
market value of the dissenting shares on the valuation date. The value of the
dissenting shares, determined in accordance with the Georgia Business
Corporation Code, may be more or less than the value of the shares of U.S.
Bancorp common stock to be received in connection with the merger. Appendix C
contains a copy of the relevant provisions of the Georgia Business Corporation
Code.

NOVA'S FINANCIAL ADVISOR SAYS THE MERGER CONSIDERATION IS FAIR TO NOVA
SHAREHOLDERS FROM A FINANCIAL POINT OF VIEW (PAGE 23)

    Salomon Smith Barney has acted as a financial advisor to NOVA's board of
directors in connection with the merger and has delivered to NOVA's board its
written opinion that, as of May 6, 2001, based upon and subject to various
qualifications and assumptions described in its opinion, the consideration to be
received by the NOVA shareholders pursuant to the merger was fair to the NOVA
shareholders from a financial point of view. We have attached the full text of
the opinion to this proxy statement/prospectus as Appendix B. You should read it
completely to understand the assumptions made, matters considered and the
limitations of the review made by Salomon Smith Barney in providing its opinion.
NOVA has agreed to pay Salomon Smith Barney a cash fee equal to 0.55% of the
transaction value for its services rendered in connection with the merger, of
which $1 million is payable upon delivery of the opinion and the balance is
payable upon consummation of the merger. NOVA also has agreed to indemnify
Salomon Smith Barney for any liabilities assumed related to its engagement and
reimburse it for any out-of-pocket expenses, including those associated with the
retention of legal counsel.

NOVA'S REASONS FOR THE MERGER (PAGE 21)

    After reviewing the proposed merger and evaluating NOVA's operations and
prospects and those of U.S. Bancorp with its financial and legal advisors,
NOVA's board of directors believes that the merger is in the best interest of
NOVA and of its shareholders and customers. In reaching its decision to approve
the merger, NOVA's board of directors analyzed:

- - the terms of the merger;

- - the value to be received by NOVA shareholders in the merger as compared to
  that available in NOVA as a continuing independent entity currently and for
  the near term;

- - the range of possible values to NOVA shareholders obtainable through strategic
  alternatives and the likelihood and risks of the same; and

- - the history of U.S. Bancorp and the prospects of U.S. Bancorp if the merger
  were to be completed.

U.S. BANCORP'S REASONS FOR THE MERGER (PAGE 21)

    U.S. Bancorp believes that the merger will provide U.S. Bancorp with an
attractive opportunity to expand its merchant processing business, particularly
to small to medium-sized customers. U.S. Bancorp believes that NOVA's locations
and business mix complement U.S. Bancorp's current merchant processing
operations, and that the merger will enable U.S. Bancorp to offer, through NOVA,
a broad array of merchant processing products and services to a larger market.

NOVA RECOMMENDS THAT YOU VOTE FOR THE MERGER (PAGE 21)

    NOVA's board of directors believes that the merger is fair to you and in
your best interests, and unanimously recommends that you vote "FOR" the proposal
to approve the merger.

NOVA IS HOLDING A SPECIAL MEETING TO VOTE ON THE MERGER (PAGE 17 )

    The special meeting of shareholders of NOVA will be held on July 24, 2001,
at

10:00 a.m., Eastern Daylight Time, at 303 Peachtree Street, Suite 5300, Atlanta,
Georgia. At the special meeting, shareholders of NOVA will be asked:

- - to consider and vote on a proposal to approve the merger agreement and the
  merger of NOVA with U.S. Bancorp; and

- - to consider and transact other business that may properly come before the
  special meeting and at any adjournments or postponements of the meeting.

MERGER APPROVAL REQUIRES A MAJORITY VOTE BY NOVA SHAREHOLDERS OF RECORD AS OF
JUNE 21, 2001 (PAGE 17)

    NOVA's board has set June 21, 2001 as the record date for the special
meeting. You can vote at the special meeting if you owned NOVA common stock at
the close of business on the record date. You can cast one vote for each share
of NOVA common stock you owned at that time. Approval of the merger by NOVA's
shareholders requires the favorable vote of at least the majority of the shares
of NOVA outstanding on the record date.

    NOVA's directors and executive officers hold about 2.21% of the outstanding
shares of NOVA common stock entitled to vote at the special meeting. We expect
NOVA's directors and officers to vote their shares for approval of the merger
agreement.

    If you are the registered owner of your shares, you may vote them in person
by attending the special meeting or by mailing us your proxy if you are unable
or do not wish to attend. If your shares are deposited with a broker, the broker
will advise you about the special meeting and will explain how you can instruct
the broker to vote your shares (usually by signing and returning your proxy card
to the broker). You can revoke your proxy at any time before the special meeting
by sending a written notice revoking the proxy or a later-dated proxy to NOVA's
secretary, or by attending the special meeting and revoking your proxy at that
time and voting in person.

NOVA'S OFFICERS MAY HAVE INTERESTS IN THE MERGER THAT DIFFER FROM YOUR INTERESTS
(PAGE 41)

    The interests of some of NOVA's executive officers are somewhat different
from and in addition to their interests as shareholders generally because the
terms of their agreements and arrangements with NOVA or U.S. Bancorp give them
additional benefits in connection with the merger. These agreements and
arrangements include employment agreements with change in control agreements.

    Also, following the merger, U.S. Bancorp will purchase directors' and
officers' insurance for the directors and officers of NOVA and will indemnify
directors and officers of NOVA for events occurring before the merger, including
events that are related to the merger agreement. This indemnity and insurance
will be in addition to the indemnification and insurance to which those officers
and directors of NOVA who become officers and directors of U.S. Bancorp
following the completion of the merger will be entitled while acting in that
capacity at and after the merger.

    NOVA's board of directors knew about the proposed interests of these
executive officers and considered them when it approved the merger agreement and
the merger.

WE MUST MEET A NUMBER OF CONDITIONS TO COMPLETE THE MERGER (PAGE 44)

    The completion of the merger depends on a number of conditions being met.
These include, among other conditions:

- - the approval of the merger and the merger agreement by shareholders holding a
  majority of NOVA's shares;

- - the approval of the merger by the necessary federal and state regulatory
  authorities;

- - the receipt of all permits and authorizations under applicable state
  securities laws necessary to issue U.S. Bancorp common stock in the merger;

- - the approval by the New York Stock Exchange of the listing of any newly issued
  shares of U.S. Bancorp common stock to be issued in the merger;

- - the absence of any order, injunction, decree, law or regulation that would
  prohibit the merger;

- - the total number of shares of NOVA common stock held by NOVA shareholders who
  have indicated their intent to exercise dissenters' rights under the Georgia
  Business Corporation Code must not exceed 40% of the shares of NOVA common
  stock outstanding as of the date of the special meeting; and

- -the receipt by each of NOVA and U.S. Bancorp of legal opinions that the merger
 will qualify as a "reorganization" within Section 368(a) of the Internal
 Revenue Code of 1986, as amended.

 If the value of U.S. Bancorp common stock decreases so that, based on the
 closing price on the last trading day prior to the date the merger would be
 completed, the value of U.S. Bancorp common stock to be issued to NOVA
 shareholders no longer equals or exceeds 50% of the total merger consideration
 to be issued

 to NOVA shareholders, U.S. Bancorp may either increase the number of shares of
 U.S. Bancorp common stock to be issued on a proportionate basis or increase the
 number of shares of NOVA common stock to be converted into shares of U.S.
 Bancorp common stock (and decrease the number of shares of NOVA common stock to
 be converted into cash) so that the value of U.S. Bancorp common stock to be
 issued to NOVA shareholders still equals or exceeds 50% of the total merger
 consideration. If U.S. Bancorp does not take either of these actions, then the
 receipt by each of NOVA and U.S. Bancorp of legal opinions that the merger will
 qualify as a reorganization under Section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code
 will no longer be a condition to the completion of the merger. However, if the
 average of the daily closing prices of a share of U.S. Bancorp common stock (as
 reported on the consolidated tape of the New York Stock Exchange) during any
 period of 10 consecutive trading days after the date of the agreement is less
 than $15.50, NOVA may terminate the merger agreement unless U.S. Bancorp agrees
 to adjust the exchange ratio in such a manner as to provide NOVA's shareholders
 with a stock consideration per share of NOVA common stock with a value greater
 than or equal to $21.80, which represents total merger consideration--cash and
 stock--per share of NOVA common stock with a value greater than or equal to
 approximately $25.485; in this event, U.S. Bancorp may not eliminate the
 delivery of tax opinions as a condition to closing.

    Where the law permits, either NOVA or U.S. Bancorp could choose to waive a
condition to its obligation to complete the merger even when that condition has
not been satisfied. We cannot be certain when, or if, the conditions to the
merger will be satisfied or waived, or that the merger will be completed.

WE MUST OBTAIN ANTITRUST APPROVAL TO COMPLETE THE MERGER (PAGE 46)

    The merger is subject to U.S. antitrust laws. We have made the required
filings with the U.S. Department of Justice and the Federal Trade Commission.
However, we are not permitted to complete the merger until the applicable
waiting period has expired or been terminated. The applicable waiting period
will expire at 11:59 p.m. on July 11, 2001 unless extended by a second request
for information. The Department of Justice or the Federal Trade Commission, as
well as a state or private person, may challenge the merger at any time before
or after its completion.

WE CAN TERMINATE THE MERGER AGREEMENT UNDER CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES (PAGE 50)

    NOVA and U.S. Bancorp can mutually agree at any time to terminate the merger
agreement without completing the merger, even if NOVA's shareholders have
approved it. Also, either U.S. Bancorp or NOVA can terminate the merger
agreement if:

- - the other party breaches the merger agreement in any material respect, and the
  breaching party does not correct the breach within 45 days following receipt
  of notice of the breach;

- - the merger has not been completed by December 31, 2001, unless the failure to
  complete the merger by that time is due to a violation of the merger agreement
  by the party that wants to terminate the merger agreement;

- - any government agency denies an approval needed to complete the merger, and
  that denial has become final and nonappealable;

- - NOVA does not obtain shareholder approval; or

- - a condition in the merger agreement becomes impossible to satisfy.

    In addition, U.S. Bancorp may terminate the merger agreement if NOVA's board
of directors withdraws, changes or modifies, in some way adverse to U.S.
Bancorp, its recommendation to the NOVA shareholders to approve the merger prior
to the special meeting or if the special meeting is not called and held. U.S.
Bancorp also may terminate the merger agreement if NOVA's board of directors
recommends or approves a takeover proposal, as defined in the merger agreement,
with another party or NOVA enters into an agreement regarding a takeover
proposal with another party.

    NOVA may also terminate the merger agreement if the average daily closing
price per share of U.S. Bancorp common stock as quoted on the New York Stock
Exchange during any period of 10 consecutive trading days after May 7, 2001 is
less than $15.50, unless U.S. Bancorp agrees to adjust the exchange ratio so as
to provide the NOVA shareholders with a stock consideration per share of NOVA
common stock with a value greater than or equal to $21.80, which represents
total merger consideration--cash and stock--per share of NOVA common stock with
a value greater than or equal to approximately $25.485.

    NOVA also may terminate the merger agreement if it enters into an agreement
regarding a takeover proposal that is superior from a financial standpoint and
it pays U.S. Bancorp the termination fee that is discussed below.

IF WE TERMINATE THE MERGER AGREEMENT UNDER CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES, NOVA MUST PAY
U.S. BANCORP $65 MILLION (PAGE 51)

    If the merger agreement is terminated and the merger abandoned under certain
circumstances, NOVA will pay to U.S. Bancorp $65 million as a termination fee.
NOVA would only be required to pay this fee if the merger agreement is
terminated upon the occurrence of any of the following events and conditions:

- - by NOVA or U.S. Bancorp because NOVA enters into any agreement regarding a
  takeover proposal with another party;

- - by U.S. Bancorp because NOVA's board fails to recommend the merger to its
  shareholders, or withdraws, modifies or changes its recommendation in a manner
  adverse to the interests of U.S. Bancorp, or recommends or approves a takeover
  proposal with another party, and NOVA subsequently enters into an agreement
  providing for a takeover proposal;

- - by U.S. Bancorp or NOVA because the other has materially breached any of its
  representations and warranties or has failed to perform in any material
  respect any of its covenants, and the breach has not been cured within
  45 days following receipt of notice of the breach, and if a takeover proposal
  prior to such termination is publicly announced and NOVA completes a takeover
  proposal or enters into an agreement for a takeover proposal within 18 months
  after the date of such termination; or

- - by U.S. Bancorp or NOVA if NOVA's shareholders do not approve the merger, and
  if a takeover proposal prior to such termination is publicly announced and
  NOVA completes a takeover proposal or enters into an agreement for a takeover
  proposal within 18 months after the date of such termination.

IF WE FAIL TO COMPLETE THE MERGER, UNDER CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES U.S. BANCORP
MAY PURCHASE NOVA'S INTEREST IN A JOINT VENTURE WITH U.S. BANCORP (PAGE 52)

    In 1998, NOVA established a joint venture with a subsidiary of Firstar
Corporation, the predecessor to U.S. Bancorp. As a condition to execution of the
merger agreement, NOVA and U.S. Bancorp entered into an LLC Buyout Agreement,
under which NOVA and U.S. Bancorp agreed that if the merger agreement is
terminated under certain circumstances, and NOVA subsequently consummates a
takeover proposal with a party other than U.S. Bancorp, then NOVA will transfer
its interest in the joint venture to U.S. Bancorp upon U.S. Bancorp's payment to
NOVA of $47,585,000 and each of NOVA and U.S. Bancorp will release the other
from any claims arising from the joint venture arrangement, with certain limited
exceptions, prior to the closing of the transfer of the interest.

WE MAY AMEND OR WAIVE TERMS OF THE MERGER AGREEMENT (PAGE 52)

    NOVA and U.S. Bancorp may jointly amend the merger agreement. In addition,
either of us may waive our right to require the other party to adhere to the
terms and conditions of the merger agreement. However, NOVA and U.S. Bancorp may
not amend the merger agreement after NOVA's shareholders approve the merger if
the amendment (1) reduces or changes the form of consideration that will be
received by NOVA's shareholders or (2) violates the Georgia Business Corporation
Code.

NOVA SHAREHOLDERS WHO RECEIVE U.S. BANCORP COMMON STOCK WILL HAVE THE RIGHTS OF
OTHER U.S. BANCORP SHAREHOLDERS (PAGES 57 AND 59)

    The rights of U.S. Bancorp shareholders are governed by Delaware law and
U.S. Bancorp's certificate of incorporation and bylaws. The rights of NOVA
shareholders are governed by Georgia law and NOVA's articles of incorporation
and bylaws. Upon our completing the merger, NOVA shareholders who receive shares
of U.S. Bancorp common stock in the merger will become shareholders of U.S.
Bancorp, and the rights of these NOVA shareholders will be governed by Delaware
law and by U.S. Bancorp's certificate of incorporation and bylaws.

WE EXPECT TO ACCOUNT FOR THE MERGER USING THE PURCHASE METHOD OF ACCOUNTING
(PAGE 40)

    U.S. Bancorp expects to account for the merger using the purchase method of
accounting under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.

NOVA STOCK OPTIONS WILL BECOME U.S. BANCORP STOCK OPTIONS (PAGE 35)

    In the merger, each option to buy shares of NOVA common stock granted under
NOVA's stock option plans will be converted into an option to purchase shares of
U.S. Bancorp common stock equal to the number of shares of NOVA common stock
subject to the option, multiplied by 1.407. The exercise price for these U.S.
Bancorp options will equal the exercise price per share for the NOVA common
stock subject to the former NOVA stock option divided by 1.407.

COMPARATIVE PER SHARE MARKET PRICE INFORMATION

    Shares of U.S. Bancorp and NOVA common stock are listed on the New York
Stock Exchange. The following table sets forth the closing price per share of
U.S. Bancorp common stock and NOVA common stock and the "equivalent per share
price" (as explained below) of NOVA common stock as of May 4, 2001, the last
trading day before the date on which U.S. Bancorp and NOVA announced the merger,
and as of June 19, 2001, the last practicable date prior to the date of this
proxy statement/ prospectus. The "equivalent per share price" of NOVA common
stock on any date equals the closing price of U.S. Bancorp common stock on that
date multiplied by the exchange ratio of 1.407 shares of U.S. Bancorp common
stock for each share of NOVA common stock.

    Of course, the market price of U.S. Bancorp common stock and NOVA common
stock will fluctuate prior to the merger. Therefore, you are encouraged to
obtain current stock price quotations for U.S. Bancorp common stock and NOVA
common stock prior to voting on the merger and submitting your form of election.

                    THE SPECIAL MEETING OF NOVA SHAREHOLDERS

    THIS SECTION OF THE PROXY STATEMENT/PROSPECTUS CONTAINS INFORMATION ABOUT
THE SPECIAL MEETING OF SHAREHOLDERS NOVA HAS CALLED TO CONSIDER AND APPROVE THE
MERGER AGREEMENT. ENCLOSED WITH THIS PROXY STATEMENT/PROSPECTUS ARE A NOTICE OF
THE SPECIAL MEETING AND A FORM OF PROXY THAT NOVA'S BOARD IS SOLICITING FOR USE
AT THE SPECIAL MEETING. A FORM OF ELECTION FOR DESIGNATING THE TYPE OF MERGER
CONSIDERATION YOU WISH TO RECEIVE IN THE MERGER IS BEING MAILED TO YOU
SEPARATELY. WE ARE MAILING THESE DOCUMENTS TO YOU ON OR ABOUT JUNE 22, 2001.

DATE, TIME AND PLACE OF THE SPECIAL MEETING.

    The special meeting will be held on July 24, 2001, beginning at 10:00 a.m.
Eastern Daylight Time, at 303 Peachtree Street, Suite 5300, Atlanta, Georgia.

MATTERS TO BE CONSIDERED

    The purpose of the special meeting is to vote on the approval of the merger
agreement and the merger of NOVA into U.S. Bancorp. You may also be asked to
vote on other business as may properly come before the special meeting or on a
proposal to adjourn or postpone the special meeting. We could use any
adjournment or postponement of the special meeting for the purpose of allowing
more time to solicit votes to approve the merger agreement or for other
purposes.

RECORD DATE AND SHARES ENTITLED TO VOTE

    NOVA's board of directors has fixed the close of business on June 21, 2001
as the record date for the special meeting. Only shareholders of record of
common stock, $0.01 par value per share, of NOVA on the books of NOVA as of the
close of business on the record date will be entitled to notice of and to vote
at the special meeting and any postponements or adjournments of the special
meeting. At the close of business on the record date, there were 66,904,000
shares of NOVA common stock outstanding and entitled to vote, held by
approximately 119 shareholders of record. Each NOVA shareholder will be entitled
to one vote for each share of NOVA common stock held in the shareholder's name,
on the books of NOVA, as of the record date.

VOTE REQUIRED

    Under the Georgia Business Corporation Code, approval of the merger and the
merger agreement requires the affirmative vote, in person or by proxy, of the
holders of a majority of the shares of NOVA common stock outstanding and
entitled to vote at the special meeting. As of the record date, NOVA's directors
and executive officers beneficially owned approximately 1,479,450 shares of NOVA
common stock, entitling them to exercise approximately 2.21% of the voting power
of the NOVA common stock entitled to vote at the special meeting. We currently
expect that each of NOVA's directors and executive officers will vote the shares
of NOVA common stock he or she beneficially owns "FOR" approval of the merger
agreement and the consummation of the merger.

    You can find additional information about beneficial ownership of NOVA
common stock by persons and entities, if any, owning more than 5% of the NOVA
common stock, and more detailed information about beneficial ownership of NOVA
common stock by its directors and executive officers, in the definitive proxy
statement NOVA filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission and sent to its
shareholders in connection with its 2001 annual meeting of shareholders. See
"WHERE YOU CAN FIND MORE INFORMATION" for instructions on how you can obtain
this document.

VOTING OF PROXIES; REVOCATION OF PROXIES

    You are requested to complete, date and sign the enclosed proxy card and
promptly return it in the enclosed envelope, which requires no postage if mailed
in the United States. If your shares are held in "street name" by your broker,
your broker will vote your shares for you only if you provide instructions on
how to vote. Your broker will provide you with directions regarding how to
instruct your broker to vote your shares.

    Shares of NOVA common stock represented by proxies properly executed and
received by NOVA in time to be voted at the special meeting and that are not
revoked will be voted in accordance with the instructions indicated on the
proxies or, if no instructions are indicated, will be voted "FOR" the approval
of the terms of the merger and the merger agreement. NOVA's board of directors
is not currently aware of any business to be acted upon at the special meeting
other than as described in this proxy statement/prospectus. However, if other
matters are properly brought before the special meeting (including, among other
things, consideration of a motion to adjourn the special meeting to another time
or place for the purpose of soliciting additional proxies or otherwise), persons
appointed as proxies will have discretion to vote on the matters in their best
judgment.

    You may revoke a proxy at any time prior to its exercise by:

    - delivery of a written notice of revocation to NOVA's secretary prior to
      the special meeting;

    - delivery of a duly executed proxy bearing a later date to NOVA's secretary
      prior to the special meeting; or

    - attending the special meeting and revoking the proxy and voting in person
      at that time.

Your presence at the special meeting (or at any adjournment or postponement)
will not automatically revoke your proxy.

    Written notices of proxy revocation and other communications about revoking
your proxy should be addressed to Secretary, NOVA Corporation, One Concourse
Parkway, Suite 300, Atlanta, Georgia 30328.

QUORUM; ABSTENTIONS AND BROKER NON-VOTES

    The required quorum for the transaction of business at the special meeting
is a majority of all shares of NOVA common stock outstanding and entitled to
vote at the special meeting. Abstentions will be included in determining the
number of shares present and voting at the meeting for determining the presence
of a quorum. Because approval of the merger agreement and the consummation of
the merger requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the outstanding shares
of NOVA common stock entitled to vote, abstentions will have the same effect as
votes against the merger and the merger agreement. In addition, a failure of a
NOVA shareholder to return a proxy will have the effect of a vote against the
adoption of the merger agreement and the merger.

    Under the rules of the New York Stock Exchange, brokers who hold shares in
"street name" for customers have the authority to vote on "routine" proposals
when they have not received instructions from beneficial owners. However, these
brokers are precluded from exercising their voting discretion with respect to
the approval and adoption of non-routine matters like the merger agreement
proposal. Consequently, if your shares of NOVA common stock are held by a broker
in street name and you fail to provide the broker with specific instructions on
how to vote your shares, the broker cannot vote your shares with respect to the
approval and adoption of the merger proposal. Because the affirmative vote
described above is required for approval of the merger proposal, a "non-vote" by
a broker who has not received specific voting instructions from you with respect
to the merger proposal will have the same effect as a vote against the proposal.
Broker non-votes will be included in determining the number of shares present
and voting at the meeting for determining the presence of a quorum. You may
instruct

your broker how to vote on the merger proposal by completing the enclosed proxy
card and returning it to your broker in accordance with the instructions your
broker has provided you. WE URGE YOU TO PROVIDE YOUR BROKER WITH VOTING
INSTRUCTIONS BY RETURNING THE ENCLOSED PROXY CARD TO YOUR BROKER AS DIRECTED BY
YOUR BROKER.

SOLICITATION OF PROXIES; EXPENSES OF SOLICITATION

    In addition to soliciting proxies through the mail, NOVA may solicit proxies
through its directors, officers and employees in person and by telephone, or
through the services of a third-party proxy solicitation firm. The estimated
cost of using a third-party solicitation firm is approximately $12,000. NOVA
will also make arrangements with brokerage firms and other custodians, nominees
and fiduciaries to forward proxy solicitation materials to the beneficial owners
of NOVA common stock held of record by such persons. The entire cost of
soliciting proxies under this proxy statement/ prospectus will be borne by NOVA
and will include amounts paid in reimbursement to banks, brokerage firms,
custodians, nominees and others for their reasonable expenses in forwarding
soliciting material to the beneficial owners of NOVA common stock held of record
by that person.

BOARD RECOMMENDATION

    NOVA's board of directors has unanimously approved the merger agreement and
the merger. The board has determined that the merger is fair to, and in the best
interests of, NOVA's shareholders and recommends that NOVA's shareholders vote
"FOR" approval of the merger agreement and the merger.

                                   THE MERGER

    THIS SECTION OF THE PROXY STATEMENT/PROSPECTUS DESCRIBES THE MATERIAL
ASPECTS OF THE PROPOSED MERGER. WHILE WE BELIEVE THAT THE DESCRIPTION COVERS THE
MATERIAL TERMS OF THE MERGER AND THE RELATED TRANSACTIONS, THIS SUMMARY MAY NOT
CONTAIN ALL OF THE INFORMATION THAT IS IMPORTANT TO YOU. YOU SHOULD READ
CAREFULLY THIS ENTIRE DOCUMENT, THE ATTACHED APPENDICES AND THE OTHER DOCUMENTS
WE REFER TO FOR A MORE COMPLETE UNDERSTANDING OF THE MERGER. THE MERGER
AGREEMENT EXECUTED ON MAY 7, 2001 IS ATTACHED TO THIS PROXY STATEMENT/PROSPECTUS
AS APPENDIX A AND IS INCORPORATED INTO THIS PROXY STATEMENT/PROSPECTUS BY
REFERENCE.

BACKGROUND OF THE MERGER

    NOVA has from time to time, in pursuit of its strategic goals and long-term
business and growth strategy, discussed and considered various strategic
alternatives, including alliances, joint ventures, acquisitions, divestitures,
mergers and other business combinations, leveraging transactions and other
strategic alternatives. In the late summer of 1999, NOVA's board of directors
engaged Salomon Smith Barney to assist and advise NOVA in considering potential
transactions that may be in the best interests of NOVA and its shareholders.
Throughout the remainder of 1999 and during 2000, Salomon Smith Barney explored
various strategic alternatives and located certain third parties (including
U.S. Bancorp) interested in discussing possible transactions with NOVA. NOVA
received information and frequent updates from Salomon Smith Barney on each
third party indication of interest in pursuing a transaction with NOVA. However,
after reviewing, considering and discussing these indications of interest, NOVA
determined that, in light of market conditions, particularly in the latter part
of 2000, none of the potential transactions fit NOVA's strategic goals or
offered adequate value to NOVA's shareholders.

    In October 2000, U.S. Bancorp and Firstar Corporation announced their
proposed merger. At that time, NOVA had an existing relationship with Firstar
through Elan Merchant Services, LLC, an entity formed as part of a joint venture
arrangement between Firstar and NOVA under which NOVA provides transaction
processing services to Firstar's merchant customers. Because of the proposed
Firstar and U.S. Bancorp merger, beginning in late 2000 and continuing through
the first quarter of 2001, NOVA and U.S. Bancorp held discussions relating to
the Elan joint venture. These discussions included due diligence evaluations of
the NOVA business by U.S. Bancorp and the U.S. Bancorp merchant business by
NOVA.

    During 2001, NOVA's senior management had discussions related to potential
transactions with several parties other than U.S. Bancorp. These discussions
resulted in a proposal from one of the parties, which in turn led to further
preliminary discussions regarding a possible business combination and a due
diligence evaluation of NOVA by this party. Due primarily to significant open
issues that could not be resolved and concerns on the part of the NOVA board
that a transaction with this party could not ultimately be completed, NOVA and
the other party terminated discussions prior to finalizing the terms of the
transaction between NOVA and U.S. Bancorp.

    On April 24, 2001, U.S. Bancorp submitted to NOVA a preliminary proposal,
subject to due diligence and other conditions, outlining a transaction in which
U.S. Bancorp would acquire NOVA's outstanding common stock for approximately
$30.00 per share. During the remainder of the week in which the proposal was
made, senior management of NOVA and NOVA's financial advisors continued
discussions with U.S. Bancorp to further explore U.S. Bancorp's proposal. During
the week of April 30, 2001, representatives of U.S. Bancorp met in Atlanta with
NOVA's senior management and conducted additional due diligence regarding NOVA.
On April 30, 2001, U.S. Bancorp's legal counsel also circulated an initial draft
of a definitive merger agreement to NOVA and its legal counsel. On May 2, 2001,
U.S. Bancorp, after completing its on-site due diligence review, confirmed its
interest in an acquisition of NOVA at the $30.00 per share level.

    At the regularly scheduled meeting of NOVA's board of directors held on
May 3, 2001, the board reviewed, considered and discussed U.S. Bancorp's initial
written offer and the subsequent progression of negotiations and discussions
between the parties. NOVA's management and legal advisors and Salomon Smith
Barney participated in this meeting. NOVA's outside counsel reviewed the board's
fiduciary duties in connection with business combination transactions, including
the proposed U.S. Bancorp transaction. At this meeting, NOVA's board considered
the indications of interest in other transactions that it had received over the
last year and a half. NOVA's board of directors determined, in light of all the
factors being considered, including the discussions with other parties regarding
potential transactions, that the proposed transaction with U.S. Bancorp appeared
to be in the best interests of NOVA and its shareholders and to further the
long-term business and growth strategy and other strategic goals of NOVA.
Accordingly, NOVA's board authorized and directed NOVA's senior management to
continue discussions and negotiations with U.S. Bancorp concerning its offer and
the proposed merger agreement.

    During the three days following the NOVA board meeting, the parties
continued discussions and negotiations. During this period, the senior
management of each of NOVA and U.S. Bancorp, together with their respective
legal advisors, finalized the terms of the proposed merger agreement.

    On May 6, 2001, NOVA's board of directors held a telephonic meeting to
consider the proposed U.S. Bancorp transaction and related merger agreement. At
this meeting NOVA's board carefully reviewed, considered and analyzed the U.S.
Bancorp transaction as set forth in the merger agreement. The board also again
reviewed the other indications of interest and the proposal it had received from
another party. In consultation with Salomon Smith Barney and NOVA's legal
counsel, the board evaluated and analyzed the benefits, costs, risks and other
factors relating to the proposed U.S. Bancorp transaction (including, among
other matters, the financial, strategic and other value, as well as the
likelihood of the transaction being consummated) and discussed whether any other
strategic alternatives should be pursued. Also, at this meeting Salomon Smith
Barney reviewed its financial analysis of the consideration payable to NOVA
shareholders in the proposed transaction with U.S. Bancorp, and rendered to
NOVA's board of directors a written opinion dated May 6, 2001, to the effect
that, as of the date of the opinion and based upon and subject to certain
matters stated in such opinion, the consideration to be received by NOVA's
shareholders in the transaction was fair, from a financial point of view, to the
shareholders. Based on the foregoing, NOVA's board determined that the U.S.
Bancorp transaction was superior to the other possible transactions and would be
in the best interests of NOVA and its shareholders. Accordingly, the board
unanimously approved the U.S. Bancorp merger and the merger agreement, and
authorized the execution and delivery of the merger agreement and the related
documents.

    The definitive merger agreement was executed by NOVA and U.S. Bancorp on
May 7, 2001.

U.S. BANCORP'S REASONS FOR THE MERGER

    U.S. Bancorp's board of directors and management believe that the merger
will provide U.S. Bancorp with an attractive opportunity to expand its merchant
processing business, particularly with small to medium-sized customers. U.S.
Bancorp believes that NOVA's experience in the merchant processing business and
its market position complement U.S. Bancorp's current merchant processing
operations, and that the merger will enable U.S. Bancorp to offer, through NOVA,
a broad array of merchant processing products and services to a larger market.

NOVA'S REASONS FOR THE MERGER AND RECOMMENDATION OF NOVA'S BOARD OF DIRECTORS

    In deciding to approve the merger agreement and to recommend approval of the
merger by NOVA's shareholders, NOVA's board consulted with senior management and
its financial and legal advisors and considered a number of factors, including
particularly the factors listed below. In view of

the number and wide variety of factors that NOVA's board considered in
connection with its evaluation of the merger, NOVA's board did not consider it
practicable to, nor did it attempt to, quantify or otherwise assign relative
weights to the specific factors considered in reaching its determination. NOVA's
board viewed its position and recommendations as being based on all of the
information and factors that it received and considered. In addition, individual
directors may have given different weight to different information and factors.

    FINANCIAL TERMS OF THE MERGER.  The board of directors of NOVA believes that
the consideration that U.S. Bancorp will deliver to shareholders of NOVA is fair
to the shareholders based upon:

    - NOVA's current financial condition and future prospects;

    - the current financial condition and future prospects of U.S. Bancorp; and

    - the board's perception of the future prospects of the combined entities.

In reaching this conclusion, NOVA's board evaluated the strategic alternatives
available to NOVA.

    COMPARING NOVA'S VALUE AS A CONTINUING INDEPENDENT ENTITY WITH ITS VALUE IN
COMBINATION WITH U.S. BANCORP.  NOVA's board believes that the value to be
received by NOVA shareholders in the merger is substantially greater than that
available in NOVA as a continuing independent entity currently and for the
near-term.

    COMPARING A COMBINATION WITH U.S. BANCORP TO OTHER POSSIBLE
TRANSACTIONS.  NOVA's board reviewed the range of the possible values to NOVA
shareholders obtainable through implementation of certain other strategic
alternatives and the likelihood and risks of the same. Considering all factors,
including, in the case of the other proposal referred to above, the remaining
unresolved issues and the risk that such other transaction could not be
completed, the board concluded that the U.S. Bancorp proposal was superior to
other possible transactions.

    LIQUIDITY FOR NOVA SHAREHOLDERS.  The merger provides liquidity to NOVA
shareholders in the form of U.S. Bancorp common stock and, to the extent
provided in the merger agreement, cash.

    AVAILABILITY OF ADDITIONAL RESOURCES.  NOVA's board considered the need for
additional capital resources in order to achieve NOVA's own strategic business
plan and the fact that these resources were more readily available to NOVA in
combination with U.S. Bancorp than as a continuing independent entity.

    THE TRANSACTION PROCESSING INDUSTRY GENERALLY.  NOVA's board considered the
current and prospective economic and competitive environment facing the
transaction processing industry generally and NOVA in particular. Among other
factors, the board considered the continued consolidation in the industry and
the increasing importance of operational scale and financial resources in
maintaining efficiencies and remaining competitive and in being able to
capitalize on technological developments that significantly impact industry
competition.

    TAX-FREE NATURE OF THE TRANSACTION.  NOVA's board considered the fact that
for federal income tax purposes the merger is structured with the intent that it
will qualify as a tax-free reorganization for NOVA shareholders to the extent
that they receive U.S. Bancorp common stock in the merger.

    OPINION OF SALOMON SMITH BARNEY.  NOVA's board considered the fact that
Salomon Smith Barney has rendered its opinion that the consideration to be
provided by U.S. Bancorp to NOVA's shareholders under the merger agreement is
fair from a financial point of view to those shareholders.

    In addition to the factors set forth above, NOVA's board evaluated the
likelihood of closing the transaction expeditiously. The board also considered
the possible circumstances under which NOVA could incur the cost of a
termination fee upon the termination of the merger agreement, as well as the

other consequences to NOVA under the merger agreement and otherwise, if the
transaction is terminated.

    The terms of the termination fee, particularly the amount, were the subject
of negotiations between the parties. NOVA's board ultimately accepted the size
and terms of the termination fee contained in the merger agreement, as well as
other consequences of termination, as necessary to limit subsequent competing
offers to only those offers that should be seriously considered by the board in
the exercise of its fiduciary obligations.

    FOR THE REASONS SET FORTH ABOVE, NOVA'S BOARD OF DIRECTORS HAS APPROVED THE
MERGER AGREEMENT AS IN THE BEST INTERESTS OF NOVA AND ITS SHAREHOLDERS AND
UNANIMOUSLY RECOMMENDS THAT NOVA SHAREHOLDERS APPROVE THE MERGER AGREEMENT AND
THE MERGER.

FAIRNESS OPINION OF NOVA'S FINANCIAL ADVISOR

    Salomon Smith Barney was retained to act as financial advisor to NOVA in
connection with the merger. Pursuant to Salomon Smith Barney's engagement
letter, Salomon Smith Barney rendered an opinion to NOVA's board of directors on
May 6, 2001 to the effect that, based upon and subject to the considerations and
limitations set forth in its opinion, Salomon Smith Barney's experience as
investment bankers, its work described below and other factors it deemed
relevant, as of that date, the consideration to be received by the holders of
NOVA common stock pursuant to the merger was fair, from a financial point of
view, to those holders.

    The full text of Salomon Smith Barney's opinion dated May 6, 2001, which
sets forth, among other things, the assumptions made, general procedures
followed, matters considered and limits on the review undertaken, is attached as
Appendix B to this document. The summary of Salomon Smith Barney's opinion set
forth below is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the
opinion. YOU ARE URGED TO READ SALOMON SMITH BARNEY'S OPINION CAREFULLY AND IN
ITS ENTIRETY.

    In arriving at its opinion, Salomon Smith Barney:

    - reviewed a draft of the merger agreement;

    - held discussions with selected senior officers and other representatives
      and advisors of NOVA and selected senior officers and other
      representatives and advisors of U.S. Bancorp concerning the businesses,
      operations and prospects of NOVA and U.S. Bancorp;

    - examined certain publicly available business and financial information
      relating to NOVA and U.S. Bancorp as well as certain other information and
      data for NOVA and U.S. Bancorp that were provided to or otherwise
      discussed with Salomon Smith Barney by the management teams of NOVA and
      U.S. Bancorp;

    - reviewed the financial terms of the merger as set forth in the merger
      agreement in relation to, among other things, current and historical
      market prices and trading volumes of the common stock of each of NOVA and
      U.S. Bancorp, the historical and projected earnings and other operating
      data of NOVA and U.S. Bancorp, the historical capitalization and financial
      condition of NOVA and U.S. Bancorp and the projected capitalization of
      U.S. Bancorp;

    - considered, to the extent publicly available, the financial terms of
      certain other similar transactions recently effected that Salomon Smith
      Barney considered relevant in evaluating the merger and analyzed certain
      financial, stock market and other publicly available information relating
      to the businesses of other companies whose operations Salomon Smith Barney
      considered relevant in evaluating those of NOVA and U.S. Bancorp;

    - evaluated the pro forma financial impact of the merger on U.S. Bancorp;
      and

    - conducted other analyses and examinations and considered such other
      information and financial, economic and market criteria as it deemed
      appropriate in arriving at its opinion.

    In rendering its opinion, Salomon Smith Barney assumed and relied, without
independent verification, upon the accuracy and completeness of all financial
and other information and data publicly available or furnished to or otherwise
reviewed by or discussed with Salomon Smith Barney. With respect to financial
forecasts and other information and data provided to or otherwise reviewed by or
discussed with Salomon Smith Barney, Salomon Smith Barney relied on publicly
available third-party equity research forecasts, and Salomon Smith Barney
expressed no view with respect to those forecasts and other information and data
or the assumptions on which they were based. Salomon Smith Barney did not make
and was not provided with an independent evaluation or appraisal of any of the
assets or liabilities (contingent or otherwise) of NOVA or U.S. Bancorp nor has
Salomon Smith Barney made any physical inspection of the properties or assets of
NOVA or U.S. Bancorp. Salomon Smith Barney assumed, with the consent of NOVA's
board of directors, that the merger will be treated as a tax-free reorganization
for federal income tax purposes to the extent the consideration received is in
stock and as a purchase transaction in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles. Salomon Smith Barney did not express any opinion as to
what the value of the U.S. Bancorp common stock actually will be when issued in
the merger or the price at which the U.S. Bancorp common stock will trade
subsequent to the merger. Representatives of NOVA advised Salomon Smith Barney,
and Salomon Smith Barney assumed, that the final terms of the merger agreement
would not vary materially from those set forth in the draft reviewed by Salomon
Smith Barney. Salomon Smith Barney further assumed that the merger will be
consummated in a timely fashion and in accordance with the terms of the merger
agreement without waiver of any of the conditions precedent to the merger
contained in the merger agreement. Salomon Smith Barney expressed no view as to,
and its opinion did not address, the relative merits of the merger as compared
to any alternative business strategies that might exist for NOVA or the effect
of any other transaction in which NOVA might engage. Salomon Smith Barney's
opinion necessarily was based on information available to it, and financial,
stock market and other conditions and circumstances existing and disclosed to
Salomon Smith Barney as of the date of the opinion.

    SALOMON SMITH BARNEY'S ADVISORY SERVICES AND ITS OPINION WERE PROVIDED FOR
THE INFORMATION OF NOVA'S BOARD OF DIRECTORS IN ITS EVALUATION OF THE PROPOSED
MERGER, AND SALOMON SMITH BARNEY'S OPINION IS NOT INTENDED TO BE AND DOES NOT
CONSTITUTE A RECOMMENDATION TO NOVA OR ITS SHAREHOLDERS, NOR DOES IT CONSTITUTE
A RECOMMENDATION TO ANY SHAREHOLDER AS TO HOW THAT SHAREHOLDER SHOULD VOTE ON
ANY MATTER RELATING TO THE MERGER.

    In connection with rendering its opinion, Salomon Smith Barney made a
presentation to NOVA's board of directors on May 6, 2001 with respect to the
material analyses performed by Salomon Smith Barney in evaluating the fairness
to NOVA from a financial point of view of the consideration to be received by
the holders of NOVA common stock in the merger. The following is a summary of
this presentation. The summary includes information presented in tabular format.
IN ORDER TO UNDERSTAND FULLY THE FINANCIAL ANALYSES USED BY SALOMON SMITH
BARNEY, THESE TABLES MUST BE READ TOGETHER WITH THE TEXT OF EACH SUMMARY. THE
TABLES ALONE DO NOT CONSTITUTE A COMPLETE DESCRIPTION OF THE FINANCIAL ANALYSES.
The following quantitative information, to the extent it is based on market
data, is, except as otherwise indicated, based on market data as it existed at
or prior to May 4, 2001 and is not necessarily indicative of current or future
market conditions.

    TRANSACTION PRICING MULTIPLES ANALYSIS.  Based on the closing price of NOVA
common stock on May 4, 2001 of $23.52, Salomon Smith Barney analyzed the implied
per share transaction value of $31.00 as a multiple of NOVA's LTM EPS and
estimated EPS for the years 2001 and 2002. Salomon Smith Barney also analyzed
the implied firm value, obtained by adding to equity value $225.5 million in
debt and subtracting therefrom $20.4 million in cash, as a multiple of 2000 net
revenues and LTM

EBITDA. Salomon Smith Barney further analyzed the 2002 P/E multiple as a
percentage of the long-term growth rate based on mean IBES estimates. These
analyses indicated the following:

                                                                                   TRANSACTION

    The LTM EPS and LTM EBITDA were based on NOVA data for the twelve months
ended March 31, 2001. EPS data for 2001 and 2002 were based on mean IBES
estimates.

    IMPLIED MARKET PREMIUM ANALYSIS.  Salomon Smith Barney analyzed the implied
per share transaction value of $31.00 as a premium to the closing market price
of NOVA common stock on May 4, 2001 and on April 4, 2001 and to the lowest and
highest closing market prices of NOVA common stock during the 52-week period
ending May 4, 2001. This analysis indicated the following:

    PRECEDENT TRANSACTIONS ANALYSIS.  Salomon Smith Barney analyzed financial,
operating and stock market information for selected comparable merger
transactions in the transaction processing industry. Salomon Smith Barney
divided these transactions into the following three groups (in each case, the
first named company is the acquired company and the second named company is the
acquiror):

    - TRANSACTIONS SINCE JANUARY 1, 1994. Salomon Smith Barney reviewed 12
      transactions that involved transaction processing companies and occurred
      between January 1, 1994 and May 4, 2001. The transactions in this group
      were: Universal Companies/Fifth Third Bancorp, Card Payment
      Systems/Concord EFS, SPS Network Services/Alliance Data Systems,
      Paymentech, Inc./First Data Corp., BA Merchant Services, Inc./ BankAmerica
      Corp., SPS Transactions Services/Associates First Capital, Electronic
      Payment Services, Inc./ Concord EFS, PMT Services, Inc./NOVA Corporation,
      GENSAR/Paymentech, Inc., First Financial Management/First Data Corp., Card
      Establishment Svcs./First Data Corp., Envoy Corp. Financial/First Data
      Corp.

    - TRANSACTIONS SINCE JANUARY 1, 1999. Salomon Smith Barney reviewed four
      transactions that involved transaction processing companies and occurred
      between January 1, 1999 and May 4, 2001. The transactions in this group
      were: Universal Companies/Fifth Third Bancorp, Card Payment
      Systems/Concord EFS, SPS Network Services/Alliance Data Systems,
      Paymentech, Inc./ First Data Corp.

    - TRANSACTIONS OVER $500 MILLION. Salomon Smith Barney reviewed five
      transactions that involved transaction processing companies, occurred
      between January 1, 1994 and May 4, 2001 and had a transaction value of
      more than $500 million. The transactions in this group were: SPS
      Transactions Services/Associates First Capital, Electronic Payment
      Services, Inc./Concord EFS,

      PMT Services, Inc./NOVA Corporation, First Financial Management/First Data
      Corp., Card Establishment Svcs./First Data Corp.

    Salomon Smith Barney derived for each of the precedent transactions:

    - the ratio of the per share price in the transaction to the acquired
      company's: (1) earnings per share (or "EPS") for the last twelve-month
      period for which results were available (or "LTM") and (2) projected EPS,
      based upon mean I/B/E/S International Inc.'s (or "IBES") estimates of net
      earnings for the fiscal year following the announcement of the transaction
      (IBES is a data service that monitors and publishes compilations of
      earning estimates by selected research analysts regarding companies of
      interest to institutional investors);

    - the ratio of firm value, defined as the aggregate purchase price of equity
      plus total debt assumed less balance sheet cash and cash equivalents, to
      the acquired company's: (1) LTM revenues, (2) LTM earnings before
      interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (or "EBITDA") and (3) LTM
      earnings before interest and taxes (or "EBIT");

    - the premium implied by the per share price in the transaction to the
      market price per share of the acquired company's common stock on the last
      trading day prior to the announcement of the transaction; and

    - the premium implied by the per share price in the transaction to the
      market price per share of the acquired company's common stock one month
      prior to the announcement of the transaction.

    The results of these analyses are summarized in the following table:

                                                                                               TRANSACTION

    Salomon Smith Barney applied the median multiple or premium from each
methodology listed above to the applicable statistics for NOVA to determine
implied per share values for NOVA and then took the median of those results.
From this information, Salomon Smith Barney imputed a range of per share values
of NOVA common stock of $26.00 to $32.00 for all transactions from January 1,
1994 through May 4, 2001 and $27.00 to $33.00 for all transactions from
January 1, 1994 through May 4, 2001 having a transaction value over
$500 million. Salomon Smith Barney noted that the implied value per share of
NOVA common stock, assuming an amount of $31 per share to be received by holders
of NOVA common stock pursuant to the merger, tended toward the upper limit of
both reference ranges derived by Salomon Smith Barney in its precedent
transactions analysis.

    DISCOUNTED CASH FLOW ANALYSIS.  Salomon Smith Barney performed a discounted
cash flow analysis to estimate a range of implied present values per share of
NOVA common stock, as of May 4, 2001, assuming NOVA continued to operate as a
stand-alone entity. This range was determined by adding (1) the present value of
NOVA's projected free cash flows available to common shareholders from May 4,
2001 through December 31, 2005, and (2) the present value of the terminal value
of NOVA's common stock as of December 31, 2005. Salomon Smith Barney calculated
free cash flow as net income, plus depreciation and amortization, minus capital
expenditures and minus additional increases in net working capital. The
projections which formed the bases for the free cash flows and the terminal
value were obtained from mean IBES estimates of NOVA's net income for 2001 and
2002, NOVA's management's estimates of depreciation, amortization, capital
expenditures and changes in working capital for 2001 through 2005, and estimates
for NOVA's long-term net income annual growth rate beyond 2002 ranging from a
high-end growth rate of 19.2% (based on the estimated five-year annual EPS
growth rate as provided by IBES) and a low-end growth rate of 12.5%
(representing the implied annual EPS growth rate as estimated by IBES between
calendar year 2001 and 2002). In calculating a terminal value of NOVA common
stock at the end of the period, Salomon Smith Barney applied a range of
price-to-earnings (or "P/E") multiples, ranging from 15.0x to 19.0x, to
projected net income for fiscal 2006 with a mid-point of 17.0x based on the
trading value of NOVA common stock as of May 4, 2001. The free cash flows and
terminal value were then discounted back to May 4, 2001 using a low-end discount
rate of 12.3% and a high-end discount rate of 17.5%. The low-end discount rate
was derived assuming a risk-free rate of 5.8%, a market risk premium of 5.5% and
a beta of 1.18% and the high-end discount rate was derived assuming a market
risk premium of 7.5% and a beta of 1.56%, which Salomon Smith Barney viewed as
the appropriate discount rate range for a company with NOVA's risk
characteristics.

    Based on these assumptions, Salomon Smith Barney derived a reference range
for the implied stand-alone per share value of NOVA common stock of $22.50 to
$28.50 assuming a low-end growth rate in net income beyond 2002 of 12.5% and a
reference range for the implied stand-alone per share value of NOVA common stock
of $28.00 to $35.00 assuming a high-end growth rate in net income beyond 2002 of
19.2%. Salomon Smith Barney noted that the implied value per share of NOVA
common stock, assuming an amount of $31.00 per share to be received by holders
of NOVA common stock pursuant to the merger, was above the reference range of
the implied per share value of NOVA common stock obtained by applying a low-end
growth rate and within the reference range of the implied per share value of
NOVA common stock obtained by applying a high-end growth rate.

    FORECASTED PRO FORMA FINANCIAL ANALYSIS.  Salomon Smith Barney analyzed, at
and for the years ending December 31, 2001, 2002 and 2003, the pro forma
financial impact of the merger on U.S. Bancorp's capital ratios, fully diluted
EPS, fully diluted cash EPS (or "CEPS") and fully diluted tangible book value
per share. For purposes of these analyses, Salomon Smith Barney assumed that the
merger would close at the beginning of the fourth quarter of 2001 and utilized
mean IBES EPS estimates for NOVA and U.S. Bancorp for 2001 and 2002 as adjusted
for the then-anticipated impact of the accounting pronouncements eliminating
goodwill amortization expenses. Salomon Smith Barney performed this analysis
using U.S. Bancorp management's assumptions with respect to estimated annual

cost savings expected to result from the merger. Salomon Smith Barney's analysis
of the merger showed that the merger, compared to the continued operation of
U.S. Bancorp on a stand alone basis, would be dilutive to U.S. Bancorp's EPS by
2.5% in 2001, 1.6% in 2002 and 1.3% in 2003, dilutive to U.S. Bancorp's
estimated CEPS by 0.5% in 2001 and accretive to U.S. Bancorp's CEPS by 1.4% in
2002 and 1.1% in 2003, and dilutive to U.S. Bancorp's tangible book value per
share by 11.8% in 2001, 8.5% in 2002 and 6.5% in 2003. It was also determined
that the merger, compared to the continued operation of U.S. Bancorp on a
stand-alone basis, would slightly lower its capital ratios as reported by U.S.
Bancorp.

    Salomon Smith Barney also reviewed selected balance sheet information,
income statement information (including interest income, non-interest income and
non-interest expenses) and performance ratios for each of NOVA, U.S. Bancorp
and, on a pro forma basis, the combined company for the 12-month period ended
March 31, 2001.

    COMPARATIVE OPERATING PERFORMANCE AND COMPANY DESCRIPTION.  Salomon Smith
Barney reviewed NOVA's comparative gross profit, EBITDA, EBIT and net income
margins for the years 1998 through 2000 and LTM as of March 31, 2001 and NOVA's
comparative gross revenue, operating profit and EPS growth rates on a quarterly
basis throughout 2000 versus the comparable period in 1999. Comparative
performance ratios, diluted EPS and revenue per share growth rates, capital
ratios and credit statistics were reviewed for the years 1996 through 2000 for
U.S. Bancorp. In each case, Salomon Smith Barney also reviewed the comparable
median statistics of a peer group consisting of transaction processing companies
in the case of NOVA and super-regional banks in the case of U.S. Bancorp.

    Salomon Smith Barney provided a description of U.S. Bancorp's operations,
reviewing principal business segments, branch locations, deposits market share,
management positions, loan portfolio and U.S. Bancorp's payment system division.

    HISTORICAL MARKET STATISTICS.  Salomon Smith Barney analyzed the historical
shareholder returns for NOVA for the last one-, three- and five-year periods and
the year to date and compared such stock price appreciation and depreciation to
the S&P 500 Index, the NASDAQ 100 Index and an index of financial outsourcing
companies. Salomon Smith Barney also analyzed the stock market performance for
NOVA and U.S. Bancorp for the last one-, three-, five- and 10-year periods and
the year to date and compared such performance to a peer group bank index, the
S&P Bank Composite Index and the S&P 500 Index. Salomon Smith Barney analyzed
the U.S. Bancorp stock price as of May 4, 2001 and the resulting market
capitalization, the ratio of price to 2001 EPS, 2002 EPS, book value and
tangible book value and the estimated long-term net income growth rate and in
each case compared these values to the median statistics for a banking peer
group. Salomon Smith Barney analyzed the NOVA stock price as of May 4, 2001 and
the resulting market capitalization, the ratio of price to LTM earnings, 2001
EPS and 2002 EPS and the ratio of firm value to revenue and LTM EBITDA. Salomon
Smith Barney also reviewed the mean IBES estimates for five-year projected EPS
growth, 2002 P/E as a percentage of the long-term growth rate, projected EPS
growth between 2001 and 2002 based on mean IBES estimates, and the ratio of debt
to capital. As part of this review, Salomon Smith Barney in each case compared
NOVA's statistics to the median statistics for a peer group of transaction
processing companies.

    Although Salomon Smith Barney reviewed the historical stock market
performance and other market statistics of NOVA and certain peer group
companies, it did not undertake a "comparable companies" analysis comparing the
implied per share value of NOVA common stock against the common stock of various
peer group companies because it determined that the other companies operating in
the transaction processing industry have fundamental financial and/or operating
characteristics which are different from those of NOVA and that therefore any
such analysis would not offer a meaningful evaluation of the transaction.

                                  *    *    *

    The preceding discussion is a summary of the material financial analyses
furnished by Salomon Smith Barney to NOVA's board of directors but it does not
purport to be a complete description of the analyses performed by Salomon Smith
Barney or its presentations to NOVA's board of directors. The preparation of
financial analyses and fairness opinions is a complex process involving
subjective judgments and is not necessarily susceptible to partial analysis or
summary description. Salomon Smith Barney made no attempt to assign specific
weights to particular analyses or factors considered, but rather made
qualitative judgments as to the significance and relevance of all the analyses
and factors considered and determined to give its fairness opinion as described
above. Accordingly, Salomon Smith Barney believes that its analyses, and the
summary set forth above, must be considered as a whole, and that selecting
portions of the analyses and of the factors considered by Salomon Smith Barney,
without considering all of the analyses and factors, could create a misleading
or incomplete view of the processes underlying the analyses conducted by Salomon
Smith Barney and its opinion.

    With regard to precedent transaction analyses summarized above, Salomon
Smith Barney selected the transactions on the basis of various factors,
including the size and nature of the company. However, no transaction utilized
as a comparison in the precedent transaction analysis summarized above, is
identical to the merger. As a result, these analyses are not purely
mathematical, but also take into account differences in financial and operating
characteristics as well as other factors that could affect the transactions to
which the merger is being compared. In its analyses, Salomon Smith Barney made
numerous assumptions with respect to NOVA, U.S. Bancorp, industry performance,
general business, economic, market and financial conditions and other matters,
many of which are beyond the control of NOVA and U.S. Bancorp. Any estimates
contained in Salomon Smith Barney's analyses are not necessarily indicative of
actual values or predictive of future results or values, which may be
significantly more or less favorable than those suggested by these analyses.
Estimates of values of companies do not purport to be appraisals or necessarily
to reflect the prices at which companies may actually be sold. Because these
estimates are inherently subject to uncertainty, none of NOVA, U.S. Bancorp,
NOVA's board of directors, Salomon Smith Barney or any other person assumes
responsibility if future results or actual values differ materially from the
estimates.

    Salomon Smith Barney's analyses were prepared solely as part of Salomon
Smith Barney's analysis of the fairness of the consideration to be received by
the holders of NOVA common stock pursuant to the merger and were provided to
NOVA's board of directors in that connection. The opinion of Salomon Smith
Barney was only one of the many factors taken into consideration by NOVA's board
of directors in making its determination to approve the merger agreement and the
merger and to proceed with the merger. See "--NOVA's Reasons for the Merger and
Recommendation of NOVA's Board of Directors."

    Salomon Smith Barney is an internationally recognized investment banking
firm engaged, among other things, in the valuation of businesses and their
securities in connection with mergers and acquisitions, restructurings,
leveraged buyouts, negotiated underwritings, competitive biddings, secondary
distributions of listed and unlisted securities, private placements and
valuations for estate, corporate and other purposes. NOVA selected Salomon Smith
Barney to act as its financial advisor on the basis of Salomon Smith Barney's
international reputation. Salomon Smith Barney has in the past provided
investment banking services to NOVA and U.S. Bancorp unrelated to the merger,
for which Salomon Smith Barney has received compensation. In the ordinary course
of its business, Salomon Smith Barney and its affiliates may actively trade or
hold the securities of NOVA and U.S. Bancorp for its own account or for the
accounts of customers and, accordingly, may at any time hold a long or short
position in these securities. Salomon Smith Barney and its affiliates (including
Citigroup Inc. and its affiliates) may maintain other business relationships
with NOVA, U.S. Bancorp and their respective affiliates.

    Pursuant to Salomon Smith Barney's engagement letter, NOVA agreed to pay
Salomon Smith Barney for its services rendered in connection with the merger, a
cash fee equal to 0.55% of the

transaction value, of which $1,000,000 is payable upon delivery of the opinion,
and the balance is payable upon consummation of the merger. NOVA has also agreed
to reimburse Salomon Smith Barney for its reasonable travel and other
out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection with its engagement, including the
reasonable fees and disbursements of its counsel, and to indemnify Salomon Smith
Barney against specific liabilities and expenses relating to or arising out of
its engagement, including liabilities under the federal securities laws.

THE MERGER AGREEMENT

    The merger agreement executed on May 7, 2001 is attached to this proxy
statement/prospectus as Appendix A and is incorporated into this proxy
statement/prospectus by reference. The following paragraphs describe the
principal provisions of the merger agreement.

THE MERGER

    Subject to the terms and conditions of the merger agreement, at the
effective time of the merger, NOVA will merge with and into U.S. Bancorp. U.S.
Bancorp will be the surviving corporation and will continue its existence under
the Delaware General Corporation Law.

    Alternatively, U.S. Bancorp and NOVA may agree to merge NOVA into a wholly
owned subsidiary of U.S. Bancorp as long as (a) no change occurs to the amount,
kind or method of determining the U.S. Bancorp common stock or cash
consideration to be received by NOVA shareholders, (b) the tax treatment of the
merger is not adversely affected and (c) there is no material delay or
imposition towards completion of the merger. In this case, the wholly owned
subsidiary of U.S. Bancorp would be the surviving corporation in the merger.

    At the effective time, the separate existence of NOVA will terminate, and
you will cease to be a shareholder of NOVA and will have no rights as a
shareholder of NOVA, other than to receive any dividend or other distribution
with respect to NOVA common stock with a record date occurring prior to the
effective date of the merger. Instead, you will have the right to receive the
merger consideration described below in "--Merger Consideration" unless you
exercise your right to dissent from the merger. After the effective time, there
will be no transfers on the stock transfer books of NOVA or U.S. Bancorp of
shares of NOVA's common stock.

EFFECTIVENESS OF THE MERGER

    The effective date for the merger will be a date within two business days of
the day on which the last to be satisfied or waived of the conditions to
completion of the merger, as set forth in the merger agreement, has been
fulfilled or waived, unless NOVA and U.S. Bancorp agree to a later date. The
effective time of the merger will be the time on the effective date when the
merger will become effective.

MERGER CONSIDERATION

    ELECTION OF CONSIDERATION

    At the effective time, each share of NOVA common stock issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the effective time will be converted, subject
to antidilution adjustments as provided in the merger agreement and described
below, into the right to receive the merger consideration, which may be subject
to proration or adjustment as explained below in "--Oversubscription of Cash or
Stock" and "--Tax Adjustment." You may elect to receive cash, shares of U.S.
Bancorp common stock or a combination of cash and shares of U.S. Bancorp common
stock. The cash consideration is $31.00, without interest, per share of NOVA
common stock. The stock consideration is 1.407 shares of U.S.

Bancorp common stock per share of NOVA common stock unless U.S. Bancorp elects
to increase this stock exchange ratio as described in "--Termination of the
Merger Agreement--Termination."

    If you wish to receive a combination of cash and shares of U.S. Bancorp
common stock, you must designate how many of your NOVA shares you wish to
convert into cash, and how many you wish to convert into shares of U.S. Bancorp
common stock. However, the amount of cash and the number of shares of common
stock U.S. Bancorp will issue in the merger is subject to limitations described
below in "--Oversubscription of Cash or Stock." Consequently, the amounts of
cash and/or U.S. Bancorp common stock you actually receive may be different from
the amounts you elected to receive.

    The cash exchange ratio of $31.00 per NOVA share, and the stock exchange
ratio of 1.407 U.S. Bancorp shares per NOVA share, are fixed. Regardless of what
happens to the market value of the NOVA common stock prior to the merger, and
regardless of what happens to the market value of the U.S. Bancorp common stock
prior to and after the merger, the amount of cash or the number of U.S. Bancorp
shares that a NOVA shareholder will receive, either due to the shareholder's
election or the possible adjustments described above, will not be more or less
than $31.00 or 1.407 U.S. Bancorp shares per NOVA share (unless an adjustment is
made, as described below under "--Tax Adjustment"). We cannot assure you what
the value of the U.S. Bancorp shares, if any, you receive in the merger will be
when you actually receive them after the merger is completed. The stock exchange
ratio of 1.407 shares of U.S. Bancorp common stock per NOVA share may not
reflect the closing sales price of the U.S. Bancorp common stock immediately
before, as of or after completion of the merger.

    A form of election and a copy of this proxy statement/prospectus were
separately mailed to each holder of record of NOVA common stock. The form of
election will permit you to make an election as described above. NOVA common
stock held by a shareholder who fails to submit a valid form of election prior
to the election deadline described below under "--Election Procedures; Exchange
Agent," will be treated as "no-election shares" for which no preference as to
the receipt of cash or U.S. Bancorp common stock has been indicated. These
shares will be exchanged for cash, shares of U.S. Bancorp common stock or a
combination of the two at the discretion of U.S. Bancorp.

    OVERSUBSCRIPTION OF CASH OR STOCK

    Regardless of what you elect to receive in the merger, and subject to an
adjustment for tax reasons (as described below in "--Tax Adjustment"), the
aggregate amounts of cash and common stock that U.S. Bancorp will issue in the
merger are fixed under the terms of the merger agreement. The aggregate amount
of cash that U.S. Bancorp will pay in the merger is the amount of cash that
would be paid if 40% of the shares of NOVA common stock outstanding on the
record date were exchanged for cash. The cash amount that U.S. Bancorp will pay
in the merger includes any cash paid to dissenters and cash paid in lieu of
fractional shares. The aggregate amount of common stock that U.S. Bancorp will
issue in the merger is limited to 60% of the shares of NOVA common stock
outstanding on the record date, multiplied by the 1.407 stock exchange ratio.

    NOVA's shareholders, as a group, might submit elections to convert more
shares of NOVA common stock into cash, or more shares of NOVA common stock into
U.S. Bancorp common stock, than the limits provided in the merger agreement. If
either type of merger consideration is oversubscribed, then an equitable pro
rata adjustment will be made to ensure that the cash and stock payment limits
are met. For example, if cash is oversubscribed, NOVA shareholders who elected
to receive cash in the merger will receive instead a lesser amount of cash than
they expected and a number of shares of U.S. Bancorp common stock calculated in
accordance with the formula set forth in section 3.01(e) of the merger
agreement. Similarly, if shares of U.S. Bancorp common stock are oversubscribed,
then shareholders who elected to receive U.S. Bancorp common stock will instead
receive a lesser number of shares of U.S. Bancorp common stock than they
expected and an amount of cash calculated in accordance with the formula set
forth in section 3.01(g) of the merger agreement.

    We will attempt to honor your election, and NOVA shares for which no
election has been made will be allocated cash and stock in a manner that allows
U.S. Bancorp to honor the elections of NOVA shareholders who submitted a valid
and timely form of election. However, if there are insufficient "no-election"
shares, it will be necessary to adjust NOVA shareholder elections in some
respect.

    NO FRACTIONAL SHARES

    No fractional shares of U.S. Bancorp common stock will be issued in the
merger. For each fractional share that would otherwise be issued, U.S. Bancorp
will pay an amount in cash (without interest) determined by multiplying the
fraction by the average of the closing sales prices of U.S. Bancorp common stock
(as reported in the WALL STREET JOURNAL or, if not reported in that publication,
in another authoritative source), for the five New York Stock Exchange trading
days immediately preceding the effective date.

    TAX ADJUSTMENT

    The merger is intended to qualify as a "reorganization" within the meaning
of the Internal Revenue Code and, therefore, be tax free to NOVA shareholders to
the extent they receive shares of U.S. Bancorp common stock in the transaction.
Under the Internal Revenue Code, however, the merger might not be a
reorganization if, at the effective time of the merger, the total value of the
shares of U.S. Bancorp common stock that NOVA shareholders receive does not
represent 50% or more of the fair market value of the total consideration as of
the effective time--including shares of U.S. Bancorp common stock, cash and any
other amounts treated as consideration in connection with the merger for
purposes of the Internal Revenue Code--that NOVA's shareholders receive in
connection with the merger. To prevent this from happening, if the value of the
shares of U.S. Bancorp common stock received would otherwise be less than 50% of
the value of the total consideration, U.S. Bancorp may, but is not required to,
either increase the number of shares of U.S. Bancorp common stock to be issued
in the merger or increase the percentage of the outstanding shares of NOVA
common stock that will be converted into U.S. Bancorp common stock and decrease
the percentage of the outstanding shares of NOVA common stock that will be
converted into cash.

    For this condition to occur, the closing price of U.S. Bancorp common stock
on the New York Stock Exchange on the last trading day before the closing of the
merger must be less than $15.50 per share. Under the merger agreement, however,
if the average of the daily closing prices during any period of 10 trading days
is less than $15.50, NOVA has a right to terminate the merger agreement unless
U.S. Bancorp agrees to adjust the exchange ratio so that NOVA shareholders
receive total stock consideration per NOVA share of a value equal to or greater
than $21.80.

ELECTION PROCEDURES; EXCHANGE AGENT

    FORM OF ELECTION

    A form of election is being mailed to you separately. All elections must be
made on the form of election. To be effective, a form of election must be:

    - properly completed, signed and submitted to the exchange agent, Firstar
      Bank, N.A., at the address specified on the form of election;

    - accompanied by the NOVA stock certificates as to which the election is
      being made (if your shares are held in book-entry form, you need only
      submit the form of election, or follow any instructions provided by your
      broker); and

    - received by the exchange agent before 5:00 p.m., Eastern Daylight Time on
      July 24, 2001.

    The form of election contains instructions on how to complete it and how to
submit it to the exchange agent. Forms of election may be revoked in writing,
and new forms of election may be submitted, so long as the written revocation
and the new election are received by the exchange agent prior to 5:00 p.m.
Eastern Daylight Time on July 24, 2001. Where necessary, you also may need to
complete a notice of guaranteed delivery, as directed in the form of election.

    U.S. Bancorp has the discretion to determine whether you have properly
completed, signed and submitted (or revoked) a form of election and to disregard
immaterial defects in the form of election. U.S. Bancorp may delegate this right
to the exchange agent. The exchange agent will make all computations in respect
of the conversion of shares of NOVA common stock into cash and shares of U.S.
Bancorp common stock, and all these computations will be conclusive and binding
on NOVA shareholders.

    If your shares of NOVA stock are held by a bank or by a broker in "street
name," you must contact the bank or broker to determine how to submit your
shares to the exchange agent. If a stock certificate representing your NOVA
shares has been lost, stolen or destroyed, you may still complete an election if
you provide the exchange agent with appropriate evidence as to the loss and
appropriate evidence as to your ownership of the certificate. An indemnity
reasonable to U.S. Bancorp may also be required.

    If you dissent from the merger but also submit a form of election, the form
of election will be invalid and will be rejected. If you initially dissent from
the merger but change your mind prior to the election deadline and you do not
submit a valid form of election prior to the election deadline, then each share
of NOVA common stock you hold will be treated as a share for which you have
indicated no preference as to the receipt of cash or U.S. Bancorp common stock.

    DELIVERY OF MERGER CONSIDERATION

    At or prior to the effective time, U.S. Bancorp will deposit the merger
consideration with the exchange agent. If you have submitted a valid form of
election, then promptly after the effective time, the exchange agent will send
you your share of the merger consideration.

    FAILURE TO SUBMIT AN ELECTION

    If you submit an untimely or improperly completed form of election or do not
submit any form of election, you will be deemed not to have made an election. In
either case, you will have no choice over the type of consideration that you
receive in the merger. Instead, U.S. Bancorp will determine whether to exchange
your shares for cash, shares of U.S. Bancorp common stock or a combination of
the two.

    Promptly after the effective time, the exchange agent will send a form
letter of transmittal to those NOVA shareholders of record immediately prior to
the effective date who were deemed not to have made an election. These
shareholders will be instructed to complete the letter of transmittal and to
mail it, accompanied by certificates they hold formerly representing their NOVA
common stock to the exchange agent. If your shares are held in book-entry form,
you need only submit the form of election, or follow any instructions provided
by your broker. If you failed to make a valid and timely election, then until
your completed letter of transmittal has been received by the exchange agent and
all certificates representing NOVA common stock have been surrendered for
exchange, you will accrue but will not be paid dividends or other distributions
declared after the effective time of the merger with respect to any shares of
U.S. Bancorp common stock into which your shares have been converted. When the
letter of transmittal has been received by the exchange agent and any and all
stock certificates you hold have been surrendered for exchange (if your shares
are held in book-entry form, you need only submit the form of election, or
follow any instructions provided by your broker), then the exchange agent will
send you your merger consideration, and any unpaid dividends or other
distributions will be paid, without interest. After the effective time of the
merger, there will be no

transfers on NOVA's stock transfer books of shares of NOVA common stock issued
and outstanding immediately prior to the effective time.

    If any shares of NOVA common stock are not surrendered or the consideration
for them is not claimed prior to the date on which the consideration would
otherwise escheat to or become the property of any governmental unit or agency,
the unclaimed consideration will, to the extent permitted by abandoned property
and any other applicable law, become the property of U.S. Bancorp (and to the
extent not in its possession will be paid over to U.S. Bancorp), and thereafter
any NOVA shareholders who have not surrendered their NOVA shares by submitting a
letter of transmittal and any common stock certificates they hold will look only
to U.S. Bancorp for payment of the merger consideration and unpaid dividends and
distributions on U.S. Bancorp common stock (all without interest) deliverable in
respect of shares of NOVA common stock. Notwithstanding the above, none of U.S.
Bancorp, NOVA, the exchange agent or any other person will be liable to any
former NOVA shareholder for any amount properly delivered to a public official
pursuant to applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar laws.

TREATMENT OF OPTIONS AND WARRANTS

    At the effective time, each outstanding option to purchase shares of NOVA
common stock outstanding immediately prior to the effective time under any NOVA
stock option plan and each warrant to purchase shares of NOVA common stock will
be converted into an option or warrant to acquire, on the same terms and
conditions as were applicable under the relevant NOVA stock option or stock
warrant, the number of shares of U.S. Bancorp common stock equal to (a) the
number of shares of NOVA common stock subject to the NOVA stock option or NOVA
stock warrant, multiplied by (b) 1.407 (with the product rounded up (or down, as
necessary for an "incentive stock option" as described below) to the nearest
whole number), at an exercise price per share (rounded up or down to the nearest
whole cent) equal to the exercise price per share for the shares of NOVA common
stock that were purchasable pursuant to the NOVA stock option or stock warrant,
divided by the 1.407 stock exchange ratio. Notwithstanding the foregoing, each
NOVA stock option that is intended to be an "incentive stock option" (as defined
in Section 422 of the Internal Revenue Code) will be adjusted in accordance with
the requirements of Section 424 of the Internal Revenue Code.

ANTIDILUTION ADJUSTMENTS

    If, prior to the effective time of the merger, the number of outstanding
shares of NOVA common stock or U.S. Bancorp common stock is changed as a result
of a stock split, reorganization, recapitalization, reclassification,
combination, stock dividend, exchange of shares, reverse stock split or other
similar changes in capitalization, or either NOVA or U.S. Bancorp declares a
stock dividend or extraordinary cash dividend, then an appropriate and
proportionate adjustment will be made to the 1.407 stock exchange ratio.

MATERIAL FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSEQUENCES

    The following discussion describes the federal income tax consequences of
the merger that are material to you as a NOVA shareholder. This discussion
applies only to NOVA shareholders who hold their shares of NOVA common stock as
capital assets. This discussion does not address the particular facts and
circumstances of the tax situation of each NOVA shareholder and does not discuss
all of the consequences that may be relevant to NOVA shareholders entitled to
special treatment under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (such as
insurance companies, financial institutions, dealers in securities, exempt
organizations or foreign persons) or to NOVA shareholders who are subject to the
alternative minimum tax or who acquired their NOVA common stock pursuant to the
exercise of employee stock options or otherwise as compensation. Furthermore,
this discussion does not address the availability to NOVA shareholders who are
corporations of the dividends received

deduction or the "extraordinary dividend" provisions of the Code. Additionally,
no information is provided in this description with respect to the tax
consequences of the merger under estate, gift, state, local, foreign or other
tax laws.

    We have based this discussion on current provisions of the Internal Revenue
Code, final and temporary Treasury Regulations issued under the Internal Revenue
Code, and current administrative rulings and practice, and court decisions. All
of these sources are subject to change, possibly on a retroactive basis, and any
change could affect the continuing validity of this discussion.

    THE PARTICULAR TAX ATTRIBUTES OF EACH NOVA SHAREHOLDER WILL VARY. THE TAX
CONSEQUENCES OF THE MERGER TO EACH NOVA SHAREHOLDER WILL ALSO VARY, DEPENDING
UPON WHETHER YOU RECEIVE SOLELY U.S. BANCORP COMMON STOCK, A COMBINATION OF CASH
AND U.S. BANCORP COMMON STOCK, OR SOLELY CASH. CONSEQUENTLY, WE URGE YOU TO
CONSULT YOUR OWN TAX ADVISOR AS TO THE SPECIFIC TAX CONSEQUENCES OF THE MERGER,
INCLUDING THE APPLICATION AND EFFECT OF ANY STATE, LOCAL, AND FOREIGN TAX LAWS.

    GENERAL

    The Internal Revenue Service has not been and will not be asked to
rule upon the tax consequences of the merger. Instead, NOVA will receive an
opinion from its counsel, Long Aldridge & Norman LLP, and U.S. Bancorp will
receive an opinion from its counsel, Dorsey & Whitney LLP, each dated as of the
effective time of the merger, substantially to the effect that, in addition to
other matters:

    - the merger will be treated for federal income tax purposes as a
      reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code;

    - NOVA and U.S. Bancorp will each be a party to the reorganization within
      the meaning of Section 368(b) of the Code; and

    - NOVA and U.S. Bancorp will not recognize gain or loss as a result of the
      merger.

Accordingly:

    - no gain or loss will be recognized by NOVA shareholders who exchange their
      NOVA common stock solely for U.S. Bancorp common stock pursuant to the
      merger (except with respect to cash received in lieu of a fractional share
      interest in U.S. Bancorp common stock);

    - the tax basis of the U.S. Bancorp common stock received by NOVA
      shareholders who exchange all of their NOVA common stock solely for U.S.
      Bancorp common stock in the merger will be the same as the tax basis of
      NOVA common stock surrendered in exchange therefor (reduced by the tax
      basis allocable to any fractional shares of U.S. Bancorp common stock
      received in the merger); and

    - the holding period of the U.S. Bancorp common stock received by a NOVA
      shareholder pursuant to the merger will include the period during which
      NOVA common stock surrendered therefor was held.

    The opinions of Long Aldridge & Norman LLP and Dorsey & Whitney LLP will be
based upon the facts described in this description, certain assumptions and upon
representations made by NOVA and U.S. Bancorp and are subject to the
limitations, qualifications and assumptions referred to in this proxy
statement/prospectus and in the opinions. The opinions of Long Aldridge &
Norman LLP and Dorsey & Whitney LLP will also be based upon the Internal Revenue
Code, Treasury Regulations now in effect, current administrative rulings and
practice, and court decisions, all of which are subject to change. An opinion of
counsel is not binding on the Internal Revenue Service and there can be no
assurance, and none is hereby given, that the Internal Revenue Service will not
take a position contrary to one or more positions reflected herein in this
description or that the opinion will be upheld by the courts if challenged by
the Internal Revenue Service.

    AGGREGATE MERGER CONSIDERATION

    The foregoing discussion assumes that, on the closing date of the merger,
the total value of U.S. Bancorp common stock that NOVA shareholders receive
represents at least 50% of the value of the total merger consideration. Between
now and the closing date of the merger, the value of U.S. Bancorp's common could
decrease. If it decreases such that, based on the closing price on the last
trading day prior to the date the merger would be completed, the total value of
U.S. Bancorp common stock that NOVA shareholders receive does not represent at
least 50% of the value of the total merger consideration, then under the terms
of the merger agreement, U.S. Bancorp has the option to either:

    - increase the number of shares of U.S. Bancorp common stock to be issued in
      the merger on a proportionate basis, or

    - increase the number of shares of NOVA common stock to be converted into
      shares of U.S. Bancorp common stock and decrease the number of shares of
      NOVA common stock to be converted into cash,

in either case such that the total cash consideration would not exceed 50% of
the value of the total merger consideration. If U.S. Bancorp does not exercise
either option and the merger is nonetheless completed, the merger may be taxable
to NOVA shareholders. YOU ARE STRONGLY URGED TO CONSULT YOUR OWN TAX AND
FINANCIAL ADVISERS REGARDING THE EFFECT OF THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED BY THIS
PARAGRAPH.

    NOVA SHAREHOLDERS WHO RECEIVE SOLELY U.S. BANCORP COMMON STOCK IN EXCHANGE
     FOR NOVA COMMON STOCK

    A NOVA shareholder who exchanges shares of NOVA common stock solely for
shares of U.S. Bancorp common stock will not recognize any gain or loss on the
exchange, except to the extent the shareholder receives cash in lieu of
fractional shares of U.S. Bancorp common stock (as discussed below). The
aggregate adjusted tax basis of the shares of U.S. Bancorp common stock received
by the NOVA shareholder in the merger will be the shareholder's aggregate
adjusted tax basis in the shares of NOVA common stock surrendered in the merger
(reduced by the tax basis allocable to any fractional shares of U.S. Bancorp
common stock with respect to which cash was received by the NOVA shareholder).
The holding period of the U.S. Bancorp common stock received in the merger will
include the period during which the shareholder held the shares of NOVA common
stock that were surrendered in exchange for the U.S. Bancorp common stock.

    NOVA SHAREHOLDERS WHO RECEIVE A COMBINATION OF U.S. BANCORP COMMON STOCK AND
     CASH IN EXCHANGE FOR NOVA COMMON STOCK

    If a NOVA shareholder realizes a loss upon the exchange of NOVA common stock
for a combination of cash and U.S. Bancorp common stock, the shareholder cannot
recognize the loss, except for any loss attributable to any cash received
instead of a fractional share of U.S. Bancorp common stock as discussed below.
If a NOVA shareholder realizes any gain, he or she will recognize that gain in
an amount equal to the lesser of:

    - the amount of cash received by the shareholder; and

    - the amount of gain realized by the shareholder, except that cash received
      instead of a fractional share of U.S. Bancorp common stock will be treated
      as discussed below.

The gain or loss realized equals the difference between the sum of cash and fair
market value of U.S. Bancorp common stock received by the NOVA shareholder and
the shareholder's tax basis in the NOVA common stock that the shareholder
surrendered in the merger.

    The character of the gain recognized depends on the particular facts and
circumstances relating to each NOVA shareholder. Any gain that the shareholder
recognizes as a result of the receipt of cash may be characterized as capital
gain. This capital gain will be long-term capital gain if the holding period for
the shares of NOVA common stock that are surrendered in the merger is greater
than one year as of the effective time of the merger. However, the gain that a
shareholder recognizes as a result of the receipt of cash may be treated as a
dividend distribution if the receipt of the cash is treated as having, for
federal income tax purposes, the effect of the distribution of a dividend. If
any portion of the distribution is taxable as a dividend to a corporate
shareholder, it may qualify for the "dividends received deduction." This
dividend may, however, be subject to the "extraordinary dividend" provisions of
the Internal Revenue Code.

    To determine whether gain is capital gain or a dividend distribution, the
Internal Revenue Service deems a redemption to occur under which a NOVA
shareholder that receives a combination of cash and U.S. Bancorp common stock is
treated as hypothetically:

    - receiving solely shares of U.S. Bancorp common stock in exchange for all
      of the shareholder's NOVA common stock; and

    - having U.S. Bancorp redeem a portion of those shares of U.S. Bancorp
      common stock equal in amount to the cash that the shareholder actually
      received in the merger.

This is called a "deemed redemption." Under this analysis, in general, if the
receipt of cash by the holder in the deemed redemption results in a
"substantially disproportionate" reduction in the holder's voting stock interest
in U.S. Bancorp or is "not essentially equivalent to a dividend," the receipt of
the cash will not have the effect of the distribution of a dividend. In applying
this deemed redemption analysis, particular constructive ownership rules apply
in determining a NOVA shareholder's ownership interest in U.S. Bancorp
immediately after the merger but before the deemed redemption, and after the
deemed redemption. Under those rules, a NOVA shareholder is deemed to own stock
held by specific family members, estates and trusts of which the shareholder is
a beneficiary, a partnership in which the shareholder is a partner, and a
corporation in which the shareholder is a direct or indirect 50% shareholder, as
well as stock subject to options that are held by the shareholder or the
entities in which the shareholder owns an interest. Because these constructive
ownership rules are complex, each NOVA shareholder who believes that he or she
may be subject to these rules should consult his or her tax advisor.

    The deemed redemption will be "substantially disproportionate" with respect
to a NOVA shareholder if:

    - the percentage of the total combined voting power of all classes of
      outstanding voting stock of U.S. Bancorp the shareholder owns immediately
      after the deemed redemption is less than 50%; and

    - the percentage of the value and the voting stock of U.S. Bancorp the
      shareholder owns immediately after the hypothetical redemption is less
      than 80% of the percentage of the value and the voting stock of U.S.
      Bancorp that the shareholder is deemed to own immediately before the
      deemed redemption.

For example, a NOVA shareholder who receives a combination of cash and U.S.
Bancorp stock in the merger, and who would have owned 5% of the outstanding
stock of U.S. Bancorp had he or she received solely stock in the merger,
generally is expected to satisfy the "substantially disproportionate" test if
the shareholder owns less than 4% of the outstanding stock of U.S. Bancorp after
the merger.

    If the deemed redemption from a NOVA shareholder fails to satisfy the
"substantially disproportionate" test, a shareholder may still be treated as
receiving capital gain by satisfying the "not essentially equivalent to a
dividend" test. A payment to a NOVA shareholder will satisfy the "not

essentially equivalent to a dividend" test if it results in a "meaningful
reduction" in that shareholder's proportionate stock interest in U.S. Bancorp.
If a shareholder with a relatively minimal stock interest in U.S. Bancorp and no
right to exercise control over corporate affairs reduces his or her
proportionate interest in U.S. Bancorp as a result of the deemed redemption, the
Internal Revenue Service should regard that shareholder as having meaningfully
reduced his or her interest in U.S. Bancorp. For example, the Internal Revenue
Service has held in a published ruling that in the case of a less-than-1%
shareholder who does not have management control over the corporation, any
reduction in proportionate interest will constitute a "meaningful reduction."

    Because the typical holder of shares of NOVA common stock is a less-than-1%
shareholder, if that holder:

    - undergoes a reduction in his or her proportionate stock interest in U.S.
      Bancorp,

    - does not own any U.S. Bancorp common stock other than that actually
      received or deemed to have been received in the merger, and

    - is not considered to own any stock attributed to the shareholder under the
      constructive ownership rules,

then the gain that the shareholder recognizes as the result of the receipt of
cash is generally expected to be characterized as capital gain.

    However, the deemed redemption tests that we describe above and the
application of the constructive ownership rules are complex and will depend upon
each NOVA shareholder's particular facts and circumstances. If you elect to
receive a portion of the merger consideration as cash, we urge you to consult
your tax advisor to determine the character of any gain that you may recognize
as a result of the merger.

    The aggregate tax basis of the U.S. Bancorp common stock received by a NOVA
shareholder who exchanges his or her shares of NOVA common stock for a
combination of U.S. Bancorp common stock and cash in the merger will be the same
as the aggregate tax basis of the NOVA common stock that the shareholder
surrendered in the merger, less any portion of such basis allocable to any
fractional share interest of U.S. Bancorp common stock for which the shareholder
received cash, decreased by the amount of cash received, and increased by the
amount of gain recognized, including any portion of the gain that is treated as
a dividend. The holding period of the U.S. Bancorp common stock received will
include the holding period of the shares of NOVA common stock surrendered in
exchange for the U.S. Bancorp common stock.

    NOVA SHAREHOLDERS WHO RECEIVE SOLELY CASH

    A NOVA shareholder who exchanges all of his or her shares of NOVA common
stock solely for cash and who owns no shares of U.S. Bancorp common stock either
actually or constructively after the merger will generally recognize gain or
loss equal to the difference between the amount of cash received and the
shareholder's adjusted tax basis of the shares of NOVA common stock surrendered
in the merger. Any gain or loss generally will be treated as capital gain or
loss, and generally will be long-term capital gain or loss if the holding period
of the shares is greater than one year as of the effective time of the merger.
If, however, the NOVA shareholder either actually or constructively owns any
shares of U.S. Bancorp common stock following the merger, the cash received by
the NOVA shareholder may be treated as a dividend distribution. The
determination of whether a shareholder constructively owns any shares of U.S.
Bancorp common stock is based on the constructive ownership rules discussed
above. Because these constructive ownership rules are complex, if a NOVA
shareholder believes that he or she may be subject to these rules, the
shareholder should consult his or her tax advisor.

    CASH RECEIVED IN LIEU OF FRACTIONAL SHARES

    A NOVA shareholder who receives cash instead of a fractional share of U.S.
Bancorp common stock will be treated as having first received the fractional
share of U.S. Bancorp common stock in the merger and then as having received
cash in exchange for the fractional share interest. Consequently, the NOVA
shareholder generally will recognize gain or loss in an amount equal to the
difference between the amount of cash received instead of the fractional share
of U.S. Bancorp common stock and the portion of the adjusted tax basis of the
shareholder's shares of NOVA common stock that are allocable to the fractional
share of U.S. Bancorp common stock. The gain or loss will constitute capital
gain or loss, and generally will be long-term capital gain or loss if the
holding period for the shares was greater than one year as of the effective time
of the merger.

    NOVA SHAREHOLDER REPORTING REQUIREMENTS

    A NOVA shareholder who exchanges NOVA common stock for U.S. Bancorp common
stock or exchanges NOVA common stock for a combination of U.S. Bancorp common
stock and cash in connection with the merger will be required to retain records
and file with that shareholder's federal income tax return for the taxable year
in which the merger takes place a statement setting forth all relevant facts in
respect of the nonrecognition of gain or loss upon the exchange. The statement
must include:

    - the shareholder's basis in the shares of NOVA common stock surrendered in
      the merger;

    - the value of the shares of U.S. Bancorp common stock received, using fair
      market value as of the effective time of the merger; and

    - the amount of any cash received in the merger.

    BACKUP WITHHOLDING

    Under the Internal Revenue Code, a NOVA shareholder may be subject, under
some circumstances, to backup withholding at a 31% rate with respect to the
amount of consideration received in connection with the merger unless the holder
provides proof of an applicable exemption or a correct taxpayer identification
number and otherwise complies with applicable requirements of the backup
withholding rules. Any amounts withheld under the backup withholding rules are
not an additional tax and may be refunded or credited against the holder's
federal income tax liability, if the required information is furnished to the
Internal Revenue Service.

ACCOUNTING TREATMENT

    The merger will be accounted for by U.S. Bancorp under the purchase method
of accounting in accordance with Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 16,
"Business Combinations," as amended.

    Under this method of accounting, the purchase price will be allocated to
assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their fair market values at the
date of the acquisition. The income statement of the combined company will not
include the operations of NOVA prior to the effective date of the merger.

during and after their employment with U.S. Bancorp, including requirements that
the officers keep confidential the confidential information of NOVA and U.S.
Bancorp and that the officers not solicit U.S. Bancorp customers or employees.
The non-competition provisions prevent the officers from competing with the
merchant credit card processing business of U.S. Bancorp for a period of time
following termination of employment with U.S. Bancorp.

INDEMNIFICATION OF NOVA'S DIRECTORS AND OFFICERS BY U.S. BANCORP

    U.S. Bancorp has agreed to indemnify and hold harmless all present and
former NOVA directors and officers against costs and expenses incurred in
connection with any actual or threatened claim or proceeding arising out of
matters existing or occurring at or prior to the completion of the merger, to
the fullest extent permitted by law. U.S. Bancorp has also agreed, for a period
of six years after the effective date, to provide insurance for NOVA's officers
and directors with respect to claims against those officers and directors
arising from facts or events that occurred on or before the completion of the
merger. However, U.S. Bancorp is required to spend no more than 300% per annum
of the current amount spent by NOVA to maintain directors' and officers'
insurance coverage.

STOCK EXCHANGE LISTING

    U.S. Bancorp has agreed to use its reasonable best efforts to list, prior to
the completion of the merger, on the New York Stock Exchange, the shares of U.S.
Bancorp common stock to be issued in the merger other than any shares to be
issued out of U.S. Bancorp's treasury for which such listing is not required.

RESTRICTIONS ON RESALES BY AFFILIATES

    The issuance of shares of U.S. Bancorp common stock to NOVA shareholders in
the merger has been registered under the Securities Act. The shares of U.S.
Bancorp common stock exchanged in the merger may be traded freely and without
restriction by those shareholders not deemed to be "affiliates" of NOVA (as that
term is defined under the Securities Act). An "affiliate" of NOVA, as defined by
the rules promulgated pursuant to the Securities Act, is a person who directly,
or indirectly through one or more intermediaries, controls, is controlled by or
is under common control with, NOVA. Any subsequent transfer of the shares by any
person who is an affiliate of NOVA at the time the merger is submitted for a
vote of the holders of NOVA common stock will, under existing law, require
either:

    - the further registration under the Securities Act of the shares of U.S.
      Bancorp common stock to be transferred, or

    - compliance with Rule 145 under the Securities Act (permitting sales during
      a three-month period of the greater of (a) one percent of the total U.S.
      Bancorp shares outstanding and (b) the average weekly reported volume of
      trading in U.S. Bancorp securities during the four calendar weeks
      preceding the affiliate's filing of a Form 144 (if required), assuming
      U.S. Bancorp is current in filing required reports and the securities are
      being sold in brokers' transactions), or

    - the availability of another exemption from registration.

    These restrictions are expected to apply to the directors and executive
officers of NOVA and the holders of 10% or more of the NOVA common stock (and to
specified relatives or the spouse of the person and any trusts, estates,
corporations or other entities in which the person has a 10% or greater
beneficial or equity interest).

    Stop transfer instructions will be given by U.S. Bancorp to the transfer
agent with respect to the U.S. Bancorp common stock to be received by persons
subject to the restrictions described above, and the certificates for this stock
will be appropriately legended. NOVA has agreed in the merger agreement to use
its reasonable best efforts to cause each director, executive officer and other
person who is an affiliate (for purposes of Rule 145 of the Securities Act) of
NOVA to deliver to U.S. Bancorp a written agreement intended to ensure
compliance with the Securities Act.

CONDITIONS TO COMPLETION OF THE MERGER

    CONDITIONS TO EACH PARTY'S OBLIGATION TO EFFECT THE MERGER

    The respective obligation of each of U.S. Bancorp and NOVA to complete the
merger is subject to the fulfillment or written waiver by U.S. Bancorp and NOVA
prior to the effective time of each of the following conditions:

    - the merger must be approved by NOVA's shareholders;

    - all necessary governmental approvals must be obtained, including
      termination of applicable statutory waiting periods;

    - no judgment, order, injunction, statute or rule may be in effect that
      would prevent the merger;

    - the U.S. Bancorp common stock to be issued in the merger will have been
      registered under the Securities Act and approved for listing on the New
      York Stock Exchange;

    - all material permits and other authorizations under state securities laws
      necessary to complete the merger and to issue the shares of U.S. Bancorp

    - no proceeding by a governmental entity seeking to prevent the merger shall
      be pending.

    CONDITIONS TO OBLIGATION OF NOVA

    The obligation of NOVA to complete the merger is also subject to the
fulfillment or written waiver by NOVA prior to the effective time of each of the
following conditions:

    - the representations and warranties of U.S. Bancorp in the merger agreement
      must continue to be true and correct in all material respects except for
      those representations and warranties that speak as of a specific date;

    - U.S. Bancorp must comply in all material respects with its obligations in
      the merger agreement;

    - NOVA must receive an opinion of its tax counsel to the effect the merger
      will qualify as a tax-free reorganization as described under "--Material
      Federal Income Tax Consequences"; and

    - no material adverse change in U.S. Bancorp's business must occur that
      would have a material adverse effect on U.S. Bancorp and its subsidiaries
      as a whole.

    CONDITIONS TO OBLIGATION OF U.S. BANCORP

    The obligation of U.S. Bancorp to complete the merger is also subject to the
fulfillment or written waiver by U.S. Bancorp prior to the effective time of
each of the following conditions:

    - the representations and warranties of NOVA in the merger agreement must
      continue to be true and correct in all material respects except for those
      representations and warranties that speak as of a specific date;

    - NOVA must comply in all material respects with its obligations in the
      merger agreement;

    - U.S. Bancorp must receive an opinion of its tax counsel to the effect the
      merger will qualify as a tax-free reorganization as described under
      "--Material Federal Income Tax Consequences";

    - no material adverse change in NOVA's business must occur that would have a
      material adverse effect on NOVA and its subsidiaries as a whole; and

    - shareholders who have indicated their intent to exercise dissenters'
      rights under Georgia law as of the date of NOVA's special meeting of
      shareholders must hold, in the aggregate, no more than 40% of NOVA's
      common stock.

    OBLIGATION OF NOVA AND U.S. BANCORP TO DELIVER TAX OPINION

    The requirement that each of NOVA and U.S. Bancorp receive a legal opinion
that the merger will qualify as a reorganization under Section 368(a) of the
Internal Revenue Code will no longer apply if:

    - the value of U.S. Bancorp common stock decreases so that, based on the
      closing price on the last trading day prior to the date the merger would
      be completed, the value of U.S. Bancorp common stock to be issued to NOVA
      shareholders in the merger no longer equals or exceeds 50% of the total
      merger consideration to be issued to NOVA shareholders, and

    - U.S. Bancorp does not exercise its option either to increase the number of
      shares of U.S. Bancorp common stock to be issued in the merger on a
      proportionate basis, or to increase the number of shares of NOVA common
      stock to be converted into shares of U.S. Bancorp common stock (and
      decrease the number of shares of NOVA common stock to be converted into
      cash), in either case such that the value of U.S. Bancorp common stock to
      be issued to NOVA shareholders in the merger equals or exceeds 50% of the
      total merger consideration.

However, if the average of the daily closing prices of a share of U.S. Bancorp
common stock (as reported on the consolidated tape of the New York Stock
Exchange) during any period of 10 consecutive trading days after the date of the
merger agreement is less than $15.50, NOVA has a right to terminate the merger
agreement unless U.S. Bancorp agrees to adjust the exchange ratio in such a
manner as to provide the shareholders of NOVA with stock consideration per share
of NOVA common stock with a value greater than or equal to $21.80, which
represents total merger consideration--cash and stock--per share of NOVA common
stock with a value greater than or equal to approximately $25.485; in this
event, U.S. Bancorp may not eliminate the delivery of tax opinions as a
condition to completion of the merger.

REGULATORY APPROVALS REQUIRED FOR THE MERGER

    NOVA and U.S. Bancorp and their respective subsidiaries will use their
reasonable best efforts to do all things necessary or desirable to complete the
merger as soon as practicable. In addition, they each will provide each other
with truthful information in various governmental filings and promptly will
correct any material omission with respect to such information. Each party may
review and consult with the other party regarding all written information
submitted to any third party or governmental authority in connection with the
merger. In addition, each party will consult with the other party with respect
to obtaining all material consents and approvals of third parties and
governmental authorities, and each party will keep the other party informed of
the status of material matters relating to completion of the merger.

    The merger is subject to the requirements of the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust
Improvements Act of 1976, as amended, which prevents certain acquisitions from
being completed until required information and materials are furnished to the
Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice and the Federal Trade Commission
and certain waiting periods expire. We expect that the applicable waiting
periods will expire at 11:59 p.m. on July 11, 2001, unless extended by a second
request for information.

    The Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice or the Federal Trade
Commission may challenge the merger on antitrust grounds either before or after
expiration of the waiting period. Private parties could take action under the
antitrust laws, including seeking divestiture, damages or enjoinment of the
merger. Additionally, at any time before or after the completion of the merger,
notwithstanding expiration or termination of the applicable waiting period, any
state could take action under its antitrust laws as it deems necessary or
desirable in the public interest. Although we do not believe that the merger
would violate any applicable antitrust laws, there can be no assurance that a
challenge to the merger will not be made or that, if a challenge is made, we
will prevail.

    Although U.S. Bancorp, as a financial holding company, is subject to
extensive regulation by banking regulatory authorities such as the Office of the
Comptroller of the Currency and the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve
System, U.S. Bancorp does not believe the merger requires the approval of any
banking regulatory authority. If any such approvals are needed, NOVA and U.S.
Bancorp will seek to obtain them. There is no assurance, however, that any of
these approvals or actions, if needed, will be obtained.

    Neither of us is aware of any other material governmental or regulatory
approval required for completion of the merger.

    STATUS OF REGULATORY APPROVALS AND OTHER INFORMATION

    NOVA and U.S. Bancorp have filed all applications and notices and have taken
(or will promptly take) other appropriate action to obtain all necessary
governmental approvals.

    The representations and warranties in the merger agreement are complicated
and not easily summarized. You are urged to carefully read the sections in the
merger agreement titled "Representations and Warranties of the Company" and
"Representations and Warranties of Acquirer."

CONDUCT OF BUSINESS PENDING THE MERGER AND OTHER MERGER AGREEMENTS

    Pursuant to the merger agreement, prior to the effective time, each of U.S.
Bancorp and NOVA has agreed not to:

    - take any action that it knows would materially adversely affect or delay
      its ability to perform any of its obligations under the merger agreement;

    - take any action that would be reasonably likely to prevent the merger from
      qualifying as a reorganization within the meaning of Section 368 of the
      Code; or

    - knowingly take any action that is intended or is reasonably likely to
      result in:

    (1) any of its respective representations and warranties in the merger
       agreement becoming untrue in any material respect,

    (2) any of the conditions of the merger not being satisfied, or

    (3) a material violation of the merger agreement,

except, in each case, as required by law.

    NOVA agreed that, until termination of the merger agreement or the
completion of the merger or unless U.S. Bancorp consents in writing, NOVA and
each of its subsidiaries will operate their business in the ordinary and usual
course, consistent with past practices. NOVA has agreed, except as required by
applicable law and except as otherwise provided in the merger agreement not to:

    - except as previously disclosed to U.S. Bancorp, issue or agree to issue
      shares of its capital stock or subject shares of capital stock to new
      option grants or other rights;

    - take, declare, pay or set aside for payment any dividend or other
      distribution on its capital stock;

    - except as previously disclosed to U.S. Bancorp, enter into, renew or amend
      its employment agreements except in the ordinary course of business, as
      required by law, to satisfy previously disclosed contractual obligations
      or for grants of awards to newly hired employees consistent with past
      practice;

    - enter into, adopt or modify its employee benefit plans (except to satisfy
      previously disclosed contractual obligations or as required by law) or
      take any action to accelerate the vesting of any stock option or other
      benefits payable under its benefits plans;

    - dispose of or discontinue any of its assets, business or properties,
      except in the ordinary course of business;

    - acquire, or agree to acquire, the assets, business or properties, of any
      other entity except in the ordinary course of business and in a
      transaction that is not material to NOVA and its subsidiaries, taken as a
      whole;

    - except as previously disclosed to U.S. Bancorp, make any capital
      expenditures out of the ordinary course of business or over $100,000
      individually or $1,000,000 in the aggregate;

    - amend its articles of incorporation or bylaws;

    - implement or adopt any change in its financial accounting policies,
      practices or methods, other than as may be required by accounting
      principles generally accepted in the United States;

    - enter into, terminate or renew or amend any material contract, except in
      the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice;

    - other than indebtedness incurred under NOVA's existing line of credit,
      incur any indebtedness for borrowed money in an aggregate amount exceeding
      $5,000,000 or voluntarily incur or become subject to any material
      liability, other than those within the ordinary course of business;

    - discharge any material lien or encumbrances on NOVA's or its subsidiaries'
      material properties or assets or pay or cancel any material debt, except
      in the ordinary course of business;

    - fail to maintain its current insurance policies or replace them without
      providing substantially equal coverage;

    - enter into any settlement in excess of $500,000 with respect to any
      proceeding to which NOVA or its subsidiaries became a party after the date
      of the merger agreement; or

    - agree or commit to do any of the above.

    The agreements related to NOVA's business in the merger agreement are
complicated and not easily summarized. You are urged to carefully read the
section in the merger agreement titled "Actions Pending Acquisition."

LIMITATION ON ACQUISITION PROPOSALS

    NOVA has agreed not to, and to cause its subsidiaries and its subsidiaries'
officers, directors, agents, advisors and affiliates not to, solicit or
encourage inquiries regarding, or provide confidential information for, or
engage in any negotiations concerning, any proposal for a takeover proposal, as
defined in the merger agreement, of NOVA by a party other than U.S. Bancorp.
However, if NOVA's board determines in good faith after considering advice of
outside counsel, that NOVA has received an unsolicited "superior proposal" (as
defined below), and that the failure to do so would likely result in a breach by
NOVA's board of its fiduciary duties to NOVA's shareholders, then NOVA may, in
response to an unsolicited request for information, furnish information to, and
enter into discussions with, the party making the superior proposal after
signing a customary confidentiality agreement. After receiving a superior
proposal, NOVA's board may modify its approval or recommendation of the merger
agreement after considering advice of outside counsel, if it determines in good
faith that the failure to modify its approval or recommendation would likely be
in breach of its fiduciary duties to NOVA's shareholders. Under the merger
agreement, a "superior proposal" is defined as a bona fide takeover proposal
that in the good faith judgment of a majority of the disinterested members of
NOVA's board (after considering the advice of NOVA's financial advisor that the
financial value of the consideration in the takeover proposal exceeds the
financial value of the consideration in the merger) is financially more
favorable to NOVA's shareholders than the merger and is made by a party
financially capable of completing the takeover proposal. NOVA is required to
inform U.S. Bancorp of any written takeover proposal, its general terms and the
identity of the party making the proposal within 24 hours of receipt. NOVA may
be required to pay U.S. Bancorp a termination fee and, if a takeover proposal is
consummated, NOVA may then also be required to transfer its interest in Elan
Merchant Services, LLC to U.S. Bancorp upon the payment by U.S. Bancorp to NOVA
of $47,585,000. See "--Termination of the Merger Agreement--Effect of
Termination and Abandonment," "--Termination Fee" and "--LLC Buyout Agreement."

TERMINATION OF THE MERGER AGREEMENT

    TERMINATION

    The merger agreement may be terminated by mutual consent, or by either NOVA
or U.S. Bancorp under certain circumstances, at any time before completion of
the merger, as summarized below:

    - if the merger is not completed by December 31, 2001, unless the failure to
      complete the merger by that time is due to a violation of the merger
      agreement by the party that wants to terminate the merger agreement;

    - if a condition of a party's obligation to complete the merger becomes
      impossible to satisfy;

    - if a governmental agency denies an approval needed to complete the merger,
      and that denial has become final and nonappealable; or

    - if NOVA's shareholders do not approve the merger at the special meeting.

    The merger agreement may be terminated by NOVA:

    - if U.S. Bancorp has breached any of its representations and warranties
      resulting in a material adverse effect on U.S. Bancorp or has failed to
      perform in any material respect any of its covenants and does not correct
      the breach within 45 days following receipt of notice of the breach;

    - if NOVA enters into an agreement regarding a takeover proposal that is a
      superior proposal from a financial standpoint and pays the required
      termination fee to U.S. Bancorp; or

    - if the average price of U.S. Bancorp common stock (as reported on the
      consolidated tape of the New York Stock Exchange) for any 10-trading day
      period after May 7, 2001 is less than $15.50, unless U.S. Bancorp elects
      to increase the exchange ratio to provide NOVA shareholders with a stock
      consideration per share of NOVA common stock with a value greater than or
      equal to $21.80.

    The merger agreement may be terminated by U.S. Bancorp:

    - if NOVA has breached any of its representations and warranties resulting
      in a material adverse effect on NOVA or has failed to perform in any
      material respect any of its covenants and does not correct the breach
      within 45 days following receipt of notice of the breach;

    - if NOVA's board has withdrawn, modified or changed, in some way adverse to
      U.S. Bancorp, its recommendation to NOVA's shareholders to approve the
      merger; or

    - if NOVA's board recommends or approves a takeover proposal with another
      party or NOVA enters into an agreement regarding a takeover proposal with
      another party.

    EFFECT OF TERMINATION AND ABANDONMENT

    In general, termination of the merger agreement will relieve each party of
liability except for any termination fee payable to U.S. Bancorp, the possible
applicability of the LLC Buyout Agreement discussed below, and liability for a
breach of a confidentiality agreement entered into by the parties. In addition,
termination of the merger agreement will not relieve a breaching party from
liability for any willful breach of the merger agreement giving rise to the
termination.

    TERMINATION FEE

    If the merger agreement is terminated and the merger abandoned under certain
circumstances, NOVA will pay to U.S. Bancorp $65,000,000 as a termination fee.
NOVA would only be required to pay this fee if the merger agreement is
terminated upon the occurrence of any of the following events and conditions:

    - by NOVA or U.S. Bancorp because NOVA enters into any agreement regarding a
      takeover proposal with another party;

    - by U.S. Bancorp because NOVA's board fails to recommend the merger to its
      shareholders, or withdraws, modifies or changes such recommendation in a
      manner adverse to the interests of U.S. Bancorp, or recommends or approves
      another takeover proposal with another party, and NOVA subsequently enters
      into an agreement providing for a takeover proposal;

    - by U.S. Bancorp because NOVA has materially breached any of its
      representations and warranties or has failed to perform in any material
      respect any of its covenants, and the breach has not been cured within
      45 days following receipt of notice of the breach, and if a takeover
      proposal prior to the termination is publicly announced and NOVA completes
      a takeover proposal or enters into an agreement for a takeover proposal
      within 18 months after the date of such termination; or

    - by U.S. Bancorp or NOVA if NOVA's shareholders do not approve the merger,
      and if a takeover proposal prior to the termination is publicly announced
      and NOVA completes a takeover proposal or enters into an agreement for a
      takeover proposal within 18 months after the date of such termination.

    Notwithstanding the foregoing, NOVA is not obligated to pay the termination
fee at any time that it is entitled under the terms of the merger agreement to
terminate the merger agreement because of a

breach by U.S. Bancorp of its representations and warranties or a failure by
U.S. Bancorp to perform its covenants as described in "Termination of the Merger
Agreement--Termination."

    NOVA will pay the termination fee promptly to U.S. Bancorp upon termination
of the merger agreement for the reasons and under the circumstances discussed
above. The payment will relieve NOVA of liability for any breach (other than
willful breaches) of any of NOVA's representations, warranties, covenants or
other agreements contained in the merger agreement.

EXTENSION, WAIVER AND AMENDMENT OF THE MERGER AGREEMENT

    The merger agreement may be amended by U.S. Bancorp and NOVA at any time
before or after the special meeting, except that any amendment made after the
special meeting that would otherwise require approval of NOVA's or U.S.
Bancorp's shareholders under applicable law must be submitted to the
shareholders of NOVA or U.S. Bancorp, as appropriate. Moreover, NOVA and U.S.
Bancorp may not amend the merger agreement after NOVA's shareholders approve the
merger if the amendment (1) reduces or changes the consideration that will be
received by NOVA shareholders or (2) violates the Georgia Business Corporation
Code. All amendments to the merger agreement must be in writing signed by both
NOVA and U.S. Bancorp.

    At any time prior to the completion of the merger, U.S. Bancorp and NOVA
may:

    - extend the time to perform any of the obligations or other acts of the
      other party,

    - waive any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties contained in
      the merger agreement or in any document delivered pursuant to the merger
      agreement, and

    - waive compliance with any of the agreements or conditions contained in the
      merger agreement.

    All extensions and waivers must be in writing.

EXPENSES

    The merger agreement provides that U.S. Bancorp and NOVA will pay their own
expenses in connection with the merger.

LLC BUYOUT AGREEMENT

    Prior to the February 2001 merger of the former U.S. Bancorp with Firstar
Corporation, one of Firstar's banking subsidiaries entered into a joint venture
arrangement with NOVA Information Systems, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of
NOVA. Under the joint venture arrangement, Firstar and NOVA, through their
subsidiaries, established a limited liability company, Elan Merchant Services,
LLC. Firstar and NOVA agreed to establish and operate a merchant transaction
processing business through Elan for an initial 10-year period beginning on
August 31, 1998, subject to one-year automatic renewals after the expiration of
the initial term. NOVA owns a 51% membership interest in Elan, and Firstar owns
a 49% membership interest in Elan. Under the Elan operating agreement, profits
and losses of Elan generally are allocated according to NOVA's and Firstar's
respective membership interests. In connection with the Elan joint venture,
Firstar agreed that, during the term of the joint venture, Firstar would rely
solely on Elan for the operation of a merchant transaction processing business
in the United States.

    As a condition to the execution of the merger agreement, NOVA and U.S.
Bancorp entered into an LLC Buyout Agreement providing that, upon the occurrence
of designated events, NOVA's interest in Elan would transfer to U.S. Bancorp in
exchange for payment by U.S. Bancorp to NOVA of $47,585,000. Specifically, these
designated triggering events are (1) the termination of the merger agreement by
NOVA in connection with NOVA entering into a definitive agreement providing for
a takeover proposal, (2) the termination of the merger agreement by U.S. Bancorp
because (a) NOVA's

board of directors has failed to make, or has withdrawn or modified, its
recommendation to the NOVA shareholders to vote in favor of the merger,
(b) NOVA has entered into an agreement for a takeover proposal or (c) the NOVA
board of directors has resolved to take the actions specified in clauses
(a) and (b), (3) the termination of the merger agreement by either U.S. Bancorp
or NOVA because of a material breach by the other party of its representations,
warranties, covenants or agreements in the merger agreement or (4) the
termination of the merger agreement by either U.S. Bancorp or NOVA because of
the failure of NOVA's shareholders to approve the merger. However, the events
specified in items (3) and (4) are only considered triggering events if, prior
to the termination of the merger agreement, a takeover proposal for NOVA is
publicly announced. In addition, in the case of any of the four triggering
events, the event will only be considered a triggering event if a takeover
proposal is consummated by NOVA within 18 months following the termination of
the merger agreement.

    If one of the triggering events occurs, U.S. Bancorp will have 10 business
days from the date of the consummation of the takeover proposal following the
triggering event to make the required payment to NOVA. Upon receipt of payment,
(1) all of NOVA's right, title and interest in Elan will transfer to U.S.
Bancorp, (2) NOVA will release U.S. Bancorp, Elan and certain related parties,
and U.S. Bancorp and Elan will release NOVA and certain related parties, from
all claims, demands and damages in connection with the joint venture arrangement
that arose prior to the transfer of the interest to U.S. Bancorp, subject to
some limited exceptions, and (3) all rights and obligations of NOVA and U.S.
Bancorp under the joint venture will cease, subject to some limited exceptions.
However, NOVA will continue to process transactions under existing contracts
with designated merchants until the expiration of NOVA's existing processing
contract with Elan or until an earlier date specified by U.S. Bancorp.

    In addition, NOVA has agreed to use reasonable efforts to prevent its direct
sales force from soliciting "restricted merchants" for provision to them by NOVA
of products and services supplied by Elan for a two-year period after the date
on which U.S. Bancorp purchases NOVA's interest in Elan. "Restricted merchants"
are all merchants that have been provided with products and services by Elan at
any time during the period from the date of the LLC Buyout Agreement until the
termination of processing services provided by NOVA to Elan.

directors. Although U.S. Bancorp's board presently intends to continue the

subsidiaries, their financial condition and other factors, including applicable
governmental regulations and policies.

GOVERNMENT POLICIES

    The operations of U.S. Bancorp's various operating units are affected by
state and federal legislative changes and by policies of various regulatory
authorities, including those of the several states in which they operate, the
United States and foreign governments. These policies include, for example,
statutory maximum legal lending rates, domestic monetary policies of the Federal
Reserve Board, United States fiscal policy, international currency regulations
and monetary policies, and capital adequacy and liquidity constraints imposed by
bank regulatory agencies.

SUPERVISION AND REGULATION

    U.S. Bancorp is a registered bank holding company and financial holding
company under the Bank Holding Company Act, or "BHCA," and is subject to the
supervision of, and regulation by, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve
System, or "FRB."

    Under the BHCA, a bank holding company may engage in banking, managing or
controlling banks, furnishing or performing services for banks it controls, and
conducting activities that the FRB has determined to be closely related to
banking. U.S. Bancorp must obtain the prior approval of the FRB before acquiring
more than five percent of the outstanding shares of another bank or bank holding
company, and must provide notice to, and in some situations obtain the prior
approval of, the FRB in connection with the acquisition of more than five
percent of the outstanding shares of a company engaged in a "bank-related"
business.

    Under the BHCA, as amended by the Riegle-Neal Act, U.S. Bancorp may acquire
banks throughout the United States, subject only to state or federal deposit
caps and state minimum-age requirements. Effective June 1, 1997, the Riegle-Neal
Act authorized interstate branching by acquisition and consolidation in those
states that had not opted out by that date.

    The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act of 1999 eliminated many of the restrictions
placed on the activities of certain qualified bank holding companies. Effective
March 13, 2000, U.S. Bancorp was certified by the FRB as a "financial holding
company" and may expand into a wide variety of financial services, including
securities activities, insurance and merchant banking, without the prior
approval of the FRB.

    National banks are subject to the supervision of, and are examined by, the
Office of the Comptroller of the Currency. All subsidiary banks of U.S. Bancorp
are members of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and are subject to
examination by the FDIC. In practice, the primary federal regulator makes
regular examinations of each subsidiary bank subject to its regulatory review or
participates in joint examinations with other federal regulators. Areas subject
to regulation by federal authorities include the allowance for credit losses,
investments, loans, mergers, issuance of securities, payment of dividends,
establishment of branches and other aspects of operations.

                       INFORMATION ABOUT NOVA CORPORATION

GENERAL

    NOVA Information Systems, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary and the
predecessor to NOVA Corporation, was incorporated in Georgia in February 1991.
NOVA was incorporated as a holding company in Georgia in December 1995 and has
been publicly traded on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol "NIS" since
May 1996. The company is headquartered in Atlanta, Georgia, with operations
centers in Atlanta, Georgia and Knoxville, Tennessee.

    NOVA provides transaction processing support for all major credit, charge,
and debit cards, including Visa, MasterCard, American Express, Discover, Diners
Club, JCB and private label cards. NOVA's proprietary information processing
network provides a direct, rapid and secure means of processing financial data.
In addition, NOVA has developed several value-added software applications for
both point-of-sale terminals and personal computers that can be delivered to
merchants and updated for enhancements via NOVA's proprietary telecommunications
network. With annual revenue in 2000 in excess of $1.57 billion, NOVA is the
third largest transaction processor in the United States (as measured by dollar
volume processed in 1999), serving more than 560,000 merchant locations. NOVA
focuses primarily on small- to medium-sized merchants that are not usually
served by the larger transaction processors, and NOVA has developed
technical/operating platforms, product/service offerings and multi-faceted
distribution channels specifically designed to facilitate the acquisition,
servicing and retention of small- to medium-sized business customers. NOVA's
customer base consists of more than 430,000 merchants and 560,000 locations
across all 50 states.

    Effective April 1, 2000, NOVA entered into a joint venture, EuroConex
Technologies Limited, with The Governor and Company of the Bank of Ireland.
EuroConex was formed for the purpose of providing transaction processing for
credit and debit cards and related e-commerce processing and services primarily
to retailers and financial institutions in a defined European market. The
EuroConex platform, which is based upon NOVA's network and technology platform,
is intended to be credit, debit and smart card compliant, multi-currency, and
capable of acquiring card transactions in the United Kingdom as well as Ireland.
NOVA anticipates that the EuroConex platform will be launched during the summer
of 2001 and that by the end of 2001, the platform will be Euro compliant and
able to support multi-currency conversion at the point-of-sale.

    You may obtain financial and other information relating to NOVA and its
directors and executive officers from its quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the

                           U.S. BANCORP CAPITAL STOCK

    As a result of the conversion of shares of NOVA common stock into shares of
U.S. Bancorp common stock in the merger, NOVA shareholders will become holders
of stock of U.S. Bancorp, and their rights will be governed by Delaware law and
by U.S. Bancorp's certificate of incorporation and bylaws. This description of
U.S. Bancorp's capital stock, including its common stock to be issued in the
merger, reflects the anticipated state of affairs at the effective time of the
merger. The following description summarizes the terms of U.S. Bancorp's capital
stock but does not purport to be complete,

and it is qualified in its entirety by reference to the applicable provisions of
federal law governing bank holding companies, Delaware law and U.S. Bancorp's
certificate of incorporation and bylaws.

COMMON STOCK OF U.S. BANCORP

    U.S. Bancorp is authorized to issue up to 4 billion shares of common stock,
par value $.01 per share. As of April 30, 2001, there were 1,908,494,035 shares
of U.S. Bancorp common stock issued (including 2,882,560 shares held in
treasury). The U.S. Bancorp common stock is listed on the New York Stock
Exchange under the symbol "USB."

    VOTING AND OTHER RIGHTS.  Each share of U.S. Bancorp common stock is
entitled to one vote per share, and, in general, a majority of votes cast with
respect to a matter will be sufficient to authorize action upon routine matters.
Directors are to be elected by a majority of the votes cast, and shareholders do
not have the right to cumulate their votes in the election of directors. For
that reason, holders of a majority of the shares of common stock of U.S. Bancorp
entitled to vote in any election of directors may elect all of the directors
standing for election. In general, however:

    - amendments to the certificate of incorporation will be approved if the
      votes cast within a voting group favoring the action exceed the votes cast
      within the voting group opposing the action; and

    - a merger or dissolution of U.S. Bancorp, or the sale of all or
      substantially all of its assets, must be approved by the affirmative vote
      of the holders of a majority of the voting power of the outstanding voting
      shares and the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the
      outstanding shares of each class entitled to vote on the matter as a
      class.

    NO PREEMPTIVE OR CONVERSION RIGHTS.  U.S. Bancorp common stock will not
entitle its holders to any preemptive rights, redemption privileges, sinking
fund privileges or conversion rights.

    ASSETS UPON DISSOLUTION.  In the event of liquidation, holders of U.S.
Bancorp common stock would be entitled to receive proportionately any assets
legally available for distribution to U.S. Bancorp shareholders with respect to
shares held by them, subject to any prior rights of any preferred stock of U.S.
Bancorp then outstanding.

    DISTRIBUTIONS.  Holders of U.S. Bancorp common stock will be entitled to
receive the dividends or distributions that U.S. Bancorp's board of directors
may declare out of funds legally available for these payments. The payment of
distributions by U.S. Bancorp is subject to the restrictions of Delaware law
applicable to the declaration of distributions by a corporation. Under Delaware
law, a corporation may not pay a dividend out of net profits if the capital
stock of the corporation is less than the stated amount of capital represented
by the issued and outstanding stock of all classes having a preference upon the
distribution of the corporation's assets. In addition, the payment of
distributions to shareholders is subject to any prior rights of outstanding
preferred stock.

    As a bank holding company, the ability of U.S. Bancorp to pay distributions
will be affected by the ability of its banking subsidiaries to pay dividends.
The ability of these banking subsidiaries, as well as of U.S. Bancorp, to pay
dividends in the future currently is, and could be further, influenced by bank
regulatory requirements and capital guidelines.

    RESTRICTIONS ON OWNERSHIP.  The Bank Holding Company Act generally would
prohibit any company that is not engaged in banking activities and activities
that are permissible for a bank holding company or a financial holding company
from acquiring control of U.S. Bancorp. Control is generally defined as
ownership of 25% or more of the voting stock or other exercise of a controlling
influence. In addition, any existing bank holding company would require the
prior approval of the Federal Reserve Board before acquiring 5% or more of the
voting stock of U.S. Bancorp. In addition, the Change in Bank Control Act of
1978, as amended, prohibits a person or group of persons from acquiring
"control" of a bank holding company unless the Federal Reserve Board has been
notified and has not objected to the transaction. Under a rebuttable presumption
established by the Federal Reserve Board, the acquisition of 10% or more of a
class of voting stock of a bank holding company with a

class of securities registered under Section 12 of the Exchange Act, such as
U.S. Bancorp, would, under the circumstances set forth in the presumption,
constitute acquisition of control of the bank holding company.

    U.S. BANCORP DIVIDEND REINVESTMENT AND COMMON STOCK PURCHASE PLAN.  Pursuant
to its U.S. Bancorp Dividend Reinvestment and Purchase Plan, or "DRIP," U.S.
Bancorp provides eligible shareholders with a method of investing cash dividends
and optional cash payments at 100% of the average price (as defined in the DRIP)
in additional shares of U.S. Bancorp common stock. Participants in the DRIP will
pay a brokerage commission or service charge, which currently is $.03 per share.
The DRIP includes some dollar limitations on participation. Shareholders who are
eligible to elect dividend reinvestment may choose to participate in the DRIP
with respect to some of their shares and not to participate with respect to
others. If shareholders choose not to participate in the DRIP with respect to
some or all of their shares, any dividends payable on those shares will be paid
in cash and will not be reinvested in U.S. Bancorp common stock.

PREFERRED STOCK OF U.S. BANCORP

    U.S. Bancorp is authorized to issue up to 50,000,000 shares of preferred
stock, par value $1.00 per share. The board of directors is authorized to issue
preferred stock in one or more series, to fix the number of shares in each
series, and to determine the designations and preferences, limitations and
relative rights of each series, including dividend rates, terms of redemption,
liquidation preferences, sinking fund requirements, conversion rights, voting
rights, and whether the preferred stock can be issued as a share dividend with
respect to another class or series of shares, all without any vote or other
action on the part of shareholders. This power is limited by applicable laws or
regulations and may be delegated to a committee of U.S. Bancorp's board of
directors.

    U.S. Bancorp currently has one series of preferred stock authorized and
outstanding. As of April 30, 2001, it had 55,796 shares of its Term
Participating Preferred Stock outstanding and an additional 790 shares
authorized and reserved for issuance.

SHAREHOLDER RIGHTS PLAN

    U.S. Bancorp has a shareholder rights plan that, under certain
circumstances, allows holders of U.S. Bancorp common stock to purchase shares in
either U.S. Bancorp or an acquiror at a discount to market value in response to
specified takeover events that are not approved by U.S. Bancorp's board of
directors. For a more detailed description of the shareholder rights plan, see
"COMPARISON OF SHAREHOLDER RIGHTS--Shareholder Rights Plan."

                        COMPARISON OF SHAREHOLDER RIGHTS

    The rights of NOVA shareholders are presently governed by the Georgia
Business Corporation Code, or "GBCC," NOVA's articles of incorporation and
NOVA's bylaws. Upon completion of the merger, the rights of NOVA shareholders
who become shareholders of U.S. Bancorp in the merger will be governed by the
Delaware General Corporation Law, or "DGCL," U.S. Bancorp's certificate of
incorporation and U.S. Bancorp's bylaws. The following is a summary of the
principal differences between the current rights of NOVA shareholders and those
of U.S. Bancorp shareholders following the merger. We do not intend the
following to be a complete discussion of the differences in the rights of NOVA
and U.S. Bancorp shareholders. This discussion is qualified in its entirety by
reference to the DGCL, the GBCC, U.S. Bancorp's certificate of incorporation and
bylaws, and NOVA's articles of incorporation and bylaws. U.S. Bancorp's
certificate of incorporation and bylaws and NOVA's articles of incorporation and
bylaws are presently available from U.S. Bancorp and NOVA, respectively, as well
as from the Securities and Exchange Commission, and will be sent to shareholders
of NOVA upon request.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS

    NOVA.  Under the GBCC, a corporation may provide in its articles of
incorporation for a board of directors divided into two or three classes, with
the size of the classes as even as possible. Shareholders of Georgia
corporations elect directors by a plurality of the votes cast unless the
articles of incorporation provide otherwise.

    NOVA's articles of incorporation provide that the board of directors will
consist of not less than seven persons, with all directors to be elected by the
holders of shares of the NOVA stock at the annual meeting of shareholders.
NOVA's articles of incorporation provide that holders of NOVA stock may cumulate
their votes. Accordingly, it is possible for the holders of less than a majority
of the shares of NOVA stock to elect one or more of the NOVA directors. NOVA's
articles of incorporation provide that no bylaw, resolution, written consent or
amendment to NOVA's articles of incorporation purporting to create a classified
or staggered board of directors or requiring prior notice or qualification of
members for directorship will be effective.

    NOVA's directors may be removed with or without cause at any annual or
special meeting of the shareholders. Under the GBCC, if cumulative voting is
authorized, a director may not be removed if the number of votes sufficient to
elect him under cumulative voting is voted against his removal; if cumulative
voting is not authorized, a director may be removed only by a majority of the
votes entitled to be cast. Accordingly, under NOVA's articles of incorporation,
a director may not be removed if the number of votes sufficient to elect him is
voted against his removal.

    U.S. BANCORP.  The DGCL permits a classified board of directors, divided
into as many as three classes. However, the DGCL does not require that the
classes be as even in size as possible.

    Under U.S. Bancorp's bylaws, U.S. Bancorp's board of directors has the
authority to determine the number of directors from time to time (with the
caveat that, under U.S. Bancorp's certificate of incorporation, the number of
directors may not be less than 12 nor more than 30). The directors of U.S.
Bancorp are divided into three classes (Class I, Class II and Class III), with
each class having the same number of directors as nearly as is possible. The
term of office of the Class I directors will expire at U.S. Bancorp's annual
meeting in 2002, the term of office of the Class II directors will expire at
U.S. Bancorp's annual meeting in 2003, and the term of office of the Class III
directors will expire at U.S. Bancorp's annual meeting in 2004. At each annual
election of directors, the directors chosen to succeed those whose terms have
then expired are identified as being of the same class as the directors they
succeed and are elected for a term expiring at the third succeeding annual
election of directors. Vacancies and newly created directorships resulting from
an increase in the number of directors may be filled by a majority of the
directors then in office, and the directors so chosen will hold office until the
next election of the class for which the directors were chosen and until their
successors are elected and qualified.

    The DGCL provides that directors may be removed from office, with or without
cause, by the holders of a majority of the voting power of all outstanding
voting stock, unless the corporation has a classified board and its certificate
of incorporation otherwise provides. If the corporation has cumulative voting,
in which event if less than the entire board is to be removed, no director may
be removed without cause if the votes cast against the director's removal would
be sufficient to elect that director if voted cumulatively either at an election
of the entire board of directors or for classes of the board. Under U.S.
Bancorp's certificate of incorporation, U.S. Bancorp's shareholders may remove a
director only for cause upon a majority vote of the shareholders.

ACTIONS BY SHAREHOLDERS WITHOUT A MEETING

    NOVA.  Under the GBCC, the shareholders of a corporation may take any action
which they could otherwise take at a meeting of the shareholders by written
consent without a meeting of all of

the shareholders entitled to vote on such action. The articles of incorporation
may also permit the shareholders to act by written consent signed by the
shareholders who would be entitled to vote at a meeting and who hold shares
having voting power to cast not less than the minimum number of votes that would
be necessary to authorize or take the action at a meeting. NOVA's articles of
incorporation provide that shareholders may take any action required or
permitted to be taken at a shareholders' meeting, other than the election of
directors, by a written consent executed by shareholders having sufficient
voting power to cast not less than the minimum number of votes required to
approve such action of a meeting of the shareholders where all shares entitled
to vote were present and voted.

    U.S. BANCORP.  Under the DGCL, unless a corporation's certificate of
incorporation provides otherwise, any action which may be taken at a meeting of
the shareholders of a corporation may be taken by written consent without a
meeting. Any such written consent must be executed by the holders of outstanding
stock having at least the minimum amount of votes necessary to take such action
at a meeting where all shareholders entitled to vote on such action are present.
U.S. Bancorp's certificate of incorporation provides that any action required or
permitted to be taken by the shareholders must be effected at a duly called
annual or special meeting of the shareholders and may not be effected by any
consent in writing by such shareholders.

SPECIAL MEETINGS

    NOVA.  NOVA's bylaws provide that a special meeting of the NOVA shareholders
may be called at any time by the President or any holder or holders of at least
50% of the outstanding NOVA common stock. Special meetings shall be held at such
a time and place and on such date as shall be specified in the notice of the
meeting.

    U.S. BANCORP.  The DGCL permits special meetings of shareholders to be
called by the board of directors and any other persons, including shareholders,
specified by the certificate of incorporation or bylaws. The DGCL does not
require that shareholders be given the right to call special meetings. U.S.
Bancorp's bylaws provide that special meetings of shareholders of the
corporation may be called only by U.S. Bancorp's board of directors or its chief
executive officer.

AMENDMENTS TO CERTIFICATE OR ARTICLES OF INCORPORATION

    NOVA.  Under the GBCC, the board of directors may amend the articles of
incorporation to take the following actions without obtaining shareholder
approval:

    - delete the names and addresses of the initial directors, initial
      registered agent or registered office, the initial principal office, and
      each incorporator;

    - change each issued or each issued and unissued authorized share of an
      outstanding class of stock into a greater number of whole shares if the
      corporation has only shares of that class outstanding;

    - change the corporate name;

    - extend the corporation's duration if it was incorporated at a time the law
      required limited duration;

    - change or eliminate the par value of each issued and unissued share of an
      outstanding class if the corporation has only shares of that class
      outstanding; or

    - make any other change permitted by the GBCC without shareholder action.

    The board of directors must approve other amendments and recommend them to
the shareholders. The shareholders must then approve the amendments by a
majority of the votes entitled to be cast on the amendment by each voting group
entitled to vote on the amendment unless the articles of

incorporation, the bylaws or another provision of the GBCC require a higher
vote. In general, the GBCC permits class or series voting on an amendment if the
amendment would change the number of authorized shares of a class, unless the
articles of incorporation provide otherwise, or adversely affect the rights,
powers or preferences of the shares of a class or series in a manner specified
by the statute.

    U.S. BANCORP.  U.S. Bancorp's certificate of incorporation provides that
those portions of the certificate of incorporation relating to the number and
classification of directors, filling of vacancies on the board of directors,
shareholder action by written consent, business transactions with related
persons and limitations on the liability of directors may not be amended without
the approval of an 80% shareholder majority. Under Section 242 of the DGCL, all
other amendments to U.S. Bancorp's certificate of incorporation require approval
by the holders of a majority of the voting power of U.S. Bancorp common stock
and resolution of U.S. Bancorp's board of directors in order to amend the
certificate of incorporation.

AMENDMENTS TO BYLAWS

    NOVA.  The GBCC permits a corporation's board of directors to amend, repeal
or adopt bylaws, unless:

    - the articles of incorporation reserve this power exclusively to the
      shareholders in whole or in part; or

    - the shareholders, in amending or repealing a particular bylaw, expressly
      reserve the power to amend or repeal that particular bylaw.

    The corporation's shareholders may also amend, repeal or adopt bylaws even
though the board may amend or repeal the same bylaws. The shareholders alone may
amend, repeal or adopt bylaws limiting the authority of the board of directors
or establishing staggered terms for directors. The shareholders alone may adopt
bylaws extending a greater quorum or voting requirement for shareholders. In
addition, the board of directors may not amend, repeal or adopt a bylaw fixing a
greater shareholder quorum or voting requirement unless the bylaw relates to the
GBCC's business combination or fair practice provisions. Unless provided
otherwise in a corporation's articles of incorporation or bylaws, adoption,
amendment or repeal of a bylaw fixing a greater quorum or voting requirement for
the board of directors requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the votes
entitled to be cast by the shareholders or of a majority of the directors. If
the shareholders adopt or amend such a bylaw, the bylaw or amendment may provide
that only a specified vote of either the shareholders or the board of directors
may amend that bylaw.

    U.S. BANCORP.  Pursuant to the DGCL, bylaws may generally be adopted,
amended or repealed either by approval of the majority of the outstanding shares
entitled to vote or, if provided in a corporation's certificate of
incorporation, by approval of the board of directors. U.S. Bancorp's certificate
of incorporation authorizes the board to amend U.S. Bancorp's bylaws, and also
authorizes the shareholders to adopt, amend, alter or repeal the bylaws adopted
by the directors.

GENERAL VOTING REQUIREMENTS

    NOVA.  The GBCC provides that unless the articles of incorporation, a bylaw
adopted by the shareholders or the GBCC requires a greater number of affirmative
votes, action by a voting group on a matter, other than the election of
directors, will be approved if the votes cast within the voting group favoring
the action exceed the votes cast opposing the action at a meeting where a quorum
is present.

    U.S. BANCORP.  The DGCL provides that unless the DGCL, the certificate of
incorporation or the bylaws provide otherwise, the affirmative vote of a
majority of the shares present in person or

represented by proxy at a meeting at which a quorum is present will constitute
approval by such voting group, except that directors will be elected by a
plurality of the votes of the shares entitled to vote.

VOTE REQUIRED FOR CERTAIN TRANSACTIONS

    NOVA.  In connection with the approval of proposed mergers and share
exchanges, and unless the GBCC requires a greater vote or a vote by voting
group, the articles of incorporation, bylaws or board resolutions, the GBCC
generally requires:

    - the affirmative vote of a majority of all votes entitled to be cast on the
      plan for such transaction, voting as a single group; and

    - the affirmative vote of a majority of the votes entitled to be cast by
      holders of shares of each voting group entitled to vote as a group under
      the corporation's articles of incorporation.

    Unless the articles of incorporation, bylaws or board resolutions require a
greater vote or a vote by voting groups, the GBCC provides that the shareholders
must approve the sale of all or substantially all of the assets of a corporation
by the affirmative vote of a majority of all the votes entitled to be cast on
the matter, regardless of voting groups. Shareholders of the surviving
corporation generally need not approve a merger if:

    - the articles of incorporation of the surviving corporation will not differ
      from the current articles;

    - each share of stock of the surviving or acquiring corporation outstanding
      immediately before the effective date of the merger or share exchange will
      be an identical outstanding or reacquired share immediately after the
      merger or share exchange; and

    - the number and kind of shares outstanding immediately after the merger or
      share exchange, plus the number and kind of shares issuable as a result of
      the merger or share exchange, do not exceed the total number and kind of
      shares of the surviving corporation authorized by its articles of
      incorporation immediately before the merger or share exchange.

    U.S. BANCORP.  Under the DGCL, a merger, consolidation or sale of all or
substantially all of a corporation's assets generally must be approved by the
shareholders of each constituent corporation by the affirmative vote of the
holders of a majority of the outstanding shares entitled to vote on the
transaction. The DGCL does not recognize share exchanges. No approval from the
shareholders of the surviving corporation is required if:

    - the corporation's certificate of incorporation will not be amended as a
      result of the merger;

    - each share of the corporation's stock outstanding immediately prior to the
      effective date of the merger will be an identical outstanding or treasury
      share of the surviving corporation after the effective date of the merger;
      and

    - any authorized unissued shares or treasury shares of the surviving
      corporation's common stock to be issued pursuant to the merger, including
      those initially issuable upon conversion of any other securities to be
      issued pursuant to the merger, do not exceed 20% of the shares of the
      surviving corporation's common stock outstanding immediately prior to the
      effective date of the merger.

    Except as disclosed below in "--Business Combinations with Interested
Shareholders," U.S. Bancorp's governing documents require approval of mergers,
consolidations and dispositions of all or substantially all of a corporation's
assets (other than so-called "parent-subsidiary" mergers) by a majority of the
voting power of the corporation. The DGCL does not require shareholder approval
for majority share acquisitions or for combinations involving the issuance of
less than 20% of the voting power of the corporation, except for "business
combinations" subject to Section 203 of the DGCL.

BUSINESS COMBINATIONS WITH INTERESTED SHAREHOLDERS

    NOVA.  The GBCC contains provisions regarding business combinations with
interested shareholders. These provisions are designed to encourage any person,
before acquiring 10% of the outstanding voting stock of a corporation, to seek
approval of its board of directors regarding the terms of any contemplated
business combination by prohibiting such business combination for a period of
five years, subject to certain exceptions in the statute.

    The provisions of the GBCC regarding business combinations do not apply to a
Georgia corporation unless it has affirmatively elected in its bylaws to be
governed by them. NOVA has adopted the business combination provisions of the
GBCC through election in the NOVA bylaws. These provisions, however, are not
applicable to the merger with U.S. Bancorp.

    U.S. BANCORP.  Unlike the Georgia provisions, Section 203 of the DGCL
prohibits a corporation from entering into certain business combination
transactions with any interested shareholder for a period of three years from
the time the shareholder becomes an interested shareholder, unless a certain
super-majority of the shareholders vote in favor of the transaction. The
prohibition will not apply if:

    - the board of directors has approved either the proposed business
      combination or the transaction resulting in interested shareholder status
      prior to the date that the shareholder became an interested shareholder;

    - upon completion of the transaction in which the shareholder became an
      interested shareholder, the interested shareholder owned at least 85% of
      the voting stock of the corporation outstanding at the time the
      transaction commenced; or

    - after the date that the shareholder became an interested shareholder, the
      interested shareholder obtains the approval of the board of directors and
      the approval at an annual or special meeting (and not by written consent)
      of two-thirds of the shares outstanding that are not held by the
      interested shareholder.

    A Delaware corporation may "opt out" of the requirements of Section 203 of
the DGCL if a majority of the outstanding shares entitled to vote adopt an
amendment to the corporation's certificate of incorporation or bylaws expressly
electing not to be governed by Section 203. U.S. Bancorp has not "opted out" of
Section 203.

FAIR PRICE PROVISIONS

    NOVA.  The GBCC also contains provisions designed to protect shareholders of
Georgia corporations against certain tactics used by acquiring corporations in
hostile takeover attempts. Specifically, the fair price provisions provide
protection from so-called two-tier transactions. In these transactions, the
acquiring party first usually tenders at a substantial premium for a major stock
interest in a target corporation. After having acquired such interest, the
acquiring party acquires total ownership of the corporation by effecting a
freeze-out merger which forces minority shareholders to receive cash or other
consideration for their common stock in the acquired corporation.

    Through a provision in the NOVA bylaws, NOVA has elected to be governed by
the fair price provisions of the GBCC.

    U.S. BANCORP.  Other than Section 203 of the DGCL described above, neither
the DGCL nor U.S. Bancorp's certificate of incorporation contains a provision
similar to the one described above.

SHAREHOLDER RIGHTS PLAN

    NOVA.  NOVA implemented a shareholder rights plan in July 1999 in order to
ensure that NOVA shareholders receive fair and equal treatment in the event of
any proposed takeover of NOVA, and to guard against partial tender offers,
squeeze-outs, open market accumulation and other tactics intended to gain
control of NOVA without paying all shareholders a fair price.

    Under the rights plan, the rights generally are exercisable only if a person
or group acquires 10% or more of NOVA's common stock (which percentage may be
increased under certain circumstances by the NOVA board of directors to 15%),
and each right initially will entitle shareholders, other than the acquiring
party, to purchase from NOVA 10 shares of NOVA common stock, subject to
adjustment. The number of shares that can be purchased upon exercise of the
rights will increase as the number of shares held by the acquiring party
increases. The rights will have an exercise price of 20% of the then-current
market price of the common stock on the stock acquisition date multiplied by the
number of shares of common stock to be received upon exercise. In addition, if
NOVA is acquired in a merger or other business combination after a person or
group acquired 10% or more of NOVA's outstanding common stock, each holder of
rights will be entitled to purchase, at the then-current price, a number of the
acquiring party's shares equal in value to those obtainable if the rights were
exercisable in NOVA's stock. The rights will expire in July of 2009.

    NOVA has amended its shareholder rights plan to exempt the merger agreement
from the provisions of the rights plan.

    U.S. BANCORP.  U.S. Bancorp has a shareholder rights plan that could
discourage unwanted or hostile takeover attempts that are not approved by the
U.S. Bancorp board. On February 27, 2001, U.S. Bancorp's board declared a
dividend of one preferred share purchase right for each outstanding share of
U.S. Bancorp common stock as of March 9, 2001. The rights currently trade with,
and are inseparable from, the common stock.

    Each right allows its holder to purchase from U.S. Bancorp one
one-thousandth of a share of U.S. Bancorp Series A Junior Participating
Preferred Stock for $100, once the rights become exercisable. This portion of a
preferred share will give the shareholder approximately the same dividend and
liquidation rights as would one share of common stock. Prior to exercise, a
right does not give its holder any dividend, voting or liquidation rights.

    The rights will not be exercisable until the earlier of:

    - 10 days after a public announcement that a person or group has obtained
      beneficial ownership of 10% or more of U.S. Bancorp's outstanding common
      stock; or

    - 10 business days after a person or group begins a tender or exchange offer
      that, if completed, would result in that person or group becoming the
      beneficial owner of 10% or more of U.S. Bancorp's outstanding common
      stock.

    The date when the rights become exercisable is referred to in the rights
plan as the "distribution date." After that date, the rights will separate from
the common stock and will be evidenced by book-entry credits or by rights
certificates that U.S. Bancorp will mail to all eligible holders of common
stock. A person or member of a group that has obtained beneficial ownership of
10% or more of U.S. Bancorp's outstanding common stock may not exercise any
rights even after the distribution date.

    A person or group that acquires beneficial ownership of 10% or more of U.S.
Bancorp's outstanding common stock is called an "acquiring person."

    - FLIP IN. If a person or group becomes an acquiring person, all holders of
      rights other than the acquiring person may purchase shares of U.S. Bancorp
      common stock at half their market value.

    - FLIP OVER. If, after a person or group becomes an acquiring person, U.S.
      Bancorp is acquired by another entity in a merger or similar transaction,
      all holders of rights other than the acquiring person may purchase shares
      of the acquiring company at half their market value.

    U.S. Bancorp's board may redeem the rights for $.01 per right at any time
before a person or group becomes an acquiring person. If the board redeems any
rights, it must redeem all of the rights. Once the rights are redeemed, the only
right of the holders of rights will be to receive the redemption price of $.01
per right.

    U.S. Bancorp's board may adjust the purchase price of the preferred shares,
the number of preferred shares issuable and the number of outstanding rights to
prevent dilution that may occur from a stock dividend, a stock split or a
reclassification of the preferred shares or common stock. No adjustments to the
exercise price of less than 1% will be made.

    The terms of the rights plan may be amended by U.S. Bancorp's board without
the consent of the holders of the rights. However, after a person or group
becomes an acquiring person, the board may not amend the plan in a way that
adversely affects the holders of the rights.

CONFLICTING INTEREST TRANSACTIONS

    NOVA.  The GBCC states that a director has a conflicting interest with
respect to a transaction that the corporation or any other entity in which the
corporation has a controlling interest effects or proposes if:

    - whether or not the transaction is brought before the board for action, to
      the knowledge of the director at the "time of commitment" the director or
      a related person is a party to the transaction or has a beneficial
      financial interest in or is so closely linked to the transaction and the
      transaction is of such financial significance to the director or a related
      person that it would reasonably be expected to exert an influence on the
      director's judgment if he or she were called upon to vote on the
      transaction; or

    - the transaction is brought, or would normally be brought, before the board
      of directors for action, and to the knowledge of the director at the time
      of the commitment any of the following persons is either a party to the
      transaction or has a beneficial financial interest so closely linked to
      the transaction and of such financial significance to such person that it
      would reasonably be expected to exert an influence on the director's
      judgment if he or she were called upon to vote on the transaction:

       - an entity other than the corporation of which the director is a
         director, general partner, agent or employee;

       - a person that controls one or more of the entities specified above or
         an entity that is controlled by, or is under common control with, one
         or more of the entities specified above; or

       - an individual who is a general partner, principal or employer of the
         director.

    Generally, an action by a shareholder or by or in the right of the
corporation may not enjoin, set aside or give rise to an award of damages or
other sanctions regarding a director's conflicting interest transaction on the
ground of an interest in the transaction of such director or any person with
whom such director has a personal, economic or other association, if:

    - the transaction receives the affirmative vote of a majority, but not less
      than two, of the disinterested directors or a committee of disinterested
      directors who voted on the transaction after required disclosure to them;

    - a majority of the votes entitled to be cast by disinterested shareholders
      were cast in favor of the transaction after

    - notice to the shareholders describing the conflicting interest
      transactions;

    - disclosure by such director, prior to the shareholders' vote to the
      secretary of the company of the number and identity of the persons holding
      or controlling the vote, of all shares that to the knowledge of the
      director are beneficially owned or the voting of which is controlled by
      that director or by a related person of the director, or both; and

    - required disclosure to the shareholders who voted on the transaction to
      the extent the required information was not known by them; or

    - the director can establish that the transaction, judged in the
      circumstances at the time of commitment, was fair to the corporation.

    The provisions of the GBCC that are applicable to directors also generally
apply to officers. These provisions provide that with respect to an officer who
is not also a director of the corporation, a conflicting interest transaction
may not be enjoined, set aside, or give rise to an award of damages or other
sanctions if:

    - the transaction was approved by the board of directors after required
      disclosure;

    - the transaction was approved by the shareholders after required
      disclosure; or

    - the officer can establish that the transaction, judged in the
      circumstances at the time of commitment, was fair to the corporation.

    U.S. BANCORP.  The DGCL states that contracts and transactions between a
Delaware corporation and one or more of its directors or officers, or
organizations in which they serve in such capacities or have a financial
interest will not be void or voidable solely because of such relationship.
Similarly, a transaction with a director or officer is not void or voidable
solely because such director or officer acts or participates in a board or
committee meeting authorizing the contract or transaction. Such transactions are
permissible if:

    - the material facts of the relationship or interest and as to the contract
      or transaction are disclosed or known to the board or committee and the
      board or committee in good faith authorizes the contract or transaction by
      the affirmative vote of a majority of the disinterested directors (even if
      the disinterested directors are less than a quorum); or

    - the contract or transaction is specifically approved in good faith by the
      shareholders entitled to vote thereon after the material facts as to the
      relationship or interest and as to the contract or transaction are
      disclosed to or are known to those shareholders; or

    - the contract or transaction is fair to the corporation as of the time that
      it is authorized by the board, a committee of the board or by the
      shareholders.

    U.S. Bancorp's certificate of incorporation provides that an 80% shareholder
majority must approve any "business transaction" with a "related person" unless:

    - the business transaction is approved by a majority of U.S. Bancorp's
      continuing directors; or

    - all the following criteria are satisfied:

       - certain fair price criteria are met;

       - after the related person acquires at least 10% of the voting power of
         U.S. Bancorp and before the business transaction is completed, the
         related person does not acquire any more

         voting securities of U.S. Bancorp except as part of the transaction in
         which the related person crossed the 10% threshold or as a result of a
         pro rata dividend or stock split; and

       - before the business transaction is completed, the related person does
         not (1) receive any loans, advances or other financial assistance from
         U.S. Bancorp, (2) cause any material change in U.S. Bancorp's business
         or equity capital structure, or (3) without the approval of U.S.
         Bancorp's continuing directors, cause U.S. Bancorp to fail to pay
         quarterly cash dividends or to reduce those dividends.

    The definition of "business combination" under U.S. Bancorp's certificate of
incorporation is generally similar to that contained in Section 203 of the DGCL.
A "related person" is defined as any person or group that beneficially owns 10%
or more of the voting power of U.S. Bancorp. A "continuing director" is one who
was on the U.S. Bancorp board of directors on April 24, 1986 or whose election
was approved by a majority of the then-continuing directors (unless the director
in question is a related person and the business transaction to be voted upon is
one in which the director has a personal interest other than as a shareholder).

APPRAISAL RIGHTS

    NOVA.  The GBCC grants shareholders the right to dissent and receive payment
of the fair value of their shares in the event of:

    - certain specified amendments to the articles of incorporation which
      materially and adversely affect the rights or interests of shareholders in
      their capacity as shareholders;

    - sales of all or substantially all of the corporation's assets, unless the
      sale is pursuant to a court order and the proceeds are distributed to the
      shareholders within one year after the sale; or

    - mergers or share exchanges on which the shareholders are entitled to vote
      or certain mergers of subsidiaries into parent corporations not requiring
      a shareholder vote.

    The right of appraisal is not available when the affected shares are listed
on a national securities exchange or held of record by more than 2,000
shareholders unless:

    - the articles of incorporation or a resolution of the board of directors
      approving the transaction provides otherwise; or

    - in a plan of merger or share exchange, the holders of such shares are
      required to accept anything other than shares of the surviving corporation
      or another publicly-held corporation listed on a national securities
      exchange or held of record by more than 2,000 shareholders, except for
      cash paid in lieu of fractional shares.

    Under the GBCC, the board of directors may nevertheless grant appraisal
rights to shareholders with respect to merger transactions. Shareholders who are
entitled to appraisal rights and who perfect those rights subsequently receive
cash from the corporation equal to the fair value of their shares as established
by agreement of the parties or judicial appraisal. Under the GBCC, however, fair
value does not include any appreciation or depreciation in share price due to
the anticipated corporate action, such as the merger.

    U.S. BANCORP.  Generally, the shareholders of a Delaware corporation who
object to mergers or consolidations of the corporation are entitled to appraisal
rights, requiring the corporation to pay the "fair value" of the dissenting
shares. There are statutory rights of appraisal, unless:

    - the stock with respect to which the dissent is made is:

       - listed on a national securities exchange;

       - designated as a national market system security on an interdealer
         quotation system;

       - held of record by more than 2,000 holders, or

       - is stock in the surviving corporation in a merger that was legally
         completed without shareholder approval under Delaware law; and

       - shareholders receive anything in the merger or consolidation other
         than:

           - shares of stock in the surviving corporation;

           - shares of stock of another corporation that is listed on a national
             securities exchange, designated as a national market system
             security or held by more than 2,000 holders, or

           - cash in lieu of fractional shares.

    The DGCL provides that a corporation may provide in its certificate of
incorporation for appraisal rights in connection with an amendment to the
corporation's certificate of incorporation, any merger or consolidation,
regardless of the shareholder's right to vote on such transaction, or the sale
of all or substantially all of the assets of the corporation. U.S. Bancorp has
not made provision for such rights in U.S. Bancorp's certificate of
incorporation.

PAR VALUE; DIVIDENDS AND REPURCHASES OF SHARES

    NOVA.  The GBCC dispenses with the concept of par value of shares, as well
as with statutory definitions of capital and surplus. The GBCC states, however,
that solely for the purpose of any statute or regulation imposing any tax or fee
based upon capitalization of the corporation, shares shall be deemed to have a
nominal or par value of $.01 per share. Where any federal or other statute or
regulation requires that shares have par value, a deemed par value shall be
determined by the board of directors solely for the purpose of satisfying the
requirements of the statute or regulation.

    The GBCC prohibits NOVA from making a distribution to its shareholders, if,
after giving such distribution effect:

    - NOVA would not be able to pay its debts as they become due in the usual
      course of business; or

    - NOVA's total assets would be less than the sum of its total liabilities
      plus the amount that would be needed, if NOVA were to be dissolved at the
      time of the distribution, to satisfy the preferential rights upon
      dissolution of shareholders whose preferential rights are superior to
      those receiving the distribution, unless the NOVA articles permit
      otherwise.

    The concept of distribution to shareholders includes any share repurchases
by NOVA.

    U.S. BANCORP.  The DGCL has retained the concepts of par value, capital and
surplus. The DGCL permits a corporation to declare and pay dividends out of
statutory surplus (defined as the excess of paid in par value of shares or
stated capital). If there is no surplus, dividends may be paid out of net
profits for the fiscal year in which the dividend is declared and/or for the
preceding fiscal year. No dividends may be paid unless the amount of capital
remaining of the corporation following the payment of the dividend is at least
the aggregate amount of the capital represented by the issued and outstanding
stock of all classes having a preference upon the distribution of assets. In
addition, the DGCL generally provides that a corporation may redeem or
repurchase its shares only if such redemption or repurchase would not impair the
capital of the corporation.

    U.S. Bancorp's certificate of incorporation provides that shares of U.S.
Bancorp common stock carry a par value per share of $.01.

                          DISSENTERS' APPRAISAL RIGHTS

    NOVA shareholders have the right to dissent from the merger and receive cash
payment for their shares of NOVA stock by following the procedures set forth in
Sections 14-2-1301 through 14-2-1332 of the GBCC. The following is only a
summary of the provisions of the GBCC and is qualified in its entirety by
reference to the full text of such provisions, a copy of which is attached to
this proxy statement/prospectus as Appendix C.

    The GBCC provides that any dissenting shareholder who wants to object to the
merger and receive payment in cash for the fair value of his or her NOVA stock
must deliver written notice of his or her intent to dissent and demand payment
of the fair value of his or her shares prior to the vote regarding the merger.
The notice must be delivered to NOVA Corporation, One Concourse Parkway,
Suite 300, Atlanta Georgia 30328, Attention: Secretary. If you vote in favor of
the merger proposal, you will not be entitled to payment as a dissenter, even if
a notice of dissent has been properly delivered.

    If the NOVA shareholders approve the merger, NOVA is required to send by
registered or certified mail a form of dissenters' notice to each of the
dissenting shareholders who filed a written notice of his or her intent to
dissent. This dissenters' notice must:

    - state where the dissenting shareholders' first payment demand must be sent
      and where and when certificates for certificated shares must be deposited;

    - inform the holders of uncertificated shares to what extent transfer of
      such shares will be restricted after payment demand is made;

    - state the date by which NOVA must receive the first payment demand, as
      fixed by NOVA between 30 and 60 days after the date the dissenter's notice
      is delivered; and

    - contain a copy of Article 13 of the GBCC relating to dissenters' rights.

    NOVA is required to send the dissenters' notice to each of the dissenting
shareholders no later than 10 days after the date of the merger. The dissenters'
notice will be sent to each dissenting shareholder at his or her address as it
appears in the stock transfer books of NOVA, unless the dissenting shareholder
provides NOVA with a different address.

    Each dissenting shareholder to whom NOVA sends a dissenter's notice must
submit a first payment demand for his or her shares to NOVA in accordance with
the terms of the dissenters' notice. The first payment demand must contain the
name and address of the dissenting shareholder, the number of shares as to which
the dissenting shareholder is demanding payment (which must be all of the shares
of capital stock of NOVA which he or she owns) and a demand for payment of the
fair value of his or her shares. Any dissenting shareholder who does not submit
a first payment demand as set forth in the dissenters' notice loses his or her
rights to dissent and will not be entitled to payment for his or her shares
pursuant to the dissenters' rights provisions of the GBCC.

    Within 10 days of the later of the closing date of the merger or NOVA's
receipt of the first payment demand, NOVA will offer to pay the dissenting
shareholders who have complied with the provisions of the GBCC the amount NOVA
estimates to be the fair value of the shares, plus any accrued interest. NOVA's
offer of payment shall be accompanied by:

    - NOVA's balance sheet as of the fiscal year ended not more than 16 months
      before the date of payment;

    - NOVA's income statement for that year;

    - a statement of changes in NOVA's shareholders' equity for that year;

    - NOVA's latest available interim financial statements, if any;

    - a statement of NOVA's estimate of the fair value of the shares;

    - an explanation of how the interest on the shares was calculated;

    - a statement of the dissenting shareholder's right to demand payment of a
      different amount if the dissenting shareholder is dissatisfied with the
      offer; and

    - a copy of Article 13 of the GBCC.

    A dissenting shareholder may accept NOVA's offer by providing written notice
to NOVA within 30 days after the date that NOVA made the offer. A dissenting
shareholder is deemed to have accepted such offer by failure to respond within
said 30 days. If the offer is accepted or deemed accepted, NOVA will pay for the
dissenting shareholder's NOVA stock within 60 days after the date NOVA made the
offer or the date of the merger, whichever date is later. If a dissenting
shareholder is dissatisfied with NOVA's offer, such dissenting shareholder may
make a second payment demand, notifying NOVA in writing of, and demand payment
of, his or her own estimate of the fair value of his or her shares and the
amount of interest due. A dissenting shareholder waives his or her right to
demand payment of a different amount than that offered by NOVA unless such
dissenting shareholder makes a second payment demand within 30 days after the
date NOVA makes its offer.

    If a dissenting shareholder's second payment demand remains unsettled within
60 days after NOVA receives the dissenting shareholder's second payment demand,
NOVA will submit the matter to the Superior Court of Fulton County, Georgia to
determine the fair value of the shares and accrued interest. NOVA shall make all
dissenting shareholders whose second payment demand remains unsettled parties to
the court proceeding. In the proceeding, the court will fix a value of the
shares and may appoint one or more appraisers to receive evidence and recommend
a decision on the question of fair value. If NOVA does not commence the
proceeding within 60 days after receiving the dissenting shareholder's second
payment demand, NOVA shall pay each dissenting shareholder whose second payment
demand remains unsettled the amount demanded by each such dissenting shareholder
in his or her second payment demand.

    The determination of a "fair value" necessarily involves matters of judgment
upon which reasonable persons may disagree. The GBCC provides that, for purposes
of dissenters' rights, the value of the NOVA stock is determined immediately
before the merger and that the fair value excludes any appreciation or
depreciation in anticipation of the merger.

    At the time of the meeting of the NOVA shareholders, NOVA will calculate the
total number of shares of NOVA stock which are the subject of appropriate
notices from dissenting shareholders, and NOVA and U.S. Bancorp will determine
the appropriate amount to be withheld from the cash available to other
shareholders who elect to receive their merger consideration in the form of
cash.

                                 LEGAL MATTERS

    The validity of the U.S. Bancorp common stock to be issued in connection
with the merger will be passed upon by Dorsey & Whitney LLP. Dorsey & Whitney
LLP and Long Aldridge & Norman LLP will deliver their opinions to U.S. Bancorp
and NOVA, respectively, as to the federal income tax consequences of the merger.
David M. Ivey, Esq., a partner in the firm of Long Aldridge & Norman LLP, is a
member of the board of directors of NOVA.

                                 OTHER MATTERS

bring any other matters before the special meeting requiring action of the
shareholders, nor does it have any information that other matters will be
brought before the special meeting. However, if any other matters requiring the
vote of the shareholders properly come before the special meeting, it is the

accordance with their best judgment in the interests of NOVA.

                           FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS

    This proxy statement/prospectus (including documents to which we refer you
in this proxy statement/ prospectus) contains forward-looking statements.
Statements that are not historical or current facts, including statements about
beliefs and expectations, are forward-looking statements. Forward-looking
statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual
results to differ materially from those anticipated. Some of these risks and
uncertainties include the following, in addition to those contained in U.S.
Bancorp's and NOVA's reports on file with the SEC:

    - U.S. Bancorp's investments in its consumer banking, payment systems and
      wealth management business and in its Internet development could require
      additional incremental spending, and might not produce expected deposit
      and loan growth and anticipated contributions to earnings;

    - general economic or industry conditions could be less favorable than
      expected, resulting in a deterioration in credit quality, a change in the
      allowance for credit losses, or a reduced demand for credit or fee-based
      products and services;

    - changes in the domestic interest rate environment could reduce net
      interest income and could increase credit losses;

    - the conditions of the securities markets could change, adversely affecting
      revenues from capital markets businesses, the value or credit quality of
      U.S. Bancorp's on-balance sheet and off-balance sheet assets, or the
      availability and terms of funding necessary to meet liquidity needs;

    - changes in the extensive laws, regulations and policies governing
      financial services companies could alter U.S. Bancorp's business
      environment or affect operations;

    - the potential need to adapt to industry changes in information technology
      systems, on which U.S. Bancorp is highly dependent, could present
      operational issues or require significant capital spending;

    - competitive pressures could intensify and affect U.S. Bancorp's
      profitability, including as a result of continued industry consolidation,
      the increased availability of financial services from non-banks,
      technological developments such as the internet, or bank regulatory
      reform; and

    - acquisitions may not produce revenue enhancements or cost savings at
      levels or within time-frames originally anticipated, or may result in
      unforeseen integration difficulties.

    Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date they are made, and U.S.
Bancorp undertakes no obligation to update them in light of new information or
future events. For further information relating to these and other risks, see

    Delaware of a certificate of merger in accordance with Section 252 of the
    DGCL, or such later date and time as may be set forth in such certificates.
    The Merger shall have the effects prescribed in the GBCC and the DGCL.

        (c)  CERTIFICATE OF INCORPORATION AND BY-LAWS.  The certificate of
    incorporation and by-laws of the Surviving Corporation immediately after the
    Effective Time shall be those of Acquirer as in effect immediately prior to
    the Effective Time.

        (d)  DIRECTORS AND OFFICERS OF THE SURVIVING CORPORATION.  The directors
    and officers of the Surviving Corporation immediately after the Effective
    Time shall be the directors and officers of Acquirer immediately prior to

waiver of the conditions as set forth in Article VII in accordance with this
Agreement, the parties shall cause the effective date of the Merger (the

the Effective Time, automatically by virtue of the Merger and without any action
on the part of any Person:

        (a)  ACQUIRER STOCK.  Each share of Acquirer Common Stock that is issued
    and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall remain
    outstanding and unaffected by the Merger, and, together with the shares
    converted into Acquirer Common Stock pursuant to Section 3.01(c),

                                      A-6

    shall constitute all of the then-issued and outstanding shares of capital
    stock of the Surviving Corporation.

    Treasury Stock immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be canceled and
    retired at the Effective Time and no consideration shall be issued in
    exchange therefor.

        (c)  CONVERSION OF COMPANY COMMON STOCK.  Subject to the provisions of
    this Section 3.01, each share of Company Common Stock (together with the
    associated Rights under the Rights Agreement), other than Treasury Stock,
    issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall by
    virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the holder
    thereof, be converted into the right to receive (i) $31.00 in cash (the
    "CASH CONSIDERATION") or (ii) 1.407 (the "EXCHANGE RATIO") validly issued,
    fully paid and nonassessable shares of Acquirer Common Stock (the "STOCK
    CONSIDERATION") or (iii) the right to receive a combination of cash and
    shares of Acquirer Common Stock determined in accordance with this Section
    (the "MIXED CONSIDERATION"). (The Cash Consideration, the Stock
    Consideration or the Mixed Consideration, together with any cash in lieu of
    fractional shares of Acquirer Common Stock to which a holder of Company
    Common Stock has the right to receive pursuant to Section 3.03, is referred
    to collectively herein as the "MERGER CONSIDERATION.")

        (d)  CASH ELECTION.  Subject to the immediately following sentence, each
    record holder of shares of Company Common Stock immediately prior to the
    Effective Time shall be entitled to elect to receive cash for all or any
    part of such holder's shares of Company Common Stock (a "CASH ELECTION").
    Notwithstanding the foregoing and subject to Section 3.01(l), the aggregate
    number of shares of Company Common Stock that may be converted into the
    right to receive cash in the Merger, together with any fractional shares of
    Acquirer Common Stock resulting from application of the Exchange Ratio
    ("FRACTIONAL SHARES") and any Dissenting Shares (as defined in
    Section 3.04(f)) (the "CASH ELECTION NUMBER"), shall be 40% of the total
    number of shares of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding as of the
    Effective Time. Cash Elections shall be made on a form designed for that
    purpose (a "FORM OF ELECTION"), which Form of Election shall be in such form
    as Acquirer and the Company shall mutually agree.

        (e)  CASH ELECTION SHARES.  If the aggregate number of shares of Company
    Common Stock covered by Cash Elections, together with any Fractional Shares
    and Dissenting Shares (the "CASH ELECTION SHARES"), exceeds the Cash
    Election Number, each Cash Election Share shall be converted into (i) the
    right to receive an amount in cash, without interest, equal to the product
    of (A) the Cash Consideration and (B) a fraction (the "CASH FRACTION"), the
    numerator of which shall be the Cash Election Number and the denominator of
    which shall be the total number of Cash Election Shares, and (ii) a number
    of shares of Acquirer Common Stock equal to the product of (A) the Exchange
    Ratio and (B) a fraction equal to one minus the Cash Fraction.

        (f)  STOCK ELECTION.  Subject to the immediately following sentence,
    each record holder of shares of Company Common Stock immediately prior to
    the Effective Time shall be entitled to elect to receive shares of Acquirer
    Common Stock for all or any part of such holder's shares of Company Common
    Stock (a "STOCK ELECTION"). Notwithstanding the foregoing and subject to
    Section 3.01(l), the aggregate number of shares of Company Common Stock that
    may be converted into the right to receive shares of Acquirer Common Stock
    in the Merger (the "STOCK ELECTION NUMBER") shall be 60% of the total number
    of shares of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding as of the Effective
    Time. Stock Elections shall be made on a Form of Election.

        (g)  STOCK ELECTION SHARES.  If the aggregate number of shares of
    Company Common Stock covered by Stock Elections (the "STOCK ELECTION
    SHARES") exceeds the Stock Election Number, each Stock Election Share shall
    be converted into (i) the right to receive a number of shares of Acquirer
    Common Stock, equal to the product of (A) the Exchange Ratio and (B) a
    fraction (the "STOCK FRACTION"), the numerator of which shall be the Stock
    Election Number and the

                                      A-7

    denominator of which shall be the total number of Stock Election Shares, and
    (ii) an amount in cash, without interest, equal to the product of (A) the
    Cash Consideration and (B) a fraction equal to one minus the Stock Fraction.

        (h)  MIXED ELECTION.  Subject to the immediately following sentence,
    each record holder of shares of Company Common Stock immediately prior to
    the Effective Time shall be entitled to elect to receive shares of Acquirer
    Common Stock for part of such holder's shares of Company Common Stock and
    cash for the remaining part of such holder's shares of Company Common Stock
    (the "MIXED ELECTION" and, collectively with Stock Election and Cash
    Election, the "ELECTION"). Notwithstanding the foregoing and subject to
    Section 3.01(l), the aggregate number of shares of Company Common Stock that
    may be converted into the right to receive the Cash Consideration shall be
    40%, and the aggregate number of shares of Company Common Stock that may be
    converted into the right to receive shares of Acquirer Common Stock in the
    Merger shall be 60%, in each case, of the total number of shares of Company
    Common Stock issued and outstanding as of the Effective Time. Mixed
    Elections shall be made on a Form of Election. With respect to each holder
    of Company Common Stock who makes a Mixed Election, the shares of Company
    Common Stock such holder elects to be converted into the right to receive
    Cash Consideration shall be treated as Cash Election Shares for purposes of
    the provisions contained in Sections 3.01(d) and (e), and the shares such
    holder elects to be converted into the right to receive shares of Acquirer
    Common Stock shall be treated as Stock Election Shares for purposes of the
    provisions contained in Sections 3.01(f) and (g).

        (i)  FORM OF ELECTION.  To be effective, a Form of Election must be
    properly completed, signed and submitted to such paying and exchange agent
    (which shall be a commercial bank or trust company) as Acquirer and the
    Company shall mutually agree (the "EXCHANGE AGENT"), and accompanied by the
    certificates representing the shares of Company Common Stock ("OLD
    CERTIFICATES") as to which the election is being made (or by an appropriate
    guarantee of delivery of such Old Certificate signed by a bank, broker,
    dealer, credit union, savings association or other entity that is a member
    in good standing of the Securities Transfer Agent's Medallion Program, the
    New York Stock Exchange Medallion Signature Guarantee Program or the Stock
    Exchange Medallion Program). A holder of record of shares of Company Common
    Stock who holds such shares as nominee, trustee or in another representative
    capacity (a "HOLDER REPRESENTATIVE") may submit multiple Forms of Election,
    provided that such Holder Representative certifies that each such Form of
    Election covers all the shares of Company Common Stock held by such Holder
    Representative for a particular beneficial owner. Acquirer shall have the
    discretion, which it may delegate in whole or in part to the Exchange Agent,
    to determine whether Forms of Election have been properly completed, signed
    and submitted or revoked and to disregard immaterial defects in Forms of
    Election. The decision of Acquirer (or the Exchange Agent) in such matters
    shall be conclusive and binding. Neither Acquirer nor the Exchange Agent
    shall be under any obligation to notify any person of any defect in a Form
    of Election submitted to the Exchange Agent. The Exchange Agent shall also
    make all computations contemplated by this Section 3.01, and all such
    computations shall be conclusive and binding on the holders of shares of
    Company Common Stock.

        (j)  DEEMED NON-ELECTION.  For the purposes hereof, a holder of shares
    of Company Common Stock who does not submit a Form of Election that is
    received by the Exchange Agent prior to the Election Deadline (the "NO
    ELECTION SHARES") shall be deemed not to have made a Cash Election, Stock
    Election or Mixed Election. If Acquirer or the Exchange Agent shall
    determine that any purported Election was not properly made, the shares
    subject to such improperly made Election shall be treated as No Election
    Shares. No Election Shares shall be treated as Cash Election Shares or Stock
    Election Shares, as Acquirer shall determine so as to minimize the amount of
    cash to be received by holders making Stock Elections and the amount of
    Acquirer Common Stock to be received by holders making Cash Elections.

                                      A-8

        (k)  ELECTION DEADLINE.  Acquirer and the Company shall each use its
    reasonable best efforts to cause copies of the Form of Election to be mailed
    on the Mailing Date (as defined below) to each holder of record of shares of
    Company Common Stock (other than holders of Treasury Stock) as of a record
    date which shall be the same date as the record date for eligibility to vote
    on the Merger. The "MAILING DATE" shall be the date on which proxy materials
    relating to the Merger are mailed to holders of shares of Company Common
    Stock. In order to be effective, a Form of Election must be received by the
    Exchange Agent by 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on the 25th calendar day
    following the Mailing Date, or such other time and date as Acquirer and the
    Company may mutually agree (the "ELECTION DEADLINE"). All elections may be
    revoked until the Election Deadline in writing by the record holders
    submitting Forms of Election.

        (l)  TAX ADJUSTMENT.  Notwithstanding anything in this Article III to
    the contrary, the sum of (i) the aggregate amount of cash that will be
    issued in the Merger as Cash Consideration, (ii) any cash amounts to be paid
    pursuant to Section 3.03 for Fractional Shares, (iii) any cash amounts to be
    paid for Dissenting Shares pursuant to Section 3.04(f) (assuming that the
    cash to be paid for each Dissenting Share is equal to the Closing Acquirer
    Price, as defined below, for purposes of such calculation), (iv) any other
    amounts paid by Acquirer or the Company to or on behalf of any stockholder
    of the Company in connection with the sale, redemption or other disposition
    of any shares of capital stock of the Company in connection with the Merger
    for purposes of Treasury Regulation Sections 1.368-1(e) and 1.368-1T(e), and
    (v) the amount of any extraordinary dividend distributed by the Company
    prior to and in connection with the Merger for purposes of Treasury
    Regulation Section 1.368-1T(e) (the sum of such amounts, the "AGGREGATE CASH
    AMOUNT") shall not exceed 50% of the Aggregate Consideration (as defined
    below). The "AGGREGATE CONSIDERATION" shall be equal to the number of shares
    of Acquirer Common Stock to be issued in the Merger times the Closing
    Acquirer Price plus the Aggregate Cash Amount. The "CLOSING ACQUIRER PRICE"
    means the closing price of the Acquirer Common Stock on the New York Stock
    Exchange (composite transactions list), as reported by THE WALL STREET
    JOURNAL, on the last trading day prior to the Effective Date. If the
    Aggregate Cash Amount as so calculated would exceed 50% of the Aggregate
    Consideration, Acquirer may, but shall not be required to, either increase
    the number of shares of Acquirer Common Stock to be issued in the Merger on
    a proportionate basis or may increase the Stock Election Number (and
    decrease the Cash Election Number) such that the Aggregate Cash Amount would
    not exceed 50% of the Aggregate Consideration (the "TAX ADJUSTMENT"). In the
    event that Acquirer does not make the Tax Adjustment and the tax opinions
    provided for in either Section 7.02(c) or 7.03(c) cannot be delivered as
    result of Acquirer's failure to make the Tax Adjustment, then the delivery
    of such opinions shall no longer be conditions to the Closing.

    3.02  RIGHTS AS SHAREHOLDERS; STOCK TRANSFERS.  At the Effective Time,
holders of Company Common Stock shall cease to be, and shall have no rights as,
shareholders of the Company, other than to receive any dividend or other
distribution with respect to Company Common Stock with a record date occurring
prior to the Effective Date and the Merger Consideration provided in this
Article III, including any dissenter's rights provided in Section 3.04(f). After
the Effective Time, there shall be no transfers on the stock transfer books of
the Company or the Surviving Corporation of shares of Company Common Stock.

    3.03  FRACTIONAL SHARES.  Notwithstanding any other provision hereof, no
certificates for fractional shares of Acquirer Common Stock, or other evidence
of ownership thereof, will be issued in the Merger; instead, Acquirer shall pay
to each holder of Company Common Stock who would otherwise be entitled to a
fractional share of Acquirer Common Stock (after taking into account all of the
shares of Company Common Stock represented by all of the Old Certificates
delivered by such holder) an amount in cash (without interest) determined by
multiplying such fraction by the average of the closing sale prices of Acquirer
Common Stock, as reported by the NYSE Composite Transactions Reporting

                                      A-9

System (as reported in THE WALL STREET JOURNAL or, if not reported therein, in
another authoritative source), for the five NYSE trading days immediately
preceding the Effective Date.

    3.04  EXCHANGE PROCEDURES.

        (a)  DEPOSIT OF EXCHANGE FUND.  At or prior to the Effective Time,
    Acquirer shall deposit, or shall cause to be deposited, with the Exchange
    Agent, for the benefit of the holders of shares of Company Common Stock, for
    exchange in accordance with this Article III, an amount of cash and
    certificates or book-entry securities representing shares of Acquirer Common
    Stock ("NEW CERTIFICATES") required to effect the conversion of Company
    Common Stock into Acquirer Common Stock, and cash in accordance with
    Sections 3.01(c), 3.03 and 3.04(f) (such cash and New Certificates, together
    with any dividends or distributions with a record date occurring after the
    Effective Date with respect thereto (without any interest on any such cash,
    dividends or distributions) being hereinafter referred to as the "EXCHANGE
    FUND").

        (b)  EXCHANGE OF CERTIFICATES.  As promptly as practicable after the
    Effective Date, Acquirer shall send or cause to be sent to each former
    holder of record of shares of Company Common Stock (other than Cash Election
    Shares or Treasury Stock) immediately prior to the Effective Time
    transmittal materials for use in exchanging such shareholder's Old
    Certificates for the Merger Consideration set forth in this Article III.
    Acquirer shall cause the New Certificates representing Acquirer Common Stock
    into which shares of a holder's Company Common Stock are converted on the
    Effective Date and/or a check in respect of the Cash Consideration into
    which shares of a holder's Company Common Stock are converted at the
    Effective Time and any fractional share interests or dividends or
    distributions which such Person shall be entitled to receive to be delivered
    to such holder upon delivery to the Exchange Agent of Old Certificates
    representing such shares of Company Common Stock (or indemnity reasonably
    satisfactory to Acquirer and the Exchange Agent, if any of such certificates
    are lost, stolen or destroyed) owned of record immediately prior to the
    Effective Time by such holder. No interest will be paid on any such cash to
    be paid in lieu of fractional share interests or dividends or distributions
    which any such Person shall be entitled to receive pursuant to this
    Article III upon such delivery.

        (c)  UNCLAIMED CERTIFICATES.  If Old Certificates are not surrendered or
    consideration therefore is not claimed prior to the date on which such
    consideration would otherwise escheat to or become the property of any
    governmental unit or agency, the unclaimed consideration and any unpaid
    dividends or distributions thereon shall, to the extent permitted by
    abandoned property and any other applicable law, become the property of
    Acquirer (and to the extent not in its possession shall be paid over to
    Acquirer), free and clear of all claims or interest of any Person previously
    entitled to such claims. Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither the Exchange
    Agent nor any party hereto shall be liable to any former holder of Company
    Common Stock for any amount properly delivered to a public official pursuant
    to applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar laws.

        (d)  DISTRIBUTIONS IN RESPECT OF UNCLAIMED CERTIFICATES.  No dividends
    or other distributions with respect to Acquirer Common Stock with a record
    date occurring after the Effective Time shall be paid to the holder of any
    unsurrendered Old Certificate representing shares of Company Common Stock
    converted in the Merger into the right to receive shares of such Acquirer
    Common Stock until the holder thereof shall be entitled to receive New
    Certificates in exchange therefor after having complied with the procedures
    set forth in this Section 3.04, and no such shares of Acquirer Common Stock
    shall be eligible to vote until the holder of Old Certificates is entitled
    to receive New Certificates after having complied with the procedures set
    forth in this Section 3.04. After becoming so entitled and after having
    complied with this Section 3.04, the record holder thereof also shall be
    entitled to receive any such dividends or other distributions, without any
    interest thereon, which theretofore had otherwise become payable with
    respect to shares of

                                      A-10

    Acquirer Common Stock such holder had the right to receive upon surrender of
    the Old Certificate.

        (e)  DISPOSITION OF UNCLAIMED EXCHANGE FUND.  Any portion of the
    Exchange Fund that remains unclaimed by the shareholders of the Company for
    twelve months after the Effective Time shall be returned by the Exchange
    Agent to Acquirer if Acquirer so requests. In the event of the return of
    such Exchange Fund to Acquirer, subject to Section 3.04(c), any shareholders
    of the Company who have not heretofore complied with this Article III shall
    thereafter look only to Acquirer for payment of the shares of Acquirer
    Common Stock, cash in lieu of any fractional shares of Acquirer Common
    Stock, and unpaid dividends and distributions on Acquirer Common Stock
    deliverable in respect of each share of Company Common Stock such
    shareholder holds immediately prior to the Effective Time, as determined
    pursuant to this Agreement, in each case, without any interest thereon.

        (f)  DISSENTING SHARES.  Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to
    the contrary, shares of Company Common Stock that are outstanding
    immediately prior to the Effective Time and that are held by a "dissenter"
    as defined in Section 14-2-1301 of the GBCC (such shares are referred to
    herein as "DISSENTING SHARES") shall not be converted into the right to
    receive the Merger Consideration but, instead, the holder thereof shall be
    entitled to receive payment of the fair value of such Dissenting Shares as
    determined in accordance with the provisions of Sections 14-2-1301
    through14-2-1332 ("SECTIONS 1301 ET SEQ.") of the GBCC; PROVIDED, HOWEVER,
    that if any holder of Dissenting Shares shall subsequently withdraw his or
    her demand for the payment of the fair value of such shares or fails to
    establish or perfect or otherwise loses his or her entitlement to payment of
    the fair value of such shares as provided in Sections 1301 et seq., such
    holder shall not be entitled to receive payment of the fair value of such
    shares of Company Common Stock as contemplated by Sections 1301 et seq. If
    any such holder shall have so failed to perfect or effectively withdrawn or
    lost such right, each of such holder's shares of Company Common Stock shall
    thereupon be deemed to be No Election Shares for all purposes under this
    Article III.

    3.05  ANTI-DILUTION PROVISIONS.  In the event Acquirer changes (or
establishes a record date for changing) the number of shares of Acquirer Common
Stock issued and outstanding prior to the Effective Date as a result of any
stock split, recapitalization, reclassification, combination, exchange of
shares, readjustment or similar transaction with respect to the outstanding
Acquirer Common Stock, or Acquirer declares a stock dividend or extraordinary
cash dividend, and the record date therefor shall be prior to the Effective
Date, the Exchange Ratio and the Stock Consideration shall be equitably and
proportionately adjusted as appropriate. If, between the date hereof and the
Effective Time, Acquirer shall merge, be acquired or consolidate with, by or
into any other corporation (a "BUSINESS COMBINATION") and the terms thereof
shall provide that Acquirer Common Stock shall be converted into or exchanged
for the shares of any other corporation or entity, then provision shall be made
as part of the terms of such Business Combination so that shareholders of the
Company who would be entitled to receive shares of Acquirer Common Stock
pursuant to this Agreement shall be entitled to receive, in lieu of each share
of Acquirer Common Stock issuable to such shareholders as provided herein, the
same kind and amount of securities or assets as shall be distributable upon such
Business Combination with respect to one share of Acquirer Common Stock
(provided that nothing herein shall be construed so as to release the acquiring
entity in any such Business Combination from its obligations under this
Agreement as the successor to Acquirer).

    3.06  OPTIONS AND WARRANTS.

        (a) At the Effective Time, except as otherwise agreed between Acquirer
    and the holders thereof, all outstanding options to purchase shares of
    Company Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
    under any of the Compensation and Benefit Plans (all such options of an
    option holder having the same exercise price, a "COMPANY STOCK OPTION")
    shall

                                      A-11

    be converted into an option to acquire, on the same terms and conditions as
    were applicable under such Company Stock Option, the number of shares of
    Acquirer Common Stock equal to (i) the number of shares of Company Common
    Stock subject to the Company Stock Option, multiplied by (ii) the Exchange
    Ratio (such product rounded up (or down as provided below with respect to
    "incentive stock options") to the nearest whole number) (all such new
    options of an option holder, a "REPLACEMENT OPTION"), at an exercise price
    per share (rounded up or down to the nearest whole cent) equal to (y) the
    exercise price per share for the shares of Company Common Stock which were
    purchasable pursuant to such Company Stock Option divided by (z) the
    Exchange Ratio. Notwithstanding the foregoing, each Company Stock Option
    that is intended to be an "incentive stock option" (as defined in
    Section 422 of the Code) shall be adjusted in accordance with the
    requirements of Section 424 of the Code. At or prior to the Effective Time,
    the Company shall take all reasonable action, if any, necessary with respect
    to the Compensation and Benefit Plans to permit the replacement of the
    outstanding Company Stock Options by Acquirer pursuant to this Section. At
    the Effective Time, Acquirer shall assume the Compensation and Benefit
    Plans; PROVIDED, that such assumption shall be only in respect of the
    Replacement Options resulting from the conversion of Company Stock Options
    issued under such plans and that Acquirer shall have no obligation with
    respect to any awards under the Compensation and Benefit Plans other than
    the Replacement Options and shall have no obligation to make any additional
    grants or awards under such assumed Compensation and Benefit Plans. The
    Company shall not, and shall cause any Compensation and Benefit Plan
    administrator not to, take any action prior to the Effective Time that will
    extend the exercise period of any Company Stock Option or cause the vesting
    period of any Company Stock Option to accelerate under any circumstances,
    regardless of whether such circumstances are to occur before or after the
    Effective Time, or otherwise amend the terms of outstanding Company Stock
    Options.

        (b) All outstanding rights of the Company that it may hold immediately
    prior to the Effective Time to repurchase vested or unvested shares of
    Company Common Stock (the "REPURCHASE OPTIONS") shall continue in effect
    following the Merger and shall continue to be exercisable by Acquirer upon
    the same terms and conditions in effect immediately prior to the Effective
    Time, except that the shares purchasable pursuant to the Repurchase Options
    and the purchase price per share shall be adjusted to reflect the conversion
    to Acquirer Common Stock and the Exchange Ratio.

        (c) At the Effective Time, except as otherwise agreed between Acquirer
    and the holders thereof, all outstanding warrants to purchase shares of
    Company Common Stock (all such warrants of a warrant holder having the same
    exercise price, a "COMPANY WARRANT") shall be converted into a warrant to
    acquire, on the same terms and conditions as were applicable under such
    Company Warrant, the number of shares of Acquirer Common Stock equal to
    (i) the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to the Company
    Warrant, multiplied by (ii) the Exchange Ratio (such product rounded up to
    the nearest whole number) (all such new warrants of a warrant holder, a
    "REPLACEMENT WARRANT"), at an exercise price per share (rounded up or down
    to the nearest whole cent) equal to (y) the exercise price per share for the
    shares of Company Common Stock which were purchasable pursuant to such
    Company Warrant divided by (z) the Exchange Ratio. At or prior to the
    Effective Time, the Company shall take all reasonable action, if any,
    necessary with respect to the applicable warrants or warrant agreements to
    permit the replacement of the outstanding Company Warrants by Acquirer
    pursuant to this Section.

        (d) Prior to the Effective Time, Acquirer shall reserve for issuance the
    number of shares of Acquirer Common Stock necessary to satisfy Acquirer's
    obligations under this Section 3.06.

                                      A-12

                                   ARTICLE IV

Time, except as expressly contemplated by this Agreement, without the prior
written consent of Acquirer (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld),

contractual ability to do so) each of its Subsidiaries not to:

    ordinary course of business.

                                      A-13

        (h)  ACQUISITIONS.  Acquire all or any portion of the assets, business
    or properties of any other entity except in the ordinary course of business

    4.02  FORBEARANCES OF ACQUIRER.  From the date hereof until the Effective
Time, except as expressly contemplated by this Agreement, without the prior
written consent of the Company, Acquirer will not, and Acquirer will cause each
of its Subsidiaries not to:

        (a)  DELAY.  Take any action Acquirer knows would materially and

       to the Effective Time, (B) any of the conditions to the Merger set forth

                                   ARTICLE V
                         REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES

    5.01  DISCLOSURE SCHEDULE.  On or prior to the date hereof, the Company has
delivered to Acquirer a schedule (the "DISCLOSURE SCHEDULE") setting forth,
among other things, items the disclosure of which is necessary either in
response to an express disclosure requirement contained in a provision hereof or
as an exception to one or more representations or warranties contained in
Section 5.02; PROVIDED, that (a) no such item is required to be set forth in a
Disclosure Schedule as an exception to a representation or warranty if its
absence would not be reasonably likely to result in the related representation
or warranty being deemed untrue or incorrect under the standard set forth in
Sections 7.02(a) and 7.03(a), and (b) the mere inclusion of an item in a
Disclosure Schedule as an exception to a representation or warranty shall not be
deemed an admission by a party that such item has had or will have a Material
Adverse Effect.

    5.02  REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY.  Subject to
Section 5.01 and except as Previously Disclosed, the Company hereby represents
and warrants to Acquirer:

        (a)  ORGANIZATION, STANDING AND AUTHORITY.  The Company is a corporation
    duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the
    State of Georgia. The Company is duly licensed and qualified to do business
    and is in good standing in the states of the United States and any foreign
    jurisdictions where its ownership or leasing of property or assets or the
    conduct of its business requires it to be so licensed and qualified, except
    where the failure to be so licensed and qualified would not, individually or
    in the aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company. The Company
    has in effect all federal, state, local, and foreign governmental
    authorizations necessary for it to own or lease its properties and assets
    and to carry on its business as it is now conducted, except where the
    failure to have such authorizations in effect would not, individually or in
    the aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company. The copies of
    the Company Articles and Company By-Laws which have been provided to
    Acquirer prior to the date of this Agreement are correct and complete and
    reflect all amendments made thereto through the date hereof. Complete and
    accurate copies of the minute books of the Company have been made available
    to Acquirer and fairly and accurately reflect, in all material respects, all
    material corporate action taken by the Company Board and the shareholders of
    the Company since December 31, 1998.

    this Agreement, except as referred to above or as Previously Disclosed, the
    Company does not have any Rights issued or outstanding with respect to any
    shares of Company Common Stock or any other equity securities of the
    Company.

        (c)  SUBSIDIARIES; OWNERSHIP OF OTHER SECURITIES.

           (i) The Company has Previously Disclosed a list of all of its
       Subsidiaries together with the jurisdiction of incorporation of each such
       Subsidiary. Except as Previously Disclosed, (A) the Company owns,
       directly or indirectly, all of the issued and outstanding capital stock
       of each of its Subsidiaries, (B) no equity securities of any of its
       Subsidiaries are or may become required to be issued (other than to it or
       its Subsidiaries) by reason of any Rights, (C) there are no contracts,
       commitments, understandings or arrangements by which any of such
       Subsidiaries is or may be bound to sell or otherwise transfer any shares
       of the capital stock of any such Subsidiaries (other than to it or its
       Subsidiaries), (D) there are no contracts, commitments, understandings,
       or arrangements relating to its rights to vote or to dispose of such
       shares (other than to it or its Subsidiaries), and (E) all of the shares
       of capital stock of each such Subsidiary held by it or its Subsidiaries
       are fully paid and nonassessable and are owned by it or its Subsidiaries
       free and clear of any Liens.

           (ii) None of the Company or its Subsidiaries owns beneficially,
       directly or indirectly, any equity securities or similar interests of any
       Person, or any interest in a partnership or joint venture of any kind,
       other than its Subsidiaries.

          (iii) Except as Previously Disclosed, each of the Company's
       Subsidiaries has been duly organized or formed and is validly existing in
       good standing under the laws of the jurisdiction of its incorporation or
       formation, as the case may be, and is duly qualified to do business and
       in good standing in the jurisdictions where its ownership or leasing of
       property or the conduct of its business requires it to be so qualified,
       except where the failure to be so qualified would not, individually or in
       the aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company. Each of
       such Subsidiaries has in effect all federal, state, local, and foreign
       governmental authorizations necessary for it to own or lease its
       properties and assets and to carry on its business as it is now
       conducted, except where the failure to have such authorizations in effect
       would not, individually or in the aggregate, have a Material Adverse
       Effect on the Company.

        (d)  CORPORATE POWER.  Each of the Company and its Subsidiaries has the
    corporate or other power and authority to carry on its business as it is now
    being conducted and to own all of its

                                      A-16

    properties and assets; and the Company has the corporate power and authority
    to execute, deliver and perform its obligations under this Agreement and to
    consummate the transactions contemplated hereby.

        (e)  CORPORATE AUTHORITY.  This Agreement and the transactions
    contemplated hereby have been duly approved by the Company Board on or prior
    to the date hereof and no other corporate proceedings on the part of the
    Company are necessary to authorize this Agreement and the transactions
    contemplated hereby (other than approval of the Merger by the Company's
    shareholders required by applicable law). This Agreement is a valid and
    legally binding obligation of the Company, enforceable in accordance with
    its terms (except as enforceability may be limited by applicable bankruptcy,
    insolvency, reorganization, moratorium, fraudulent transfer and similar laws
    of general applicability relating to or affecting creditors' rights
    generally or by general equity principles). The Company Board has received
    the opinion of SSB to the effect that as of the date hereof the
    consideration to be received by the holders of Company Common Stock in the
    Merger is fair to the holders of Company Common Stock from a financial point
    of view.

        (f)  REGULATORY APPROVALS; NO DEFAULTS.

           (i) No consents or approvals of, or filings or registrations with,
       any Governmental Authority or any third party are required to be made or
       obtained by the Company in connection with the execution, delivery or
       performance by the Company of this Agreement or to consummate the
       transactions contemplated hereby, where failure to obtain such consents
       or approvals, or to make such filings and registrations would,
       individually or in the aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect on the
       Company or the Surviving Corporation except for: (A) the filings and
       applicable requirements under the HSR Act with respect to both this
       Agreement and the LLC Buyout Agreement; (B) filings with the SEC and
       state securities authorities; (C) the approval of the Merger by the
       shareholders of the Company; and (D) the filing of the certificate of
       merger as contemplated in Section 2.01(b). As of the date hereof, the
       Company is not aware of any reason why the approvals set forth in
       Section 7.01(b) will not be received.

           (ii) Except as Previously Disclosed, and subject to receipt of the
       regulatory and shareholder approvals referred to in the preceding
       paragraph, and the expiration of related waiting periods, and required
       filings under federal and state securities laws, the execution, delivery
       and performance of this Agreement and the consummation of the
       transactions contemplated hereby do not and will not:

               (A) constitute a breach or violation of, a default under, result
           in the loss of any benefit under or give rise to any Lien, penalty,
           acceleration of performance or remedies or any right of termination
           or suspension under, any law, rule or regulation or any judgment,
           decree, order, governmental permit or license, or agreement,
           arrangement, understanding, indenture, deed of trust, note, bond,
           mortgage, lease or other instrument of the Company or any of its
           Subsidiaries or to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or
           any of their respective properties is subject or bound, except in
           such instances that would not, individually or in the aggregate, have
           a Material Adverse Effect on the Company; or

               (B) constitute a breach or violation of, or a default under, the
           Company Articles or Company By-Laws or the certificate of
           incorporation or by-laws (or similar governing documents) of any of
           the Company's Subsidiaries.

        (g)  FINANCIAL REPORTS AND SEC DOCUMENTS.  The Annual Reports on
    Form 10-K for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2000, 1999 and 1998 and
    all other reports, registration statements, definitive proxy statements or
    information statements filed or to be filed subsequent to

                                      A-17

    December 31, 1998 under the Securities Act or under Sections 13(a), 13(c),
    14 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act, in the form filed or to be filed with the
    SEC (collectively, the "SEC DOCUMENTS"), of the Company or any of its
    Subsidiaries, as of the date filed (i) complied or will comply in all
    material respects as to form with the applicable requirements under the
    Securities Act or the Exchange Act, as the case may be, and (ii) did not and
    will not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a
    material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the
    statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were
    made, not misleading, except that information as of a later date (but before
    the date hereof) shall be deemed to supersede information as of an earlier
    date; and each of the balance sheets contained in or incorporated by
    reference into any such SEC Document of the Company or any of its
    Subsidiaries, including the related notes and schedules thereto, fairly
    presents and will fairly present, in all material respects, the financial
    position of the entity or entities to which it relates as of its date, and
    each of the statements of income and changes in shareholders' equity and
    cash flows or equivalent statements in such SEC Documents of the Company or
    any of its Subsidiaries (including any related notes and schedules thereto)
    fairly presents and will fairly present, in all material respects, the
    results of operations, changes in shareholders' equity and changes in cash
    flows, as the case may be, of the entity or entities to which it relates for
    the periods to which they relate, in each case in accordance with GAAP
    consistently applied during the periods involved, except in each case as may
    be noted therein, subject to normal year-end audit adjustments in the case
    of unaudited statements.

        (h)  NO MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT.  Except as Previously Disclosed, since
    December 31, 2000, no event has occurred or circumstance arisen that,
    individually or in the aggregate, has had or will have a Material Adverse
    Effect with respect to the Company.

        (i)  ABSENCE OF UNDISCLOSED LIABILITIES.  All of the obligations or
    liabilities (whether accrued, absolute, contingent, unliquidated or
    otherwise, whether due or to become due, and regardless of when asserted
    ("LIABILITIES"), required to be reflected in the balance sheets of the
    Company and its Subsidiaries in accordance with GAAP have been so reflected,
    except for such Liabilities that would not, individually or in the
    aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company. The Company has no
    Liabilities except (i) as reflected in the consolidated balance sheets of
    the Company and its Subsidiaries as of December 31, 2000 contained in the
    Company's SEC Documents (the "LATEST COMPANY BALANCE SHEET"),
    (ii) Liabilities which have arisen after the date of the Latest Company
    Balance Sheet in the ordinary course of business, none of which is a
    material uninsured liability, (iii) as otherwise Previously Disclosed and
    (iv) Liabilities that would not, individually or in the aggregate, have a
    Material Adverse Effect on the Company.

        (j)  LITIGATION.  Except as Previously Disclosed, no litigation, claim
    or other proceeding before any court or Governmental Authority is pending
    against the Company or any of its Subsidiaries and, to the Company's
    knowledge, no such litigation, claim or other proceeding has been
    threatened, except such litigation, claim or other proceeding that would
    not, individually or in the aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect on the
    Company. None of the Company or its Subsidiaries is subject to any material
    and outstanding order, writ, injunction or decree.

        (k)  COMPLIANCE WITH LAWS; PERMITS.  Except where failure to do or be so
    would not, individually or in the aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect
    on the Company, each of the Company and its Subsidiaries:

           (i) is in compliance with all applicable federal, state, local and
       foreign statutes, laws, regulations, ordinances, rules, judgments, orders
       or decrees applicable thereto or to the employees conducting such
       businesses on behalf of the Company and its Subsidiaries, including
       without limitation the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970 and all
       other applicable laws relating to the business practices of the Company
       and its Subsidiaries;

                                      A-18

           (ii) has all permits, licenses, authorizations, orders and approvals
       of, and has made all filings, applications and registrations with, all
       Governmental Authorities that are required in order to permit it to own
       or lease its properties and to conduct its businesses as presently
       conducted; all such permits, licenses, certificates of authority, orders
       and approvals are in full force and effect and, to the Company's
       knowledge, no suspension or cancellation of any of them is threatened;

          (iii) is in compliance with the provisions of its articles of
       incorporation or association and its by-laws or similar governing
       documents; and

           (iv) has received, since December 31, 1998, no notification or
       communication from any Governmental Authority (A) asserting that the
       Company or any of its Subsidiaries is not in compliance with any of the
       statutes, regulations or ordinances which such Governmental Authority
       enforces, or (B) threatening to revoke any license, franchise, permit or
       governmental authorization.

        (l)  ASSOCIATION REGULATIONS.  Except as Previously Disclosed, or except
    where failure to do or be so would not, individually or in the aggregate,
    have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company, each of the Company and its
    Subsidiaries (i) has obtained all sponsorships that are required to be a
    member of the VISA and MasterCard card associations and any other credit
    card association applicable to the Company or its Subsidiaries (the "CARD

    cancellation of any of them is threatened and the Company is, and to the
    knowledge of the Company, each third party affiliated with the Company or
    any of its Subsidiaries is, in compliance with all applicable by-laws,
    requirements, regulations, operating rules, manuals and standards applicable
    to members of the Card Associations, including such by-laws, requirements,
    regulations, operating rules, manuals and standards applicable to members
    having the Company's or its Subsidiaries' status of registration with the
    Card Associations, except in such instances that would not, individually or
    in the aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company. Neither the
    Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has received any notification or
    communication from any Card Association (i) asserting that the Company or
    any of its Subsidiaries, or any third party affiliated with the Company or
    any of its Subsidiaries, is not in compliance with any of the by-laws,
    requirements, regulations, operating rules, manuals and standards of such
    Card Association, except where such non-compliance would not, individually
    or in the aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company or
    (ii) threatening to revoke any material registration.

        (m)  MATERIAL CONTRACTS; DEFAULTS.  Except as Previously Disclosed and
    except for those agreements and other documents filed as exhibits to the
    Company's SEC Documents, none of the Company or its Subsidiaries is a party
    to, bound by or subject to any agreement, contract, arrangement, commitment
    or understanding (whether written or oral) that is a Material Contract. None
    of the Company or its Subsidiaries is in default and no circumstances exist
    under which by notice or passage of time (or both) it would be in default
    under any Material Contract to which it is a party, by which its assets,
    business, or operations may be bound or affected, or under which it or its
    assets, business, or operations receives benefits, and there has not
    occurred any event that, with the lapse of time or the giving of notice or
    both, would constitute such a default, except such defaults that would not,
    individually or in the aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect on the
    Company. To the Company's knowledge, there has been no default, cancellation
    or breach by any other party to any Material Contract to which the Company
    or any of its Subsidiaries is a party, except for such defaults,
    cancellations or breaches that would not, individually or in the aggregate,
    have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company.

                                      A-19

        (n)  NO BROKERS.  No action has been taken by the Company or any of its
    Subsidiaries that would give rise to any valid claim against any party
    hereto for a brokerage commission, finder's fee or other like payment with
    respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, other than the
    fee to be paid to SSB as Previously Disclosed.

        (o)  EMPLOYEES.  To the Company's knowledge, as of the date of this
    Agreement, there is no announced or anticipated resignation of any key
    employee of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries. The Company has complied
    with all laws relating to the employment of labor, including provisions
    thereof relating to wages, hours, equal opportunity, collective bargaining
    and non-discrimination, except for such non-compliance that would not,
    individually or in the aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect on the
    Company.

        (p)  EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS.

           (i) The Company has Previously Disclosed a complete list of all
       material bonus, vacation, deferred compensation, pension, retirement,
       profit-sharing, thrift, savings, employee stock ownership, all employment
       or severance contracts, all medical, dental, vision, adoption assistance,
       transportation, legal services, death, disability, severance, health and
       life plans, all other employee benefit and fringe benefit plans,
       contracts or arrangements and any "change of control" or similar
       provisions in any plan, contract or arrangement, for which the Company is
       or may be financially liable, which the Company has committed to
       implement, adopt or contribute to in the future or which is currently
       maintained or contributed to by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
       for the benefit of officers, former officers, employees, former
       employees, directors, former directors, or the beneficiaries of any of
       the foregoing (collectively, "COMPENSATION AND BENEFIT PLANS").

           (ii) Complete and accurate copies of the Compensation and Benefit
       Plans, including, but not limited to, any trust instruments and/or
       insurance contracts, if any, forming a part thereof, and all amendments
       thereto have been supplied or made available to Acquirer.

          (iii) Each of the Compensation and Benefit Plans has been administered
       in all material respects in accordance with the terms thereof. All
       "employee benefit plans" within the meaning of Section 3(3) of ERISA,
       other than "multiemployer plans" within the meaning of Section 3(37) of
       ERISA ("MULTIEMPLOYER PLANS"), covering employees or former employees of
       the Company and its Subsidiaries (the "PLANS"), to the extent subject to
       ERISA, are in compliance in all material respects with ERISA, the Code,
       the Americans with Disabilities Act, the Age Discrimination in Employment
       Act and other applicable laws. Each Compensation and Benefit Plan of the
       Company or its Subsidiaries which is an "employee pension benefit plan"
       within the meaning of Section 3(2) of ERISA (a "PENSION PLAN") and which
       is intended to be qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code, is so
       qualified and has received a favorable determination letter from the
       Internal Revenue Service covering all plan terms as to which retroactive
       correction is no longer available under Code Section 401(b), any
       voluntary employees' beneficiary association used to fund Compensation
       and Benefit Plans has received an exemption letter from the Internal
       Revenue Service, and the Company is not aware of any circumstances
       reasonably likely to result in the revocation or disregard of any such
       favorable determination letter. Except in such instances that would not,
       individually or in the aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect on the
       Company, there is no pending or, to its knowledge, threatened litigation
       or governmental audit, examination or investigation relating to the
       Plans.

           (iv) Except in such instances that would not, individually or in the
       aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company, no liability
       under Title IV of ERISA has been or is expected to be incurred by the
       Company or any of its Subsidiaries with respect to any ongoing, frozen or
       terminated "single-employer plan," within the meaning of

                                      A-20

       Section 4001(a)(15) of ERISA, currently or formerly maintained by any of
       them, or the single-employer plan of any entity which is considered one
       employer with it under Section 4001(a)(14) of ERISA or Section 414 of the
       Code (an "ERISA AFFILIATE"). Neither the Company nor any of its present
       or former Subsidiaries nor any ERISA Affiliate of it or any of its
       Subsidiaries presently contributes to a Multiemployer Plan or a multiple
       employer plan (as described in Section 4064(a) of ERISA), nor have they
       contributed to such a plan within this calendar year and the preceding
       five calendar years. No notice of a "reportable event," within the
       meaning of Section 4043 of ERISA for which the 30-day reporting
       requirement has not been waived, has been required to be filed for any
       Pension Plan of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or by any ERISA
       Affiliate within the past 12 months.

           (v) All contributions, premiums and payments required to have been
       made under the terms of any Compensation and Benefit Plan of the Company
       or any of its Subsidiaries have been made, except where failure to do so
       would not, individually or in the aggregate, have a Material Adverse
       Effect on the Company. Neither any Pension Plan of the Company or any of
       its Subsidiaries nor any single-employer plan of an ERISA Affiliate of
       the Company or any of its Subsidiaries has an "accumulated funding
       deficiency" (whether or not waived) within the meaning of Section 412 of
       the Code or Section 302 of ERISA. Neither the Company nor any of its
       Subsidiaries has provided, or is required to provide, security to any
       Pension Plan or to any single-employer plan of an ERISA Affiliate
       pursuant to Section 401(a)(29) of the Code.

           (vi) Under each Pension Plan of the Company or any of its
       Subsidiaries which is a single-employer plan, as of the last day of the
       most recent plan year ended prior to the date hereof, the actuarially
       determined present value of all "benefit liabilities", within the meaning
       of Section 4001(a)(16) of ERISA (as determined on the basis of the
       actuarial assumptions contained in the Pension Plan's most recent
       actuarial valuation) did not exceed the then current value of the assets
       of such Pension Plan, and there has been no adverse change in the
       financial condition of such Pension Plan (with respect to either assets
       or benefits) since the last day of the most recent plan year.

          (vii) None of the Company or its Subsidiaries has any obligations
       under any Compensation and Benefit Plans to provide benefits, including
       death or medical benefits, with respect to employees of it or its
       Subsidiaries beyond their retirement or other termination of service
       other than (A) coverage mandated by Part 6 of Title I of ERISA or
       Section 4980B of the Code, (B) retirement or death benefits under any
       employee pension benefit plan (as defined under Section 3(2) of ERISA),
       (C) disability benefits under any employee welfare plan that have been
       fully provided for by insurance or otherwise, or (D) benefits in the
       nature of severance pay.

         (viii) Except as Previously Disclosed, neither the execution and
       delivery of this Agreement nor the consummation of the transactions
       contemplated hereby will (A) result in any payment (including, without
       limitation, severance, unemployment compensation, golden parachute or
       otherwise) becoming due to any current or former director or employee of
       it or any of its Subsidiaries under any Compensation and Benefit Plan or
       otherwise from it or any of its Subsidiaries, (B) increase any benefits
       otherwise payable under any Compensation and Benefit Plan or (C) result
       in any acceleration of the time of payment or vesting of any such
       benefit, except in such instances that would not, individually or in the
       aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company.

           (ix) Except as Previously Disclosed, no Compensation and Benefit
       Plan, separately or in the aggregate, requires or would result in the
       payment of any "excess parachute payments" within the meaning of
       Section 280G of the Code, and the consummation of the transactions
       contemplated by this Agreement will not be a factor in causing payments
       to be made by

                                      A-21

       Acquirer or the Company that are not deductible (in whole or in part)
       under Section 280G of the Code, except in such instances that would not,
       individually or in the aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect on the
       Company.

        (q)  LABOR MATTERS.  Except as Previously Disclosed, none of the Company
    or its Subsidiaries is a party to nor bound by any collective bargaining
    agreement, contract or other agreement or understanding with a labor union
    or labor organization, nor is it the subject of a proceeding asserting that
    it has committed an unfair labor practice (within the meaning of the
    National Labor Relations Act) or seeking to compel it to bargain with any
    labor organization as to wages or conditions of employment, nor is there any
    strike or other labor dispute involving it or, to the Company's knowledge,
    threatened, nor to the Company's knowledge is there any activity involving
    any employee of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries seeking to certify a
    collective bargaining unit or engaging in other organizational activity.

        (r)  ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS.  Neither the conduct nor operation by the
    Company or its Subsidiaries of its business nor any condition of any
    property presently or previously leased, occupied or operated by any of them
    violates or violated any Environmental Laws, except for such violations
    which would not, individually or in the aggregate, have a Material Adverse
    Effect on the Company. No condition has existed or event has occurred with
    respect to any of them or any such property that, with notice or the passage
    of time, or both, is reasonably likely to result in any liability under
    Environmental Laws, except for liabilities which would not, individually or
    in the aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company. Neither the
    Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has received any written notice from any
    person or entity that the Company or its Subsidiaries or the operation or
    condition of any property ever leased, occupied or operated by any of them
    are or were in violation of or otherwise are alleged to have liability under
    any Environmental Law, including, but not limited to, responsibility (or
    potential responsibility) for the cleanup or other remediation of any
    pollutants, contaminants, or hazardous or toxic wastes, substances or
    materials at, on, beneath, or originating from any such property, except for
    violations or liabilities which would not, individually or in the aggregate,
    have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company. As used in this Agreement,
    "ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS" means all applicable local, state and federal
    environmental, health and safety laws and regulations.

        (s)  INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY.

           (i) The Company and its Subsidiaries own or have the right to use all
       copyrights, trade names, trademarks, service marks, trade secrets,
       know-how, designs, software, patents, licenses and other intellectual
       property rights (collectively, the "INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY") that are
       necessary to conduct the business of the Company and its Subsidiaries as
       presently conducted, other than those rights the absence of which would
       not, individually or in the aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect on
       the Company.

           (ii) As of the date of this Agreement, there is no suit, action or
       proceeding pending or, to the Company's knowledge, threatened against or
       affecting the Company or any of its subsidiaries, which challenges the
       legality, validity, enforceability of, or the Company's or any of its
       Subsidiaries' use or ownership of, any of the Intellectual Property owned
       by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or, to the Company's knowledge,
       licensed to the Company or to any of its Subsidiaries, other than any
       such suit, action or proceeding that would not have, individually or in
       the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on the Company.

          (iii) The conduct of the Company's and its Subsidiaries' business, the
       Intellectual Property owned or used by the Company and its Subsidiaries
       and the products or services produced, sold or licensed by the Company
       and its Subsidiaries do not infringe, violate or misappropriate any
       Intellectual Property right or any other proprietary right of any person
       or give rise to any obligations to any person as a result of
       co-authorship, co-investorship, or any

                                      A-22

       express or implied contract for any use or transfer, other than any such
       infringement, violation or appropriation that would not, individually or
       in the aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company.

        (t)  TAX MATTERS.  Except in such instances where failure to do or be so
    would not, individually or in the aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect
    on the Company:

           (i) Each of the Company and its Subsidiaries and all members of any
       consolidated, affiliated, combined or unitary group of which the Company
       or any of its Subsidiaries is or at any time was a member have filed all
       Tax Returns required to be filed (taking into account permissible
       extensions) by them on or prior to the date hereof, and have paid all
       Taxes relating to the time periods covered by such returns and reports.
       The accrued taxes payable accounts for Taxes reflected on the Latest
       Company Balance Sheet (or the notes thereto) are sufficient for the
       payment of all unpaid Taxes of the Company and its Subsidiaries accrued
       for or applicable to all periods ended on or prior to the date of the
       Latest Company Balance Sheet or which may subsequently be determined to
       be owing with respect to any such period. None of the Company or its
       Subsidiaries has waived any statute of limitations with respect to Taxes
       or agreed to any extension of time with respect to an assessment or
       deficiency for Taxes. Each of the Company and its Subsidiaries has paid
       or will pay in a timely manner and as required by law all Taxes due and
       payable by it or which it is obligated to withhold from amounts owing to
       any employee or third party. All Taxes which will be due and payable,
       whether now or hereafter, for any period ending on, prior to or including
       the Effective Time, shall have been paid by or on behalf of the Company
       and its Subsidiaries or shall be reflected on the books of the Company
       and its Subsidiaries as an accrued Tax liability determined in a manner
       which is consistent with past practices and the Latest Company Balance
       Sheet, without taking account of the Merger. There are no unresolved
       questions, claims or disputes asserted by any relevant taxing authority
       concerning the liability for Taxes of the Company or any of its
       Subsidiaries. None of the Company or its Subsidiaries has made an
       election under Section 341(f) of the Code for any taxable years not yet
       closed for statute of limitations purposes. Since December 31, 1995, no
       demand or claim has been made against the Company or any of its
       Subsidiaries with respect to any Taxes arising out of membership or
       participation in any consolidated, affiliated, combined or unitary group
       of which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries was at any time a member.
       The Company has no reason to believe that any conditions exist that might
       prevent or impede the Merger from qualifying as a reorganization within
       the meaning of Section 368 of the Code.

        (u)  BOOKS AND RECORDS.  The books and records of each of the Company
    and its Significant Subsidiaries prepared on or after December 31, 1998,
    have been fully, properly and accurately maintained in all material
    respects, and there are no material inaccuracies or discrepancies of any
    kind contained or reflected therein.

        (v)  INSURANCE.  The Company has Previously Disclosed each material
    insurance policy maintained by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries with
    respect to its properties and assets. Prior to the date hereof, the Company
    has provided or made available to Acquirer complete and, in all material
    respects, accurate copies of each of the insurance policies described on the
    Company's Disclosure Schedule. All such insurance policies are in full force
    and effect, in all material respects, and the Company is not in material
    default with respect to its material obligations under any of such insurance
    policies.

        (w)  TAKEOVER LAWS; RIGHTS AGREEMENT.  The Company has taken all action
    required to be taken by it in order to exempt this Agreement and the
    transactions contemplated hereby from the requirements of any applicable
    "moratorium", "control share", "fair price," "business combination" or other
    antitakeover laws and regulations of any state (collectively, "TAKEOVER

                                      A-23

    LAWS"). The Company has taken all action and completed all amendments to the
    Rights Agreement necessary so that the execution and delivery of this
    Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby do
    not and will not, with or without the passage of time, result in (i) the
    grant of any Rights to any Person under the Rights Agreement or enable or
    require the Company's outstanding Rights to be exercised, distributed or
    triggered, (ii) Acquirer becoming an "Acquiring Person" (as defined in the
    Rights Agreement), or (iii) the occurrence of a "Distribution Date" or
    "Stock Acquisition Date" (as defined in the Rights Agreement).

    5.03  REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF ACQUIRER.  Acquirer hereby
represents and warrants to the Company as follows:

        (a)  ORGANIZATION, STANDING AND AUTHORITY.  Acquirer is a corporation
    duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the
    State of Delaware. Acquirer is duly registered as a bank holding company
    under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended. Acquirer and each of
    its Significant Subsidiaries is duly licensed and qualified to do business
    and is in good standing in the states of the United States and any foreign
    jurisdictions where its ownership or leasing of property or assets or the
    conduct of its business requires it to be so licensed and qualified, except
    where the failure to be so licensed and qualified would not, individually or
    in the aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect on Acquirer. Acquirer has
    in effect all federal, state, local and foreign governmental authorizations
    necessary for it to own or lease its properties and assets and to carry on
    its business as it is now conducted, except where the failure to have such
    authorizations in effect would not, individually or in the aggregate, have a
    Material Adverse Effect on Acquirer.

        (b)  ACQUIRER CAPITAL STOCK.  As of the date of this Agreement, the
    authorized capital stock of Acquirer consists solely of 4,000,000,000 shares
    of Acquirer Common Stock and 50,000,000 shares of preferred stock, par value
    $1.00 per share ("ACQUIRER PREFERRED STOCK"). As of April 30, 2001, there
    were 1,907,945,380 shares of Acquirer Common Stock and 55,696 shares of
    Acquirer Preferred Stock issued and outstanding. As of such date, 2,685,147
    shares of Acquirer Common Stock were held in treasury by Acquirer or
    otherwise owned by Acquirer. As of the date of this Agreement, no shares of
    Acquirer Common Stock or Acquirer Preferred Stock were reserved for
    issuance, except that 207,200,000 shares of Acquirer Common Stock were
    reserved for issuance pursuant to Acquirer's employee and director stock
    purchase and option plans and dividend reinvestment plan, 260,768 shares
    were reserved for issuance under outstanding warrants to purchase Acquirer
    Common Stock. As of the date of this Agreement, 890 shares of Acquirer
    Preferred Stock were reserved for issuance. All of the issued and
    outstanding shares of Acquirer Common Stock have been duly authorized and
    validly issued and are fully paid, nonassessable and free of preemptive
    rights, with no personal liability attaching to the ownership thereof. As of
    the date of this Agreement, except as referred to above, Acquirer does not
    have any Rights issued or outstanding with respect to any shares of Acquirer
    Common Stock or Acquirer Preferred Stock or any other equity securities of
    Acquirer. The shares of Acquirer Common Stock to be issued pursuant to the
    Merger will be duly authorized and validly issued and, at the Effective
    Time, all such shares will be fully paid, nonassessable and free of
    preemptive rights, with no personal liability attaching to the ownership
    thereof.

        (c)  CORPORATE POWER.  Each of Acquirer and its Subsidiaries has the
    corporate power and authority to carry on its business as it is now being
    conducted and to own all of its properties and assets; and Acquirer has the
    corporate power and authority to execute, deliver and perform its
    obligations under this Agreement and to consummate the transactions
    contemplated hereby.

        (d)  CORPORATE AUTHORITY.  This Agreement and the transactions
    contemplated hereby have been authorized by all necessary corporate action
    of each of Acquirer and the Acquirer Board on or prior to the date hereof
    and no other corporate proceedings on the part of Acquirer are

                                      A-24

    necessary to authorize this Agreement and the transactions contemplated
    hereby. This Agreement is a valid and legally binding agreement of Acquirer,
    enforceable in accordance with its terms (except as enforceability may be
    limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium,
    fraudulent transfer and similar laws of general applicability relating to or
    affecting creditors' rights or by general equity principles).

        (e)  REGULATORY APPROVALS; NO DEFAULTS.

           (i) No consents or approvals of, or filings or registrations with,
       any Governmental Authority or with any third party are required to be
       made or obtained by Acquirer or any of its Subsidiaries in connection
       with the execution, delivery or performance by Acquirer of this Agreement
       or to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby, where failure to
       obtain such consents or approvals or to make such filings and
       registrations would, individually or in the aggregate, have a Material
       Adverse Effect on Acquirer, except for: (A) the filings and applicable
       requirements under the HSR Act with respect to both this Agreement and
       the LLC Buyout Agreement; (B) filings with the SEC and state securities
       authorities and the approval of the listing on the NYSE of Acquirer
       Common Stock to be issued in the Merger; and (C) the filing of the
       certificate of merger as contemplated in Section 2.01(b). As of the date
       hereof, Acquirer is not aware of any reason why the approvals set forth
       in Section 7.01(b) will not be received.

           (ii) Subject to receipt of the regulatory approvals referred to in
       the preceding paragraph and the expiration of related waiting periods,
       and required filings under federal and state securities laws, the
       execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement and the
       consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby do not and will not:

               (A) constitute a breach or violation of, a default under, result
           in the loss of any benefit under or give rise to any Lien, penalty,
           acceleration of performance or remedies or any right of termination
           under, any law, rule or regulation or any judgment, decree, order,
           governmental permit or license, or agreement, indenture, deed of
           trust, note, bond, mortgage, lease or other instrument of Acquirer or
           of any of its Subsidiaries or to which Acquirer or any of its
           Subsidiaries or any of their respective properties is subject or
           bound, except in such instances that would not, individually or in
           the aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect on Acquirer; or

               (B) constitute a breach or violation of, or a default under, the
           certificate of incorporation or by-laws (or similar governing
           documents) of Acquirer or any of its Subsidiaries.

        (f)  FINANCIAL REPORTS AND SEC DOCUMENTS.  The SEC Documents of Acquirer
    or any of its Subsidiaries, as of the date filed: (i) complied or will
    comply in all material respects as to form with the applicable requirements
    under the Securities Act or the Exchange Act, as the case may be, and
    (ii) did not and will not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or
    omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to
    make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they
    were made, not misleading, except that information as of a later date (but
    before the date hereof) shall be deemed to supersede information of an
    earlier date; and each of the balance sheets contained in or incorporated by
    reference into any such SEC Document of Acquirer or any of its Subsidiaries,
    including the related notes and schedules thereto, fairly presents and will
    fairly present, in all material respects, the financial position of the
    entity or entities to which it relates as of its date, and each of the
    statements of income and changes in shareholders' equity and cash flows or
    equivalent statements in such SEC Documents of Acquirer or any of its
    Subsidiaries (including any related notes and schedules thereto) fairly
    presents and will fairly present, in all material respects, the results of
    operations, changes in shareholders' equity and changes in cash flows, as
    the case may be, of the entity or entities to which it relates for the

                                      A-25

    periods to which they relate, in each case in accordance with GAAP
    consistently applied during the periods involved, except in each case as may
    be noted therein, subject to normal year-end audit adjustments in the case
    of unaudited statements.

        (g)  NO MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT.  Since December 31, 2000, no event has
    occurred or circumstance arisen that, individually or in the aggregate, has
    had or will have a Material Adverse Effect with respect to Acquirer.

        (h)  TAX MATTERS.  Except in such instances where failure to do or be so
    would not, individually or in the aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect
    on Acquirer:

           (i) Each of Acquirer and its Subsidiaries and all members of any
       consolidated, affiliated, combined or unitary group of which Acquirer or
       any of its Subsidiaries is or at any time was a member have filed all Tax
       Returns required to be filed (taking into account permissible extensions)
       by them on or prior to the date hereof, and have paid all Taxes relating
       to the time periods covered by such returns and reports. Each of Acquirer
       and its Subsidiaries has paid in a timely manner and as required by law
       all Taxes due and payable by it or which it is obligated to withhold from
       amounts owing to any employee or third party. There are no unresolved
       questions, claims or disputes asserted by any relevant taxing authority
       concerning the liability for Taxes of Acquirer or any of its
       Subsidiaries. None of Acquirer or its Subsidiaries has made an election
       under Section 341(f) of the Code for any taxable years not yet closed for
       statute of limitations purposes. Since December 31, 1995, no demand or
       claim has been made against Acquirer or any of its Subsidiaries with
       respect to any Taxes arising out of membership or participation in any
       consolidated, affiliated, combined or unitary group of which Acquirer or
       any of its Subsidiaries was at any time a member. As of the date hereof,
       Acquirer has no reason to believe that any conditions exist that might
       prevent or impede the Merger from qualifying as a reorganization within
       the meaning of Section 368 of the Code.

        (i)  LITIGATION.  No litigation, claim or other proceeding before any
    court or Governmental Authority is pending against Acquirer or any of its
    Subsidiaries and, to Acquirer's knowledge, no such litigation, claim or
    other proceeding has been threatened, except such litigation, claim or other
    proceeding that would not, individually or in the aggregate, have a Material
    Adverse Effect on Acquirer. None of Acquirer or its Subsidiaries is subject
    to any material and outstanding order, writ, injunction or decree.

        (j)  REGULATORY MATTERS.  Except in such instances that would not,
    individually or in the aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect on
    Acquirer:

           (i) None of Acquirer or its Subsidiaries or any of their properties
       is a party to or subject to any order, decree, agreement, memorandum of
       understanding or similar arrangement with, or a commitment letter or
       similar submission to, or extraordinary supervisory letter from, any
       Governmental Authority charged with the supervision or regulation of
       financial institutions or issuers of securities or engaged in the
       insurance of deposits (including, without limitation, the OCC, the FRB,
       the FDIC and/or any other State regulatory agencies) (collectively, the
       "REGULATORY AUTHORITIES").

           (ii) None of Acquirer or its Subsidiaries has been advised by any
       Regulatory Authority that such Regulatory Authority is contemplating
       issuing or requesting (or is considering the appropriateness of issuing
       or requesting) any such order, decree, agreement, memorandum of
       understanding, commitment letter, supervisory letter or similar
       submission.

                                      A-26

          (iii) Since December 31, 1998, each of Acquirer and its Subsidiaries
       has filed each report or other filing that it was required to file with
       any federal or state banking or other applicable Regulatory Authorities
       having jurisdiction over it (together with all exhibits thereto, the
       "ACQUIRER REGULATORY REPORTS"). As of their respective dates or as
       subsequently amended prior to the date hereof, each of the Acquirer
       Regulatory Reports was true and correct and complied in all material
       respects with the requirements of the applicable form for each such
       Acquirer Regulatory Report.

        (k)  COMPLIANCE WITH LAWS; PERMITS.  Except where failure to do or be so
    would not, individually or in the aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect
    on Acquirer, each of Acquirer and its Subsidiaries:

           (i) is in compliance with all applicable federal, state, local and
       foreign statutes, laws, regulations, ordinances, rules, judgments, orders
       or decrees applicable thereto or to the employees conducting such

       conducted; all such permits, licenses, certificates of authority, orders
       and approvals are in full force and effect and, to Acquirer's knowledge,
       no suspension or cancellation of any of them is threatened;

       communication from any Governmental Authority (A) asserting that Acquirer
       or any of its Subsidiaries is not in compliance with any of the statutes,
       regulations or ordinances which such Governmental Authority enforces, or
       (B) threatening to revoke any license, franchise, permit or governmental
       authorization.

                                   ARTICLE VI

    6.03  REGISTRATION STATEMENT.

        (a)  REGISTRATION STATEMENT.  Acquirer and the Company agree to
    cooperate in the preparation of a registration statement on Form S-4 or
    other applicable form (the "REGISTRATION STATEMENT") to be filed by Acquirer
    with the SEC in connection with the issuance of Acquirer Common Stock in the
    Merger (including the proxy statement and prospectus and other proxy

    reasonably practicable after filing thereof. Acquirer also agrees to use
    reasonable best efforts to obtain all necessary state securities law or
    "Blue Sky" permits and approvals required to carry out the transactions
    contemplated by this Agreement. The Company agrees to furnish to Acquirer
    all information concerning the Company, its officers, directors and
    shareholders as may be reasonably requested in connection with the
    foregoing.

        (b)  QUALITY OF INFORMATION.  Each of the Company and Acquirer agrees
    that none of the information supplied or to be supplied by it for inclusion
    or incorporation by reference in:

           (i) the Registration Statement will, at the time the Registration
       Statement and each amendment or supplement thereto, if any, becomes
       effective under the Securities Act, contain any untrue statement of a
       material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated
       therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, and

           (ii) the Proxy Statement and any amendment or supplement thereto
       will, at the date of mailing to shareholders and at the time of the
       Company Meeting, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit
       to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to
       make the statements therein not misleading or any statement which, in the
       light of the circumstances under which such statement is made, will be
       false or misleading with respect to any material fact, or which will omit
       to state any material fact necessary in order to make the statements
       therein not false or misleading or necessary to correct any statement in
       any earlier statement in the Proxy Statement or any amendment or
       supplement thereto.

        Each of the Company and Acquirer further agrees that if it shall become
    aware prior to the Effective Date of any information furnished by it that
    would cause any of the statements in the Proxy Statement to be false or
    misleading with respect to any material fact, or that it has omitted to
    state any material fact necessary to make the statements therein not false
    or misleading, it shall promptly inform the other party thereof and to take
    the necessary steps to correct the Proxy Statement and the Registration
    Statement.

        (c)  NOTICES REGARDING REGISTRATION.  Acquirer agrees to advise the
    Company, promptly after Acquirer receives notice thereof, of the time when
    the Registration Statement has become effective or any supplement or
    amendment has been filed, of the issuance of any stop order or the
    suspension of the qualification of Acquirer Common Stock for offering or
    sale in any jurisdiction, of the initiation or threat of any proceeding for
    any such purpose, or of any request by the SEC for the amendment or
    supplement of the Registration Statement or for additional information.

    6.04  PRESS RELEASES.  Each of the Company and Acquirer agrees that it will
not, without the prior approval of the other party, issue any press release or
written statement for general circulation relating to the transactions
contemplated hereby, except as otherwise required by applicable law or
regulation or rules of the stock market where its securities are traded
(provided that the issuing party shall nevertheless provide the other party with
notice of, and the opportunity to review, any such press release or written
statement).

                                      A-28

    6.05  ACCESS; INFORMATION.

        (a)  ACCESS.  The Company agrees that upon reasonable notice, it shall
    afford Acquirer and Acquirer's officers, employees, counsel, accountants and
    other authorized representatives, such reasonable access during normal
    business hours throughout the period prior to the Effective Time to the
    books, records (including, without limitation, tax returns and work papers
    of independent auditors), properties, personnel and to such other
    information as Acquirer may reasonably request and, during such period, the
    Company shall furnish promptly to Acquirer (i) a copy of each material
    report, schedule and other document filed by it pursuant to the requirements
    of federal or state securities laws, and (ii) all other information
    concerning the business, properties and personnel of it as Acquirer may
    reasonably request. The Company shall not be required to provide access to
    or to disclose information where such access or disclosure would violate or
    prejudice the rights of its customers, jeopardize any attorney-client
    privilege or contravene any law, rule, regulation, order, judgment, decree,
    fiduciary duty or binding agreement entered into prior to the date of this
    Agreement. The parties hereto will make appropriate substitute disclosure
    arrangements under circumstances in which the restrictions of the preceding
    sentence apply.

        (b)  CONFIDENTIALITY.  All information furnished to Acquirer pursuant to
    Section 6.05(a) shall be subject to, and Acquirer shall hold all such
    information in confidence in accordance with, the provisions of the Mutual
    Nondisclosure Agreement dated February 6, 2001 (the "CONFIDENTIALITY
    AGREEMENT") between U.S. Bank National Association and the Company. The
    Company shall have the same obligations to Acquirer with respect to
    information furnished to the Company by Acquirer.

        (c)  INVESTIGATION.  No investigation by either party of the business
    and affairs of the other party shall affect or be deemed to modify or waive
    any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement in this Agreement, or
    the conditions to either party's obligation to consummate the transactions
    contemplated by this Agreement.

    6.06  ACQUISITION PROPOSALS.

        (a) The Company shall not, and shall cause its Subsidiaries and its
    Subsidiaries' officers, directors, agents, advisors and affiliates not to,
    solicit or encourage inquiries or proposals with respect to, or engage in
    any negotiations concerning, or provide any confidential information to, or
    have any discussions with, any person relating to, any Takeover Proposal.
    The Company shall immediately cease and cause to be terminated any
    activities, discussions or negotiations conducted prior to the date of this
    Agreement with any parties other than Acquirer with respect to any of the
    foregoing. The Company shall promptly (within 24 hours) advise Acquirer
    following the receipt by the Company of any Takeover Proposal and the
    substance thereof (including the identity of the person making such Takeover
    Proposal), and advise the Acquirer of any developments with respect to such
    Takeover Proposal immediately upon the occurrence thereof. Notwithstanding
    the first sentence of this Section 6.06(a), in the event that the Company
    Board determines in good faith and after considering the advice of outside
    legal counsel (who may be its regularly engaged outside legal counsel),
    after the Company has received an unsolicited Takeover Proposal that is a
    Superior Proposal, that the failure to do so would result in a breach of the
    Company Board's fiduciary duties to the Company's shareholders, the Company
    may, in response to an unsolicited request therefor, furnish information
    with respect to the Company to, and enter into discussions with, the party
    making the Superior Proposal pursuant to a customary confidentiality
    agreement.

        (b) Except as expressly permitted by this Section 6.06(b), the Company
    Board may not (i) withdraw or modify in a manner adverse to Acquirer, the
    approval or recommendation by the Company Board of the Merger or this
    Agreement, (ii) approve or recommend any Takeover Proposal, or (iii) cause
    or authorize the Company to enter into any letter of intent, agreement in
    principle, acquisition agreement or other similar agreement relating to any
    Takeover Proposal.

                                      A-29

    Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that prior to the date of the
    Company Meeting, the Company Board determines in good faith, after the
    Company has received a Superior Proposal and after considering the advice of
    outside legal counsel (who may be its regularly engaged outside legal
    counsel), that failure to do so would result in a breach of its fiduciary
    duties to the Company's shareholders under applicable law, the Company Board
    may upon not less than three business days notice to Acquirer of the Company
    Board's intention to do so take any of the actions specified in (i) through
    (iii) of the first sentence of this Section 6.06(b) in order concurrently to
    enter into a definitive agreement with respect to a Superior Proposal,
    provided it shall, concurrently with entering into such agreement, terminate
    this Agreement pursuant to the provisions of Section 8.01(g) hereof and pay
    or cause to be paid to Acquirer the Termination Fee required by
    Section 8.03 hereof.

    6.07  AFFILIATE AGREEMENTS.  The Company shall use its reasonable best
efforts to cause each director, executive officer and other Person who is an
"affiliate" (for purposes of Rule 145 under the Securities Act) of the Company
to execute and deliver to Acquirer on or before the date of mailing of the Proxy
Statement a written agreement in the form of EXHIBIT A hereto.

    6.08  STOCK EXCHANGE LISTING.  Acquirer agrees to use its reasonable best
efforts to list, prior to the Effective Date, on the NYSE, subject to official
notice of issuance, the shares of Acquirer Common Stock to be issued to the
holders of Company Common Stock in the Merger, other than any shares to be
issued out of Acquirer's treasury for which such listing is not required.

    6.09  REGULATORY APPLICATIONS.

        (a)  COOPERATION WITH FILINGS.  The Company and Acquirer and their
    respective Subsidiaries shall cooperate and use their respective reasonable
    best efforts (i) to promptly prepare all documentation, to effect all
    filings and to obtain all permits, consents, approvals and authorizations of
    all third parties and Governmental Authorities necessary to consummate the
    transactions contemplated by this Agreement (including, without limitation,
    the consummation of the transactions contemplated by the LLC Buyout
    Agreement, if applicable), including, without limitation, any such approvals
    or authorizations required pursuant to the HSR Act (including, without
    limitation, in connection with the LLC Buyout Agreement, if applicable), and
    (ii) to cause the Merger to be consummated as expeditiously as reasonably
    practicable. The Company agrees that separate filings will be made pursuant
    to the HSR Act for the Merger and the transactions contemplated by the LLC
    Agreement, if applicable. Each of Acquirer and the Company shall have the
    right to review in advance, and to the extent practicable each will consult
    with the other, in each case subject to applicable laws relating to the
    exchange of information, with respect to, all material written information
    submitted to any third party or any Governmental Authority in connection
    with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. In exercising the
    foregoing right, each of the parties hereto agrees to act reasonably and as
    promptly as practicable. Each party hereto agrees that it will consult with
    the other party hereto with respect to the obtaining of all material
    permits, consents, approvals and authorizations of all third parties and
    Governmental Authorities necessary or advisable to consummate the
    transactions contemplated by this Agreement and each party will keep the
    other party apprised of the status of material matters relating to
    completion of the transactions contemplated hereby.

        (b)  AGREEMENT TO FURNISH INFORMATION.  Each party agrees, upon request,
    to furnish the other party with all information concerning itself, its
    Subsidiaries, directors, officers and shareholders and such other matters as
    may be reasonably necessary or advisable in connection with any filing,
    notice or application made by or on behalf of such other party or any of its
    Subsidiaries to any third party or Governmental Authority. Any such
    information that is not ultimately included in any publicly available
    filing, notice or application shall be kept confidential in accordance with
    Section 6.05(b).

                                      A-30

    6.10  INDEMNIFICATION; DIRECTORS' AND OFFICERS' INSURANCE.

        (a)  INDEMNIFICATION BY ACQUIRER.  From and after the Effective Time,
    Acquirer agrees to indemnify and hold harmless each present and former
    director and officer of the Company and its Subsidiaries determined as of
    the Effective Time (the "INDEMNIFIED PARTIES"), against any costs or
    expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees), judgments, fines, losses,
    claims, damages or liabilities (collectively, "COSTS") incurred in
    connection with any actual or threatened claim, action, suit, proceeding or
    investigation, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative,
    arising out of matters existing or occurring at or prior to the Effective
    Time (including with respect to this Agreement or any of the transactions
    contemplated hereby) to the fullest extent permitted by law. Acquirer shall
    also advance expenses as incurred to the fullest extent permitted under
    Delaware law, upon receipt of any undertaking required by applicable law.

        (b)  INDEMNIFICATION PROCEDURE.  Any Indemnified Party wishing to claim
    indemnification under Section 6.10(a), upon learning of any such claim,
    action, suit, proceeding or investigation, shall as promptly as possible
    notify Acquirer thereof, but the failure to so notify shall not relieve
    Acquirer of any liability it may have to such Indemnified Party if such
    failure does not materially prejudice Acquirer. In the event of any such
    claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation (whether arising before or
    after the Effective Time):

           (i) Acquirer shall have the right to assume the defense thereof and
       Acquirer shall not be liable to such Indemnified Parties for any legal
       expenses of other counsel or any other expenses subsequently incurred by
       such Indemnified Parties in connection with the defense thereof, except
       that if Acquirer elects not to assume such defense or counsel for the
       Indemnified Parties advises in writing that there are issues which raise
       conflicts of interest between Acquirer and the Indemnified Parties, the
       Indemnified Parties may retain counsel satisfactory to them, and Acquirer
       shall pay the reasonable fees and expenses of one such counsel for the
       Indemnified Parties in any jurisdiction promptly as statements thereof
       are received;

           (ii) the Indemnified Parties will cooperate in the defense of any
       such matter; and

          (iii) Acquirer shall not be liable for any settlement effected without
       its prior written consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably
       withheld); and provided, further, that Acquirer shall not have any
       obligation hereunder to any Indemnified Party when and if a court of
       competent jurisdiction shall ultimately determine, and such determination
       shall have become final and nonappealable, that the indemnification of
       such Indemnified Party in the manner contemplated hereby is not permitted
       or is prohibited by applicable law.

        (c)  DIRECTORS' AND OFFICERS' LIABILITY INSURANCE.  For a period of six
    years after the Effective Date, Acquirer shall use its best efforts to
    provide that portion of directors' and officers' liability insurance that
    serves to reimburse officers and directors of the Company or any of its
    Subsidiaries (determined as of the Effective Time) with respect to claims
    against such officers and directors arising from facts or events which
    occurred on or before the Effective Time of at least the same coverage and
    amounts, and containing terms and conditions no less advantageous, as that
    coverage currently provided by the Company; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that in no
    event shall Acquirer be required to expend more than 300% per annum of the
    current amount expended by the Company (the "INSURANCE AMOUNT") to maintain
    or procure such directors and officers insurance coverage; PROVIDED,
    FURTHER, that if Acquirer is unable to obtain the insurance called for by
    this Section 6.10(c), Acquirer shall use its reasonable best efforts to
    obtain as much comparable insurance as is available for the Insurance
    Amount; and PROVIDED, FURTHER, that officers and directors of the Company or
    any of its Subsidiaries may be required to make application and provide
    customary representations and warranties to Acquirer's insurance carrier for
    the purpose of obtaining such insurance.

                                      A-31

        (d)  SUCCESSOR LIABILITY.  If Acquirer or any of its successors or
    assigns (i) shall consolidate with or merge into any other corporation or
    entity and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of
    such consolidation or merger or (ii) shall transfer all or substantially all
    of its properties and assets to any individual, corporation or other entity,
    then and in each such case, proper provision shall be made so that the
    successors and assigns of Acquirer shall assume the obligations set forth in
    this Section 6.10.

    6.11  TAKEOVER LAWS; NO RIGHT TRIGGERED; NO AMENDMENT TO RIGHTS AGREEMENT.

        (a) No party shall take any action that would cause the transactions
    contemplated by this Agreement to be subject to requirements imposed by any
    Takeover Law and each of them shall take all necessary steps within its
    control to exempt (or ensure the continued exemption of) the transactions
    contemplated by this Agreement from, or if necessary challenge the validity
    or applicability of, any applicable Takeover Law, as now or hereafter in
    effect that purport to apply to this Agreement or the transactions
    contemplated hereby.

        (b) The Company shall take all reasonable steps necessary to ensure that
    the entering into of this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions
    contemplated hereby and any other action or combination of actions, or any
    other transactions contemplated hereby, do not and will not result in the
    grant of any Rights to any Person (i) under the Company Articles or Company
    By-Laws, (ii) under the Rights Agreement or (iii) under any other material
    agreement to which it or any of its Subsidiaries is a party (except as
    expressly contemplated by the mandatory provisions under the Compensation
    and Benefit Plans).

        (c) Except as expressly contemplated in this Agreement, the Company
    shall not (i) amend the Rights Agreement in any manner, or (ii) unless
    required to do so by a final, nonappealable judgment of a court of competent
    jurisdiction, redeem any Right under the Rights Agreement without the prior
    written consent of Acquirer.

    6.12  NOTIFICATION OF CERTAIN MATTERS.  Each of the Company and Acquirer
shall give prompt notice to the other of any fact, event or circumstance known
to it that:

           (i) individually or taken together with all other facts, events and
       circumstances known to it, has had or will have a Material Adverse
       Effect, or

           (ii) would cause or constitute a material breach of any of its
       representations, warranties, covenants or agreements contained herein.

    6.13  ACCOUNTANTS' LETTERS.  Each of Acquirer and the Company shall use its
reasonable best efforts to cause to be delivered to the other party, and such
other party's directors and officers who sign the Registration Statement, a
letter of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP and Ernst & Young LLP, respectively,
independent auditors, dated (i) the date on which the Registration Statement
shall become effective and (ii) a date shortly prior to the Effective Date, and
addressed to such other party, and such directors and officers, in form and
substance customary for "comfort" letters delivered by independent accountants
in accordance with Statement of Accounting Standards No. 72.

    6.14  TAX MATTERS.  The Company shall file (or cause to be filed) at its own
expense, on or prior to the due date, all Tax returns of the Company and its
Subsidiaries, including all Compensation and Benefit Plan returns and reports,
for all Tax periods ending on or before the Effective Time where the due date
for such returns or reports (taking into account valid extensions of the
respective due dates) falls on or before the Effective Time; PROVIDED, HOWEVER,
that the Company shall not file (and shall cause not to be filed) any such Tax
returns, or other returns, elections or information statements with respect to
any liabilities for Taxes (other than federal, state or local sales, use,
withholding or employment tax returns or statements), or consent to any
adjustment or otherwise compromise or settle any matters with respect to Taxes
outside the ordinary course of business, without prior consultation

                                      A-32

with Acquirer; PROVIDED, FURTHER, that the Company shall not make (and shall
cause not to be made) any election or take any other discretionary position with
respect to Taxes, in a manner inconsistent with past practices, without the
prior written approval of Acquirer.

    6.15  BENEFIT PLANS.

        (a) From time to time after the Effective Date, Acquirer may, at its
    sole discretion subject to the terms of each Compensation and Benefit Plan,
    cause all or any of the Compensation and Benefit Plans maintained by the
    Company to be discontinued or amended, so long as the standard set forth in
    the next sentence is still met by the aggregate of any remaining
    Compensation and Benefit Plans and any other compensation and employee
    benefit plans of Acquirer, the Surviving Corporation, or the Surviving
    Corporation's subsidiaries that are provided to the Continuing Employees. If
    any Compensation and Benefit Plans maintained by the Company are so
    discontinued or amended, Acquirer shall cause Continuing Employees to be
    provided with compensation and employee benefit plans that are no less
    favorable in the aggregate than those provided to other similarly situated
    employees of Acquirer or the Surviving Corporation and their respective
    subsidiaries. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the foregoing, it
    is understood and agreed that Acquirer shall provide severance benefits
    under the General Severance Pay Program of Acquirer for at least one year
    after the Effective Date (rather than any other severance pay program that
    Acquirer may now maintain or hereafter establish, or the severance pay
    program of the Company). As used in this Agreement, "CONTINUING EMPLOYEES"
    means former employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries who, on the
    Effective Date, become employees of Acquirer, the Surviving Corporation or
    the Surviving Corporation's subsidiaries.

        (b) If a Continuing Employee becomes a participant in any compensation
    or employee benefit plan of Acquirer, the Surviving Corporation, or the
    Surviving Corporation's subsidiaries, for which service is taken into
    account or recognized, such Continuing Employee shall be given credit under
    such plan for all service with the Company or its Subsidiaries from not
    later than the Continuing Employee's most recent date of hire prior to the
    Effective Date by the Company or its Subsidiary, as the case may be (as
    provided by the Company to Acquirer prior to the Effective Date) for
    purposes of eligibility, vesting and determining benefit accruals and the
    rate of benefit accruals (except that credit shall not be given for purposes
    of determining benefit accruals and the rate of benefit accruals under
    pension and other retirement plans), provided that there be shall be no
    obligation to duplicate any benefits provided under any Compensation and
    Benefit Plan of the Company or its Subsidiaries that continues in effect
    following the Effective Date.

        (c) This Section 6.15 is an agreement solely between the Company and
    Acquirer. Nothing in this Section 6.15, whether express or implied, shall be
    considered to be a contract with any other person, or shall confer upon any
    employee of the Company, the Company's Subsidiaries, the Acquirer, the
    Surviving Corporation, or the Surviving Corporation's subsidiaries, any
    rights or remedies that such person did not already have, including, but not
    limited to: (i) any right to employment or recall, (ii) any right to
    continued employment, or (iii) any right to claim any particular
    compensation, benefit or aggregation of benefits of any kind or nature
    whatsoever.

    6.16  CURRENT EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENTS.  If any Employment Agreement (as
defined below) is terminated prior to the Effective Time, and the respective
employee party thereto would not otherwise be bound by the non-disclosure,
nonsolicitation and noncompetition covenants set forth therein for a two-year
period following the date of termination of employment, the Company agrees to
exercise the "Two Year Option" provided for therein with respect to such
employee. For purposes of this Section 6.16, "EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENTS" shall mean
those separate agreements entered into between the Company and each of Cherie M.
Fuzzell, Edward Grzedzinski, Pamela A. Joseph, David M. McMiller and Steve M.
Scheppmann, each effective as of February 22, 2001.

                    CONDITIONS TO CONSUMMATION OF THE MERGER

    7.01  CONDITIONS TO EACH PARTY'S OBLIGATION TO EFFECT THE MERGER.  The
respective obligation of each of Acquirer and the Company to consummate the
Merger is subject to the fulfillment or written waiver by Acquirer and the
Company prior to the Effective Time of each of the following conditions:
