                 MERGER PROPOSED -- YOUR VOTE IS VERY IMPORTANT

     The boards of directors of Pride International, Inc. and Marine Drilling
Companies, Inc. have each unanimously approved a transaction that will combine
the two companies. The boards of directors of Pride and Marine believe that the
combined company, as a larger entity with a substantially larger equity market
capitalization and a strong balance sheet, will command a higher valuation in
the stock market and be a stronger competitor than either company would be on a
stand-alone basis. We believe that the transaction will benefit the shareholders
of both companies, and we ask for your support in voting for the merger
proposals at our meetings.

     When the mergers are completed, shareholders of Marine will own one share
of "New Pride," a Delaware corporation to be named Pride International, Inc.
that has been formed to become the successor of the combined companies, for each
share of Marine common stock they currently own. Shareholders of Pride also will
own one share of New Pride for each share of Pride common stock they currently
own.

     The combined company will be owned approximately 56% by Pride shareholders
and 44% by Marine shareholders. The board of directors of the combined company
will consist of four members of Pride's board and four members of Marine's
board. The chief executive officer of the combined company will be Paul A.
Bragg, Pride's chief executive officer. The chairman of the board of directors
of the combined company will be Robert L. Barbanell, Marine's chairman of the
board.

     The transaction cannot be completed without the approval of the merger
agreement by Pride's shareholders and Marine's shareholders. We have scheduled
separate meetings to be held on      , 2001 for our respective shareholders to
vote on these proposals. The times and places of these meetings are set forth in
the attached notices.

     THE PRIDE AND MARINE BOARDS OF DIRECTORS EACH RECOMMENDS THAT ITS
SHAREHOLDERS VOTE "FOR" THE MERGERS.

     This document provides you with detailed information about the transaction
and the shareholder meetings. You can also obtain financial and other
information about Pride and Marine from documents filed with the Securities and
Exchange Commission. We encourage you to carefully read this entire document and
the documents incorporated by reference before voting, PARTICULARLY THE RISK

                    QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS ABOUT THE MERGERS

Q.   WHY ARE PRIDE AND MARINE PROPOSING THE MERGERS?

A.   The boards of directors of Pride and Marine believe that the combined
     company, as a larger entity with a substantially larger equity market
     capitalization and a strong balance sheet, will command a higher valuation
     in the stock market and be a stronger competitor than either company would
     be on a stand-alone basis.

Q.   PLEASE DESCRIBE THE PROPOSED MERGERS.

A.   Two mutually dependent mergers are proposed. The first merger, which we
     refer to as the "Marine merger," merges Marine into a subsidiary of Pride,
     and converts Marine shares into Pride shares. The second merger, which we
     refer to as the "reincorporation merger" and which will occur immediately
     after the Marine merger, changes the state of incorporation of the combined
     company from Louisiana to Delaware, and converts Pride (Louisiana) shares
     into New Pride (Delaware) shares. Taken together, the mergers result in a
     tax-free exchange of Marine and Pride shares for shares in New Pride on a
     one-for-one basis.

     The surviving company will be named Pride International, Inc. and the pro
     forma ownership will be approximately 56% former shareholders of Pride and
     44% former shareholders of Marine.

Q.   WHAT WILL I RECEIVE AS A RESULT OF THE MERGERS?

A.   Pride and Marine shareholders will each receive one share of New Pride
     common stock for each share of Pride or Marine common stock they own at the
     time of the mergers. The New Pride common stock will be listed on the New
     York Stock Exchange under Pride's existing symbol "PDE."

Q.   WHEN DO YOU EXPECT THE MERGERS TO BE COMPLETED?

A.   We expect to complete the mergers as soon as possible following receipt of
     shareholder and regulatory approvals.

Q.   WHAT DO I NEED TO DO TO VOTE?

A.   Both companies' shareholder meetings will take place on        , 2001.
     After carefully reading and considering the information contained in this
     joint proxy statement/prospectus and the documents incorporated by
     reference, please indicate on the enclosed proxy card how you want to vote.
     Mail your signed proxy card in the enclosed return envelope as soon as
     possible, so that your shares may be represented at your shareholder
     meeting.

Q.   WHAT VOTE DOES MY BOARD OF DIRECTORS RECOMMEND?

A.   The Pride board of directors unanimously recommends that Pride's
     shareholders vote in favor of approval of the merger agreement.

     The Marine board of directors unanimously recommends that Marine's
     shareholders vote in favor of approval of the merger agreement.

Q.   WHAT SHOULD I DO IF I WANT TO CHANGE MY VOTE?

A.   You can change your vote at any time before your proxy card is voted at
     your shareholder meeting. You can do this in one of three ways:

     - you can send a written notice stating that you would like to revoke your
       proxy;

     - you can complete and submit a later dated proxy card; or,

     - you can attend your meeting and vote in person.

     However, your attendance alone will not revoke your proxy. If you have
     instructed a broker to vote your shares, you must follow the procedure
     provided by your broker to change those instructions.

Q.   WHAT IF I PLAN TO ATTEND THE SHAREHOLDER MEETING IN PERSON?

A.   To ensure that your vote is counted, we recommend that you send in your
     proxy anyway. You may still attend the meeting and vote in person.

Q.   IF MY SHARES ARE HELD IN "STREET NAME" BY MY BROKER, WILL MY BROKER VOTE MY
     SHARES FOR ME WITHOUT MY INSTRUCTIONS?

A.   We recommend that you contact your broker. Your broker can give you
     directions on how to instruct the broker to vote your shares. Your broker
     may not vote your shares unless the broker receives appropriate
     instructions from you.

Q.   SHOULD I SEND IN MY STOCK CERTIFICATES?

A.   No. Please do not send in any Marine or Pride stock certificates until you
     receive written instructions after the mergers are completed.

Q.   DOES NEW PRIDE INTEND TO PAY DIVIDENDS ON ITS COMMON STOCK?

A.   No. New Pride does not currently intend to pay dividends on its common
     stock. Neither Pride nor Marine currently pays dividends on its common
     stock.

Q.   WHO CAN HELP ANSWER MY QUESTIONS?

AM MERGER, INC.
5847 San Felipe, Suite 3300
Houston, Texas 77057
Phone: (713) 789-1400

     AM Merger, Inc. is a Delaware corporation and wholly owned subsidiary of
Pride recently formed for the purpose of effecting the Marine merger.

PM MERGER, INC.
5847 San Felipe, Suite 3300
Houston, Texas 77057
Phone: (713) 789-1400

     PM Merger, Inc. is a Delaware corporation and wholly owned subsidiary of
Pride recently formed for the purpose of effecting the reincorporation merger.
At the effective time of the reincorporation merger, PM Merger, Inc. will be
renamed Pride International, Inc. We refer to PM Merger, Inc., which will be the
surviving corporation of the reincorporation merger, as "New Pride."

THE STRUCTURE OF THE MERGERS

     Two mutually dependent mergers are proposed. The first merger is a merger
of Marine into AM Merger, Inc., a newly formed subsidiary of Pride, with the
surviving corporation to be renamed Pride Marine, Inc. This Marine merger will
cause Marine to become a subsidiary of Pride and Marine common stock to be
converted into Pride common stock. The second merger is a merger of Pride into
New Pride, with New Pride as the surviving corporation. This reincorporation
merger will have the effect of changing the state of incorporation of the
combined company from Louisiana to Delaware, and converting Pride (Louisiana)
common stock, including common stock issued to former Marine shareholders, into
New Pride (Delaware) common stock. Taken together, the mergers result in a
tax-free exchange of Marine and Pride common stock for common stock in New Pride
on a one-for-one basis.

  Termination of the Merger Agreement (page 56)

     The merger agreement may be terminated by the mutual written consent of
Marine and Pride. In addition, either Marine or Pride may terminate the merger
agreement if:

     - the mergers have not been completed by December 31, 2001;

     - Pride's shareholders fail to approve the merger agreement;

     - Marine's shareholders fail to approve the merger agreement; or
     - a court or governmental order, decree, ruling or other action permanently
       prohibits the mergers and such an order, decree, ruling or other action
       shall have become final and nonappealable.

     The merger agreement may also be terminated by Pride if:

     - Marine breaches any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement that
       would give rise to a failure of a condition to the mergers and the breach
       is not curable or is not cured within 30 days after receipt of a notice
       of the breach;

     - Marine's board (1) withdraws or materially modifies its approval or
       recommendation of the mergers or (2) recommends a competing acquisition
       proposal for Marine; or

     - subject to various conditions, including giving prior written notice to
       Marine and the payment of a $50 million termination fee, Pride executes
       an agreement regarding an alternative transaction after the Pride board
       determines that it is inconsistent with its fiduciary duties to proceed
       with the mergers in the face of a superior alternative acquisition
       proposal.

     The merger agreement may also be terminated by Marine if:

     - Pride breaches any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement that
       would give rise to a failure of a condition to the mergers and the breach
       is not curable or is not cured within 30 days after receipt of a notice
       of the breach;

     - Pride's board (1) withdraws or materially modifies its approval or
       recommendation of the mergers or (2) recommends a competing acquisition
       proposal for Pride; or

     - subject to various conditions, including giving prior written notice to
       Pride and the payment of a $50 million termination fee, Marine executes
       an agreement regarding an alternative transaction after the Marine board
       determines that it would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties to
       proceed

       with the mergers in the face of a superior alternative acquisition
       proposal.

  Termination Fees and Expense Reimbursement (page 58)

     The merger agreement requires Pride to pay Marine a $50 million fee if:

     - the merger agreement is terminated because Pride's shareholders do not
       approve the merger agreement after the public announcement of a competing
       acquisition proposal for Pride;

     - the merger agreement is terminated by Marine because Pride's board
       withdraws or materially modifies its approval or recommendation of the
       mergers; or

     - the merger agreement is terminated by Pride in order to permit Pride to
       enter into an agreement concerning a superior alternative acquisition
       proposal.

     The merger agreement requires Marine to pay Pride a $50 million fee if:

     - the merger agreement is terminated because Marine's shareholders do not
       approve the merger agreement after the public announcement of a competing
       acquisition proposal for Marine;

     - the merger agreement is terminated by Pride because Marine's board
       withdraws or materially modifies its approval or recommendation of the
       mergers; or

     - the merger agreement is terminated by Marine in order to enter into an
       agreement concerning a superior alternative acquisition proposal.

     The merger agreement requires Pride to pay Marine a fee of $5 million to
reimburse Marine for its costs and expenses if the merger agreement is
terminated because Pride's shareholders do not approve the merger agreement in
circumstances in which the $50 million fee is not payable.

     The merger agreement requires Marine to pay Pride a fee of $5 million to
reimburse Pride for its costs and expenses if the merger agreement is terminated
because Marine's shareholders do not approve the merger agreement in
circumstances in which the $50 million fee is not payable.

  "No Solicitation" Provisions (page 53)

     The merger agreement contains provisions prohibiting either party from
seeking an alternative transaction. These "no solicitation" provisions prohibit
either party from taking any action to solicit a competing acquisition proposal
as described on pages 53 through 54. The merger agreement does not, however,
prohibit either party or its board of directors from considering, and
potentially recommending, an unsolicited written superior proposal from a third
party.

RECIPROCAL STOCK OPTION AGREEMENTS (PAGE 59)

     Each of Pride and Marine has granted the other company an option to
purchase up to 19.9% of its outstanding shares. An option becomes exercisable if
the grantee becomes entitled to receive the $50 million termination fee payable
by the grantor of the option under the merger agreement. The grantee's profit
under each stock option, together with the amount of any termination fee, is
capped at $50 million.

REGULATORY MATTERS (PAGE 46)

     Pride and Marine made appropriate filings in June 2001 under the U.S.
Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act. Certain other countries in which
Pride and Marine have operations may also review the mergers under their
antitrust laws. It is anticipated that all required regulatory clearances will
have been obtained prior to the special meetings of Pride's and Marine's
shareholders; however, such clearances do not have the effect of conferring
immunity against legal or regulatory challenges against the mergers.

ACCOUNTING TREATMENT AND CONSIDERATIONS (PAGE 43)

     The mergers are intended to qualify as a pooling of interests for
accounting and financial reporting purposes. Under this method of accounting,
the assets and liabilities of Pride and Marine will be carried forward to the
balance sheet of the combined company at their recorded carrying amounts,
results of operations of the combined company will include income of Pride and
Marine for the entire fiscal period in which the combination occurs, and
historical results of operations of

the separate companies for fiscal years prior to the mergers will be combined
and reported as the results of operations of the combined company.

CERTAIN UNITED STATES FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSEQUENCES (PAGE 44)

  Pride's Shareholders

     We expect that the Pride shareholders' exchange of Pride common stock for
shares of New Pride generally will not cause Pride shareholders to recognize any
gain or loss for U.S. federal income tax purposes.

  Marine's Shareholders

     We expect that the Marine shareholders' exchange of Marine shares for Pride
shares and the subsequent exchange of Pride shares for shares of New Pride
generally will not cause Marine shareholders to recognize any gain or loss for
U.S. federal income tax purposes.

     THIS TAX TREATMENT MAY NOT APPLY TO SOME SHAREHOLDERS. DETERMINING THE
ACTUAL TAX CONSEQUENCES OF THE MERGERS FOR A SHAREHOLDER MAY BE COMPLICATED. THE
CONSEQUENCES WILL DEPEND ON EACH SHAREHOLDER'S SPECIFIC SITUATION AND ON
VARIABLES NOT WITHIN THE CONTROL OF PRIDE, MARINE OR NEW PRIDE. EACH SHAREHOLDER
SHOULD CONSULT A TAX ADVISOR AS TO THE TAX CONSEQUENCES OF THE MERGERS,
INCLUDING ANY ESTATE, GIFT, STATE, LOCAL OR NON-U.S. TAX CONSEQUENCES OF THE
MERGERS.

NO APPRAISAL RIGHTS

     Under applicable law, none of the shareholders of Pride or Marine has any
right to an appraisal of the value of their shares in connection with the
mergers.

LISTING OF NEW PRIDE SHARES (PAGE 47)

     An application has been filed to list the shares of New Pride common stock
on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol "PDE."

COMPARISON OF RIGHTS OF SHAREHOLDERS (PAGE 75)

     The rights of Marine common shareholders currently are governed by the
Texas Business Corporation Act and Marine's articles of incorporation and
bylaws. The rights of Pride common shareholders currently are governed by the
Louisiana Business Corporation Law and Pride's articles of incorporation and
bylaws. The rights of New Pride's common stockholders will be governed by the
Delaware General Corporation Law and by New Pride's certificate of incorporation
and bylaws, which are attached hereto as Annexes D and E. See pages 75 through
90 for more specific information.

MARKET PRICE AND DIVIDEND INFORMATION (PAGE 62)

     Pride common stock and Marine common stock are both traded on the New York
Stock Exchange. On May 23, 2001, the last trading day before Pride and Marine
announced the mergers, Pride common stock closed at $32.65 per share and Marine
common stock closed at $27.72 per share. On                , 2001, the most
recent practicable date before the date of this document, Pride common stock
closed at $     .  per share and Marine common stock closed at $     .  per
share. The market price of both stocks will fluctuate before the mergers, but
the exchange ratio is fixed. You should obtain current share price quotations
for Pride common stock and Marine common stock.

     Neither Pride nor Marine has paid any cash dividends on its common stock
since becoming a publicly held corporation. New Pride does not initially intend
to pay dividends on its common stock. In addition, the ability of New Pride to
pay cash dividends in the future will be restricted by the covenants related to
debt that it will assume from Pride. The desirability of paying such future
dividends could also be materially affected by U.S. and foreign tax
considerations.

              UNAUDITED PRO FORMA COMBINED SUMMARY FINANCIAL DATA

     The following table sets forth unaudited pro forma combined summary
financial data which are presented to give effect to the mergers under the
pooling of interests method of accounting. The income statement data for the
three-month period ended March 31, 2001 and for each of the years in the three-
year period ended December 31, 2000 have been prepared assuming that the mergers
were consummated on January 1, 1998. The balance sheet data assume that the
mergers were consummated on March 31, 2001.

     The unaudited pro forma combined summary financial data do not purport to
represent what the financial position or results of operations of New Pride
actually would have been had the mergers occurred on the dates indicated or to
project New Pride's financial position or results of operations for any future
date or period. Furthermore, the unaudited pro forma combined summary financial
data do not reflect any cost savings or other synergies which may result from
the mergers or any other changes which may occur as the result of
post-combination activities and other matters. In addition, the unaudited pro
forma combined summary statements of operations data exclude estimates of
non-recurring charges directly attributable to the mergers that will be charged
to operations in the quarter in which the mergers are actually consummated.

     The unaudited pro forma combined summary financial data should be read in
conjunction with the historical consolidated financial statements of Pride and
Marine, including the notes thereto, incorporated by reference in this joint
proxy statement/prospectus and the unaudited condensed pro forma combined
financial statements, including the notes thereto, contained elsewhere herein.

     The following table sets forth selected historical per share data for Pride
and Marine and selected unaudited pro forma combined per share data after giving
effect to the proposed mergers under the pooling of interests method of
accounting. The pro forma combined earnings per share data have been prepared
assuming that the mergers were consummated on January 1, 1998. The pro forma
combined book value per share data assume that the mergers were consummated on
the last day of each period presented. The information presented in the table is
derived from and should be read in conjunction with the unaudited condensed pro
forma combined financial statements, including the notes thereto, included in
this joint proxy statement/prospectus, and the separate audited and unaudited
financial statements of Pride and Marine, including the notes thereto,
incorporated by reference herein.

     Pro forma amounts are not necessarily indicative of results of operations
or financial position that would have resulted had the mergers been consummated
on the dates indicated and should not be construed as being indicative of future
performance.

                                  RISK FACTORS

     In addition to the other information contained in this joint proxy
statement/prospectus and the documents incorporated by reference, you should
carefully consider the following risk factors before you decide how to vote on
the proposed mergers.

RISKS RELATING TO THE MERGERS

  We may not achieve the expected benefits of the mergers.

     The mergers are intended to achieve certain specific goals. See "The
Mergers -- Pride's Reasons for the Mergers" and "The Mergers -- Marine's Reasons
for the Mergers." The likelihood of achieving those goals represents the
subjective judgment of Pride's and Marine's managements and boards of directors.
Some of those goals may not be achieved or, if achieved, may not be achieved in
the time frame in which they are expected. Whether New Pride will actually
realize these anticipated benefits depends on future events and circumstances
beyond the control of New Pride, including the following:

     - A decline in economic conditions in general or in New Pride's industry in
       particular could cause New Pride to fail to meet the expectations of
       Pride's and Marine's boards of directors for revenue, earnings and cash
       flow growth.

     - Differing opinions of securities analysts and investors regarding the
       prospects for New Pride's business and its future financial condition
       could prevent New Pride from enjoying the hoped-for increase in its stock
       market valuation multiples relative to the stock market valuation
       multiples of its smaller competitors.

     - Circumstances could prevent New Pride from reducing its total
       indebtedness or improving its net debt position.

     - New Pride may be unable to attain and sustain the anticipated improvement
       in the credit ratings assigned by credit rating agencies with respect to
       New Pride's publicly traded debt, and it may not be able to achieve a
       lower cost of borrowing than Pride.

     - The other risk factors discussed below may prevent the achievement of the
       believed advantages of the mergers.

Because of these and other factors, it is possible that New Pride will not
realize some or all of the benefits of the mergers that formed the basis for the
recommendations of Pride's and Marine's boards of directors that you approve the
merger agreement.

  The value of the New Pride common stock to be received in the mergers will
  fluctuate.

     The merger agreement does not contain any provisions for adjustment of the
exchange ratio and does not provide any right of termination by either party if
there are fluctuations in the market price of either Pride or Marine stock
before the completion of the mergers. Because no adjustment will be made to the
exchange ratio, the value of the consideration to be received by shareholders in
connection with the mergers cannot be determined until the closing and will
depend upon the market price of New Pride common stock upon completion of the
mergers. Variations in the trading prices of Pride and Marine stock may result
from:

     - changes in the business or results of operations of Pride or Marine;

     - the prospects for the post-merger operations of New Pride;

     - the timing of the mergers;

     - general stock market and economic conditions; and

     - other factors beyond the control of Pride or Marine, including those
       described elsewhere in this "Risk Factors" section.

     Shareholders are urged to obtain current market quotations for both Pride
shares and Marine shares.

  The price of New Pride common stock may decline as a result of the mergers.

     Assuming the mergers are completed, the number of issued and freely
tradable shares of New Pride common stock will increase by nearly 80% when
compared to the current number of shares of Pride common stock. If holders of a
significant number of these new shares elect not to retain their shares, the
market price of New Pride's shares may vary sharply or decline for reasons
unrelated to the financial performance of New Pride.

  New Pride may face difficulties in integrating the operations of Pride and
  Marine.

     Before the mergers, Pride and Marine operated separately. New Pride's
management team will not have had experience with running the combined business.
New Pride may not be able to integrate the operations of Pride and Marine
without a loss of employees, customers or suppliers, a loss of revenues, an
increase in operating or other costs or other difficulties. In addition, New
Pride may not be able to realize the operating efficiencies, synergies, cost
savings or other benefits expected from the mergers. Any unexpected costs or
delays incurred in connection with the integration could have an adverse effect
on New Pride's business, results of operations or financial condition.

  New Pride will be subject to anti-takeover provisions.

     Delaware law and New Pride's certificate of incorporation and bylaws
contain provisions that could prevent or delay an acquisition of New Pride by
means of a tender offer, a proxy contest or otherwise. These provisions may also
adversely affect prevailing market prices for New Pride's shares. On the whole,
these provisions are more restrictive than those to which Marine is currently
subject and less restrictive than those to which Pride is currently subject.
These provisions, among other things:

     - provide that the New Pride board may designate the terms of any new
       series of preferred stock;

     - provide that any action required or permitted to be taken by the
       stockholders must be taken at a duly called annual or special meeting of
       stockholders and not by written consent, and that special meetings of the
       stockholders may be called only by the board of directors, the chairman
       of the board or the president;

     - in accordance with Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law,
       limit transactions between New Pride and an "interested stockholder,"
       which is generally defined as a stockholder that, together with its
       affiliates and associates, beneficially, owns 15% or more of New Pride's
       outstanding voting shares.

     As is currently the case with Pride and Marine, New Pride also will have a
stockholder rights plan that will cause substantial dilution to any person or
group that attempts to acquire New Pride without the approval of its board of
directors. See "Description of Capital Stock of New Pride" beginning on page 70
and "Comparison of Rights of Shareholders" beginning on page 75.

  Directors of Marine and Pride have conflicts of interest in recommending that
  you vote in favor of approval of the merger agreement.

     A number of the officers and directors of Marine and Pride have employment
or severance agreements or benefit arrangements that provide them with interests
in the mergers that are different from, or in addition to, your interests as
shareholders. See "The Mergers -- Interests of Certain Persons in the Mergers."
The receipt of compensation, continued employment, or other benefits in the
mergers, including the vesting of stock options and restricted stock, and the
continuation of indemnification arrangements for current directors of Marine and
Pride following completion of the mergers, should be considered in evaluating
these directors' recommendation that you vote in favor of the approval of the
merger agreement.

RISK FACTORS RELATING TO NEW PRIDE'S BUSINESS FOLLOWING THE MERGERS

  New Pride's business will depend on the level of activity in the oil and gas
  industry, which is significantly affected by volatile oil and gas prices.

     The profitability of New Pride's operations will depend upon conditions in
the oil and gas industry and, specifically, the level of exploration and
production expenditures of oil and gas company customers. The oil and gas
industry is cyclical. The demand for contract drilling and related services is
directly influenced by many factors beyond New Pride's control, including:

     - oil and gas prices and expectations about future prices;

     - the cost of producing and delivering oil and gas;

     - government regulations;

     - local and international political and economic conditions;

     - the ability of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC)
       to set and maintain production levels and prices;

     - the level of production by non-OPEC countries; and

     - the policies of various governments regarding exploration and development
       of their oil and gas reserves.

     Depending on the market prices of oil and gas, companies exploring for oil
and gas may cancel or curtail their drilling programs, thereby reducing demand
for drilling services. Such a reduction in demand may erode daily rates and
utilization of our rigs, and adversely affect New Pride's financial results.

     Utilization rates and dayrates are also affected by the total supply of
comparable rigs available for service in the geographic markets in which New
Pride will compete. Short-term improvements in demand in a geographic market may
cause New Pride's competitors to respond by moving competing rigs into the
market, thus intensifying price competition. Significant new rig construction
could also intensify price competition. In the past, there have been prolonged
periods of rig oversupply with correspondingly depressed utilization and
dayrates largely due to earlier, speculative construction of new rigs. Recent
improvements in dayrates and expectations of longer-term, sustained improvements
in utilization rates and dayrates for offshore drilling rigs may cause New
Pride's competitors to construct new rigs which could adversely affect its
business.

  International events may hurt New Pride's operations.

     New Pride will derive a significant portion of its revenues from
international operations. In 2000, on a pro forma basis New Pride would have
derived approximately 47% of its revenues from operations in South America and
approximately 25% of its revenues from operations in other countries outside the
U.S. Operations in these areas are subject to the following risks, among others:

     - foreign currency fluctuations and devaluation;

     - restrictions on currency repatriation;

     - political instability; and

     - war and civil disturbances.

     Pride limits, and New Pride expects to continue to limit, the risks of
currency fluctuation and restrictions on currency repatriation by obtaining
contracts providing for payment in U.S. dollars or freely convertible foreign
currency. To the extent possible, New Pride expects to limit its exposure to
potentially devaluating currencies by matching the acceptance of local
currencies to New Pride's expense requirements in those currencies. Although
Pride has done this in the past, New Pride may not be able to

take these actions in the future, thereby exposing it to foreign currency
fluctuations that could have a material adverse effect upon its results of
operations and financial condition. Although foreign exchange in the countries
where Pride operates is currently carried out on a free-market basis, there is
no assurance that local monetary authorities in these countries will not
implement exchange controls in the future.

     In addition, from time to time, certain of New Pride's foreign subsidiaries
have conducted operations in Libya and Iran and may do so in the future. These
countries are subject to sanctions and embargoes imposed by the U.S. government.
Although these sanctions and embargoes do not prohibit those subsidiaries from
completing existing contracts or from entering into new contracts to provide
drilling services in such countries, they will prohibit New Pride and its
domestic subsidiaries, as well as employees of New Pride's foreign subsidiaries
who are U.S. citizens, from participating in or approving any aspect of the
business activities in those countries. These constraints on the ability to have
U.S. persons, including New Pride's senior management, provide managerial
oversight and supervision may adversely affect the financial or operating
performance of such business activities.

     New Pride's international operations will also be subject to other risks,
including foreign monetary and tax policies, expropriation, nationalization and
nullification or modification of contracts. Additionally, New Pride's ability to
compete in international contract drilling markets may be adversely affected by
foreign governmental regulations that favor or require the awarding of contracts
to local contractors or by regulations requiring foreign contractors to employ
citizens of, or purchase supplies from, a particular jurisdiction. Furthermore,
New Pride's foreign subsidiaries may face governmentally-imposed restrictions
from time to time on their ability to transfer funds to New Pride.

  New Pride's customers may seek to cancel or renegotiate some drilling
  contracts during periods of depressed market conditions or if New Pride
  experiences operational difficulties.

     During depressed market conditions, a customer may no longer need a rig
that is currently under contract or may be able to obtain a comparable rig at a
lower daily rate. As a result, customers may seek to renegotiate the terms of
their existing drilling contracts or avoid their obligations under those
contracts. In addition, New Pride's customers may seek to terminate existing
contracts if New Pride experiences operational problems. The deepwater markets
in which New Pride will operate require the use of floating rigs with
sophisticated positioning, subsea and related systems designed for drilling in
deep water. If this equipment fails to function properly, the rig cannot engage
in drilling operations, and customers may have the right to terminate the
drilling contracts. The likelihood that a customer may seek to terminate a
contract for operational difficulties is increased during periods of market
weakness. The cancellation of a number of drilling contracts could adversely
affect New Pride's results of operations.

  New Pride may be considered highly leveraged; its significant debt levels and
  debt agreement restrictions may limit its flexibility in obtaining additional
  financing and in pursuing other business opportunities.

     As of March 31, 2001, on a pro forma basis New Pride would have had
approximately $1.8 billion in debt and capital lease obligations. This level of
indebtedness will have several important effects on New Pride's future
operations, including:

     - a significant portion of New Pride's cash flow from operations will be
       dedicated to the payment of interest and principal on such debt and will
       not be available for other purposes;

     - covenants contained in Pride's existing debt arrangements will require
       New Pride to meet certain financial tests, which may affect New Pride's
       flexibility in planning for, and reacting to, changes in its business and
       may limit its ability to dispose of assets, withstand current or future
       economic or industry downturns and compete with others in its industry
       for strategic opportunities; and

     - New Pride's ability to obtain additional financing for working capital,
       capital expenditures, acquisitions, general corporate and other purposes
       may be limited.

     Pro forma combined earnings of Pride and Marine were approximately equal to
2.9 times and 1.7 times pro forma combined fixed charges for the three-month
period ended March 31, 2001 and the

year ended December 31, 2000, respectively. New Pride's ability to meet its debt
service obligations and to reduce its total indebtedness will be dependent upon
its future performance, which will be subject to general economic conditions,
industry cycles and financial, business and other factors affecting its
operations, many of which are beyond its control.

  New Pride will be subject to hazards customary in the oilfield service
  industry and to those more specific to marine operations. It may not have
  insurance to cover all these hazards.

     Pride's and Marine's operations are, and New Pride's operations will be,
subject to the many hazards customary in the oilfield services industry.
Contract drilling and well servicing require the use of heavy equipment and
exposure to hazardous conditions, which may subject New Pride to liability
claims by employees, customers and third parties. These hazards can cause
personal injury or loss of life, severe damage to or destruction of property and
equipment, pollution or environmental damage and suspension of operations. New
Pride's offshore fleet will also be subject to hazards inherent in marine
operations, either while on site or during mobilization, such as capsizing,
sinking and damage from severe weather conditions. In certain instances, New
Pride will be required by contract to indemnify customers or others.

     Pride and Marine maintain, and New Pride expects to continue to maintain,
insurance for injuries to their employees and other insurance coverage for
normal business risks, including general liability insurance. Although Pride and
Marine believe their current insurance coverages to be adequate and in
accordance with industry practice against normal risks in their operations,
their insurance may not be sufficient or effective under all circumstances or
against all hazards to which they may be subject. The occurrence of a
significant event against which New Pride is not fully insured, or of a number
of lesser events against which it is insured, but subject to substantial
deductibles, could materially and adversely affect its operations and financial
condition. Moreover, New Pride may not be able to maintain adequate insurance in
the future at rates or on terms that it considers reasonable or acceptable.

  Failure to retain key personnel could hurt New Pride's operations.

     New Pride will require highly skilled personnel to operate and provide
technical services and support for its drilling units. To the extent demand for
drilling services and the size of the worldwide industry fleet increase,
shortages of qualified personnel could arise, creating upward pressure on wages
and difficulty in staffing rigs.

  Governmental regulations and environmental liabilities may adversely affect
  New Pride's operations.

     Many aspects of Pride's and Marine's operations are, and New Pride's are
expected to be, subject to numerous governmental regulations that may relate
directly or indirectly to the contract drilling and well servicing industries,
including those relating to the protection of the environment. Pride and Marine
have spent, and New Pride will spend, material amounts to comply with these
regulations. Laws and regulations protecting the environment have become more
stringent in recent years and may in certain circumstances impose strict
liability, rendering New Pride liable for environmental damage without regard to
negligence or fault on its part. These laws and regulations may expose New Pride
to liability for the conduct of, or conditions caused by, others or for acts
that were in compliance with all applicable laws at the time the acts were
performed. The application of these requirements or the adoption of new
requirements could have a material adverse effect on New Pride. In addition, the
modification of existing laws or regulations or the adoption of new laws or
regulations curtailing exploratory or development drilling for oil and gas could
have a material adverse effect on New Pride's operations by limiting future
contract drilling opportunities.

                              THE SPECIAL MEETINGS

JOINT PROXY STATEMENT/PROSPECTUS

     This joint proxy statement/prospectus is being furnished to you in
connection with the solicitation of proxies by each of Pride's and Marine's
board of directors with respect to the merger agreement.

DATE, TIME AND PLACE OF THE SPECIAL MEETINGS

     The special meetings are scheduled to be held as follows:

FOR MARINE SHAREHOLDERS:               FOR PRIDE SHAREHOLDERS:
          , 2001                       , 2001
9:00 a.m., Houston time                9:00 a.m., Houston time
Houston, Texas                         Houston, Texas

PURPOSE OF THE SPECIAL MEETINGS

     At the special meetings, Pride's and Marine's board of directors will ask
shareholders to consider and vote to approve the merger agreement.

     If the shareholders of Pride and Marine approve the merger agreement, then
at the closing of the merger agreement:

     - each outstanding share of Marine common stock will be converted into one
       share of Pride common stock; and then

     - each outstanding share of Pride common stock will be converted into one
       share of New Pride common stock.

RECORD DATE; VOTING AT THE MEETING; QUORUM

     Pride.  Pride has fixed the close of business on           , 2001 as the
record date for the determination of the Pride shareholders entitled to receive
notice of and to vote at the Pride special meeting. As of the record date, there
were outstanding           shares of Pride common stock. Each outstanding share
is entitled to one vote on the matter to be voted on. The presence, in person or
by proxy, of the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of Pride common
stock is necessary to constitute a quorum at the Pride special meeting.

     Marine.  Marine has fixed the close of business on           , 2001 as the
record date for determination of the Marine shareholders entitled to receive
notice of and vote at the Marine special meeting. As of the record date, there
were outstanding           shares of Marine common stock. Each outstanding share
is entitled to one vote on the matter to be voted on. The presence, in person or
by proxy, of the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of Marine
common stock is necessary to constitute a quorum at the Marine special meeting.

REQUIRED VOTE

     Pride.  The merger agreement, including the issuance of shares of Pride
common stock in the Marine merger, must be approved by the affirmative vote of
the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of Pride common stock
present, in person or by proxy, at the Pride special meeting at which a quorum
is present.

     The directors and executive officers of Pride have indicated that they
intend to vote their shares in favor of the proposal. On the record date,
directors and executive officers of Pride beneficially owned   % of the
outstanding shares of Pride common stock, excluding shares held by funds managed
by First

Reserve Corporation. In addition, two funds managed by First Reserve
Corporation, of which William E. Macaulay, a director of Pride, is Chairman and
Chief Executive Officer, owned 10,747,735 shares of Pride common stock (or
approximately 15% of the outstanding shares) on the record date and have
indicated that they intend to vote their shares in favor of the proposal. Mr.
Macaulay disclaims beneficial ownership of Pride shares held by funds managed by
First Reserve Corporation.

     Marine.  The merger agreement must be approved by the affirmative vote of
the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of Marine common stock.

     As of the record date for the special meeting, Marine's directors and
executive officers beneficially owned approximately           % of the
outstanding shares of Marine common stock and have indicated that they intend to
vote their shares in favor of the proposal.

EFFECT OF ABSTENTIONS AND NON-VOTES

     Pride.  Abstentions from voting will be counted as present in determining
whether the quorum requirement is satisfied, will be included in the voting
tally and will have the same effect as a vote against a proposal. Because of the
nature of the matter to be voted on, and because there are no other matters to
be voted on, there will be no broker non-votes (proxies submitted by brokers
that do not indicate a vote for a proposal because they do not have
discretionary voting authority and have not received instructions as to how to
vote on the proposal).

     Marine.  Abstentions will be counted as present in determining whether the
quorum requirement is satisfied. Because approval of the merger agreement
requires the affirmative vote of the holders of at least a majority of the
shares of Marine common stock outstanding as of the record date, abstentions and
any failures to vote will have the same effect as votes against approval of the
merger agreement.

ACTION TO BE TAKEN UNDER THE PROXY

     The enclosed proxy is solicited on behalf of Pride's and Marine's boards of
directors. All properly executed written proxies delivered pursuant to this
solicitation, and not later revoked, will be voted at the special meetings in
accordance with the instructions given in the proxy. When voting regarding the
proposal, shareholders may vote for or against the proposal or may abstain from
voting. Shareholders should vote their shares on the enclosed proxy card. If no
choice is indicated, proxies that are signed and returned will be voted "FOR"
the approval of the merger agreement, including, in the case of Pride, the
issuance of shares of Pride common stock in the Marine merger. Pride and Marine
do not know of any matters, other than as described in their notices of special
meeting, that are to come before the special meetings. If any other matters are
properly presented at the special meetings for action, the persons named in the
enclosed form of proxy and acting thereunder will have discretion to vote on the
matters in accordance with their best judgment. If any other matters are
properly presented at the special meetings for action, including, among other
things, consideration of a motion to adjourn the meetings to another time and/or
place (including, without limitation, for the purpose of soliciting additional
proxies or allowing additional time for the satisfaction of conditions to the
mergers), the persons named in the enclosed form of proxy and acting thereunder
generally will have discretion to vote on those matters in accordance with their
best judgment. The persons named in the proxies will not, however, use their
discretionary authority to use proxies voting against the mergers to vote in
favor of adjournment or postponement of the special meetings.

     Any holder of Pride or Marine common stock has the right to revoke his or
her proxy at any time prior to the voting thereof at the special meeting by

     - filing a written revocation with the corporate secretary of Pride or
       Marine prior to the voting of the proxy;

     - giving a duly executed proxy bearing a later date; or

     - attending the special meeting and voting in person.

Attendance by a shareholder at one of the special meetings will not, by itself,
revoke his or her proxy.

PROXY SOLICITATION

     Each of Pride and Marine will bear the cost of the solicitation of proxies
from its shareholders. In addition to solicitation by mail, directors, officers
and employees of Pride or Marine may solicit proxies from shareholders by
telephone, facsimile or telegram or in person. Pride and Marine will supply
banks, brokers, dealers and other custodian nominees and fiduciaries with proxy
materials to enable them to send a copy of such material by mail to each
beneficial owner of shares of the Pride or Marine common stock that they hold of
record and will, upon request, reimburse them for their reasonable expenses in
doing so. In addition, Pride and Marine have engaged Georgeson Shareholder

BACKGROUND OF THE MERGERS

     The proposed mergers are the result of arm's length negotiations between
representatives of Pride and Marine. The following is a summary of the
background of these negotiations, which led to the unanimous approval of the
merger agreement by the boards of directors of both Pride and Marine.

     On several occasions prior to 2001, Paul A. Bragg, the president and chief
executive officer of Pride, and Jan Rask, the president and chief executive
officer of Marine, held informal conversations regarding a possible combination
of their two companies. In February 2000, the companies entered into a
confidentiality agreement and exchanged financial data and other relevant
information. Although several meetings were held between the companies' senior
executive officers, at the end of February 2000 Pride concluded that because of
contingencies relating to its deepwater rig construction program, any further
discussions at that time about a possible combination of the two companies would
not be useful.

     Between February 2000 and January 2001, there were no discussions or other
communications at any level about a possible combination of Marine and Pride.

     In January 2001, Mr. Rask approached representatives of Morgan Stanley to
suggest to Pride the possibility of a combination of Pride and Marine. On
February 14, 2001, the Morgan Stanley representatives and Mr. Rask met with
William E. Macaulay, a director of Pride and the chairman and chief executive
officer of First Reserve Corporation, which manages two investment funds that
own approximately 15% of Pride's outstanding common stock. The purpose of the
meeting was to explore whether Pride would be interested in opening discussions
about a potential merger. Following this meeting, Mr. Macaulay provided Mr.
Bragg a summary of what had transpired, including a report on Marine's interest
in revisiting the subject of a possible business combination.

     On March 8, 2001, Morgan Stanley, after advising both parties that it
wished to act only as an intermediary until each side determined that it wanted
to pursue substantive negotiations, made separate presentations to the senior
executive officers of each of Pride and Marine regarding the strategic and
operational advantages of combining the two companies. Following those meetings,
Morgan Stanley was asked to develop a more comprehensive analysis of a possible
combination of Pride and Marine.

     On March 28 and 29, 2001, representatives of Morgan Stanley met with senior
executives of Marine to further elaborate Morgan Stanley's views on the benefits
of the possible business combination and to discuss structure and implementation
of the potential transaction. Following the meeting on March 29, 2001,
representatives of Morgan Stanley met with Messrs. Bragg, Macaulay and Rask, as
well as Robert L. Barbanell, chairman of the board of Marine, to discuss certain
key elements of a possible merger of Marine and Pride.

     On March 30, 2001, Marine's board of directors met to receive a report from
Mr. Rask and other senior executives of Marine concerning the possible
transaction with Pride. At the meeting, management described Morgan Stanley's
views and their own views concerning the possible combination of Marine and
Pride. The recent meetings with Mr. Bragg and Mr. Macaulay were also reported
and discussed. At the conclusion of the meeting, there was a consensus that
management should continue discussions and proceed with due diligence
investigations of Pride.

     On April 2, 2001, Pride and Marine executed a new confidentiality agreement
to facilitate mutual due diligence investigations concerning the possible
business combination.

     On April 6, 2001, at a meeting of Pride's board of directors, Messrs. Bragg
and Macaulay reviewed various financial, strategic and operational
considerations of a business combination of Pride and Marine and discussed an
analytical summary prepared by Morgan Stanley. Following that review and
discussion, Pride's Board authorized Messrs. Bragg and Macaulay to continue
their discussions with Messrs. Rask and Barbanell and further authorized Pride's
senior management to cooperate with Marine's senior management in the conduct of
their respective due diligence investigations.

     Throughout the month of April and in early May 2001, representatives of
Pride and Marine met several times to conduct their respective due diligence
investigations and, in consultation with their respective legal counsel and
independent accountants, to discuss the framework for combination of the two
companies. Representatives of Morgan Stanley also participated in some of these
meetings.

     On April 19, 2001, the management of Marine and Pride each provided a
management presentation to the other and to Morgan Stanley. On April 26, 2001,
Mr. Rask advised Mr. Bragg that Marine intended to retain Morgan Stanley to act
as Marine's financial advisor in any further discussions about a business
combination of Marine with Pride. On April 27, 2001, Mr. Bragg contacted Salomon
Smith Barney about acting as Pride's financial advisor, and thereafter
representatives of Salomon Smith Barney met on several occasions with senior
executive officers of Pride and conducted financial due diligence investigations
of both Pride and Marine. On May 3, 2001, Pride formally engaged Salomon Smith
Barney.

     In a series of meetings in late April and early May 2001 between Messrs.
Bragg and Macaulay on behalf of Pride and Messrs. Barbanell and Rask on behalf
of Marine, the parties reached general agreement on several matters, including
the organization of a new Delaware corporation as the survivor of a business
combination of Marine and Pride, the number of representatives from each of
Marine and Pride that would initially serve on the board of directors of the new
Delaware company and other corporate governance matters, the market focus and
growth strategies for the combined company, and the composition of the new
Delaware company's senior management.

     Beginning in early May 2001 and continuing through May 23, 2001,
representatives of Pride and Marine, including their respective legal counsel,
held meetings to discuss and negotiate the terms of the proposed merger
agreement and related reciprocal stock option agreements. In connection with the
negotiation of the proposed merger agreement, the tax treatment and the
financial accounting treatment of the possible transaction was also discussed.

     On May 1, 2001, a meeting of Marine's board of directors was held in which
certain of Marine's senior executives and its legal counsel participated to
discuss the possible transaction with Pride. Mr. Rask recapped the earlier
stages of his discussions with Pride and Morgan Stanley and his more recent
discussions. A general discussion was also held regarding the business strategy
of Pride. Marine's management reported on the progress of due diligence
investigations of Pride, including physical inspections of certain of Pride's
rigs, and on planned due diligence inquiries that were yet to be completed. At
the conclusion of the meeting there was a consensus that negotiations should
proceed further with respect to, among other things, the exchange ratios for
Pride's and Marine's common stock, the new Delaware company's strategy, the
identity of the new company's eight member board of directors, its corporate
governance features and the composition of the new company's executive
management.

     During the week of May 7, 2001 and continuing through May 14, 2001, Messrs.
Bragg, Macaulay, Barbanell and Rask had several meetings and telephone
conversations, in which representatives of both Morgan Stanley and Salomon Smith
Barney participated, to negotiate mutually acceptable exchange ratios of shares
of the new Delaware company for each Pride share and each Marine share.

     On May 14, 2001, the board of directors of Marine met to receive a
presentation from Morgan Stanley of its analysis of the proposed business
combination with Pride. Also in attendance were certain of Marine's senior
executives and legal counsel for Marine. Following Morgan Stanley's presentation
and a question and answer period, representatives of Morgan Stanley were excused
from the meeting and a

general discussion of various points raised in the presentation was held.
Marine's management also updated the Marine board on the status of due diligence
reviews. Mr. Rask and senior management were then excused from the meeting
following which the outside directors of Marine discussed personnel matters
likely to arise if the proposed transaction were to proceed. Near the conclusion
of the meeting, Mr. Rask and Marine's other senior managers returned and
Marine's board authorized Mr. Barbanell and Mr. Rask to proceed with negotiating
further the terms of a proposed merger, including the exchange ratio for
Marine's shareholders. A board meeting was set for the next day for the purpose
of receiving a report from Messrs. Barbanell and Rask on their further
negotiations.

     On May 15, 2001, Messrs. Barbanell and Rask reported to the Marine board of
directors their recent negotiations with Messrs. Bragg and Macaulay of Pride
since the board meeting of the day before, particularly with respect to the
proposed exchange ratio for the transaction and Marine's desire for the new
company not to have a classified board of directors. At the conclusion of the
meeting, Mr. Rask was authorized to propose an exchange ratio of one share of
the new company's common stock for each share of Marine common stock and each
share of Pride common stock.

     On May 16, 2001, Messrs. Bragg, Macaulay and Barbanell reached agreement to
recommend to their respective boards of directors an exchange ratio of one share
of New Pride common stock for each share of Marine common stock and each share
of Pride common stock.

     On May 17, 2001, Marine's board of directors held a meeting in which
Messrs. Barbanell and Rask reported on their negotiations since the last meeting
of the Marine board. Mr. Barbanell advised the board that the managements of
both Marine and Pride had agreed to recommend to their respective boards
acceptance of a one-for-one exchange ratio for each share of Marine and Pride
with the new company. Mr. Barbanell reported that he had discussed with Mr.
Macaulay a number of issues, including the possibility of accounting for the
transaction as a pooling of interests, provided that a definitive agreement
could be reached and publicly announced by June 30, 2001, after which date it
was believed that transactions would be ineligible for pooling of interests
accounting. With respect to the composition of the new company's board of
directors, Marine's board determined that each director of Marine would nominate
in writing three members from Marine's board, in addition to Mr. Barbanell, to
serve on the board of the combined company, assuming all other aspects of the
merger were satisfactorily resolved. The three Marine directors receiving the
most nominations would then be proposed by Marine for membership on the new
company's eight member board of directors. Mr. Barbanell was authorized to
tabulate and announce the results of the nominations at a later date.

     On May 18, 2001, the board of directors of Pride met to discuss the
proposed form of merger agreement, the mergers and related transactions.
Representatives of Salomon Smith Barney and Pride's legal counsel, together with
members of Pride's senior management, also participated in this meeting. Salomon
Smith Barney made a presentation regarding the financial terms of the proposed
merger. After a period of deliberation, which included a review of the terms of
the merger agreement, the tax and accounting objectives expected to be achieved
and related matters, Pride's board adjourned the meeting until May 21, 2001 in
order to provide directors an opportunity to reflect on the proposed mergers.
Pride's board asked Mr. Bragg to nominate at the May 21 meeting four members of
Pride's board to serve on the board of the combined company.

     On May 21, 2001, Pride's directors reconvened their adjourned May 18
meeting to give further consideration to the proposed mergers and to provide
directors with an opportunity to ask additional questions of Salomon Smith
Barney, legal counsel and senior management. Following this discussion, Salomon
Smith Barney expressed its oral opinion (which was subsequently confirmed in
writing) to the effect that as of that date the proposed exchange ratio (taking
into account both the Marine merger and the reincorporation merger) was fair,
from a financial point of view, to holders of Pride common stock on the date of
the opinion. See "-- Opinion of Salomon Smith Barney Inc." Following receipt of
that oral opinion, Pride's board of directors unanimously approved the merger
agreement and created a merger committee, comprised of Messrs. Bragg and
Macaulay, to take such further action on behalf of the Pride board as may be
necessary to cause the mergers to be consummated. Mr. Bragg proposed the names
of

four members of Pride's board to serve on the board of the combined company,
which proposal was unanimously approved.

     On May 23, 2001, Marine's board of directors held a meeting in which
Marine's senior executives and legal counsel participated. Morgan Stanley
participated in the first part of the meeting. Prior to the meeting, members of
the Marine board received the proposed form of merger agreement and reciprocal
stock options, copies of the presentation materials to which Morgan Stanley
would refer, and other written materials prepared by management and legal
counsel pertaining to the proposed transaction. At the outset of the meeting,
the Marine board received further presentations from Morgan Stanley concerning
the proposed transaction, assuming an exchange ratio of one share of the new
company for each share of the common stock of Marine and Pride. Following the
Morgan Stanley presentation and questions and answers, the Marine board received
the oral opinion of Morgan Stanley, which was subsequently confirmed in writing,
that the consideration to be received by Marine's shareholders in the merger was
fair to Marine's shareholders from a financial point of view. See "-- Opinion of
Morgan Stanley & Co. Incorporated." The board also received a report from
Marine's legal counsel concerning certain features of the proposed merger
documentation. After a further discussion of various aspects of the merger and
considering Morgan Stanley's fairness opinion, the Marine board of directors
voted unanimously to approve the merger agreement in substantially the form
presented and to recommend that Marine shareholders approve the merger
agreement. Marine's board also authorized Marine's management to finalize the
merger agreement and take such other action as management deemed necessary to
accomplish the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement.

     Immediately following the conclusion of the Marine board meeting on May 23,
the merger agreement was finalized and signed by the parties. The following
morning, Pride and Marine issued a joint press release announcing the execution
of the merger agreement.

PRIDE'S REASONS FOR THE MERGERS

  Reasons for the Marine Merger

     Over the past four years, Pride has experienced substantial growth
resulting from the implementation of its strategy to expand its presence in the
higher margin offshore and international drilling markets. Since February 1997,
Pride has completed significant acquisitions and newbuild projects as well as
conversions, upgrades and refurbishments of its rig fleet. Pride now operates a
global fleet of 305 rigs, including two ultra-deepwater drillships, nine
semisubmersible rigs, 19 jack-up rigs, five tender-assisted rigs, three barge
rigs, 21 offshore platform rigs and 246 land-based drilling and workover rigs.
This period of growth has been accompanied by a substantial increase in Pride's
consolidated long-term indebtedness, which amounted to approximately $1.7
billion at March 31, 2001. The cost of servicing this additional indebtedness
has put constraints on Pride's earnings growth and, consequently, at times the
attractiveness of Pride's common stock in the investment community. Looking
ahead, it is believed that Pride's current debt levels in relation to its equity
market capitalization could impair Pride's ability to continue to grow its
business.

     The combination of Pride and Marine presents a unique opportunity for
deleveraging Pride's consolidated balance sheet and, at the same time,
significantly enhances the competitive positions of both Pride and Marine in the
Gulf of Mexico jack-up rig market and elsewhere. In reaching their conclusion to
approve and recommend the Marine Merger, Pride's directors, in consultation with
members of senior management, legal counsel, independent accountants and
representatives of Salomon Smith Barney, considered many factors, including the
following:

     - By virtue of the fact that Marine is essentially debt-free and the
       mergers will involve the issuance of stock for stock, New Pride's total
       indebtedness as a percentage of total capitalization will be
       approximately 54%, as compared to 62% for Pride. It is expected that this
       will result in improved credit ratings for Pride's outstanding publicly
       traded debt and will thereby reduce New Pride's borrowing costs. In this
       connection, both Standard & Poor's and Moody's Investor Services have

       announced that they are reviewing Pride's publicly traded debt securities
       for possible rating upgrades.

     - Following the mergers, New Pride is expected to be in a position to
       reduce long-term indebtedness and further deleverage its consolidated
       balance sheet from cash flow.

     - New Pride will become the second largest operator of jack-up rigs in the
       Gulf of Mexico and the third largest in the world, which is expected to
       substantially improve the combined companies' competitive position. New
       Pride's competitive position in the deepwater market is also expected to
       improve with the addition of Marine's two deepwater semisubmersible rigs
       to Pride's existing deepwater fleet.

     - As a larger company with a substantially larger equity market
       capitalization and stronger balance sheet, New Pride is expected to be a
       more credible and attractive participant in additional industry
       consolidation initiatives than Pride can be on a stand-alone basis.

     - The size of New Pride's equity market capitalization resulting from an
       all-stock transaction is expected to command a higher valuation in the
       stock market than is achievable by Pride alone by providing greater
       liquidity to investors, in addition to reduced debt leverage.

     - The Pride board of directors considered the effect of the combination
       with Marine on cash flow and earnings per share of New Pride as compared
       with Pride on a stand-alone basis.

     - It is expected that cost savings of at least $10-15 million per year will
       be achievable by New Pride through elimination of redundant shore-based
       facilities and duplicative overhead, increased marketing synergies and
       increased purchasing power.

     - The combination with Marine will be tax-free to Pride and its
       shareholders.

     - The combination with Marine is expected to qualify for treatment as a
       pooling of interests under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.

     - Pride's board of directors considered the presentation, advice and
       opinion of Salomon Smith Barney delivered at its meeting held on May 18,
       2001 and May 21, 2001, with the opinion being subsequently confirmed in
       writing on May 23, 2001, to the effect that the exchange ratio (taking
       into account both the Marine merger and the reincorporation merger) is
       fair, from a financial point of view, to the holders of Pride common
       stock on the date of the opinion.

     - Pride's board of directors considered the terms and conditions of the
       merger agreement, including the fixed exchange ratio of New Pride common
       stock for both Pride common stock and Marine common stock, the rights of
       the parties to respond to, evaluate and negotiate competing business
       combination proposals, the circumstances under which the merger agreement
       may be terminated, the size and impact of the termination fees associated
       with any termination, and the terms and conditions of the reciprocal
       stock option agreements and their impact on the accounting treatment of
       possible alternative business combinations.

     - Pride's board of directors considered possible opportunities and
       alternatives that could be available to Pride if the proposed combination
       with Marine were not undertaken, including pursuing other growth
       opportunities and strategies, and the risks, uncertainties and expenses
       of those alternatives.

  Reasons for the Reincorporation Merger

     Pride was originally incorporated in Louisiana in 1988 as a wholly owned
subsidiary of another company to continue its parent's business of providing
workover and maintenance services for oil and gas wells located onshore in the
United States. Pride was subsequently spun off as an independent company with a
relatively small equity market capitalization whose stock, while quoted on
Nasdaq, was not actively traded for several years. In recent years, Pride's
revenues have grown, the nature and geographic scope of its business has
materially changed and its stock, which is now listed on the New York Stock
Exchange, has become more actively traded. As a result, Pride has, from time to
time, given consideration to whether

Delaware would be more suitable than Louisiana as its corporate domicile. The
matter received increased attention during the course of negotiations with
Marine when legal counsel for both sides recommended having a Delaware
corporation as the survivor in a combination of Marine and Pride.

     The reincorporation merger of Pride into New Pride is a requirement for
completing the Marine merger. Pride's directors believe the following are
advantages to having New Pride domiciled in Delaware rather than Louisiana:

     - Delaware has a well-established body of case law construing the Delaware
       General Corporation Law, which provides businesses with a greater measure
       of predictability than exists in any other jurisdiction. The certainty
       afforded by the well-established principles of corporate governance under
       the Delaware General Corporation Law should benefit New Pride and its
       stockholders and increase New Pride's ability to attract and retain
       outstanding directors and officers.

     - The Delaware General Corporation Law is generally acknowledged to be the
       most advanced and flexible corporate statute in the United States.

     - The Delaware Court of Chancery has an established record of handling
       complex corporate issues with a level of experience, speed of decision
       and degree of sophistication and understanding unmatched by any other
       court in the United States. The Delaware Supreme Court is highly regarded
       and currently has among its justices former Vice Chancellors and
       corporate practitioners.

     - The Delaware legislature each year considers and adopts amendments to the
       Delaware General Corporation Law that address the changing needs of
       businesses, including those brought about by changing business and
       information technologies.

     - Franchise taxes and other costs associated with being domiciled in
       Delaware are not materially different than those associated with being
       domiciled in Louisiana.

     Pride's board of directors also considered the following additional matters
relating to the reincorporation merger:

     - In order to address shareholder democracy issues raised by Marine and by
       certain institutional investor groups, New Pride's corporate charter does
       not provide for a classified board with directors serving staggered terms
       of three years each (as Pride's charter now provides pursuant to
       shareholder approval received on May 18, 2001). Instead, all directors of
       New Pride will be elected on an annual basis.

     - The provisions in New Pride's charter and bylaws that may be deemed to
       have anti-takeover effects are generally less restrictive than those
       contained in Pride's charter and bylaws. See "Comparison of Rights of
       Shareholders."

     - All of Pride's employee benefit plans and programs and its long-term
       incentive plan will become plans and programs of New Pride, and
       outstanding options to purchase Pride common stock will automatically
       become options to purchase the same number of shares of New Pride common
       stock.

     - After the reincorporation merger, shares of New Pride's common stock will
       be traded on the New York Stock Exchange under the Pride symbol ("PDE").

     - Pride's rights and obligations under its material contracts with third
       parties, including contracts governing its long-term indebtedness, will
       continue as rights and obligations of New Pride.

     In determining whether the mergers are in the best interests of Pride and
its shareholders, Pride's board of directors considered the factors above as a
whole and did not assign relative weights to those factors. Individual directors
may have weighed each of these factors differently. Moreover, the foregoing
discussion of Pride's reasons for the mergers is not intended to be exhaustive.

RECOMMENDATION OF PRIDE'S BOARD OF DIRECTORS

     Pride's board of directors believes that the mergers are fair to and in the
best interest of Pride's shareholders, and recommends the approval of the merger
agreement.

     In considering their recommendation, you should be aware that some of the
directors of Pride have interests in the mergers that are different from, or are
in addition to, the interests of Pride shareholders. Please see the section
entitled "Interests of Certain Persons in the Mergers" that begins on page 39.

MARINE'S REASONS FOR THE MERGER

     From Marine's perspective, the fundamental reason for the mergers is that
its board of directors believes New Pride offers better prospects for improving
shareholder value than Marine offers on its own. The principal matters
considered by Marine's board of directors in reaching this overall conclusion,
and in unanimously approving and recommending the merger agreement and the
mergers to Marine shareholders, are summarized below:

     - Marine believes that larger companies in its industry enjoy more generous
       stock market valuation multiples than those experienced by smaller
       competitors. The stock market capitalization of New Pride and its
       "float," or the number of shares of its outstanding common stock not held
       by its affiliates, will each be significantly greater than Marine's stock
       market capitalization and float. These factors are expected to produce
       better stock market valuation multiples for New Pride than Marine could
       expect if it remained a separate company.

     - Marine believes that New Pride's senior management and board of directors
       will be committed to further reducing New Pride's net debt position
       following the mergers, and believes that New Pride's management will take
       reasonable steps to do so. In this regard, the Marine board considers it
       important that the addition of Marine's essentially debt-free assets to
       Pride's assets will contribute substantial free cash flow to New Pride's
       operations that in turn will enable New Pride to further improve its net
       debt position.

     - The combination of Marine's and Pride's rig fleets should strengthen New
       Pride's ability to compete for business in the Gulf of Mexico jack-up rig
       market and in the deepwater semisubmersible rig market, both of which
       Marine believes offer significant opportunities for revenue growth.

     - Marine expects that the merger will be accretive, assuming a continuation
       of recent industry trends, to earnings per share and cash flow per share
       for Marine shareholders in 2002 and 2003.

     - Marine believes that Pride is poised to enjoy the benefits of substantial
       operating leverage in its business. Pride has recently made substantial
       capital expenditures to add four additional semisubmersible rigs to its
       fleet. Assuming the timely deployment of these rigs under market rate
       contracts, Marine believes these assets should contribute substantially
       to New Pride's operating performance in the near term. Additionally,
       Pride's existing South American land rig and E&P services operations are
       well-established and are positioned to contribute significantly more to
       New Pride's earnings and cash flow if market conditions improve further
       in that region.

     The Marine board also considered the following information and factors in
reaching its determination to approve the merger agreement and the mergers, to
conclude that the mergers are fair to and in the best interests of Marine
shareholders, and to recommend that shareholders approve the merger agreement:

     - The analyses and presentation on the financial aspects of the proposed
       merger by and the oral opinion of Morgan Stanley delivered on May 23,
       2001, and subsequently confirmed in writing, to the Marine Board that, as
       of such date and based upon and subject to the matters stated in the
       opinion, the consideration to be received in the mergers by the holders
       of Marine common stock was fair from a financial point of view to such
       holders. See "-- Opinion of Morgan Stanley & Co. Incorporated."

     - The mergers are expected to be tax-free to Marine shareholders.

     - The exchange ratios being used in the mergers and the resulting
       continuing 44% ownership interest in New Pride by Marine's shareholders.

     - The fact that the board of directors of the combined company after the
       transaction will consist of eight directors, four of whom have been
       designated by Marine.

     - Presentations by members of Marine's senior management regarding the
       strategic advantages of combining with Pride, operational aspects of the
       transaction, and the results of management's operational and legal due
       diligence review.

     - Historical information concerning Marine's and Pride's respective
       businesses, financial performance and condition, operations, management,
       competitive position and stock performance.

     - Marine management's view as to the financial condition, results of
       operations and businesses of Marine and Pride before and after giving
       effect to the mergers based on management's due diligence and publicly
       available earnings estimates.

     - The strategic fit of Marine and Pride, including the belief that the
       mergers have the potential to enhance shareholder value through the
       numerous growth opportunities and synergies resulting from combining the
       two companies' complementary strengths and assets, including
       consolidation savings, financial and operating leverage, and operating
       efficiencies.

     - The terms and conditions of the merger agreement and reciprocal stock
       option agreements, including the fact that the exchange ratios are fixed,
       the limitations on the interim business operations of each of Marine and
       Pride, the conditions to consummation of the merger, the rights of the
       parties to the merger agreement under certain circumstances to respond
       to, evaluate and negotiate with respect to other business combination
       proposals, the circumstances under which the merger agreement could be
       terminated and the size and impact of the termination fees associated
       with a termination; the grant of reciprocal options to purchase shares of
       common stock by each company, as well as the advice of Marine's financial
       and legal advisors that these provisions were reasonable in the context
       of the transaction and the impact of the reciprocal stock option
       agreements on the accounting treatment of possible alternative business
       combinations.

     - The interests of the officers and directors of Marine in the mergers,
       including the matters described under "-- Interests of Certain Marine
       Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger," and the impact of the
       mergers on Marine's shareholders and employees.

     - The expected treatment of the mergers as a pooling of interests
       transaction for financial accounting purposes.

     - The benefits of having New Pride domiciled in Delaware as described under
       "-- Pride's Reasons for the Mergers."

     The foregoing discussion of the factors considered by the Marine board is
not intended to be exhaustive, but includes the material factors considered. The
Marine board did not assign relative weights or rank to the factors described
above. In considering the factors described above, individual members of the
Marine board may have given different weights to different factors. The Marine
board considered all of these factors as a whole, and overall considered them to
be favorable to and to support its determination and recommendation.

RECOMMENDATION OF MARINE'S BOARD OF DIRECTORS

     At a special meeting held on May 23, 2001, the Marine board unanimously
resolved that the merger agreement and the merger were advisable and in the best
interests of Marine and its shareholders. At this meeting, the Marine board also
approved the merger agreement and the transactions contemplated by the

merger agreement. Accordingly, the Marine board unanimously recommends that
Marine's shareholders approve the merger agreement.

     In considering their recommendation, you should be aware that some of the
officers and directors of Marine have interests in the mergers that are
different from, or are in addition to, the interests of Marine shareholders.
Please see the section entitled "Interests of Certain Persons in the Mergers"
that begins on page 39.

OPINION OF SALOMON SMITH BARNEY INC.

     Salomon Smith Barney was retained to act as financial advisor to Pride in
connection with the proposed mergers. Pursuant to Salomon Smith Barney's
engagement letter with Pride dated May 3, 2001, Salomon Smith Barney rendered an
oral opinion to the Pride board of directors on May 21, 2001, subsequently
confirmed in writing on May 23, 2001, to the effect that, based upon and subject
to the considerations and limitations set forth in the opinion, its work
described below and other factors it deemed relevant, as of that date, the
exchange ratio (taking into account both the Marine merger and the
reincorporation merger) was fair, from a financial point of view, to holders of
Pride common stock on the date of the opinion.

     The full text of Salomon Smith Barney's written opinion dated May 23, 2001,
which sets forth the assumptions made, general procedures followed, matters
considered and limits on the review undertaken, is included as Annex B to this
document. The summary of Salomon Smith Barney's opinion set forth below is
qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the opinion. PRIDE
SHAREHOLDERS ARE URGED TO READ SALOMON SMITH BARNEY'S OPINION CAREFULLY AND IN
ITS ENTIRETY.

     In arriving at its opinion, Salomon Smith Barney reviewed a draft of the
merger agreement dated May 23, 2001, and held discussions with certain senior
officers and other representatives and advisors of each of Pride and Marine
concerning the business, operations and prospects of Pride and Marine. Salomon
Smith Barney examined certain publicly available business and financial
information relating to Pride and Marine as well as certain financial forecasts
and other information and data for Pride and Marine which were provided to or
otherwise discussed with Salomon Smith Barney by the managements of Pride and
Marine, including information relating to certain strategic implications and
operational benefits anticipated to result from the mergers. Salomon Smith
Barney reviewed the financial terms of the mergers as set forth in the merger
agreement in relation to, among other things, current and historical market
prices and trading volumes of Pride common stock and Marine common stock; the
historical and projected earnings and other operating data of Pride and Marine;
and the historical and projected capitalization and financial condition of Pride
and Marine. Salomon Smith Barney considered, to the extent publicly available,
the financial terms of certain other similar transactions recently effected that
Salomon Smith Barney considered relevant in evaluating the exchange ratio and
analyzed certain financial, stock market and other publicly available
information relating to the businesses of other companies whose operations
Salomon Smith Barney considered relevant in evaluating those of Pride and
Marine. Salomon Smith Barney also evaluated the pro forma financial impact of
the mergers on New Pride. In addition to the foregoing, Salomon Smith Barney
conducted such other analyses and examinations and considered such other
information and financial, economic and market criteria as Salomon Smith Barney
deemed appropriate in arriving at its opinion.

     In rendering its opinion, Salomon Smith Barney assumed and relied, without
independent verification, upon the accuracy and completeness of all financial
and other information and data publicly available or furnished to or otherwise
reviewed by or discussed with it and further relied upon the assumption that the
managements of Pride and Marine were not aware of any facts that would make any
of such information inaccurate or misleading. With respect to financial
forecasts and other information and data provided to or otherwise reviewed by or
discussed with it, Salomon Smith Barney assumed that the managements of Pride
and Marine believed that such forecasts and other information and data had been
reasonably prepared on bases reflecting the best currently available estimates
and judgments of the managements of Pride and Marine as to the future financial
performance of Pride and Marine and the strategic implications

and operational benefits anticipated to result from the mergers. Salomon Smith
Barney expressed no view with respect to such forecasts and other information
and data or the assumptions on which they were based. Salomon Smith Barney
assumed, with the consent of Pride, that the mergers will be treated as tax-
free reorganizations for United States federal income tax purposes. Salomon
Smith Barney did not make and was not provided with an independent evaluation or
appraisal of the assets or liabilities (contingent or otherwise) of Pride or
Marine, nor did it make any physical inspection of the properties or assets of
Pride or Marine. Pride advised Salomon Smith Barney, and Salomon Smith Barney
assumed, that the final terms of the merger agreement would not vary materially
from those set forth in the drafts reviewed by it. Salomon Smith Barney further
assumed that the mergers would be consummated in accordance with the terms of
the merger agreement without waiver of any of the conditions precedent to the
mergers contained in the merger agreement.

     Salomon Smith Barney noted that its opinion with respect to the exchange
ratio, related to the relative values of Pride and Marine and took into account
both the Marine merger and the reincorporation merger. Salomon Smith Barney did
not express any opinion as to what the value of the New Pride common stock
actually will be when issued in the reincorporation merger or the price at which
the New Pride common stock will trade subsequent to the reincorporation merger.
Salomon Smith Barney was not requested to consider, and its opinion did not
address, the relative merits of the mergers as compared to any alternative
business strategies that might exist for Pride or the effect of any other
transaction in which Pride might engage. Salomon Smith Barney further noted that
its opinion related only to the fairness of the exchange ratio to those holders
of Pride common stock as of the date of its opinion. Salomon Smith Barney's
opinion necessarily was based on information available to it and financial,
stock market and other conditions and circumstances existing and disclosed to it
as of the date of its opinion.

     Salomon Smith Barney's advisory services and opinion were provided for the
information of the Pride board of directors in its evaluation of the mergers and
did not constitute a recommendation of the mergers to Pride or a recommendation
to any stockholder as to how such stockholder should vote on any matters
relating to the mergers.

     In connection with rendering its opinion, Salomon Smith Barney made a
presentation to the Pride board of directors on May 18, 2001, which it updated
on May 21, 2001, with respect to the material analyses performed by Salomon
Smith Barney in evaluating the fairness of the exchange ratio to holders of
Pride common stock as of the date of its opinion. The following is a summary of
those presentations. The summary includes information presented in tabular
format. IN ORDER TO UNDERSTAND FULLY THE FINANCIAL ANALYSES USED BY SALOMON
SMITH BARNEY, THESE TABLES MUST BE READ TOGETHER WITH THE TEXT OF EACH SUMMARY.
THE TABLES ALONE DO NOT CONSTITUTE A COMPLETE DESCRIPTION OF THE FINANCIAL
ANALYSES. The following quantitative information, to the extent it is based on
market data, is, except as otherwise indicated, based on market data as it
existed at or prior to May 18, 2001, and is not necessarily indicative of
current or future market conditions.

  Historical Exchange Ratio Analysis

     Salomon Smith Barney derived implied historical exchange ratios by dividing
the closing price per share of Pride common stock by the closing price per share
of Marine common stock for each trading day in the 52-week period ended May 18,
2001. Such derived exchange ratio is referred to below as the historical
exchange ratio, and was used by Salomon Smith Barney as a basis for comparison
with the actual exchange ratio of 1.00x. Salomon Smith Barney calculated that
the implied historical exchange ratio as of May 18, 2001 was 1.02x. Salomon
Smith Barney also calculated the high, low and average implied historical
exchange ratios for certain calendar periods ended May 18, 2001, and based on
these calculations, Salomon Smith Barney derived the implied premium or discount
of the actual exchange ratio

as compared to the average implied historical exchange ratios and the implied
historical exchange ratio as of May 18, 2001. The following table sets forth the
results of this analysis.

                                                      IMPLIED EXCHANGE RATIO         IMPLIED

  Comparable Companies Analysis

     Salomon Smith Barney compared financial, operating and stock market
information for each of Pride and Marine, with the same information for selected
publicly traded offshore and land drilling companies. The selected comparable
companies considered by Salomon Smith Barney were:

     - Transocean Sedco Forex Inc.;

     - Noble Drilling Corporation;

     - Global Marine Inc.;

     - Diamond Offshore Drilling, Inc.;

     - ENSCO International Incorporated;

     - Santa Fe International Corporation;

     - Rowan Companies, Inc.; and

     - Nabors Industries, Inc.

     The forecasted financial information used by Salomon Smith Barney in the
course of this analysis was based on equity research reports published by
Salomon Smith Barney analysts. With respect to Marine and the comparable
companies, calculations were made based on the closing price per share of each
company's common stock as of May 18, 2001. With respect to Pride, Salomon Smith
Barney performed two separate calculations -- one based on the closing price per
share of Pride common stock as of May 18, 2001 of $30.05, and the other based on
the implied value of a share of Pride common stock in the Marine merger of
$29.34 (derived by multiplying the closing price per share of Marine common
stock by the exchange ratio in the Marine merger of 1.00x).

     For Pride, Marine and each of the selected comparable companies, Salomon
Smith Barney derived and compared, among other things:

     - the ratio of each company's firm value to its estimated earnings before
       interest expense, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) for 2002;
       and

     - the ratio of the closing price per common share of each company on May
       18, 2001 (and, in the case of Pride, the implied value of a Pride common
       share in the Marine merger) to (a) its estimated earnings per share (EPS)
       for 2002, and (b) its estimated cash flow per share (CFPS), which is
       comprised of net income plus depreciation, amortization and deferred
       taxes for 2002.

     Firm value, as used by Salomon Smith Barney in its analysis, means equity
value (fully-diluted common stock outstanding multiplied by the closing share
price on May 18, 2001, less any proceeds from the exercise of options or
conversion of securities), plus debt and minority interests, less cash and
investments in unconsolidated affiliates.

     The following table sets forth the results of these analyses.

                                                                               COMPARABLE COMPANIES

  Financial Contribution Analysis

     Salomon Smith Barney analyzed the financial contribution of Pride and
Marine to the pro forma merged entity with respect to certain market and
financial data, including:

     - estimated EBITDA for 2001 and 2002;

     - estimated peak EBITDA and trough EBITDA;

     - estimated net income for 2001 and 2002; and

     - estimated cash flow for 2001 and 2002.

     Salomon Smith Barney performed this analysis using two separate sets of
financial data for Pride and Marine -- one based on equity research published by
Salomon Smith Barney analysts, and the other based on estimates provided by the
managements of Pride and Marine, respectively. Salomon Smith Barney also
performed a separate analysis assuming that Pride and Marine had comparable
debt-to-total capitalization ratios. Estimated peak EBITDA and trough EBITDA
were based on analysts' estimates reviewed by Pride management regarding each
company's potential financial performance at the forecasted peak and trough of
the business cycle.

     In each case, Salomon Smith Barney derived the exchange ratio implied by
the contribution of Pride and Marine to the pro forma merged entity with respect
to each forecasted financial statistic. The following table sets forth the
results of Salomon Smith Barney's financial contribution analysis.

     Salomon Smith Barney compared these implied exchange ratios to the actual
exchange ratio of 1.00x.

  Net Asset Value Summary

     Salomon Smith Barney calculated and compared the total rig asset value and
the net asset value for each of Pride and Marine. Estimated asset values for
Marine were calculated using financial information contained in equity research
published by Salomon Smith Barney analysts. Estimated asset values for Pride
were calculated using two separate sets of financial information -- one based on
equity research published by Salomon Smith Barney analysts and the other based
on Pride management estimates. Based on these calculations, Salomon Smith Barney
derived the net asset value per share for each of Pride and Marine. Salomon
Smith Barney further derived the implied premium of the closing price per common
share of each company as of May 18, 2001 over the net asset value per share of
such company.

     Based on this analysis, Salomon Smith Barney derived the implied exchange
ratios by dividing each of the net asset values per share derived for Pride by
the net asset value per share derived for Marine. The implied exchange ratio
derived using calculations based on equity research published by Salomon Smith
Barney analysts was 0.797x, and the implied exchange ratio derived using
calculations based on Pride management estimates was 1.604x. Salomon Smith
Barney compared these derived exchange ratios to the actual exchange ratio of
1.00x.

  Pro Forma Impacts Analysis

     Salomon Smith Barney performed an analysis of the pro forma impact of the
mergers on Pride to derive the implied accretion or dilution to Pride's
estimated EPS and CFPS for 2002 assuming that the mergers will be accounted for
as a pooling-of-interests. Based on this implied accretion or dilution, Salomon
Smith Barney derived the trading multiple of EPS and CFPS required to be
achieved in order to maintain the value per share of Pride common stock as of
May 18, 2001, of $30.05. Such a multiple is referred to below as a breakeven
trading multiple. Salomon Smith Barney compared the breakeven multiples to EPS
and CFPS trading multiples for the selected comparable companies based on the
closing price per common share for each of the comparable companies as of May
18, 2001.

     Salomon Smith Barney performed this analysis using two separate sets of
financial data for Pride and Marine -- one based on equity research published by
Salomon Smith Barney analysts, and the other based on estimates provided by the
managements of Pride and Marine, respectively. In each case, Salomon Smith
Barney assumed that pre-tax synergies of $15 million would be realized in the
mergers. The following table sets forth the results of this analysis.

                                                                                    COMPARABLE

     Salomon Smith Barney also considered the pro forma capitalization of the
combined company resulting from the mergers. Using balance sheet data as of
March 31, 2001, Salomon Smith Barney derived the following pro forma percentages
and ratios for the combined entity based on this data and derived similar
percentages and ratios for the comparable companies. Net debt, as used by
Salomon Smith Barney in its analysis, means debt less cash. The following table
sets forth the results of this analysis.

                                                                                    COMPARABLE

     The preceding discussion is a summary of the material financial analyses
furnished by Salomon Smith Barney to the Pride board of directors, but it does
not purport to be a complete description of the analyses performed by Salomon
Smith Barney or of its presentation to the Pride board of directors. The
preparation of financial analyses and fairness opinions is a complex process
involving subjective judgments and is not necessarily susceptible to partial
analysis or summary description. Salomon Smith Barney made no attempt to assign
specific weights to particular analyses or factors considered, but rather made
qualitative judgments as to the significance and relevance of all the analyses
and factors considered and determined to give its fairness opinion as described
above. Accordingly, Salomon Smith Barney believes that its analyses, and the
summary set forth above, must be considered as a whole, and that selecting
portions of the analyses and of the factors considered by Salomon Smith Barney,
without considering all of the analyses and factors, could create a misleading
or incomplete view of the processes underlying the analyses conducted by Salomon
Smith Barney and its opinion. With regard to the comparable companies analysis

summarized above, Salomon Smith Barney selected comparable public companies on
the basis of various factors, including size and similarity of the line of
business; however, no company utilized in these analyses is identical to Pride
or Marine. As a result, these analyses are not purely mathematical, but also
take into account differences in financial and operating characteristics of the
subject companies and other factors that could affect the transaction or public
trading value of the subject companies to which Pride and Marine are being
compared. In its analyses, Salomon Smith Barney made numerous assumptions with
respect to Pride, Marine, industry performance, general business, economic,
market and financial conditions and other matters, many of which are beyond the
control of Pride and Marine. Any estimates contained in Salomon Smith Barney's
analyses are not necessarily indicative of actual values or predictive of future
results or values, which may be significantly more or less favorable than those
suggested by these analyses. Estimates of values of companies do not purport to
be appraisals or necessarily to reflect the prices at which companies may
actually be sold. Because these estimates are inherently subject to uncertainty,
none of Pride, Marine, the Pride board of directors, the Marine board of
directors, Salomon Smith Barney or any other person assumes responsibility if
future results or actual values differ materially from the estimates. Salomon
Smith Barney's analyses were prepared solely as part of Salomon Smith Barney's
analysis of the fairness of the exchange ratio and were provided to the Pride
board of directors in that connection. The opinion of Salomon Smith Barney was
only one of the factors taken into consideration by the Pride board of directors
in making its determination to approve the agreement and the mergers. See
"-- Pride's Reasons for Mergers."

     Salomon Smith Barney is an internationally recognized investment banking
firm engaged in, among other things, the valuation of businesses and their
securities in connection with mergers and acquisitions, restructurings,
leveraged buyouts, negotiated underwritings, competitive biddings, secondary
distributions of listed and unlisted securities, private placements and
valuations for estate, corporate and other purposes. Pride selected Salomon
Smith Barney to act as its financial advisor on the basis of Salomon Smith
Barney's international reputation and Salomon Smith Barney's familiarity with
Pride. Salomon Smith Barney and its predecessors and affiliates have previously
provided and currently are providing investment banking services to Pride and
Marine unrelated to the mergers, for which Salomon Smith Barney has received and
may receive compensation. In the ordinary course of its business, Salomon Smith
Barney and its affiliates may actively trade or hold the securities of Pride and
Marine for its own account and for the account of customers and, accordingly,
may at any time hold a long or short position in those securities. Salomon Smith
Barney and its affiliates (including Citigroup Inc. and its affiliates) may
maintain other relationships with Pride, Marine and their respective affiliates.

     From time to time Salomon Smith Barney has provided financial advisory and
investment banking services to Marine that were unrelated to the mergers.
Salomon Smith Barney received customary fees for rendering of these services.
This engagement was terminated as of May 22, 2001.

     Pursuant to Salomon Smith Barney's engagement letter, Pride agreed to pay
Salomon Smith Barney a fee of up to $7.5 million, all but $1.0 million of which
is contingent upon consummation of the mergers. Pride has also agreed to
reimburse Salomon Smith Barney for its reasonable travel and other out-of-pocket
expenses incurred in connection with its engagement, including the reasonable
fees and expenses of its counsel, and to indemnify Salomon Smith Barney against
specific liabilities and expenses relating to or arising out of its engagement,
including liabilities under the federal securities laws.

OPINION OF MORGAN STANLEY & CO. INCORPORATED

     Marine retained Morgan Stanley to provide it with financial advisory
services and a financial fairness opinion in connection with the merger. Morgan
Stanley was selected to act as Marine's financial advisor based on Morgan
Stanley's qualifications, expertise and reputation and its knowledge of the
business and affairs of Marine. At the meeting of the Marine board of directors
on May 23, 2001, Morgan Stanley rendered its oral opinion, which was confirmed
in writing as of such date, that as of that date, and subject to and based on
the various considerations set forth in its opinion, the merger consideration to
be received by holders of Marine common stock pursuant to the merger agreement
was fair from a financial point of view to the Marine common shareholders.

     THE FULL TEXT OF MORGAN STANLEY'S WRITTEN OPINION, DATED AS OF MAY 23,
2001, WHICH SETS FORTH, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE ASSUMPTIONS MADE, PROCEDURES

TO, AND SHOULD, READ THIS OPINION CAREFULLY AND IN ITS ENTIRETY. MORGAN
STANLEY'S OPINION IS DIRECTED TO THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS OF MARINE, ADDRESSES
ONLY THE FAIRNESS FROM A FINANCIAL POINT OF VIEW TO THE HOLDERS OF MARINE COMMON
STOCK OF THE MERGER CONSIDERATION TO BE RECEIVED BY SUCH SHAREHOLDERS PURSUANT
TO THE MERGER AGREEMENT, AND DOES NOT ADDRESS ANY OTHER ASPECT OF THE MERGER OR
CONSTITUTE A RECOMMENDATION TO ANY MARINE SHAREHOLDER AS TO HOW TO VOTE AT THE
SPECIAL MEETING. THIS SUMMARY IS QUALIFIED IN ITS ENTIRETY BY REFERENCE TO THE
FULL TEXT OF THE OPINION.

     In connection with rendering its opinion, Morgan Stanley, among other
things:

     - reviewed certain publicly available financial statements and other
       information of Marine and Pride;

     - reviewed certain internal financial statements and other financial and
       operating data concerning Marine and Pride prepared by the management of
       Marine and Pride, respectively;

     - analyzed certain financial projections prepared by the management of
       Pride and Marine, respectively;

     - discussed the past and current operations and financial condition and the
       prospects of Marine and Pride, including information relating to certain
       strategic, financial and operational benefits anticipated from the
       mergers, with senior executives of Marine and Pride;

     - reviewed the pro forma impact of the mergers on New Pride's earnings per
       share and cash flow per share;

     - reviewed the reported prices and trading activity for the Marine common
       stock and the Pride common stock;

     - compared the financial performance of Marine and Pride and the prices and
       trading activity of the Marine common stock and the Pride common stock
       with that of certain other comparable publicly-traded companies and their
       securities;

     - reviewed the financial terms, to the extent publicly available, of
       certain comparable merger transactions;

     - participated in discussions and negotiations among representatives of
       Marine and Pride and their financial and legal advisors;

     - reviewed the merger agreement and certain related documents; and

     - performed such other analyses and considered such other factors as they
       deemed appropriate.

     In rendering its opinion, Morgan Stanley assumed and relied upon, without
independent verification, the accuracy and completeness of the information
reviewed by it for the purposes of its opinion. With respect to the financial
projections, including information relating to certain strategic, financial and
operational benefits anticipated from the mergers, Morgan Stanley assumed that
they were reasonably prepared on bases reflecting the best currently available
estimates and judgments of the future financial performance of Marine and Pride.
In addition, Morgan Stanley assumed that the mergers will be consummated in
accordance with the terms set forth in the merger agreement, including, among
other things, that the mergers will be accounted for as a "pooling-of-interests"
business combination in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting
principles and the mergers will be treated as a tax-free reorganization and/or
exchange, each pursuant to the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. Morgan Stanley did
not make any independent valuation or appraisal of the assets or liabilities of
Marine and Pride, nor has it been furnished with any such appraisals. Morgan
Stanley's opinion was necessarily based on financial, economic, market and other
conditions as in effect on, and the information made available to it as of, the
date of its opinion.

     The following is a brief summary of the material financial analyses
performed by Morgan Stanley in connection with its oral opinion and the
preparation of its written opinion dated May 23, 2001. This summary of Morgan
Stanley's financial analyses includes information presented in tabular format.
In order to fully understand the financial analyses performed by Morgan Stanley,
the tables must be read together with the text of each summary. The tables alone
do not constitute a complete description of the financial analyses.

     Comparable Publicly Traded Company Analysis.  As part of its analysis,
Morgan Stanley compared certain financial information of Marine and Pride with
that of a group of publicly traded offshore drilling companies that shared some
characteristics with Marine and Pride. This financial information included price
to forecasted 2001 and 2002 earnings per share ("EPS") multiples, price to
forecasted 2001 and 2002 cash flow per share ("CFPS") multiples, firm value to
forecasted 2001 and 2002 EBITDA multiples, equity value to net asset value
("NAV," defined as the estimated current market value of the assets less debt
and preferred stock plus cash divided by the shares outstanding) and equity
value to replacement value of assets ("RVA," defined as the estimated
replacement value of the assets less debt and preferred stock plus cash divided
by the shares outstanding). This analysis was based on a compilation of publicly
available estimates by securities research analysts. The following table
presents, as of May 22, 2001, the range of multiples for the comparable
companies of each of price to projected 2001 and 2002 EPS, price to projected
2001 and 2002 CFPS, firm value to projected 2001 and 2002 EBITDA, equity value
to NAV and equity value to RVA:

     No company utilized in Morgan Stanley's peer group comparison analysis as a
comparable company is identical to Marine or Pride. Accordingly, an analysis of
the above results necessarily involves complex considerations and judgments
concerning differences in financial and operating characteristics of the
companies and other factors that could affect the public trading value of
companies to which they are being compared. In evaluating the comparable
companies, Morgan Stanley made judgments and assumptions with regard to industry
performance, general business, economic, market and financial conditions and
other matters, many of which are beyond the control of Marine or Pride, as well
as the assumed absence of any material adverse change in the financial condition
and prospects of Marine, Pride or the industry or in the financial markets in
general. Mathematical analysis, such as determining the mean or median, is not,
in itself, a meaningful method of using comparable publicly traded company data.

     Historical Exchange Ratio Analysis.  Morgan Stanley also reviewed the ratio
of the daily closing prices of Pride common stock divided by the corresponding
closing price of Marine common stock over various periods ended May 22, 2001.
Morgan Stanley calculated the average of the historical ratios and computed the
premium represented by the Marine merger consideration, or the common stock
exchange ratio of 1.0 share of Pride common stock for each share of Marine
common stock over the average of the

historical ratios for various periods. The following table presents the range of
historical ratios over the periods covered compared to the exchange ratio in the
Marine merger.

     Summary of Projections -- EPS.  In an effort to assess the impact of this
transaction, Morgan Stanley has reviewed two sets of earnings projections. The
"Street Case" set of projections reflects First Call Estimates, for EPS only,
and Morgan Stanley equity research analyst projections of other financial
metrics for Marine and Pride. The "Conformed Case" set of projections reflects
Marine management projections for Marine and Pride management projections for
Pride, with adjustments based on existing contracts and conformity of spot day
rates and utilization projected by Marine management for similar assets. The
following tables display the EPS and EPS growth used for both the "Conformed
Case" and "Street Case":

     Contribution Analysis.  Morgan Stanley reviewed certain projected operating
and financial information, including, among other things, earnings and operating
cash flow, for Marine, Pride and the pro forma combined entity resulting from
the mergers, without giving effect to any potential synergies that may result
from the transaction and excluding non-recurring integration related costs or
charges. Morgan Stanley also analyzed and reviewed certain estimates of NAVs and
RVAs. The analysis was performed utilizing information for Marine and Pride
based on estimates from the management of Marine and Pride for the fiscal years
ended 2001 through 2003 and based on various scenarios. The contribution
analysis was performed on the basis of a hypothetical transaction in which
Marine would acquire Pride by the issuance of shares of Marine common stock in
exchange for shares of Pride common stock. This analysis therefore should be
read so that the issuance of fewer shares of Marine common stock for each share
of Pride common stock is more favorable to holders of Marine common stock. Based
on this analysis, the range of implied number of shares of Marine common stock
for each share of Pride common stock ranges from 1.07 to 1.20 based on analyst
price target information. The range based on the contribution analysis was 0.75
to 1.53 based on earnings analysis, 1.10 to 1.67 based on operating cash flow
analysis, 1.03 based on net asset value analysis and 1.66 based on replacement
value analysis. These numbers compare to the effective exchange ratio of 1.00
contained in the merger agreement, or the hypothetical issuance of one share of
Marine common stock for each share of Pride common stock.

     Pro Forma Merger Analysis.  Morgan Stanley analyzed the pro forma impact of
the mergers on Marine's projected EPS, and CFPS for the fiscal years ended 2001,
2002 and 2003 and peak earnings results, while giving effect to $15 million of
expected pre-tax synergies based on guidance by Marine and Pride management
starting in 2002 and the impact of a reduction in Marine's effective income tax
rate resulting from the merger. The analysis was performed utilizing both the
"Conformed Case" and "Street Case" estimates as described earlier. Based on
these forecasts, the mergers would be expected to be dilutive to Marine's EPS in
2001 and accretive to EPS in 2002, 2003 and accretive to CFPS in 2001, 2002,
2003.

     In connection with the review of the mergers by the Marine board, Morgan
Stanley performed a variety of financial and comparative analyses for purposes
of providing its opinion given in connection therewith. The preparation of a
fairness opinion is a complex process and is not necessarily susceptible to
partial analysis or summary description. In arriving at its opinion, Morgan
Stanley considered the results of all of its analyses as a whole and did not
attribute any particular weight to any particular analysis or factor considered
by it. Furthermore, Morgan Stanley believes that selecting any portion of its
analyses or factors considered by it, without considering all analyses and
factors as a whole, would create an incomplete view of the process underlying
its opinion. In addition, Morgan Stanley may have given various analyses and
factors more or less weight than other analyses and factors and may have deemed
various assumptions more or less probable than other assumptions, so that the
ranges of valuations resulting from any particular analysis described above
should therefore not be taken to be Morgan Stanley's view of the actual value of
Marine or Pride.

     In performing its analyses, Morgan Stanley made numerous assumptions with
respect to industry performance, general business and economic conditions and
other matters, many of which are beyond the control of Marine or Pride. Any
estimates contained in Morgan Stanley's analysis are not necessarily indicative
of future results or actual values, which may be significantly more or less
favorable than those suggested by such estimates. The analyses were prepared
solely as part of Morgan Stanley's analysis of the fairness from a financial
point of view of the merger consideration to be received by holders of Marine
common stock, pursuant to the merger agreement, and were conducted in connection
with the delivery by Morgan Stanley of its opinion dated May 23, 2001 to the
Marine board of directors. The analyses do not purport to be appraisals or to
reflect the prices at which Marine common stock or Pride common stock actually
may be valued or the prices at which their shares may actually trade in the
marketplace. Accordingly, such analyses and estimates are inherently subject to
substantial uncertainty.

     In addition, as described above, Morgan Stanley's opinion and presentation
to the Marine board of directors was one of many factors taken into
consideration by the Marine board of directors in making its

decision to approve the merger. Consequently, the Morgan Stanley analyses as
described above should not be viewed as determinative of the opinion of the
Marine board of directors with respect to the value of Marine or of whether the
Marine board of directors would have been willing to agree to different merger
considerations. The merger consideration pursuant to the merger agreement and
other terms of the merger agreement were determined through arm's-length
negotiations between Marine and Pride and were approved by the Marine board of
directors.

     Morgan Stanley did not recommend any specific merger consideration to
Marine or that any given merger consideration constituted the only appropriate
merger consideration for Marine in the merger.

     In arriving at its opinion, Morgan Stanley was not authorized to solicit,
and did not solicit, interest from any party with respect to the acquisition of
Marine or any of its assets, nor did it negotiate with any of the parties, other
than Pride, which expressed interest to it in the possible acquisition of or
merger with Marine or certain of its constituent businesses.

     Morgan Stanley is an internationally recognized investment banking and
advisory firm. Morgan Stanley, as part of its investment banking and financial
advisory business, is continuously engaged in the valuation of businesses and
securities in connection with mergers and acquisitions, negotiated underwriting,
competitive biddings, secondary distributions of listed and unlisted securities,
private placements and valuations for corporate and other purposes. In the
ordinary course of Morgan Stanley's trading, brokerage and financing activities,
Morgan Stanley or its affiliates may at any time hold long or short positions,
trade or otherwise effect transactions, for its own account or for the account
of customers, in the equity or debt securities or senior loans of Marine or
Pride.

     Morgan Stanley is providing certain investment banking services to Marine
in connection with this transaction, including providing a fairness opinion to
Marine. Morgan Stanley will receive customary fees for those services. In the
past, Morgan Stanley and its affiliates have provided financial advisory and
financing services for Pride and have received fees for rendering these
services.

     Pursuant to an engagement letter, dated April 23, 2001 between Morgan
Stanley and Marine, Morgan Stanley provided financial advisory services and a
financial opinion in connection with the merger, and Marine agreed to pay Morgan
Stanley a fee of approximately $11.0 million at the time of the closing of the
merger. Marine has also agreed to reimburse Morgan Stanley for its expenses
incurred in performing its services. In addition, Marine has agreed to indemnify
Morgan Stanley and its affiliates, their respective directors, officers, agents
and employees and each person, if any, controlling Morgan Stanley or any of its
affiliates against certain liabilities and expenses, including certain
liabilities under the federal securities laws, related to or arising out of
Morgan Stanley's engagement and any related transactions.

INTERESTS OF CERTAIN PERSONS IN THE MERGERS

  Pride

     In considering the recommendation of the board of directors of Pride to
vote for the proposal to approve the merger agreement, shareholders of Pride
should be aware that members of the Pride board of directors and Pride's
executive officers may have interests in the mergers that differ from, or are in
addition to, those of Pride shareholders generally. The Pride board of directors
was aware of these interests during its deliberations of the merits of the
mergers and in determining to recommend to the shareholders of Pride that they
vote for the proposal to approve the merger agreement.

     Pride Officers and Directors Will Become Officers, Directors and Advisory
Directors of New Pride After the Mergers.  Paul A. Bragg, currently the
president and chief executive officer of Pride, James W. Allen, currently the
senior vice president and chief operating officer of Pride, and Earl W. McNiel,
currently the vice president and chief financial officer of Pride, will serve in
those capacities for New Pride upon completion of the mergers. Messrs. Bragg,
Jorge E. Estrada M., William E. Macaulay and Ralph D. McBride, who currently are
directors of Pride, will become directors of New Pride. Messrs. James B.
Clement, Remi Dorval, Christian J. Boon Falleur and James T. Sneed, who are
currently directors of

Pride, will serve as advisory directors of New Pride for a period of two years
from the time of the mergers and receive annual directors' fees of $30,000 for
such service.

     Pride Directors' Stock Option Plan.  Pride's directors who are not
employees have been granted options to purchase shares of Pride common stock
under Pride's 1993 Directors' Stock Option Plan. Some of these options are not,
at present, fully exercisable by the directors. The Plan provides for the
acceleration of full exercisability of options upon a "change of control" of
Pride, as defined in the plan. As so defined, approval of the mergers by the
board of directors of Pride has resulted in a "change of control."

  Marine

     In considering the recommendation of the board of directors of Marine to
approve the merger agreement, the Marine shareholders should be aware that
members of both the Marine's board of directors and certain members of
management may have interests in the mergers that differ from, or are in
addition to, those of the shareholders generally. The board of directors of
Marine was aware of each of these competing interests in the course of its
evaluation of the proposed mergers and its ultimate recommendation to the
shareholders to approve the merger agreement.

     Jan Rask Employment Agreement.  Jan Rask, who is currently president and
chief executive officer of Marine, will enter into a new two-year employment
agreement with New Pride to serve as managing director for acquisitions and
special products. The agreement will provide for an annual salary equal to his
current salary of $450,000 and guaranteed annual bonuses with respect of 2001 of
140% of base salary (less other amounts paid for 2001 bonus), payable in 2002,
and 100% of base salary for periods thereafter.

     Severance Payments to Marine Executives.  Sixteen Marine officers and key
employees, including Messrs. Rask and O'Keefe, have change of control provisions
in their employment or severance agreements that will be triggered by the
mergers. Under these agreements, a Marine executive will be entitled to receive
a severance payment of one-half to two (three in the case of Mr. Rask) times his
annual salary and bonus if, within specified periods of up to two years after
the mergers, New Pride terminates the executive's employment or the executive
terminates his employment after a material change in the executive's employment
terms (provided the termination by the executive is on or before the 30th day
after the change in employment terms or, in many cases, the date nine months
after the mergers, if later). Six of the agreements (including those with
Messrs. Rask and O'Keefe) also provide for a gross up for any excise taxes under
Section 280G of the Internal Revenue Code. Messrs. Rask and O'Keefe and one
other executive officer have the right to receive these severance payments if
the executive terminates his employment within two years after the mergers for
any reason. The payment to Mr. Rask under this provision would be $2.7 million
(plus a gross up for any excise taxes).

     Marine Options and Restricted Stock.  Pursuant to their existing contracts,
upon completion of the mergers, all outstanding shares of Marine restricted
stock and all options to purchase Marine common stock that are held by officers,
directors and employees of Marine will become fully vested, and all of the stock
options will become fully exercisable.

     Marine Directors Will Become Directors and Advisory Directors of New
Pride.  Under the terms of the merger agreement, Messrs. Robert L. Barbanell,
David A. B. Brown, J. C. Burton, and David B. Robson, who are currently
directors of Marine, will become directors of New Pride. Mr. Barbanell will
serve as chairman of the board of directors of New Pride. Messrs. Howard I. Bull
and Robert C. Thomas, who are currently directors of Marine, will serve as
advisory directors of New Pride for a period of two years from the time of the
mergers and receive annual directors' fees of $30,000 for such service.

  Indemnification and Insurance

     The merger agreement provides that each person who had been an officer or
director of Pride or Marine before the mergers will be indemnified by New Pride
after the mergers to the fullest extent permitted under applicable law. The
rights of these officers and directors will be in addition to any rights

they may have under New Pride's certificate of incorporation and bylaws. The
merger agreement further provides that, for six years after the mergers, New
Pride will maintain directors' and officers' liability insurance policies that
provide coverage to those officers and directors of Pride or Marine covered by
an existing policy that are substantially no less advantageous than the existing
policies. New Pride will not, however, be required to pay annual premiums in
excess of 150% of the last annual premium paid by Pride or Marine before the

CONVERSION OF STOCK OPTIONS AND ASSUMPTION OF STOCK PLANS

     Pursuant to the merger agreement, each option to acquire Marine common
stock and Pride common stock will remain outstanding and be assumed by New
Pride. Each option to acquire Marine common stock and Pride common stock will be
deemed to constitute an option to acquire the same number of shares of New Pride
common stock and will be subject to the same terms and conditions as under the
applicable Marine or Pride stock option plan and option agreement, except that
options to acquire Marine common stock will become fully vested and exercisable
as a result of the mergers, pursuant to the "change of control" provisions of
the Marine stock option plans.

EMPLOYEE BENEFIT MATTERS

     Upon the reincorporation merger, all employees of Marine, Pride and their
subsidiaries will be employed by New Pride or its subsidiaries. New Pride has
agreed not to terminate the employment of ten officers and key employees of
Marine prior to January 1, 2002.

     All Marine and Pride benefit plans in effect at the time of the mergers
will remain in effect, to the extent practicable, until otherwise determined by
New Pride. If any of the benefit plans are not continued, New Pride will for a
period of one year after the mergers maintain benefit plans that are no less
favorable than those provided to such employees immediately prior to the
mergers. However, if it would be unduly burdensome or would materially increase
the cost to New Pride to provide plans which are no less favorable than those
previously provided by Marine or Pride, then New Pride will not be obligated to
continue such benefit plans.

     The matters described in this section are summaries of provisions of the
merger agreement that are subject to waiver or amendment by the parties to the
merger agreement. These provisions are not intended to grant third party
beneficiary rights to any person that is not a party to the merger agreement.

EXCHANGE OF MARINE AND PRIDE COMMON STOCK CERTIFICATES FOR NEW PRIDE COMMON
STOCK CERTIFICATES

     Each share of Marine common stock outstanding immediately before the
effective time of the Marine merger will be converted into one share of Pride
common stock. Immediately after the Marine merger, each outstanding share of
Pride common stock, including the shares issued in the Marine merger, will, as a
result of the reincorporation merger, be converted into one share of common
stock of New Pride. Following the mergers, New Pride's exchange agent, American
Stock Transfer & Trust Company, will mail to each shareholder of Marine and
Pride a letter of transmittal and instructions for the surrender of Marine and
Pride common stock certificates in exchange for New Pride common stock
certificates. When you deliver your certificates of Marine or Pride common stock
to the exchange agent, along with a properly executed letter of transmittal and
any other required documents, you will receive certificates representing, or
statements indicating book-entry ownership of, the number of shares of New Pride
common stock that you are entitled to receive under the merger agreement. The
surrendered certificates will be canceled.

     Neither New Pride nor the exchange agent or any other person will be liable
to any former Marine shareholder for any amount properly delivered to a public
official pursuant to applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar laws.

     YOU SHOULD NOT SUBMIT YOUR STOCK CERTIFICATES UNTIL YOU RECEIVE THE
TRANSMITTAL INSTRUCTIONS AND A FORM OF LETTER OF TRANSMITTAL FROM THE EXCHANGE
AGENT.

DIVIDENDS

     Neither Pride nor Marine has paid any cash dividends on its common stock
since becoming a publicly held corporation. New Pride initially intends to
retain all available earnings for use in its business and does not anticipate
paying dividends on its common stock at any time in the foreseeable future. In
addition, the ability of New Pride to pay cash dividends in the future will be
restricted by the covenants related to debt that it will assume from Pride. The
desirability of paying such dividends could also be materially affected by U.S.
and foreign tax considerations.

ACCOUNTING TREATMENT AND CONSIDERATIONS

     The mergers are intended to qualify as a pooling of interests for
accounting and financial reporting purposes. Under this method of accounting,
the recorded historical carrying amounts of the assets and liabilities of Pride
and Marine will be carried forward to the financial statements of the combined
company at recorded amounts, results of operations of the combined company will
include income of Pride and Marine for the entire fiscal period in which the
combination occurs, and the historical results of operations of the separate
companies for fiscal years prior to the mergers will be combined and reported as
the results of operations of the combined company.

     Pride and Marine each will use commercially reasonable best efforts to
obtain a letter from their respective independent accountants in which their
respective independent accountants concur with the conclusions of management
that no condition exists that would preclude a pooling of interests accounting

treatment. Certain events, including certain transactions with respect to Pride
common stock or Marine common stock by affiliates of Pride or Marine,
respectively, may prevent the mergers from qualifying as a pooling of interests
for accounting and financial reporting purposes. For information concerning
certain restrictions to be imposed on the transferability of New Pride common
stock to be received by affiliates in order, among other things, to ensure the
availability of pooling of interests accounting treatment, see "Federal
Securities Law Consequences; Resale Restrictions."

CERTAIN UNITED STATES FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSEQUENCES

  Scope of Discussion

     The following discussion summarizes the material U.S. federal income tax
consequences of the Marine merger and the reincorporation merger to Marine,
Pride, the Marine shareholders and the Pride shareholders. For a description of
the manner in which the mergers will be carried out, see "The Merger Agreement."

     This discussion assumes that shareholders hold Pride and Marine shares as
capital assets. Tax consequences that are different from or in addition to those
here described may apply to shareholders who are subject to special treatment
under U.S. tax law, such as:

     - tax-exempt organizations;

     - financial institutions, insurance companies, and broker-dealers;

     - persons who hold their Marine or Pride shares as part of a hedge,
       straddle, wash sale, synthetic security, conversion transaction or other
       integrated investment comprised of Marine or Pride shares and one or more
       other investments;

     - persons who acquired their shares in compensatory transactions; or

     - shareholders who are not U.S. persons within the meaning of the Internal
       Revenue Code (the "Code").

     THIS SUMMARY IS NOT A SUBSTITUTE FOR AN INDIVIDUAL ANALYSIS OF THE TAX
CONSEQUENCES OF THE MERGERS TO A MARINE OR PRIDE SHAREHOLDER. EACH SHAREHOLDER
SHOULD CONSULT A TAX ADVISER AS TO THE U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSEQUENCES OF
THE TRANSACTION, INCLUDING ANY SUCH CONSEQUENCES ARISING FROM THE PARTICULAR
FACTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE SHAREHOLDER. SHAREHOLDERS SHOULD ALSO CONSULT A
TAX ADVISOR AS TO ANY ESTATE, GIFT, STATE, LOCAL OR FOREIGN TAX CONSEQUENCES OF
THE TRANSACTION.

     This discussion is limited to U.S. federal income tax considerations and
does not address other U.S. federal tax, state, local or foreign tax
considerations or consequences. Furthermore, we have not obtained, nor do we
intend to obtain, a ruling from the Internal Revenue Service (the "Service")
with respect to the U.S. federal income tax consequences of the mergers. This
summary is not binding on the Service or the courts, and the Service or the
courts may disagree with the conclusions expressed herein. If the Service were
able to successfully challenge the tax-free status of the Marine merger, the
shareholders would be required to recognize gain or loss on each share of Marine
common stock exchanged for Pride common stock. In addition, Marine would
recognize gain in a substantial amount on the transfer of its assets in the
merger. Likewise, if the Service were able to successfully challenge the
tax-free status of the reincorporation merger, the shareholders would be
required to recognize gain or loss on each share of Pride common stock exchanged
for New Pride common stock. Pride would also recognize gain in a substantial
amount on the transfer of its assets in the reincorporation merger.

     The opinions of counsel described below will be based on representations
made by officers of Marine and Pride, which are contained in officers'
certificates, and upon existing U.S. federal income tax law, including
legislation, regulations, administrative rulings and court decisions that are in
effect on the date of this proxy statement/prospectus. Federal income tax law is
subject to change, and changes may have retroactive effect. In addition, counsel
have relied and will rely upon the accuracy of the information in this joint
proxy statement/prospectus and in other documents filed with the SEC by Marine
and Pride.

Any change in present law, or the failure of factual assumptions or
representations to be true, correct and complete in all material respects, could
affect the continuing validity of counsel's tax opinions.

  Tax Opinions

     It is a condition to Marine's obligation to close the mergers that Marine
shall have received from Porter & Hedges, L.L.P. its opinion dated the closing
date to the effect that, for United States federal income tax purposes, (i) the
Marine merger and the reincorporation merger will each qualify as a
reorganization under section 368(a) of the Code, (ii) no gain or loss will be
recognized by the shareholders of Marine who exchange Marine common stock solely
for Pride common stock pursuant to the Marine merger, and who then exchange such
Pride common stock solely for New Pride common stock pursuant to the
reincorporation merger, and (iii) no gain or loss will be recognized by Marine
or Pride on the transfer of its respective assets in the mergers.

     It is a condition to Pride's obligation to close the mergers that Pride
shall have received from Baker Botts L.L.P. its opinion dated the closing date
to the effect that, for United States federal income tax purposes, (i) the
Marine merger and the reincorporation merger will each qualify as a
reorganization under section 368(a) of the Code, (ii) no gain or loss will be
recognized by the shareholders of Pride, including the shareholders of Marine
who received Pride common stock in the Marine merger, who exchange Pride common
stock solely for New Pride common stock pursuant to the reincorporation merger,
and (iii) no gain or loss will be recognized by Marine or Pride on the transfer
of its respective assets in the mergers.

  Treatment of the Marine Shareholders as a Result of the Mergers

     Subject to the qualifications and limitations set forth in "Scope of
Discussion" above and assuming that the Marine merger and the reincorporation
merger each qualify as a reorganization under section 368(a) of the Code, in the
opinion of Porter & Hedges, L.L.P., the material United States federal income
tax consequences of the Marine merger and the reincorporation merger to the
shareholders of Marine are as follows:

     - No gain or loss will be recognized by the holders of Marine common stock
       upon the receipt of Pride common stock in exchange therefor, or upon the
       exchange of that Pride common stock for New Pride common stock.

     - The aggregate tax basis of the Pride common stock received in the Marine
       merger will be the same as the aggregate tax basis of the Marine common
       stock surrendered in the exchange. Likewise, the aggregate tax basis of
       the New Pride common stock received in the reincorporation merger will be
       the same as the aggregate tax basis of the Pride common stock surrendered
       in the exchange.

     - The holding period of the Pride common stock received by each holder of
       Marine common stock in the Marine merger will include the period for
       which the Marine common stock surrendered in the exchange was held,
       provided the Marine common stock surrendered was held as a capital asset
       at the time of the merger. Likewise, the holding period of the New Pride
       common stock received in the reincorporation merger in exchange for Pride
       common stock will include the period for which that Pride common stock
       was held (including any extended holding period described in the
       immediately preceding sentence), provided the Pride common stock
       surrendered was held as a capital asset at the time of the
       reincorporation merger.

  Treatment of the Pride Shareholders, Including the Former Marine Shareholders,
  as a Result of the Reincorporation Merger

     Subject to the qualifications and limitations set forth in "Scope of
Discussion" above and assuming that the reincorporation merger qualifies as a
reorganization under section 368(a) of the Code, in the opinion of Baker Botts
L.L.P., the material United States federal income tax consequences of the

reincorporation merger to the shareholders of Pride, including the former Marine
shareholders, are as follows:

     - No gain or loss will be recognized by the Pride shareholders, including
       the former Marine shareholders, upon the receipt of New Pride common
       stock in exchange for Pride common stock.

     - The aggregate tax basis of the New Pride common stock received in the
       merger will be the same as the aggregate tax basis of the Pride common
       stock surrendered in the exchange.

     - The holding period of the New Pride common stock received in the
       reincorporation merger by each holder of Pride common stock, including
       the shareholders of Marine who received Pride common stock in the Marine
       merger, will include the period for which the Pride common stock
       surrendered in the exchange was held, provided the Pride common stock
       surrendered was held as a capital asset at the time of the
       reincorporation merger.

  Treatment of Pride and Marine on the Transfer of Their Respective Assets in
  the Mergers

     Subject to the qualifications and limitations set forth in "Scope of
Discussion" above and assuming that the Marine merger and the reincorporation
merger qualify as reorganizations under section 368(a) of the Code, in the
opinion of Porter & Hedges, L.L.P. and Baker Botts L.L.P., the material United
States federal income tax consequences of the Marine merger and the
reincorporation merger to Pride and Marine are as follows:

     - No gain or loss will be recognized by Marine upon the transfer of its
       assets in the Marine merger to AM Merger, Inc.

     - No gain or loss will be recognized by Pride upon the transfer of its
       assets in the reincorporation merger to New Pride.

REGULATORY MATTERS

     Under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, the parties
cannot complete the Marine merger until they have notified and furnished
information to the Federal Trade Commission and the Antitrust Division of the
United States Department of Justice and a specified waiting period expires or is
terminated. Pride and Marine made their filings under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act
on June 13, 2001 and the waiting period expired on             , 2001; however,
this clearance process does not have the effect of conferring antitrust
immunity. Certain other countries in which Pride and Marine have operations also
may review the mergers under their antitrust laws. At any time before the
completion of the mergers, any relevant governmental authority or a private
person or entity could seek under antitrust laws, among other things, to enjoin
the mergers or to cause Pride or Marine to divest assets or businesses as a
condition to completing the mergers. Furthermore, any of the relevant
governmental authorities or a private person or entity could seek, under
antitrust laws, to take action against Pride or Marine after the completion of
the mergers. Pride and Marine are unable to predict whether any action will be
taken or what the outcome of any action may be.

     While no assurances can be given that the mergers will not be challenged
or, if challenged, Pride and Marine will prevail, based on the respective
positions of Pride, Marine and their competitors in the offshore contract
drilling industry, Pride and Marine believe that consummation of the mergers in
accordance with the terms of the merger agreement will not violate any antitrust
or other laws.

     The parties' obligation to complete the mergers is subject to the condition
that no statute, rule, regulation, executive order, decree, ruling or cease and
desist order shall have been entered which prohibits the completion of the
mergers and that no party to the merger agreement shall be subject to any
decree, order or injunction of a court of competent jurisdiction that prohibits
the completion of the mergers. The parties have agreed, however, that before
invoking these conditions, they will use commercially reasonable best efforts to
have the decree, order or injunction lifted or vacated.

FEDERAL SECURITIES LAWS CONSEQUENCES; RESALE RESTRICTIONS

     All shares of New Pride common stock received by shareholders of Marine
upon consummation of the mergers will be freely transferable by those holders
who are not deemed to be "affiliates" (as defined under the Securities Act but
generally including executive officers, directors and significant holders of
Marine common stock).

     Pursuant to the merger agreement, Marine and Pride has each agreed to use
its commercially reasonable best efforts to cause each person identified as an
affiliate for purposes of Rule 145 of the Securities Act and for purposes of
qualifying the mergers for pooling of interests accounting treatment (the "Rule
145 Affiliates") to deliver to Pride a written agreement that such person will
not sell, pledge, transfer or otherwise dispose of any shares of New Pride
common stock issued to such Rule 145 Affiliates in the mergers, except pursuant
to an effective registration statement or in compliance with Rule 145 or an
exemption from the registration requirements of the Securities Act. Marine and
Pride has each also agreed to use their commercially reasonable best efforts to
cause each person identified as a Rule 145 Affiliate of either Marine or Pride
to sign a written agreement that such Rule 145 Affiliate will not sell or in any
other way reduce such party's risk relative to shares of New Pride, Pride or
Marine common stock for the period of time commencing on the 30th day prior to
the effective time of the mergers and ending at such time as financial results
covering at least 30 days of post-merger operations of New Pride have been
published, except as permitted by applicable SEC Accounting Bulletins. New Pride
will be entitled to place restrictive legends on any shares of New Pride common
stock received by Rule 145 Affiliates.

     This joint proxy statement/prospectus does not cover any resales of the New
Pride common stock to be received by Marine's and Pride's shareholders in the
mergers, and no person is authorized to make any use of this joint proxy
statement/prospectus in connection with any resale.

RIGHTS OF DISSENTING SHAREHOLDERS

  Marine Shareholders

     Marine shareholders will not be entitled to any appraisal rights under the
Texas Business Corporation Act or any other applicable law in connection with
the mergers.

  Pride Shareholders

     Pride shareholders will not be entitled to any appraisal rights under the
Louisiana Business Corporation Law or any other applicable law in connection
with the mergers.

NEW YORK STOCK EXCHANGE LISTING

     New Pride has applied to list the shares of New Pride common stock on the
New York Stock Exchange under the symbol "PDE." The completion of the mergers is
conditioned upon the NYSE's approval of New Pride's listing application.

                              THE MERGER AGREEMENT

     The following is a summary of the material terms of the merger agreement, a
copy of which is attached as Annex A to this joint proxy statement/prospectus
and is incorporated in this joint proxy statement/prospectus by reference. This
summary is qualified in its entirety by reference to the merger agreement. You
should read the entire merger agreement because it, and not this summary, is the
legal document that governs the merger.

     The merger agreement sets forth the terms of the two mergers, the Marine
merger and the reincorporation merger.

MARINE MERGER

     At the effective time of the Marine merger, Marine will merge with and into
AM Merger, Inc., a subsidiary of Pride formed for purposes of the merger
agreement. AM Merger, Inc., which will be renamed Pride Marine, Inc., will be
the surviving corporation of the Marine merger, and the separate corporate
existence of Marine will cease to exist. The Marine merger will take place
promptly after all of the conditions described in "-- Conditions to the Mergers"
are satisfied or waived. The Marine merger will be effective at the time Pride
and Marine file a certificate of merger with the Secretary of State of the State
of Delaware and articles of merger with the Secretary of the State of Texas or
at a later time as they agree and specify in the certificate and articles of
merger.

     In the Marine merger, each share of Marine common stock will be converted
into one share of Pride common stock.

     The Marine merger has the effect of converting Marine into a subsidiary of
Pride, and converting Marine shares into Pride shares.

REINCORPORATION MERGER

     Following the effective time of the Marine merger and at the effective time
of the reincorporation merger, Pride will merge with and into New Pride, a
Delaware corporation. New Pride will be the surviving corporation and the
separate corporate existence of Pride will cease to exist. The reincorporation
merger will take place promptly after the effective time of the Marine merger.
The reincorporation merger will be effective at the time Pride and New Pride
file certificates of merger with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware
and with the Secretary of the State of Louisiana or at a later time as they
agree and specify in the Delaware certificate of merger.

     In the reincorporation merger, each holder of Pride common stock (including
holders of the shares issued to the former Marine shareholders) will receive,
for each Pride share of common stock held, one share of common stock of New
Pride.

     The reincorporation merger has the effect of changing the state of
incorporation of the combined company from Louisiana to Delaware, and converting
Pride shares into New Pride shares.

COVENANTS

  Interim Operations

     Pride and Marine agreed to take or refrain from taking the actions
described below from the date of the merger agreement, May 23, 2001, until the
mergers are completed or the merger agreement is terminated. Compliance with
these covenants may be modified to allow the transactions contemplated by the
merger agreement or by the written consent of Pride and Marine.

     Except as disclosed in the schedules to the merger agreement, each of Pride
and Marine will use its commercially reasonable best efforts to:

       breach of any of its representations and warranties in the merger
       agreement;

     - not grant any new options, warrants or other rights to acquire shares of
       its capital stock;

     - not amend or modify any options, warrants or other rights to acquire
       shares of its capital stock existing on the date of the merger agreement;

       required by law) any existing employee benefit plan in any material
       respect, except for changes that are less favorable to the plan
       participants;

     - not terminate any executive officer without cause or give any executive
       officer a right to terminate employment if the termination would require
       enhanced separation payments at the time of the merger, except as
       permitted by the merger agreement and except as approved by good faith
       action of its board of directors after the other party has received
       advance written notice of the proposed action and the party has consulted
       in advance with the other party regarding the action;

     - not permit any holder of a stock option to have shares withheld upon

       with the board's fiduciary duties.

  Additional Agreements

     Pursuant to the merger agreement, Pride and Marine also agreed that:

     - the parties will promptly make their respective filings and make any
       other required submissions under the U.S. Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust
       Improvements Act of 1976 and any applicable non-U.S. competition,
       antitrust or premerger notification laws with respect to the mergers;

     - the parties will use their commercially reasonable best efforts to
       cooperate with one another in:

      - determining which filings the parties must make before the effective
        time of the mergers with, and which consents, approvals, permits or
        authorizations the parties must obtain before the effective time of the
        mergers from, governmental or regulatory authorities of the United
        States and other jurisdictions in connection with the mergers and the
        related transactions; and

       with any governmental entity regarding any filing, investigation or other
       inquiry about the merger agreement or related

       transactions unless the other party is consulted in advance and given the
       opportunity to attend and participate;

     - the parties will furnish each other copies of all correspondence, filings
       and communications with any governmental or regulatory authorities on the
       one hand, and their affiliates and representatives on the other hand,

     - the parties will furnish each other with such necessary information and
       reasonable assistance that the other parties reasonably request in
       connection with their preparation of necessary filings, registrations or

     - the parties will use their commercially reasonable best efforts to avoid
       the entry of, or have vacated, terminated or modified, any decree, order
       or judgment that would prevent or delay the closing of the mergers;

       any and all steps necessary to obtain any consents or eliminate any
       impediments to the mergers;

      - dispose of any its assets or limit its freedom of action with respect to

        action with respect to any of its businesses;

      individually or in the aggregate, have a material adverse effect on either
      party or on New Pride;

     - the parties will use commercially reasonable best efforts to cause the
       mergers to qualify as a reorganization within the meaning of Section

       actions to be taken, or fail to take actions to prevent either of the
       mergers from qualifying as a reorganization within the meaning of Section
       368(a) or cause the Marine shareholders who exchange Marine common stock
       solely for Pride common stock to recognize taxable gain under Section

     - the parties will provide to each other access to their respective
       properties, records, files and other information as the other parties may

     - Pride will cause New Pride to prepare and submit to the New York Stock
       Exchange a listing application covering New Pride's common stock issuable
       in the reincorporation merger and will use commercially reasonable
       efforts to obtain, before the effective time of the reincorporation
       merger, the NYSE's approval for the listing of those share;

     - Pride will promptly prepare and submit to the New York Stock Exchange a
       listing application covering the shares of Pride common stock covered by
       the registration statement of which this joint proxy statement/prospectus
       is a part and shall use commercially reasonable best efforts to obtain,
       before the effective time of the merger, the NYSE's approval for the
       listing of those shares;

     - the parties will use their commercially reasonable best efforts to have
       timely delivered to the other party a "comfort" letter from their
       independent public accountants;

     - each party will provide each other party, at least five business days
       prior to the effective time of the Marine merger, a list of persons who
       may be its Rule 145 affiliates, and each party will use commercially
       reasonable best efforts to obtain from their respective Rule 145
       affiliates an undertaking not to transfer Pride or New Pride common stock
       issued to such person pursuant to the mergers except (1) pursuant to an
       effective registration statement, (2) in compliance with Rule 145 or (3)
       pursuant to an exemption from the registration requirements under the
       Securities Act;

     - each party will pay all costs and expenses incurred by it in connection
       with the mergers, regardless of whether the mergers become effective,
       other than costs that are specified to be shared or reimbursed under the
       merger agreement;

     - neither of the parties will take any action to terminate their respective
       shareholder rights plans, redeem any of the rights issued thereunder,
       amend their respective rights agreements in a manner adverse to the other
       party or cause any person to trigger the issuance of rights, except for
       actions taken to enter into an agreement that is superior to the mergers;

     - the parties will take all necessary action to convene meetings of their
       respective shareholders as promptly as practicable to consider and vote
       on the merger agreement and the approval of the mergers, and to use their
       best efforts to hold their respective shareholder meetings on the same
       day;

     - the parties will not take any action or fail to take any action which
       would prevent or likely prevent the mergers from qualifying for pooling
       of interest accounting treatment;

     - each person who had been an officer or director of Pride or Marine before
       the mergers will be indemnified by New Pride after the mergers to the
       fullest extent permitted under applicable law. The rights of these
       officers and directors will be in addition to any rights they may have
       under New Pride's certificate of incorporation and bylaws. The merger
       agreement further provides that, for six years after the merger, New
       Pride will maintain officers' and directors' liability insurance policies
       that provide coverage to the existing Pride and Marine officers and
       directors covered by an existing policy that are substantially no less
       advantageous to the indemnified parties than the existing policies. New
       Pride will not, however, be required to pay annual premiums in excess of
       150% of the sum of the last annual premium paid by each of Pride or
       Marine before the execution of the merger agreement;

     - Pride will assume all of Marine's employee stock options, incentives,
       awards and benefits plans identified in the merger agreement on the same
       terms and conditions as were applicable before execution of the merger
       agreement. Pride will take all necessary action to reserve for issuance a
       sufficient number of shares of Pride common stock to do so;

     - New Pride will assume all of Pride's employee stock options, incentives,
       awards and benefits plans identified in the merger agreement (including
       all of the Marine stock options, incentives, awards and benefits plans
       assumed by Pride) on the same terms and conditions as were applicable
       before the closing of the mergers. New Pride will take all necessary
       action to reserve for issuance a sufficient number of shares of New Pride
       common stock to do so;

     - the parties agree that all employees of Marine and Pride before the
       mergers will be employed by New Pride after the mergers. However, New
       Pride does not have any obligations to continue employing such employees
       for any length of time thereafter. Until otherwise determined, benefit
       plans of both Pride and Marine will remain effective after the mergers If
       such a plan is not continued, New Pride will continue the plan for a
       period of one year after the mergers if it is not less favorable in the
       aggregate, to the employees covered, except to the extent compliance with
       this would be unduly burdensome;

     - New Pride will file with the SEC a registration statement on an
       appropriate form regarding New Pride common stock subject to options or
       other equity-based awards of Pride and Marine;

     - Pride and all of its subsidiaries will use all commercially reasonable
       best efforts to prevent a change of control of Pride or any other event
       which constitutes a default under any Pride indebtedness prior to the
       closing of the Marine merger;

     - Marine will use its commercially reasonable best efforts to obtain and
       deliver to Pride a letter from KPMG LLP in which KPMG LLP concurs with
       the conclusion of Marine's management that no condition exists that would
       preclude a pooling of interests accounting treatment; and

     - Pride will use its commercially reasonable best efforts to obtain and
       deliver to Marine a letter from PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP in which
       PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP concurs with conclusion of Pride's management
       that no condition exists that would preclude a pooling of interests
       accounting treatment.

  No Solicitation

     Neither Pride nor Marine will permit any of its officers, directors,
employees, agents or representatives, directly or indirectly, to solicit,
initiate or encourage any inquiry, proposal or offer to merge, consolidate,
purchase or otherwise acquire:

     - 15% or more of the consolidated assets, net revenues or net income of the
       respective party; or

     - 15% or more of any class of capital stock of the respective party.

     Any such proposal, offer or transaction may be referred to in this joint
proxy statement/prospectus, respectively, as a "Pride acquisition proposal" or a
"Marine acquisition proposal."

     Each party agreed not to cooperate with, assist, participate or engage in
any discussions or negotiations concerning an acquisition proposal with respect
to that party by a third party. Both parties agreed to cease immediately and
terminate any existing negotiations with any parties with respect to any of the
foregoing. However, nothing contained in the merger agreement prevents either
party from:

     - complying with Rule 14e-2 promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act
       of 1934 with regard to a Pride or a Marine acquisition proposal; or

     - before the party's shareholders approve the mergers, providing
       information to or engaging in any negotiations with any person who has
       made an unsolicited bona fide written acquisition proposal with respect
       to all the outstanding shares of the party's common stock or all or
       substantially all the assets of the party that, in the good faith
       judgment of the board of directors of the party, taking into account the
       likelihood of financing, and based on the advice of a financial adviser
       of recognized national reputation, a written summary of which is promptly
       provided to the other party, is superior to the merger, if the party's
       board of directors, after consultation with its outside legal counsel,
       determines that the failure to do so would be inconsistent with its
       fiduciary obligations. Any information so provided is required to be
       provided pursuant to a confidentiality and standstill agreement at least
       as favorable to the party as the confidentiality and standstill agreement
       entered into in connection with the mergers and that does not contain
       terms that prevent the party from complying with its no-solicitation
       obligations under the merger agreement.

     If either party intends to participate in any discussions or negotiations
or to provide any information to any third party, that party is required to:

     - give prompt prior oral and written notice to the other party of each such
       action;

     - immediately notify the other party orally and in writing of any requests
       for information or the receipt of any acquisition proposal or inquiry
       with respect to or that could lead to an acquisition proposal, including
       the identity of the person or group (1) engaging in such discussions or

       negotiations, (2) requesting such information or (3) making such
       acquisition proposal, and the material terms and conditions of any
       acquisition proposal;

     - keep the other party fully informed on a timely basis of the status and
       details, including any changes or proposed changes to such status or
       details, of any such requests, acquisition proposals or inquiries; and

     - provide to the other party as soon as practicable after receipt or
       delivery thereof, copies of all correspondence and other written material
       sent or provided from any third party, or sent or provided to any third
       party, in connection with any acquisition proposal.

the mergers.

TERMINATION OF THE MERGER AGREEMENT

     Marine and Pride may terminate the merger agreement by mutual written
consent.

     Either the board of directors of Marine or Pride may terminate the merger
agreement if:

     - the parties have not completed the mergers by December 31, 2001, and the
       party desiring to terminate the merger agreement for this reason has not
       failed to perform or observe in any material respect any of its
       obligations under the merger agreement in any manner that caused the
       merger not to occur on or before that date;

     - at a meeting of the shareholders of Marine or of Pride, the shareholders
       do not approve the merger agreement; or

     - a U.S. federal or state or non-U.S. court of competent jurisdiction or
       federal or state or non-U.S. governmental, regulatory or administrative
       agency or commission has issued an order, decree or ruling or taken any
       other action permanently restraining, enjoining or otherwise prohibiting
       the mergers, and this order, decree, ruling or other action has become
       final and unappealable. However, the party seeking to terminate the
       merger agreement for this reason must have complied with the covenants in
       the merger agreement which generally relate to antitrust, tax and other
       governmental filings and approvals and as to other matters used its
       commercially reasonable best efforts to remove this injunction, decree or
       order.

     Either Pride or Marine may terminate the merger agreement if:

     - the non-terminating party has breached any representation, warranty,
       covenant or agreement in the merger agreement, or any representation or
       warranty of the non-terminating party has become untrue, in either case
       such that a condition to the merger would not be met, and such breach is
       not curable or, if curable, is not cured within 30 days after the
       terminating party gives written notice of the breach to the
       non-terminating party, and the terminating party is not, at that time, in
       material breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement in
       the merger agreement; or

     - the board of directors of the non-terminating party has withdrawn or
       materially modified, in a manner adverse to the terminating party, its
       approval or recommendation of the merger agreement, or recommended a
       competing acquisition proposal for the non-terminating party, or resolved
       to do so.

     In addition, either Pride or Marine may terminate the merger agreement if,
before its shareholders approve the merger agreement, the terminating party
concurrently enters into a binding definitive written agreement concerning a
transaction that constitutes a superior proposal for the terminating party after
the board of directors of the terminating party determines that:

     - proceeding with the mergers would be inconsistent with its fiduciary
       obligations by reason of the superior proposal; and

     - there is a substantial likelihood that the approval by the terminating
       party's shareholders of the merger agreement with the non-terminating
       party will not be obtained by reason of the existence of the superior
       proposal for the terminating party.

However, neither Pride nor Marine may effect that termination:

     - unless the terminating party has complied in all material respects with
       the non-solicitation provisions of the merger agreement;

     - if the non-terminating party is entitled to terminate the merger
       agreement because the terminating party has breached any representation,
       warranty, covenant or agreement in the merger agreement, or any
       representation or warranty of the terminating party shall have become
       materially untrue;

     - unless and until the non-terminating party receives at least 10 business
       days' prior written notice from the terminating party of its intention to
       effect that termination;

     - during that 10-business day period, the terminating party considers, and
       causes its respective financial and legal advisors to consider, any
       adjustment in the terms and conditions of the merger agreement that the
       non-terminating party may propose; and

     - until the terminating party has paid to the non-terminating party the $50
       million termination fee described under "-- Expenses and Termination
       Fees."

     No party may terminate the merger agreement after the effectiveness of the
mergers.

TERMINATION FEES AND EXPENSE REIMBURSEMENT

     Whether or not the mergers are completed, all costs and expenses incurred
in connection with the merger agreement and the transactions contemplated by the
merger agreement will be paid by the party incurring those expenses, except as
expressly provided in the merger agreement.

     Marine is required to pay Pride a cash termination fee of $50 million at
the time of the termination if the merger agreement is terminated as follows:

     - by Marine or Pride because Marine's shareholders do not approve the
       merger agreement after the public announcement of a competing acquisition
       proposal for Marine, whether or not that proposal is still pending or has
       been consummated;

     - by Pride because the board of directors of Marine has withdrawn or
       materially modified, in a manner adverse to Pride, its approval or
       recommendation of the merger agreement, or recommended a competing
       acquisition proposal for Marine, or resolved to do so; or

     - by Marine because the board of directors of Marine determines that
       proceeding with the mergers would be inconsistent with its fiduciary
       duties and concurrently enters into a binding definitive agreement
       concerning a transaction that constitutes a superior proposal for Marine.

     Pride is required to pay Marine a cash termination fee of $50 million at
the time of the termination if the merger agreement is terminated as follows:

     - by Marine or Pride because Pride's shareholders do not approve the merger
       agreement after the public announcement of a competing acquisition
       proposal for Pride, whether or not that proposal is still pending or has
       been consummated;

     - by Marine because the board of directors of Pride has withdrawn or
       materially modified, in a manner adverse to Marine, its approval or
       recommendation of the merger agreement, or recommended a competing
       acquisition proposal for Marine, or resolved to do so; or

     - by Pride because the board of directors of Pride determines that
       proceeding with the mergers would be inconsistent with its fiduciary
       duties and concurrently enters into a binding definitive agreement
       concerning a transaction that constitutes a superior proposal for Pride.

     If the merger agreement is terminated because the shareholders of Marine do
not approve the mergers and there was no public announcement of a competing
acquisition proposal for Marine before the shareholders' vote, then Marine is
required to pay Pride a fee of $5 million to reimburse it for its costs and
expenses incurred in connection with the mergers and related transactions.

     If the merger agreement is terminated because the shareholders of Pride do
not approve the mergers and there was no public announcement of a competing
acquisition proposal for Pride before the shareholders' vote, then Pride is
required to pay Marine a fee of $5 million to reimburse it for its costs and
expenses incurred in connection with the mergers and related transactions.

AMENDMENT

     The parties may amend the merger agreement, by action taken or authorized
by their boards of directors, at any time before or after approval by the
shareholders of the parties of the matters presented in connection with the
mergers. After any shareholder approval, the parties may not amend the merger
agreement if further approval by those shareholders is required by law, unless
such further approval is obtained.

                       RECIPROCAL STOCK OPTION AGREEMENTS

     General.  As a condition and inducement to each party's willingness to
enter into the merger agreement, each party requested, and the other party
agreed, to grant the requesting party an irrevocable option to purchase up to
19.9% of the granting party's issued and outstanding common stock. The terms of
the option granted by Pride with respect to its common stock (the "Pride Stock
Option Agreement") are virtually identical to the terms of the option granted by
Marine with respect to its common stock (the "Marine Stock Option Agreement").
Both agreements are dated as of May 23, 2001 and are attached as Annex F and G
to this joint proxy statement/prospectus.

     Number of Shares and Exercise Price.  The number of shares subject to each
option agreement adjusts to equal 19.9% of the number of issued and outstanding
shares of Pride or Marine common stock in the event that any additional shares
of Pride or Marine common stock are issued or otherwise become outstanding after
May 23, 2001, or any shares of Pride or Marine common stock are redeemed,
repurchased, retired or otherwise cease to be outstanding after May 23, 2001.
The number of Marine shares subject to the Pride Stock Option Agreement is
initially established at 11,680,759. The number of Pride shares subject to the
Marine Stock Option Agreement is initially established at 14,645,693. The per
share price (the "exercise price") of the Marine shares for which the option
granted in the Pride Stock Option Agreement is exercisable is $27.72, and the
exercise price of the Pride shares for which the option granted in the Marine
Stock Option Agreement is exercisable is $32.65. Each exercise price was
determined based upon the closing price of Pride and Marine common stock on the
New York Stock Exchange on the dates the option agreements were signed.

     Adjustments.  The exercise price and the type and number of shares or
securities subject to the stock option agreements will be adjusted appropriately
for any stock dividend, split-up, merger, recapitalization, combination,
conversion, exchange of shares, spin-off or similar transactions in respect of
the Marine or Pride common stock.

     Exercisability.  Each of the stock options is exercisable, in whole or in
part, at any time and from time to time following the occurrence of an exercise
date (as defined below) and shall remain in full force and effect until the
earliest to occur of:

          (1) the effective time (as defined in the merger agreement),

          (2) twelve months after the first receipt by the grantee of written
     notice from the grantor of the occurrence of an exercise date; or

          (3) the date of termination of the merger agreement, unless the
     grantor is obligated to pay a $50 million fee pursuant to the merger
     agreement in connection with such termination (see "The Merger
     Agreement -- Effect of Termination").

     An "exercise date" is the date on which any of the events giving rise to
the obligation of Marine or Pride to pay the other party the $50 million fee
pursuant to the termination fee provisions of the merger agreement. These events
include the termination by Pride or Marine, as the case may be, of the merger
agreement following the failure of the other party's shareholders to vote in
favor of approval of the merger agreement or the withdrawal or modification of
the other party's board of directors' recommendation to the other party's
shareholders in favor of approval of the merger agreement in connection with a
competing proposal for a combination between the other party and a third party,
and in certain other circumstances.

     Put Right.  Pursuant to the terms of the reciprocal stock option
agreements, the grantee of the option may require the grantor to purchase from
the grantee that portion of the option relating to all or any part of the
unexercised option shares (or as to which portion the option has been exercised
but the option closing has not yet occurred) and all or any portion of the
shares of the grantor's common stock purchased by the grantee pursuant to the
option and with respect to which the grantee then has ownership. The put right
may be exercised by the grantee at any time and from time to time after the
occurrence of an exercise event and before 120 days after the expiration of the
relevant option.

     Registration Rights.  The grantee will have rights to require the
registration under the securities laws of any shares purchased pursuant to the
option, which would allow those shares to be resold by the grantee.

     Profit Limitation.  The stock option agreements limits the total profit
that the grantee may receive to $50 million. Each grantee's total profit is
equal to the aggregate amount (before taxes) of:

          (1) all amounts received by the grantee pursuant to the grantor's
     repurchase obligation (i.e., the put right), less amounts paid by the
     grantee for shares being repurchased pursuant to the put right;

          (2) the amounts received by or being paid to the grantee pursuant to
     the arm's length sale of all or part of the option shares, less the
     grantee's purchase price for such option shares; and

          (3) all amounts received by or being paid to the grantee pursuant to
     the termination fee provisions of the merger agreement.

          UNAUDITED CONDENSED PRO FORMA COMBINED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

     The following unaudited condensed pro forma combined balance sheet as of
March 31, 2001 and the unaudited condensed pro forma combined statements of
operations for the three-month period ended March 31, 2001 and for each of the
years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2000, illustrate the effect of
the mergers under the pooling of interests method of accounting.

     The historical balance sheet and results of operations information for
Pride has been derived from Pride's audited and unaudited consolidated financial
statements for the periods presented incorporated by reference in this joint
proxy statement/prospectus. The historical balance sheet and results of
operations information for Marine has been derived from Marine's audited and
unaudited consolidated financial statements for the periods presented
incorporated by reference in this joint proxy statement/prospectus. The
unaudited condensed pro forma combined balance sheet has been prepared assuming
the mergers were consummated on March 31, 2001. The unaudited condensed pro
forma combined statements of operations have been prepared assuming that the
mergers were consummated on January 1, 1998.

     The pro forma adjustments and the resulting unaudited condensed pro forma
financial statements are based upon available information and certain
assumptions and estimates described in the notes to unaudited condensed pro
forma combined financial statements. In preparing these pro forma financial
statements, Pride's management has reviewed the accounting practices followed by
Marine, and Marine's management has reviewed the accounting practices followed
by Pride, to determine whether any pro forma adjustments were required for the
combining companies to conform to the same accounting practices. No significant
differences in accounting practices were identified by Pride's management or by
Marine's management and hence no pro forma adjustments were made in this
respect.

     The condensed pro forma combined financial statements do not purport to
represent what the financial position or results of operations of New Pride
actually would have been had the mergers occurred on the dates indicated or to
project New Pride's financial position or results of operations for any future
date or period. Furthermore, the unaudited condensed pro forma combined
financial statements do not reflect any cost savings or other synergies which
may result from the mergers or any other changes which may occur as the result
of post-combination activities and other matters. In addition, the unaudited
condensed pro forma combined statements of operations exclude non-recurring
charges directly attributable to the mergers that will be charged to operations
in the quarter in which the mergers are actually consummated.

     The unaudited condensed pro forma combined financial statements and the
notes thereto should be read in conjunction with the historical consolidated
financial statements of Pride, including the notes thereto, and the historical
consolidated financial statements of Marine, including the notes thereto, all of
which are incorporated by reference in this joint proxy statement/prospectus.

      NOTES TO UNAUDITED CONDENSED PRO FORMA COMBINED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

1. BACKGROUND

     In May 2001, Pride and Marine entered into a definitive agreement to
combine in a tax-free, stock-for-stock transaction. Pursuant to the agreement,
shareholders of each company will receive one share in a newly formed Delaware
company for each share of Pride or Marine common stock that they currently own.
The combined company will be named Pride International, Inc.

2. BASIS OF PRESENTATION

     The unaudited condensed pro forma combined balance sheet gives effect to
the proposed mergers by combining the respective balance sheets of Pride and
Marine at March 31, 2001 on a pooling of interests basis. The unaudited
condensed pro forma combined statements of operations have been prepared
assuming that the proposed mergers were consummated on January 1, 1998.

3. MANAGEMENT ASSUMPTIONS

     The unaudited pro forma financial statements reflect the following pro
forma adjustments to effect the mergers on a pooling of interests basis.

          (a) Current Liabilities -- Represents estimated direct costs
     associated with the mergers, including financial advisor, attorney,
     accountant and filing fees and other expenses, which approximate $25
     million ($21 million net of income taxes assuming 50% are deductible for
     tax purposes). These non-recurring costs, which are subject to change, will
     be charged to earnings in the quarter in which the mergers are consummated.
     It is expected that substantially all of the direct costs associated with
     the transaction will be paid within one year after the mergers are
     consummated.

          (b) Diluted Weighted Average Shares Outstanding -- Represents the
     adjustment to include in pro forma diluted weighted average shares
     outstanding, shares issuable by Pride pursuant to convertible debt
     securities that were excluded from Pride's historical diluted weighted
     average shares outstanding as their effect was antidilutive.

4. EARNINGS PER SHARE

     Basic net earnings per share has been computed based on the weighted
average number of shares of common stock of Pride and Marine outstanding during
each period. Diluted net earnings per share has been computed based on the
weighted average number of shares of common stock and common stock equivalents
of Pride and Marine outstanding during each period, as if stock options,
convertible debentures and other convertible debt were converted into common
stock, after giving retroactive effect to the elimination of interest expense,
net of income tax, applicable to the convertible subordinated debentures and
other convertible debt.

     The calculation of diluted weighted average shares outstanding excludes 0.8
million, 7.8 million and 15.9 million common shares issuable pursuant to
outstanding options, warrants, convertible notes, convertible debentures and
other convertible debt for the three months ended March 31, 2001 and the years
ended December 31, 2000 and 1999, respectively, because their effect was
antidilutive. There were 0.6 million, 1.3 million and 2.4 million stock options
outstanding at March 31, 2001, December 31, 2000 and December 31, 1998,
respectively, which were not included in the computation of diluted weighted
average shares outstanding because the exercise price of the options was greater
than the average market price of the common shares during those periods.

                   DESCRIPTION OF CAPITAL STOCK OF NEW PRIDE

     The following description of New Pride's common stock, preferred stock,
certificate of incorporation and bylaws to be in effect upon completion of the
mergers is a summary only and is subject to the complete text of New Pride's
certificate of incorporation and bylaws, which are attached to this joint proxy
statement/prospectus as Annexes D and E, respectively, and New Pride's rights
agreement, the form of which is filed as an exhibit to the registration
statement of which this joint proxy statement/prospectus is a part. You are
encouraged to read those documents carefully.

     New Pride's authorized capital stock consists of 400,000,000 shares of
common stock, par value $.01 per share, and 50,000,000 shares of preferred
stock, par value $.01 per share.

COMMON STOCK

     The holders of New Pride common stock are entitled to one vote per share on
all matters to be voted on by stockholders generally, including the election of
directors. There are no cumulative voting rights, meaning that the holders of a
majority of the shares voting for the election of directors can elect all of the
directors standing for election.

     New Pride common stock carries no preemptive or other subscription rights
to purchase shares of its stock and is not convertible, redeemable or assessable
or entitled to the benefits of any sinking fund. Holders of New Pride common
stock will be entitled to dividends in the amounts and at the times declared by
its board of directors out of funds legally available for the payment of
dividends.

     If New Pride is liquidated, dissolved or wound up, the holders of its
common stock will share pro rata in its assets after satisfaction of all of its
liabilities and the prior rights of any outstanding class of its preferred
stock.

PREFERRED STOCK

     New Pride's board of directors has the authority, without stockholder
approval, to issue shares of preferred stock in one or more series and to fix
the number of shares and terms of each series. The board may determine the
designation and other terms of each series, including, among others:

     - dividend rights;

     - voting powers;

     - preemptive rights;

     - conversion rights;

     - redemption rights; and

     - liquidation preferences.

     The issuance of preferred stock, while providing desired flexibility in
connection with possible acquisitions and other corporate purposes, could
adversely affect the voting power of holders of common stock. It also could
affect the likelihood that holders of common stock will receive dividend
payments and payments upon liquidation.

     For purposes of the rights plan described below, New Pride's board of
directors has designated 4,000,000 shares of preferred stock to constitute the
Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock. For a description of the rights
plan, see "-- Stockholder Rights Plan."

ANTI-TAKEOVER PROVISIONS OF NEW PRIDE'S CERTIFICATE OF INCORPORATION AND BYLAWS

     New Pride's certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that
could delay or make more difficult the acquisition of control of New Pride
through a hostile tender offer, open market purchases, proxy contest, merger or
other takeover attempt that a stockholder might consider in his or her best

interest, including those attempts that might result in a premium over the
market price of New Pride's common stock.

  Authorized but Unissued Stock

     New Pride has 400,000,000 authorized shares of common stock and 50,000,000
authorized shares of preferred stock as compared with a total of 400,000
authorized shares of common stock and 70,000,000 shares of preferred stock of
Pride and Marine on a combined basis. One of the consequences of New Pride's
authorized but unissued common stock and undesignated preferred stock may be to
enable New Pride's board of directors to make more difficult or to discourage an
attempt to obtain control of New Pride. If, in the exercise of its fiduciary
obligations, New Pride's board of directors determined that a takeover proposal
was not in New Pride's best interest, the board could authorize the issuance of
those shares without stockholder approval. The shares could be issued in one or
more transactions that might prevent or make the completion of the change of
control transaction more difficult or costly by:

     - diluting the voting or other rights of the proposed acquiror or insurgent
       stockholder group;

     - creating a substantial voting block in institutional or other hands that
       might undertake to support the position of the incumbent board; or

     - effecting an acquisition that might complicate or preclude the takeover.

     In this regard, New Pride's certificate of incorporation grants its board
of directors broad power to establish the rights and preferences of the
authorized and unissued preferred stock. New Pride's board could establish one
or more series of preferred stock that entitle holders to:

     - vote separately as a class on any proposed merger or consolidation;

     - cast a proportionately larger vote together with the common stock on any
       transaction or for all purposes;

     - elect directors having terms of office or voting rights greater than
       those of other directors;

     - convert preferred stock into a greater number of shares of common stock
       or other securities;

     - demand redemption at a specified price under prescribed circumstances
       related to a change of control of New Pride; or

     - exercise other rights designed to impede a takeover.

  Stockholder Action by Written Consent; Special Meetings of Stockholders

     New Pride's certificate of incorporation provides that no action that is
required or permitted to be taken by New Pride's stockholders at any annual or
special meeting may be taken by written consent of stockholders in lieu of a
meeting, and that special meetings of stockholders may be called only by the
board of directors, the chairman of the board or the president. These provisions
of the certificate of incorporation may only be amended or repealed by a vote of
80% of the voting power of New Pride's outstanding common stock.

  Amendment of the Bylaws

     Under Delaware law, the power to adopt, amend or repeal bylaws is conferred
upon the stockholders. A corporation may, however, in its certificate of
incorporation also confer upon the board of directors the power to adopt, amend
or repeal its bylaws. New Pride's certificate of incorporation and bylaws grant
its board of directors the power to adopt, amend and repeal its bylaws at any
regular or special meeting of the board on the affirmative vote of a majority of
the directors then in office. New Pride's stockholders may also adopt, amend or
repeal New Pride's bylaws by a vote of a majority of the voting power of New
Pride's outstanding voting stock.

  Removal of Directors

     Directors may be removed with or without cause by a vote of a majority of
the voting power of New Pride's outstanding voting stock. A vacancy on the board
of directors of New Pride may be filled by a vote of a majority of the directors
in office or by the stockholders, and a director elected to fill a vacancy
serves until the next annual meeting of stockholders.

  Advance Notice Procedure for Director Nominations and Stockholder Proposals

     New Pride's bylaws provide that advance notice must be given to nominate
candidates for election as directors or to make proposals for consideration at
annual meetings of stockholders. Notice of a stockholder's intent to nominate a
director or to make proposals must be delivered to or mailed and received at New
Pride's principal executive offices not later than 120 days prior to the
scheduled annual meeting date. If that date is more than 30 days after the
anniversary date of the preceding year's annual meeting and if less than 100
days' prior notice or public disclosure of the scheduled meeting date is made,
the notice must be received not later than 10 days following the earlier of the
day on which notice of the meeting was mailed to stockholders or the day on
which the public disclosure was made.

     These procedures may limit the ability of stockholders to bring business
before a stockholders meeting, including the nomination of directors and the
consideration of any transaction that could result in a change in control and
that may result in a premium to New Pride's stockholders.

STOCKHOLDER RIGHTS PLAN

     New Pride has adopted a preferred share purchase rights plan that will be
effective upon completion of the reincorporation merger. Under the plan, each
share of New Pride common stock will include one right to purchase preferred
stock. The rights will separate from the common stock and become exercisable (1)
ten days after public announcement that a person or group of affiliated or
associated persons has acquired, or obtained the right to acquire, beneficial
ownership of 15% of the outstanding common stock or (2) ten business days
following the start of a tender offer or exchange offer that would result in a
person's acquiring beneficial ownership of 15% of the outstanding common stock.
A 15% beneficial owner is referred to as an "acquiring person" under the plan.

     New Pride's board of directors can elect to delay the separation of the
rights from the common stock beyond the ten-day periods referred to above. The
plan also confers on the New Pride board the discretion to increase or decrease
the level of ownership that causes a person to become an acquiring person. Until
the rights are separately distributed, the rights will be evidenced by the
common stock certificates and will be transferred with and only with the common
stock certificates.

     After the rights are separately distributed, each right will entitle the
holder to purchase from New Pride one one-hundredth of a share of Series A
Junior Participating Preferred Stock for a purchase price of $     . The rights
will expire at the close of business on September 30, 2011, unless New Pride
redeems or exchanges them earlier as described below.

     If a person becomes an acquiring person, the rights will become rights to
purchase shares of New Pride's common stock for one-half the current market
price, as defined in the rights agreement, of the common stock. This occurrence
is referred to as a "flip-in event" under the plan. After any flip-in event, all
rights that are beneficially owned by an acquiring person, or by certain related
parties, will be null and void. New Pride's board of directors has the power to
decide that a particular tender or exchange offer for all outstanding shares of
New Pride's common stock is fair to and otherwise in the best interests of its
stockholders. If the board makes this determination, the purchase of shares
under the offer will not be a flip-in event.

     If, after there is an acquiring person, New Pride is acquired in a merger
or other business combination transaction or 50% or more of New Pride's assets,
earning power or cash flow are sold or transferred, each holder of a right will
have the right to purchase shares of common stock of the acquiring company at a
price of one-half the current market price of that stock. This occurrence is
referred to as a

"flip-over event" under the plan. An acquiring person will not be entitled to
exercise its rights, which will have become void.

     Until ten days after the announcement that a person has become an acquiring
person, New Pride's board of directors may decide to redeem the rights at a
price of $.01 per right, payable in cash, shares of common stock or other
consideration. The rights will not be exercisable after a flip-in event until
the rights are no longer redeemable.

     At any time after a flip-in event and prior to either a person's becoming
the beneficial owner of 50% or more of the shares of common stock or a flip-over
event, New Pride's board of directors may decide to exchange the rights for
shares of common stock on a one-for-one basis. Rights owned by an acquiring
person, which will have become void, will not be exchanged.

     Other than provisions relating to the redemption price of the rights, the
rights agreement may be amended by New Pride's board of directors at any time
that the rights are redeemable. Thereafter, the provisions of the rights
agreement other than the redemption price may be amended by the board of
directors to cure any ambiguity, defect or inconsistency, to make changes that
do not materially adversely affect the interests of holders of rights (excluding
the interests of any acquiring person), or to shorten or lengthen any time
period under the rights agreement. No amendment to lengthen the time period for
redemption may be made if the rights are not redeemable at that time.

     The rights have certain anti-takeover effects. The rights will cause
substantial dilution to any person or group that attempts to acquire New Pride
without the approval of its board of directors. As a result, the overall effect
of the rights may be to render more difficult or discourage any attempt to
acquire New Pride even if the acquisition may be favorable to the interests of
New Pride's stockholders. Because the board of directors can redeem the rights
or approve a tender or exchange offer, the rights should not interfere with a
merger or other business combination approved by the board.

LIMITATION OF LIABILITY OF OFFICERS AND DIRECTORS

     New Pride's directors will not be personally liable to New Pride or its
stockholders for monetary damages for breach of fiduciary duty as a director,
except, if required by Delaware law, for liability:

     - for any breach of the duty of loyalty to New Pride or its stockholders;

     - for acts or omissions not in good faith or involving intentional
       misconduct or a knowing violation of law;

     - for unlawful payment of a dividend or unlawful stock purchases or
       redemptions; and

     - for any transaction from which the director derived an improper personal
       benefit.

     As a result, neither New Pride nor its stockholders have the right, through
stockholders' derivative suits on behalf of New Pride, to recover monetary
damages against a director for breach of fiduciary duty as a director, including
breaches resulting from grossly negligent behavior, except in the situations
described above.

DELAWARE ANTI-TAKEOVER LAW

     New Pride is a Delaware corporation and is subject to Section 203 of the
Delaware General Corporation Law, which regulates corporate acquisitions.
Section 203 prevents an "interested stockholder," which is defined generally as
a person owning 15% or more of a corporation's voting stock, or any affiliate or
associate of that person, from engaging in a broad range of "business
combinations" with the corporation for three years after becoming an interested
stockholder unless:

     - the board of directors of the corporation had previously approved either
       the business combination or the transaction that resulted in the
       stockholder's becoming an interested stockholder;

     - upon completion of the transaction that resulted in the stockholder's
       becoming an interested stockholder, that person owned at least 85% of the
       voting stock of the corporation outstanding at the time the transaction
       commenced, excluding shares owned by persons who are directors and also
       officers and shares owned in employee stock plans in which participants
       do not have the right to determine whether shares held subject to the
       plan will be tendered; or

     - following the transaction in which that person became an interested
       stockholder, the business combination is approved by the board of
       directors of the corporation and holders of at least two-thirds of the
       outstanding voting stock not owned by the interested stockholder.

     Under Section 203, the restrictions described above also do not apply to
specific business combinations proposed by an interested stockholder following
the announcement or notification of designated extraordinary transactions
involving the corporation and a person who had not been an interested
stockholder during the previous three years or who became an interested
stockholder with the approval of a majority of the corporation's directors, if
such extraordinary transaction is approved or not opposed by a majority of the
directors who were directors prior to any person becoming an interested
stockholder during the previous three years or were recommended for election or
elected to succeed such directors by a majority of such directors.

     Section 203 may make it more difficult for a person who would be an
interested stockholder to effect various business combinations with a
corporation for a three-year period.

TRANSFER AGENT AND REGISTRAR

     American Stock Transfer & Trust Company will be the transfer agent and
registrar for New Pride's common stock.

                      COMPARISON OF RIGHTS OF SHAREHOLDERS

     As a result of the mergers, Pride and Marine shareholders will become
holders of New Pride common stock. New Pride is a Delaware corporation, Pride is
a Louisiana corporation and Marine is a Texas corporation. The rights of Pride
shareholders are currently governed by the Pride articles of incorporation, the
Pride bylaws and the laws of Louisiana. The rights of Marine shareholders are
currently governed by the Marine articles of incorporation, the Marine bylaws
and the laws of Texas. Following the mergers, the rights of all former holders
of shares of Pride and Marine common stock will be governed by the New Pride
certificate of incorporation, the New Pride bylaws and the laws of Delaware.

     The following is a summary explanation of some of the material differences
between the rights of holders of New Pride, Pride and Marine common stock. These
differences arise in part from the differences between Delaware, Louisiana and
Texas law. Additional differences arise from the differences between charter
documents of the three companies. This summary is qualified by reference to the
charter documents of the three companies. New Pride's charter documents are
attached as Annex D and E. For information on how to obtain a copy of the
charter documents of Pride and Marine, see "Where You Can Find More Information"
beginning on page 91. In addition, the description of the differences between
Delaware, Louisiana and Texas law is a summary only, is not a complete
description of the differences between Delaware, Louisiana and Texas law and is
qualified by reference to Delaware, Louisiana and Texas law.

operations, shareholders' equity and cash flows for each of the years in the
period ended December 31, 2000, incorporated by reference in this joint proxy
statement/prospectus and elsewhere in this registration statement, have been
audited by KPMG LLP, independent certified public accountants, as set forth in
their report incorporated herein, and are incorporated herein in reliance upon
such report given on the authority of such firm as experts in auditing and
accounting.

                            INDEPENDENT ACCOUNTANTS

     With respect to the unaudited interim consolidated financial information of
Pride and Marine for the three-month periods ended March 31, 2001 and 2000,
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP and KPMG LLP, respectively, reported that they have
each applied limited procedures in accordance with professional standards for a
review of such information. However, their separate reports thereon incorporated
by reference state that they did not audit and they do not express an opinion on
that unaudited consolidated financial information. Accordingly, the degree of
reliance on their reports on such information should be restricted in light of
the limited nature of the review procedures applied. PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP
and KPMG LLP are not subject to the liability provisions of Section 11 of the
Securities Act of 1933 for their reports on the unaudited interim consolidated
financial information because neither of those reports is a "report" or a "part"
of the registration statement prepared or certified by PricewaterhouseCoopers
LLP or KPMG LLP within the meaning of Sections 7 and 11 of the Securities Act of
1933.

Time, by virtue of the Marine Merger, and without any further action by Marine,
Merger Sub or Pride or by the holders of any securities of Marine, Merger Sub or
Pride:

          (a) Cancellation of Treasury Stock and Pride Owned Stock.  Each share
     of Marine's common stock, par value $.01 per share (the "Marine Common
     Stock"), that is owned directly by Marine, by Pride or their respective
     subsidiaries immediately prior to the Marine Merger Effective Time shall
     automatically be canceled and retired and shall cease to exist, and no
     consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor.

          (b) Conversion of Marine Common Stock.  Each issued and outstanding
     share of Marine Common Stock (other than shares to be canceled in
     accordance with Section 4.1(a)) shall be converted into one fully paid and
     nonassessable share of Pride Common Stock (the "Marine Merger
     Consideration"). As of the Marine Merger Effective Time, all such shares of
     Marine Common Stock shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically
     be canceled and retired and shall cease to exist, and each holder of a
     certificate or certificates which immediately prior to the Marine Merger
     Effective Time represented outstanding shares of Marine Common Stock (the
     "Marine Certificates") shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto,
     except the right to receive the number of shares of Pride Common Stock into
     which such shares have been converted.

     SECTION 4.2  Effect on the Stock of Merger Sub.  As of the Marine Merger
Effective Time, each share of the common stock, par value $.01 per share, of

     SECTION 4.4  Effect on Pride Stock.  As of the Pride Merger Effective Time,
by virtue of the Pride Merger and without any action on the part of Pride or the
Company or the holders of any securities of Pride or the Company:

          (a) Cancellation of Treasury Stock and Marine Owned Stock.  Each share
     of Pride's common stock, no par value (the "Pride Common Stock"), that is
     owned directly by Pride, by Marine or by their respective subsidiaries
     immediately prior to the Pride Merger Effective Time shall automatically

                                       A-4

     shall be delivered in exchange therefor.

          (b) Conversion of Pride Common Stock.  Each issued and outstanding
     share of Pride Common Stock (including shares of Pride Common Stock issued
     in the Marine Merger but excluding shares of Pride Common Stock to be

     (the "Pride Exchange Ratio") fully paid and nonassessable share of Company

     Effective Time, all such shares of Pride Common Stock shall no longer be
     outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and retired and shall cease
     to exist, and each holder of a certificate or certificates or rights
     thereto that immediately prior to the Pride Merger Effective Time which
     represent outstanding shares of Pride Common Stock (the "Pride
     Certificates") shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except
     the right to receive certificates ("Company Certificates") representing the
     number of shares of Company Common stock into which such shares have been
     converted.

     SECTION 4.5  Exchange of Certificates.

     (a) Exchange Agent.  As of the Closing Date, the Company shall enter into
an agreement with American Stock Transfer & Trust Company (the "Exchange
Agent"), which shall provide that the Company shall deposit with the Exchange
Agent, for the benefit of the holders of Marine Common Stock and Pride Common
Stock, for exchange in accordance with this Article 4, through the Exchange
Agent, Company Certificates representing the number of shares of Company Common
Stock (such shares of Company Common Stock, together with any dividends or
distributions with respect thereto with a record date after the Pride Merger
Effective Time being hereinafter referred to as the "Exchange Fund") issuable
pursuant to this Article 4.

     (b) Exchange Procedures.  As soon as reasonably practicable after the Pride
Merger Effective Time, the Exchange Agent shall mail to each holder of record of
a Marine Certificate or a Pride Certificate (each a "Certificate" and
collectively the "Certificates") whose shares were converted pursuant to Section
4.1(b) and/or Section 4.4(b), (i) a letter of transmittal (which shall specify
that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates
shall pass, only upon delivery of the Certificates to the Exchange Agent and
shall be in such form and have such other provisions as Marine and Pride may
reasonably specify), and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of
the Certificates in exchange for the consideration set forth in Article 4. Upon
surrender of a Certificate for cancellation to the Exchange Agent, together with
such letter of transmittal, duly executed, and such other documents as may
reasonably be required by the Exchange Agent, the holder of such Certificate
shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor a Company Certificate
representing that number of shares of Company Common Stock which such holder has
the right to receive pursuant to the provisions of this Article 4, and the
Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be canceled. In the event of a
transfer of ownership of Marine Common Stock not registered in the transfer
records of Marine or of Pride Common Stock not registered in the transfer
records of Pride, a Company Certificate representing the proper number of shares
of Company Common Stock may be issued to a person other than the person in whose
name the Certificate so surrendered is registered if such Certificate shall be
properly endorsed or otherwise be in proper form for transfer and the person
requesting such issuance shall pay any transfer or other non-income taxes
required by reason of the issuance of shares of Company Common Stock to a person
other than the registered holder of such Certificate or establish to the
satisfaction of the Company that such tax has been paid or is not applicable.
Until surrendered as contemplated by this Section 4.5, each Certificate shall be
deemed at any time after the Pride Merger Effective Time to represent only the
right to receive upon such surrender Company Certificates representing the
number of shares of Company Common Stock into which the shares of Pride Common
Stock formerly represented by such Certificate (including shares of Pride Common
Stock issuable in respect of Marine Common Stock as a result of the Marine
Merger) have been converted. No interest will be paid or will accrue on any cash
payable to holders of Certificates pursuant to the provisions of this Article 4.

                                       A-5

     (c) Distributions with Respect to Unexchanged Shares.  No dividends or
other distributions with respect to Company Common Stock with a record date
after the Pride Merger Effective Time shall be paid to the holder of any
unsurrendered Certificate with respect to the shares of Company Common Stock
represented thereby and all such dividends and other distributions shall be paid
by the Company to the Exchange Agent and shall be included in the Exchange Fund,
in each case until the surrender of such Certificate in accordance with this
Article 4. Subject to the effect of applicable escheat or similar laws,
following surrender of any such Certificate there shall be paid to the holder of
the Company Certificate representing shares of Company Common Stock issued in
exchange therefor, without interest, (i) at the time of such surrender, the
amount of dividends or other distributions with a record date after the Pride
Merger Effective Time theretofore paid with respect to such shares of Company
Common Stock and (ii) at the appropriate payment date, the amount of dividends
or other distributions with a record date after the Pride Merger Effective Time
but prior to such surrender and with a payment date subsequent to such surrender
payable with respect to such shares of Company Common Stock. The Company shall
make available to the Exchange Agent cash for these purposes.

     (d) No Further Ownership Rights in Marine Common Stock and Pride Common
Stock.  All shares of Company Common Stock issued upon the surrender for
exchange of Certificates in accordance with the terms of this Article 4
(including any cash paid pursuant to this Article 4) shall be deemed to have
been issued (and paid) in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the
shares of Pride Common Stock (including shares of Pride Common Stock issuable in
respect of Marine Common Stock as a result of the Marine Merger) theretofore
represented by such Certificates, subject, however, to the Pride Merger
Surviving Entity's obligation to pay any dividends or make any other
distributions with a record date prior to the Pride Merger Effective Time which
may have been authorized or made by Marine on such shares of Marine Common Stock
or by Pride on such shares of Pride Common Stock, as the case may be, which
remain unpaid at the Pride Merger Effective Time.

     (e) Termination of Exchange Fund.  Any portion of the Exchange Fund which
remains undistributed to the holders of the Certificates for six months after
the Pride Merger Effective Time shall be delivered to the Company upon demand,
and any holders of the Certificates who have not theretofore complied with this
Article 4 shall thereafter look only to the Company for payment of their claim
for Pride Merger Consideration and any dividends or distributions with respect
to Company Common Stock.

     (f) No Liability.  None of the Company, Marine, Pride, Merger Sub or the
Exchange Agent shall be liable to any person in respect of any shares of Company
Common Stock (or dividends or distributions with respect thereto) or cash from
the Exchange Fund in each case delivered to a public official pursuant to any
applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar law. If any Certificate shall
not have been surrendered prior to seven years after the Pride Merger Effective
Time (or immediately prior to such earlier date on which any Pride Merger
Consideration, any cash payable to the holder of such Certificate pursuant to
this Article 4 or any dividends or distributions payable to the holder of such
Certificate would otherwise escheat to or become the property of any
governmental body or authority), any Pride Merger Consideration, cash, dividends
or distributions in respect of such Certificate shall, to the extent permitted
by applicable law, become the property of the Company, free and clear of all
claims or interest of any person previously entitled thereto.

     (g) Investment of Exchange Fund.  The Exchange Agent shall invest any cash
included in the Exchange Fund, as directed by the Company, on a daily basis. Any
interest and other income resulting from such investments shall be paid to the
Company; provided, however, that no such investment or loss shall affect the
amounts payable to any holder of a Certificate.

     (h) Exchanges by Affiliates.  Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to
the contrary, any Company Common Stock and Company Certificates therefor issued
to affiliates of Marine as a result of the Mergers shall be subject to the
restrictions on transfer described in Section 7.13 and Exhibits 7.13(a) and
7.13(b)(1), and such shares shall bear restrictive legends as described in
Exhibit 7.13(a)(1). Any Company Common Stock and Certificates therefor issued to
affiliates of Pride as a result of the Pride

                                       A-6

Merger shall be subject to the restrictions on transfer described in Section
7.13(b) and Exhibit 7.13(b)(2).

     (i) Lost Certificates.  If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or
destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the person claiming
such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by the
Company, the posting by such person of a bond in such reasonable amount as the
Company may direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it
with respect to such Certificate, the Exchange Agent will issue in exchange for
such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the Pride Merger Consideration and,
if applicable, any unpaid dividends and distributions on shares of Company
Common Stock deliverable in respect thereof, pursuant to this Agreement.

     SECTION 4.6  Rule 16b-3 Approval.  Each of the Company, Marine, Merger Sub
and Pride agree that their respective board of directors or the executive
compensation committee of their board of directors shall, at or prior to the
Marine Merger Effective Time, adopt resolutions specifically approving, for
purposes of Rule 16b-3 ("Rule 16b-3") of the United States Securities and
Exchange Commission (the "SEC") under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as
amended (the "Exchange Act"), the receipt, pursuant to this Agreement, of
Company Common Stock and of options to acquire Company Common Stock, by
executive officers or directors of each of Marine and Pride who become executive
officers or directors of the Company subject to Rule 16b-3.

                                   ARTICLE 5

                    REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF MARINE

     Except as set forth in the disclosure letter delivered to Pride by Marine
at or prior to the execution hereof (the "Marine Disclosure Letter"), Marine
represents and warrants to Pride and the Company the following:

     SECTION 5.1  Existence; Good Standing; Corporate Authority.  Marine is a
corporation duly incorporated, validly existing and in good standing under the
laws of Texas. Marine is duly qualified to do business and, to the extent such
concept or similar concept exists in the relevant jurisdiction, is in good
standing under the laws of any jurisdiction in which the character of the
properties owned or leased by it therein or in which the transaction of its
business makes such qualification necessary, except where the failure to be so
qualified does not and is not reasonably likely to have, individually or in the
aggregate, a Marine Material Adverse Effect (as defined in Section 10.9(c)).
Marine has all requisite corporate power and authority to own, operate and lease
its properties and to carry on its business as now conducted. The copies of
Marine's restated articles of incorporation and bylaws previously made available
to Pride are true and correct and contain all amendments as of the date hereof.

     SECTION 5.2  Authorization, Validity and Effect of Agreements.  Marine has
the requisite corporate power and authority to execute and deliver this
Agreement, the Pride Stock Option Agreement and all other agreements and
documents contemplated hereby and thereby to which it is a party. The
consummation by Marine of the transactions contemplated hereby and by the Pride
Stock Option Agreement have been duly authorized by all requisite corporate
action on behalf of Marine, other than the approvals referred to in Section
5.19. This Agreement and the Pride Stock Option Agreement constitute valid and
legally binding obligations of Marine, enforceable against Marine in accordance
with their respective terms, subject to applicable bankruptcy, insolvency,
reorganization, moratorium or other similar laws relating to creditors' rights
and general principles of equity. Marine has taken all action necessary to
render the restrictions set forth in Part 13 of the TBCA inapplicable to this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby. No other state takeover or
business combination statute applies to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement or the Pride Stock Option Agreement.

     SECTION 5.3  Capitalization.  As of the date of this Agreement, the
authorized capital stock of Marine consists of 200,000,000 shares of common
stock, par value $.01 per share, and 20,000,000 shares of preferred stock, par
value $.01 per share, of which 200,000 shares have been designated Junior
Participating Preferred Stock ("Junior Preferred Stock"). As of May 18, 2001,
58,697,281 shares of
                                       A-7

Marine Common Stock and no shares of Junior Preferred Stock were outstanding. At
the same date, there were 3,576,359 shares of Marine Common Stock reserved for
issuance upon exercise of outstanding Marine Stock Options (as defined in
Section 7.16). All such issued and outstanding shares of Marine Common Stock are
duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid, nonassessable and free of
preemptive rights. One right to purchase Junior Preferred Stock (each, a "Marine
Right") issued pursuant to the Rights Agreement, dated as of November 15, 1996
(the "Marine Rights Agreement"), as amended, between Marine and American Stock
Transfer & Trust Company is associated with and attached to each outstanding
share of Marine Common Stock. As of the date of this Agreement, except for the
Pride Stock Option Agreement, the Marine Rights and as set forth in this Section
5.3, there are no outstanding shares of capital stock and there are no options,
warrants, calls, subscriptions, convertible securities or other rights,
agreements or commitments which obligate Marine or any of its Subsidiaries to
issue, transfer or sell any shares of capital stock or other voting securities
of Marine or any of its Subsidiaries. Marine has no outstanding bonds,
debentures, notes or other obligations the holders of which have the right to
vote (or which are convertible into or exercisable for securities having the
right to vote) with the shareholders of Marine on any matter.

     SECTION 5.4  Significant Subsidiaries.  For purposes of this Agreement,
"Significant Subsidiary" shall mean significant subsidiary as defined in Rule
1-02 of Regulation S-X of the SEC under the Exchange Act. Each of Marine's
Significant Subsidiaries is a corporation or other legal entity duly organized,
validly existing and in good standing under the laws of its jurisdiction of
incorporation or organization, has the corporate power and authority to own,
operate and lease its properties and to carry on its business as it is now being
conducted, and is duly qualified to do business and is in good standing (where
applicable) in each jurisdiction in which the ownership, operation or lease of
its property or the conduct of its business requires such qualification, except
for jurisdictions in which such failure to be so qualified or to be in good
standing does not and is not reasonably likely to have a Marine Material Adverse
Effect. As of the date of this Agreement, all of the outstanding shares of
capital stock of, or other ownership interests in, each of Marine's Significant
Subsidiaries are duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable
and are owned, directly or indirectly, by Marine free and clear of all
mortgages, deeds of trust, liens, security interests, pledges, leases,
conditional sale contracts, charges, privileges, easements, rights of way,
reservations, options, rights of first refusal and other encumbrances ("Liens").

     SECTION 5.5  Compliance with Laws; Permits.  Except for such matters as,
individually or in the aggregate, do not or are not reasonably likely to have a
Marine Material Adverse Effect and except for matters arising under
Environmental Laws which are treated exclusively in Section 5.13:

          (a) Neither Marine nor any Subsidiary of Marine is in violation of any
     applicable law, rule, regulation, code, governmental determination, order,
     treaty, convention, governmental certification requirement or other public
     limitation, U.S. or non-U.S. (collectively, the "Marine Applicable Laws"),
     relating to the ownership or operation of any of their respective assets,
     and no claim is pending or, to the knowledge of Marine, threatened with
     respect to any such matters. No condition exists that is not disclosed in
     the Marine Disclosure Letter and which does or is reasonably likely to
     constitute a violation of or deficiency under any Marine Applicable Law
     relating to the ownership or operation of the assets of Marine or any
     Subsidiary of Marine.

          (b) Marine and each Subsidiary of Marine hold all permits, licenses,
     certifications, variations, exemptions, orders, franchises and approvals of
     all governmental or regulatory authorities necessary for the conduct of
     their respective businesses (the "Marine Permits"). All Marine Permits are
     in full force and effect and there exists no default thereunder or breach
     thereof, and Marine has no notice or actual knowledge that such Marine
     Permits will not be renewed in the ordinary course after the Marine Merger
     Effective Time. No governmental authority has given, or to the knowledge of
     Marine threatened to give, any action to terminate, cancel or reform any
     Marine Permit.

          (c) Each drilling rig or other drilling unit owned by Marine or a
     subsidiary of Marine which is subject to classification is in class
     according to the rules and regulations of the applicable classifying body
     and is duly and lawfully documented under the laws of its flag
     jurisdiction.

                                       A-8

          (d) Marine and each Subsidiary of Marine possess all permits,
     licenses, operating authorities, orders, exemptions, franchises, variances,
     consents, approvals or other authorizations required for the present
     ownership and operation of all its real property or leaseholds ("Marine
     Real Property") except where the failure to possess any of the same does
     not and is not reasonably likely to have a Marine Material Adverse Effect.

     SECTION 5.7  SEC Documents.  Marine has timely filed with the SEC all
documents required to be so filed by it in the preceding twelve months pursuant
to Sections 13(a), 14(a) and 15(d) of the Exchange Act. Marine and its

them in the preceding three fiscal years and during 2001 pursuant to Section
13(a) of the Exchange

                                       A-9

Act without regard to Rule 12b-25. Marine has made available to Pride each
registration statement, report, proxy statement or information statement (other
than preliminary materials) it has so filed, each in the form (including
exhibits and any amendments thereto) filed with the SEC (collectively, the
"Marine Reports"). As of its respective date, each Marine Report (i) complied in
all material respects in accordance with the applicable requirements of the
Exchange Act and the rules and regulations thereunder and (ii) did not contain
any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements made therein,
in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading
except for such statements, if any, as have been modified by subsequent filings
with the SEC prior to the date hereof. Each of the consolidated balance sheets
included in or incorporated by reference into Marine Reports (including the
related notes and schedules) fairly presents in all material respects the
consolidated financial position of Marine and its Subsidiaries as of its date,
and each of the consolidated statements of operations, cash flows and changes in
shareholders' equity included in or incorporated by reference into Marine
Reports (including any related notes and schedules) fairly presents in all
material respects the results of operations, cash flows or changes in
shareholders' equity, as the case may be, of Marine and its Subsidiaries for the
periods set forth therein (subject, in the case of unaudited statements, to (x)
such exceptions as may be permitted by Form 10-Q and Regulation S-X of the SEC
and (y) normal year-end audit adjustments), in each case in accordance with
generally accepted accounting principles consistently applied during the periods
involved, except as may be noted therein. Except as and to the extent set forth
on the most recent consolidated balance sheet of Marine and its Subsidiaries
included in Marine Reports, including all notes thereto, as of the date of such
balance sheet, neither Marine nor any of its Subsidiaries has any liabilities or
obligations of any nature (whether accrued, absolute, contingent or otherwise)
that would be required to be reflected on, or reserved against in, a balance
sheet of Marine or in the notes thereto prepared in accordance with generally
accepted accounting principles consistently applied, other than liabilities or
obligations which do not and are not reasonably likely to have, individually or
in the aggregate, a Marine Material Adverse Effect.

     SECTION 5.8  Litigation.   Except as would not have a Marine Material
Adverse Effect, Section 5.8 of the Marine Disclosure Letter contains an accurate
summary of each litigation matter pending or threatened against Marine or any of
its Subsidiaries that is not summarized in the Marine Reports. Except as
described in Marine Reports filed on or prior to the date of this Agreement,
there are no actions, suits or proceedings pending against Marine or any of its
Subsidiaries or, to Marine's knowledge, threatened against Marine or any of its
Subsidiaries, at law or in equity, before or by any U.S. federal, state or
non-U.S. court, commission, board, bureau, agency or instrumentality, that are
reasonably likely to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Marine Material
Adverse Effect.

     SECTION 5.9  Absence of Certain Changes.   From December 31, 2000 to the
date of this Agreement, there has not been (i) any event or occurrence that has
had or is reasonably likely to have a Marine Material Adverse Effect, (ii) any
material change by Marine or any of its Subsidiaries, when taken as a whole, in
any of its accounting methods, principles or practices or any of its tax
methods, practices or elections, (iii) any declaration, setting aside or payment
of any dividend or distribution in respect of any capital stock of Marine or any
redemption, purchase or other acquisition of any of its securities or (iv) any
increase in or establishment of any bonus, insurance, severance, deferred
compensation, pension, retirement, profit sharing, stock option, stock purchase
or other employee benefit plan, except in the ordinary course of business.

     SECTION 5.10  Taxes.   Except for such matters as, individually or in the
aggregate, do not or are not reasonably likely to have a Marine Material Adverse
Effect, and except as disclosed in the Marine Disclosure Letter (it being
understood that inclusion of a matter in the Marine Disclosure Letter does not
necessarily mean that such matter is or is reasonably likely to have a Marine
Material Adverse Effect):

          (a) Each of Marine and its Subsidiaries has filed all Tax Returns that
     it was required to file. All such Tax Returns were correct and complete in

     Subsidiaries currently is the beneficiary of any extension of time within

     Taxes required to have been withheld and paid in connection with amounts

          (c) No officer or employee responsible for Tax matters of any of
     Marine and its Subsidiaries expects any authority to assess any additional
     Taxes for any period for which Tax Returns have been filed. There is no
     dispute or claim concerning any Tax liability of any of Marine and its
     Subsidiaries either (i) claimed or raised by any authority in writing or
     (ii) as to which any of the officers or employees responsible for Tax
     matters of Marine and its Subsidiaries has knowledge based upon personal
     contact with any agent of such authority. Section 5.10 of the Marine
     Disclosure Letter lists all federal, state, local, and foreign income Tax
     Returns filed with respect to any of Marine and its Subsidiaries for
     taxable periods ended on or after December 31, 1998, indicates those Tax
     Returns that have been audited, and indicates those Tax Returns that
     currently are the subject of audit or have been noticed for audit.

     limitations in respect of Taxes or agreed to any extension of time with

     recognition agreement under U.S. Treasury Reg. Section 1.367(a)-8.

          (i) None of Marine and its Subsidiaries has paid, or is obligated to
     make any payments, in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
     Agreement that could reasonably be expected to be non deductible under Code
     Section 280G.

          (j) Marine has not been a United States real property holding
     corporation within the meaning of Code Section 897(c)(2) during the
     previous five years.

          (k) Marine has disclosed on its federal income Tax Returns all
     positions taken therein that could give rise to a substantial
     understatement of federal income Tax within the meaning of Code Section

     or (ii) has any liability for the Taxes of any Person (other than any of
     Marine and its Subsidiaries) under U.S. Treas. Reg. Section 1.1502-6 (or
     any similar provision of state, local, or foreign law), as a transferee or
     successor, by contract, or otherwise.

          (n) Section 5.10(n) of the Marine Disclosure Letter sets forth the
     following information with respect to each of Marine and its Subsidiaries
     as of the most recent practicable date (as well as on an estimated pro
     forma basis as of the Closing giving effect to the consummation of the
     transactions contemplated hereby) for both United States income tax
     purposes and foreign tax purposes where

                                       A-11

     applicable: (i) the amount of any net operating loss, net capital loss,
     unused investment or other credit, unused foreign tax, or excess charitable
     contribution allocable to Marine or Subsidiary; and (ii) the amount of any
     deferred gain or loss allocable to Marine or Subsidiary arising out of any
     Deferred Intercompany Transaction.

          (o) The unpaid Taxes of Marine and its Subsidiaries (i) did not, as of
     the date of the most recent balance sheet included in the most recent
     Marine Report containing historical financial statements, exceed the
     reserve for Tax liability (other than any reserve for deferred Taxes
     established to reflect timing differences between book and Tax income) set
     forth on the face of such most recent balance sheet (rather than in any
     notes thereto) and (ii) do not exceed that reserve as adjusted for the
     passage of time through the Closing Date in accordance with the past custom
     and practice of Marine and its Subsidiaries in filing their Tax Returns.

          (p) Neither Marine nor any of the Marine Subsidiaries knows of any
     fact, or has taken any action or has failed to take any action, that is
     reasonably likely to (i) prevent the Mergers from qualifying as
     reorganizations within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code, (ii)
     cause the holders who exchange Marine Common Stock solely for Pride Common
     Stock pursuant to the Marine Merger to recognize taxable gain with respect
     to the Marine Merger, (iii) cause the Pride shareholders, including the
     former holders of Marine Common Stock, who exchange Pride Common Stock
     solely for Company Common Stock pursuant to the Pride Merger to recognize
     taxable gain with respect to the Pride Merger, or (iv) cause income to be
     recognized or Tax to be accelerated or be due as a consequence of the
     Mergers. Neither Pride nor any of its Subsidiaries has agreed to pay, or
     will pay, directly or indirectly, any consideration for Marine Common Stock
     other than Pride Common Stock. Neither the Company nor any of its
     Subsidiaries has agreed to pay, or will pay, directly or indirectly, any
     consideration other than Company Common Stock for Pride Common Stock,
     including that issued in the Marine Merger.
