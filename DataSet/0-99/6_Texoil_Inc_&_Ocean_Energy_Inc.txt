                               SUMMARY TERM SHEET

     We, OEI Acquisition Corp., are a wholly-owned subsidiary of Ocean Energy,
Inc., and we are offering to acquire all the outstanding shares of common and
preferred stock of Texoil, Inc. The following are some questions you, as a
stockholder of Texoil, may have and answers to those questions. This summary
sheet is not meant as a substitute for the information contained in the
remainder of this offer to purchase and the related letters of transmittal, and
the information contained in the summary sheet is qualified in its entirety by
the more detailed descriptions and explanations contained in this offer to
purchase and the related letters of transmittal. We urge you to carefully read
the entire offer to purchase and the related letters of transmittal prior to
making any decision regarding whether to tender your shares.

WHO IS OFFERING TO BUY MY SHARES OF TEXOIL?

     We are OEI Acquisition Corp., a Nevada corporation. We are a wholly-owned
subsidiary of Ocean Energy, Inc. and we were formed for the purpose of making
this Offer. See Section 9 -- "Certain Information Concerning Parent and the
Offeror" and Schedule I.

HOW MANY SHARES ARE YOU SEEKING TO PURCHASE, AT WHAT PRICE, AND DO I HAVE TO PAY
ANY BROKERAGE OR SIMILAR FEES TO TENDER?

     We are offering to purchase (1) all the outstanding shares of common stock
of Texoil at a purchase price of $8.25 per share, net to you, in cash, without
interest, and (2) all the outstanding shares of Series A Convertible Preferred
Stock of Texoil at a purchase price of $18.04 per share, net to you, in cash,
without interest, upon the terms and subject to the conditions contained in this
offer to purchase and in the related letters of transmittal. Any shares acquired
in the offer will include all rights associated with such shares, including but
not limited to all cash and non-cash dividends, distributions, rights, other
shares or other securities issued, paid or distributed or issuable, payable or
distributable in respect thereof on or after the date of the merger agreement
among us, our parent and Texoil (including, without limitation, with respect to
the preferred shares, rights to certain dividends). If you tender your shares
directly to the depositary that we have hired to complete this transaction, you
will not have to pay any brokerage fees or any similar expenses. If you own your
shares through a broker or other nominee, and your broker or other nominee
tenders your shares for you, your broker or other nominee may charge you a fee.
You should check whether your broker or other nominee will charge you any fee to
tender your shares for you. See "Introduction" and Section 1 -- "Terms of the
Offer; Expiration Date; Extension of Tender Period; Termination; Amendment".

WHY ARE YOU MAKING THIS OFFER?

     We are making this offer because our parent Ocean Energy, Inc., a Texas
corporation, wants to acquire Texoil. If the offer is completed, we intend to
merge with and into Texoil, and Texoil will become a direct wholly-owned
subsidiary of Ocean Energy, Inc.

DO YOU HAVE THE FINANCIAL RESOURCES TO MAKE PAYMENT?

     Yes. We have the funds available to acquire the shares in the offer. See
Section 10 -- "Source and Amount of Funds".

IS YOUR FINANCIAL CONDITION RELEVANT TO MY DECISION ON WHETHER TO TENDER MY
SHARES IN THE OFFER?

     No. Since we are paying cash for your shares and the offer is not subject
to a financing condition, we do not think our financial condition is important
to your decision to tender your shares. See Section 10 -- "Source and Amount of
Funds".

HOW LONG DO I HAVE TO DECIDE WHETHER TO TENDER MY SHARES?

     You will have until at least 12:00 midnight, New York City time, on
Thursday, February 22, 2001, to tender your shares. Such date is the "Expiration
Date" for the offer. We have the right to extend the offer, without the consent
of Texoil if at the Expiration Date (or any extension of the Expiration Date)
any condition to the offer is not satisfied or waived. We also have agreed to
extend the offer from time to time until May 31, 2001 if at the then scheduled
Expiration Date all of the tender offer conditions have not been satisfied or
waived as permitted by the merger agreement. We will not be required to extend
the offer under this provision unless, in the reasonable judgment of Ocean
Energy, Inc., (i) each such condition is reasonably capable of being satisfied;
(ii) Texoil is in material compliance with all of its covenants in the merger
agreement; and (iii) the failure of such condition to be satisfied shall not
result from a breach by Texoil of any of its covenants and agreements contained
in the merger agreement. If we extend the time period of the offer, this will
extend the time that you will have to tender your shares.

     We may elect to provide a "subsequent offering period" for the offer. A
subsequent offering period, if one is included, will be an additional period of
time beginning after we have purchased shares tendered during the offer, during
which time stockholders may tender, but not withdraw, their shares and receive
the offer consideration. We do not currently intend to include a subsequent
offering period, although we reserve the right to do so. See Section 1 -- "Terms
of the Offer; Expiration Date; Extension of Tender Period; Termination;
Amendment".

HOW WILL I BE NOTIFIED IF THE OFFER IS EXTENDED?

     If the offer is extended, we will issue a press release announcing the
extension on or before 9:00 a.m. New York City time on the first business day
following the date the offer was scheduled to expire. See Section 1 -- "Terms of
the Offer; Expiration Date; Extension of Tender Period; Termination; Amendment"
and Section 3 -- "Procedure for Tendering Shares".

HOW DO I TENDER MY SHARES?

     To tender your shares, you must complete and sign the related letter of
transmittal, which we have enclosed with this offer to purchase, indicating that
you want to sell your shares to us. Then send the letter of transmittal along
with the certificates representing your shares to the depositary prior to the
expiration of the offer. If your common shares are held in street name by your
broker, dealer, bank, trust company or other nominee, such nominee can tender
your common shares through The Depository Trust Company. If you cannot deliver
all necessary documents to the depositary in time, you may be able to complete
and deliver to the depositary the enclosed notice of guaranteed delivery in lieu
of the missing documents, provided you are able to comply fully with its terms.
See Section 3 -- "Procedure for Tendering Shares".

IF I TENDER MY SHARES, WHEN WILL I GET PAID?

     If the conditions to the offer are satisfied and we complete the offer and
accept your shares for payment, you will receive payment for the shares you
tendered as promptly as practicable following the expiration of the offer.

IF I TENDER MY SHARES, CAN I CHANGE MY MIND?

     Yes. You can withdraw your shares at any time prior to the expiration of
the offer and, if we have not agreed to accept your shares for payment by March
24, 2001, you can withdraw your shares at any time thereafter until we accept
your shares for payment. The right to withdraw tendered shares will not apply to
any subsequent offering period, if one is included. In order to withdraw your
shares, you must send written notice of the withdrawal to the depositary before
the expiration of the offer. Be sure to specify the name of the registered
holder(s) of the shares, the name of the person who tendered the shares and the
number of shares that are being withdrawn. If you tendered your shares by giving
instructions to a broker or nominee, you must instruct your broker or nominee to
arrange for the withdrawal of your shares. See Section 4 -- "Withdrawal Rights".

WHAT DOES TEXOIL'S BOARD OF DIRECTORS THINK OF THE OFFER?

     Texoil's board of directors has approved the offer and has determined that
the offer is fair to you and in your best interests. Texoil's board of directors
recommends that stockholders accept the offer and tender their shares. See
Section 11 -- "Background of Offer; Past Contacts; Transactions or Negotiations
with the Company".

WILL THE OFFER BE FOLLOWED BY A MERGER?

     We and our parent have entered into a merger agreement with Texoil that
provides that if we acquire at least a majority of the common shares and a
majority of the preferred shares in the offer, we will be merged into Texoil as
soon as practicable after the acquisition and the satisfaction of certain other
conditions contained in the merger agreement. If we acquire at least a majority
of the common shares and a majority of the preferred shares, we will have
sufficient voting power to approve the merger without the approval of any other
Texoil stockholders.

IF I OBJECT TO THE PRICE BEING OFFERED, WILL I HAVE APPRAISAL RIGHTS?

     No. Appraisal rights are not available in the offer. However, if the
proposed merger between us and Texoil is completed, then you would have certain
rights under Nevada law to dissent and demand appraisal of, and payment in cash
of the fair value of, your shares. See Section 12 -- "Purpose of the Offer and
the Merger; Plans for the Company" and Section 15 -- "Certain Legal Matters".

WHAT ARE THE UNITED STATES FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSEQUENCES OF TENDERING MY
SHARES?

     Your sale of shares pursuant to this offer is a taxable event for United
States federal income tax purposes and in all likelihood for state and local
income tax purposes. To the extent that the proceeds that you receive from the
sale of your shares pursuant to this offer exceed your basis in the shares sold,
you may realize a capital gain. If your basis in the shares sold exceeds the
proceeds you received pursuant to the sale, you may realize a capital loss.
Because tax matters are complicated, we encourage you to contact your own tax
advisor to determine the particular tax consequences of our offer to you. See
Section 5 -- "Certain United States Federal Income Tax Considerations".

WHAT IS THE MARKET VALUE OF MY SHARES AS OF A RECENT DATE?

     On January 23, 2001, the last trading day before the commencement of this
offer, the common shares closed on the Nasdaq Small Cap Market at 8.16 per
share. On January 17, 2001, the last trading day before the public announcement
of our intention to purchase the shares, the common shares closed on the Nasdaq
Small Cap Market at $7.56 per share. The average closing price of the common
shares over the thirty trading days prior to January 17, 2001 was $7.15 per
share. Please obtain a recent quotation for your common shares prior to deciding
whether or not to tender. The preferred shares are not quoted on any exchange
and there is no established market for the preferred shares.

WHAT ARE THE MOST SIGNIFICANT CONDITIONS TO THE OFFER?

     The completion of this offer is most significantly conditioned upon us
purchasing at least a majority of the outstanding common shares determined on a
fully diluted basis (excluding for this purpose common shares issuable upon
conversion of the preferred shares) and at least a majority of the outstanding
preferred shares determined on a fully diluted basis. We call this condition the
"Minimum Condition." In addition, we are not obligated to purchase shares that
are validly tendered if, among other things, there is a material adverse change
affecting the business of Texoil. The offer is also subject to certain other
conditions. See Section 14 -- "Certain Conditions to Our Obligations".

HAVE ANY STOCKHOLDERS AGREED TO TENDER THEIR SHARES?

     Yes. We have entered into agreements with certain stockholders who own in
the aggregate 54.8% of the common shares and 100% of the preferred shares
outstanding as of January 18, 2001. These shares represent as of such date 45.9%
of the common shares on a fully diluted basis (excluding for this purpose common
shares issuable upon conversion of preferred shares) and 100% of the preferred
shares on a fully diluted basis. These stockholders also own, as of such date,
options and warrants exercisable for common shares representing approximately
12.5% of the common shares on a fully diluted basis (excluding for this purpose
common shares issuable upon conversion of preferred shares). These stockholders
have agreed, subject to the terms of those agreements, to tender in the offer
all shares that they currently own as well as any shares they may subsequently
acquire, including upon any exercise of options or warrants. See the
"Introduction" to this offer to purchase and Section 13 -- "The Merger
Agreement, the Tender and Voting Agreement, the Tender Agreement and the
Confidentiality Agreements."

IF SUFFICIENT SHARES TO SATISFY THE MINIMUM CONDITION ARE TENDERED AND ACCEPTED
FOR PAYMENT, WILL TEXOIL CONTINUE AS A PUBLIC COMPANY?

     Yes. However, if and when the merger takes place, Texoil will no longer be
publicly owned. It is possible that, following the purchase of shares pursuant
to the offer and prior to the merger, there may be so few remaining stockholders
and publicly held common shares that the common shares will no longer be
eligible to be traded on the Nasdaq Small Cap Market or any other securities
exchange, there may not be an active public trading market (or, possibly, any
public trading market) for the common shares and Texoil may cease making filings
with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission or otherwise cease
being required to comply with its rules relating to publicly held companies.

IF I DECIDE NOT TO TENDER MY SHARES, HOW WILL THE OFFER AFFECT MY SHARES?

     As indicated above, if the offer is successful, we expect to complete a
merger transaction in which all stockholders not tendering in the offer will
receive (i) for each common share they hold, $8.25 in cash, without interest,
and (ii) for each preferred share they hold, $18.04 in cash, without interest,
subject to their appraisal rights as described above.

WHO CAN I TALK TO IF I HAVE QUESTIONS ABOUT THE OFFER?

     If you have any questions about the offer, you can call Georgeson
Shareholder Communications Inc., the information agent for the offer, at (800)
223-2064 (toll free).

To the Holders of Common Stock, par value $.01 per share, and
Series A Convertible Preferred Stock, par value $.01 per share,
of Texoil, Inc.:

                                  INTRODUCTION

     We, OEI Acquisition Corp., a Nevada corporation (the "Offeror") and a
direct wholly-owned subsidiary of Ocean Energy, Inc., a Texas corporation
("Parent"), hereby offer to purchase (i) all the outstanding shares of common
stock, par value $.01 per share (the "Common Shares") of Texoil, Inc., a Nevada
corporation (the "Company"), at a purchase price of $8.25 per share, net to you,
in cash, without interest (such price referred to herein as the "Common Share
Offer Price"), and (ii) all the outstanding shares of Series A Convertible
Preferred Stock, par value $.01 per share (the "Preferred Shares," and, together
with the Common Shares, the "Shares"), of the Company at a purchase price of
$18.04 per share, net to you, in cash, without interest (such price referred to
herein as the "Preferred Share Offer Price"), upon the terms and subject to the
conditions set forth in this Offer to Purchase and in the related Letters of
Transmittal (which, together with this Offer to Purchase and any amendments or
supplements hereto or thereto, collectively constitute the "Offer"). If you hold
your Shares directly, you will not be obligated to pay brokerage fees or
commissions or, except as set forth in the Letter of Transmittal, transfer taxes
on the purchase of Shares pursuant to the Offer. If you hold your Shares through
a broker, dealer, bank, trust company or other nominee, you should check with
such broker, dealer, bank, trust company or other nominee as to whether they
charge any service fees. We will pay all charges and expenses of EquiServe Trust
Company, N.A., which is acting as depositary for the Offer (the "Depositary")
and Georgeson Shareholder Communications Inc., which is acting as information
agent for the Offer (the "Information Agent"), incurred in connection with the
Offer. See Section 16 -- "Fees and Expenses".

     The Board of Directors of the Company has approved the Offer, the Merger
(as defined below) and the Merger Agreement (as defined below), has determined
that the Offer and the Merger are fair to, and in the best interests of, each
class of the Company's stockholders, and recommends that the Company's
stockholders accept the Offer and tender their Shares pursuant to the Offer.

     The Offer is conditioned upon, among other things, there being validly
tendered by the Expiration Date (as defined below) and not withdrawn (a) at
least that number of Common Shares which would constitute a majority of the
total number of outstanding Common Shares on a fully diluted basis on the date
of purchase, and (b) at least that number of Preferred Shares which would
constitute a majority of the total number of outstanding Preferred Shares on a
fully diluted basis on the date of purchase (clauses (a) and (b) together, the
"Minimum Condition"). The Offer is also conditioned upon the satisfaction of
other terms and conditions. See Section 14 -- "Certain Conditions to Our
Obligations." As used in this Offer to Purchase, "fully diluted" means in
reference to the Common Shares, all outstanding Common Shares on a fully diluted
basis, after giving effect to the exercise and conversion of all outstanding
options (including the Company Options (as hereinafter defined), whether or not
currently exercisable), warrants and securities exercisable for or convertible
(but excluding Preferred Shares) into Common Shares. When used in reference to
the Preferred Shares, "fully diluted" means all outstanding Preferred Shares on
a fully diluted basis, after giving effect to the exercise and conversion of any
outstanding options, warrants and securities exercisable for or convertible into
Preferred Shares.

     The Company has represented to us in the Merger Agreement that its Board of
Directors has received the opinion of Dain Rauscher Wessels, a division of Dain
Rauscher Incorporated, dated as of January 17, 2001, to the effect that, as of
the date of such opinion, the consideration to be received by the holders of
Common Shares and Preferred Shares was fair from a financial point of view to
such holders. A copy of such opinion is contained in the Company's Statement on
Schedule 14D-9, which the Company is distributing to its stockholders.

     The Offer is being made pursuant to the Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated
as of January 18, 2001 (the "Merger Agreement"), by and among Parent, us and the
Company. The Merger Agreement provides that, among other things, as soon as
practicable after the purchase of Shares pursuant to the

Offer and the satisfaction of the other conditions set forth in the Merger
Agreement and in accordance with the relevant provisions of the Nevada Revised
Statutes, we will be merged with and into the Company (the "Merger"). See
Section 12 -- "Purpose of the Offer and the Merger; Plans for the Company."
Following consummation of the Merger, the Company will continue as the surviving
corporation (the "Surviving Corporation") and will be a wholly-owned subsidiary
of Parent. At the effective time of the Merger (the "Effective Time"), each
Common Share and Preferred Share that is issued and outstanding (other than
Shares owned by the Company as treasury stock, any Shares owned by us, Parent,
or any other wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent, which shall be cancelled, and
Shares held by stockholders who have properly exercised appraisal rights under
the Nevada Revised Statutes, if any), will be converted into the right to
receive the Common Share Offer Price (or any higher price paid for Common Shares
pursuant to the Offer) and Preferred Share Offer Price (or any higher price paid
for Preferred Shares pursuant to the Offer), respectively, without interest,
upon surrender of the certificates formerly representing such Shares. See
Section 5 -- "Certain United States Federal Income Tax Considerations" for a
description of certain tax consequences of the Offer and the Merger. See Section
13 -- "The Merger Agreement, the Tender and Voting Agreement, the Tender
Agreement and the Confidentiality Agreements".

     The Merger Agreement provides that, promptly upon the payment by us for the
Shares pursuant to the Offer (provided that as a result thereof we own a
majority of the Common Shares and a majority of the Preferred Shares) and from
time to time thereafter, we will be entitled to designate (i) such number of
Class A directors, rounded up to the next whole number, on the Board of
Directors of the Company as is equal to the product of the total number of Class
A directors on the Board of Directors of the Company (determined after giving
effect to the directors elected pursuant to this provision) multiplied by the
percentage that the aggregate number of Shares beneficially owned by Parent, us
and any other affiliates of Parent (calculated on an as converted basis) bears
to the total number of Shares then outstanding (calculated on an as converted
basis), and (ii) such number of Class B directors, rounded up to the next whole
number, on the Board of Directors of the Company as is equal to the product of
the total number of Class B directors on the Board of Directors of the Company
(determined after giving effect to the directors elected pursuant to this
sentence) multiplied by the percentage that the aggregate number of Preferred
Shares beneficially owned by Parent, us and any other affiliates of Parent bears
to the total number of Preferred Shares then outstanding. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, until the Effective Time, the Company will have on its Board of
Directors at least two members who were directors of the Company on the date of
the Merger Agreement and not employees of the Company (such members, the
"Independent Directors"), provided, however, that if no Independent Directors
remain, the other directors shall designate one person to fill one of the
vacancies who shall be neither an employee of the Company nor an affiliate of
Parent and such person shall be deemed to be an Independent Director for
purposes of the Merger Agreement.

     The Company has advised us that as of January 18, 2001, there were (i)
25,000,000 authorized shares of Common Stock, par value $.01 per share, of which
6,724,939 shares were issued and outstanding, (ii) 10,000,000 authorized shares
of Class B Common Stock, par value $.01 per share, of which no shares were
issued and outstanding, (iii) 10,000,000 authorized shares of Preferred Stock,
of which 5,000,000 shares were authorized as Series A Convertible Preferred
Stock, par value $.01 per share, of which 2,991,465 shares were issued and
outstanding, (iv) outstanding stock options ("Company Options") under the
Company's 1994 Stock Option Plan and certain predecessor stock option plans
(collectively, the "Company Option Plans") for not in excess of 751,165 Common
Shares, and (v) 547,796 Common Shares reserved for issuance upon exercise of
certain warrants ("Company Warrants") to purchase Common Shares. We, together
with Parent, have entered into a Tender and Voting Agreement, dated as of
January 18, 2001, with the stockholders of the Company identified therein (such
stockholders, together with the stockholders party to the Tender Agreement
discussed below, being referred to herein as the "Selling Stockholders")
beneficially owning an aggregate of 3,386,796 outstanding Common Shares and
2,801,055 outstanding Preferred Shares (representing approximately 42.2% of the
Common Shares and 93.6% of the Preferred Shares outstanding on January 18, 2001,
on a fully diluted basis). Such Selling Stockholders also own, as of such date,
Company Options and Company Warrants exercisable for an

aggregate of 757,529 Common Shares. Pursuant to the Tender and Voting Agreement,
each such Selling Stockholder has agreed, among other things, (i) to validly
tender in the Offer all of such Selling Stockholder's Shares now owned or which
may hereafter be acquired by such Selling Stockholder (including pursuant to the
exercise of Company Warrants and Company Options), (ii) to appoint Parent as
such Selling Stockholder's proxy under certain circumstances to vote such
Selling Stockholder's Shares in connection with the Merger Agreement, (iii) with
respect to certain questions put to stockholders of the Company for a vote, to
vote such Selling Stockholder's Shares, in each case, in accordance with the
terms and conditions of the Tender and Voting Agreement and (iv) to restrict
transfers or exercises of Company Options and Company Warrants, if any, held by
such Selling Stockholder except as provided in the Tender and Voting Agreement.
In addition, each holder of Preferred Shares agreed that it would not (A) elect,
under Section 3(C) of the Designation of Preferences, Limitations and Rights of
Series A Convertible Preferred Stock of the Company (the "Designation"), to have
the Offer or Merger or any of the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby
treated as a Liquidation (as defined in the Designation) or (B) convert any
Preferred Share held by such Stockholder into any other series or class of
securities of the Company. We, together with Parent, have also entered into a
Tender Agreement, dated as of January 18, 2001, with the Selling Stockholders of
the Company identified therein. Such Selling Stockholders of the Company
identified in the Tender Agreement beneficially own an aggregate of 300,779
outstanding Common Shares and 190,460 outstanding Preferred Shares (representing
approximately 3.7% of the Common Shares and 6.4% of the Preferred Shares
outstanding on January 18, 2001, on a fully diluted basis). Such Selling
Stockholders also own as of such date Company Options exercisable for an
aggregate of 242,200 Common Shares. The provisions of the Tender Agreement are
substantially similar to the terms and conditions of the Tender and Voting
Agreement, except that the stockholders party to the Tender Agreement make no
representations or agreements regarding the voting of, or the granting of an
irrevocable proxy in connection with the voting of, the Tender Shares in favor
of the Offer, the Merger and other transactions. As of the date hereof, neither
we nor Parent beneficially own any Shares. If we acquire at least a majority of
each class of the outstanding Common Shares and Preferred Shares on a fully
diluted basis in the Offer, the Minimum Condition will be satisfied, and we
would have sufficient voting power to approve the Merger without the affirmative
vote of any other stockholder. Based on the information provided to us by the
Company as of January 18, 2001, the Minimum Condition will be satisfied if
4,011,951 Common Shares and 1,495,733 Preferred Shares are validly tendered and
not withdrawn prior to the expiration of the Offer. Accordingly, based on the
foregoing, if the Selling Stockholders validly tender and do not withdraw all
Shares that they currently own pursuant to the Tender Agreement and the Tender
and Voting Agreement, then clause (B) of the Minimum Condition (which relates to
the Preferred Shares) will be satisfied, and clause (A) of the Minimum Condition
(which relates to the Common Shares) will be satisfied if 324,376 additional
Common Shares are tendered and not withdrawn prior to the expiration of the
Offer.

     THE OFFER DOES NOT CONSTITUTE A SOLICITATION OF PROXIES FOR ANY MEETING OF
STOCKHOLDERS OF THE COMPANY. ANY SUCH SOLICITATION WILL BE MADE ONLY PURSUANT TO
SEPARATE PROXY MATERIALS PURSUANT TO THE REQUIREMENTS OF THE SECURITIES EXCHANGE
ACT OF 1934, AS AMENDED (THE "EXCHANGE ACT").

     THIS OFFER TO PURCHASE AND THE RELATED LETTER OF TRANSMITTAL CONTAIN
IMPORTANT INFORMATION. YOU SHOULD READ BOTH DOCUMENTS CAREFULLY IN THEIR
ENTIRETY BEFORE YOU MAKE A DECISION WITH RESPECT TO THE OFFER.

                                   THE OFFER

     1. TERMS OF THE OFFER; EXPIRATION DATE; EXTENSION OF TENDER PERIOD;
TERMINATION; AMENDMENT. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions of the
Offer (including, if the Offer is extended or amended, the terms and conditions
of any extension or amendment), we will accept for payment and pay for all
Shares validly tendered prior to the Expiration Date and not theretofore
properly withdrawn in accordance with Section 4 -- "Withdrawal Rights." The term
"Expiration Date" means 12:00 midnight, New York City time, on Thursday,
February 22, 2001, unless we shall have extended the period of time for which
the Offer is open, in which event the term "Expiration Date" shall mean the
latest time and date at which the Offer, as so extended by us, shall expire.

     The Offer is conditioned upon satisfaction of the Minimum Condition. If the
Minimum Condition or any of the other conditions referred to in Section
14 -- "Certain Conditions to Our Obligations" are not satisfied or any of the
events specified in Section 14 -- "Certain Conditions to Our Obligations" have
occurred or are determined by us to have occurred prior to the Expiration Date,
then we, subject to the terms of the Merger Agreement, expressly reserve the
right to (i) decline to purchase any of the Shares tendered in the Offer and
terminate the Offer, and return all tendered Shares to the tendering
stockholders, (ii) waive or amend any or all conditions to the Offer and, to the
extent permitted by the Merger Agreement and applicable law and applicable rules
and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "Commission"),
purchase all Shares validly tendered or (iii) subject to the limitations
described below, extend the Offer and, subject to the right of a tendering
stockholder to withdraw its Shares until the Expiration Date, retain the Shares
which have been tendered during the period or periods for which the Offer is
extended; provided, however, that the Minimum Condition may not be waived by us
without the Company's prior written consent.

     Under the terms of the Merger Agreement, we have the right, in our sole
discretion, to modify or make changes to the terms and conditions of the Offer,
provided, however, that without the prior written consent of the Company, we
shall not amend or waive the Minimum Condition, decrease the Common Share Offer
Price or the Preferred Share Offer Price, decrease the number of Shares sought,
change the form of consideration to be paid pursuant to the Offer, impose
conditions to the Offer in addition to those set forth in Section 14 -- "Certain
Conditions to Our Obligations" or amend any other term of the Offer in any
manner materially adverse to the holders of the Shares or reduce the time period
during which the Offer shall remain open. Subject to the terms of the Offer and
the Merger Agreement and the satisfaction or waiver of all the conditions to the
Offer as of any Expiration Date, we will accept for payment and pay for all
Shares validly tendered and not withdrawn pursuant to the Offer as soon as
practicable after the Expiration Date of the Offer. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, we shall be entitled to extend the Offer, without the consent of the
Company if at the initial Expiration Date, or any extension thereof, any
condition to the Offer is not satisfied or waived, and we agree to extend the
Offer from time to time until May 31, 2001 if at the then scheduled Expiration
Date all of the conditions to the Offer have not been satisfied or waived as
permitted by the Merger Agreement; provided, however, that we shall not be
required to extend the Offer as provided in this sentence unless, in Parent's
reasonable judgment, (i) each such condition is reasonably capable of being
satisfied; (ii) the Company is in material compliance with all of its covenants
in the Merger Agreement; and (iii) the failure of such condition to be satisfied
shall not result from a breach by the Company of any of its covenants and
agreements contained in the Merger Agreement. Any extension of the Offer shall
not, without the written consent of the Company, exceed the number of days that
we reasonably believe will be necessary so that the conditions will be
satisfied. In addition, we may, without the consent of the Company, extend any
then scheduled Expiration Date of the Offer for any period required by
applicable rules, regulations, interpretations or positions of the Commission or
the staff thereof applicable to the Offer or for any period required by
applicable law. We may also provide for a subsequent offering period (as
described below). In addition, the Common Share Offer Price and the Preferred
Share Offer Price may be increased and the Offer may be extended to the extent
required by law in connection with such increase, in each case without the
consent of the Company.

     Subject to the applicable rules and regulations of the Commission and
subject to the limitations set forth in the Merger Agreement, we also expressly
reserve the right, at any time and from time to time,

(i) to extend the period of time during which the Offer is open and thereby
delay payment for any Shares, regardless of whether such Shares were theretofore
accepted for payment, or to terminate the Offer and not to accept for payment or
pay for any Shares not theretofore accepted for payment or paid for, upon the
occurrence of any of the conditions set forth in Section 14 -- "Certain
Conditions to Our Obligations," by giving written notice of such delay or
termination to the Depositary, and (ii) at any time or from time to time, to
amend the Offer in any respect, although as discussed above certain amendments
require the written consent of the Company. Our right to delay payment for any
Shares or not to pay for any Shares theretofore accepted for payment is subject
to the applicable rules and regulations of the Commission, including Rule
l4e-l(c) under the Exchange Act, relating to our obligation to pay for or return
tendered Shares promptly after the termination or withdrawal of the Offer. Under
no circumstances will interest be paid on the purchase price for tendered
Shares, whether or not we exercise our right to extend the Offer. There can be
no assurance that we will exercise our right to extend the Offer.

     Any extension of the period during which the Offer is open, delay in
acceptance for payment or termination or any amendment of the Offer will be
followed, as promptly as practicable, by public announcement thereof, such
announcement, in the case of an extension, to be issued not later than 9:00
a.m., New York City time, on the next business day after the previously
scheduled Expiration Date in accordance with the public announcement
requirements of Rules 14d-4(c) and 14e-l(d) under the Exchange Act. Without
limiting our obligations and the obligations of Parent under such rules or the
manner in which we may choose to make any public announcement, we currently
intend to make announcements by issuing a press release to the Dow Jones News
Service and making any appropriate filing with the Commission.

     If, subject to the terms of the Merger Agreement, we make a material change
in the terms of the Offer or the information concerning the Offer, or if we
waive a material condition of the Offer, we will disseminate additional tender
offer materials and extend the Offer if and to the extent required by Rules
14d-4(c), 14d-6(d) and 14e-1 under the Exchange Act or otherwise. The minimum
period during which a tender offer must remain open following material changes
in the terms of the Offer or the information concerning the Offer, other than a
change in price or a change in percentage of securities sought, will depend upon
the facts and circumstances, including the relative materiality of the terms or
information changed. With respect to a change in price or a change in percentage
of securities sought, a minimum period of ten business days is generally
required to allow for adequate dissemination to stockholders and investor
response.

     Pursuant to the Merger Agreement and Rule 14d-11 under the Exchange Act,
and subject to certain conditions, we may elect to make available a subsequent
offering period by extending the Offer for up to 20 business days (the
"Subsequent Offering Period") if, on the Expiration Date, the Shares tendered
and not withdrawn pursuant to the Offer plus any shares we already own equal
less than ninety percent (90%) of the outstanding Shares on a fully diluted
basis. In order to extend the Offer in this way, the Minimum Condition must have
been satisfied and all other conditions to the Offer must have been satisfied or
waived. Under the Exchange Act, no withdrawal rights may apply to Shares
tendered during the Subsequent Offering Period, and no withdrawal rights may
apply during the Subsequent Offering Period with respect to Shares previously
tendered and accepted for payment in the Offer. If a Subsequent Offering Period
is commenced, we will promptly purchase and pay for any Shares tendered at the
same per share price paid in the Offer. We do not currently intend to provide a
Subsequent Offering Period, although we reserve the right to do so.

     The Company has provided us with the Company's list of stockholders and
security position listings for the purpose of disseminating the Offer to holders
of Shares. This Offer to Purchase and the related Letter of Transmittal will be
mailed to record holders of Shares whose names appear on the Company's
stockholder list and will be furnished to brokers, dealers, commercial banks,
trust companies and similar persons whose names, or the names of whose nominees,
appear on the stockholder list or, if applicable, who are listed as participants
in a clearing agency's security position listing for subsequent transmittal to
beneficial owners of Shares.

     2. ACCEPTANCE FOR PAYMENT AND PAYMENT FOR SHARES.  Upon the terms and
subject to the conditions of the Offer (including, if the Offer is extended or
amended, the terms and conditions of any such extension or amendment), we will
accept for payment and will pay for all Shares validly tendered prior to the
Expiration Date and not theretofore withdrawn in accordance with Section
4 -- "Withdrawal Rights" promptly after the later to occur of (a) the Expiration
Date and (b) subject to compliance with Rule 14e-l(c) under the Exchange Act,
the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth in Section 14 -- "Certain
Conditions to Our Obligations." Subject to compliance with Rule 14e-l(c) under
the Exchange Act, we expressly reserve the right to delay payment for Shares in
order to comply in whole or in part with any applicable law. See Section
1 -- "Terms of the Offer; Expiration Date; Extension of Tender Period;
Termination; Amendment" and Section 15 -- "Certain Legal Matters." In all cases,
payment for Shares tendered and accepted for payment pursuant to the Offer will
be made only after timely receipt by the Depositary of (i) certificates for such
Shares, or in the case of Common Shares, timely confirmation (a "Book-Entry
Confirmation") of a book-entry transfer of such Common Shares into the
Depositary's account at The Depository Trust Company (the "Book-Entry Transfer
Facility"), pursuant to the procedures set forth in Section 3 -- "Procedure for
Tendering Shares," (ii) a properly completed and duly executed Letter of
Transmittal (or a manually signed facsimile thereof) with all required signature
guarantees or, in the case of a book-entry transfer of Common Shares, an Agent's
Message (as defined below) and (iii) any other documents required by the Letter
of Transmittal.

     The term "Agent's Message" means a message transmitted by the Book-Entry
Transfer Facility to, and received by, the Depositary and forming a part of a
Book-Entry Confirmation, which states that the Book-Entry Transfer Facility has
received an express acknowledgment from the participant in the Book-Entry
Transfer Facility tendering the Common Shares that such participant has received
and agrees to be bound by the terms of the Letter of Transmittal and that we may
enforce such agreement against the participant.

     For purposes of the Offer, we will be deemed to have accepted for payment,
and thereby to have purchased, Shares validly tendered and not withdrawn as, if
and when we give written notice to the Depositary of our acceptance of such
Shares for payment. In all cases, payment for Shares purchased pursuant to the
Offer will be made by deposit of the purchase price with the Depositary, which
will act as agent for tendering stockholders for the purpose of receiving
payment from us and transmitting such payment to tendering stockholders. If, for
any reason whatsoever, acceptance for payment of any Shares tendered pursuant to
the Offer is delayed, or we are unable to accept for payment Shares tendered
pursuant to the Offer, then, without prejudice to our rights under Section
1 -- "Terms of the Offer; Expiration Date; Extension of Tender Period;
Termination; Amendment," the Depositary may, nevertheless, on behalf of the
Offeror, retain tendered Shares, and such Shares may not be withdrawn, except to
the extent that the tendering stockholders are entitled to withdrawal rights as
described in Section 4 -- "Withdrawal Rights" and as otherwise required by Rule
14e-l(c) under the Exchange Act. Under no circumstances will we pay interest on
the purchase price for tendered Shares because of any delay in making such
payment.

     If any tendered Shares are not accepted for payment pursuant to the terms
and conditions of the Offer for any reason, or if certificates are submitted for
more Shares than are tendered, certificates for such unpurchased or untendered
Shares will be returned, without expense, to the tendering stockholder (or, in
the case of Common Shares delivered by book-entry transfer to the Depositary's
account at the Book-Entry Transfer Facility, such Common Shares will be credited
to an account maintained with the Book-Entry Transfer Facility), as promptly as
practicable after the expiration, termination or withdrawal of the Offer.

     If, prior to the Expiration Date, we increase the price being paid for
Common Shares accepted for payment pursuant to the Offer, we will pay such
increased consideration for all Common Shares purchased pursuant to the Offer,
whether or not such Common Shares were tendered prior to such increase in
consideration. Similarly, if, prior to the Expiration Date, we increase the
price being paid for Preferred Shares accepted for payment pursuant to the
Offer, we will pay such increased consideration for all

Preferred Shares purchased pursuant to the Offer, whether or not such Preferred
Shares were tendered prior to such increase in consideration.

     3. PROCEDURE FOR TENDERING SHARES. Valid Tenders.  To tender Shares
pursuant to the Offer, a stockholder must comply with one of the following: (a)
a properly completed and duly executed Letter of Transmittal (or a facsimile
thereof) in accordance with the instructions of the Letter of Transmittal, with
any required signature guarantees, certificates for the Shares to be tendered
and any other documents required by the Letter of Transmittal must be received
by the Depositary at one of its addresses set forth on the back cover of this
Offer to Purchase prior to the Expiration Date, (b) in the case of Common
Shares, such Common Shares must be properly delivered pursuant to the procedures
for book-entry transfer, as described below, and a confirmation of such delivery
received by the Depositary, which confirmation must include an Agent's Message
if the tendering stockholder has not delivered a Letter of Transmittal, prior to
the Expiration Date, or (c) the tendering stockholder must comply with the
guaranteed delivery procedures set forth below. No alternative, conditional or
contingent tenders will be accepted. Delivery of documents to the Book-Entry
Transfer Facility in accordance with the Book-Entry Transfer Facility's
procedures does not constitute delivery to the Depositary.

     Book-Entry Transfer.  The Depositary will make a request to establish an
account with respect to the Common Shares at the Book-Entry Transfer Facility
for purposes of the Offer within two Business Days after the date of this Offer
to Purchase. Any financial institution that is a participant in the Book-Entry
Transfer Facility's system may make book-entry delivery of Common Shares by
causing the Book-Entry Transfer Facility to transfer such Common Shares into the
Depositary's account at the Book-Entry Transfer Facility in accordance with the
Book-Entry Transfer Facility's procedures for transfer. Although delivery of
Common Shares may be effected through book-entry at the Book-Entry Transfer
Facility prior to the Expiration Date, (i) the Letter of Transmittal (or a
manually signed facsimile thereof), properly completed and duly executed, with
any required signature guarantees, or an Agent's Message in connection with a
book-entry transfer, and any other documents required by the Letter of
Transmittal, must, in any case, be transmitted to and received by the Depositary
at the address set forth on the back cover of this Offer to Purchase or (ii) the
guaranteed delivery procedures described below must be complied with.

     Signature Guarantee.  Signatures on the Letter of Transmittal must be
guaranteed by a financial institution (including most commercial banks, savings
and loan associations and brokerage houses) which is a member in good standing
of the Securities Transfer Agents Medallion Program, The New York Stock Exchange
Medallion Signature Guarantee Program or the Stock Exchange Medallion Program
(an "Eligible Institution" and collectively "Eligible Institutions"), unless the
Shares tendered thereby are tendered (i) by a registered holder of Shares who
has not completed either the box labeled "Special Delivery Instructions" or the
box labeled "Special Payment Instructions" on the Letter of Transmittal or (ii)
for the account of any Eligible Institution. If the certificates evidencing
Shares are registered in the name of a person or persons other than the signer
of the Letter of Transmittal, or if payment is to be made, or delivered to, or
certificates for unpurchased Shares are to be issued or returned to, a person
other than the registered owner or owners of such Shares, then the tendered
certificates must be endorsed or accompanied by duly executed stock powers, in
either case signed exactly as the name or names of the registered owner or
owners appear on the certificates, with the signatures on the certificates or
stock powers guaranteed by an Eligible Institution as provided in the Letter of
Transmittal. See Instructions 1 and 5 to the Letter of Transmittal.

     Guaranteed Delivery.  If a stockholder desires to tender Shares pursuant to
the Offer and such stockholder's certificates for Shares are not immediately
available or time will not permit all required documents to reach the Depositary
prior to the Expiration Date or the procedure for book-entry transfer

cannot be completed on a timely basis, such Shares may nevertheless be tendered
if all of the following guaranteed delivery procedures are duly complied with:

          (i) the tender is made by or through an Eligible Institution;

          (ii) a properly completed and duly executed Notice of Guaranteed
     Delivery, substantially in the form made available by us, is received by
     the Depositary, as provided below, prior to the Expiration Date; and

          (iii) the certificates for all tendered Shares, in proper form for
     transfer (or in the case of Common Shares, a Book-Entry Confirmation),
     together with a properly completed and duly executed Letter of Transmittal
     (or a manually signed facsimile thereof), and any required signature
     guarantees, or, in the case of a book-entry transfer of Common Shares, an
     Agent's Message, and any other documents required by the Letter of
     Transmittal, are received by the Depositary within three trading days after
     the date of such Notice of Guaranteed Delivery. The term "trading day" is
     any day on which the Nasdaq Small Cap Market is open for business.

     The Notice of Guaranteed Delivery may be delivered by hand or transmitted
by facsimile transmission or mail to the Depositary and must include a guarantee
by an Eligible Institution in the form set forth in the Notice of Guaranteed
Delivery.

     The method of delivery of Shares, the Letter of Transmittal and all other
required documents, including delivery through the Book-Entry Transfer Facility,
is at the option and risk of the tendering stockholder. If delivery is by mail,
registered mail with return receipt requested, properly insured, is recommended.

     Notwithstanding any other provision hereof, payment for Shares accepted for
payment pursuant to the Offer will in all cases be made only after timely
receipt by the Depositary of (i) certificates for such Shares or in the case of
Common Shares, the Book-Entry Confirmation, (ii) a properly completed and duly
executed Letter of Transmittal (or a manually signed facsimile thereof), with
all required signature guarantees, or, in the case of a book-entry transfer of
Common Shares, an Agent's Message, and (iii) any other documents required by the
Letter of Transmittal.

     Backup Federal Income Tax Withholding.  To prevent "backup" withholding
with respect to payment of the purchase price of Shares purchased pursuant to
the Offer or pursuant to the Merger, each tendering stockholder must either
provide the Depositary with such stockholder's correct Taxpayer Identification
Number ("TIN") and certify that such stockholder is not subject to backup
federal income tax withholding by completing the Substitute Form W-9 included in
the Letter of Transmittal or establish some other exemption to backup
withholding. Foreign holders must submit a completed Form W-8 to avoid backup
withholding. This form may be obtained from the Depositary. See Instructions 8
and 9 set forth in the Letter of Transmittal and Section 5 -- "Certain United
States Federal Income Tax Considerations".

     Examination of Validity.  We will determine, in our sole discretion, all
questions as to the form of documents and the validity, eligibility (including
time of receipt) and acceptance for payment of any tender of Shares and our
determination will be final and binding on all parties. We reserve the absolute
right to reject any or all tenders of any Shares that we determine not to be in
proper form or the acceptance of or payment for which may, in our opinion, be
unlawful. We also reserve the absolute right to waive any of the conditions of
the Offer, subject to the limitations set forth in the Merger Agreement, or any
defect or irregularity in the tender of any Shares. Our interpretation of the
terms and conditions of the Offer (including the Letter of Transmittal and the
Instructions to the Letter of Transmittal) will be final and binding on all
parties. No tender of Shares will be deemed to have been validly made until all
defects and irregularities have been cured or waived. Neither we nor Parent, the
Depositary, the Information Agent or any other person will be under any duty to
give notification of any defects or irregularities in tenders or incur any
liability for failure to give any such notification.

     Other Requirements.  By executing the Letter of Transmittal as set forth
above (including through delivery of an Agent's Message), you irrevocably
appoint our designees as your attorneys-in-fact and proxies, each with full
power of substitution, in the manner set forth in the Letter of Transmittal, to
the full extent of your rights associated with such Shares tendered and accepted
for payment by us (including but not limited to all cash and non-cash dividends,
distributions, rights, other Shares or other securities issued, paid or
distributed or issuable, payable or distributable in respect thereof on or after
January 18, 2001 (including, without limitation, with respect to the Preferred
Shares, rights to dividends pursuant to Section 4.17 of the Preferred Stock
Purchase Agreement dated October 12, 1997 by and among the Company and Selling
Stockholders, as amended to the date of the Merger Agreement (the "Preferred
Stock Purchase Agreement")). All such powers of attorney and proxies shall be
considered coupled with an interest in the tendered Shares. This appointment is
effective when, and only to the extent that, we accept for payment the Shares
deposited with the Depositary. Upon acceptance for payment, all prior powers of
attorney and proxies granted by you with respect to such Shares or other
securities or rights will, without further action, be revoked and no subsequent
proxies may be given or written consent executed (and, if given or executed,
will not be deemed effective). Our designees will, with respect to the Shares
and other securities or rights, be empowered to exercise all your voting and
other rights as they in their sole judgment deem proper in respect of any annual
or special meeting of the Company's stockholders, or any adjournment or
postponement thereof. We reserve the right to require that, in order for Shares
to be deemed validly tendered, immediately upon our payment for such Shares, we
must be able to exercise full voting and other rights with respect to such
Shares and the other securities or rights issued or issuable in respect of such
Shares, including voting at any meeting of stockholders (whether annual or
special or whether or not adjourned) in respect of such Shares.

     A tender of Shares pursuant to any one of the procedures described above
will constitute your acceptance of the terms and conditions of the Offer, as
well as your representation and warranty that (i) you have the full power and
authority to tender, sell, assign and transfer the tendered Shares (and any and
all other Shares or other securities issued, paid or distributed or issuable,
payable or distributable in respect of such Shares on or after January 18, 2001)
and (ii) when we accept for payment the same we will acquire good and
unencumbered title thereto, free and clear of all liens, restrictions, charges
and encumbrances and not subject to any adverse claims. Our acceptance for
payment of Shares tendered pursuant to the Offer will constitute a binding
agreement between you and us upon the terms and subject to the conditions of the
Offer.

     4. WITHDRAWAL RIGHTS.  Except as otherwise provided in this Section
4 -- "Withdrawal Rights," tenders of Shares made pursuant to the Offer are
irrevocable. You may withdraw tenders of Shares made pursuant to the Offer at
any time prior to the Expiration Date. If purchase of or payment for Shares is
delayed for any reason, or if we are unable to purchase or pay for Shares for
any reason, then, without prejudice to our rights under the Offer, tendered
Shares may be retained by the Depositary on our behalf and may not be withdrawn
except to the extent that tendering stockholders are entitled to withdrawal
rights as set forth in this Section 4 -- "Withdrawal Rights," subject to Rule
14e-1(c) under the Exchange Act, which provides that no person who makes a
tender offer shall fail to pay the consideration offered or return the
securities deposited by or on behalf of security holders promptly after the
termination or withdrawal of the Offer.

     To withdraw Shares tendered pursuant to the Offer, a written, telegraphic,
telex or facsimile transmission notice of withdrawal must be timely received by
the Depositary at the address set forth on the back cover of this Offer to
Purchase and must specify the name of the person who tendered the Shares to be
withdrawn, the number of Shares to be withdrawn and the name of the registered
holder(s), if different from the name of the person who tendered such Shares. If
certificates for Shares to be withdrawn have been delivered or otherwise
identified to the Depositary, then, prior to the release of such certificates,
the serial numbers shown on such certificates must be submitted to the
Depositary and, unless such Shares have been tendered by an Eligible
Institution, the signatures on the notice of withdrawal must be guaranteed by an
Eligible Institution. If Shares have been tendered pursuant to the procedures
for book-entry transfer set forth in Section 3 -- "Procedure for Tendering
Shares," any notice of withdrawal must

also specify the name and number of the account at the Book-Entry Transfer
Facility to be credited with the withdrawn Shares and must otherwise comply with
such Book-Entry Transfer Facility's procedures. We will determine, in our sole
discretion, all questions as to the form and validity (including time of
receipt) of notices of withdrawal, and our determination will be final and
binding on all parties. None of the Offeror, Parent, the Depositary, the
Information Agent or any other person will be under any duty to give
notification of any defects or irregularities in any notice of withdrawal or
incur any liability for failure to give any such notification.

     Any Shares properly withdrawn will be deemed not validly tendered for
purposes of the Offer, but may be retendered at any subsequent time prior to the
Expiration Date by following any of the procedures described in Section
3 -- "Procedure for Tendering Shares".

     If we provide a Subsequent Offering Period following the Offer, no
withdrawal rights will apply to Shares tendered during such Subsequent Offering
Period or to Shares tendered in the Offer and accepted for payment.

     5. CERTAIN UNITED STATES FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSIDERATIONS.  The following
is a summary of certain United States federal income tax considerations of the
Offer and the Merger to holders whose Shares are purchased pursuant to the Offer
or whose Shares are converted to cash in the Merger (including pursuant to the
exercise of appraisal rights). The discussion is for general information only
and does not purport to consider all aspects of United States federal income
taxation that may be relevant to holders of Shares. The discussion is based on
current provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the
"Code"), existing, proposed and temporary regulations promulgated thereunder and
administrative and judicial interpretations thereof, all of which are subject to
change. The discussion applies only to holders of Shares in whose hands Shares
are capital assets within the meaning of Section 1221 of the Code, and may not
apply to Shares received pursuant to the exercise of employee stock options or
otherwise as compensation, or to certain types of holders of Shares (such as
insurance companies, tax-exempt organizations and broker-dealers) who may be
subject to special rules under the United States federal income tax laws. This
discussion does not discuss the United States federal income tax consequences to
a holder of Shares who, for United States federal income tax purposes, is a non-
resident alien individual, a foreign corporation, a foreign partnership or a
foreign estate or trust, nor does it consider the effect of any foreign, state
or local tax laws.

     Because individual circumstances may differ, each holder of Shares should
consult such holder's own tax advisor to determine the applicability of the
rules discussed below to such holder and the particular tax effects to such
holder of the Offer and the Merger, including the application and effect of
state, local and other income tax laws.

     The receipt of cash for Shares pursuant to the Offer or the Merger will be
a taxable transaction for United States federal income tax purposes. In general,
for United States federal income tax purposes, a holder of Shares will recognize
gain or loss equal to the difference between (i) the holder's adjusted tax basis
in the Shares sold pursuant to the Offer or converted to cash in the Merger and
(ii) the amount of cash received therefor. Gain or loss must be determined
separately for each block of Shares (i.e., Shares acquired at the same cost in a
single transaction) sold pursuant to the Offer or converted to cash in the
Merger. Assuming that Shares are held as a capital asset, such gain or loss will
be a capital gain or loss. Any such capital gain will be a long-term capital
gain taxable to a non-corporate holder at a maximum rate of 20% if the holder's
Shares have been held for more than one year on the date of sale (in the case of
the Offer) or the Effective Time of the Merger (in the case of the Merger); and
a short-term capital gain taxable to a non-corporate holder at a maximum rate of
up to 39.6% if the Shares have been held for one year or less on the date of
sale (or the Effective Time of the Merger).

     Payments in connection with the Offer or the Merger may be subject to
"backup withholding" at a rate of 31%, unless a holder of Shares (i) is a
corporation or comes within certain exempt categories and, when required,
demonstrates this fact or (ii) provides a correct TIN to the payor, certifies as
to no loss of exemption from backup withholding and otherwise complies with
applicable requirements of the backup withholding rules. A holder who does not
provide a correct TIN may be subject to penalties imposed by

the Internal Revenue Service. Any amount paid as backup withholding does not
constitute an additional tax and will be creditable against the holder's United
States federal income tax liability. Each holder of Shares should consult with
his or her own tax advisor as to his or her qualification for exemption from
backup withholding and the procedure for obtaining such exemption. Holders
tendering their Shares in the Offer may prevent backup withholding by completing
the Substitute Form W-9 included in the Letter of Transmittal. See Section
3 -- "Procedure for Tendering Shares." Similarly, holders who convert their
Shares into cash in the Merger may prevent backup withholding by completing a
Substitute Form W-9 and submitting it to the paying agent for the Merger.

     6. PRICE RANGE OF COMMON SHARES; DIVIDENDS ON COMMON SHARES.  The Common

(1) Through January 23, 2001.

     On January 17, 2001, the last full trading day prior to the announcement of
the Offer, the last reported closing sales price per Common Share as reported on
the Nasdaq Small Cap Market was $7.56. On January 23, 2001, the last full
trading day prior to the date of this Offer to Purchase, the last reported
closing sales price per Common Share as reported on the Nasdaq Small Cap Market
was $8.156.

     7. CERTAIN EFFECTS OF THE TRANSACTION. Market for Common Shares.  Our
purchase of the Common Shares pursuant to the Offer will reduce the number of
Common Shares that might otherwise trade publicly and will reduce the number of
holders of Common Shares. This could adversely affect the liquidity and market
value of the remaining Common Shares held by stockholders other than us.
Depending upon the aggregate market value and per share price of any Common
Shares not purchased pursuant to the Offer, the Common Shares may no longer meet
the standards for continued inclusion on the Nasdaq Small Cap Market, which
requires that an issuer have at least 500,000 publicly held shares with a market
value of $1 million held by at least 300 stockholders holding round lots and
have net tangible assets of at least $2 million. If these standards are not met,
the Common Shares might nevertheless continue to be included on the Nasdaq Stock
Market with quotations published on the Nasdaq's "additional list" or in one of
the "local lists." However, if the number of holders of Common Shares falls
below 300, or if the number of publicly held Common Shares falls below 500,000,
or if there are not at least two market makers for such Common Shares, NASD
rules provide that the Common Shares would no longer be "qualified" for Nasdaq
Stock Market reporting, and Nasdaq Stock Market would cease to provide any
quotations. Common Shares held directly or indirectly by an officer or director
of the Company, or by any beneficial owner of more than 10% of the Common
Shares, ordinarily will not

be considered as being publicly held for this purpose. If, as a result of the
purchase of Common Shares pursuant to the Offer or otherwise, the Common Shares
no longer meet the requirements for continued inclusion in any other tier of the
Nasdaq Stock Market, and the Common Shares are no longer included in any tier of
Nasdaq Stock Market, the market for such Common Shares could be adversely
affected.

     Depending upon the aggregate market value and per share price of any Common
Shares not purchased pursuant to the Offer, the Common Shares also may no longer
meet the standards for continued inclusion on the Boston Stock Exchange, which
requires that an issuer have at least 150,000 publicly held shares with a market
value of $500,000 held by at least 250 beneficial holders and have total assets
of at least $1 million. The Boston Stock Exchange reserves the right to deny the
listing of any company, and to suspend trading or delist a company based on the
failure to meet any of these requirements.

     In the event the Common Shares no longer meet the requirements for
inclusion in any tier of the Nasdaq Stock Market or the Boston Stock Exchange,
quotations might still be available from other sources. The extent of the public
market for such Common Shares and availability of such quotations would,
however, depend upon the number of holders of such Common Shares remaining at
such time, the interest in maintaining a market in the Common Shares on the part
of securities firms, the possible termination of registration of the Common
Shares under the Exchange Act, as described below, and other factors.

     The Company intends to delist the Common Shares from the Nasdaq Small Cap
Market and the Boston Stock Exchange as soon as practicable following the
consummation of the Offer and in any event following the consummation of the
Merger.

     Exchange Act Registration.  The Common Shares are currently registered
under the Exchange Act. Such registration may be terminated upon application by
the Company to the Commission if the Common Shares are not listed on a "national
securities exchange" and there are fewer than 300 record holders of Common
Shares. It is our intention to seek to cause an application for such termination
to be made as soon after consummation of the Offer as the requirements for
termination of registration of the Common Shares are met. If such registration
were terminated, the Company would no longer legally be required to disclose
publicly in proxy materials distributed to stockholders the information which it
now must provide under the Exchange Act or to make public disclosure of
financial and other information in annual, quarterly and other reports required
to be filed with the Commission under the Exchange Act, the requirements of Rule
13e-3 under the Exchange Act with respect to going private transactions would no
longer apply to the Company, and the officers, directors and 10% stockholders of
the Company would no longer be subject to the "short-swing" insider trading
reporting and profit recovery provisions of the Exchange Act. Furthermore, if
such registration were terminated, persons holding "restricted securities" of
the Company may be deprived of their ability to dispose of such securities under
Rule 144 promulgated under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the
"Securities Act").

     Margin Regulations.  The Common Shares are presently "margin securities"
under the regulations of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System
(the "Federal Reserve Board"), which status has the effect, among other things,
of allowing brokers to extend credit on the collateral of the Common Shares.
Depending upon factors similar to those described above regarding listing and
market quotations, it is possible that, following the Offer, the Common Shares
would no longer constitute "margin securities" for the purposes of the margin
regulations of the Federal Reserve Board and therefore could no longer be used
as collateral for loans made by brokers. In addition, if registration of the
Common Shares under the Exchange Act were terminated, the Common Shares would no
longer constitute "margin securities."

     8. CERTAIN INFORMATION CONCERNING THE COMPANY.  Except as otherwise set
forth herein, the information concerning the Company contained in this Offer to
Purchase, including financial information, has been furnished by the Company or
has been taken from or based upon publicly available documents and records on

     9. CERTAIN INFORMATION CONCERNING PARENT AND THE OFFEROR.  We are a Nevada
corporation that was formed as an acquisition vehicle in connection with the
Offer, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by the Merger
Agreement and we will be merged with and into the Company pursuant to the
Merger. We are a wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent.

     Parent is an independent energy company engaged in the exploration,
development, production and acquisition of crude oil and natural gas. North
American operations are focused in the shelf and deepwater areas of the Gulf of
Mexico, the Permian Basin, Mid-continent and Rocky Mountain regions.
Internationally, Ocean Energy holds a leading position among U.S. independents
in West Africa with oil and gas activities in Cote d'Ivoire, Equatorial Guinea
and Angola. The company also conducts operations in the republics of Egypt,
Tatarstan, Pakistan and Indonesia.

     The name, citizenship, business address, present principal occupation or
employment and five-year employment history of each of our directors and
executive officers as well as those of Parent are set forth in Schedule I
hereto.

     Except as provided in the Merger Agreement, the Tender and Voting
Agreement, the Tender Agreement and as otherwise described in this Offer to
Purchase, neither Parent nor us, nor, to the best of our knowledge and the best
knowledge of Parent, any of the persons listed on Schedule I hereto, has any
contract, arrangement, understanding or relationship with any other person with
respect to any securities of the Company, including, but not limited to, any
contract, arrangement, understanding or relationship concerning the transfer or
the voting of any securities of the Company, joint ventures, loan or option
arrangements, puts or calls, guarantees of loans, guarantees against loss or the
giving or withholding of proxies. Except as set forth in this Offer to Purchase,
none of Parent or us, or, to the best of our knowledge and the best knowledge of
Parent, none of the persons listed on Schedule I hereto, has had, within the
past two years, any business relationships or transactions with the Company or
any of its executive officers, directors or affiliates that would require
reporting under the rules of the Commission applicable to this Offer to
Purchase. Except as set forth in this Offer to Purchase, within the past two
years, there have been no contacts, negotiations or transactions between Parent
or us or any of Parent's respective subsidiaries, or, to the best of our
knowledge and the best knowledge of Parent, any of the persons listed on
Schedule I hereto, and the Company or its affiliates, concerning a merger,
consolidation

or acquisition, tender offer or other acquisition of securities, election of
directors or a sale or other transfer of a material amount of assets. Except as
set forth in this Offer to Purchase, neither we nor Parent, nor, to the best of
our knowledge and the best knowledge of Parent, any of the persons listed on
Schedule I hereto, beneficially owns any Shares or has effected any transactions
in the Shares during the past sixty days.

     10. SOURCE AND AMOUNT OF FUNDS.  The Offer is not conditioned on any
financing arrangements. We estimate that the total amount of funds required to
consummate the Offer and the Merger, make the Company Option Payments and
Company Warrant Payments and pay related fees and expenses will be approximately
$121 million. We will obtain the required funds from Parent in the form of
capital contributions or loans from Parent.

     Parent will provide such funds from borrowings under its $500 Revolving
Credit Agreement (the "Credit Facility"), dated as of March 30, 1999, among
Parent, Chase Bank of Texas, National Association, The Chase Manhattan Bank,
Bank of America National Trust and Savings Association, Bank One Texas, N. A.,
Societe Generale, Southwest Agency, the Bank of Montreal, and the other Banks
signatory thereto. The Credit Facility bears interest, at Parent's option, at a
competitive bid or LIBOR or prime rates plus applicable margins ranging from
zero to 1.7% or at a competitive bid. Parent expects to use funds generated from
its operations to repay its borrowings under the Credit Facility.

     The foregoing summary of the Credit Facility is qualified in its entirety
by reference to the Credit Facility, which is incorporated herein by reference,
and a copy of which has been filed as an exhibit to the Schedule TO filed by
Parent and us with the Commission in connection with the Offer. The Credit
Facility may be examined and copies may be obtained at the places described in
Section 8.

     11. BACKGROUND OF THE OFFER; PAST CONTACTS, TRANSACTIONS OR NEGOTIATIONS
WITH THE COMPANY.

     On September 14, 2000, at a charity event held in Houston, Texas, Mr. John
D. Schiller, Jr., Parent's executive vice president of operations, Mr. William
L. Transier, Parent's executive vice president and chief financial officer, and
Mr. Thomas A. Reiser, a member of the Company's board of directors, had initial
discussions regarding the possibilities of Parent's acquisition of the Company.
On October 20, 2000, an initial meeting was held at Mr. Schiller's office to
further discuss such acquisition possibilities. Attendees at the meeting
included Mr. Schiller, Mr. Jerry M. Crews, an executive vice president of the
Company, and Mr. Reiser. The attendees agreed that the process of evaluation
should begin by means of a limited due diligence review of the Company by
Parent's representatives.

     On October 30, 2000, Parent and the Company executed a Confidentiality
Agreement pursuant to which the Company agreed to supply certain information to
Parent and Parent agreed to treat such information as confidential and to use
such information solely in connection with the evaluation of a possible
transaction with the Company.

     On November 6, 2000, Parent's technical team of exploration, land, legal
and business development personnel reviewed data concerning the Company's assets
with certain members of the Company's management, including Mr. Frank A.
Lodzinski, the Company's President, Mr. Crews, Mr. Tom Campbell, the Company's
manager of acquisitions, and Mr. Francis M. Mury, an executive vice president of
the Company. On November 14, 2000, an initial internal presentation was made by
Parent's technical team to Mr. Schiller regarding the information provided by
the Company.

     On November 20, 2000, Messrs. Schiller, Transier, John H. Campbell, Vice
President, Reservoir Engineering -- North America of Parent, and Alan Smith,
Manager of Business Development -- North America of Parent, met with Messrs.
Lodzinski, Crews and Reiser at Parent's offices in Houston, Texas to discuss
potential valuation and projects. On November 28, 2000, Parent's technical team
reviewed the Company's major fields with representatives of the Company and W.D.
vonGonten & Co, consulting petroleum reservoir engineers for the Company. On
November 28, 2000, Mr. Lodzinski, Ms. Adriene Bond, Company counsel, Mr. Robert
K. Reeves, Parent's general counsel, Mr. Transier and Mr. Andrew J. Sheu,
Parent's vice president of tax, met at Parent's offices to discuss the potential
deal structure, tax issues, and the due diligence process.

     On December 11, 2000, Parent's technical team completed asset evaluations
of the Company and its operations and made an internal presentation to Parent's
senior management, which in turn decided to recommend to Parent's Board of
Directors that Parent pursue a possible transaction with the Company. On
December 13, 2000, senior management communicated its findings to the Parent's
Board of Directors, and the Board gave its approval to proceed with a possible
transaction with the Company. On December 13, 2000, Parent and the Company
exchanged bullet-point outlines of certain proposed terms of the transaction. As
proposed by Parent, the transaction was to be structured as a merger in which a
newly-formed subsidiary of Parent would be merged with the Company and the
Company's stockholders would receive in exchange for their shares aggregate
consideration of $115 million ($8.25 per Common Share) consisting of 50% stock
of Parent and 50% cash, with the receipt of Parent stock to be tax-free to the
Company's stockholders. Other terms included the cash-out of options and
warrants at the closing of the merger, a requirement that management, directors
and significant stockholders of the Company agree to vote in favor of the
merger, and certain other terms and conditions.

     On December 18, 2000, Parent and the Company executed an additional
Confidentiality Agreement pursuant to which Parent agreed to supply certain
information to the Company and the Company agreed to treat such information as
confidential and to use such information solely in connection with the
evaluation of a possible transaction with Parent.

     On December 18, 2000, Parent's outside counsel distributed to the parties
for their review and comment a preliminary draft of a merger agreement. On
December 26 and 27, 2000 and January 2 and 3, 2001, representatives of Parent
made field visits to certain of Company's operated oil and gas fields.

     On January 3, 2001, Parent's outside counsel, Mr. Transier and Mr. Reeves
met with Mr. Lodzinski, Mr. Will VanLoh, Principal of Quantum Energy Partners
LP, and Mr. Michael P. Dalton, Associate of Quantum Energy Partners LP, at
Parent's offices to discuss the purchase price for the Common Shares and
Preferred Shares, various alternative structures for the acquisition, including
a possible all cash transaction, the timing of the transaction and various other
agreement terms. At this meeting, Parent indicated that it would be willing to
do an all cash acquisition if the transaction were structured as a tender offer
and merger and a majority of stockholders committed to tender their shares and
vote for the transaction.

     On January 4, 2001, Mr. VanLoh met with Mr. Reeves at Parent's offices to
further discuss potential structure and share price. On January 7, 2001, revised
agreements reflecting an all-cash tender offer and merger were distributed to
Parent, the Company and their respective representatives.

     Between January 7 and January 16, 2001, there were various telephone
conferences between Mr. Reeves, Mr. Lodzinski and outside counsel to negotiate
provisions of the merger agreement, the Tender and Voting Agreement and the
Tender Agreement, and additional due diligence was conducted by Parent's outside
counsel.

     On January 17, 2001, at a special telephonic meeting of Parent's Board of
Directors in which all but one of Parent's directors participated, members of
Parent's senior management presented Parent's Board with details regarding the
Company, results of the due diligence investigation and the terms of the merger
agreement. At the conclusion of the meeting, Parent's Board approved and
authorized the execution of the Merger Agreement, the Tender and Voting
Agreement and the Tender Agreement, and the commencement of the Offer.

     The Company's Board of Directors held a telephonic special meeting on
January 17, 2001, at which eight of the Company's nine directors were present.
At the meeting, the Company's Board considered the final terms of the Offer, the
Merger, the Merger Agreement, the Tender and Voting Agreement and the Tender
Agreement. The Company's legal advisors summarized the final terms of the
proposed transaction. The Company's Board also received and participated in a
presentation by Dain Rauscher Wessels with respect to the financial terms of the
proposed transaction.

     At the conclusion of its presentation, the representative of Dain Rauscher
Wessels delivered the oral opinion of Dain Rauscher Wessels to the Company's
Board that, as of such date, the Common Share

Offer Price and the Preferred Share Offer Price in the Offer and pursuant to the
Merger Agreement were fair, from a financial point of view, to the Company's
stockholders. Dain Rauscher Wessels subsequently confirmed its oral opinion by
letter dated January 17, 2001. At the conclusion of the January 17 meeting, the
Company's Board approved and authorized the execution of the Merger Agreement
and approved the transactions contemplated thereby, including the Offer, the
Merger, the Tender and Voting Agreement and the Tender Agreement, and
recommended that the Company's stockholders accept the Offer, tender their
Common Shares and Preferred Shares pursuant to the Offer and approve the Merger
Agreement, the Tender and Voting Agreement, the Tender Agreement, and the
Merger.

     On January 18, 2001, the respective parties to the Merger Agreement, the
Tender and Voting Agreement and the Tender Agreement executed and delivered such
agreements, and Parent and the Company issued a joint press release announcing
the signing of the Merger Agreement.

     12. PURPOSE OF THE OFFER AND THE MERGER; PLANS FOR THE COMPANY.  The
purpose of the Offer, the Merger, the Merger Agreement, the Tender and Voting
Agreement and the Tender Agreement is to enable us to acquire control of, and
the entire equity interest in, the Company. The Offer, the Merger Agreement, the
Tender and Voting Agreement and the Tender Agreement are intended to increase
the likelihood that the Merger will be effected as promptly as practicable.

     Consummation of the Merger requires the approval of the Merger Agreement by
holders of a majority of the votes entitled to be cast by holders of (a) the
Common Shares and the Preferred Shares, voting together as a single class, with
each Preferred Share entitling the holder thereof to the number of votes equal
to the full number of Common Shares into which such Preferred Share is
convertible on the record date for such vote, (b) the Common Shares, voting as a
single class, and (c) the Preferred Shares, voting as a single class. The
Company's Board of Directors has approved the Offer, the Merger and the Merger
Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby. The Company has agreed (if
required by applicable law to consummate the Merger) to take all action
necessary to convene a meeting of its stockholders as promptly as practicable
after the consummation of the Offer for the purpose of obtaining stockholder
approval of the Merger. We have agreed that, subject to applicable law, all
Shares we own, and all Shares owned by Parent or any of Parent's other
subsidiaries will be voted in favor of the Merger. The stockholders' meeting
shall be held as soon as practicable (subject to any statutory or other
restrictions) following the purchase of Shares pursuant to the Offer.

     Shares outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and which are
(i) held by holders of Shares who shall have not voted in favor of the Merger or
consented to the Merger in writing and (ii) who shall have demanded properly in
writing payment of the fair market value of such Shares in accordance with
Section 92A.420 of the Nevada Revised Statutes (collectively, the "Dissenting
Shares") shall be cancelled and terminated and shall represent solely the right
to receive payment from the Surviving Corporation of the fair market value of
such Shares held by them in accordance with the provisions of the Nevada Revised
Statutes.

     However, holders of Shares who shall have failed to perfect or who
effectively shall have withdrawn or lost their rights for an appraisal of such
shares under the Nevada Revised Statutes shall thereupon have such shares be
deemed to have been cancelled and terminated, as of the Effective Time, and
shall represent solely the right to receive the Common Share Offer Price or the
Preferred Share Offer Price as provided in Section 3.06 of the Merger Agreement,
as applicable, upon surrender of the certificate or certificates that formerly
evidenced such Shares in the manner provided in Section 3.07 of the Merger
Agreement.

     The Company will give to Parent (i) prompt notice of any demands for
appraisal received by the Company, withdrawals of such demands, and any other
instruments served pursuant to the Nevada Revised Statutes and received by the
Company and (ii) the opportunity to direct all negotiations and proceedings with
respect to demands for payment of fair market value under the Nevada Revised
Statutes. The Company shall not, except with the prior written consent of
Parent, make any payment with respect to any such demands, or offer to settle,
or settle, any such demands. Any amount payable to any holder of Shares
exercising dissenters' rights shall be paid solely by the Surviving Corporation
out of its own funds.

     The foregoing summary of the rights of objecting stockholders does not
purport to be a complete statement of the procedures to be followed by
stockholders desiring to exercise their dissenters' appraisal rights. The
preservation and exercise of dissenters' rights are conditioned on strict
adherence to the applicable provisions of the Nevada Revised Statutes. See
Section 15 -- "Certain Legal Matters" for additional information regarding
appraisal rights.

     Rule 13e-3.  The Commission has adopted Rule 13e-3 under the Exchange Act,
which is applicable to certain "going private" transactions and which may, under
certain circumstances, be applicable to the Merger or another business
combination following the purchase of Shares pursuant to the Offer or otherwise
in which we seek to acquire the remaining Shares not held by us. We believe,
however, that Rule 13e-3 will not be applicable to the Merger if the Merger is
consummated within one year after the termination of the Offer at the same per
Share price as paid in the Offer. If applicable, Rule 13e-3 requires, among
other things, that certain financial information concerning the Company and
certain information relating to the fairness of the proposed transaction and the
consideration offered to minority stockholders in such transaction be filed with
the Commission and disclosed to stockholders prior to consummation of the
transaction.

     Plans for the Company.  As described herein, if we purchase Shares pursuant
to the Offer, the Merger Agreement provides that we will be entitled to
designate representatives to serve on the Board of Directors of the Company in
proportion to our ownership of Shares following such purchase; provided,
however, that, until the Effective Time, there must be at least two Independent
Directors. Promptly upon the consummation of the Offer, we currently intend to
seek maximum representation on the Company's Board of Directors permitted by the
Merger Agreement. We expect that our representation on the Company's Board of
Directors would permit us to exert substantial influence over the Company's
conduct of its business and operations. As a result of the Merger, our directors
and officers immediately prior to the Effective Time will become the directors
and officers, respectively, of the Company, as the Surviving Corporation. See
Section 13 -- "The Merger Agreement, the Tender and Voting Agreement, the Tender
Agreement and the Confidentiality Agreements".

     We and Parent expect that, initially following the Merger, the business and
operations of the Company will, except as described in this Offer to Purchase,
be continued substantially as they are currently being conducted. Parent will
continue to evaluate the business and operations of the Company during the
pendency of the Offer and after the consummation of the Offer and the Merger and
will take such actions as it deems appropriate under the circumstances then
existing. Parent intends to seek additional information about the Company during
this period. Thereafter, Parent intends to review such information as part of a
comprehensive review of the Company's business, assets, operations,
capitalization, dividend policy, management and personnel, with a view to
optimizing development of the Company's potential in conjunction with Parent's
current and future business.

     Except as described above or elsewhere in this Offer to Purchase, we and
Parent have no present plans or proposals that would relate to or result in (i)
the acquisition by any person of additional securities of the Company, or the
disposition of securities of the Company, (ii) an extraordinary corporate
transaction, such as a merger, reorganization or liquidation, involving the
Company or any and all corporations, partnerships, joint ventures, associations,
limited liability companies and other entities controlled by the Company,
directly or indirectly through one or more intermediaries (the "Company
Subsidiaries"), (iii) a sale or transfer of a material amount of assets of the
Company or of any Company Subsidiaries, (iv) any change in the present board of
directors or management of the Company (v) any material change in the present
capitalization or dividend policy of the Company, (vi) any other material change
in the Company's business or corporate structure, (vii) changes in the Company's
charter, bylaws or instruments corresponding thereto or other actions which may

     13. THE MERGER AGREEMENT, THE TENDER AND VOTING AGREEMENT, THE TENDER
AGREEMENT AND THE CONFIDENTIALITY AGREEMENTS.  The following is a summary of
certain material provisions of the Merger Agreement, the Tender and Voting
Agreement, the Tender Agreement and the Confidentiality Agreement, copies of
which are attached as exhibits to the Schedule TO we filed in connection with
the Offer. These summaries do not purport to be complete and are qualified in
their entirety by reference to the respective texts of the Merger Agreement, the
Tender and Voting Agreement and the Tender Agreement. Capitalized terms used in
this Section 13 and not otherwise defined in this Offer to Purchase shall have
the meanings set forth in the Merger Agreement.

     THE MERGER AGREEMENT

     The Offer.  The Merger Agreement provides that not later than the fifth
business day from the public announcement by Parent and the Company of the
execution of the Merger Agreement, we shall commence the Offer to purchase all
outstanding Common Shares at the Common Share Offer Price and all outstanding
Preferred Shares at the Preferred Share Offer Price. Any Shares acquired
pursuant to the Offer will include, by way of amplification and not limitation,
all rights associated with such Shares, including but not limited to all cash
and non-cash dividends, distributions, rights, other Shares or other securities
issued or issuable in respect thereof on or after the date of the Merger
Agreement (including, without limitation, with respect to the Preferred Shares,
rights to dividends pursuant to Section 4.17 of the Preferred Stock Purchase
Agreement). Our obligation to accept for payment and to pay for any Shares
pursuant to the Offer is subject only to the satisfaction of the Minimum
Condition as set forth on Annex I to the Merger Agreement and other conditions
set forth in Section 14 -- "Certain Conditions to Our Obligations" (the "Tender
Offer Conditions"). In addition to our agreement to file with the Commission a
Tender Offer Statement on Schedule TO (together with all amendments and
supplements thereto, the "Schedule TO") with respect to the Offer, which
contains or incorporates by reference this Offer to Purchase and forms of the
related letters of transmittal and other ancillary offer documents
(collectively, together with all supplements and amendments thereto, being
referred to as the "Offer Documents"), we shall also disseminate to holders of
Shares the Offer Documents to the extent required by law, and otherwise shall
comply in all material respects with the Exchange Act. The Common Share Offer
Price and Preferred Share Offer Price shall be net to the seller in cash,
without interest, subject to reduction only for any applicable withholding taxes
or stock transfer taxes payable by the seller. The Company agrees that no Shares
held by the Company or any of its subsidiaries will be tendered in the Offer.

     We specifically reserve the right to waive any condition of the Offer, to
increase the Common Share Offer Price and Preferred Share Offer Price and to
make any other changes in the terms and conditions of the Offer, provided that
without the prior written consent of the Company, we shall not decrease the
Common Share Offer Price or the Preferred Share Offer Price or change the form
of consideration payable in the Offer, decrease the number of Shares sought to
be purchased in the Offer, impose additional conditions to the Offer or amend
any other term of the Offer in any manner materially adverse to the holders of
Shares or reduce the time period during which the Offer shall remain open.
Subject to the terms of the Offer and the Merger Agreement and the satisfaction
or waiver of all the Tender Offer Conditions as of any Expiration Date, we will
accept for payment and pay for all Shares validly tendered and not withdrawn
pursuant to the Offer as soon as practicable after such Expiration Date of the
Offer. Notwithstanding the foregoing, we shall be entitled to extend the Offer,
without the consent of the Company if at the Expiration Date of the Offer, which
will be 12:00 midnight eastern standard time twenty business days following
commencement of the Offer (the "Expiration Date"), or any extension thereof, any
condition to the Offer is not satisfied or waived, and we agree to extend the
Offer from time to time until May 31, 2001 if at the then scheduled Expiration
Date all of the conditions to the Offer have not been satisfied or waived as
permitted by the Merger Agreement; provided, however, we shall not be required
to extend the Offer under this provision unless, in Parent's reasonable
judgment, (i) each such condition is reasonably capable of being satisfied; (ii)
the Company is in material compliance with all of its covenants in the Merger
Agreement; and (iii) the failure of such condition to be satisfied shall not
result from a breach by the Company of any of its covenants and agreements
contained in the Merger Agreement. Any extension of the Offer pursuant to this
provision of the Merger Agreement shall not,

without the written consent of the Company, exceed the number of days that we
reasonably believe will be necessary so that the conditions to the Offer will be
satisfied. In addition, we may, without the consent of the Company, extend any
then scheduled Expiration Date of the Offer for any period required by
applicable rules, regulations, interpretations or positions of the Commission or
the Commission's staff applicable to the Offer or for any period required by
applicable law. If the Minimum Condition has been satisfied and all other
conditions to the Offer have been satisfied or waived but fewer than 90% of the
Shares have been validly tendered and not withdrawn as of the Expiration Date,
we shall accept and purchase all of the Shares tendered in the initial offer
period and may provide for a subsequent offering period (as contemplated by Rule
14d-11 under the Exchange Act) as long as providing for the subsequent offering
period does not require the extension of the initial offer period under
applicable rules and regulations of the Commission, which subsequent offering
period shall not exceed twenty business days. In addition, the Common Share
Offer Price and Preferred Share Offer Price may be increased and the Offer may
be extended to the extent required by law in connection with such increase in
each case without the consent of the Company. On or prior to the dates that we
become obligated to accept for payment and pay for Shares pursuant to the Offer,
Parent shall provide or cause to be provided to us the funds necessary to pay
for all Shares that we become so obligated to accept for payment and pay for
pursuant to the Offer.

     Company Actions.  Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, the Company has agreed
that on the date of the filing by Parent and us of the Offer Documents, it will
file with the Commission and mail to its stockholders a
Solicitation/Recommendation Statement on Schedule 14D-9 reflecting the
recommendation of the Board of Directors of the Company that the holders of
Shares tender their Shares pursuant to the Offer. The Schedule 14D-9 will set
forth, and the Company represents, that the Company's Board of Directors, at a
meeting duly called and held, has unanimously (i) determined by vote of its
directors present at the meeting at which the Merger Agreement was approved that
the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, including each of the
Offer, the Merger, the Tender Agreement and the Tender and Voting Agreement, are
fair to and in the best interests of the Company and its stockholders, (ii)
approved the Offer and approved and adopted the Merger Agreement and declared
its advisability in accordance with the Nevada Revised Statutes, and (iii)
recommended acceptance of the Offer and approval of the Merger Agreement by the
Company's stockholders (if such approval is required by applicable law). The
Company also represents that prior to the execution of the Merger Agreement, the
Company's financial advisor has delivered to the Company's Board of Directors
its written opinion that the consideration to be received for Shares pursuant to
the Offer and the Merger is fair to the Company's stockholders from a financial
point of view.

     Board Representation.  The Merger Agreement provides that, promptly upon
the payment by us for the Shares pursuant to the Offer and from time to time
thereafter (provided, however, that we shall not be entitled to designate any
members to the Board of Directors of the Company without owning a majority of
the Common Shares and a majority of the Preferred Shares), we will be entitled
to designate (i) such number of Class A directors, rounded up to the next whole
number, on the Board of Directors of the Company as is equal to the product of
the total number of Class A directors on the Board of Directors of the Company
(determined after giving effect to the directors elected pursuant to this
provision) multiplied by the percentage that the aggregate number of Shares
beneficially owned by Parent or its Affiliates (calculated on an as converted
basis) bears to the total number of Shares then outstanding (calculated on an as
converted basis), and (ii) such number of Class B directors, rounded up to the
next whole number, on the Board of Directors of the Company as is equal to the
product of the total number of Class B directors on the Board of Directors of
the Company (determined after giving effect to the directors elected pursuant to
this sentence) multiplied by the percentage that the aggregate number of
Preferred Shares beneficially owned by Parent or its Affiliates bears to the
total number of Preferred Shares then outstanding, and the Company shall, upon
our request, promptly take all actions necessary to cause our designees to be so
elected, including, if necessary, seeking the resignations of one or more
existing directors, increasing the number of authorized directors or amending
its bylaws; provided, however, that until the Effective Time, the Company's
Board of Directors shall have at least two members who were directors of the
Company on the date of the Merger Agreement and not employees of the Company
(the "Independent Directors"), provided that if no Independent Directors remain,
the other directors shall

designate one person to fill one of the vacancies who shall be neither an
employee of the Company nor an Affiliate of Parent and such person shall be
deemed to be an Independent Director for purposes of the Merger Agreement. Upon
our written request, the Company shall cause our designees to constitute the
same percentage of representation as is on the Board of Directors of the Company
after giving effect to this provision on (i) each committee of the Board of
Directors of the Company; (ii) the Board of Directors of each Company Subsidiary
(defined in the Merger Agreement as any and all corporations, partnerships,
joint ventures, associations, limited liability companies and other entities
controlled by the Company, directly or indirectly through one or more
intermediaries); and (iii) each committee of each such board. These provisions
shall not limit any rights that we, Parent or any of our Affiliates may have as
a holder or beneficial owner of Shares as a matter of law with respect to the
election of directors or otherwise.

     The Company's obligations to appoint our designees to the Board of
Directors of the Company shall be subject to Section 14(f) of the Exchange Act
and Rule 14f-1 thereunder. The Company shall promptly take all actions required
pursuant to such Section and Rule in order to fulfill its obligations under this
provision of the Merger Agreement and shall include in the Schedule 14D-9 mailed
to stockholders promptly after the commencement of the Offer (or an amendment
thereof or an information statement pursuant to Rule 14f-1 if we have not prior
to the mailing of the Schedule 14D-9 designated directors or timely provided the
requisite information) such information with respect to the Company and its
officers and directors as is required under such Section and Rule in order to
fulfill its obligations under this provision. We and Parent will supply any
information with respect to itself and its officers, directors and Affiliates
required by such Section and Rule to the Company. Following the election or
appointment of Parent's designees and prior to the Effective Time, any amendment
or termination of the Merger Agreement by the Company, any extension of time for
performance of any of the obligations of Parent or us under the Merger
Agreement, any waiver of any condition or any of the Company's rights thereunder
or other action by the Company adversely affecting the rights of the
stockholders of the Company (other than us or our affiliates), requires the
concurrence of the Independent Directors.

     The Merger.  The Merger Agreement provides that at the Effective Time, we
shall be merged with and into the Company. As a result of the Merger, our
separate corporate existence shall cease and the Company shall continue as the
Surviving Corporation and shall succeed to and assume all of our rights and
obligations in accordance with the Nevada Revised Statutes.

     At the Effective Time, the Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws of the
Surviving Corporation shall be amended to be identical to our Articles of
Incorporation and Bylaws as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time
(except that the name of the Surviving Corporation shall be "OEI Resources,
Inc."), in each case until duly amended in accordance with applicable law. Our
directors and officers shall become the directors and officers of the Surviving
Corporation at the Effective Time.

     Effect on Capital Stock.  As of the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger
and without any action on the part of the holder of any Shares, each Share that
is issued and outstanding (other than Shares owned by the Company as treasury
stock, and any Shares owned by Parent, us, or any other wholly-owned subsidiary
of Parent, which shall be cancelled, and Shares held by stockholders who have
properly exercised appraisal rights under the Nevada Revised Statutes, if any)
shall be cancelled and terminated and shall represent solely the right to
receive from the Surviving Corporation in cash, without interest, the Common
Share Offer Price (or any higher price paid for Common Shares in the Offer) or
the Preferred Share Offer Price (or any higher price paid for Preferred Shares
in the Offer) as applicable. Each share of our stock issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall, at the Effective Time, by virtue
of the Merger and without any action on the part of the holder of any of our
shares, be converted into and become one fully paid and nonassessable share of
common stock of the Surviving Corporation.

     Shares of Dissenting Stockholders.  Notwithstanding any provision of the
Merger Agreement to the contrary, Shares that are outstanding immediately prior
to the Effective Time and which are held by holders who shall have not voted in
favor of the Merger or consented thereto in writing and who shall have demanded
properly in writing payment of the fair market value of such Shares in
accordance with the

Nevada Revised Statutes (collectively, the "Dissenting Shares") shall be
cancelled and terminated and shall represent solely the right to receive payment
from the Surviving Corporation of the fair market value of such Shares held by
them in accordance with the provisions of the Nevada Revised Statutes, except
that all Dissenting Shares held by holders of Shares who shall have failed to
perfect or who effectively shall have withdrawn or lost their rights for an
appraisal of such Shares under the Nevada Revised Statutes shall thereupon be
deemed to have been cancelled and terminated, as of the Effective Time, and
shall represent solely the right to receive the Common Share Offer Price or the
Preferred Offer Share Price, as applicable, upon surrender in the manner
provided in Section 3.07 of the Merger Agreement of the certificate or
certificates that formerly evidenced such Shares.

     The Company shall give to Parent (i) prompt notice of any demands for
appraisal received by the Company, withdrawals of such demands, and any other
instruments served pursuant to the Nevada Revised Statutes and received by the
Company and (ii) the opportunity to direct all negotiations and proceedings with
respect to demands for payment of fair market value under the Nevada Revised
Statutes. The Company shall not, except with the prior written consent of
Parent, make any payment with respect to any such demands, or offer to settle,
or settle, any such demands. Any amount payable to any holder of Shares
exercising dissenters' rights shall be paid solely by the Surviving Corporation
out of its own funds.

     See Section 15 -- "Certain Legal Matters" for additional information
regarding appraisal rights.

     Stock Options.  Each outstanding and unexercised option to purchase Common
Shares ("Company Option") pursuant to each stock option and incentive plan of or
sponsored by the Company (the "Company Option Plans"), that is fully vested and
exercisable as of the consummation of the Offer shall be converted into an
obligation of the Company to pay, and a right of the holder thereof to receive
in full satisfaction of such Company Option, an amount in cash equal to the
product of (i) the excess, if any, of the Common Share Offer Price over the
exercise price thereof and (ii) the number of Common Shares subject to such
Company Option (such payment to be net of withholding taxes) (the "Company
Option Payments"). The Company shall take all actions necessary to cause the
Company's employees and directors to consent, to the extent required, to the
transactions contemplated by this provision no later than immediately prior to
the time we accept Shares for payment pursuant to the Offer. Except as may be
otherwise agreed to by Parent or us and the Company, as of the Effective Time,
(A) the Company Option Plans shall terminate, (B) the provisions in any other
plan, program or arrangement providing for the issuance or grant of any other
interest in respect of the capital stock of the Company or any of the Company
Subsidiaries shall be deleted and (C) no holder of Company Options or any
participant in the Company Option Plans or any other plans, programs or
arrangements shall have any rights thereunder to acquire any equity securities
of the Company, the Surviving Corporation or any subsidiary thereof. The Company
and Parent agree that the Company Option Payments are the sole payments that
will be made with respect to or in relation to the Company Options.

     With respect to each Company Option granted pursuant to the terms of a
Company Option Plan that is not vested and exercisable as of the consummation of
the Offer, the Company or the Surviving Corporation, as applicable, shall make
the payment of the amount determined above at the time each such unvested
Company Option would otherwise have become vested and exercisable subject to the
satisfaction of the terms and conditions set forth in the applicable option
award agreement and the Company Option Plan pursuant to which such Company
Option was granted, or at such earlier date as may be determined by Parent in
its sole and absolute discretion.

     Warrants.  At the Effective Time, each warrant to purchase Common Shares
that is then outstanding and exercisable (each a "Company Warrant"), shall be
cancelled and converted into the right to receive cash in an amount equal to the
product of (i) the excess, if any, of the Common Share Offer Price over the
exercise price of such Company Warrant and (ii) the number of Common Shares
previously subject to such Company Warrant immediately prior to its cancellation
(such payment to be net of withholding taxes) (the "Company Warrant Payments").
The Company shall take all actions necessary to cause the holders of the Company
Warrants to consent, to the extent required, to the transactions contemplated by
this provision no later than immediately prior to the time we accept Shares for
payment pursuant to the

Offer. The Company and Parent agree that the Company Warrant Payments are the
sole payments that will be made with respect to or in relation to the Company
Warrants.

     Representations and Warranties.  In the Merger Agreement, the Company has
made customary representations and warranties to us and to Parent, including,
but not limited to, representations and warranties as to organization and
qualification, subsidiaries, capital structure, authority to enter into the
Merger Agreement and to consummate the transactions contemplated thereby,
required consents and approvals, filings made by the Company with the Commission
under the Exchange Act (including financial statements included in the documents
filed by the Company under that act), absence of material adverse changes,
absence of litigation, material contracts, title to property, oil and gas
operations, wells and equipment, reserve reports, hedging, employee benefit
plans, environmental laws and regulations, intellectual property, tax matters,
liability insurance, the inapplicability of certain state takeover statutes,
engagement of brokers and finders and absence of bankruptcy. Some of the
Company's representations are qualified by the limitation that, in order for the
representation to have been breached, the event breaching the representation
must have a Material Adverse Effect. A "Material Adverse Effect" means any
event, circumstance, condition, development or occurrence causing, resulting in
or having (or with the passage of time likely to cause, result in or have) a
material adverse effect on the financial condition, business, assets, properties
or results of operations of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries taken as a
whole; provided, that such term shall not include (i) changes in the market
price and trading volume of the Company's securities or (ii) effects that are
not applicable primarily to the Company resulting from market conditions
generally in the oil and gas industry (including without limitation changes in
commodities prices).

     We and Parent have also made customary representations and warranties to
the Company, including, but not limited to, representations and warranties as to
organization and authority of us and Parent to enter into the Merger Agreement
and to consummate the transactions contemplated thereby, required consents and
approvals, financing and engagement of brokers and finders.

     Required Stockholder Vote or Consent.  The Company has represented to us
that the only vote of the holders of any class or series of the Company's
capital stock that will be necessary or required under the Merger Agreement,
Nevada Revised Statutes or under applicable law to consummate the Merger and the
other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement is the approval and
adoption of the Merger Agreement by the holders of a majority of the votes
entitled to be cast by holders of (a) the Common Shares and the Preferred
Shares, voting together as a single class, with each Preferred Share entitling
the holder thereof to the number of votes equal to the full number of Common
Shares into which such Preferred Share is convertible on the record date for
such vote, (b) the Common Shares, voting as a single class, and (c) the
Preferred Shares, voting as a single class (the "Company Stockholders'
Approval"). In the Merger Agreement, the Company also agreed that within four
business days of the date of the Merger Agreement it would by action of its
Board of Directors amend its bylaws such that the Company elects not to be
subject to Sections 78.378 through 78.3793 of the NRS (which relate to "control
shares"). See Section 15 -- "Certain Legal Matters".

     Stockholder Action.  Following consummation of the Offer, if required by
applicable law in order to consummate the Merger, the Company shall, in
accordance with applicable law, give notice of, convene and hold a special
meeting of its stockholders (the "Company Stockholders' Meeting") for the
purpose of securing the Company Stockholders' Approval. The date of any Company
Stockholders' Meeting shall be set by the Board of Directors of the Company
after consultation with, and on a date approved by, Parent, whose approval shall
not be unreasonably withheld. The Board of Directors of the Company shall (i)
distribute to its stockholders a proxy statement pursuant to Regulation 14A
under the Exchange Act or, if applicable law and regulations do not so require,
an information statement pursuant to Regulation 14C under the Exchange Act (the
"Proxy Statement") in accordance with applicable federal and state law and with
its Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws, which Proxy Statement shall contain
(A) the recommendation of the Board of Directors of the Company that its
stockholders approve the Merger and adopt the Merger Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby if proxies are solicited by the Company with
respect to such vote and (B) the written opinion of Dain Rauscher Wessels, a

division of Dain Rauscher Incorporated, that the consideration to be received
for the Shares pursuant to the Offer and the Merger is fair to the Company's
stockholders from a financial point of view, (ii) cause the Company to use all
reasonable efforts to solicit from its stockholders proxies in favor of the
approval of the Merger and adoption of the Merger Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby and to secure the Company Stockholders' Approval, unless, in
accordance with applicable law and the regulations of the Nasdaq Small Cap
Market, such solicitation is not required to achieve approval of the Merger,
(iii) take all other action in their judgment necessary and appropriate to
secure the Company Stockholders' Approval, and (iv) cooperate and consult with
Parent with respect to each of the foregoing matters, all subject to the right
of the Board of Directors of the Company to modify or withdraw its
recommendation in the exercise of its fiduciary duties to the Company and its
stockholders. Parent agrees that it will vote, or cause to be voted, all of the
Shares then owned by it, us or any other Company Subsidiaries in favor of the
approval of the Merger and of the Merger Agreement.

     Covenants Relating to the Conduct of Business.  During the period from the
date of the Merger Agreement until the time of the closing of the Merger (except
as provided in the Disclosure Letter or otherwise contemplated by the Merger
Agreement), the Company has agreed that the businesses of the Company and the
Company Subsidiaries will be conducted only in, and the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries shall not take any action except in, the ordinary course of

     Company or any Company Subsidiary are required to pay as contributions
     thereto or (E) fail to file, on a timely basis, all reports and forms
     required by federal regulations with respect to any Employee Plan; or

          (xvi) other than the consummation of the Merger, take any action that
     would cause adjustment to the conversion price of the Preferred Shares.

     No Solicitation.  The Company has agreed in the Merger Agreement that, from
the date of the Merger Agreement until its termination, the Company and the
Company Subsidiaries will not and will not authorize their respective officers,
directors, employees or other agents to, directly or indirectly, (i) take any
action to solicit, initiate or encourage any offer or proposal for, or any
indication of interest in, a merger or other business combination directly or
indirectly involving the Company or any Company Subsidiary or the acquisition of
a substantial equity interest in, or a substantial portion of the assets of, any
such party, other than transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement (an
"Acquisition Proposal") or (ii) engage in negotiations with, or disclose any
nonpublic information relating to the Company or the Company Subsidiaries,
respectively, or afford access to their respective properties, books or records
to any Person that may be considering making, or has made, an Acquisition
Proposal. Nothing contained in this provision shall prohibit the Company and its
Board of Directors from (i) taking and disclosing a position with respect to a
tender offer by a third party pursuant to Rules 14d-9 and 14e-2(a) promulgated
by the Commission under the Exchange Act, or (ii) furnishing information,
including without limitation nonpublic information to, or entering into
negotiations with any Person that has indicated its willingness to make an
unsolicited bona fide Acquisition Proposal, if, and only to the extent that, (A)
such unsolicited bona fide Acquisition Proposal is made by a third party that
the Board of Directors of the Company determines in good faith has the good
faith intent to proceed with negotiations or consider, and financial and other
capability to consummate, such Acquisition Proposal (taking into account among
other things the legal, financial, regulatory and other aspects of such
Acquisition Proposal and the Person making such Acquisition Proposal), (B) the
Board of Directors of the Company, after consultation with outside legal counsel
to the Company, determines in good faith that such action is required for the
Board of Directors of the Company to comply with its fiduciary duties to
stockholders imposed by applicable law, (C) contemporaneously with furnishing
such information to, or entering into discussions or negotiations with, such
Person, the Company provides written notice to Parent to the effect that it is
furnishing information to, or entering into discussions or negotiations with,
such Person and (D) the Company uses all reasonable efforts to keep Parent
informed in all material respects of the status and terms of any such
negotiations or discussions (including without limitation the identity of the
Person with whom such negotiations or discussions are being held) and provides
Parent copies of such written proposals and any amendments or revisions thereto
or correspondence related thereto. The Company, the Company Subsidiaries, and
their respective officers, directors, employees or other agents shall
immediately cease any existing discussions or negotiations, if any, with any
Persons conducted prior to the date of the Merger Agreement with respect to any
Acquisition Proposal.

     Expenses.  Except as set forth below under "Effect of Termination;
Termination Fee," all Expenses (as defined in the Merger Agreement) incurred by
the parties to the Merger Agreement shall be borne solely and entirely by the
party that has incurred such Expenses; provided, however, that if the Merger
Agreement is terminated for any reason, then the allocable share of Parent and
the Company for all Expenses (including any fees and expenses of accountants,
experts, and consultants, but excluding the fees and expenses of legal counsel
and investment bankers) related to preparing, printing, filing and mailing the
Offer Documents, the Proxy Statement and all SEC and other regulatory filing
fees incurred in connection with the Offer Documents and the Proxy Statement
shall be allocated one-half each.

     Indemnification.  For six years after the Effective Time, Parent and the
Surviving Corporation shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless each person who
is now, or has been at any time prior to the date hereof, or who becomes prior
to the Effective Time, an officer or director of the Company or any

Company Subsidiary (each, an "Indemnified Party") against all losses, claims,
damages, liabilities, fees and expenses (including reasonable fees and
disbursements of counsel and judgments, fines, losses, claims, liabilities and
amounts paid in settlement (provided that any such settlement is effected with
the prior written consent of the Surviving Corporation, which consent will not
be unreasonably withheld)) arising in whole or in part out of actions or
omissions in their capacity as such occurring at or prior to the Effective Time
to the fullest extent permitted under Nevada law and the Surviving Corporation's
Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws and the Company's written indemnification
agreements in effect on the date of the Merger Agreement and listed in the
Disclosure Letter, including provisions therein relating to the advancement of
expenses incurred in the defense of any action or suit; provided, that in the
event any claim or claims are asserted or made within such six-year period, all
rights to indemnification in respect of any such claim or claims shall continue
until disposition of any and all such claims, provided that in no event shall
the liability of Parent and the Surviving Corporation in the aggregate under
this provision exceed $115 million.

     The Surviving Corporation shall also maintain the Company's existing
officers' and directors' liability insurance policy ("D&O Insurance") for a
period of not less than six years after the Effective Time, but only to the
extent related to actions or omissions prior to the Effective Time. The
Surviving Corporation has the option to substitute for the existing D&O
Insurance policies of substantially similar coverage and amounts containing
terms no less advantageous to such former directors or officers, provided that
the annual premiums to be paid with respect to the maintenance of such D&O
Insurance during such six-year period shall not exceed two hundred percent
(200%) of the premium paid by the Company for such D&O Insurance during the year
ended December 31, 2000, it being agreed and understood that if such policies
cannot be obtained at such cost, Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to
obtain as much of such policies as can be obtained at a cost equal to such
amount.

     The Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation and
its subsidiaries shall contain provisions no less favorable with respect to
indemnification than are currently set forth in the Bylaws of the Company and
any Company Subsidiary, which provisions shall not be amended, repealed or
otherwise modified for a period of six years from the Effective Time in any
manner that would affect adversely the rights thereunder of individuals who, at
or prior to the Effective Time, were Indemnified Parties, unless such
modification shall be required by Law. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the
Surviving Corporation shall not be obligated to maintain the provisions of the
Company's and the Company's Subsidiaries' Bylaws and Articles of Incorporation
that provide for indemnification of directors and officers in their capacities
as stockholders.

     Conditions Precedent.  The obligations of the Company, Parent and us to
consummate the Merger are subject to the satisfaction or waiver, in whole or in
part (where permissible by applicable law), at or prior to the closing of the
Merger, of each of the following conditions: (a) no Governmental Authority or
court of competent jurisdiction located or having jurisdiction in the United
States shall have enacted, issued, promulgated, enforced or entered any Laws or
Governmental Order which is then in effect making the consummation of the Merger
illegal or otherwise prohibit the consummation of the Merger; (b) if required by
applicable law in order to consummate the Merger the Company Stockholders'
Approval shall have been obtained, (c) Parent, us or our Affiliates shall have
purchased Shares pursuant to the Offer; and (d) all approvals of Governmental
Authorities necessary to consummate the Merger and other transactions
contemplated therein shall have been received and shall be in effect at the
Effective Time.

     Termination.  The Merger Agreement provides that it may be terminated and
the Merger may be abandoned at any time prior to the Effective Time, whether
before or after approval by the Company's stockholders:

          (i) by the mutual written consent of Parent and the Company;

          (ii) by either Parent or the Company if the Effective Time shall not
     have occurred on or before May 31, 2001; provided that the party seeking to
     terminate the Merger Agreement shall not have breached in any material
     respect its obligations under the Merger Agreement in any manner that shall
     have proximately contributed to the failure to consummate the Merger on or
     before May 31, 2001;

          (iii) by the Company if there has been a material breach by us or
     Parent of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement set forth in
     the Merger Agreement which breach (if susceptible to cure) has not been
     cured in all material respects within five business days following receipt
     by us or Parent of notice of such breach;

          (iv) by either Parent or the Company if any court of competent
     jurisdiction or other Governmental Authority shall have issued an order,
     decree or ruling or taken any other action permanently enjoining,
     restraining or otherwise prohibiting the acceptance for payment of, or
     payment for, the Common Shares or Preferred Shares pursuant to the Offer or
     the Merger and such order, decree or ruling or other action shall have
     become final and nonappealable, provided that the party seeking to
     terminate the Merger Agreement shall have used its reasonable best efforts
     to remove or lift such order, decree or ruling;

          (v) by Parent, if (i) the Board of Directors of the Company (A)
     withdraws, modifies or changes (including by amendment of the Schedule
     14D-9) its recommendation of the Offer, the Merger Agreement or the Merger
     in a manner adverse to Parent or shall have resolved to do any of the
     foregoing, (B) shall have recommended to the stockholders of the Company
     any Acquisition Proposal or resolved to do so or (C) shall have failed to
     reaffirm publicly and unconditionally its recommendation to the Company's
     stockholders that they tender their Shares in the Offer, which public
     reaffirmation must be made within five days after Parent's written request
     to do so; or (ii) the Minimum Condition shall not have been satisfied by
     the Expiration Date and (A) a third party shall have made or caused to be
     made an Acquisition Proposal, or (B) any "group" (as defined in Section
     13(d)(3) of the Exchange Act) or Person (including the Company or any of
     its Affiliates), other than Parent or any of its Affiliates, shall have
     become the beneficial owner of more than 50% of the Common Shares or 50% of
     the Preferred Shares; provided, however, the current ownership of Shares by
     the Company's stockholders who are party to either the Tender Agreement or
     the Tender and Voting Agreement shall not be deemed to trigger this clause
     (B);

          (vi) by the Company, if, prior to the acceptance of and payment for
     the Shares pursuant to the Offer, the Company's Board of Directors shall
     have determined to recommend a Superior Proposal and the Company makes the
     payment of the Termination Fee and Expense Fee (each as defined below) as
     required under the Merger Agreement. For purposes of the Merger Agreement,
     "Superior Proposal" means an unsolicited bona fide proposal made by a third
     party relating to an Acquisition Proposal on terms that the Board of
     Directors of the Company determines it cannot reject in favor of the Offer
     and the Merger, based on applicable fiduciary duties and after consultation
     with the Company's outside counsel (taking into account among other things
     the legal, financial, regulatory and other aspects of the Acquisition
     Proposal, the Person making such Acquisition Proposal, the likelihood of
     consummation and the time required to complete such transaction); provided,
     however, that the Company shall not be permitted to terminate the Merger
     Agreement pursuant to this provision unless it has complied with Section
     6.08 of the Merger Agreement (relating to non-solicitation) and used all
     reasonable efforts to provide Parent with two business days prior written
     notice of its intent to so terminate the Merger Agreement together with a
     detailed summary of the terms and conditions of such Acquisition Proposal;
     provided further, that prior to any such termination, the Company shall,
     and shall cause its respective financial and legal advisors to, negotiate
     in good faith with Parent to make such adjustments in the terms and
     conditions of the Merger Agreement as would enable the Company to proceed
     with the transactions contemplated herein, and it is acknowledged by Parent
     that such negotiations with Parent shall be conducted in a manner
     consistent with the fiduciary duties of the Company's Board of Directors;

          (vii) by the Company if (i) we fail to commence the Offer in violation
     of the Merger Agreement (relating to the Offer), provided, however, that
     the Company may not terminate the Merger Agreement pursuant to this
     provision if the Company has materially breached the Merger Agreement, or
     (ii) we fail to purchase validly tendered Shares in violation of the terms
     of the Merger Agreement;

          (viii) by Parent or the Company if the Offer is terminated or
     withdrawn or shall have expired pursuant to its terms without any Shares
     being purchased thereunder; provided, however, that neither Parent nor the
     Company may terminate the Merger Agreement pursuant to this provision if
     such party (or in the case of Parent, we) shall have materially breached
     the Agreement; or

          (ix) by Parent if the Company shall have breached any of its
     representations or warranties in the Merger Agreement which breach would
     give rise to the failure of the condition set forth in clause (e) of the
     conditions of the Offer (see Section 14 -- "Certain Conditions to Our
     Obligations") to be satisfied or if, prior to consummation of the Offer,
     the Company shall have failed to perform its covenants or other agreements
     contained in the Merger Agreement which failure to perform would give rise
     to the failure of the condition set forth in clause (e) of the conditions
     of the Offer (see Section 14 -- "Certain Conditions to Our Obligations") to
     be satisfied, which breach or failure to perform is incapable of being
     cured or has not been cured by the date that is five business days
     following written notice thereof to the Company from Parent.

     Effect of Termination; Termination Fee.  In the event of termination of the
Merger Agreement pursuant to the above provisions, all obligations of the
parties shall terminate, except the obligations of the parties pursuant to
certain provisions of the Merger Agreement, provided that nothing shall relieve
any party from liability for any breaches of the Merger Agreement. In the event
that the Merger Agreement is terminated pursuant to clause (v)(i) under
"Termination" above (other than clause (v)(i)(A) if no Acquisition Proposal
shall have been publicly announced or disclosed) or clause (vi) under
"Termination" above, then the Company shall promptly (and in any event within
one Business Day after such termination or, in the case of any such termination
by the Company, prior to such termination) pay Parent an amount equal to (i) a
termination fee of $5,200,000 (the "Termination Fee"), provided, however, that
in no event shall more than one Termination Fee be payable by the Company plus
(ii) Parent's aggregate Expenses up to $500,000 (the "Expense Fee"). In the
event that the Merger Agreement is terminated pursuant to clause (v)(i)(A) under
"Termination" above (if no Acquisition Proposal shall have been publicly
announced or disclosed) and within 12 months of the date of termination of the
Merger Agreement a transaction constituting an Acquisition Proposal is
consummated, the Company shall, prior to or simultaneously with the consummation
of such transaction, pay Parent the Termination Fee and the Expense Fee. In the
event that the Merger Agreement is terminated pursuant to clause (v)(ii) hereof
and within 12 months of the date of termination of the Merger Agreement either
(A) a transaction constituting an Acquisition Proposal is consummated or (B) any
"group" (as defined in Section 13(d)(3) of the Exchange Act) or Person
(including the Company or any of its Affiliates), other than Parent or any of
its Affiliates, shall have become the beneficial owner of more than 50% of the
Common Shares or 50% of the Preferred Shares, the Company shall, prior to or
simultaneously with the consummation of such transaction or the acquisition of
such Common Shares or Preferred Shares, pay Parent the Termination Fee and the
Expense Fee; provided, however, the current ownership of Shares by the Company's
stockholders who are party to either the Tender Agreement or the Tender and
Voting Agreement shall not be deemed to trigger this clause (B); and provided
further that the acquisition of additional Preferred Shares by any of the
current holders of Preferred Shares by virtue of a transfer or purchase of such
Preferred Shares from another current holder of Preferred Shares shall not be
deemed to trigger this clause (B). In no event shall the Company be obligated to
pay more than one Termination Fee and Expense Fee pursuant to this provision of
the Merger Agreement.

     Amendment.  The Merger Agreement may not be amended or modified except (a)
by an instrument in writing signed by each of, or on behalf of each of, the
parties or (b) by a waiver in accordance with the waiver provisions of the
Merger Agreement.

except following termination of the Offer pursuant to its terms. Any Preferred

include all rights associated with such Shares, including but not limited to all
cash and non-cash dividends, distributions, rights, other Shares or other
securities issued, paid or distributed, issuable, payable or distributable in
respect thereof on or after the date of the Tender and Voting Agreement
(including without limitation, with respect to the Preferred Shares, rights to
dividends pursuant to Section 4.17 of the Preferred Stock Purchase Agreement).
Each Selling Stockholder has agreed and acknowledged that it will have no rights
to dividends on its Preferred Shares payable on or at any time subsequent to the
purchase of such Preferred Shares pursuant to the Offer.

     Voting Agreement.  During the time the Tender and Voting Agreement is in
effect, each Selling Stockholder has agreed (severally and not jointly) that at
any meeting of the stockholders of the Company, however called, or in any other
circumstance in which the vote, consent or approval of stockholders of the
Company is sought, such Selling Stockholder shall (i) vote the Tender Shares to
approve and vote in favor of the Merger Agreement; (ii) vote the Tender Shares
against any action or agreement that would result in a breach of any covenant,
representation or warranty or any other obligation or agreement of the Company

or agreement (other than the Merger Agreement or the transactions contemplated
thereby) that would impede, interfere with, delay, postpone or attempt to
discourage the Merger or the Offer, including, but not limited to: (1) any
extraordinary corporate transaction, such as a merger, consolidation or other
business combination involving the Company or any of its subsidiaries; (2) a
sale or transfer of a material amount of assets of the Company or any of the
Company Subsidiaries or a reorganization, recapitalization or liquidation of the
Company and the Company Subsidiaries; (3) any change in the management or board
of directors of the Company, except as otherwise agreed to in writing by
Purchaser; (4) any material change in the present capitalization or dividend
policy of the Company; or (5) any other material change in the Company's
corporate structure or business.

     Grant of Irrevocable Proxy.  Each Selling Stockholder has irrevocably
granted to, and appointed Parent such Selling Stockholder's proxy and
attorney-in-fact (with full power of substitution), for and in the name, place
and stead of such Selling Stockholder, to vote the Tender Shares to approve and
vote in favor of the Offer, the Merger Agreement and the transactions
contemplated by the Merger Agreement, against any Acquisition Proposal and
otherwise as contemplated by the provisions of the Tender and Voting Agreement
relating to voting.

     No Disposition of Selling Stockholders' Shares and No Acquisition of
Shares.  Each Selling Stockholder severally (and not jointly) covenants and
agrees that, except as contemplated by the Tender and Voting Agreement and the
Merger Agreement, such Selling Stockholder will not (i) except to us, transfer
(which term shall include, without limitation, any sale, gift, pledge or other
disposition), or consent to any transfer of, any or all of the Company Options,
Company Warrants or Tender Shares or any interest therein, (ii) except with
Parent, enter into any contract, option or other agreement or understanding with
respect to any transfer of any or all of the Company Options, Company Warrants
or Tender Shares or any interest therein, (iii) grant any proxy,

Options, Company Warrants or Tender Shares, (iv) deposit any Company Options,
Company Warrants or Tender Shares into a voting trust or enter into a voting
agreement or arrangement with respect to the Tender Shares, (v) with respect to
any Selling Stockholder that is a holder of Preferred Shares, (A) elect, under
Section 3(C) of the Designation of Preferences, Limitations and Rights of Series
A Convertible Preferred Stock of the Company (the "Designation"), to have the
Offer or Merger or any of the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby
treated as a Liquidation (as defined in the Designation) or (B) convert any
Preferred Shares held by such Selling Stockholder into any other series or class
of securities of the Company or (vi) take any other action that would in any way
restrict, limit or interfere with the performance of its obligations hereunder
or the transactions contemplated hereby or by the Merger Agreement or which
would make any representation or warranty of such Selling Stockholder hereunder
untrue or incorrect.

     No Solicitation.  Each Selling Stockholder severally (and not jointly) has
agreed that it shall not, and shall not permit or authorize any of its
affiliates, representatives or agents to, directly or indirectly, encourage,
solicit, explore, participate in or initiate discussions or negotiations with,
or provide or disclose any information to, any Person or group (other than
Parent, us or any of our affiliates or representatives) concerning any
Acquisition Proposal or enter into any agreement, arrangement or understanding
requiring the Company to abandon, terminate or fail to consummate the Offer, the
Merger or any other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement. Each
Stockholder has also agreed to immediately cease any existing activities,
discussions or negotiations with any parties conducted prior to the execution of
the Tender and Voting Agreement with respect to any Acquisition Proposal. From
and after the execution of the Tender and Voting Agreement, each Stockholder
shall immediately advise Parent in writing of the receipt, directly or
indirectly, of any inquiries, discussions, negotiations or proposals relating to
an Acquisition Proposal, identify the offeror and furnish to Parent a copy of
any such proposal or inquiry, if it is in writing, or a written summary of any
oral proposal or inquiry relating to an Acquisition Proposal. Such Selling
Stockholder shall promptly advise Parent in writing of any development relating
to such proposal, including the results of any discussions or negotiations with
respect thereto. Any action taken by the Company or any member of the Board of
Directors of the Company including, if applicable, any representative of any
Selling Stockholder acting in such capacity, in accordance with the second
sentence of Section 6.08 of the Merger Agreement (relating to non-solicitation)
shall be deemed not to violate this provision of the Tender and Voting
Agreement.

     Waiver of Appraisal Rights.  Each Stockholder has waived any rights of
appraisal or rights to dissent from the Merger that it may have.

     Payment for Tender Shares in Excess of the Common Share Offer Price or the
Preferred Share Offer Price.  Each Selling Stockholder has severally (and not
jointly) agreed that, if the Merger Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section
8.01(e) or (f) of the Merger Agreement, fifty percent (50%) of any incremental
value such Stockholder actually receives for its equity in the Company
(including but not limited to any Shares, Company Options and Company Warrants
beneficially owned by such Stockholder)

resulting from or attributable to an Acquisition Proposal (other than with us or
Parent) that is entered into or consummated within six months of the termination
of the Merger Agreement that exceeds $8.25 per Common Share or $18.04 per
Preferred Share (100% of such excess amount with respect to the Common Shares,
Company Options, Company Warrants and the Preferred Shares, as applicable,
collectively referred to as the "Excess Amount") shall belong to Parent. Each
Selling Stockholder severally (and not jointly) accordingly agrees to hold in
trust for the benefit of Parent, and to remit to Parent (in the same form of
consideration as received by Stockholder) within three business days of any
receipt thereof, fifty percent (50%) of any Excess Amount or Amounts that such
Stockholder actually receives from any Person.

     Transfer of Options and Warrants.  The Tender and Voting Agreement also
provides that each Selling Stockholder holding Company Options or Company
Warrants has agreed severally (and not jointly) that so long as the Tender and
Voting Agreement remains in effect, such Selling Stockholder (for purposes of
this section an "Optionholder") will not transfer or exercise any Company
Options or Company Warrants held by such Optionholder except to an Affiliate of
such Stockholder that becomes a party to the Tender and Voting Agreement or a
similar agreement; provided, however, that at the Effective Time each
Optionholder has agreed to accept an amount in respect of such Company Options
equal to the Company Option Payments, and each such Company Option will
thereafter be cancelled; and an amount in respect of such Company Warrants equal
to the Company Warrant Payments, and each such Company Warrant will thereafter
be cancelled. Nothing in the Tender and Voting Agreement will limit the ability
of the holders of the Company Options or Company Warrants to exercise such
securities in accordance with their terms, provided that such holder tenders the
Common Shares issued upon exercise thereof in the Offer.

     Waiver of Certain Put Rights.  Certain Selling Stockholders of the Company,
Energy Capital Investment Company, PLC, EnCap Equity 1996 Limited Partnership,
and First Union Capital Partners, Inc., have the right to require the Company to
repurchase certain securities of the Company pursuant to agreements with the
Company. Subject to the termination provisions of the Voting and Tender
Agreement, such Selling Stockholders have waived such put rights.

     Waiver of Management Rights.  One of the Selling Stockholders, V&C Energy
Limited Partnership, who may have certain special rights relating to the
management and future activities of the Company and its Affiliates (the
"Management Rights"), including but not limited to the right to participate in
acquisitions and dispositions of the Company, its Affiliates, and of various
assets, interests or other properties by the Company or its Affiliates, has,
subject to the termination provisions of the Voting and Tender Agreement,
irrevocably waived the Management Rights and agreed that neither Parent, us nor
the Surviving Corporation will have any continuing obligation to such
stockholder with respect to such Management Rights or any similar special right
to control or effect the affairs or activities of the Surviving Corporation or
its Affiliates.

     Representations and Warranties.  The Tender and Voting Agreement contains
customary representations and warranties by each Selling Stockholder severally
(and not jointly) to Parent and us, including those relating to (i) the
ownership and title to Shares, and the absence of liens or encumbrances, (ii)
authority to enter into and perform obligations under the Tender and Voting
Agreement, (iii) noncontravention and enforceability, and (iv) the absence of
finder's fees.

TENDER AGREEMENT

     As a condition of our willingness to enter into the Merger Agreement, we
required that each of the Selling Stockholders set forth therein enter into the
Tender Agreement. Such Selling Stockholders beneficially own an aggregate of
300,779 outstanding Common Shares and 190,460 outstanding Preferred Shares
(representing approximately 3.7% of the Common Shares and 6.4% of the Preferred
Shares outstanding on January 18, 2001, on a fully diluted basis). In addition,
as of January 18, 2001, such Selling Stockholders own Company Options
exercisable for an aggregate of 242,200 Common Shares. The provisions of the
Tender Agreement are substantially similar to the terms and conditions of the
Tender and

Voting Agreement, except that the Selling Stockholders party to the Tender
Agreement make no representations or agreements regarding the voting of, or the
granting of an irrevocable proxy in connection with the voting of, the Tender
Shares in favor of the Offer, the Merger and other transactions. The following

CONFIDENTIALITY AGREEMENTS

     On October 30, 2000, Parent and the Company entered into a Confidentiality
Agreement (the "October Confidentiality Agreement") pursuant to which the
Company agreed to supply certain information to Parent and Parent agreed to
treat such information as confidential and to use such information solely in
connection with the evaluation of a possible transaction with the Company.
Parent and the Company entered into an additional Confidentiality Agreement
dated December 18, 2000 (together with the October Confidentiality Agreement,
the "Confidentiality Agreements,"), pursuant to which Parent agreed to supply
certain information to the Company and the Company agreed to treat such
information as confidential and to use such information solely in connection
with the evaluation of a possible transaction with Parent.

     Under the Merger Agreement, Parent and the Company agreed to hold in
confidence all nonpublic information until such time as such information is
otherwise publicly available. If the Merger Agreement is terminated, each party
will deliver to the other all documents, work papers and other materials
(including copies) obtained by such party or on its behalf from the other party
as a result of the Merger Agreement or in connection with the Merger Agreement,
whether so obtained before or after the execution of the Merger Agreement.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Confidentiality Agreements shall survive the
execution and delivery of this Agreement.

     14. CERTAIN CONDITIONS TO OUR OBLIGATIONS.  Notwithstanding any other
provisions of the Offer, we shall not be required to accept for payment or,
subject to any applicable rules and regulations of the Commission, including
Rule 14e-1(c) under the Exchange Act (relating to our obligation to pay for or
return tendered Shares after the termination or withdrawal of the Offer), pay
for any tendered Shares and, subject to the terms of the Merger Agreement, may
terminate or amend the Offer, if (i) the Minimum Condition has not been
satisfied, or (ii) at any time on or after the date of the Merger Agreement and
prior to the time of payment for any Shares any of the following conditions
shall exist or be determined by us to have occurred:

     government, governmental, regulatory or administrative authority, agency or
     commission or any court, tribunal, or judicial or arbitral body (each, a
     "Governmental Authority") that could reasonably be expected to directly or
     indirectly: (1) make the acceptance for payment of, or payment for or
     purchase of all or a substantial number of the Shares pursuant to the
     Offer, illegal, or otherwise restrict or prohibit the making of the Offer
     or the consummation of the Offer or the Merger, (2) result in a significant

     on the ability of Parent or us effectively to control the business or

     defined below); or

          (b)(i) there shall be instituted or pending any action, proceeding or
     counterclaim seeking any of the consequences referred to in clauses (1)

     threatened any action, proceeding or counterclaim seeking any of the

     amendment of the Schedule 14D-9) its recommendation of the Offer, the
     Merger Agreement or the Merger in a manner adverse to Parent, (B) shall
     have recommended to the stockholders of the Company any Acquisition
     Proposal, or (C) shall have failed to reaffirm publicly and unconditionally

     Shares in the Offer, which public reaffirmation must be made within five
     days after Parent's written request to do so, (iii) a third party shall
     have entered into a definitive agreement or a written agreement in
     principle with the Company with respect to an Acquisition Proposal, or (iv)
     the Board of Directors of the Company or any committee thereof shall have
     resolved to do any of the foregoing; or

          (d) the Merger Agreement shall have been terminated in accordance with
     its terms, or the Company and we and Parent shall have reached an agreement
     that the Offer or the Merger Agreement be terminated; or

          (e)(i) any of the representations and warranties of the Company set
     forth in Sections 4.02 and 4.03 of the Merger Agreement (relating to
     capitalization and Company subsidiaries, respectively) shall not be true
     and correct as if such representations and warranties were made at the time
     of such determination (except as to any such representation or warranty
     that speaks as of a specific date, which must be untrue or incorrect as of
     such date); (ii) the representations and warranties of the Company set
     forth in Section 4.16 of the Merger Agreement (relating to environmental
     matters) shall not be true and correct as if such representations and
     warranties were made at the time of such determination and the cost of
     correcting the breach of such representations and warranties shall be in
     excess of $6.0 million in the aggregate; (iii) any of the other
     representations and warranties of the Company set forth in the Merger
     Agreement, when read without any exception or qualification as to
     materiality or reference to Material Adverse Effect, shall not be true and
     correct as if such representations and warranties were made at the time of
     such determination (except as to any such representation and warranty which
     speaks as of a specific date, which must be untrue or incorrect as of such
     date) except where the failure to be so true and correct would not
     individually or in the aggregate reasonably be expected to have a Material
     Adverse Effect or (iv) the Company shall have breached or failed to observe
     or perform in any material respect any of its material covenants under

     the Merger Agreement, which breach has not been cured in all material
     respects within five business days following receipt by the Company of
     written notice of such breach; or

          (f) any approvals or consents (other than the filing of a certificate
     of merger or approval by the stockholders of the Company of the Merger if
     required by the Nevada Revised Statutes) required to be filed, or obtained
     by the Company or any of its subsidiaries in connection with the execution
     and delivery of the Merger Agreement, the Offer and the consummation of the
     transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement shall not have been filed
     or obtained except where the failure to obtain such approval or consent
     would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect; or

          (g) there shall have occurred, and continued to exist, (1) any general
     suspension of, or limitation on prices for, trading in securities on the
     Nasdaq Small-Cap Market, (2) a declaration of a banking moratorium or any
     suspension of payments in respect of banks in the United States, or a
     material limitation (whether or not mandatory) by any Governmental
     Authority on the extension of credit by banks or other lending
     institutions, or (3) in the case of any of the foregoing clauses existing
     at the time of the commencement of the Offer, a material acceleration or
     worsening thereof; or

          (h) since the date of the Merger Agreement there shall have occurred
     any event, change, effect or development that, individually or when
     considered together with any other event, change, effect or development,
     has had or would have a Material Adverse Effect; or

          (i) There shall exist any Material Title Failure (as defined in the
     Merger Agreement) having a value in excess of $6.0 million.

     The foregoing conditions (including those set forth in clauses (i), (ii)
and (iii) of the initial paragraph) are for our benefit and the benefit of
Parent and may be asserted by us or by Parent regardless of the circumstances
giving rise to any such conditions and other than clauses (i) and (ii) may be
waived by us or Parent, in whole or in part, at any time and from time to time
in their reasonable discretion, in each case, subject to the terms of the Merger
Agreement. The conditions in clauses (i) and (ii) of the initial paragraph may
not be waived without the written consent of the Company. The failure by us or
Parent at any time to exercise any of the foregoing rights shall not be deemed a
waiver of any such right and each such right shall be deemed an ongoing right
which may be asserted at any time and from time to time.

     A "Parent Material Adverse Effect" means any event, circumstance,
condition, development or occurrence causing, resulting in or having (or with
the passage of time likely to cause, result in or have) a material adverse
effect on the financial condition, business, assets, properties, or results of
operations of Parent and Parent's subsidiaries taken as a whole; provided, that
such term shall not include effects that are not applicable primarily to Parent
resulting from market conditions generally in the oil and gas industry
(including without limitation changes in commodities prices).

     15. CERTAIN LEGAL MATTERS.

     General.  Except as set forth in this Section 15, we are not aware of any
approval or other action by any governmental or administrative agency which
would be required for the acquisition or ownership of Shares as contemplated
herein. Should any such approval or other action be required, it will be sought,
but we have no current intention to delay the purchase of Shares tendered
pursuant to the Offer pending the outcome of any such matter, subject, however,
to our right to decline to purchase Shares if any of the conditions specified in
Section 14 -- "Certain Conditions to Our Obligations" shall have occurred. There
can be no assurance that any such approval or other action, if needed, would be
obtained or would be obtained without substantial conditions, or that adverse
consequences might not result to the Company's business or that certain parts of
the Company's business might not have to be disposed of if any such approvals
were not obtained or other action taken.

     Appraisal Rights.  Appraisal rights are not available in connection with
the Offer. Shares outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and which
are (i) held by holders of Shares who shall have not voted in favor of the
Merger or consented to the Merger in writing and (ii) who shall have demanded

properly in writing payment of the fair market value of such Shares in
accordance with Section 92A.420 of the Nevada Revised Statutes (collectively,
the "Dissenting Shares") shall be cancelled and terminated and shall represent
solely the right to receive payment from the Surviving Corporation of the fair
market value of such Shares held by them in accordance with the provisions of
the Nevada Revised Statutes. Such rights to dissent, if the statutory procedures
are complied with, could lead to a judicial determination of the fair value of
the Dissenting Shares immediately before the effectuation of the Merger
(excluding any appreciation or depreciation in anticipation of the Merger unless
exclusion would be inequitable), required to be paid in cash to such dissenting
holders for their Shares. In addition, such dissenting stockholders would be
entitled to receive payment of interest from the date of consummation of the
Merger on the amount determined to be the fair value of their Dissenting Shares
at the average rate currently paid by the Company on its principal bank loans
or, if it has no bank loans, at the rate that is fair and equitable under all of
the circumstances.

     However, holders of Shares who shall have failed to perfect or who
effectively shall have withdrawn or lost their rights for an appraisal of such
shares under the Nevada Revised Statutes shall thereupon have such shares be
deemed to have been cancelled and terminated, as of the Effective Time, and
shall represent solely the right to receive the Common Share Offer Price or the
Preferred Share Offer Price as provided in Section 3.06 of the Merger Agreement,
as applicable, upon surrender of the certificate or certificates that formerly
evidenced such Shares in the manner provided in Section 3.07 of the Merger
Agreement.

     The Company will give to Parent (i) prompt notice of any demands for
appraisal received by the Company, withdrawals of such demands, and any other
instruments served pursuant to the Nevada Revised Statutes and received by the
Company and (ii) the opportunity to direct all negotiations and proceedings with
respect to demands for payment of fair market value under the Nevada Revised
Statutes. The Company shall not, except with the prior written consent of
Parent, make any payment with respect to any such demands, or offer to settle,
or settle, any such demands. Any amount payable to any holder of Shares
exercising dissenters' rights shall be paid solely by the Surviving Corporation
out of its own funds.

     Nevada State Takeover Laws.  Chapter 78 of the Nevada Revised Statutes
contains two separate "anti-takeover" statutory provisions: the "Acquisition of
Controlling Interest" statutes (NRS 78.378 through 78.3793, inclusive) and the
"Combinations with Interested Stockholders" statutes (NRS 78.411 through 78.444,
inclusive).

     The Acquisition of Controlling Interests statutes generally provide that
"control shares" of an "issuing corporation" acquired by any "acquiring person"
shall have voting rights in those "control shares" only to the extent conferred
by a vote of the stockholders of the issuing corporation. An "issuing
corporation" is a corporation that is organized under the laws of Nevada, has
200 or more stockholders of record, at least 100 of whom have addresses in
Nevada appearing on the stock ledger of the corporation, and does business in
Nevada directly or through an affiliated corporation. The Acquisition of
Controlling Interests statutes do not apply if the Articles of Incorporation or
Bylaws of the issuing corporation in effect on the tenth day following the
acquisition of a controlling interest by an acquiring person provide that said
provisions do not apply. The Company, pursuant to the Merger Agreement, amended
its Bylaws to provide that the provisions of the Acquisition of Controlling
Interest statutes do not apply to the Company.

     The Combinations with Interested Stockholders statutes generally prohibit
the merger of a "resident domestic corporation" (i.e., a Nevada corporation that
has 200 or more stockholders of record) with an "interested stockholder" for a
three-year period unless the board of directors approves such stockholder's
"acquisition" of shares in advance. One becomes an "interested stockholder" of a
corporation by beneficially owning, directly or indirectly, ten percent (10%) or
more of the voting power of the outstanding voting shares of that corporation.
Pursuant to NRS 78.414(3), a person or entity (and its affiliates and
associates) will be considered a "beneficial owner" of shares beneficially owned
by another person or entity if there is any written or other agreement,
arrangement, or understanding for the purpose of acquiring, holding, voting, or
disposing of the shares. However, the prohibitions of the Combinations with
Interested Stockholders Statutes do not apply to the Offer, the Merger
Agreement, the Tender and

Voting Agreement or the Tender Agreement or the transactions contemplated
thereby, since the Company's board of directors has approved the Offer, the
Merger, the Tender and Voting Agreement and the Tender Agreement, and the
transactions contemplated thereby prior to the date of such agreements and the
commencement of the Offer.

     Other State Takeover Laws.  A number of other states have adopted laws and
regulations applicable to attempts to acquire securities of corporations which
are incorporated, or have substantial assets, stockholders, principal executive
offices or principal places of business, or whose business operations otherwise
have substantial economic effects, in such states. In Edgar v. MITE Corp., in
l982, the Supreme Court of the United States (the "U.S. Supreme Court")
invalidated on constitutional grounds the Illinois Business Takeover statute,
which, as a matter of state securities law, made takeovers of corporations
meeting certain requirements more difficult. However, in 1987, in CTS Corp. v.
Dynamics Corp. of America, the U.S. Supreme Court held that the State of Indiana
may, as a matter of corporate law and, in particular, with respect to those
aspects of corporate governance, constitutionally disqualify a potential
acquiror from voting on the affairs of a target corporation without the prior
approval of the remaining stockholders. The state law before the U.S. Supreme
Court was by its terms applicable only to corporations that had a substantial
number of stockholders in the state and were incorporated there. Subsequently, a
number of federal courts have ruled that various state takeover statutes were
unconstitutional insofar as they apply to corporations incorporated outside the
state of enactment.

     The Company conducts business in a number of states throughout the United
States, some of which have enacted takeover laws. We do not know whether any of
these laws will, by their terms, apply to the Offer or the Merger and we have
not attempted to comply with any such laws. Should any person seek to apply any
state takeover law, we will take such action as then appears desirable, which
may include challenging the validity or applicability of any such statute in
appropriate court proceedings. In the event it is asserted that one or more
state takeover laws is applicable to the Offer or the Merger, and an appropriate
court does not determine that such laws are inapplicable or invalid as applied
to the Offer, we might be required to file certain information with, or receive
approvals from, the relevant state authorities. In addition, if enjoined, we
might be unable to accept for payment any Shares tendered pursuant to the Offer,
or be delayed in continuing or consummating the Offer and the Merger. In such
case, we may not be obligated to accept for payment any Shares tendered. See
Section 14 -- "Certain Conditions to Our Obligations."

     Antitrust.  Under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976,
as amended, and the rules that have been promulgated thereunder by the Federal
Trade Commission (the "FTC"), certain acquisition transactions may not be
consummated unless certain information has been furnished to the Antitrust
Division of the Department of Justice and the FTC and certain waiting period
requirements have been satisfied. The purchase of Shares pursuant to the Offer
and the subsequent Merger are not subject to such requirements.

     16. FEES AND EXPENSES.  Neither we nor Parent, nor any officer, director,
stockholder, agent or other representative of Parent or us, will pay any fees or
commissions to any broker, dealer or other person (other than the Information
Agent) for soliciting tenders of Shares pursuant to the Offer. Brokers, dealers,
commercial banks and trust companies and other nominees will, upon request, be
reimbursed by us for customary mailing and handling expenses incurred by them in
forwarding materials to their customers.

     We have retained Georgeson Shareholder Communications Inc., as Information
Agent, and EquiServe Trust Company, N.A., as Depositary, in connection with the
Offer. The Information Agent and the Depositary will receive reasonable and
customary compensation for their services hereunder and reimbursement for their
reasonable out-of-pocket expenses. The Information Agent and the Depositary will
also be indemnified by us against certain liabilities in connection with the
Offer. The Information Agent may contact holders of Shares by mail, telex,
telegraph and personal interviews and may request brokers, dealers and other
nominee stockholders to forward materials relating to the Offer to beneficial
owners of Shares.

     17. MISCELLANEOUS.  We are not aware nor is Parent aware of any
jurisdiction where the making of the Offer is prohibited by any administrative
or judicial action pursuant to any valid state statute. If either we or Parent
become aware of any valid state statute prohibiting the making of the Offer or
the acceptance of the Common Shares and Preferred Shares, we and Parent will
make a good faith effort to comply with that state statute. If, after a good
faith effort, we and Parent cannot comply with the state statute, the Offer will
not be made to, nor will tenders be accepted from or on behalf of, the holders
of the Common Shares and Preferred Shares in that state.

     NO PERSON HAS BEEN AUTHORIZED TO GIVE ANY INFORMATION OR MAKE ANY
REPRESENTATION ON OUR BEHALF OR ON PARENT'S BEHALF OTHER THAN AS CONTAINED IN
THIS OFFER TO PURCHASE OR IN THE LETTER OF TRANSMITTAL AND, IF ANY SUCH
INFORMATION OR REPRESENTATION IS GIVEN OR MADE, IT SHOULD NOT BE RELIED UPON AS
HAVING BEEN AUTHORIZED.

     We have filed with the Commission a Schedule TO, pursuant to Section
14(d)(1) of the Exchange Act and Rule 14d-3 promulgated thereunder, furnishing
certain information with respect to the Offer. Such Schedule TO, and any
amendments thereto, including exhibits, may be examined and copies may be
obtained at the same places and in the same manner as set forth with respect to
the Company in Section 8 -- "Certain Information Concerning the Company" (except
that they will not be available at the regional offices of the Commission).

Ladies and Gentlemen:

     The undersigned hereby tenders to OEI Acquisition Corp., a Nevada
corporation (the "Offeror") and a wholly-owned subsidiary of Ocean Energy, Inc.,
a Texas corporation (the "Parent"), the above described shares of common stock,
par value $.01 per share (the "Common Stock"), of Texoil, Inc., a Nevada
corporation (the "Company"), pursuant to the Offeror's offer to purchase (a) all
of the outstanding shares of the Company's Common Stock (the "Common Shares"),
at a purchase price of $8.25 per Common Share, net to the seller in cash,
without interest (such price for Common Shares, referred to herein as the
"Common Share Offer Price"), and (b) all of the outstanding shares of the
Company's Series A Convertible Preferred Stock, par value $.01 per share (the
"Preferred Shares"), at a purchase price of $18.04 per Preferred Share, net to
the seller in cash, without interest, upon the terms and subject to the
conditions set forth in the Offer to Purchase, dated January 24, 2001 (the
"Offer to Purchase"), receipt of which is hereby acknowledged, and this Letter
of Transmittal (which, together with any amendments or supplements thereto,
constitute the "Offer").

     Subject to, and effective upon, the acceptance for payment of the Common
Shares tendered herewith, in accordance with the terms and subject to the
conditions of the Offer (including, if the Offer is extended or amended, the
terms and conditions of such extension or amendment), the undersigned hereby
sells, assigns and transfers to, or upon the order of, the Offeror all right,
title and interest in and to all of the Common Shares tendered hereby and all
rights associated with such Common Shares, including but not limited to all cash
and non-cash dividends, distributions, rights, other Common Shares or other
securities issued, paid or distributed or issuable, payable or distributable in
respect thereof on or after January 18, 2001, and prior to the transfer to the
name of the Offeror (or nominee or transferee of the Offeror) on the Company's
stock transfer records of the Common Shares tendered herewith (collectively, a
"Distribution") and irrevocably constitutes and appoints the Depositary as the
true and lawful agent and attorney-in-fact of the undersigned with respect to
such Common Shares (and any Distribution) with full power of substitution (such
power of attorney being deemed to be an irrevocable power coupled with an
interest) to (i) deliver certificates for such Common Shares (and any
Distribution) or transfer ownership of such Common Shares (and any Distribution)
on the account books maintained by the Book-Entry Transfer Facility, together,
in either case, with all accompanying evidences of transfer and authenticity, to
or upon the order of the Offeror, (ii) present such Common Shares (and any
Distribution) for transfer on the books of the Company and (iii) receive all
benefits and otherwise exercise all rights of beneficial ownership of such
Common Shares (and any Distribution), all in accordance with the terms and
subject to the conditions of the Offer.

     The undersigned irrevocably appoints designees of Offeror as such
undersigned's agents, attorneys-in-fact and proxies, with full power of
substitution, to the full extent of the undersigned's rights with respect to the
Common Shares (and any Distribution) tendered by the undersigned and accepted
for payment by Offeror. All such powers of attorney and proxies shall be
considered irrevocable and coupled with an interest. Such appointment will be
effective when, and only to the extent that, Offeror accepts such Common Shares
for payment. Upon such acceptance for payment, all prior powers of attorney,
proxies and consents given by the undersigned with respect to such Common Shares
(and any Distribution) will be revoked without further action, and no subsequent
powers of attorney and proxies may be given nor any subsequent written consents
executed (and, if given or executed, will not be deemed effective). The
designees of Offeror will, with respect to the Common Shares (and any
Distribution) for which such appointment is effective, be empowered to exercise
all voting and other rights of the undersigned as they in their sole discretion
may deem proper at any annual or special meeting of Company stockholders or any
adjournment or postponement thereof, by written consent in lieu of any such
meeting or otherwise. Offeror reserves the right to require that, in order for
the Common Shares to be deemed validly tendered, immediately upon Offeror's
acceptance of such Common Shares, Offeror must be able to exercise full voting
rights with respect to such Common Shares (and any Distribution), including,
without limitation, voting at any meeting of stockholders.

     The undersigned hereby represents and warrants that: (i) the undersigned
has full power and authority to tender, sell, assign and transfer the Common
Shares tendered hereby (and any Distribution) and (ii) when the same are
accepted for payment by the Offeror, the Offeror will acquire good, marketable
and unencumbered title thereto, free and clear of all liens, restrictions,
charges, claims and encumbrances, and the same will not be subject to any
adverse claim and will not have been transferred to the Offeror in violation of
any contractual or other restriction on the transfer thereof. The undersigned,
upon request, shall execute and deliver all additional documents deemed by the
Depositary or the Offeror to be necessary or desirable to complete the sale,
assignment and transfer of the Common Shares tendered hereby (and any
Distribution). In addition, the undersigned shall remit and transfer promptly to
the Depositary for the account of the Offeror any and all Distributions in
respect of the Common Shares tendered hereby, accompanied by appropriate
documentation of transfer, and, pending such remittance and transfer or
appropriate assurance thereof, the Offeror shall be entitled, subject to
applicable law, to all rights and privileges as owner of each such Distribution
and may withhold the

entire Common Share Offer Price or deduct from the Common Share Offer Price the
amount or value of such Distribution as determined by the Offeror in its sole
discretion.

     No authority conferred herein or agreed to be conferred herein shall be
affected by, and all such authority shall survive, the death or incapacity of
the undersigned. All obligations of the undersigned hereunder shall be binding
upon the heirs, executors, administrators, trustees in bankruptcy, personal and
legal representatives, successors and assigns of the undersigned. Tenders of
Common Shares made pursuant to the Offer are irrevocable, except that Common
Shares tendered pursuant to the Offer may be withdrawn at any time prior the
Expiration Date, and, unless theretofore accepted for payment by the Offeror
pursuant to the Offer, may also be withdrawn at any time after March 24, 2001.
See Section 4 -- "Withdrawal Rights" of the Offer to Purchase.

     The undersigned understands that tenders of Common Shares pursuant to any
of the procedures described in Section 3 of the Offer to Purchase and in the
instructions hereto will constitute a binding agreement between the undersigned
and the Offeror upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the
Offer, including the undersigned's representation that the undersigned owns the
Common Shares being tendered. The undersigned recognizes that under certain
circumstances set forth in the Offer to Purchase, the Offeror may not be
required to accept for payment any of the Common Shares tendered hereby. See
Section 14 -- "Certain Conditions to Our Obligations" of the Offer to Purchase.

     Unless otherwise indicated herein in the box entitled "Special Payment
Instructions", please issue the check for the Common Share Offer Price for all
Common Shares purchased and return any certificates for Common Shares not
tendered or not purchased, in the name(s) of the registered holder(s) appearing

check for the Common Share Offer Price for all Common Shares purchased and

Offer Price for all Common Shares purchased and return any certificates for

indicated in the box entitled "Special Payment Instructions", in the case of a
book-entry delivery of Common Shares, please credit the account maintained at
the Book-Entry Transfer Facility with any Common Shares not purchased. The
undersigned recognizes that the Offeror has no obligation, pursuant to the
"Special Payment Instructions", to transfer any Common Shares from the name(s)
of the registered holder(s) thereof if the Offeror does not accept for payment
any of the Common Shares tendered hereby.

             FORMING PART OF THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF THE OFFER

     1. Signature Guarantee.  No signature guarantee on this Letter of
Transmittal is required if (i) this Letter of Transmittal is signed by the
registered holder(s) (which term, for purposes of this document, shall include
any participant in the Book-Entry Transfer Facility whose name appears on a
security position listing as the owner of Common Shares) tendered herewith,
unless such holder(s) have completed either the box entitled "Special Delivery
Instructions" or "Special Payment Instructions" on this Letter of Transmittal or
(ii) such Common Shares are tendered for the account of a financial institution
(including most commercial banks, savings and loan associations and brokerage
houses) that is a member in good standing of the Securities Transfer Agents
Medallion Program, the New York Stock Exchange Medallion Signature Guarantee
Program or the Stock Exchange Medallion Program (each, an "Eligible
Institution"). In all other cases, all signatures on this Letter of Transmittal
must be guaranteed by an Eligible Institution.

     2. Delivery of Letter of Transmittal and Certificates or Book-Entry
Confirmations.  This Letter of Transmittal is to be completed by stockholders
either if Common Share certificates are to be forwarded herewith, or unless an
Agent's Message (as defined in Section 2 -- "Acceptance for Payment and Payment
for Shares" of the Offer to Purchase) is utilized, if tenders are to be made
pursuant to the procedures for delivery by book-entry transfer set forth in
Section 3 -- "Procedure for Tendering Shares" of the Offer to Purchase.
Certificates for all physically tendered Common Shares, or timely confirmation
of a book-entry transfer (a "Book Entry Confirmation") into the Depositary's
account at the Book-Entry Transfer Facility of all Common Shares delivered by
book-entry transfer, together with this Letter of Transmittal (or manually
signed facsimile hereof) properly completed and duly executed with all required
signature guarantees (or, in connection with a book-entry transfer, an Agent's
Message), and any other documents required by this Letter of Transmittal, must
be received by the Depositary at one of its addresses set forth herein on or
prior to the Expiration Date (as defined in Section 1 -- "Terms of the Offer;
Expiration Date; Extension of Tender Period; Termination; Amendment" of the
Offer to Purchase), or the tendering stockholder must comply with the guaranteed
delivery procedures set forth below. If certificates are forwarded to the
Depositary in multiple deliveries, this Letter of Transmittal (or manually
signed facsimile hereof) properly completed and duly executed with all required
signature guarantees must accompany each such delivery.

     Stockholders whose certificates for Common Shares are not immediately
available, who cannot deliver their certificates and all other required
documents to the Depositary on or prior to the Expiration Date, or who cannot
complete the procedures for delivery by book-entry transfer on a timely basis,
may tender their Common Shares pursuant to the guaranteed delivery procedures
set forth in Section 3 -- "Procedure for Tendering Shares" of the Offer to
Purchase. Pursuant to such procedures, (i) such tender must be made by or
through an Eligible Institution, (ii) a properly completed and duly executed
Notice of Guaranteed Delivery, substantially in the form provided by the
Offeror, must be received by the Depositary, either by hand delivery, mail or
facsimile transmission, on or prior to the Expiration Date and (iii) the
certificates for all physically tendered shares, in proper form for transfer (or
a Book-Entry Confirmation) together with this Letter of Transmittal (or manually
signed facsimile thereof) properly completed and duly executed with all required
signature guarantees (or, in the case of a book-entry transfer, an Agent's
Message) and any other documents required by this Letter of Transmittal, must be
received by the Depositary within three trading days after the date of the
execution of the Notice of Guaranteed Delivery. A trading day is any day on
which the Nasdaq Small Cap Market is open for business.

     The method of delivery of this Letter of Transmittal, the certificates for
Common Shares and all other required documents, including delivery through the
Book-Entry Transfer Facility, is at the option and risk of the tendering
stockholder. If delivery is by mail, registered mail with return receipt
requested, properly insured, is recommended. In all cases, sufficient time
should be allowed for such documents to reach the Depositary. Except as
otherwise provided in this Instruction 2, delivery will be deemed made only when
actually received by the Depositary (including, in the case of book-entry
transfer, by Book-Entry Confirmation).

     No alternative, conditional or contingent tenders will be accepted and no
fractional Common Shares will be purchased. All tendering stockholders, by
execution of this Letter of Transmittal (or a facsimile hereof), waive any right
to receive any notice of the acceptance of their Common Shares for payment.

     3. Inadequate Space.  If the space provided herein under "Description of
Common Shares Tendered" is inadequate, the certificate numbers, the number of
Common Shares evidenced by such certificates and the number of Common Shares
tendered should be listed on a separate signed schedule and attached hereto.

     4. Partial Tenders (not applicable to stockholders who tender by book-entry
transfer).  If fewer than all the Common Shares evidenced by any certificate
delivered to the Depositary herewith are to be tendered, fill in the number of
Common Shares that are to be tendered in the box entitled "Number of Shares
Tendered". In such case, as soon as practicable after the Expiration Date, new
certificate(s) evidencing the remainder of the Common Shares that were evidenced
by the certificates delivered to the Depositary herewith will be sent to the
person(s) signing this Letter of Transmittal, unless otherwise provided in the
box entitled "Special Delivery Instructions". All Common Shares represented by
certificates delivered to the Depositary will be deemed to have been tendered
unless otherwise indicated.

     5. Signatures on Letter of Transmittal, Stock Powers and Endorsements.  If
this Letter of Transmittal is signed by the registered holder(s) of the Common
Shares tendered hereby, the signature(s) must correspond with the name(s) as
written on the certificates without alteration, enlargement or any other change
whatsoever.

     If any Common Shares tendered hereby are held of record by two or more
holders, all such holders must sign this Letter of Transmittal.

     If any of the Common Shares tendered hereby are registered in names of
different holders on several certificates, it will be necessary to complete,
sign and submit as many separate Letters of Transmittal as there are different
registrations of certificates.

     If this Letter of Transmittal is signed by the registered holder(s) of the
Common Shares tendered hereby, no endorsements of certificates or separate stock
powers are required unless payment is to be made, or certificates for Common
Shares not tendered or not purchased are to be issued in the name of, a person
other than the registered holder(s), in which case the certificate(s) tendered
hereby must be endorsed or accompanied by appropriate stock powers, in either
case signed exactly as the name(s) of the registered holder(s) appear(s) on such
certificate(s), and the signatures on such certificates or stock powers must be
guaranteed by an Eligible Institution.

     If this Letter of Transmittal is signed by a person other than the
registered owner(s) of the Common Shares tendered hereby, the certificates
tendered hereby must be endorsed or accompanied by appropriate stock powers, in
either case signed as the name(s) of the registered holder(s) appear(s) on such
certificates. Signatures on such certificates and stock powers must be
guaranteed by an Eligible Institution.

     If this Letter of Transmittal or any certificate or stock power is signed
by a trustee, executor, administrator, guardian, attorney-in-fact, agent,
officer of a corporation or other person acting in a fiduciary or representative
capacity, such person should so indicate when signing, and proper evidence
satisfactory to the Offeror of such person's authority to so act must be
submitted.

     6. Special Payment and Delivery Instructions.  If a check for the Common
Share Offer Price of any Common Shares tendered hereby is to be issued, or
certificate(s) not tendered or not purchased are to be issued, in the name of a
person other than the person signing this Letter of Transmittal, or if the check
or any certificate for Common Shares not tendered or not purchased are to be
mailed to someone other than the person(s) signing this Letter of Transmittal,
or to the person(s) signing this Letter of Transmittal but at an address other
than that shown above, the appropriate boxes on this Letter of Transmittal must
be completed. A stockholder tendering by book-entry transfer may request that
Common Shares not accepted for payment be credited to such account maintained at
the Book-Entry Transfer Facility as such stockholder may designate under
"Special Payment Instructions." If no such instructions are given, such Common
Shares not accepted for payment will be returned by crediting the account at the
Book-Entry Transfer Facility designated above.

     7. Stock Transfer Taxes.  Except as set forth in this Instruction 7, the
Offeror will pay or cause to be paid any stock transfer taxes with respect to
the transfer and sale of the purchased Common Shares to it, or to its order,
pursuant to the Offer. If, however, payment of the Common Share Offer Price of
any Common Shares purchased is to be made to, or certificate(s) for Common
Shares not tendered or not purchased are to be issued in the name of, a person
other than the registered holder(s), or if tendered certificates are registered
in the name of any person(s) other than the person(s) signing this Letter of
Transmittal, the amount of any stock transfer taxes (whether imposed on the
registered holder(s), such other person or otherwise) payable on account of the
transfer to such other person will be deducted from the Common Share Offer Price
of such Common Shares purchased, unless evidence satisfactory to the Offeror of
the payment of such taxes or exemption therefrom is submitted. Except as
otherwise provided in this Instruction 7, it will not be necessary for transfer
tax stamps to be affixed to the certificate(s) listed in this Letter of
Transmittal.

     8. Waiver of Conditions.  Subject to the terms of the Merger Agreement (as
defined in the Offer to Purchase), the conditions of the Offer may be waived by
the Offeror, in whole or in part, at any time and from time to time in the
Offeror's sole discretion.

     9. Substitute Form W-9.  Each tendering stockholder is required to provide
the Depositary with a correct taxpayer identification number ("TIN"), generally
the stockholder's social security or federal employer identification number, and
with certain other information, on the Substitute Form W-9, which is provided
under "Important Tax Information" below, and to certify, under penalties of
perjury, that such number is correct and that the stockholder is not subject to
backup withholding of federal income tax. If a tendering stockholder has been
notified by the Internal Revenue Service that such stockholder is subject to
backup withholding, such stockholder must cross out item (2) of the
Certification box (Part 2) of the Substitute Form W-9, unless such stockholder
has since been notified by the Internal Revenue Service that such stockholder is
no longer subject to backup withholding. Failure to provide the information on
the Substitute Form W-9 may subject the tendering stockholder to 31% federal
income tax withholding on the payment of the Common Share Offer Price of all
Common Shares purchased from such stockholder. The box in Part 3 of the
Substitute Form W-9 may be checked if the tendering stockholder has not been
issued a TIN and has applied for a TIN or intends to apply for a TIN in the near
future. If the box in Part 3 is checked and the Depositary is not provided with
the TIN within 60 days, the Depositary will withhold 31% on all payments of the
Common Share Offer Price to such stockholder until a TIN is provided to the
Depositary.

     10. Lost, Mutilated, Destroyed or Stolen Certificates.  If any
certificate(s) representing shares has been lost, mutilated, destroyed or
stolen, the stockholder should complete this Letter of Transmittal and check the
appropriate box above and promptly notify the Transfer Agent. The stockholder
will then be instructed as to the steps that must be taken in order to replace
the certificate(s). This Letter of Transmittal and related documents cannot be
processed until the procedures for replacing lost, mutilated, destroyed or
stolen certificates have been followed. To expedite replacement, call the
Transfer Agent at (800) 635-9270. The stockholder may also be required to give
the Company a bond as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it
with respect to the certificate(s) alleged to have been lost, mutilated,
destroyed or stolen. There can be no assurance that such lost, mutilated,
destroyed or stolen certificate(s) will be replaced prior to the Expiration
Date.

     11. Requests for Assistance or Additional Copies.  Questions or requests
for assistance may be directed to the Information Agent at the address and
telephone number set forth below. Additional copies of the Offer to Purchase,
this Letter of Transmittal, the Notice of Guaranteed Delivery and the Guidelines
for Certification of Taxpayer Identification Number on Substitute Form W-9 may
be obtained from the Information Agent at the address and telephone number set
forth below. Holders of Common Shares may also contact their brokers, dealers,
commercial banks or trust companies or other nominees for assistance concerning
the Offer.

     IMPORTANT:  THIS LETTER OF TRANSMITTAL (OR MANUALLY SIGNED FACSIMILE
HEREOF) PROPERLY COMPLETED AND DULY EXECUTED (WITH ALL REQUIRED GUARANTEES AND
CERTIFICATES OR CONFIRMATION OF BOOK-ENTRY TRANSFER AND ALL OTHER REQUIRED
DOCUMENTS) OR THE NOTICE OF GUARANTEED DELIVERY PROPERLY COMPLETED AND DULY
EXECUTED MUST BE RECEIVED BY THE DEPOSITARY ON OR PRIOR TO THE EXPIRATION DATE.

                           IMPORTANT TAX INFORMATION

     Under federal income tax law, a stockholder whose tendered Common Shares
are accepted for payment is required to provide the Depositary (as payer) with
such stockholder's current TIN on Substitute Form W-9. If such stockholder is an
individual, the TIN is such stockholder's social security number. If the
Depositary is not provided with the correct TIN, the stockholder or other payee
may be subject to a $50 penalty imposed by the Internal Revenue Service. In
addition, payments that are made to such stockholder or other payee with respect
to Common Shares purchased pursuant to the Offer may be subject to backup
withholding of 31%.

     The box in part 3 of the Substitute Form W-9 may be checked if the
tendering stockholder (or other payee) is required to submit a Substitute Form
W-9 and has not been issued a TIN and has applied for a TIN or intends to apply
for a TIN in the near future. If the box in Part 3 is checked, the tendering
stockholder must also complete the attached Certificate of Awaiting Taxpayer
Identification Number in order to avoid backup withholding. If the box in Part 3
is so checked and the Depositary is not provided with a TIN by the time of
payment, the Depositary will withhold 31% on all such payments of the Common
Share Offer Price until a TIN is provided to the Depositary. A tendering
stockholder who checks the box in Part 3 in lieu of furnishing his or her TIN
should furnish the Depositary with his or her TIN as soon as it is received.

     Certain stockholders (including, among others, all corporation, and certain
foreign individuals) are not subject to these backup withholding and reporting
requirements. In order for a foreign individual or a foreign entity to qualify
as an exempt recipient, that stockholder must submit to the Depositary a
properly completed Internal Revenue Service Form W-8 (a "Form W-8"), signed
under penalties of perjury, attesting to that individual's exempt status. A Form
W-8 can be obtained from the Depositary. See the enclosed "Guidelines for
Certification of Taxpayer Identification Number on Substitute Form W-9" for
additional instructions.

     If backup withholding applies, the Depositary is required to withhold 31%
of any payment made to the stockholder or other payee. Backup withholding is not
an additional tax. Rather, the federal income tax liability of persons subject
to backup withholding will be reduced by the amount of tax withheld. If
withholding results in an overpayment of taxes, a refund may be obtained from
the Internal Revenue Service.

PURPOSE OF SUBSTITUTE FORM W-9

     To prevent backup withholding on payments made to a stockholder or other
payee with respect to shares purchased pursuant to the Offer, the stockholder is
required to notify the Depositary of the stockholder's current TIN (or the TIN
of any other payee) by completing the form, certifying that the TIN provided on
Substitute Form W-9 is correct (or that such stockholder is awaiting a TIN), and
that (1) the stockholder has not been notified by the Internal Revenue Service
that the stockholder is subject to backup withholding as a result of failure to
report all interest or dividends or (2) the Internal Revenue Service has
notified the stockholder that the stockholder is no longer subject to backup
withholding.

WHAT NUMBER TO GIVE THE DEPOSITARY

     The stockholder is required to give the Depositary the TIN (i.e., social
security number or employer identification number) of the record owner of the
shares tendered hereby. If the shares are registered in more than one name or
are not registered in the name of the actual owner, consult the enclosed
"Guidelines for Certification of Taxpayer Identification Number on Substitute
Form W-9" for additional guidance on which number to report.

     The undersigned hereby tenders to OEI Acquisition Corp., a Nevada

a Texas corporation (the "Parent"), the above-described shares of Series A
Convertible Preferred stock, par value $.01 per share (the "Preferred Shares"),
of Texoil, Inc., a Nevada corporation (the "Company"), pursuant to the Offeror's
offer to purchase (a) all of the outstanding shares of the Company's Preferred
Stock (the "Preferred Shares"), at a purchase price of $18.04 per Share, net to
the seller in cash, without interest (such price for Preferred Shares referred
to herein as the "Preferred Share Offer Price"), and (b) all of the outstanding
shares of the Company's Common Stock (the "Common Shares"), at a purchase price
of $8.25 per Common Share, net to the seller in cash, without interest, upon the
terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Offer to Purchase, dated
January 24, 2001 (the "Offer to Purchase"), receipt of which is hereby
acknowledged, and this Letter of Transmittal (which, together with the Offer to
Purchase and any amendments or supplements hereto or thereto, collectively
constitute the "Offer").

     Subject to, and effective upon, the acceptance for payment of the Preferred
Shares tendered herewith, in accordance with the terms and subject to the
conditions of the Offer (including, if the Offer is extended or amended, the
terms and conditions of such extension or amendment), the undersigned hereby
sells, assigns and transfers to, or upon the order of, the Offeror, all right,
title and interest in and to all of the Preferred Shares tendered hereby and all
rights associated with such Preferred Shares, including but not limited to all
cash and non-cash dividends, distributions, rights, other Preferred Shares or
other securities issued, paid or distributed or issuable, payable or
distributable in respect thereof (including, without limitation, with respect to
the Preferred Shares, rights to dividends pursuant to Section 4.17 of the
Preferred Stock Purchase Agreement dated October 12, 1997 by and among the
Company and certain stockholders, as amended to the date of the Merger
Agreement) on or after January 18, 2001 (collectively, a "Distribution") and
irrevocably constitutes and appoints the Depositary as the true and lawful agent
and attorney-in-fact of the undersigned with respect to such Preferred Shares
(and any Distribution) with full power of substitution (such power of attorney
being deemed to be an irrevocable power coupled with an interest) to (i) deliver
certificates for such Preferred Shares (and any Distribution) together with all
accompanying evidences of transfer and authenticity, to or upon the order of the
Offeror, upon receipt by the Depositary, as the undersigned's agent, of the
Preferred Share Offer Price, (ii) present such Preferred Shares (and any
Distribution) for transfer on the books of the Company and (iii) receive all
benefits and otherwise exercise all rights of beneficial ownership of such
Preferred Shares (and any Distribution), all in accordance with the terms and
subject to the conditions of the Offer.

     The undersigned irrevocably appoints designees of Offeror as such
undersigned's agents, attorneys-in-fact and proxies, with full power of
substitution, to the full extent of the undersigned's rights with respect to the
Preferred Shares (and any Distribution) tendered by the undersigned and accepted
for payment by Offeror. All such powers of attorney and proxies shall be
considered irrevocable and coupled with an interest. Such appointment will be
effective when, and only to the extent that, Offeror accepts such Preferred
Shares for payment. Upon such acceptance for payment, all prior powers of
attorney, proxies and consents given by the undersigned with respect to such
Preferred Shares (and any Distribution) will be revoked without further action,
and no subsequent powers of attorney and proxies may be given nor any subsequent
written consents executed (and, if given or executed, will not be deemed
effective). The designees of Offeror will, with respect to the Preferred Shares
(and any Distribution) for which such appointment is effective, be empowered to
exercise all voting and other rights of the undersigned as they in their sole
discretion may deem proper at any annual or special meeting of Company
stockholders or any adjournment or postponement thereof, by written consent in
lieu of any such meeting or otherwise. Offeror reserves the right to require
that, in order for the Preferred Shares to be deemed validly tendered,
immediately upon Offeror's acceptance of such Preferred Shares, Offeror must be
able to exercise full voting rights with respect to such Preferred Shares (and
any Distribution), including, without limitation, voting at any meeting of
stockholders.

     The undersigned hereby represents and warrants that: (i) the undersigned
has full power and authority to tender, sell, assign and transfer the Preferred
Shares tendered hereby (and any Distribution) and (ii) when the same are
accepted for payment by the Offeror, the Offeror will acquire good, marketable
and unencumbered title thereto, free and clear of all liens, restrictions,
charges, claims and encumbrances, and the same will not be subject to any
adverse claim and will not have been transferred to the Offeror in violation of
any contractual or other restriction on the transfer hereof. The undersigned,
upon request, shall execute and deliver all additional documents deemed by the
Depositary or the Offeror to be necessary or desirable to complete the sale,
assignment and transfer of the Preferred Shares tendered hereby (and any
Distribution). In addition, the undersigned shall remit and transfer promptly to
the Depositary for the account of the Offeror any and all Distributions in
respect of the Preferred Shares tendered hereby, accompanied by appropriate
documentation of transfer, and, pending such remittance and transfer or
appropriate assurance thereof, the Offeror shall be entitled, subject to
applicable law, to all rights and privileges as owner of each such Distribution
and may withhold the entire Preferred Share Offer Price or deduct from the
Preferred Share Offer Price the amount or value of such Distribution as
determined by the Offeror in its sole discretion.

     No authority conferred herein or agreed to be conferred herein shall be
affected by, and all such authority shall survive, the death or incapacity of
the undersigned. All obligations of the undersigned hereunder shall be binding
upon the heirs, executors, administrators, trustees in bankruptcy, personal and
legal representatives, successors and assigns of the undersigned. Tenders of
Preferred Shares made pursuant to the Offer are irrevocable, except that
Preferred Shares tendered pursuant to the Offer may be withdrawn at any time
prior the Expiration Date, and, unless theretofore accepted for payment by the
Offeror pursuant to the Offer, may also be withdrawn at any time after March 24,
2001. See Section 4 -- "Withdrawal Rights" of the Offer to Purchase.

     The undersigned understands that tenders of Preferred Shares pursuant to
any of the procedures described in Section 3 of the Offer to Purchase and in the
instructions hereto will constitute a binding agreement between the undersigned
and the Offeror upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the
Offer, including the undersigned's representation that the undersigned owns the
Preferred Shares being tendered. The undersigned recognizes that under certain
circumstances set forth in the Offer to Purchase, the Offeror may not be
required to accept for payment any of the Preferred Shares tendered hereby. See
Section 14 -- "Certain Conditions to Our Obligations" of the Offer to Purchase.

trading days after the date of the execution of the Notice of Guaranteed
Delivery. A trading day is any day on which the Nasdaq Small Cap Market is open
for business.

     The method of delivery of this Letter of Transmittal, the certificates for
Preferred Shares and all other required documents is at the option and risk of
the tendering stockholder. If delivery is by mail, registered mail with return
receipt requested, properly insured, is recommended. In all cases, sufficient
time should be allowed for such documents to reach the Depositary. Except as
otherwise provided in this Instruction 2, delivery will be deemed made only when
actually received by the Depositary.

     No alternative, conditional or contingent tenders will be accepted and no
fractional Preferred Shares will be purchased. All tendering stockholders, by
execution of this Letter of Transmittal (or a facsimile hereof), waive any right
to receive any notice of the acceptance of their Preferred Shares for payment.

     3. Inadequate Space.  If the space provided herein under "Description of
Preferred Shares Tendered" is inadequate, the certificate numbers, the number of
Preferred Shares evidenced by such certificates and the number of Preferred
Shares tendered should be listed on a separate signed schedule and attached
hereto.

     4. Partial Tenders.  If fewer than all the Preferred Shares evidenced by
any certificate delivered to the Depositary herewith are to be tendered, fill in
the number of Preferred Shares that are to be tendered in the box entitled
"Number of Preferred Shares Tendered." In such case, as soon as practicable
after the Expiration Date, new certificate(s) evidencing the remainder of the
Preferred Shares that were evidenced by the certificates delivered to the
Depositary herewith will be sent to the person(s) signing this Letter of
Transmittal, unless otherwise provided in the box entitled "Special Delivery
Instructions." All Preferred

Shares represented by certificates delivered to the Depositary will be deemed to
have been tendered unless otherwise indicated.

     5. Signatures on Letter of Transmittal, Stock Powers and Endorsements.  If
this Letter of Transmittal is signed by the registered holder(s) of the
Preferred Shares tendered hereby, the signature(s) must correspond with the
name(s) as written on the certificates without alteration, enlargement or any
other change whatsoever.

     If any Preferred Shares tendered hereby are held of record by two or more
holders, all such holders must sign this Letter of Transmittal.

     If any of the Preferred Shares tendered hereby are registered in names of
different holders on several certificates, it will be necessary to complete,
sign and submit as many separate Letters of Transmittal as there are different
registrations of certificates.

     If this Letter of Transmittal is signed by the registered holder(s) of the
Preferred Shares tendered hereby, no endorsements of certificates or separate
stock powers are required unless payment is to be made, or certificates for
Preferred Shares not tendered or not purchased are to be issued in the name of,
a person other than the registered holder(s), in which case the certificate(s)
tendered hereby must be endorsed or accompanied by appropriate stock powers, in
either case signed exactly as the name(s) of the registered holder(s) appear(s)
on such certificate(s), and the signatures on such certificates or stock powers
must be guaranteed by an Eligible Institution.

     If this Letter of Transmittal is signed by a person other than the
registered owner(s) of the Preferred Shares tendered hereby, the certificates
tendered hereby must be endorsed or accompanied by appropriate stock powers, in
either case signed as the name(s) of the registered holder(s) appear(s) on such
certificates. Signatures on such certificates and stock powers must be
guaranteed by an Eligible Institution.

     If this Letter of Transmittal or any certificate or stock power is signed
by a trustee, executor, administrator, guardian, attorney-in-fact, agent,
officer of a corporation or other person acting in a fiduciary or representative
capacity, such person should so indicate when signing, and proper evidence
satisfactory to the Offeror of such person's authority to so act must be
submitted.

     6. Special Payment and Delivery Instructions.  If a check for the Preferred
Share Offer Price of any Preferred Shares tendered hereby is to be issued, or
certificate(s) not tendered or not purchased are to be issued, in the name of a
person other than the person signing this Letter of Transmittal, or if the check
or any certificate for Preferred Shares not tendered or not purchased are to be
mailed to someone other than the person(s) signing this Letter of Transmittal,
or to the person(s) signing this Letter of Transmittal but at an address other
than that shown above, the appropriate boxes on this Letter of Transmittal must
be completed.

     7. Stock Transfer Taxes.  Except as set forth in this Instruction 7, the
Offeror will pay or cause to be paid any stock transfer taxes with respect to
the transfer and sale of the purchased Preferred Shares to it, or to its order,
pursuant to the Offer. If, however, payment of the Preferred Share Offer Price
of any Preferred Shares purchased is to be made to, or certificate(s) for
Preferred Shares not tendered or not purchased are to be issued in the name of,
a person other than the registered holder(s), or if tendered certificates are
registered in the name of any person(s) other than the person(s) signing this
Letter of Transmittal, the amount of any stock transfer taxes (whether imposed
on the registered holder(s), such other person or otherwise) payable on account
of the transfer to such other person will be deducted from the Preferred Share
Offer Price of such Preferred Shares purchased, unless evidence satisfactory to
the Offeror of the payment of such taxes or exemption therefrom is submitted.
Except as otherwise provided in this Instruction 7, it will not be necessary for
transfer tax stamps to be affixed to the certificates listed in this Letter of
Transmittal.

     8. Waiver of Conditions.  Subject to the terms of the Merger Agreement (as
defined in the Offer to Purchase), the conditions of the Offer may be waived by
the Offeror, in whole or in part, at any time and from time to time in the
Offeror's sole discretion.

     9. Substitute Form W-9.  Each tendering stockholder is required to provide
the Depositary with a correct taxpayer identification number ("TIN"), generally
the stockholder's social security or federal

employer identification number, and with certain other information, on the
Substitute Form W-9, which is provided under "Important Tax Information" below,
and to certify, under penalties of perjury, that such number is correct and that
the stockholder is not subject to backup withholding of federal income tax. If a
tendering stockholder has been notified by the Internal Revenue Service that
such stockholder is subject to backup withholding, such stockholder must cross
out item (2) of the Certification box (Part 2) of the Substitute Form W-9,
unless such stockholder has since been notified by the Internal Revenue Service
that such stockholder is no longer subject to backup withholding. Failure to
provide the information on the Substitute Form W-9 may subject the tendering
stockholder to 31% federal income tax withholding on the payment of the
Preferred Share Offer Price of all Preferred Shares purchased from such
stockholder. The box in Part 3 of the Substitute Form W-9 may be checked if the
tendering stockholder has not been issued a TIN and has applied for a TIN or
intends to apply for a TIN in the near future. If the box in Part 3 is checked
and the Depositary is not provided with the TIN within 60 days, the Depositary
will withhold 31% on all payments of the Preferred Share Offer Price to such
stockholder until a TIN is provided to the Depositary.

     10. Lost, Mutilated, Destroyed or Stolen Certificates.  If any
certificate(s) representing shares has been lost, mutilated, destroyed or
stolen, the stockholder should complete this Letter of Transmittal and check the
appropriate box above and promptly notify the Transfer Agent. The stockholder
will then be instructed as to the steps that must be taken in order to replace
the certificate(s). This Letter of Transmittal and related documents cannot be
processed until the procedures for replacing lost, mutilated, destroyed or
stolen certificates have been followed. To expedite replacement, call the
Transfer Agent at (800) 635-9270. The stockholder may also be required to give
the Company a bond as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it
with respect to the certificate(s) alleged to have been lost, mutilated,
destroyed or stolen. There can be no assurance that such lost, mutilated,
destroyed or stolen certificate(s) will be replaced prior to the Expiration
Date.

     11. Requests for Assistance or Additional Copies.  Questions or requests
for assistance may be directed to the Information Agent at the address and
telephone number set forth below. Additional copies of the Offer to Purchase,
this Letter of Transmittal, the Notice of Guaranteed Delivery and the Guidelines
for Certification of Taxpayer Identification Number on Substitute Form W-9 may
be obtained from the Information Agent at the address and telephone number set
forth below. Holders of Preferred Shares may also contact their brokers,
dealers, commercial banks or trust companies or other nominees for assistance
concerning the Offer.

     IMPORTANT: THIS LETTER OF TRANSMITTAL (OR MANUALLY SIGNED FACSIMILE HEREOF)
PROPERLY COMPLETED AND DULY EXECUTED (WITH ALL REQUIRED GUARANTEES AND
CERTIFICATES AND ALL OTHER REQUIRED DOCUMENTS) OR THE NOTICE OF GUARANTEED
DELIVERY PROPERLY COMPLETED AND DULY EXECUTED MUST BE RECEIVED BY THE DEPOSITARY
ON OR PRIOR TO THE EXPIRATION DATE.

                           IMPORTANT TAX INFORMATION

     Under federal income tax law, a stockholder whose tendered Preferred Shares
are accepted for payment is required to provide the Depositary (as payer) with
such stockholder's current TIN on Substitute Form W-9. If such stockholder is an
individual, the TIN is such stockholder's social security number. If the
Depositary is not provided with the correct TIN, the stockholder or other payee
may be subject to a $50 penalty imposed by the Internal Revenue Service. In
addition, payments that are made to such stockholder or other payee with respect
to Preferred Shares purchased pursuant to the Offer may be subject to backup
withholding of 31%.

     The box in part 3 of the Substitute Form W-9 may be checked if the
tendering stockholder (or other payee) is required to submit a Substitute Form
W-9 and has not been issued a TIN and has applied for a TIN or intends to apply
for a TIN in the near future. If the box in Part 3 is checked, the tendering
stockholder must also complete the attached Certificate of Awaiting Taxpayer
Identification Number in order to avoid backup withholding. If the box in Part 3
is so checked and the Depositary is not provided with a TIN by the time of
payment, the Depositary will withhold 31% on all such payments of the Preferred
Share Offer Price until a TIN is provided to the Depositary. A tendering
stockholder who checks the box in Part 3 in lieu of furnishing his or her TIN
should furnish the Depositary with his or her TIN as soon as it is received.

     Certain stockholders (including, among others, all corporation, and certain
foreign individuals) are not subject to these backup withholding and reporting
requirements. In order for a foreign individual or a foreign entity to qualify
as an exempt recipient, that stockholder must submit to the Depositary a
properly completed Internal Revenue Service Form W-8 (a "Form W-8"), signed
under penalties of perjury, attesting to that individual's exempt status. A Form
W-8 can be obtained from the Depositary. See the enclosed "Guidelines for
Certification of Taxpayer Identification Number on Substitute Form W-9" for
additional instructions.

     If backup withholding applies, the Depositary is required to withhold 31%
of any payment made to the stockholder or other payee. Backup withholding is not
an additional tax. Rather, the federal income tax liability of persons subject
to backup withholding will be reduced by the amount of tax withheld. If
withholding results in an overpayment of taxes, a refund may be obtained from
the Internal Revenue Service.

PURPOSE OF SUBSTITUTE FORM W-9

     To prevent backup withholding on payments made to a stockholder or other
payee with respect to shares purchased pursuant to the Offer, the stockholder is
required to notify the Depositary of the stockholder's current TIN (or the TIN
of any other payee) by completing the form, certifying that the TIN provided on
Substitute Form W-9 is correct (or that such stockholder is awaiting a TIN), and
that (1) the stockholder has not been notified by the Internal Revenue Service
that the stockholder is subject to backup withholding as a result of failure to
report all interest or dividends or (2) the Internal Revenue Service has
notified the stockholder that the stockholder is no longer subject to backup
withholding.

WHAT NUMBER TO GIVE THE DEPOSITARY

     The stockholder is required to give the Depositary the TIN (i.e., social
security number or employer identification number) of the record owner of the
shares tendered hereby. If the shares are registered in more than one name or
are not registered in the name of the actual owner, consult the enclosed
"Guidelines for Certification of Taxpayer Identification Number on Substitute
Form W-9" for additional guidance on which number to report.

To Brokers, Dealers, Commercial Banks,
  Trust Companies and Other Nominees:

     We have been appointed by OEI Acquisition Corp., a Nevada corporation (the
"Offeror"), and Ocean Energy, Inc. a Texas corporation and parent of the Offeror
("Parent"), to act as Information Agent in connection with the Offeror's offer
to purchase (i) all the outstanding shares of common stock, par value $.01 per
share (the "Common Shares"), of Texoil, Inc. (the "Company") at a purchase price
of $8.25 per share, net to the seller, in cash, without interest (such price
referred to herein as the "Common Share Offer Price"), and (ii) all the
outstanding shares of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock, par value $.01 per
share (the "Preferred Shares," and, together with the Common Shares, the
"Shares"), of the Company at a purchase price of $18.04 per share, net to the
seller, in cash, without interest (such price referred to herein as the
"Preferred Share Offer Price") upon the terms and subject to the conditions set
forth in the Offer to Purchase, dated January 24, 2001 (the "Offer to
Purchase"), and in the related Letter of Transmittal (which, as each may be
amended and supplemented from time to time, together constitute the "Offer")
enclosed herewith.

     THE OFFER IS BEING MADE PURSUANT TO AN AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER, DATED
AS OF JANUARY 18, 2001 (THE "MERGER AGREEMENT"), BY AND AMONG PARENT, THE
OFFEROR AND THE COMPANY. THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS OF THE COMPANY HAS (I)
DETERMINED THAT EACH OF THE OFFER AND THE MERGER OF THE OFFEROR WITH AND INTO
THE COMPANY ARE FAIR TO, AND IN THE BEST INTERESTS OF, THE HOLDERS OF SHARES,
(II) APPROVED THE MERGER AGREEMENT AND THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED THEREBY,
INCLUDING THE OFFER AND THE MERGER, (III) DECLARED THE ADVISABILITY OF THE
MERGER AGREEMENT, AND (IV) RECOMMENDED THAT THE COMPANY'S STOCKHOLDERS ACCEPT
THE OFFER,

TENDER THEIR SHARES PURSUANT TO THE OFFER AND (IF REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW)
ADOPT THE MERGER AGREEMENT.

     THE OFFER IS CONDITIONED UPON, AMONG OTHER THINGS, (I) THERE BEING VALIDLY
TENDERED AND NOT WITHDRAWN PRIOR TO THE EXPIRATION OF THE OFFER (A) AT LEAST
THAT NUMBER OF COMMON SHARES OF THE COMPANY WHICH WOULD CONSTITUTE A MAJORITY OF
THE OUTSTANDING COMMON SHARES ON A FULLY DILUTED BASIS (EXCLUDING FOR THIS
PURPOSE COMMON SHARES ISSUABLE UPON CONVERSION OF OUTSTANDING PREFERRED SHARES)
AND (B) AT LEAST THAT NUMBER OF PREFERRED SHARES OF THE COMPANY WHICH WOULD
CONSTITUTE A MAJORITY OF THE PREFERRED SHARES ON A FULLY DILUTED BASIS, ON THE
DATE OF PURCHASE, AND (II) THE SATISFACTION OF CERTAIN OTHER TERMS AND

     Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, following the consummation of the Offer
and the satisfaction or waiver of certain conditions, the Offeror will be merged
with and into the Company (the "Merger"), with the Company continuing as the
surviving corporation (the "Surviving Corporation"). Following consummation of
the Merger, the Surviving Corporation will be a wholly-owned subsidiary of
Parent. At the effective time of the Merger (the "Effective Time"), Shares
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than Shares held by
the Offeror and Shares held by holders who perfect their appraisal rights in
accordance with the Nevada Revised Statutes) will, by virtue of the Merger, be
cancelled and terminated and shall represent solely the right to receive the
Common Share Offer Price or the Preferred Share Offer Price as set forth in the
Merger Agreement and described in the Offer to Purchase.

     Please furnish copies of the enclosed materials to those of your clients
for whose accounts you hold Common Shares registered in your name or in the name

     immediately available or time will not permit all required documents to

     Expiration Date (as defined in the Offer to Purchase) or the procedure for
     book-entry transfer cannot be completed by the Expiration Date.

          5. A printed form of letter which may be sent to your clients for
     whose accounts you hold Common Shares registered in your name or in the

withdrawn as, if and when the Offeror gives oral or written notice to the
Depositary of its acceptance for payment of such Common Shares pursuant to the
Offer. In all cases, payment for Common Shares tendered and accepted for payment
pursuant to the Offer will be made only after timely receipt by the Depositary
of (i) Certificates or a timely confirmation of a book-entry transfer of such
Common Shares into the Depositary's account at the Book-Entry Transfer Facility

expenses of the Depositary and the Information Agent.

PROMPTLY AS POSSIBLE. THE OFFER AND WITHDRAWAL RIGHTS WILL EXPIRE AT 12:00
MIDNIGHT, NEW YORK CITY TIME, ON FEBRUARY 22, 2001 UNLESS THE OFFER IS EXTENDED.

     In order to take advantage of the Offer, a duly executed and properly
completed Letter of Transmittal, with any required signature guarantees and any
other required documents, should be sent to the Depositary, and Certificates
should be delivered or such Common Shares should be tendered by book-entry
transfer, all in accordance with the Instructions set forth in the Letter of
Transmittal and the Offer to Purchase.

     If holders of Common Shares wish to tender shares, but it is impracticable
for them to forward their Certificates or other required documents to the
Depositary prior to the Expiration Date or to comply with the procedures for
book-entry transfer on a timely basis, a tender may be effected by following the
guaranteed delivery procedures specified under Section 3 -- "Procedures for
Tendering Shares" of the Offer to Purchase.

     Any inquiries you may have with respect to the Offer should be addressed
to, and additional copies of the enclosed materials may be obtained from the

     after the purchase of a majority of the Common Shares and a majority of the
     Preferred Shares pursuant to the Offer, subject to the satisfaction or
     waiver of certain conditions contained in the Merger Agreement, Offeror

          6. The Offer is conditioned upon, among other things, the Offeror

     outstanding Preferred Shares determined on a fully diluted basis (the
     "Minimum Condition"). The Offer is also conditioned upon the satisfaction

deemed to be made on behalf of the Offeror by one or more registered brokers or
dealers that are licensed under the laws of such jurisdiction.

     If you wish to have us tender any or all of your Common Shares, please so
instruct us by completing, executing and returning to us the instruction form

Shares will be tendered unless otherwise specified on the instruction form
contained in this letter. YOUR INSTRUCTIONS SHOULD BE FORWARDED TO US IN AMPLE
TIME TO PERMIT US TO SUBMIT A TENDER ON YOUR BEHALF PRIOR TO THE EXPIRATION OF

                         OCEAN ENERGY TO ACQUIRE TEXOIL

     HOUSTON, JANUARY 18, 2001 -- Ocean Energy, Inc. (NYSE:  OEI) and Texoil,
Inc. (NASD: TXLI) today announced the signing of a definitive agreement for
Ocean Energy to acquire all the outstanding shares of common stock of Texoil at
a price of $8.25 per share and all outstanding shares of Series A convertible
preferred stock of Texoil at a price of $18.04 per share. The all-cash
transaction is structured as a first step tender offer followed by a cash merger
to acquire all remaining shares of Texoil common stock and Series A convertible
preferred stock for approximately $130 million including assumed bank debt of
approximately $15 million plus certain other liabilities. The acquisition is
expected to be accretive to Ocean's earnings and cash flow.

     The tender offer is subject to a number of conditions, including the valid
tender of at least a majority of the outstanding common stock and a majority of
the outstanding preferred stock. In conjunction with the tender offer, several
principal stockholders of Texoil, who collectively own greater than a majority
of Texoil's common stock and preferred stock, have agreed to tender their shares

feet of gas equivalent per day.

     "This acquisition will expand our core operating area in South Texas and
complement our strong position in Louisiana," said John D. Schiller, Ocean
Energy Executive Vice President -- Operations. "It also will enhance our ability
to grow production through exploitation and exploration, one of our primary
corporate goals in 2001. Ocean will succeed Texoil as operator of approximately
80 percent of the properties."

     "This transaction provides our shareholders with a premium value for their
holdings," said Frank A. Lodzinski, Chairman, President and Chief Executive
Officer for Texoil, Inc. "Since our inception we have focused on increasing
share value and liquidity for our shareholders, by assembling an attractive
producing asset base with exploration and exploitation potential. This action
fulfills that commitment by providing our shareholders an immediate cash return
on their investment."

     Texoil, Inc. is an independent oil and gas company engaged in the
acquisition of oil and gas reserves through a program, which includes purchases
of reserves, reengineering, development and exploration activities in Texas and
Louisiana.

     Ocean Energy, Inc. is an independent energy company engaged in the

                             OEI Acquisition Corp.,

                               Ocean Energy, Inc.

     OEI Acquisition Corp. (the "Offeror"), a Nevada corporation and a wholly-
owned subsidiary of Ocean Energy, Inc., a Texas corporation ("Parent"), is
offering to purchase (i) all the outstanding shares of common stock, par value
$.01 per share (the "Common Shares"), of Texoil, Inc. (the "Company") at a
purchase price of $8.25 per share, net to the seller, in cash, without interest
(such price referred to herein as the "Common Share Offer Price"), and (ii) all
the outstanding shares of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock, par value $.01
per share (the "Preferred Shares," and, together with the Common Shares, the
"Shares"), of the Company at a purchase price of $18.04 per share, net to the
seller, in cash, without interest (such price referred to herein as the
"Preferred Share Offer Price"), on the terms and subject to the conditions set
forth in the Offer to Purchase dated January 24, 2001 (the "Offer to Purchase")
and in the related Letter of Transmittal for the Common Shares and the related
Letter of Transmittal for the Preferred Shares (each individually, a "Letter of
Transmittal," and together, the "Letters of Transmittal," and which, together
with the Offer to Purchase, as each may be amended and supplemented from time to
time, collectively constitute the "Offer").

  THE OFFER AND WITHDRAWAL RIGHTS WILL EXPIRE AT 12:00 MIDNIGHT, NEW YORK CITY
           TIME, ON FEBRUARY 22, 2001, UNLESS THE OFFER IS EXTENDED.

     The Offer is conditioned upon, among other things, there being validly
tendered by the Expiration Date and not withdrawn (a) at least that number of
Common Shares which would constitute a majority of the outstanding Common Shares
on a fully diluted basis (excluding for this purpose Common Shares issuable but
not yet issued as of such date upon conversion of outstanding Preferred Shares)
on the date of purchase, and (b) at least that number of Preferred Shares which
would constitute a majority of the outstanding Preferred Shares on a fully
diluted basis on the date of purchase (clauses (a) and (b) together, the
"Minimum Condition"). The Offer is also subject to other terms and conditions
described in the Offer to Purchase and in the related Letters of Transmittal.

     The Offer is being made pursuant to the Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated
as of January 18, 2001 (the "Merger Agreement"), by and among Ocean Energy,
Inc., a Texas corporation ("Parent"), the Offeror (jointly, the "Ocean
Entities") and the Company. The Merger Agreement provides that, among other
things, as promptly as practicable after consummation of the Offer and the
satisfaction or waiver of the other conditions contained in the Merger
Agreement, the Offeror will be merged with and into the Company (the "Merger"),
with the Company continuing as the surviving corporation. At the effective time
of the Merger (the "Effective Time"), Shares outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time (other than Shares held by the Company, any wholly-owned
subsidiary of the Company or the Ocean Entities or any wholly-owned subsidiary
of Parent and Shares held by holders who have properly exercised their appraisal
rights in accordance with the Nevada Revised Statutes) will, by virtue of the
Merger, be cancelled and terminated, as of the Effective Time, and shall
represent solely the right to receive the Common Share Offer Price (or any
higher price paid for Common Shares pursuant to the Offer), without interest, or
the Preferred Share Offer Price (or any higher price paid for Preferred Shares
pursuant to the Offer), without interest, as set forth in the Merger Agreement
and described in the Offer to Purchase. The Merger Agreement is more fully
described in Section 13 of the Offer to Purchase.

     The Offeror and Parent have entered into a separate Tender and Voting
Agreement and Tender Agreement with certain stockholders of the Company who own
as of January 18, 2001 an aggregate of approximately 54.8% of the outstanding
Common Shares (45.9% of the Common Shares on a fully diluted basis (excluding
for this purpose Common Shares issuable upon conversion of the Preferred
Shares)) and 100% of the outstanding Preferred Shares. Such stockholders have,
subject to the provisions thereof, agreed, among other things, to validly tender
(and not withdraw) all such Shares pursuant to the Offer.

     The Board of Directors of the Company has (i) determined that each of the
Merger Agreement, the Offer and the Merger are fair to and in the best interests
of the Company's stockholders, (ii) approved the Merger Agreement and the
transactions contemplated thereby,

including the Offer and the Merger and (iii) recommended acceptance of the Offer
by the Company's stockholders and (if required by applicable law) approval of
the Merger Agreement.

     For purposes of the Offer, the Offeror will be deemed to have accepted for
payment (and thereby purchased) Shares validly tendered and not properly
withdrawn as, if and when the Offeror gives written notice to EquiServe Trust
Company, N.A. (the "Depositary") of its acceptance for payment of such Shares
pursuant to the Offer. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions of the
Offer, payment for Shares accepted for payment pursuant to the Offer will be
made by deposit of the purchase price therefor with the Depositary, which will
act as agent for tendering stockholders for the purpose of receiving payments
from the Offeror and transmitting such payments to tendering stockholders whose
Shares have been accepted for payment. Under no circumstances will interest be
paid by the Offeror, regardless of any extension of the Offer or any delay in
making such payment. In all cases, payment for Shares tendered and accepted for
payment pursuant to the Offer will be made only after timely receipt by the
Depositary of (1) certificates evidencing such Shares, or in the case of Common
Shares, timely confirmation of a book-entry transfer of such Common Shares into
the Depositary's account at the Book-Entry Transfer Facility (as defined in the
Offer to Purchase) pursuant to the procedures set forth in Section 3 of the
Offer to Purchase, (2) the related Letter of Transmittal (or a manually signed
facsimile thereof), properly completed and duly executed, with any required
signature guarantees or, in the case of a book-entry transfer of Common Shares,
an Agent's Message (as defined in the Offer to Purchase) and (3) any other
documents required by the Letter of Transmittal.

     The purpose of the Offer is to acquire for cash as many outstanding Shares
as possible as a first step in acquiring the entire common and preferred equity
interest in the Company. The Offer is subject to certain conditions set forth in
the Offer to Purchase. If any such condition is not satisfied, the Offeror may,
except as provided in the Merger Agreement, (i) terminate the Offer and return
all tendered Shares to tendering stockholders, (ii) extend the Offer and,
subject to withdrawal rights as set forth below, retain all such Shares until
the expiration of the Offer as so extended, (iii) waive such condition and
purchase all Shares validly tendered and not withdrawn prior to the expiration
of the Offer, or (iv) delay acceptance for payment or payment for Shares,
subject to applicable laws, until satisfaction or waiver of the conditions to
the Offer.

     The term "Expiration Date" means 12:00 midnight, New York City time, on
February 22, 2001, unless and until the Offeror, in its sole discretion (but
subject to the terms of the Merger Agreement), shall have extended the period of
time during which the Offer is open, in which event the term "Expiration Date"
shall mean the latest time and date on which the Offer, as so extended by the
Offeror, shall expire. Subject to the applicable rules and regulations of the
Securities and Exchange Commission, applicable law and the terms of the Merger
Agreement, the Offeror expressly reserves the right, in its sole discretion, at
any time, from time to time, to extend the period of time during which the Offer
is open by giving oral or written notice of such extension to the Depositary.
Any such extension will be followed as promptly as possible by a public
announcement thereof not later than 9:00 a.m., New York City time, on the next
business day after the day on which the Offer is scheduled to expire. During any
such extension, all Shares previously tendered and not withdrawn will remain
subject to the Offer, subject to the right of a tendering stockholder to
withdraw its Shares.

     Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, the Offeror shall extend the Offer from
time to time until May 31, 2001 if at the then scheduled Expiration Date all of
the conditions to the Offer have not been satisfied or waived as permitted by
the Merger Agreement; provided, however, that the Offeror is required to so
extend the Offer unless, in Parent's reasonable judgment, (i) each such
condition is reasonably capable of being satisfied; (ii) the Company is in
material compliance with all of its covenants in the Merger Agreement; and (iii)
the failure of such condition to be satisfied shall not result from a breach by
the Company of any of its covenants and agreements contained in the Merger
Agreement. Any extension of the Offer shall not, without the written consent of
the Company, exceed the number of days that the Offeror reasonably believes will
be necessary so that the conditions will be satisfied.

     Tenders of Shares made pursuant to the Offer are irrevocable, except that
Shares tendered pursuant to the Offer may be withdrawn at any time prior to the
Expiration Date, and, unless theretofore accepted for payment by the Offeror
pursuant to the Offer, may also be withdrawn at any time after March 24, 2001.
For a withdrawal to be effective, a written or facsimile transmission notice of
withdrawal must be timely received by the Depositary at one of its addresses set
forth on the back cover of the Offer to Purchase. Any such notice of withdrawal
must specify the name of the person who tendered the Shares to be withdrawn, the
class and number of Shares to be withdrawn and the name of the registered holder
of the Shares, if different from that of the person who tendered such Shares. If
stock certificates representing Shares to be withdrawn have been delivered or
otherwise identified to the Depositary, then, prior to the physical release of
such stock certificates, the serial numbers shown on such stock certificates
must be submitted to the Depositary and the signature(s) on the notice of
withdrawal must be guaranteed by an Eligible Institution (as defined in the
Offer to Purchase), unless such Shares have been tendered for the account of an
Eligible Institution. Common Shares tendered pursuant to the procedure for
book-entry transfer, as set forth in Section 3 of the Offer to Purchase, may be
withdrawn only by means of the withdrawal procedures made available by the
Book-Entry Transfer Facility, must specify the name and number of the account at
the Book-Entry Transfer Facility to be credited with the withdrawn Common Shares
and must otherwise comply with the Book-Entry Transfer Facility's procedures.
All questions as to the form and validity (including time of receipt) of any
notice of withdrawal will be determined by the Offeror, in its sole discretion,
whose determination will be final and binding on all parties. Neither the
Offeror, any of its affiliates or assigns, the Depositary, Georgeson Shareholder
Communications Inc., which is acting as the Information Agent for the Offer, or
any other person will be under any duty to give notification of any defects or
irregularities in any notice of withdrawal or incur any liability for failure to
give such notification. Any Shares properly withdrawn will thereafter be deemed
not to have been validly tendered for purposes of the Offer. However, properly
withdrawn Shares may be retendered at any time prior to the Expiration Date by
following one of the procedures described in Section 3 of the Offer to Purchase.

     Subject to the terms of the Merger Agreement, pursuant to Rule 14d-11 under
the Exchange Act, the Offeror may, subject to certain conditions, provide a
subsequent offering period from three to 20 business days in length following
the Expiration Date. A subsequent offering period would be an additional period
of time, following the expiration of the Offer and the purchase of Shares in the
Offer, during which stockholders may tender Shares not tendered in the Offer.
The Offeror does not presently intend to elect to provide a subsequent offering
period, although it reserves the right to do so. Under the Exchange Act, no
withdrawal rights apply to Shares tendered during a subsequent offering period
and no withdrawal rights apply during the subsequent offering period with
respect to Shares tendered in the Offer and accepted for payment. See Section 1
of the Offer to Purchase.

     The receipt by a stockholder of the Company of cash for Shares pursuant to
the Offer and the Merger will be a taxable transaction for United States federal
income tax purposes. All stockholders are urged to consult their own tax
advisors as to the particular tax consequences to them of the Offer and the
Merger.

     The information required to be disclosed by Rule 14d-6(d)(1) of the General
Rules and Regulations under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, is
contained in the Offer to Purchase and is incorporated herein by reference.

     The Company has provided the Offeror with the Company's stockholder list
and security position listing for the purpose of disseminating the Offer to
holders of Shares. The Offer to Purchase, the related Letter of Transmittal and,
if required, other relevant materials will be mailed to recordholders of Shares
whose names appear on the stockholder list and will be furnished to brokers,
dealers, commercial banks, trust companies and similar persons whose names, or
the names of whose nominees, appear on the stockholder list or, if applicable,
who are listed as participants in a clearing agency's security position listing
for subsequent transmittal to beneficial owners of Shares.

     THE OFFER TO PURCHASE AND THE RELATED LETTERS OF TRANSMITTAL CONTAIN
IMPORTANT INFORMATION WHICH SHOULD BE READ CAREFULLY BEFORE ANY DECISION IS MADE
WITH RESPECT TO THE OFFER.

Questions and requests for assistance may be directed to the Information Agent
at the address and telephone numbers set forth below. Requests for copies of the
Offer to Purchase and the related Letters of Transmittal and all other tender
offer materials may be directed to the Information Agent, and copies will be

or commissions to any broker or dealer or any other person (other than the
Information Agent) for soliciting tenders of Shares pursuant to the Offer.

(a) Provided that this Agreement shall not have been terminated in accordance
with Article VIII hereof and none of the events set forth in Annex I hereto
shall have occurred or be existing (and shall not have been waived by
Purchaser), as promptly as practicable but in no event later than the fifth
Business Day following the public announcement by Parent and the Company of the
execution of this Agreement, Purchaser shall commence (within the meaning of
Rule 14d-2 under the Exchange Act) the Offer to purchase all outstanding Common
Shares at the Offer Price and all outstanding Preferred Shares at the Preferred
Offer Price. Any Shares acquired pursuant to the Offer will include, by way of
amplification and not limitation, all rights associated with such Shares,
including but not limited to all cash and non-cash dividends, distributions,
rights, other Shares or other securities issued, paid or distributed or
issuable, payable or distributable in respect thereof on or after the date of
this Agreement (including,

without limitation, with respect to the Preferred Shares, rights to dividends
pursuant to Section 4.17 of the Preferred Stock Purchase Agreement). As promptly
as practicable on the date of commencement of the Offer, Purchaser shall file
with the SEC a Tender Offer Statement on Schedule TO (together with all
amendments and supplements thereto, the "SCHEDULE TO") with respect to the
Offer. The Schedule TO shall contain or incorporate by reference an offer to
purchase and forms of the related letters of transmittal and other ancillary
offer documents (collectively, together with all supplements and amendments

in all material respects with the Exchange Act. Purchaser shall disseminate to

obligation of Purchaser to accept for payment and pay for any Shares tendered
pursuant thereto will be subject only to the satisfaction of the conditions set
forth in Annex I hereto (the "TENDER OFFER CONDITIONS"). The Offer Price and the
Preferred Offer Price shall be net to the seller in cash, without interest,
subject to reduction only for any applicable withholding taxes or stock transfer
taxes payable by the seller. The Company agrees that no Shares held by the
Company or any of its subsidiaries will be tendered in the Offer.

         (b) Purchaser specifically reserves the right to waive any condition of
the Offer, to increase the Offer Price and the Preferred Offer Price and to make
any other changes in the terms and conditions of the Offer; provided that
without the prior written consent of the Company, Purchaser shall not decrease
the Offer Price or the Preferred Offer Price or change the form of consideration
payable in the Offer, decrease the number of Shares sought to be purchased in
the Offer, impose additional conditions to the Offer or amend any other term of
the Offer in any manner materially adverse to the holders of Shares or reduce
the time period during which the Offer shall remain open. Subject to the terms
of the Offer and this Agreement and the satisfaction or waiver of all the Tender
Offer Conditions as of any Expiration Date, Purchaser will accept for payment
and pay for all Shares validly tendered and not withdrawn pursuant to the Offer
as soon as practicable after such Expiration Date of the Offer. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, Purchaser shall be entitled to extend the Offer, without the
consent of the Company if at the initial expiration of the Offer, which will be
12:00 midnight eastern standard time on the twentieth Business Day following
commencement of the Offer (such date and time, as extended in accordance with
the term hereof, the "EXPIRATION DATE"), or any extension thereof, any condition
to the Offer is not satisfied or waived, and Purchaser agrees to extend the
Offer from time to time until the Termination Date if at the then scheduled
Expiration Date all of the Tender Offer Conditions have not been satisfied or
waived as permitted by this Agreement; provided, however, that Purchaser shall
not be required to extend the Offer as provided in this sentence unless, in
Parent's reasonable judgment, (i) each such condition is reasonably capable of
being satisfied; (ii) the Company is in material compliance with all of its
covenants in this Agreement; and (iii) the failure of such condition to be
satisfied shall not result from a breach by the Company of any of its covenants
and agreements contained in this Agreement. Any extension of the Offer pursuant
to this Section 2.01 shall not, without the written consent of the Company,
exceed the number of days that Purchaser reasonably believes will be necessary
so that the Tender Offer Conditions will be satisfied. In addition, Purchaser
may, without the consent of the Company, extend any then scheduled Expiration
Date of the Offer for any period required by applicable rules, regulations,
interpretations or positions of the SEC or the staff thereof applicable to the
Offer or for any period required by applicable law. If the Minimum Condition (as
defined in Annex I hereto) has been satisfied and all other conditions to the
Offer have been satisfied or waived but fewer than 90% of the Shares have been
validly tendered and not

withdrawn as of any Expiration Date, Purchaser shall accept and purchase all of
the Shares tendered in the initial offer period and may provide for a subsequent
offering period (as contemplated by Rule 14d-11 under the Exchange Act) as long
as providing for the subsequent offering period does not require the extension
of the initial offer period under applicable rules and regulations of the SEC,
which subsequent offering period shall not exceed 20 Business Days. In addition,
the Offer Price and the Preferred Offer Price may be increased and the Offer may
be extended to the extent required by law in connection with such increase in
each case without the consent of the Company. On or prior to the dates that
Purchaser becomes obligated to accept for payment and pay for Shares pursuant to
the Offer, Parent shall provide or cause to be provided to Purchaser the funds
necessary to pay for all Shares that Purchaser becomes so obligated to accept
for payment and pay for pursuant to the Offer.

         (c) Parent and Purchaser represent that the Offer Documents will comply
in all material respects with the provisions of applicable federal securities
laws and, on the date filed with the SEC and on the date first published, sent
or given to the Company's stockholders, will not contain any untrue statement of
a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein
or necessary in order to make the statements made therein, in light of the

representation is made by Parent or Purchaser with respect to information
supplied by the Company for inclusion in the Offer Documents. The Company and
its counsel shall be given a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on the
Offer Documents and any amendments thereto prior to the filing thereof with the
SEC. Each of Parent and Purchaser, on the one hand, and the Company, on the
other hand, agrees promptly to correct any information provided by it for use in
the Offer Documents if and to the extent that it shall have become false or
misleading in any material respect and Purchaser further agrees to take all
steps necessary to cause the Offer Documents as so corrected to be filed with
the SEC and to be disseminated to stockholders of the Company, in each case, as
and to the extent required by applicable federal securities laws. Parent and
Purchaser will provide the Company and its counsel with a copy of any written
comments or telephonic notification of any oral comments Parent or Purchaser
receives from the SEC or its staff with respect to the Offer Documents promptly
after receipt thereof and will provide the Company and its counsel with a copy

         SECTION 2.03. Directors.

         (a) Subject to compliance with applicable law, promptly upon the

number, on the Board of Directors of the Company as is equal to the product of

request of Purchaser, promptly take all actions necessary to cause Purchaser's
designees to be so elected, including, if necessary, seeking the resignations of
one or more existing directors, increasing the number of authorized directors or

Board of Directors of the Company shall have at least two members who are

Independent Directors remain, the other directors shall designate one person to
fill one of the vacancies who shall be neither an employee of the Company nor an
Affiliate of Parent and such person shall be deemed to be an Independent
Director for purposes of this Agreement. Upon written request of Purchaser, the
Company shall cause the designees of Purchaser to constitute the same percentage
of representation as is on the Board of Directors of the Company after giving
effect to this Section 2.03 on (i) each committee of the Board of Directors of
the Company; (ii) the Board of Directors of each Company Subsidiary; and (iii)
each committee of each such board. The provisions of this Section 2.03 shall not
limit any rights that Purchaser, Parent or any of their Affiliates may have as a
holder or beneficial owner of Shares as a matter of law with respect to the

actions required pursuant to such Section and Rule in order to fulfill its
obligations under this Section 2.03 and shall include in the Schedule 14D-9

Purchaser has not theretofore designated directors or timely provided the
requisite information) such information with respect to the Company and its
officers and directors as is required under such Section and Rule in order to
fulfill its obligations under this Section 2.03. Parent and Purchaser will
supply any information with respect to itself and its officers, directors and
Affiliates required by such Section and Rule to the Company.

         (c) Following the election or appointment of Parent's designees
pursuant to this Section 2.03 and prior to the Effective Time, any amendment or
termination of this Agreement by the Company, any extension of time for
performance of any of the obligations of Parent or Purchaser hereunder, any
waiver of any condition or any of the Company's rights hereunder or

other action by the Company hereunder adversely affecting the rights of the
stockholders of the Company other than Purchaser and its Affiliates, will
require the concurrence of the Independent Directors.

                                  ARTICLE III.

between Parent and the Company) being the "EFFECTIVE TIME").

         SECTION 3.03. Effect of the Merger. At the Effective Time, the effect
of the Merger shall be as provided in the applicable provisions of the NRS
(except as provided herein). Without limiting the generality of the foregoing,
and subject thereto, at the Effective Time, all the property, rights,

disabilities and duties of each of the Company and Purchaser shall become the
debts, liabilities, obligations, restrictions, disabilities and duties of the
Surviving Corporation.

         SECTION 3.04. Articles of Incorporation; Bylaws. At the Effective Time,
the Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation shall be

Inc."), in each case until duly amended in accordance with applicable law.

         SECTION 3.05. Directors and Officers.

         (a) The directors of Purchaser immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall be the directors of the Surviving Corporation at the Effective Time, each
to hold office in accordance with the Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws of

         (b) The officers of Purchaser immediately prior to the Effective Time

virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the holder of any
Shares or any shares of capital stock of Purchaser:

         (a) Capital Stock of Purchaser. Each issued and outstanding share of
capital stock of Purchaser shall be converted into and become one fully paid and
nonassessable share of common stock of the Surviving Corporation.

         (b) Cancellation of Treasury Stock and Parent-Owned Stock. Each Share
that is owned by the Company or by any wholly-owned Subsidiary of the Company
and each Share that is owned by Parent, Purchaser or any other wholly-owned

to exist, and no consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor.

         (c) Conversion of Company Common Stock. Subject to Section 3.06(e),
each issued and outstanding share of Company Common Stock (other than such
shares to be canceled in accordance with Section 3.06(b)) shall be cancelled and
terminated and shall represent solely the right to receive from the Surviving
Corporation in cash, without interest, the Offer Price. As of the Effective
Time, all such Shares shall no longer be outstanding and shall be automatically
canceled and retired and shall cease to exist, and each holder of a certificate
representing any such Shares shall cease to have any rights with respect
thereto, except the right to receive the Offer Price, without interest.

         (d) Conversion of Company Preferred Stock. Subject to Section 3.06(e),
each issued and outstanding share of Company Preferred Stock (other than such
shares to be canceled in accordance with Section 3.06(b)) shall be cancelled and
terminated and shall represent solely the right to receive from the Surviving
Corporation in cash, without interest, an amount equal to the Preferred Offer
Price. As of the Effective Time, all such Shares shall no longer be outstanding
and shall be automatically canceled and retired and shall cease to exist, and
each holder of a certificate representing any such Shares shall cease to have
any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the Preferred Offer
Price, without interest.

         (e) Shares of Dissenting Stockholders.

             (i)  Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the
                  contrary, Shares that are outstanding immediately prior to the
                  Effective Time and which are

                  held by holders of Shares who shall have not voted in favor of
                  the Merger or consented thereto in writing and who shall have
                  demanded properly in writing payment of the fair market value
                  of such Shares in accordance with Section 92A.420 of the NRS
                  (collectively, the "DISSENTING SHARES") shall be cancelled and
                  terminated and shall represent solely the right to receive
                  payment from the Surviving Corporation of the fair market
                  value of such Shares held by them in accordance with the
                  provisions of the NRS, except that all Dissenting Shares held
                  by holders of Shares who shall have failed to perfect or who
                  effectively shall have withdrawn or lost their rights for an
                  appraisal of such shares under the NRS shall thereupon be
                  deemed to have been cancelled and terminated, as of the
                  Effective Time, and shall represent solely the right to
                  receive the Offer Price as provided in Section 3.06(c) or the
                  Preferred Offer Price as provided in 3.06(d), as applicable,
                  upon surrender in the manner provided in Section 3.07, of the
                  certificate or certificates that formerly evidenced such
                  Shares.

         (ii)     The Company shall give to Parent (i) prompt notice of any
                  demands for appraisal received by the Company, withdrawals of
                  such demands, and any other instruments served pursuant to the
                  NRS and received by the Company and (ii) the opportunity to
                  direct all negotiations and proceedings with respect to
                  demands for payment of fair market value under the NRS. The
                  Company shall not, except with the prior written consent of
                  Parent, make any payment with respect to any such demands, or
                  offer to settle, or settle, any such demands. Any amount
                  payable to any holder of Shares exercising dissenters' rights
                  shall be paid solely by the Surviving Corporation out of its
                  own funds.

         SECTION 3.07. Exchange of Company Certificates.

         (a) Paying Agent. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall designate a
bank or trust company to act as agent for the holders of the Shares in
connection with the Merger (the "PAYING AGENT") to receive in trust the funds to
which holders of the Shares shall become entitled pursuant to Sections 3.06(c)
and 3.06(d). From time to time, Parent shall make available, or cause the
Surviving Corporation to make available, to the Paying Agent cash in amounts and
at times necessary for the prompt payment of the Offer Price as provided in
Section 3.06(c) and the Preferred Offer Price as provided in Section 3.06(d)
upon surrender of certificates representing Shares as provided herein. All
interest earned on such funds shall be paid to Parent.

         (b) Exchange Procedure. As soon as reasonably practicable after the
Effective Time, the Paying Agent shall mail to each holder of record of a
certificate or certificates that immediately prior to the Effective Time
represented Shares (the "COMPANY CERTIFICATES"), (i) a letter of transmittal
(which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title
to the Company Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of the Company
Certificates to the Paying Agent and shall be in a form and have such other
provisions as Parent may reasonably specify) and (ii) instructions for use in
effecting the surrender of the Company Certificates in exchange for the Offer
Price as provided in Section 3.06(c) or the Preferred Offer Price as provided in
Section 3.06(d), as the case may be. Upon surrender of a Company Certificate for

cancellation to the Paying Agent or to such other agent or agents as may be
appointed by Parent, together with such letter of transmittal, duly executed,
and such other documents as may reasonably be required by the Paying Agent, the
holder of such Company Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange
therefor the amount of cash into which the Shares theretofore represented by
such Company Certificate shall have been converted pursuant to Sections 3.06(c)
or 3.06(d), as the case may be, and the Company Certificate so surrendered shall
forthwith be canceled. In the event of a transfer of ownership of Shares that is
not registered in the transfer records of the Company, payment may be made to a
Person other than the Person in whose name the Company Certificate so
surrendered is registered, if such Company Certificate shall be properly
endorsed or otherwise be in proper form for transfer and the Person requesting
such payment shall pay any transfer or other taxes required by reason of the
payment to a Person other than the registered holder of such Company Certificate
or establish to the satisfaction of the Surviving Corporation that such tax has
been paid or is not applicable. Until surrendered as contemplated by this
Section 3.07, each Company Certificate shall be deemed at any time after the
Effective Time to represent only the right to receive upon such surrender the
amount of cash, without interest, into which the Shares theretofore represented
by such Company Certificate shall have been converted pursuant to Sections
3.06(c) or 3.06(d), as the case may be. No interest will be paid or will accrue
on the cash payable upon the surrender of any Company Certificate.

         (c) No Further Ownership Rights in Shares; Transfer Books. All cash
paid upon the surrender of Company Certificates in accordance with the terms of
this Article III shall be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all
rights pertaining to the Shares theretofore represented by such Company
Certificates. At the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the Company
shall be closed, and there shall be no further registration of transfers on the
stock transfer books of the Surviving Corporation of the Shares that were
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective
Time, Company Certificates are presented to the Surviving Corporation or the
Paying Agent for any reason, they shall be canceled and exchanged as provided in
this Article III.

         (d) Termination of Fund; No Liability. At any time following six months
after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to require
the Paying Agent to deliver to it any funds (including any interest received
with respect thereto) which had been made available to the Paying Agent and
which have not been disbursed to holders of Company Certificates, and thereafter
such holders shall be entitled to look to the Surviving Corporation (subject to
abandoned property, escheat or other similar laws) only as general creditors
thereof with respect to the Offer Price or the Preferred Offer Price, as
applicable, payable upon due surrender of their Company Certificates, without
any interest thereon. Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of Parent, Purchaser,
the Company or the Paying Agent shall be liable to any Person in respect of any
cash delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned
property, escheat or similar law. If any Company Certificates shall not have
been surrendered immediately prior to such date on which any payment pursuant to
this Article III would otherwise escheat to or become the property of any
Governmental Authority, the cash payment in respect of such Company Certificate
shall, to the extent permitted by applicable law, become the property of the
Surviving Corporation, free and clear of all claims or interests of any Person
previously entitled thereto.

         (e) Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates. In the event any Company
Certificates evidencing Shares shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, the
Paying Agent shall pay to such holder the Offer Price required pursuant to
Section 3.06(c) or the Preferred Offer Price required pursuant to Section
3.06(d), as applicable, in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Company
Certificates, upon the making of an affidavit, which shall include indemnities
which are acceptable to Parent, of that fact by the holder thereof with such
assurances as the Paying Agent, in its discretion and as a condition precedent
to the payment of the Offer Price or the Preferred Offer Price, as applicable,
may reasonably require of the holder of such lost, stolen or destroyed Company
Certificates.

         (f) Withholding Taxes. Parent and Purchaser shall be entitled to deduct
and withhold, or cause the Paying Agent to deduct and withhold, from the
consideration otherwise payable to a holder of Shares pursuant to the Offer or
the Merger any stock transfer taxes and such amounts as are required under the
Code, or any applicable provisions of state, local or foreign tax law. To the
extent that amounts are so withheld, such withheld amounts shall be treated for
all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of the Shares
in respect of which such deduction and withholding were made.

         SECTION 3.08. Stock Options and Warrants.

         (a) Options.

         (i)      Each outstanding and unexercised option to purchase shares of
                  Company Common Stock ("COMPANY OPTION") pursuant to each stock
                  option and incentive plan of or sponsored by the Company (the
                  "COMPANY OPTION PLANS"), that is fully vested and exercisable
                  as of the consummation of the Offer shall be converted into an
                  obligation of the Company to pay, and a right of the holder
                  thereof to receive in full satisfaction of such Option, cash
                  in an amount in respect thereof equal to the product of (A)
                  the excess, if any, of the Offer Price over the exercise price
                  thereof and (B) the number of shares of Company Common Stock
                  subject to such Company Option (such payment to be net of
                  withholding taxes) (the "COMPANY OPTION PAYMENTS"). The
                  Company shall take all actions necessary to cause the
                  Company's employees and directors to consent, to the extent
                  required, to the transactions contemplated by this Section
                  3.08(a) no later than immediately prior to the time Purchaser
                  accepts Shares for payment pursuant to the Offer. Except as
                  may be otherwise agreed to by Parent or Purchaser and the
                  Company, as of the Effective Time, (A) the Company Option
                  Plans shall terminate, (B) the provisions in any other plan,
                  program or arrangement providing for the issuance or grant of
                  any other interest in respect of the capital stock of the
                  Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries shall be deleted
                  and (C) no holder of Company Options or any participant in the
                  Company Option Plans or any other plans, programs or
                  arrangements shall have any rights thereunder to acquire any
                  equity securities of the Company, the Surviving Corporation or
                  any subsidiary thereof. All Company Options outstanding as of
                  the date of this Agreement, the price at which they are
                  exercisable and the vesting schedule therefore are listed on
                  Section 3.08(a) of the Disclosure Letter. The Company and
                  Parent agree that the

                  Company Option Payments are the sole payments that will be
                  made with respect to or in relation to the Company Options.

         (ii)     With respect to each Company Option granted pursuant to the
                  terms of a Company Option Plan that is not vested and
                  exercisable as of the consummation of the Offer, the Company
                  or the Surviving Corporation, as applicable, shall make the
                  payment of the amount determined pursuant to Section
                  3.08(a)(i) above at the time each such unvested Company Option
                  would otherwise have become vested and exercisable subject to
                  the satisfaction of the terms and conditions set forth in the
                  applicable option award agreement and the Company Option Plan
                  pursuant to which such Company Option was granted, or at such
                  earlier date as may be determined by Parent in its sole and
                  absolute discretion.

         (b) Warrants. At the Effective Time, each warrant to purchase shares of
Company Common Stock, that is then outstanding and exercisable (each a "COMPANY
WARRANT"), shall be cancelled and converted into the right to receive cash in an
amount equal to the product of (A) the excess, if any, of the Offer Price over
the exercise price of such Company Warrant and (B) the number of Shares
previously subject to such Company Warrant immediately prior to its cancellation
(such payment to be net of withholding taxes) (the "COMPANY WARRANT PAYMENTS").
The Company shall take all actions necessary to cause the holders of the Company
Warrants to consent, to the extent required, to the transactions contemplated by
this Section 3.08(b) no later than immediately prior to the time Purchaser
accepts Shares for payment pursuant to the Offer. All Company Warrants
outstanding as of the date of this Agreement, the date or dates when they become
exercisable if not exercisable on the date of this Agreement and the price at
which they are exercisable are listed on Section 3.08(b) of the Disclosure
Letter. The Company and Parent agree that the Company Warrant Payments are the
sole payments that will be made with respect to or in relation to the Company
Warrants.

         SECTION 3.09. Subsequent Actions. If, at any time after the Effective
Time, the Surviving Corporation shall consider or be advised that any deeds,
bills of sale, assignments, assurances or any other actions or things are
necessary or desirable to vest, perfect or confirm of record or otherwise in the
Surviving Corporation its right, title or interest in, to or under any of the
rights, properties or assets of either of the Company or Purchaser acquired or
to be acquired by the Surviving Corporation as a result of, or in connection
with, the Merger or otherwise to carry out this Agreement, the officers and
directors of the Surviving Corporation shall be authorized to execute and
deliver, in the name and on behalf of either the Company or Purchaser, all such
deeds, bills of sale, assignments and assurances and to take and do, in the name
and on behalf of each of such corporations or otherwise, all such other actions
and things as may be necessary or desirable to vest, perfect or confirm any and
all right, title and interest in, to and under such rights, properties or assets
in the Surviving Corporation or otherwise to carry out this Agreement.

                           excise tax is due or would be due in the absence of a
                           waiver) as defined in Section 412 of the Code or as

                           Plan with respect to any plan year, whether or not
                           waived. Neither the Company nor any ERISA Affiliate
                           has failed to pay when due any "required
                           installment," within the meaning of Section 412(m) of
                           the Code and Section 302(e) of ERISA, whichever may
                           apply, with respect to any Pension Plan. Neither the
                           Company nor any ERISA Affiliate is subject to any
                           lien imposed under Section 412(n) of the Code or
                           Section 302(f) or 4068 of ERISA,

                           whichever may apply, with respect to any Pension
                           Plan. All "benefit liabilities" within the meaning of
                           Section 4001(a)(16) of ERISA, are fully funded as of
                           the Closing Date with respect to each Pension Plan as
                           determined on a termination basis using the assumed
                           interest rate set forth in each Pension Plan or
                           otherwise required by ERISA or the Code. Neither the
                           Company nor any ERISA Affiliate is required to
                           provide security to a Pension Plan under Section
                           401(a)(29) of the Code.

                  (ii)     No Pension Plan is "top heavy" within the meaning of
                           Section 416 of the Code.

                  (iii)    Each Pension Plan and each related trust agreement,
                           annuity contract or other funding instrument which is
                           intended to be qualified and tax exempt under the
                           provisions of Code Sections 401(a) and 501(a) or 408,
                           as applicable, is so qualified and, except for
                           Pension Plans which are qualified under Code Section
                           408, each such plan has been so determined by the
                           Internal Revenue Service pursuant to a favorable
                           determination letter considering the Tax Reform Act
                           of 1986, as amended, or application for such
                           determination has been made within the applicable
                           remedial amendment period and is currently pending.

                  (iv)     Each Pension Plan, related trust agreement, annuity
                           contract or other funding instrument is in material
                           compliance with its terms and, both as to form and in
                           operation, with the requirements prescribed by any
                           and all Laws which are applicable to such Pension
                           Plan, including without limitation ERISA and the
                           Code.

                  (v)      The Company or an ERISA Affiliate has paid all
                           premiums (and interest charges and penalties for late
                           payment, if applicable) due to the PBGC with respect
                           to each Pension Plan which is covered by Title IV of
                           ERISA for each plan year thereof for which such
                           premiums are required. Neither the Company nor any
                           ERISA Affiliate has engaged in, or is a successor or
                           affiliate of an entity that has engaged in, a
                           transaction which is described in Section 4069 or
                           Section 4212(c) of ERISA. There has been no
                           unreported "reportable event" (as defined in Section
                           4043(b) of ERISA and the PBGC regulations under such
                           Section) requiring notice to the PBGC with respect to
                           any Pension Plan. No filing has been made by the
                           Company or any ERISA Affiliate with the PBGC, and no
                           proceeding has been commenced by the PBGC, to
                           terminate any Pension Plan. No condition exists and
                           no event has occurred that could constitute grounds
                           for the termination of any Pension Plan by the PBGC,
                           or which could reasonably be expected to result in
                           liability of the Company or any ERISA Affiliate to
                           the PBGC with respect to any Pension Plan, other than
                           liabilities for premium payments. Neither the Company
                           nor any ERISA Affiliate has, at any time, (1) ceased
                           operations at a facility so as to become subject to
                           the provisions of Section 4062(e) of ERISA, (2)
                           withdrawn as a substantial employer so as to become
                           subject to the

                           provisions of Section 4063 of ERISA, (3) ceased
                           making contributions on or before the Closing Date to
                           any Pension Plan subject to Section 4064(a) of ERISA
                           to which the Company or any ERISA Affiliate made
                           contributions during the six years prior to the
                           Closing Date, or (4) otherwise incurred any liability
                           to the PBGC, including the creation of a lien against
                           any property of the Company or any ERISA Affiliate
                           pursuant to Section 4068 of ERISA.

         (b) Multiemployer Plans. There are no Multiemployer Plans, and neither
the Company nor any ERISA Affiliate has ever maintained, contributed to, or
participated or agreed to participate in any Multiemployer Plan. Neither the
Company nor any ERISA Affiliate has ever withdrawn, partially or completely, or
instituted steps to withdraw, whether partially or completely, from any
Multiemployer Plan, nor has any event occurred which could enable a
Multiemployer Plan to give notice of and demand payment of any withdrawal
liability with respect to the Company or any ERISA Affiliate.

         (c) Welfare Plans.

                  (i)      Each Welfare Plan is in material compliance with its
                           terms and, both as to form and operation, with the
                           requirements prescribed by any and all Laws which are
                           applicable to such Welfare Plan, including without
                           limitation ERISA and the Code.

                  (ii)     An estimate of the liabilities of the Company and any
                           ERISA Affiliates for providing retiree life and
                           medical benefits coverage to active and retired
                           employees of the Company and any ERISA Affiliates has
                           been made and is reflected on the appropriate balance
                           sheet and books and records according to Statement of
                           Financial Accounting Standards No. 106. The Company
                           or any ERISA Affiliate has the right to modify or
                           terminate each Welfare Plan that provides coverage or
                           benefits for either or both retired and active
                           employees and/or their beneficiaries.

                  (iii)    Each Welfare Plan which is a "group health plan," as
                           defined in Section 607(1) of ERISA, has been operated
                           in material compliance with provisions of Part 6 and
                           7 of Title I, Subtitle B of ERISA and Sections 4980B,
                           9801-9803, 9811, 9812, and 9831-9833 of the Code at
                           all times.

                  (iv)     No Welfare Plans are self-insured "multiple employer
                           welfare arrangements" as such term is defined in
                           Section 3(40) of ERISA.

         (d) Benefit Arrangements. Each Benefit Arrangement is in material
compliance with its terms and with the requirements prescribed by any and all
Laws which are applicable to such Benefit Arrangement, including without
limitation the Code.

         (e) Fiduciary Duties and Prohibited Transactions. Neither the Company
nor any ERISA Affiliate has any liability with respect to any transaction which
relates to any Pension Plan or any Welfare Plan and which is in violation of
Sections 404 or 406 of ERISA or constitutes a "prohibited transaction," as
defined in Section 4975(c)(1) of the Code, and for

which no exemption exists under Section 408 of ERISA or Section 4975(c)(2) or
(d) of the Code. To the Knowledge of the Company, neither it nor any ERISA
Affiliate has participated in a violation of Part 4 of Title I, Subtitle B of

judgment or decree outstanding or claim, suit, litigation, proceeding, arbitral
action, governmental audit or investigation (including, without limitation, any
such audit or investigation by the Internal Revenue Service, Department of
Labor, or PBGC) relating to or seeking benefits under any Employee Plan that is
pending or, to the Knowledge of the Company, threatened or anticipated against
the Company or any ERISA Affiliate other than routine claims for benefits. To
the best of the Company's Knowledge, no Employee has any material claim against
the Company (whether under federal or state law, any employment agreement, or
otherwise) on account of or for (i) overtime pay, other than overtime pay for
the current payroll period; (ii) wages or salary for any period other than the
current payroll period; (iii) vacation, time off, sick time or pay in lieu of
any of the foregoing, other than that earned in respect of the current fiscal

regulation relating to minimum wages or maximum hours of work. To the best of
the Company's Knowledge, no Employee has any material claim, or basis for any
material action or proceeding against the Company, arising under any statute,
ordinance or regulation relating to discrimination in employment or employment
practices, occupational safety and health standards or workers' compensation.

         (g) Unpaid Contributions. Neither the Company nor any ERISA Affiliate
has any liability for unpaid contributions with respect to any Employee Plan.
The Company and all ERISA Affiliates have made all required contributions and
paid all accrued liabilities under each Employee Plan for all periods through

liability shall include a pro rata contribution to each Employee Plan for that
portion of a plan year or other applicable period which precedes the Closing
Date, and accrued liabilities for any portion of a plan year or other applicable
period shall be determined by multiplying the liability for the entire such year
or period by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of days preceding
the Closing Date in such year or period, and the denominator of which is the
number of days in such year or period, as the case may be. No event has occurred
or circumstance exists that could result in a material increase in the premium
or other benefit cost of any Employee Plan.

         (h) Amendment and Termination. Each Employee Plan may be amended or
terminated at any time by the Company or an ERISA Affiliate.

         (i) Change of Control Payments and Compensation Deduction Limitations.

contemplated hereby will not result in any payment (whether of separation pay or
otherwise), cancellation of indebtedness, or other obligation becoming due from
the Company or any ERISA Affiliate to any current or former employee, director,
or consultant, or result in the vesting, acceleration of payment or increase in
the amount of any benefit payable to or in respect of any such current or former
employee, director, or consultant of the Company or any ERISA Affiliate. There
is no contract, agreement, plan or arrangement covering any current or former
employee, director, or consultant of the Company or any ERISA Affiliate that,
individually or collectively, could give rise to the

payment of any amount that would not be deductible pursuant to the terms of
Sections 162(a)(1), 162(m), and/or 280G of the Code or would require the payment
of an excise tax imposed by Section 4999 of the Code or of any "gross up" of any

         SECTION 6.04. Stockholder Action.

         (a) Following consummation of the Offer, if required by applicable law
in order to consummate the Merger, the Company shall, in accordance with

from its stockholders proxies in favor of the approval of the Merger and

Shares then owned by it, Purchaser or any of Parent's other subsidiaries in

statement pursuant to Regulation 14C under the Exchange Act (the "PROXY
STATEMENT"), (ii) file with the SEC the Proxy Statement and use all reasonable
efforts to respond to the comments of the SEC in connection therewith and to
furnish all information required to prepare the definitive Proxy Statement, and
(iii) as promptly as practicable after responding to all such comments to the
satisfaction of the SEC, cause the definitive Proxy Statement to be mailed to
its respective stockholders, and if necessary, after the definitive Proxy
Statement shall have been mailed, promptly circulate amended, supplemented or
supplemental proxy materials and, if required in connection therewith, resolicit
proxies. The Company shall advise Parent promptly of the receipt of any comments
from the SEC or its staff and of any request by the SEC or its staff for
amendments or supplements to the Proxy Statement or for additional information
and will supply Parent with copies of all correspondence between the Company or
any of its representatives, on the one hand, and the SEC, on the other hand,
with respect to the Proxy Statement or the Merger. If at any time prior to the
Company Stockholders' Meeting there shall occur any event that should be set
forth in an amendment or supplement to the Proxy Statement, the Company shall
promptly prepare and mail to its stockholders such an amendment or supplement.
The Company shall not mail any Proxy Statement, or any amendment or supplement
thereto, to which Parent reasonably objects.

         SECTION 6.06. Regulatory and Other Authorizations; Notices and
Consents. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions hereof, each of the

by this Agreement and (ii) use its reasonable best efforts to (A) take all

         SECTION 6.07. Notice of Certain Matters. Parent shall give prompt
notice to the Company, and the Company shall give prompt notice to Parent, of

nonoccurrence of which would be likely to cause (i) any representation or
warranty contained in this Agreement to be untrue or inaccurate or (ii) any
covenant, condition or agreement contained in this Agreement not to be complied
with or satisfied, and (b) any failure of Parent or the Company, as the case may
be, to comply with or satisfy any covenant, condition or agreement to be
complied with or satisfied by it hereunder. Each of the Company and Parent shall
promptly notify each other of any notice or other communication from any Person
alleging that the consent of such Person (or other Person) is or may be required

or other communication from any Governmental Authority in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

         SECTION 6.08. No Solicitation of Transaction. From the date of this

or other agents to, directly or indirectly, (i) take any action to solicit,
initiate or encourage any Acquisition Proposal or (ii) engage in negotiations
with, or disclose any nonpublic information relating to the Company or the
Company Subsidiaries, respectively, or afford access to their respective
properties, books or records to any Person that may be considering making, or

position with respect to a tender offer by a third party pursuant to Rules 14d-9
and 14e-2(a) promulgated by the SEC under the Exchange Act, or (ii) furnishing
information, including without limitation nonpublic information to, or entering
into negotiations with any Person that has indicated its willingness to make an
unsolicited bona fide Acquisition Proposal, if, and only to the extent that, (A)
such unsolicited bona fide Acquisition Proposal is made by a third party that
the Board of Directors of the Company determines in good faith has the good
faith intent to proceed with negotiations or consider, and financial and other
capability to consummate, such Acquisition Proposal (taking into account among
other things the legal, financial, regulatory and other aspects of such
Acquisition Proposal and the Person making such Acquisition Proposal), (B) the
Board of Directors of the Company, after consultation with outside legal counsel
to the Company, determines in good faith that such action is required for the
Board of Directors of the Company to comply with its fiduciary duties to
stockholders imposed by applicable law, (C) contemporaneously with furnishing
such information to, or entering into discussions or negotiations with, such
Person, the Company provides written notice to Parent to the effect that it is
furnishing information to, or entering into discussions or

negotiations with, such Person and (D) the Company uses all reasonable efforts
to keep Parent informed in all material respects of the status and terms of any
such negotiations or discussions (including without limitation the identity of
the Person with whom such negotiations or discussions are being held) and
provides Parent copies of such written proposals and any amendments or revisions
thereto or correspondence related thereto. The Company, the Company
Subsidiaries, and their respective officers, directors, employees or other
agents shall immediately cease any existing discussions or negotiations, if any,
with any Persons conducted heretofore with respect to any Acquisition Proposal.

         SECTION 6.09. Expenses.

         (a) Except as provided in Section 8.02, all Expenses (as defined below)
incurred by the parties hereto shall be borne solely and entirely by the party
that has incurred such Expenses; provided, however, that if this Agreement is
terminated for any reason, then the allocable share of Parent and the Company
for all Expenses (including any fees and expenses of accountants, experts, and
consultants, but excluding the fees and expenses of legal counsel and investment
bankers) related to preparing, printing, filing and mailing the Offer Documents,
the Proxy Statement and all SEC and other regulatory filing fees incurred in
connection with the Offer Documents and the Proxy Statement shall be allocated
one-half each.

         (b) "EXPENSES" as used in this Agreement shall include all reasonable
out-of-pocket expenses (including, without limitation, all reasonable fees and
expenses of counsel, accountants, investment bankers, experts and consultants to
a party hereto and its Affiliates) incurred by a party or on its behalf in
connection with or related to the authorization, preparation, negotiation,
execution and performance of this Agreement, the preparation, printing, filing

Corporation shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless each person who is now, or
has been at any time prior to the date hereof, or who becomes prior to the
Effective Time, an officer or director of the Company or any Company Subsidiary
(each, an "INDEMNIFIED Party") against all losses, claims, damages, liabilities,
fees and expenses (including reasonable fees and disbursements of counsel and
judgments, fines losses, claims, liabilities and amounts paid in settlement
(provided that any such settlement is effected with the prior written consent of
Parent or the Surviving Corporation, which consent will not be unreasonably
withheld)) arising in whole or in part out of actions or omissions in their
capacity as such occurring at or prior to the Effective Time to the fullest
extent permitted under Nevada law and the Surviving Corporation's Articles of
Incorporation and Bylaws and the Company's written indemnification agreements in
effect at the date hereof and listed on Section 6.10 of the Disclosure Letter,
including provisions therein relating to the advancement of expenses incurred in
the defense of any action or suit; provided, that in the event any claim or
claims are asserted or made within such six year period, all rights to
indemnification in respect of any such claim or claims shall continue until
disposition of any and

all such claims, provided that in no event shall the liability of Parent and the
Surviving Corporation in the aggregate under this Section 6.10(a) exceed
$115,000,000.00.

         (b) Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to maintain the
Company's existing officers' and directors' liability insurance policy ("D&O
INSURANCE") for a period of not less than six years after the Effective Time,
but only to the extent related to actions or omissions prior to the Effective
Time; provided, that the Surviving Corporation may substitute therefor policies
of substantially similar coverage and amounts containing terms no less
advantageous to such former directors or officers; provided further, that the
annual premiums to be paid with respect to the maintenance of such D&O Insurance
during such six year period shall not exceed two hundred percent (200%) of the
premium paid by the Company for such D&O Insurance during the year ended
December 31, 2000, it being agreed and understood that if such policies cannot
be obtained at such cost, Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to obtain
as much of such policies as can be obtained at a cost equal to such amount.

         (c) The Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws of the Surviving
Corporation and each subsidiary thereof shall contain provisions no less
favorable with respect to indemnification than are currently set forth in the
Bylaws of the Company and any Company Subsidiary, which provisions shall not be
amended, repealed or otherwise modified for a period of six years from the
Effective Time in any manner that would affect adversely the rights thereunder
of individuals who, at or prior to the Effective Time, were Indemnified Parties,
unless such modification shall be required by Law. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, the Surviving Corporation shall not be obligated to maintain the
provisions of the Company's and Company Subsidiaries' Bylaws and Articles of
Incorporation that provide for indemnification of directors and officers in
their capacities as stockholders.

         SECTION 6.11. Cooperation and Filings.

by any other party hereto, and shall promptly provide the other party or its
counsel with copies of all filings made by such party with any Governmental
Authority in connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated
hereby

         SECTION 6.12. Publicity. Neither the Company, Parent nor any of their
respective Affiliates shall issue or cause the publication of any press release
or other announcement with respect to the Offer, the Merger, this Agreement or
the other transactions contemplated hereby without a prior consultation of the

national securities exchange and will use reasonable efforts to provide copies
of such release or other announcement to the other party hereto, and give due
consideration to such comments as the other party may have, prior to such
release.

         SECTION 6.13. Additional Actions. Subject to the terms and conditions
of this Agreement, each of the parties hereto agrees to use all reasonable
efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all action and to do, or cause to be
done, all things necessary, proper or advisable under applicable Laws, or to
remove any injunctions or other impediments or delays, to consummate and make

                             TERMINATION AND WAIVER

         SECTION 8.01. Termination. This Agreement may be terminated and the
Merger may be abandoned at any time prior to the Effective Time, whether before
or after approval by the stockholders of the Company:

         (a) by the mutual written consent of Parent and the Company;

         (b) by either Parent or the Company if the Effective Time shall not
have occurred on or before May 31, 2001 (the "TERMINATION DATE"); provided that
the party seeking to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 8.01(b)
shall not have breached in any material respect its obligations under this
Agreement in any manner that shall have proximately contributed to the failure
to consummate the Merger on or before the Terminated Date;

         (c) by the Company if there has been a material breach by Parent or
Purchaser of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement set forth in
this Agreement which breach (if susceptible to cure) has not been cured in all
material respects within five Business Days following receipt by Parent or
Purchaser of notice of such breach;

         (d) by either Parent or the Company if any court of competent
jurisdiction or other Governmental Authority shall have issued an order, decree
or ruling or taken any other action permanently enjoining, restraining or
otherwise prohibiting the acceptance for payment of, or payment for, Common
Shares or Preferred Shares pursuant to the Offer or the Merger and such order,

its recommendation of the Offer, this Agreement or the Merger in a manner
adverse to Parent or shall have resolved to do any of the foregoing, (B) shall
have recommended to the stockholders of the Company any Acquisition Proposal or
resolved to do so or (C) shall have failed to reaffirm publicly and

Person (including the Company or any of its Affiliates), other than Parent or
any of its Affiliates, shall have become the beneficial owner of more than 50%
of the Common Shares or 50% of the Preferred Shares; provided, however, the
current ownership of Shares by the Company's stockholders who are party to
either the Tender Agreement or the Tender and Voting Agreement shall not be
deemed to trigger this clause (B);

         (f) by the Company, if, prior to the acceptance of and payment for the
Shares pursuant to the Offer, the Company's Board of Directors shall have
determined to recommend a Superior Proposal and the Company makes the payment of
the Termination Fee as required

pursuant to Section 8.02 of this Agreement and of the Expense Fee for which the
Company is responsible under Section 8.02 of this Agreement. For purposes of
this Agreement, "SUPERIOR PROPOSAL" means an unsolicited bona fide proposal made
by a third party relating to an Acquisition Proposal on terms that the Board of
Directors of the Company determines it cannot reject in favor of the Offer and
the Merger, based on applicable fiduciary duties and after consultation with the
Company's outside counsel (taking into account among other things the legal,
financial, regulatory and other aspects of the Acquisition Proposal, the Person
making such Acquisition Proposal, the likelihood of consummation and the time
required to complete such transaction); provided, however, that the Company
shall not be permitted to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section
8.01(f) unless it has complied with Section 6.08 and used all reasonable efforts
to provide Parent with two Business Days prior written notice of its intent to
so terminate this Agreement together with a detailed summary of the terms and
conditions of such Acquisition Proposal; provided further, that prior to any
such termination, the Company shall, and shall cause its respective financial
and legal advisors to, negotiate in good faith with Parent to make such
adjustments in the terms and conditions of this Agreement as would enable the
Company to proceed with the transactions contemplated herein, and it is
acknowledged by Parent that such negotiations with Parent shall be conducted in
a manner consistent with the fiduciary duties of the Company's Board of
Directors.

         (g) by the Company if (i) Purchaser fails to commence the Offer in
violation of Section 2.01 hereof, provided, however, that the Company may not
terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 8.01(g) if the Company has
materially breached this Agreement, or (ii) Purchaser fails to purchase validly
tendered Shares in violation of the terms of this Agreement;

         (h) by Parent or the Company if the Offer is terminated or withdrawn or
shall have expired pursuant to its terms without any Shares being purchased
thereunder; provided, however, that neither Parent nor the Company may terminate
this Agreement pursuant to this Section 8.01(h) if such party (or in the case of
Parent, Purchaser) shall have materially breached this Agreement;

         (i) by Parent if the Company shall have breached any of its
representations or warranties which breach would give rise to the failure of the
condition set forth in clause (e) of Annex I hereto to be satisfied or if, prior
to consummation of the Offer, the Company shall have failed to perform its
covenants or other agreements contained in this Agreement which failure to
perform would give rise to the failure of the condition set forth in clause (e)
of Annex I hereto to be satisfied, which breach or failure to perform is
incapable of being cured or has not been cured by the date that is five Business
Days following written notice thereof to the Company from Parent.

         SECTION 8.02. Effect of Termination.

9.08, 9.11, 9.12 and 9.13, provided that nothing herein shall relieve any party
from liability for any breaches hereof.

         (b) In the event that this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section
8.01(e)(i) (other than Section 8.01(e)(i)(A) if no Acquisition Proposal shall
have been publicly announced or disclosed) or Section 8.01(f), then the Company
shall promptly (and in any event within one Business Day after such termination
or, in the case of any such termination by the Company, prior to such
termination) pay Parent an amount equal to (i) a termination fee of
$5,200,000.00 (the "TERMINATION FEE"), provided, however, that in no event shall
more than one Termination Fee be payable by the Company plus (ii) Parent's
aggregate Expenses up to $500,000.00 (the "EXPENSE FEE").

         (c) In the event that this Agreement is terminated pursuant to (i)
Section 8.01(e)(i)(A) (if no Acquisition Proposal shall have been publicly
announced or disclosed) and within 12 months of the date of termination of this
Agreement a transaction constituting an Acquisition Proposal is consummated, the
Company shall, prior to or simultaneously with the consummation of such
transaction, pay Parent the Termination Fee and the Expense Fee or (ii) Section
8.01(e)(ii) hereof and within 12 months of the date of termination of this
Agreement either (A) a transaction constituting an Acquisition Proposal is

than 50% of the Common Shares or 50% of the Preferred Shares, the Company shall,
prior to or simultaneously with the consummation of such transaction or the
acquisition of such Common Shares or Preferred Shares, pay Parent the
Termination Fee and the Expense Fee; provided, however, the current ownership of
Shares by the Company's stockholders who are party to either the Tender
Agreement or the Tender and Voting Agreement shall not be deemed to trigger this
clause (B); and provided further that the acquisition of additional Preferred
Shares by any of the current holders of Preferred Shares by virtue of a transfer
or purchase of such Preferred Shares from another current holder of Preferred
Shares shall not be deemed to trigger this clause (B).

         (d) In no event shall the Company be obligated to pay more than one
Termination Fee and Expense Fee pursuant to this Section 8.02.

                                  ARTICLE IX.

         The foregoing conditions (including those set forth in clauses (i),
(ii) and (iii) of the initial paragraph) are for the benefit of Parent and
Purchaser and may be asserted by Parent or Purchaser regardless of the
circumstances giving rise to any such conditions and other than clauses (i) and
(ii) may be waived by Parent or Purchaser, in whole or in part, at any time and
from time to time in their reasonable discretion, in each case, subject to the
terms of the Merger Agreement. The conditions in clauses (i) and (ii) of the
initial paragraph may not be waived without the written consent of the Company.
The failure by Parent or Purchaser at any time to exercise any of the foregoing
rights shall not be deemed a waiver of any such right and each such right shall
be deemed an ongoing right which may be asserted at any time and from time to
time.

         SECTION 1. Agreement to Tender and to Vote.

         1.1 Tender. Each Stockholder hereby agrees, severally (and not
jointly), to validly tender (or cause the record owner of such Tender Shares to
validly tender), pursuant to and in accordance with the terms of the Offer, as
soon as practicable after commencement of the Offer but in no event later than
ten Business Days after the date of commencement of the Offer, its Tender Shares

dividends pursuant to Section 4.17 of the Preferred Stock Purchase Agreement).
Each Stockholder hereby agrees and acknowledges that it will have no rights to
dividends on its Preferred Shares payable on or at any time subsequent to the
purchase of such Preferred Shares pursuant to the Offer. Each Stockholder
further acknowledges and agrees that Parent's and Purchaser's obligation to
accept for payment and pay for the Tender Shares is subject to the terms and
conditions of the Offer. Each Stockholder hereby permits

Parent and Purchaser to publish and disclose in the Offer Documents and, if
approval of the Company's stockholders is required under applicable law, the
Proxy Statement (including all documents and schedules filed with the SEC) its
identity and ownership of the Tender Shares and the nature of its commitments,
arrangements and understandings under this Agreement.

         1.2 Voting. Each Stockholder hereby severally (and not jointly) agrees
that, during the time this Agreement is in effect, at any meeting of the
stockholders of the Company, however called, or in any other circumstance in
which the vote, consent or approval of stockholders of the Company is sought,
such Stockholder shall (i) vote the Tender Shares to approve and vote in favor
of the Merger Agreement; (ii) vote the Tender Shares against any action or
agreement that would result in a breach of any covenant, representation or
warranty or any other obligation or agreement of the Company under the Merger
Agreement; and (iii) vote the Tender Shares against any action or agreement
(other than the Merger Agreement or the transactions contemplated thereby) that
would impede, interfere with, delay, postpone or attempt to discourage the
Merger or the Offer, including, but not limited to: (1) any extraordinary
corporate transaction, such as a merger, consolidation or other business
combination involving the Company or any of its subsidiaries; (2) a sale or
transfer of a material amount of assets of the Company or any of the Company
Subsidiaries or a reorganization, recapitalization or liquidation of the Company
and the Company Subsidiaries; (3) any change in the management or board of
directors of the Company, except as otherwise agreed to in writing by Purchaser;
(4) any material change in the present capitalization or dividend policy of the
Company; or (5) any other material change in the Company's corporate structure
or business.

         1.3 Grant of Irrevocable Proxy; Appointment of Proxy.

             (a) Each Stockholder hereby irrevocably grants to, and appoints
Parent such Stockholder's proxy and attorney-in-fact (with full power of
substitution), for and in the name, place and stead of such Stockholder, to vote
the Tender Shares to approve and vote in favor of the Offer, the Merger
Agreement and the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, against any
Acquisition Proposal and otherwise as contemplated by Section 1.2.

             (b) Each Stockholder severally (and not jointly) represents that
any proxies heretofore given in respect of the Tender Shares are revocable, and
that any such proxies are hereby revoked.

             (c) Each Stockholder severally (and not jointly) understands and
acknowledges that Parent is entering into the Merger Agreement in reliance upon
such Stockholder's execution and delivery of this Agreement. Each Stockholder
severally (and not jointly) hereby affirms that the irrevocable proxy set forth
in this Section 1.3 is given in connection with the execution of the Merger
Agreement and affirms that the irrevocable proxy is coupled with an interest and
may under no circumstances be revoked until the termination of this Agreement
pursuant to Section 2. Each Stockholder severally (and not jointly) hereby
ratifies and confirms all that such irrevocable proxy may lawfully do or cause
to be done by virtue hereof. THIS PROXY AND POWER OF ATTORNEY IS IRREVOCABLE AND
COUPLED WITH AN INTEREST AND, EXCEPT AS SET FORTH IN SECTION 2, IS EXECUTED AND
INTENDED TO BE IRREVOCABLE IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE PROVISIONS OF SECTION 78.355
OF THE NEVADA REVISED STATUTES. Each Stockholder shall execute

and deliver to Parent any proxy cards that such Stockholder receives to vote in
favor of the consummation of the Merger. Parent shall deliver to the Secretary
of the Company any such proxy cards received by it at any meeting called to
approve the consummation of the Merger.

         1.4 No Inconsistent Arrangements. Each Stockholder severally (and not
jointly) hereby covenants and agrees that, except as contemplated by this
Agreement and the Merger Agreement, it shall not (i) except to Purchaser,
transfer (which term shall include, without limitation, any sale, gift, pledge
or other disposition), or consent to any transfer of, any or all of the Company
Options, Company Warrants or Tender Shares or any interest therein, (ii) except
with Parent, enter into any contract, option or other agreement or understanding
with respect to any transfer of any or all of the Company Options, Company
Warrants or Tender Shares or any interest therein, (iii) grant any proxy,
power-of-attorney or other authorization in or with respect to the Company
Options, Company Warrants or Tender Shares, (iv) deposit any Company Options,
Company Warrants or Tender Shares into a voting trust or enter into a voting
agreement or arrangement with respect to the Tender Shares, (v) with respect to
any Stockholder that is a holder of Company Preferred Stock, (A) elect, under
Section 3(C) of the Designation of Preferences, Limitations and Rights of Series
A Convertible Preferred Stock of the Company (the "DESIGNATION"), to have the
Offer or Merger or any of the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby
treated as a Liquidation (as defined in the Designation) or (B) convert any
Preferred Shares held by such Stockholder into any other series or class of
securities of the Company or (vi) take any other action that would in any way
restrict, limit or interfere with the performance of its obligations hereunder
or the transactions contemplated hereby or by the Merger Agreement or which
would make any representation or warranty of such Stockholder hereunder untrue
or incorrect.

         1.5 No Solicitation. Each Stockholder severally (and not jointly)
hereby agrees that it shall not, and shall not permit or authorize any of its
affiliates, representatives or agents to, directly or indirectly, encourage,
solicit, explore, participate in or initiate discussions or negotiations with,
or provide or disclose any information to, any Person or group (other than
Parent, Purchaser or any of their affiliates or representatives) concerning any
Acquisition Proposal or enter into any agreement, arrangement or understanding
requiring the Company to abandon, terminate or fail to consummate the Offer, the
Merger or any other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement. Each
Stockholder will immediately cease any existing activities, discussions or
negotiations with any parties conducted heretofore with respect to any
Acquisition Proposal. From and after the execution of this Agreement, each
Stockholder shall immediately advise Parent in writing of the receipt, directly
or indirectly, of any inquiries, discussions, negotiations or proposals relating
to an Acquisition Proposal, identify the offeror and furnish to Parent a copy of
any such proposal or inquiry, if it is in writing, or a written summary of any
oral proposal or inquiry relating to an Acquisition Proposal. Such Stockholder
shall promptly advise Parent in writing of any development relating to such
proposal, including the results of any discussions or negotiations with respect
thereto. Any action taken by the Company or any member of the Board of Directors
of the Company including, if applicable, any representative of any Stockholder
acting in such capacity, in accordance with the second sentence of Section 6.08
of the Merger Agreement shall be deemed not to violate this Section 1.5.

         1.6 Reasonable Best Efforts. Subject to the terms and conditions of
this Agreement, each Stockholder severally (and not jointly) hereby agrees to
use all reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and
to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable under
applicable laws and regulations to consummate and make effective the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Each Stockholder shall promptly
consult with Parent and provide any necessary information and material with
respect to all filings made by such Stockholder with any Governmental Authority
in connection with this Agreement and the Merger Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby and thereby.

         1.7 Waiver of Appraisal Rights. Each Stockholder hereby waives any
rights of appraisal or rights to dissent from the Merger that it may have.

         1.8 Payment for Tender Shares in Excess of the Offer Price. Each
Stockholder severally (and not jointly) hereby agrees that, if the Merger
Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 8.01(e) or (f) of the Merger
Agreement, fifty percent (50%) of any incremental value such Stockholder
actually receives for its equity in the Company (including but not limited to
any Shares, Company Options and Company Warrants beneficially Owned by such
Stockholder) resulting from or attributable to an Acquisition Proposal (other
than with Parent or Purchaser) that is entered into or consummated within six
months of the termination of the Merger Agreement that exceeds $8.25 per Common
Share or $18.04 per Preferred Share (100% of such excess amount with respect to
the Common Shares, Company Options, Company Warrants and the Preferred Shares,
as applicable, collectively referred to as the "EXCESS AMOUNT") shall belong to
Parent. Each Stockholder severally (and not jointly) accordingly agrees to hold
in trust for the benefit of Parent, and to remit to Parent (in the same form of
consideration as received by the Stockholder) within three Business Days of any
receipt thereof, fifty percent (50%) of any Excess Amount or Amounts that such
Stockholder actually receives from any Person. In the event of any change in the
number of issued and outstanding Shares by reason of any stock dividend,
subdivision, merger, recapitalization, combination, conversion or exchange of
shares, or any other change in the corporate or capital structure of the Company
(including, without limitation, the declaration or payment of a dividend of cash
or securities) which would have the effect of diluting or otherwise adversely
affecting Parent's rights and privileges under this Section 1.8, the Excess
Amount due hereunder shall be appropriately and equitably adjusted to restore to
Parent its rights and privileges under this Section 1.8. Each Stockholder
severally (and not jointly) hereby agrees to reimburse Parent and Purchaser for
any fees and expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees) incurred by Parent
and Purchaser in connection with any successful litigation, dispute or other
attempt to recover the portion of the Excess Amount due from such Stockholder
pursuant to this Section 1.8 in the event that Stockholder fails to deliver such
Excess Amount to Parent upon written demand.

         1.9 Transfer of Company Options and Company Warrants. Each Stockholder
holding Company Options or Company Warrants severally (and not jointly) agrees
that so long as this Agreement shall remain in effect, such Stockholder (for
purposes of this Section 1.9, an "OPTIONHOLDER") will not transfer or exercise
any Company Options or Company Warrants held by such Optionholder except to an
Affiliate of such Stockholder that becomes a party to this Agreement or a
similar agreement; provided, however, that each Optionholder agrees to accept at
the Effective Time (as defined in the Merger Agreement) an amount in respect of
such Company Options equal to the Company Option Payments and an amount in
respect of such Company

Warrants equal to the Company Warrant Payments, and each such Company Option and
Company Warrant shall thereafter be canceled. Nothing in this Agreement shall
limit the ability of the holders of Company Options or Company Warrants to
exercise such securities in accordance with their terms, provided that such
holder tenders the shares of Company Common Stock issued upon exercise thereof
in the Offer.

         1.10 Special Provision Applicable Only to the EnCap Stockholders. Each
EnCap Stockholder hereby acknowledges that no EnCap Put Right exists with
respect to any Tender Shares now or hereafter Owned by such Stockholder.

         1.11 Special Provision Applicable Only to First Union. Subject to the
termination provisions of Section 2 of this Agreement, First Union hereby
irrevocably waives the First Union Put Right with respect to any and all Tender
Shares now or hereafter Owned by such Stockholder.

         1.12 Special Provision Applicable Only to V&C. Subject to the
termination provisions of Section 2 of this Agreement, V&C hereby irrevocably
waives the V&C Management Rights and agrees and acknowledges that neither
Parent, Purchaser nor the Surviving Corporation will have any continuing
obligation to V&C with respect to such V&C Management Rights or any similar
special right to control or effect the affairs or activities of the Surviving
Corporation or its Affiliates.

         SECTION 2. Effectiveness; Termination. This Agreement shall become
effective as to each Stockholder upon its execution by such Stockholder, Parent
and Purchaser and upon the execution of the Merger Agreement. This Agreement may
be terminated as to each Stockholder at any time by mutual written consent of
such Stockholder, Parent and Purchaser. Other than the provisions of Section 1.8
and Section 6, this Agreement shall terminate, without any action by the parties
hereto, on the date on which the Merger Agreement terminates in accordance with
its terms.

         SECTION 3. Representations and Warranties.

         3.1 Representations and Warranties of Stockholders. Each Stockholder
hereby represents and warrants, severally (and not jointly), to Parent and
Purchaser as follows:

             (a) Title. Such Stockholder has good and valid title to the Owned
Shares of such Stockholder, free and clear of any lien, pledge, charge,
encumbrance or claim of whatever nature and, upon the purchase of the Tender
Shares by Purchaser, such Stockholder will deliver good and valid title to the
Tender Shares, free and clear of any lien, charge, encumbrance or claim of
whatever nature.

             (b) No Other Rights. Except for this Agreement and as shown on
Schedule I hereto, there are no outstanding options, warrants or rights to
purchase or acquire the Shares of such Stockholder.

             (c) Ownership of Shares. On the date hereof, the Owned Shares of
such Stockholder are owned of record or beneficially by such Stockholder and, on
the date hereof, such Owned Shares of such Stockholder constitute all of the
Shares owned of record or

beneficially by such Stockholder. Such Stockholder has sole voting power and
sole power of disposition with respect to all of the Owned Shares of such
Stockholder, with no restrictions, subject to applicable federal securities
laws, on such Stockholder's rights of disposition pertaining thereto.

             (d) Power; Binding Agreement. Such Stockholder has the legal
capacity, and all the necessary power and authority to enter into and perform
all of its obligations under this Agreement. The execution, delivery and
performance of this Agreement by such Stockholder will not violate any other
agreement to which such Stockholder is a party including, without limitation,
any voting agreement, stockholders agreement or voting trust. This Agreement has
been duly and validly executed and delivered by such Stockholder, and assuming
this Agreement has been duly and validly authorized, executed and delivered by
each party hereto other than such Stockholder, this Agreement constitutes a
valid and binding agreement of such Stockholder, enforceable against such
Stockholder in accordance with its terms, except that (i) such enforcement may
be subject to applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium, or
similar laws, now or hereafter in effect, affecting creditor rights generally
and (ii) the remedy of specific performance and injunctive and other equitable
relief may be subject to equitable defenses and to the discretion of the court.

             (e) No Conflicts. Other than in connection with or in compliance
with the provisions of the Exchange Act, no authorization, consent or approval
of, or filing with, any court or any public body or authority is necessary for
the consummation by such Stockholder of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. The execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement and the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby will not constitute a
breach, violation or default (or any event which, with notice or lapse of time
or both, would constitute a default) under, or result in the termination of, or
accelerate the performance required by, or result in a right of termination or
acceleration under, or result in the creation of any lien, encumbrance, pledge,
charge or claim upon any of the properties or assets of such Stockholder under,
(i) the certificate of incorporation or other organizational documents of such
Stockholder, if any, or (ii) any note, bond, mortgage, indenture, deed of trust,
license, lease, agreement or other instrument to which such Stockholder is a
party or by which its properties or assets are bound.

             (f) No Finder's Fees. No broker, investment banker, financial
advisor or other Person is entitled to any broker's, finder's, financial
adviser's or other similar fee or commission in connection with the transactions
contemplated hereby based upon arrangements made by or on behalf of such
Stockholder.

         3.2 Representations and Warranties of Parent and Purchaser. Each of
Parent and Purchaser hereby represent and warrant to each Stockholder that the
Offer, the Offer Documents and the transactions contemplated thereby will comply
in all material respects with the provisions of applicable federal securities
laws. Parent and Purchaser further represent that the Offer Documents, on the
date filed with the SEC and on the date first published, sent or given to the
Stockholders, will not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit
to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order
to make the statements made therein, in light of the circumstances under which
they were made, not misleading, except that no representation is made by Parent
or Purchaser with respect to information supplied by the

Company for inclusion in the Offer Documents. Each of Parent and Purchaser agree
and acknowledge that the Stockholders are entering into this Agreement in
material reliance on this Section 3.2.

         SECTION 4. Additional Shares. Each Stockholder hereby agrees, while
this Agreement is in effect, to promptly notify Parent of the number of any new
Shares acquired by such Stockholder, if any, after the date hereof.

         SECTION 5. Further Assurances. From time to time, at the Parent's
request and without further consideration, each Stockholder shall execute and
deliver such additional documents and take all such further action as may be
reasonably necessary or desirable to carry out the provisions of this Agreement.

         SECTION 6. Miscellaneous.

         6.1 Non-Survival. The representations and warranties made by a
Stockholder herein shall terminate upon the termination of this Agreement, other
than such Stockholder's representations and warranties in Sections 3(a) through
(c) which shall survive the termination of this Agreement.

         6.2 Entire Agreement; Assignment. This Agreement (i) constitutes the
entire agreement between the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof
and supersedes all other prior agreements and understandings, both written and
oral, between the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and (ii)
shall not be assigned by operation of law or otherwise, provided that Parent may
assign its rights and obligations hereunder to any direct or indirect wholly
owned subsidiary of Parent, but no such assignment shall relieve Parent of its
obligations hereunder if such assignee does not perform such obligations.

         6.3 Waiver and Amendments. Any provision of this Agreement may be
waived at any time by the party which is entitled to the benefits thereof and
this Agreement may be amended or supplemented at any time. No such waiver,
amendment or supplement shall be effective unless in writing and signed by the

         6.5 Governing Law; Jurisdiction. This Agreement shall be governed by

the defense of an inconvenient forum to the maintenance of such action or
proceeding.

         6.6 Specific Performance. Each Stockholder recognizes and acknowledges

agreements and injunctive and other equitable relief in addition to any other

to affect the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement.

         6.9 Severability. Whenever possible, each provision or portion of any
provision of this Agreement will be interpreted in such manner as to be

provision of this Agreement is held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable in
any respect under any applicable law or rule in any jurisdiction, such
invalidity, illegality or unenforceability will not affect any other provision
or portion of any provision in such jurisdiction, and this Agreement will be
reformed, construed and enforced in such jurisdiction as if such invalid,
illegal or unenforceable provision or portion of any provision had never been
contained herein.

         6.10 Expenses. Each of the parties shall pay its own expenses in
connection with the negotiation, execution and performance of this Agreement.

TENDER AGREEMENT, DATED 1/18/01

                                                                  EXHIBIT (d)(3)

                                TENDER AGREEMENT

         TENDER AGREEMENT (this "AGREEMENT"), dated as of January 18, 2001, by
and between Ocean Energy, Inc., a Texas corporation ("PARENT"), OEI Acquisition
Corp. (the "PURCHASER"), a Nevada corporation and a wholly-owned subsidiary of
Parent, and the stockholders set forth in Schedule I hereto (each, a
"STOCKHOLDER" and collectively, the "STOCKHOLDERS").

         WHEREAS, concurrently herewith, Parent, Purchaser and Texoil, Inc. (the
"COMPANY"), a Nevada corporation, are entering into an Agreement and Plan of
Merger of even date herewith (the "MERGER AGREEMENT") (capitalized terms used
but not defined herein shall have the meanings set forth in the Merger
Agreement), pursuant to which Purchaser has agreed to commence a tender offer
(the "OFFER") to purchase (i) all of the outstanding shares (the "COMMON
SHARES") of the Company's common stock, par value $0.01 per share ("COMPANY
COMMON STOCK"), at a price per Common Share of $8.25 (such price or such higher
price as may be paid for Common Shares in the Offer, the "OFFER PRICE") net to
the seller in cash and (ii) all of the outstanding shares (the "PREFERRED
SHARES") of the Company's Series A Convertible Preferred Stock, par value $0.01
per share ("COMPANY PREFERRED STOCK"), at a price per Preferred Share of $18.04
(such price or such higher price as may be paid for Preferred Shares in the
Offer, the "PREFERRED OFFER PRICE") net to the seller in cash;

         WHEREAS, as of the date hereof, each Stockholder owns, beneficially and
of record, the outstanding shares of Common Stock, Preferred Stock, the options
to purchase Common Stock the ("COMPANY OPTIONS") and warrants convertible into
Common Stock (the "COMPANY WARRANTS") set forth opposite such Stockholder's name
on Schedule I hereto; provided, however, that any shares held in a fiduciary
capacity for the benefit of others by any Stockholder that is a financial
institution or its Affiliates shall not be subject to this Agreement;

         WHEREAS, as a condition to their willingness to enter into the Merger
Agreement and make the Offer, Parent and Purchaser have required that each
Stockholder agree, and in order to induce Parent and Purchaser to enter into the
Merger Agreement, each Stockholder hereby agrees, (i) to tender pursuant to the
Offer the Common Shares and the Preferred Shares now legally and/or beneficially
owned ("OWNED") by such Stockholder (the "OWNED SHARES"), together with any
Shares acquired after the date hereof and prior to the termination of the Offer,
whether upon the exercise of Company Options, Company Warrants, conversion of
convertible securities or otherwise (collectively, the "TENDER SHARES") on the
terms and subject to the conditions provided for in this Agreement and (ii) to
enter into the other agreements set forth herein; and

         WHEREAS, there are no prior agreements, arrangements or understandings
with respect to the subject matter hereof or the Merger Agreement.

         NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and for other good and
valuable consideration given to each party hereto, the receipt of which is
hereby acknowledged, the parties agree as follows:

SECTION 1. Agreement to Tender.

         1.1 Tender. Each Stockholder hereby agrees, severally (and not
jointly), to validly tender (or cause the record owner of such Tender Shares to
validly tender), pursuant to and in accordance with the terms of the Offer, as
soon as practicable after commencement of the Offer but in no event later than
ten Business Days after the date of commencement of the Offer, its Tender Shares
by physical delivery of the certificates therefor and to not withdraw such
Tender Shares, except following termination of the Offer pursuant to its terms.
Any Preferred Shares tendered pursuant to this Section 1.1 and acquired pursuant
to the Offer will include, by way of amplification and not limitation, all
rights associated with such Shares, including but not limited to all cash and
non-cash dividends, distributions, rights, other Shares or other securities
issued or issuable in respect thereof on or after the date of this Agreement
(including, without limitation, with respect to the Preferred Shares, rights to
dividends pursuant to Section 4.17 of the Preferred Stock Purchase Agreement).
Each Stockholder hereby agrees and acknowledges that it will have no rights to
dividends on its Preferred Shares payable on or at any time subsequent to the
purchase of such Preferred Shares pursuant to the Offer. Each Stockholder
further acknowledges and agrees that Parent's and Purchaser's obligation to
accept for payment and pay for the Tender Shares is subject to the terms and
conditions of the Offer. Each Stockholder hereby permits Parent and Purchaser to
publish and disclose in the Offer Documents and, if approval of the Company's
stockholders is required under applicable law, the Proxy Statement (including
all documents and schedules filed with the SEC) its identity and ownership of
the Tender Shares and the nature of its commitments, arrangements and
understandings under this Agreement.

         1.2 No Inconsistent Arrangements. Each Stockholder severally (and not
jointly) hereby covenants and agrees that, except as contemplated by this
Agreement and the Merger Agreement, it shall not (i) except to Purchaser,
transfer (which term shall include, without limitation, any sale, gift, pledge
or other disposition), or consent to any transfer of, any or all of the Company
Options, Company Warrants or Tender Shares or any interest therein, (ii) except
with Parent, enter into any contract, option or other agreement or understanding
with respect to any transfer of any or all of the Company Options, Company
Warrants or Tender Shares or any interest therein, (iii) grant any proxy,
power-of-attorney or other authorization in or with respect to the Company
Options, Company Warrants or Tender Shares, (iv) deposit any Company Options,
Company Warrants or Tender Shares into a voting trust or enter into a voting
agreement or arrangement with respect to the Tender Shares, (v) with respect to
any Stockholder that is a holder of Company Preferred Stock, (A) elect, under
Section 3(C) of the Designation of Preferences, Limitations and Rights of Series
A Convertible Preferred Stock of the Company (the "DESIGNATION"), to have the
Offer or Merger or any of the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby
treated as a Liquidation (as defined in the Designation) or (B) convert any
Preferred Shares held by such Stockholder into any other series or class of
securities of the Company or (vi) take any other action that would in any way
restrict, limit or interfere with the performance of its obligations hereunder
or the transactions contemplated hereby or by the Merger Agreement or which
would make any representation or warranty of such Stockholder hereunder untrue
or incorrect.

         1.3 No Solicitation. Each Stockholder severally (and not jointly)
hereby agrees that it shall not, and shall not permit or authorize any of its
affiliates, representatives or agents to, directly or indirectly, encourage,
solicit, explore, participate in or initiate discussions or

negotiations with, or provide or disclose any information to, any Person or
group (other than Parent, Purchaser or any of their affiliates or
representatives) concerning any Acquisition Proposal or enter into any
agreement, arrangement or understanding requiring the Company to abandon,
terminate or fail to consummate the Offer, the Merger or any other transactions
contemplated by the Merger Agreement. Each Stockholder will immediately cease
any existing activities, discussions or negotiations with any parties conducted
heretofore with respect to any Acquisition Proposal. From and after the
execution of this Agreement, each Stockholder shall immediately advise Parent in
writing of the receipt, directly or indirectly, of any inquiries, discussions,
negotiations or proposals relating to an Acquisition Proposal, identify the
offeror and furnish to Parent a copy of any such proposal or inquiry, if it is
in writing, or a written summary of any oral proposal or inquiry relating to an
Acquisition Proposal. Such Stockholder shall promptly advise Parent in writing
of any development relating to such proposal, including the results of any
discussions or negotiations with respect thereto. Any action taken by the
Company or any member of the Board of Directors of the Company including, if
applicable, any representative of any Stockholder acting in such capacity, in
accordance with the second sentence of Section 6.08 of the Merger Agreement
shall be deemed not to violate this Section 1.3.

         1.4 Reasonable Best Efforts. Subject to the terms and conditions of
this Agreement, each Stockholder severally (and not jointly) hereby agrees to
use all reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and
to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable under
applicable laws and regulations to consummate and make effective the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Each Stockholder shall promptly
consult with Parent and provide any necessary information and material with
respect to all filings made by such Stockholder with any Governmental Authority
in connection with this Agreement and the Merger Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby and thereby.

         1.5 Waiver of Appraisal Rights. Each Stockholder hereby waives any
rights of appraisal or rights to dissent from the Merger that it may have.

         1.6 Payment for Tender Shares in Excess of the Offer Price. Each
Stockholder severally (and not jointly) hereby agrees that, if the Merger
Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 8.01(e) or (f) of the Merger
Agreement, fifty percent (50%) of any incremental value such Stockholder
actually receives for its equity in the Company (including but not limited to
any Shares, Company Options and Company Warrants beneficially Owned by such
Stockholder) resulting from or attributable to an Acquisition Proposal (other
than with Parent or Purchaser) that is entered into or consummated within six
months of the termination of the Merger Agreement that exceeds $8.25 per Common
Share or $18.04 per Preferred Share (100% of such excess amount with respect to
the Common Shares, Company Options, Company Warrants and the Preferred Shares,
as applicable, collectively referred to as the "EXCESS AMOUNT") shall belong to
Parent. Each Stockholder severally (and not jointly) accordingly agrees to hold
in trust for the benefit of Parent, and to remit to Parent (in the same form of
consideration as received by the Stockholder) within three Business Days of any
receipt thereof, fifty percent (50%) of any Excess Amount or Amounts that such
Stockholder actually receives from any Person. In the event of any change in the
number of issued and outstanding Shares by reason of any stock dividend,
subdivision, merger, recapitalization, combination, conversion or exchange of
shares, or any other change in the corporate or capital structure of the Company
(including, without

limitation, the declaration or payment of a dividend of cash or securities)
which would have the effect of diluting or otherwise adversely affecting
Parent's rights and privileges under this Section 1.6, the Excess Amount due
hereunder shall be appropriately and equitably adjusted to restore to Parent its
rights and privileges under this Section 1.6. Each Stockholder severally (and
not jointly) hereby agrees to reimburse Parent and Purchaser for any fees and
expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees) incurred by Parent and Purchaser
in connection with any successful litigation, dispute or other attempt to
recover the portion of the Excess Amount due from such Stockholder pursuant to
this Section 1.6 in the event that Stockholder fails to deliver such Excess
Amount to Parent upon written demand.

         1.7 Transfer of Company Options and Company Warrants. Each Stockholder
holding Company Options or Company Warrants severally (and not jointly) agrees
that so long as this Agreement shall remain in effect, such Stockholder (for
purposes of this Section 1.7, an "OPTIONHOLDER") will not transfer or exercise
any Company Options or Company Warrants held by such Optionholder except to an
Affiliate of such Stockholder that becomes a party to this Agreement or a
similar agreement; provided, however, that each Optionholder agrees to accept at
the Effective Time (as defined in the Merger Agreement) an amount in respect of
such Company Options equal to the Company Option Payments and an amount in
respect of such Company Warrants equal to the Company Warrant Payments, and each
such Company Option and Company Warrant shall thereafter be canceled. Nothing in
this Agreement shall limit the ability of the holders of Company Options or
Company Warrants to exercise such securities in accordance with their terms,
provided that such holder tenders the shares of Company Common Stock issued upon
exercise thereof in the Offer.

         SECTION 2. Effectiveness; Termination. This Agreement shall become
effective as to each Stockholder upon its execution by such Stockholder, Parent
and Purchaser and upon the execution of the Merger Agreement. This Agreement may
be terminated as to each Stockholder at any time by mutual written consent of
such Stockholder, Parent and Purchaser. Other than the provisions of Section 1.6
and Section 6, this Agreement shall terminate, without any action by the parties
hereto, on the date on which the Merger Agreement terminates in accordance with
its terms.

         SECTION 3. Representations and Warranties.

         3.1 Representations and Warranties of Stockholders. Each Stockholder
hereby represents and warrants, severally (and not jointly), to Parent and
Purchaser as follows:

               (a) Title. Such Stockholder has good and valid title to the Owned
Shares of such Stockholder, free and clear of any lien, pledge, charge,
encumbrance or claim of whatever nature and, upon the purchase of the Tender
Shares by Purchaser, such Stockholder will deliver good and valid title to the
Tender Shares, free and clear of any lien, charge, encumbrance or claim of
whatever nature.

               (b) No Other Rights. Except for this Agreement and as shown on
Schedule I hereto, there are no outstanding options, warrants or rights to
purchase or acquire the Shares of such Stockholder.

               (c) Ownership of Shares. On the date hereof, the Owned Shares of
such Stockholder are owned of record or beneficially by such Stockholder and, on
the date hereof, such Owned Shares of such Stockholder constitute all of the
Shares owned of record or beneficially by such Stockholder. Such Stockholder has
sole power of disposition with respect to all of the Owned Shares of such
Stockholder, with no restrictions, subject to applicable federal securities
laws, on such Stockholder's rights of disposition pertaining thereto.

               (d) Power; Binding Agreement. Such Stockholder has the legal
capacity, and all the necessary power and authority to enter into and perform
all of its obligations under this Agreement. The execution, delivery and
performance of this Agreement by such Stockholder will not violate any other
agreement to which such Stockholder is a party including, without limitation,
any voting agreement, stockholders agreement or voting trust. This Agreement has
been duly and validly executed and delivered by such Stockholder, and assuming
this Agreement has been duly and validly authorized, executed and delivered by
each party hereto other than such Stockholder, this Agreement constitutes a
valid and binding agreement of such Stockholder, enforceable against such
Stockholder in accordance with its terms, except that (i) such enforcement may
be subject to applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium, or
similar laws, now or hereafter in effect, affecting creditor rights generally
and (ii) the remedy of specific performance and injunctive and other equitable
relief may be subject to equitable defenses and to the discretion of the court.

               (e) No Conflicts. Other than in connection with or in compliance
with the provisions of the Exchange Act, no authorization, consent or approval
of, or filing with, any court or any public body or authority is necessary for
the consummation by such Stockholder of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. The execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement and the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby will not constitute a
breach, violation or default (or any event which, with notice or lapse of time
or both, would constitute a default) under, or result in the termination of, or
accelerate the performance required by, or result in a right of termination or
acceleration under, or result in the creation of any lien, encumbrance, pledge,
charge or claim upon any of the properties or assets of such Stockholder under,
(i) the certificate of incorporation or other organizational documents of such
Stockholder, if any, or (ii) any note, bond, mortgage, indenture, deed of trust,
license, lease, agreement or other instrument to which such Stockholder is a
party or by which its properties or assets are bound.

               (f) No Finder's Fees. No broker, investment banker, financial
advisor or other Person is entitled to any broker's, finder's, financial
adviser's or other similar fee or commission in connection with the transactions
contemplated hereby based upon arrangements made by or on behalf of such
Stockholder.

         3.2 Representations and Warranties of Parent and Purchaser. Each of
Parent and Purchaser hereby represent and warrant to each Stockholder that the
Offer, the Offer Documents and the transactions contemplated thereby will comply
in all material respects with the provisions of applicable federal securities
laws. Parent and Purchaser further represent that the Offer Documents, on the
date filed with the SEC and on the date first published, sent or given to the
Stockholders, will not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit
to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order
to make the statements made

therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not
misleading, except that no representation is made by Parent or Purchaser with
respect to information supplied by the Company for inclusion in the Offer
Documents. Each of Parent and Purchaser agree and acknowledge that the
Stockholders are entering into this Agreement in material reliance on this
Section 3.2.

         SECTION 4. Additional Shares. Each Stockholder hereby agrees, while
this Agreement is in effect, to promptly notify Parent of the number of any new
Shares acquired by such Stockholder, if any, after the date hereof.

         SECTION 5. Further Assurances. From time to time, at the Parent's
request and without further consideration, each Stockholder shall execute and
deliver such additional documents and take all such further action as may be
reasonably necessary or desirable to carry out the provisions of this Agreement.

         SECTION 6. Miscellaneous.

         6.1 Non-Survival. The representations and warranties made by a
Stockholder herein shall terminate upon the termination of this Agreement, other
than such Stockholder's representations and warranties in Sections 3(a) through
(c) which shall survive the termination of this Agreement.

         6.2 Entire Agreement; Assignment. This Agreement (i) constitutes the
entire agreement between the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof
and supersedes all other prior agreements and understandings, both written and
oral, between the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and (ii)
shall not be assigned by operation of law or otherwise, provided that Parent may
assign its rights and obligations hereunder to any direct or indirect wholly
owned subsidiary of Parent, but no such assignment shall relieve Parent of its
obligations hereunder if such assignee does not perform such obligations.

         6.3 Waiver and Amendments. Any provision of this Agreement may be
waived at any time by the party which is entitled to the benefits thereof and
this Agreement may be amended or supplemented at any time. No such waiver,
amendment or supplement shall be effective unless in writing and signed by the
party sought to be bound thereby.

receipt requested, postage prepaid, in each case addressed as above (or to such
other address as such party may designate in writing from time to time).

         6.5 Governing Law; Jurisdiction. This Agreement shall be governed by
and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Texas, regardless of
the laws that might otherwise govern under applicable principles of conflicts of
laws thereof; provided, however, that the laws of the State of Nevada will
govern the internal affairs of the Company. Each Stockholder, Parent and
Purchaser irrevocably submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of any Texas state
or federal court sitting in the State of Texas in any action arising out of or
relating to this Agreement, hereby irrevocably agrees that all claims in respect
of such action may be heard and determined in such Texas state or federal court,
and hereby irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent it may effectively do so,
the defense of an inconvenient forum to the maintenance of such action or
proceeding.

         6.6 Specific Performance. Each Stockholder recognizes and acknowledges
that a breach by it of any covenants or agreements contained in this Agreement
will cause Parent to sustain damages for which it would not have an adequate
remedy at law, and therefore each Stockholder agrees that in the event of any
such breach Parent shall be entitled to the remedy of specific performance of
such covenants and agreements and injunctive and other equitable relief in
addition to any other remedy to which it may be entitled, at law or in equity.

         6.7 Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in counterparts, each
of which shall be deemed to be an original, but all of which shall constitute
one and the same Agreement. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, regardless of the number of Stockholders that enter into this
Agreement, all obligations, duties and liabilities of the Stockholders hereunder
shall be several and not joint.

         6.8 Descriptive Headings. The descriptive headings used herein are
inserted for convenience of reference only and are not intended to be part of or
to affect the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement.

         6.9 Severability. Whenever possible, each provision or portion of any
provision of this Agreement will be interpreted in such manner as to be
effective and valid under applicable law but if any provision or portion of any
provision of this Agreement is held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable in
any respect under any applicable law or rule in any jurisdiction, such
invalidity, illegality or unenforceability will not affect any other provision
or portion of any provision in such jurisdiction, and this Agreement will be
reformed, construed and enforced in such jurisdiction as if such invalid,
illegal or unenforceable provision or portion of any provision had never been
contained herein.

         6.10 Expenses. Each of the parties shall pay its own expenses in
connection with the negotiation, execution and performance of this Agreement.

CONFIDENTIALITY AGREEMENT, DATED 10/30/00

                                                                  EXHIBIT (d)(4)

[TEXOIL LOGO]

October 30, 2000

Mr. Hank Wood
Ocean Energy, Inc.
1001 Fannin
Suite 1600
Houston TX, 77002-6794

Subject: Confidentiality Agreement

Dear Mr. Wood:

In connection with a possible transaction between Texoil, Inc. ("Texoil") and
Ocean Energy, Inc. ("Ocean"), Texoil intends to furnish Ocean with certain oral
and written information about Texoil that is non-public, confidential and/or
proprietary in nature, including, but not limited to certain financial and
contractual information, certain information related to proved reserves
("Reserve Reports") and certain information related to unproved prospects
("Prospects"). All such information provided pursuant to this letter agreement
(the "Confidentiality Agreement") about Texoil is to be considered confidential.
Collectively all such information is referred to herein as the "Evaluation
Material" and collectively Texoil and Ocean may be referred to herein as the
"Parties". It is agreed that for purposes of this Confidentiality Agreement, the
Evaluation Material does not include information which (i) was or becomes
available to the public other than as a result of actions taken by Ocean or
Ocean's subsidiaries or affiliates or their respective directors, officers,
employees, affiliates or agents (collectively "Representatives") in violation of
this Agreement, (ii) was in the possession of Ocean prior to disclosure by or on
behalf of Texoil, (iii) becomes available to Ocean, without obligation of
confidentiality from a source other than Texoil or Agents, provided that such
source is not bound by a confidentiality agreement with Texoil or (iv) is
required to be disclosed by law, rule, regulation or by legal process.

For a period ending one year from the date hereof the Evaluation Material may be
used by Ocean or its Representatives, solely for the purpose of evaluating a
possible business transaction or combination with Texoil (a "Transaction") and
the Evaluation Material will be kept confidential by Ocean and its
Representatives; provided, however, that any of the Evaluation Material may be
disclosed to Representatives who need to review such possible Transaction and
who are bound to comply with the obligation of confidentiality hereunder. It is
specifically understood that such Representatives shall be informed of the
confidential nature of such Evaluation Material, shall be directed to treat such
Evaluation Material confidentially, and shall be bound by the terms of this
Confidentiality Agreement.

Each Party agrees that it will not, nor will its Representatives, without the
prior written consent of the other Party, except as required by law, disclose to
any person either the fact that any investigations, discussions or negotiations
are taking place concerning a possible Transaction or any of the terms,
conditions or other facts with respect to any such possible Transaction,

Confidentiality Agreement
Page 2

including the status thereof. The term "person" as used in this letter shall be
broadly interpreted to include, without limitation, any corporation, company,
partnership or individual.

In the event that no Transaction is effected between the Parties within a
reasonable time after the Evaluation Material has been furnished to Ocean and
upon the written request of Texoil, Ocean and its Representatives will deliver
to Texoil, within five (5) business days, the Evaluation Material along with
any and all copies, notes, extracts thereof, and also upon written request of
Texoil deliver an authorized statement, in writing, that all analyses,
projections, and other work product derived from or directly relating to the
Evaluation Material have been returned to Texoil or destroyed.

In the event that Ocean or anyone to whom it supplies Evaluation Material
receives a request to disclose any or all of the Evaluation Material under the
requirements of applicable law, including without limitation, the rules of the
Securities and Exchange Commission, state securities commissions or agencies or
securities exchange, or under the terms of a subpoena, Ocean agrees to (i)
immediately notify Texoil of the existence, terms and circumstances surrounding
such request, (ii) consult with Texoil on the advisability of taking legally
available steps to resist or narrow such request, and (iii) if disclosure is
required, furnish only that portion of the information which, in the written
opinion of counsel, Ocean is legally compelled to disclose.

Texoil will endeavor to include in the Evaluation Material, known information,
which it believes to be relevant for the purpose of an evaluation. Ocean
understands that Texoil, its affiliates and agents make no representation or
warranty as to the accuracy or completeness of the Evaluation Material,
including the accuracy of any reserve estimates, the Reserve Reports or any
other estimates relating to the assets and/or liabilities of Texoil.

It is understood and agreed that money damages would not be sufficient remedy
for any breach of this Confidentiality Agreement by Ocean and that Texoil shall
be entitled to specific performance as a remedy for any such breach. It is
accordingly agreed that Texoil shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions
to limit or prevent breaches of this agreement and/or compel specific
performance of this agreement and that neither Ocean nor its counsel or
Representatives will oppose the granting of such relief. Such remedy shall not
be deemed to be the exclusive remedy for the breach of this Confidentiality
Agreement but shall be in addition to all other remedies available at law or

This Confidentiality Agreement shall be governed by the laws of the State of
Texas without regard to conflict of law principles, and Ocean and its

In the event that Ocean makes any offer for Texoil common stock and/or
securities convertible into Texoil common stock, which includes Ocean securities
of any form, and to the extent that Texoil requires material non-public
information related to Ocean to evaluate such offer, then Texoil will agree to
enter into a separate confidentiality agreement, mutually agreeable to the
Parties, applicable to any such information provided by Ocean.

Texoil warrants that it has the right to allow Ocean access to the Evaluation
Material. Texoil agrees to release, defend, indemnify, protect and hold Ocean,
its subsidiaries and affiliates and their respective directors, officers,
employees, consultants, representatives, agents and advisors harmless from and

deemed to exist between the Parties, and neither Party will be under any legal

Texoil, Inc.

Subject: Confidentiality Agreement

Dear Mr. Lodzinski:

In connection with a possible transaction between Texoil, Inc., a Nevada
corporation (the "Company") and Ocean Energy, Inc., a Texas corporation (the
"Purchaser"), the Purchaser intends to furnish the Company with certain oral
and written information about the Purchaser that is non-public, confidential
and/or proprietary in nature, including, but not limited to certain financial
and contractual information, certain information related to proved reserves
("Reserve Reports") and certain information related to unproved prospects
("Prospects"). All such information provided pursuant to this letter agreement
(the "Confidentiality Agreement") about the Purchaser is to be considered
confidential. Collectively all such information is referred to herein as the
"Evaluation Material" and collectively the Purchaser and the Company may be
referred to herein as the "Parties." It is agreed that for purposes of this
Confidentiality Agreement, the Evaluation Material does not include information
which (i) was or becomes available to the public other than as a result of
actions taken by the Company or the Company's subsidiaries or affiliates or
their respective directors, officers, employees, affiliates or agents
(collectively "Representatives") in violation of this Agreement, (ii) was in
the possession of the Company prior to disclosure by or on behalf of the
Purchaser, or (iii) becomes available to the Company, without obligation of
confidentiality from a source other than the Purchaser or its Representatives,
provided that such source is not bound by a confidentiality agreement with the
Purchaser.

For a period ending one year from the date hereof, the Evaluation Material may
be used by the Company or its Representatives, solely for the purpose of
evaluating a possible business transaction or combination with the Purchaser (a
"Transaction"), and the Evaluation Material will be kept confidential by the
Company and its Representatives; provided, however, that any of the Evaluation
Material may be disclosed to Representatives who need to review such possible
Transaction and who are bound to comply with the obligation of confidentiality
hereunder. It is specifically understood that such Representatives shall be
informed of the confidential nature of such Evaluation Material, shall be
directed to treat such Evaluation Material confidentially, and shall be bound
by the terms of this Confidentiality Agreement.

Each Party agrees that it will not, nor will its Representatives, without the
prior written consent of the other Party, except as required by law, disclose to
any person either the fact that any investigations, discussions or negotiations
are taking place concerning a possible Transaction or any of the terms,
conditions or other facts with respect to any such possible Transaction,
including the status thereof. The term "person" as used in this letter shall be
broadly interpreted to include, without limitation, any corporation, company,
partnership or individual.

In the event that no Transaction is effected between the Parties within a
reasonable time after the Evaluation Material has been furnished to the Company
and upon the written request of the Purchaser, the Company and its
Representatives will deliver to the Purchaser, within five (5) business days of
receipt of such request, the Evaluation Material along with any and all copies,
notes, electronic or otherwise, and extracts thereof, and also upon written
request of the Purchaser deliver an authorized statement, in writing, that all
analyses, projections, and other work product derived from or directly relating
to the Evaluation Material have been returned to the Purchaser or destroyed.

In the event that the Company or anyone to whom it supplies Evaluation Material
receives a request to disclose any or all of the Evaluation Material under the
requirements of applicable law, including without limitation, the rules of the
Securities and Exchange Commission, state securities commissions or agencies or
securities exchange, or under the terms of a subpoena, agrees to (i)
immediately notify the Purchaser of the existence, terms, circumstances
surrounding such request, (ii) consult with the Purchaser on the advisability
of taking legally available steps to resist or narrow such request, and (iii)
if disclosure is required, furnish only that portion of the information which,
in the written opinion of counsel, the Company is legally compelled to disclose.

The Purchaser will endeavor to include in the Evaluation Material, known
information, which it believes to be relevant for the purpose of an evaluation.
The Company understands that the Purchaser and its Representatives make no
representation or warranty as to the accuracy or completeness of the Evaluation
Material, including the accuracy of any reserve estimates, the Reserve Reports
or any other estimates relating to the assets and/or liabilities of the
Purchaser.

It is understood and agreed that money damages would not be a sufficient remedy
for any breach of this Confidentiality Agreement by the Company and that the
Purchaser, shall be entitled to specific performance as a remedy in connection
with any actual or threatened breach. It is accordingly agreed that the
Purchaser shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to limit or prevent
actual or threatened breaches of this agreement and/or compel specific
performance of this agreement and that neither the Company nor its counsel or
Representatives will oppose the granting of such relief. Such remedy shall not
be deemed to be the exclusive remedy for the actual or threatened breach of
this Confidentiality Agreement but shall be in addition all other remedies
available at law or equity.

It is further understood and agreed that no failure or delay by the Purchaser
in exercising any right, power or privilege hereunder shall operate as a waiver
thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise thereof preclude any other or
further exercise thereof or the exercise of any right, power or privilege
hereunder.

In addition, the Company agrees that neither it nor its Representatives will
use any non-public information obtained (directly or indirectly) from or about
the Purchaser to trade in the Purchaser's securities, nor will the Company or
its Representatives divulge any non-public information obtained (directly or
indirectly) from or about the Purchaser to any other party, which could be used
by such other party to trade in the Purchaser's securities.

This Confidentiality Agreement shall be governed by the laws of the State of
Texas without regard to conflict of law principles, and the Company and its
Representatives submit to the nonexclusive jurisdiction of and venue in any
federal or state court sitting in Texas in any action or proceedings arising
out of or relating to this Confidentiality Agreement.

The Purchaser warrants that it has the right to allow the Company access to the
Evaluation Material. The Purchaser agrees to release, defend, indemnify,
protect and hold the Company, its subsidiaries and affiliates and their
respective directors, officers, employees, consultants, representatives, agents
and advisors harmless from and against any and all claims, liabilities, losses,
demands, causes of action and any expenses (including court costs and
attorney's fees) arising from any breach or alleged breach by the Purchaser of
license agreements or other agreements under which the Evaluation Material was
obtained.

This Agreement does not create any agency, partnership or joint venture
relationship between the Parties. The Parties hereto understand and agree that
unless and until a definitive agreement has been executed and delivered, no
contract or agreement providing for a transaction between the Parties shall be
deemed to exist between the Parties, and neither Party will be under any legal
obligation of any kind whatsoever with respect to such transaction by virtue of
this or any written or oral expression thereof, except, in case of this
agreement matters specially agreed to herein. For purposes of this Agreement,
the term "definitive agreement" does not include an executed letter of intent
or any other preliminary written agreement or offer, unless specifically so
designated in writing and executed by both Parties.
