SUBJECT TO COMPLETION DATED SEPTEMBER 14, 2001

PROXY STATEMENT/PROSPECTUS 

The Proposed divine/RoweCom Merger  

    divine, inc. and RoweCom Inc. have agreed on a transaction whereby divine will acquire RoweCom in a stock-for-stock
transaction. The transaction is structured as a merger in which a newly-formed, wholly-owned subsidiary of divine will be merged into RoweCom. If we complete the merger, RoweCom stockholders will
receive 0.75 of a share of divine class A common stock for each share of RoweCom common stock that they own. 

    divine's class A common stock is traded on the Nasdaq National Market under the symbol "DVIN." On September 10, 2001, the closing sale price of divine's class A
common stock was $0.82.

    We cannot complete the merger unless the RoweCom stockholders approve and adopt the merger agreement and the merger. A special meeting has therefore been scheduled for RoweCom
stockholders to vote on the merger. This proxy statement/prospectus provides you with detailed information about the proposed merger and the special meeting. 
Please read this
entire document

carefully, including the "Risk Factors" section beginning on page 25
, 
which discusses the potential risks involved in the merger, in the operation of
the combined company and in owning divine class A common stock.

    Your vote is very important, regardless of the number of shares you own. Whether or not you plan to attend the meeting, please take the time to vote
(1) by completing and mailing the enclosed proxy card to us, (2) by telephone or (3) over the Internet. If you sign, date and mail your proxy card without indicating how you want
to vote, we will count your proxy as a vote in favor of approving and adopting the merger agreement, the merger and any other proposal properly submitted to stockholders at the meeting. If you
abstain, do not vote or do not instruct your broker how to vote any shares your broker holds for you in its name, the effect will be a vote against approval and adoption of the merger agreement and
the merger. Returning your proxy card or voting by telephone or over the Internet will not affect your right to vote in person if you choose to attend the special meeting. 

    The
date, time and place of the special meeting is as follows: 

October  , 2001

10:00 a.m. Eastern time

RoweCom Inc.

15 Southwest Park

Westwood, Massachusetts 02090

The board of directors of RoweCom has unanimously approved the merger agreement and the merger and recommends that you vote FOR the
proposal to approve and adopt the merger agreement and the merger.  

    This proxy statement/prospectus serves as (1) RoweCom's proxy statement in connection with the solicitation of proxies by the RoweCom board of directors
for use at the special meeting and (2) divine's prospectus in connection with its issuance of its class A common stock in the merger. 

Dr. Richard R. Rowe

Chairman and Chief Executive Officer

RoweCom Inc.

Neither the Securities and Exchange Commission nor any state securities commission has approved or disapproved of the merger or the divine class A
common stock to be issued in the merger or determined if this proxy statement/prospectus is accurate or complete. Any representation to the contrary is a criminal offense.  

    This proxy statement/prospectus is dated             , 2001 and was first mailed to RoweCom stockholders on or
about             , 2001.

NOTICE OF SPECIAL MEETING OF STOCKHOLDERS

TO BE HELD ON OCTOBER  , 2001

To our stockholders: 

    We will hold a special meeting of stockholders of RoweCom Inc. at 10:00 a.m., local time, on October   , 2001 at our corporate offices located at 15
Southwest Park, Westwood, Massachusetts. At the RoweCom special meeting, we will ask you to vote on:


a
proposal to approve and adopt the agreement and plan of merger and reorganization, dated as of July 6, 2001, by and among divine, inc.,
Knowledge Resources Acquisition Corp., a wholly-owned subsidiary of divine, and RoweCom Inc., and the merger of Knowledge Resources Acquisition Corp. into RoweCom; and


such
other business as may properly come before the special meeting or any adjournment or postponement of the special meeting. 

    We have fixed the close of business on September 4, 2001 as the record date for determining which of our stockholders are entitled to notice of, and to vote at, the special
meeting or any

adjournment or postponement of the special meeting. Approval of the merger proposal requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the RoweCom common stock outstanding as of the record date.

After careful consideration, your board of directors unanimously recommends that you vote FOR approval and adoption of the merger agreement and the merger.  

Please complete, sign and promptly return the proxy card in the enclosed prepaid envelope or vote by telephone or over the Internet in
accordance with the instructions provided, whether or not you expect to attend the special meeting
. You can revoke your proxy at any time before it has been voted at the
special meeting. Returning your proxy card or voting by telephone or over the Internet will not affect your right to vote in person if you choose to attend the special meeting. If you fail to vote by
proxy card, telephone, over the Internet or at the special meeting, or fail to instruct your broker how to vote any shares your broker holds for you in its name, or if you abstain, it will have the
same effect as voting against the approval and adoption of the merger agreement and the merger. You can revoke your proxy in the manner described in this proxy statement/prospectus at any time before
it has been voted at the special meeting. 

You should not send RoweCom stock certificates with your proxy card. After we complete the merger, the exchange agent will send you written instructions for
exchanging RoweCom stock certificates for divine stock certificates.  

By order of the board of directors,

QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS ABOUT
  THE PROPOSED DIVINE/ROWECOM MERGER    

Q:
Why are the two companies proposing to merge?

A:
The
products and services offered by the companies are generally complementary, and we expect that the acquisition of RoweCom will provide our combined enterprise significant
potential advantages and resources, including a more diversified portfolio of products and services. We believe that the proposed merger will allow us to accelerate long-term growth and
provide added stockholder value. Achieving these anticipated benefits, however, is subject to certain risks discussed in "Risk Factors" beginning on page 25. To review the reasons for the
acquisition in greater detail, see "The MergerReasons for the Merger" beginning on page 52.

Q:
How will I benefit?

A:
We
believe that you will benefit by being an owner of a company that is able to compete more effectively than either divine or RoweCom individually.

Q:
What will happen in the merger?

A:
A
newly-formed, wholly-owned subsidiary of divine will merge into RoweCom. As a result, RoweCom will survive as a wholly-owned subsidiary of divine.

Q:
What will I receive in the merger?

A:
If
we complete the merger, you will receive 0.75 of a share of divine class A common stock in exchange for each share of RoweCom common stock that you own. In this proxy
statement/prospectus, all references to divine common stock are to divine class A common stock along with the right to purchase divine's series A junior participating preferred stock
under divine's stockholders' rights plan. There are currently no other classes of divine common stock outstanding. 

Example: If you own 1,000 shares of RoweCom common stock at the time we complete the merger, you will be entitled to receive 750 shares of divine common
stock.

Q:
What happens as the market price of divine common stock fluctuates?

A:
The
exchange ratio, and therefore the number of shares of divine common stock that you will receive in the merger, is fixed and will not be adjusted in the event of any increase or
decrease in the price of divine common stock. Therefore, the value of the divine common stock you will receive in the merger will fluctuate as the price of divine common stock increases or decreases.
You should obtain a current market quotation for divine common stock before voting on the merger.

Q:
Will divine issue fractional shares?

A:
divine
will not issue fractional shares. Instead, you will receive a cash payment for any fractional share based on the closing sale price of a share of divine common stock on the
trading day immediately prior to the merger. 

Q:
What do I need to do now?

A:
After
carefully reviewing and considering this proxy statement/prospectus, you should submit your proxy by mail, by telephone or over the Internet before the special meeting so that
your shares are represented at the special meeting. You may also attend the special meeting scheduled to take place on October   2001. The board of directors of RoweCom
unanimously recommends voting in favor of the approval and adoption of the merger agreement and the merger.

Q:
What stockholder vote is required to approve the merger?

A:
The
affirmative vote of a majority of the shares of RoweCom common stock outstanding as of the record date, September 4, 2001, is required to approve and adopt the merger
agreement and the merger.

Q:
How can I vote my shares without attending the special meeting?

A:
You
may vote your shares without attending the special meeting by granting a proxy to us. You can do this:


by
mailif you vote by mail, complete, sign and date your enclosed proxy card and mail it using the enclosed postage paid envelope; or


by
telephone or Internetif you vote by telephone or over the Internet, you will be required to have the control number appearing on your proxy
card available to submit your vote. A properly completed telephone or Internet vote has the same effect as if you marked, signed and returned the proxy card by mail. See the instructions on the proxy
card for a detailed description of telephone and Internet voting procedures.

Q:
If my RoweCom shares are held in "street name" by my broker, will my broker vote my shares for me?

A:
Your
broker will only vote your shares if you provide instructions on how to vote. You should follow the directions provided by your broker regarding how to instruct your broker to
vote your shares. If you do not provide instructions to your broker on how to vote your
shares, they will not be voted. This will have the same effect as voting against the adoption and approval of the merger agreement and the merger.

Q:
What if I don't vote by proxy or at the special meeting or I abstain?

A:
If
you fail to vote by proxy or at the special meeting or abstain from voting, it will have the same effect as a vote against the adoption and approval of the merger agreement and
the merger.

Q:
Can I change my vote after I have mailed a signed proxy card or voted by telephone or over the Internet?

A:
If
you are a stockholder of record, you may revoke a previously-granted proxy and change your vote at any time before your proxy is voted at the special meeting in one of the
following ways:


by
delivering a written notice to RoweCom's Investor Relations office that states you would like to revoke your proxy; 


by
delivering a later-dated proxy card by mail;


by
telephone or over the Internet as set forth in the instructions provided along with your proxy card; or


by
attending the special meeting and voting in person (merely attending the meeting will not revoke your previously-granted proxy and change your vote; you
must cast a vote at the special meeting). 

For
shares held in the name of a bank, broker or other fiduciary, you may change your vote by submitting new voting instructions to the bank, broker or other fiduciary. 

Q:
What if I receive more than one proxy card?

A:
It
may mean that your shares are registered in different ways or are in more than one account. Please provide voting instructions for all proxy cards you receive to ensure that all
of your shares are voted at the meeting.

Q:
Should I send in my RoweCom stock certificate now?

A:
No.
After we complete the merger, Computershare Investor Services, LLC, the exchange agent, will send you written instructions for exchanging your RoweCom stock certificates for
divine stock certificates.

Q:
When do you expect to complete the merger?

A:
We
are working toward completing the merger as quickly as possible after the special meeting. However, in addition to obtaining stockholder approval, RoweCom must also satisfy other
conditions, including financing conditions, before we can complete the merger. Therefore, we cannot predict exactly when we will complete the merger.

Q:
What are the tax consequences of the merger?

A:
You
generally will not recognize gain or loss for U.S. federal income tax purposes on the exchange of RoweCom common stock for divine common stock, except for taxes on cash you
receive for a fractional share. To review the tax consequences to RoweCom stockholders in greater detail, see "The MergerMaterial United States Federal Income Tax Consequences" beginning
on page 65. The tax consequences to each of you will depend on your particular situation. You should therefore consult your own tax advisor for an understanding of the tax consequences to you
resulting from the merger.

Q:
What will happen to RoweCom if we do not complete the merger?

A:
If
we do not complete the merger for any reason, RoweCom's current cash and existing credit facilities would not be sufficient beyond December 2001, and RoweCom does not
believe it could secure all required working capital lines of credit in time to fund the fourth quarter ordering season. Therefore, RoweCom's management would consider, among other actions,
negotiating extended payment terms on existing debt and other liabilities, seeking another purchaser and/or filing for bankruptcy protection. RoweCom may also be subject to a number of other material
risks if we do not complete the merger. For example, under the terms of the merger agreement, RoweCom may be required under certain circumstances to pay divine a termination fee. In addition, 

significant
merger-related costs incurred by RoweCom, such as legal, accounting and financial advisor fees, must be paid by RoweCom if we do not complete the merger. Also, the price of RoweCom common
stock may decline to the extent that its current market price reflects a market assumption that we will complete the merger. RoweCom is not currently in compliance with the Nasdaq National Market's
listing maintenance requirements and was notified that its common stock will be delisted if we do not complete the merger by November 5, 2001.

Q:
Who can I call with questions?

A:
If
you would like additional copies of this proxy statement/prospectus or the enclosed proxy card, or, if you have questions about the merger, the special meeting, or how to vote by
proxy, you should contact one of the following:

conducted no business since its incorporation other than executing the merger agreement. 

Our Reasons for the Merger

address strategic opportunities more effectively.

RoweCom board unanimously recommends that you vote 
FOR
 the proposal to approve and adopt the merger agreement and the merger.

there were 12,952,745 shares of RoweCom's common stock outstanding and entitled to vote at the RoweCom special meeting, approximately 15% of which were held by directors and executive
officers of RoweCom and their affiliates. These directors and executive officers have indicated their intention to vote, or cause to be voted, the shares beneficially owned by them in favor of the
approval and adoption of the merger agreement and the merger.

The Merger  

    The merger agreement is attached as Appendix A to this proxy statement/prospectus. We encourage you to read the merger agreement because it is the legal
document that governs the merger. If the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of RoweCom common stock approve and adopt the merger agreement and the merger and all other conditions to the
merger are satisfied or waived, Knowledge Resources Acquisition Corp. will merge into RoweCom. As a result, RoweCom will survive as a wholly-owned subsidiary of divine. 

 What You Will Receive 
(pages 63 and 68)

    If
we complete the merger, each outstanding share of RoweCom common stock will be exchanged for 0.75 of a share of divine common stock, subject to the payment of cash for fractional
shares. The value of the divine shares you will receive in the merger will fluctuate

as the market price of divine common stock changes. As of September 10, 2001, divine had 164,124,076 shares of common stock issued and outstanding. Based upon 13,552,745 shares of
RoweCom common stock issued and outstanding as of September 10, 2001 and the 0.75 exchange ratio, divine will issue an aggregate of approximately 10,164,558 shares of divine common stock to
holders of RoweCom common stock following the merger. Assuming that divine (1) completes its pending mergers with eshare communications, Inc. and Open Market, Inc. (which are
discussed under "divine's Recent Developments"), (2) issues approximately 64,377,716 shares of divine common stock pursuant to the eshare merger (based upon
21,934,486 eshare common shares issued and outstanding and an eshare exchange ratio of 2.935 as of September 10, 2001), (3) issues 44,454,961 shares of divine common stock
pursuant to the Open Market merger and (4) does not issue any other shares of divine common stock prior to the closing of this merger, the existing holders of these shares of RoweCom common
stock collectively will hold approximately 3.6% of divine common stock issued and outstanding after the merger.

 Treatment of Outstanding Options
 (page 68)

    Each
outstanding option to purchase RoweCom common stock under RoweCom's stock incentive plans, other than options granted under RoweCom's 1999 Non-Employee Director Plan,
that has an exercise price that is less than or equal to the product obtained from multiplying (1) the closing price for a divine share as reported on the Nasdaq National Market on the trading
day immediately before the consummation of the merger by (2) the exchange ratio of 0.75, and is therefore "in-the-money," will convert into a fully exercisable option to
purchase, at an exercise price equal to the current exercise price of the option divided by 0.75, a number of shares of divine common stock equal to the number of RoweCom shares subject to the option
multiplied by 0.75. divine will issue these options under its 1999 or 2001 Stock Incentive Plan, as determined by divine before completion of the merger. Upon completion of the merger, RoweCom will
send a notice to holders of all other options granted by RoweCom under its 1998 Amended and Restated Stock Incentive Plan informing them that their options will be cancelled if not exercised within
ten days after completion of the merger. RoweCom has agreed to use its commercially reasonable efforts to enter into agreements for the termination of all other "out-of-the
money" options and all options granted under its 1999 Non-Employee Director Plan. The approval of the mailing of the notice to optionholders by RoweCom's compensation committee and the
termination of these other options are conditions to closing the merger. 

 Treatment of Outstanding Warrants
 (page 69)

    Subject
to the discussion under "Treatment of Outstanding Bridge Notes," each outstanding warrant to purchase RoweCom common stock will convert into a warrant to purchase
shares of divine common stock. Except for the converted warrants to be held by HFTP Investment L.L.C. and Leonardo, L.P., (1) the exercise price of each converted warrant will be the exercise
price of the original RoweCom warrant immediately prior to consummation of the merger divided by 0.75 and (2) exercise of the converted warrant will entitle the holder to the number of shares
of divine common stock equal to the number of RoweCom shares subject to the original RoweCom warrant multiplied by 0.75. divine and HFTP Investment and Leonardo are negotiating the exercise price and
number of shares of divine common stock that will be issuable upon exercise of the converted warrants to be held by HFTP Investment and Leonardo upon consummation of the merger. divine has agreed to
file with the SEC promptly after the completion of the merger a registration statement registering the public resale of the shares of divine common stock issuable upon exercise of all the converted
warrants.

 Treatment of Outstanding Bridge Notes
 (page 69)

    Pursuant
to the terms of RoweCom's $6,135,000 in outstanding aggregate principal amount of promissory notes dated May 26, 2000, the holders of these bridge notes have demanded
repayment of the bridge notes upon consummation of the merger. divine expects to repay approximately $475,000 in aggregate principal amount of these bridge notes upon consummation of the merger. As a
condition to completing the merger, the holders of the remaining $5,660,000 in aggregate principal amount of these bridge notes must agree to exchange these bridge notes for an equal principal amount
of notes that will be convertible into divine common stock at any time after 30 days after completion of the merger and before repayment of the convertible notes. divine and the holders of
these bridge notes are negotiating the terms of the convertible notes, including their interest rate, maturity date, conversion price and security. In addition, all of the noteholders must agree to
exchange outstanding warrants issued to them in connection with the bridge notes for warrants to purchase shares of divine common stock upon completion of the merger. divine expects that the number of
divine shares underlying the exchanged warrants and the exercise price will be adjusted by the 0.75 exchange ratio as described under "Treatment of Outstanding Warrants." The noteholders,
however, have requested that (1) the exercise price of the exchanged warrants be decreased so that it is tied to the market price of divine common stock and (2) they be issued additional divine
warrants. divine has agreed to file with the SEC within 60 days after completion of the merger a registration statement registering the public resale of the shares of divine common stock
issuable upon conversion of the convertible notes and exercise of the related warrants.

 Treatment of Outstanding Senior Secured Notes 
(page 64)

    In
January 2001, RoweCom issued $9,000,000 in aggregate principal amount of floating rate senior secured notes to several suppliers. The notes are due on December 28, 2001, and
interest is payable upon maturity of the notes at a rate of prime plus 1%. RoweCom is currently in violation of several covenants in these notes. Accordingly, these notes are due on demand, if so
called by the suppliers that hold them. divine and the suppliers that hold these notes are negotiating the waiver of these defaults, the exchange of these notes upon

consummation of the merger for notes that are convertible into divine common stock and the terms and conditions of the convertible notes.

 Opinion of RoweCom's Financial Advisor 
(page 55)

    Chatsworth
Securities LLC delivered its oral opinion to the RoweCom board on June 6, 2001 that, as of May 24, 2001, which was the date that the letter of intent entered
into between divine and RoweCom regarding the proposed terms of the merger was publicly announced, the consideration to be received by the RoweCom stockholders was fair, from a financial point of
view, to the RoweCom stockholders. Chatsworth also delivered to the RoweCom board on July 6, 2001 its written opinion dated July 6, 2001 that, as of July 6, 2001 and subject to
the assumptions, qualifications and limitations set forth in the written opinion, the consideration was fair, from a financial point of view, to the RoweCom stockholders. The full text of the written
opinion is attached to this proxy statement/prospectus as Appendix B. We urge you to read this opinion in its entirety for a description of the procedures followed, assumptions made, matters
considered and limitations on the review undertaken. The opinion does not constitute a recommendation as to how any RoweCom stockholder should vote with respect to the merger.

(page 74)

    The
completion of the merger depends upon the satisfaction or waiver of a number of conditions, including, among others:

French subsidiary must have received a waiver and amendment to its existing loan with Banque Nationale de Paris, Banque Populare Region Quest de
Paris and Credit Lyonnais in a form acceptable to divine;


RoweCom

RoweCom
must have received a written opinion from its tax counsel or accountants to the effect that the merger will constitute a reorganization within the
meaning of Section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code for federal income tax purposes, and that opinion must not be withdrawn. 

 Termination 
(page 77)

    divine
and RoweCom can jointly terminate the merger agreement at any time before completing the merger, even if RoweCom stockholders have approved the merger. Either of divine or
RoweCom can also terminate the merger agreement if: 


we
do not complete the merger before December 31, 2001, so long as the failure to complete the merger is not the result of the failure of the
terminating party to fulfill its obligations under the merger agreement;


a
government or legal restraint does not permit completion of the merger;


RoweCom
stockholders do not adopt and approve the merger agreement and the merger at the special meeting; or


the
other party materially breaches its representations, warranties or covenants in the merger agreement and such breach has not been, or cannot be, cured
within 20 business days of the other party receiving notice of the breach. 

    In
addition, divine may terminate the merger agreement without completing the merger if: 


RoweCom
receives, or a third party publicly announces, an alternative acquisition proposal and either the special meeting does not occur and the merger is
not consummated by December 31, 2001, or the RoweCom stockholders do not approve and adopt the merger agreement and the merger;


RoweCom's
board of directors or a committee of the board withdraws or modifies its approval or recommendation of the merger;


in
response to a third-party tender offer or exchange offer, RoweCom takes any action other than rejection of the offer;


RoweCom's
board of directors recommends an alternative acquisition proposal to RoweCom stockholders;


RoweCom
or any of its officers or directors enters into discussions or negotiations regarding an alternative acquisition proposal in violation of the
merger agreement;


RoweCom
enters into an agreement regarding, or consummates, an acquisition transaction with a party other than divine or Knowledge Resources Acquisition
Corp.;


in
divine's reasonable judgment, RoweCom will not execute the senior credit agreement for financing its U.S. operations before December 31, 2001; or


the
RoweCom board of directors resolves to do any of the foregoing. 

    If
we do not consummate the merger, all fees and expenses incurred in connection with the merger agreement and the transactions it contemplates will be paid by the party incurring
those expenses. If we complete the merger, divine will pay all fees and expenses incurred in connection with the merger agreement and the transactions it contemplates. 

 Termination Fee 
(page 78)

    RoweCom
has agreed to pay divine a termination fee of $800,000 if the merger agreement is terminated by: 


divine
or RoweCom because RoweCom receives, or a third party publicly announces, an alternative acquisition proposal and either the special meeting does
not occur and the merger is not consummated by December 31, 2001, or the RoweCom stockholders do not approve and adopt the merger agreement and the merger;


divine
because RoweCom's board of directors or a committee of the board withdraws or modifies its approval or recommendation of the merger;


divine
because in response to a third-party tender offer or exchange offer, RoweCom takes any action other than rejection of the offer;


divine
because RoweCom's board of directors recommends an alternative acquisition proposal to RoweCom stockholders;


divine
because RoweCom or any of its officers or directors enters into discussions or negotiations regarding an alternative acquisition proposal in
violation of the merger agreement;


divine
because RoweCom enters into an agreement regarding, or consummates, an acquisition transaction with a party other than divine or Knowledge Resources
Acquisition Corp.; or


divine
because RoweCom attempts to terminate the merger agreement other than as provided in the merger agreement. 

    divine
must pay RoweCom a termination fee of $1,200,000 and reimburse RoweCom for expenses of up to $250,000 if divine terminates the merger agreement because, in divine's reasonable
judgment, RoweCom will not execute the senior credit agreement before December 31, 2001. 

 Interests of Certain Persons in the Merger 
(page 62)

    When
you consider the RoweCom board's recommendation in favor of the merger, you should be aware that a number of RoweCom directors and executive officers may have interests in the
merger that differ from, or are in addition to, your interests. In particular:


Dr. Richard
R. Rowe, RoweCom's chairman and chief executive officer, James Kryzwicki, RoweCom's chief operating officer, Charles Germain, RoweCom's
president of Europe, Asia-Pacific and Latin America operations, Ian Best, RoweCom's vice president and chief technical officer, and Rodney Smith, RoweCom's chief financial officer and
treasurer, have signed new employment agreements with RoweCom that will become effective at the time we complete the merger. Under these agreements, RoweCom will be obligated to pay to these officers
their salaries and provide them

with
other employee benefits for a period of time after their employment is terminated by RoweCom without cause or by the employee for good reason;


All
of the in-the-money options held by RoweCom's directors and executive officers, whether or not vested, will convert into fully exercisable options to
purchase shares of divine common stock upon consummation of the merger. The number of divine shares underlying the options and the exercise prices will be adjusted by the 0.75 exchange ratio as
described under "Treatment of Outstanding Options." Based upon divine's closing common stock price of $0.82 on September 10, 2001, RoweCom's directors and executive officers and
their affiliates did not hold any in-the-money options as of that date.


Dr. Rowe
and Philippe Villers, a director of RoweCom, are among the holders of the bridge notes and the related warrants to purchase RoweCom common
stock. Dr. Rowe holds $1,000,000 in aggregate principal amount of bridge notes and 163,993 related warrants. Mr. Villers directly and indirectly holds $1,435,000 in aggregate principal
amount of bridge notes and 235,330 related warrants. If we complete the merger, Dr. Rowe's bridge notes will be exchanged for an equal aggregate principal amount of notes that are convertible
into a number of shares of divine common stock that will be based on an agreed upon conversion price that will be tied to the market price of divine common stock over some period of time. In addition,
Dr. Rowe's RoweCom warrants will entitle him to purchase 122,994 shares of divine common stock at an expected exercise price of $6.67 per share for 75,000 of the warrants and
$3.12 per share for 47,994 of the warrants. With respect to Mr. Villers' bridge notes, $85,000 in aggregate principal amount of bridge notes will be repaid upon consummation of the merger and
the remaining $1,350,000 in aggregate principal of bridge notes will be exchanged for an equal aggregate principal amount of notes that are convertible into a number of shares of divine common stock
that will be based on the agreed upon conversion price. Mr. Villers' warrants will be exercisable for 176,497 shares of divine common stock at an expected exercise price of $6.67 per share for
107,625 of the warrants and $3.12 per share for 68,872 of the warrants. Dr. Rowe and Mr. Villers are among the noteholders who have requested that (1) the exercise price of the exchanged
warrants be decreased so that it is tied to the market price of divine common stock and (2) they be issued additional divine warrants;


If
we complete the merger, divine will honor existing indemnification obligations of RoweCom, indemnify directors and officers of RoweCom or its
subsidiaries for acts or omissions occurring prior to the merger for a period of six years after July 6, 2001 and provide indemnification arrangements for RoweCom's officers and directors that
are at least as favorable as those in RoweCom's current certificate of incorporation and bylaws for a period of six years after the merger; and


If
we complete the merger, divine will extend and maintain RoweCom's existing directors' liability and officers' liability, errors and omissions,
employment practices and fiduciary liability insurance policies for a period of at least six years to the extent the cost of extending and maintaining those policies does not exceed $700,000. 

In
addition, if at any time after the merger, we decide to discontinue active commercial use of the name "RoweCom," any related terms using the root term "Rowe" or the domain name "Rowe.com," we have
agreed to notify Dr. Rowe or his heirs, legatees, or assigns and, upon 

request, to assign the name or term to Dr. Rowe or his heirs, legatees or assigns for no additional consideration. 

 Material United States Federal Income Tax Consequences 
(page 65)

    RoweCom
stockholders generally will not recognize gain or loss for U.S. federal income tax purposes on their exchange of RoweCom common stock for divine common stock, except to the
extent that RoweCom stockholders receive cash in lieu of fractional shares. Tax matters are very complicated, and the tax consequences of the merger to you will depend on the facts of your particular
situation. You are urged to consult your own tax advisor as to the specific tax consequences to you of the merger, including the applicable federal, state, local and foreign tax consequences. 

 Accounting Treatment 
(page 62)

    divine
will record the merger using the purchase method of accounting in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. This means that for financial reporting
purposes, divine will treat both companies as one company beginning as of the date we complete the merger. In addition, under this method of accounting, divine will record the fair value of RoweCom's
assets and liabilities on its consolidated financial statements, with the remaining purchase price in excess of the fair value of RoweCom's net assets recorded as goodwill. 

 Regulatory Matters 
(page 64)

    Currently,
neither divine nor RoweCom is required to file any information with the Federal Trade Commission or the Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice under the provisions
of the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended, in connection with the merger. We are not aware of any other governmental approvals or actions that are required to
complete the merger other than compliance with federal securities laws and Delaware corporate law. 

 Dissenters' Rights 
(page 64)

    RoweCom
stockholders are not entitled to appraisal rights under Delaware law in connection with the merger. 

 Comparison of Stockholders' Rights 
(page 133)

    If
we complete the merger, you will become a stockholder of divine. divine's certificate of incorporation and bylaws differ from those of RoweCom, and, as a result, you will have
different rights as a divine stockholder. In addition, divine has a stockholders' rights plan that entitles holders of its common stock, in certain instances, to purchase shares of divine's
series A junior participating preferred stock.

Risk Factors
 (page 25)

    This
merger and an investment in divine common stock by the RoweCom stockholders involve certain risks and uncertainties, including risks related to the integration of our companies,
risks associated with a fixed exchange ratio and risks relating to the combined entity, including eshare and Open Market. See "Risk Factors" for a discussion of the risks 

and uncertainties that you should consider before you decide whether to approve the merger agreement and merger and thereby become a divine stockholder. 

divine's Recent Developments 
(page 93)

    Since July 1, 2001, divine has completed, or entered into agreements in connection with, a number of other acquisitions to further its business strategy.

 eshare Merger  

    On July 8, 2001, divine entered into an agreement and plan of merger with eshare communications, Inc., pursuant to which divine will acquire
eshare. eshare is a provider of customer interaction management, or CIM, software products and services. These CIM software applications enable eshare's customers to effectively manage new and
existing customers across multiple communications channels, including voice, email, interactive Web chat and voice-over-internet protocol. 

    Upon
consummation of the eshare merger, each of the approximately 21.9 million outstanding shares of eshare common stock will be converted into the right to receive shares of
divine common stock as follows: 


If
the average closing price on the Nasdaq National Market of divine common stock for the ten trading days ending two trading days before the closing date
of the eshare merger, which we refer to as the divine average closing price, is greater than $2.39 but less than $2.82, then eshare shareholders will receive 1.30 shares of divine common stock for
each eshare common share they own;


If
the divine average closing price is $2.82 or greater, then eshare shareholders will receive a number of shares of divine common stock for each eshare
common share they own equal to $3.653 divided by the divine average closing price; and


If
the divine average closing price is $2.39 or less, then eshare shareholders will receive a number of shares of divine common stock for each eshare
common share they own equal to $3.12 divided by the greater of the divine average closing price or $1.00. 

If pursuant to these adjustments, more than 28,546,506 shares of divine common stock are to be issued to eshare shareholders in the eshare merger, divine may elect to pay cash instead of any or all of
the excess shares in an amount per share equal to the divine average closing price. However, because divine and eshare intend for the merger to be a tax-free reorganization, divine will
not pay cash in excess of 50% of the total consideration paid to all eshare shareholders. Completion of the eshare merger is dependent on a number of conditions, including (1) approval by
eshare shareholders and, if necessary, divine stockholders and (2) expiration or termination of any waiting periods under any applicable antitrust laws.

The special meetings of eshare shareholders and divine stockholders are scheduled to be held on October   , 2001.

 Emicom Merger  

    On July 18, 2001, divine acquired 67% of the equity interests of Emicom Group, Inc. that divine did not already own in exchange for a total of
13.8 million shares of divine common stock. divine has filed a registration statement on Form S-3 to register these shares for resale. Emicom has been an associated
company of divine since April 2000, when divine acquired a

33% interest in Emicom. Emicom is a technology holding company that provides capital and advisory services to early-stage technology companies located in Israel. Emicom partners with
privately-held technology-related companies in the telecommunications, cellular, Internet infrastructure and enterprise software markets. At the time of the acquisition, Emicom held
interests in four technology-related companies and had approximately $34 million in uncommitted cash reserves. divine expects that Emicom will provide divine a base of operations in the Israeli
high-tech market, a platform from which to expand an international customer base and a channel for divine's expansion in Israel and Europe. 

 Intira Asset Acquisition  

    On July 29, 2001, divine entered into an agreement to purchase substantially all of the assets of Intira Corporation, subject to bankruptcy court
approval. Intira provides information technology and network infrastructure for online business applications and is based in Pleasanton, California. Under the terms of the purchase agreement, divine
will purchase substantially all of the assets of Intira for $1 million in cash, provide Intira with a $6.8 million debtor-in-possession credit facility and assume
certain obligations that divine intends to restructure on more favorable terms. divine expects that the acquisition of Intira's assets will expand divine's capabilities in its Managed Applications
business unit and provide opportunities for its other business units. 

 Fracta Networks Acquisition  

    In August 2001, divine acquired certain assets, subject to certain liabilities, of Fracta Networks, Inc., a provider of personal content
management solutions. Among the assets divine acquired was Fracta Networks' software, FractaNet, an application that allows users to easily capture portions of documents, spreadsheets or
Web sites. For these assets, divine issued warrants to purchase 1,000,000 shares of divine common stock. In addition, divine has agreed to grant Fracta Network's continuing employees options to
purchase 468,000 shares of divine common stock. 

 Open Market Merger  

    On August 15, 2001, divine entered into an agreement and plan of merger with Open Market, Inc., pursuant to which divine will acquire Open
Market. Open Market provides enterprise content management and delivery application software. Open Market's software solutions are designed to enable businesses and other organizations to use the
Internet to optimize interactions with their site visitors, employees, customers and distribution channels.

    Upon consummation of the Open Market merger, each outstanding share of Open Market common stock will be converted into the right to receive that number of shares of divine common
stock equal to 44,285,714 divided by the total number of shares of Open Market common stock deemed outstanding as of the closing of the merger, giving effect to the conversion of any then-outstanding
shares of Open Market Series E preferred stock but less shares of Open Market common stock issued after August 3, 2001 pursuant to Open Market's employee stock purchase plans and
exercises of Open Market options and warrants. The maximum Open Market exchange ratio will be 0.8394 and the minimum Open Market exchange ratio will be 0.8326. Completion of the Open Market merger is
dependent on a number of conditions, including (1) approval by Open Market stockholders and if necessary,

divine stockholders and (2) expiration or termination of any waiting periods under any applicable antitrust laws. The special meetings of Open Market stockholders and divine stockholders are
scheduled to be held on October   , 2001.

 marchFIRST GmbH iI Acquisition

    In September 2001, divine entered into an agreement to acquire substantially all of the assets of marchFIRST GmbH iI that comprised its former Munich
and Hamburg operations. divine has agreed to pay approximately DM 10.5 million (approximately US $4.8 million) for these assets. Upon completion of the acquisition, the
assets purchased from marchFIRST GmbH iI will operate as a wholly-owned subsidiary of divine under the name divine GmbH from offices in Munich and Hamburg.

 Parlano Acquisition

    On September 7, 2001, divine acquired from UBS AG a 21% equity interest in Parlano, Inc. in exchange for 3,596,007 shares of divine
common stock. divine has filed a registration statement on Form S-3 to register these shares for resale. Parlano has been an associated company of divine since February 2000, when divine
acquired a 75% equity interest in Parlano. As a result of the acquisition, divine now owns approximately 96% of the issued and outstanding capital stock of Parlano and intends to purchase the
remaining interest in a short-form merger in the near future. Parlano, which is headquartered in Chicago, Illinois, is a provider of global solutions for real-time business communications and
collaboration in an enterprise environment. The software licensed by Parlano allows information to be captured, filtered and stored in corporate databases and used in knowledge management
applications.

    We
anticipate that the integration of these acquired companies into our products and services offering will help us to deliver a combination of software, technology-based solutions,
professional services and hosting/managed applications that allow businesses to increase efficiency, generate revenue, advance their brand and build customer loyalty. 

SELECTED HISTORICAL AND PRO FORMA FINANCIAL DATA    

Selected Historical Financial Data of divine  

    We are providing the following divine selected historical consolidated financial information to aid you in your analysis of the financial aspects of the
merger. The following information is only a summary and should be read together with divine's consolidated audited and unaudited financial statements, the related notes and the discussion under

Selected Historical Financial Data of RoweCom  

We are providing the following RoweCom selected historical consolidated financial information to aid you in your analysis of the financial
aspects of the merger. The following information is only a summary and should be read together with RoweCom's audited and unaudited consolidated financial statements, the related notes and the
discussion contained in "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations of RoweCom" included in this proxy statement/prospectus. RoweCom derived its consolidated
statement of operations data for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2000, 1999 and 1998 and its consolidated balance sheet data as of December 31, 2000 and 1999 from its audited
consolidated financial statements, which are included in this proxy statement/prospectus. RoweCom derived its consolidated statement of operations data for the fiscal years ended December 31,
1997 and 1996 and its consolidated balance sheet data as of December 31, 1998, 1997 and 1996 from its audited consolidated financial statements, which are not included in this proxy
statement/prospectus. Those consolidated financial statements were audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, independent accountants. RoweCom derived its consolidated statement of operations data for the
six-month periods ended June 30, 2001 and 2000 and its consolidated balance sheet data as of June 30, 2001 from RoweCom's unaudited consolidated financial statements, which are included
in this proxy statement/prospectus. In the opinion of RoweCom's management, those unaudited consolidated financial statements include all adjustments, consisting only of normal recurring adjustments,
necessary for a fair statement of the information when read along with the audited financial statements and the related notes. RoweCom's operating results for the six months ended June 30, 2001
are not necessarily indicative of the results RoweCom may achieve for the entire year ending December 31, 2001.

Unaudited Selected Pro Forma Condensed Combined Financial Information  

    The following unaudited selected pro forma condensed combined financial information describes the pro forma effect of divine's proposed acquisition of RoweCom
on the:


unaudited
statements of operations for the six months ended June 30, 2001 and the year ended December 31, 2000 of divine; and


unaudited
balance sheet as of June 30, 2001 of divine.

The following unaudited selected pro forma condensed combined financial information also describes the pro forma effect of divine's proposed acquisitions of eshare communications, Inc. and Open
Market, Inc. discussed below. The purpose of this pro forma financial information is to demonstrate how the combined financial statements of these businesses might have appeared if each of the mergers
had been completed at the beginning of the periods presented.

    In addition to the pending merger between divine and RoweCom, on July 8, 2001, divine entered into a definitive agreement to acquire eshare, which provides customer interaction
management, or CIM, products and services. Completion of the eshare merger is subject to a number of conditions, including eshare shareholder approval and, if required, divine stockholder approval. In
addition, on August 15, 2001, divine entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Open Market, which provides enterprise content management and delivery application software to businesses and
other organizations. Completion of the Open Market merger is subject to a number of conditions, including Open Market stockholder approval and, if required, divine stockholder approval. The following
unaudited selected pro forma condensed combined financial information reflects the acquisition of RoweCom alone, as well as the acquisitions of RoweCom, eshare and Open Market together.

    divine has prepared the pro forma financial information using the purchase method of accounting for all these transactions. Because the pro forma financial information is based upon
the financial condition and operating results of RoweCom, eshare and Open Market during periods when they were not under the control, influence or management of divine, the information presented may
not be indicative of the results that would have actually occurred had the acquisitions been completed as of the respective periods presented, nor is it indicative of future financial or operating
results. divine expects to incur reorganization and integration expenses as well as potential operating efficiencies as a result of the acquisitions of RoweCom, eshare and Open Market. The unaudited
selected pro forma condensed combined financial information does not give effect to any synergies that may occur due to the integration of RoweCom, eshare and Open Market with divine, nor does it take
into account the effect of any potential changes to accounting policies, including with respect to the recognition of revenues, of the acquired entities after the mergers due to the integration of
their businesses into divine's business model. The unaudited selected pro forma condensed combined financial information should be read along with the historical financial statements of divine and the
related notes, incorporated by reference in this proxy statement/prospectus, the historical financial statements of RoweCom and the related notes, included elsewhere in this proxy statement/prospectus
and the unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information and the related notes, included elsewhere in this proxy statement/prospectus.

Comparative Per Share Data  

    We have summarized below certain (1) comparative per share data of divine, RoweCom, eshare and Open Market on a historical basis and (2) combined
per share data on an unaudited pro forma basis after giving effect to the RoweCom merger alone, as well as the RoweCom, eshare and Open Market mergers together, using the purchase method of accounting
as if the mergers occurred on January 1, 2000 and assuming that: 


0.75
of a share of divine common stock was issued in exchange for each share of RoweCom common stock outstanding;


2.935
shares of divine common stock were issued in exchange for each share of eshare common stock outstanding; and


.8326
shares of divine common stock were issued in exchange for each share of Open Market common stock outstanding.

    You
should read this data along with the historical consolidated financial statements and the related notes of divine incorporated by reference into this proxy statement/prospectus
and of RoweCom that are included elsewhere in this proxy statement/prospectus. We have presented the pro forma per share data for illustrative purposes only. This unaudited pro forma combined per
share data does not necessarily indicate the operating results that would have been achieved had the mergers been in effect as of the beginning of the periods presented, or the results of operations
or financial position that we will experience in the future.

Historical
book value per share is computed by dividing stockholders' equity (deficit) by the number of shares of common stock, net of treasury shares, outstanding at the end of
each period.

(2)
The
unaudited equivalent RoweCom pro forma per share amounts are calculated by multiplying the unaudited combined pro forma per divine share amounts by the exchange ratio of 0.75 of
a share of divine common stock for each outstanding share of RoweCom common stock.

(3)
Pro
forma book value per share is computed by dividing pro forma stockholders' equity by the pro forma number of shares of common stock and the exchangeable shares outstanding at
the end of the period.

    The market price of divine and RoweCom common stock will fluctuate between the date of this proxy statement/prospectus and the date on which
the merger occurs. We urge you to obtain current market quotations before making any decision about the merger. 

    Neither
divine nor RoweCom has ever paid any cash dividends on its stock. We anticipate that, for the foreseeable future, our combined enterprise will retain any earnings for use in
the operation of our business. Therefore, we do not anticipate paying cash dividends in the foreseeable future. 

RISK FACTORS    

    In addition to the other information contained or incorporated by reference in this proxy statement/prospectus, you should carefully consider the following
factors in voting on whether to adopt and approve the merger agreement and the merger and, therefore, your related investment in divine common stock. For periods following the merger, we have assumed
the consummation of the eshare and Open Market mergers and references to the products, businesses, financial results or financial condition of divine and RoweCom mean our combined enterprise and its
subsidiaries, including eshare and Open Market. We have divided the risks into three groups: risks relating to the proposed merger, risks relating to the combined entity, including eshare and Open
Market, and risks relating to ownership of divine common stock. References to "we," "us" and "our" in "Risks Relating to the Proposed Merger" refer to the combined divine/RoweCom entity
following completion of the RoweCom merger. References to "we," "us" and "our" in "Risks Relating to the Combined Entity" and "Risks Relating to Owning divine Common Stock"
refer to the combined divine/RoweCom/eshare/Open Market entity following completion of the mergers. 

Risks Relating to the Proposed Merger  

We may be unable to successfully integrate our operations and personnel and, as a result, may not realize the expected benefits of the
merger.  

    This merger requires the integration of our companies, which have previously operated independently. We may not accomplish this integration smoothly,
expeditiously, successfully, or at all. The successful combination of the companies will require significant effort, managerial resources, time and expense. divine and RoweCom have different systems
and procedures in many operational areas that must be rationalized and integrated. Integration also may be difficult because divine is based in Chicago, Illinois and RoweCom is presently based in
Westwood, Massachusetts, with significant operations abroad. This integration may be further complicated by the possible simultaneous integration of eshare's and Open Market's operations. While we
integrate operations, management may be distracted and employee uncertainty and lack of focus may disrupt our normal operations. As often occurs with mergers, during the pre-merger and
integration phases, competitors may intensify their efforts to recruit key employees. Employee uncertainty regarding the effects of the merger
could also increase turnover. Failure to quickly and effectively accomplish the integration of our operations could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of
operations. 

If we are unable to successfully integrate our products and technologies on a timely basis, we may not be able to operate efficiently or realize the expected
benefits of the merger.  

    After the merger, we will need to integrate our products and technologies. This integration may be difficult and unpredictable because divine's and RoweCom's
products were developed independently and without regard to this integration. In addition, divine has limited experience with the knowledge resource products sold by RoweCom. Successful integration
will also require coordination of different development and engineering teams, as well as sales and marketing efforts and personnel. This integration may take longer than expected, and the companies
may be required to expend more resources on integration than anticipated. The need to expend additional resources on our integration would reduce the resources that would otherwise be available to
develop new products and technologies. If we cannot integrate our 

products and technologies successfully and on a timely basis, we may not be able to operate efficiently or realize the expected benefits of the merger. 

Our customers may react unfavorably to the merger, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.

    The merger may disrupt our customer relationships. Uncertainty regarding the merger and our ability to effectively integrate our operations without a
significant reduction in the quality of product and service offerings may also cause some of our customers to explore alternatives. Further, customers may defer purchasing decisions as they evaluate
the likelihood of our successful integration. Any significant delay or loss of business from significant customers could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.

The value of shares of divine common stock that you will receive in the merger will fluctuate based on the price of divine common stock.  

    Under the merger agreement, the number of shares of divine common stock that you will receive in the merger for your shares of RoweCom is fixed. This means
that the exchange ratio of 0.75 will not be adjusted for changes in the market price of either divine or RoweCom common stock and neither company can terminate the merger agreement solely because of
changes in the market price of either company's common stock. Therefore, the value of the divine shares that you receive in the merger will depend on the market price of divine common stock at the
time of completion of the merger, which may vary from the market price on the date you submit your proxy and the date of the special meeting. The prices of divine and RoweCom common stock historically
have been volatile, and we cannot assure you what the market prices of the divine common stock or RoweCom common stock will be at the time of the merger. We advise you to obtain recent market
quotations for divine common stock and RoweCom common stock before making any decision about the merger.

Officers and directors of RoweCom have potential conflicts of interest in the merger.  

    Certain of RoweCom's executive officers and directors have interests in the merger that are different from, or in addition to, your interests. These interests,
which include employment agreements with Richard R. Rowe, James Krzywicki, Charles Germain, Ian Best and Rodney Smith, indemnification and insurance protections for management and the ownership
of options, warrants and notes that will become exercisable for, or convertible into, divine common stock, are described in more detail under the caption "The MergerInterests of Certain
Persons in the Merger" on page 62.

After the merger, stockholders of RoweCom will have different rights that may be less advantageous than their current rights.  

    Upon consummation of the merger, you will become divine stockholders. Differences in RoweCom's certificate of incorporation and bylaws and divine's certificate
of incorporation and bylaws, as well as divine's stockholders' rights plan, will result in changes to your rights when you become divine stockholders. See "Comparison of Stockholders' Rights"
beginning on page 131. You may conclude that your rights under divine's certificate of incorporation, bylaws and stockholders' rights plan are more limited than your current rights under RoweCom's
certificate of incorporation and bylaws.

Risks Relating to the Combined Entity  

divine has been in business for only two years, has little operating history and has a new business strategy that may continue to
change, which makes it difficult to evaluate its business.  

    divine was formed in May 1999 and began operations as an Internet holding company engaged in business-to-business
e-commerce through a community of associated companies. divine announced a new strategy to focus on enterprise Web solutions in February 2001. Because divine has only recently begun
operating under this new business strategy, there is limited data upon which you can evaluate its prospects. As we continue to analyze business plans and internal operations in light of market
developments, we may decide to make further substantial changes in our business plan and organization. These changes in business strategy may include moving into areas in which divine has little or no
experience. Furthermore, our future business strategy will depend on our ability to successfully acquire and integrate other businesses as we continue to seek to expand our portfolio of products and
services. We are, and will remain for the foreseeable future, subject to risks, expenses and uncertainties frequently encountered by young companies, and it will continue to be difficult to evaluate
our business and its likelihood of success. 

Our overall performance and quarterly operating results may fluctuate and will be affected by the revenues generated from RoweCom's, eshare's and Open Market's
products and services and RoweCom's need for additional capital.  

    We expect RoweCom's, eshare's and Open Market's revenues to comprise a significant portion of our revenues for the near future. In particular, we expect
RoweCom's revenues to represent a significant portion of our revenues because RoweCom historically has recognized as revenue its cost of the knowledge resources it sells plus the fee retained by
RoweCom. Fluctuations in the revenue generated from our offering of RoweCom's knowledge resources, eshare's CIM solutions and Open Market's e-business solutions will likely impact our
overall performance, and risks relating to these knowledge resources, CIM solutions and e-business solutions may affect our success as a whole. divine's, RoweCom's, eshare's and Open
Market's revenues and results of operations have varied substantially from quarter to quarter. We expect large fluctuations in our future quarterly operating results due to a number of factors,
including: 


the
success of, and costs associated with, acquisitions, joint ventures or other strategic relationships; 

losses
or charges incurred by associated companies that may include significant write-downs, write-offs and impairment charges; 

the
level of product and price competition; 

the
length of our sales and implementation process; 

the
size and timing of individual transactions; 

seasonal
trends; 

the
mix of products and services sold; 

software
defects and other product quality problems; 

the
timing of new product introductions and enhancements by us or our competitors; 


customer
order deferrals in anticipation of enhancements or new products to be offered by us or our competitors; 

changes
in foreign currency exchange rates; 

customers'
fiscal constraints; and 

general
economic conditions. 

    In
addition, RoweCom's revenue flow is seasonal in nature and as a result RoweCom periodically will have to rely on financing from divine or third parties to support its needs for
working capital. RoweCom has an established practice of paying some of its publishers 30 to 60 days before receipt of funds from customers. Consequently, RoweCom anticipates making substantial
expenditures in the fourth quarter of each year, while receiving the majority of its cash receipts relating to those purchases late in the first quarter of the following year. Given these seasonal
cash flow imbalances, if RoweCom has an unexpected demand for liquid capital, or does not have financing available on commercially reasonable terms, or at all, when needed, it could have a material
adverse effect on our future results of operations and financial condition. 

We expect to incur losses for the foreseeable future, and we may never become profitable.  

    divine incurred net losses of approximately $9,407,000 for the period from inception on May 7, 1999 through December 31, 1999, approximately
$470,319,000 for the year ended December 31, 2000, and approximately $104,132,000 for the six months ended June 30, 2001. The majority of these losses were related to the consolidated
operations of divine's associated companies and charges divine took to reduce the carrying value of these associated companies. In addition: 


RoweCom
incurred net losses of approximately $7,630,000 for the year ended December 31, 1998, $15,067,000 for the year ended December 31,
1999, $83,981,000 for the year ended December 31, 2000 and $16,922,000 for the six months ended June 30, 2001; 

Open
Market incurred net losses of approximately $36,970,000 for the year ended December 31, 1998, $19,780,000 for the year ended
December 31, 1999, $37,796,000 for the year ended December 31, 2000 and $14,702,000 for the six months ended June 30, 2001; and 

eshare
incurred net losses of approximately $9,958,000 for the year ended December 31, 1999, $11,117,000 for the year ended December 31, 2000
and $3,197,000 for the six months ended June 30, 2001. 

We
expect to incur additional losses for the foreseeable future. Furthermore, we expect our operating expenses to increase significantly as we continue to develop the infrastructure necessary to
implement our current business strategy and integrate acquired businesses.
Changes to our business strategy and product lines may cause us to incur additional expenses. Our financial results will continue to be affected by the operations of divine's existing associated
companies, some of which may cease operations in the future if they are unable to generate positive cash flow. To the extent that our revenues do not increase at a sufficient rate, we may not be able
to achieve and maintain profitability. 

The failure of the eshare and/or the Open Market merger to close could adversely impact divine's business strategy and the market value of divine's common
stock.  

    This merger, the eshare merger and the Open Market merger are each proceeding separately. None of the mergers is subject to, or conditioned upon, the
consummation of the other mergers. As a result, it is possible that we complete this merger, but the eshare merger and/or the Open Market merger fail to close. The failure to close one or both of the
other mergers could adversely affect divine's implementation of its enterprise Web solutions strategy and could be negatively viewed by analysts or investors, which in turn could cause the value of
divine's common stock to decline. 

If we do not successfully implement our acquisition strategy or address the risks associated with the acquisitions, our growth and ability to compete may be
impaired.  

    Our business strategy includes the acquisition of other businesses that are complementary to ours, including other providers of enterprise software products or
professional services. We may not be able to identify suitable acquisition candidates available for sale at reasonable prices, consummate any acquisitions, including the proposed eshare and Open
Market mergers, or successfully integrate any acquired businesses, including eshare or Open Market, into our operations. Acquisitions, including the proposed eshare and Open Market mergers, involve a
number of special risks and challenges, including: 


diversion
of management's attention; 

assimilation
of the operations and personnel of acquired companies; 

incorporation
of acquired products into existing product lines; 

adverse
short-term effects on reported operating results;


assumption
of the liabilities of acquired companies, including, for example, the potential liability of RoweCom for (1) the securities class action
lawsuits described under "Information Regarding RoweComLegal Proceedings" on page 112 and (2) sales taxes for prior periods as described under "Management's Discussion and
Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations of RoweComOverviewSales Tax" on page 117;


possible
loss of key employees; and 

difficulty
of presenting a unified corporate image. 

If
we are unable to successfully implement our acquisition strategy or address the risks associated with acquisitions, our growth and ability to compete may be impaired. 

    If
we engage in future acquisitions, we might finance these acquisitions with available cash, the proceeds from possible debt financing or the issuance of additional common or
preferred stock, or a combination of the foregoing. We may not be able to arrange adequate financing on acceptable terms. If we consummate one or more significant acquisitions by issuing additional
equity securities, the market price of our common stock could decline and our stockholders could suffer significant dilution of their interests in us. Furthermore, sellers may be reluctant to accept
divine common stock as consideration at its recent price level and given its historical volatility, in which case, our ability to complete further transactions could be significantly limited. 

    For most of the businesses that we may acquire, we will likely have to record significant goodwill and other intangible assets, and generally accepted accounting principles may
require us to recognize substantial amortization charges on the other intangible assets, reducing our
future reportable earnings. We will also have to periodically test our goodwill and other intangible assets for impairment. If we determine that the value of the goodwill and/or the intangible assets
have been impaired, we will be required to recognize substantial charges that would adversely affect our operating results. In addition, these acquisitions could involve significant
non-recurring acquisition-related charges, such as the write-off or write-down of software development costs or other intangible items. 

Our failure to retain key personnel may adversely affect our business.  

    Our success depends partly upon our ability to retain senior executives and other key employees who are critical to the continued advancement, development and
support of our products and services and ongoing sales and marketing efforts. For example, the future operating results we derive from the sale of RoweCom's knowledge resources will depend in
significant part upon the continued services of a relatively small number of key technical, sales and senior management personnel, particularly Dr. Richard R. Rowe, RoweCom's chairman of the
board and chief executive officer. The loss of any key personnel or any significant group of employees could negatively affect our future business and prospects. If our management does not succeed in
their roles or we are not able to effectively allocate management responsibilities and cause our officers and senior managers to operate effectively as a group, our business could be adversely
affected. 

    Employee
morale and our ability to attract and retain qualified employees may also be adversely affected by the decline and substantial fluctuation in the market price of divine
common stock since its initial public offering, as many divine employees hold options with exercise prices far higher than divine's recent stock price. 

Revenues from our professional services division are difficult to predict because they are derived from project-based engagements.

    For
the six months ended June 30, 2001, divine derived approximately 92% of its revenues from professional services. Almost all of these revenues were from project-based client
engagements, which vary in size and scope. As a result, the revenues of our professional services division are difficult to predict because a client that accounts for a significant portion of these
revenues in one period may not generate a similar amount of revenues, if any, in subsequent periods. In addition, because many of our professional services engagements involve sequential stages, each
of which may represent a separate contractual commitment, a client may choose not to retain us for subsequent stages of an engagement or for new professional services projects. 

If we cannot keep our billable professionals engaged on client projects, our future revenues could decline and our operating results could be adversely
affected.  

    Virtually all the client contracts of our professional services division allow the client to terminate our services on relatively short notice and do not
guarantee us any specific or minimum amount of business from the client. To the extent that any significant clients decrease their use of our professional services, delay an engagement or terminate
their relationship with us, the revenues of our professional services division could decline substantially and our overall operating results could be adversely affected to the extent we are unable to
quickly redeploy our billable professionals to other client engagements. 

We may not be able to compete successfully against current and future competitors, and competitive pressures faced by us could hurt our business and financial
results.  

    The market for our products and services is intensely competitive, fragmented and subject to rapid change. As a result of this merger and the eshare and Open
Market mergers, we will compete with a variety of companies that provide software solutions and professional services independently or on an integrated basis. We may not be able to compete
successfully against current and future competitors, and competitive pressures faced by us could hurt our business and financial results. Furthermore, many of our current and potential competitors
have longer operating histories, significantly greater financial, technical, product development and marketing resources, greater name recognition and a larger customer base than we do. 

    The
market for the sale of magazines, newspapers, journals and e-journals, books and other knowledge resources to businesses is intensely and increasingly competitive.
Although RoweCom has not yet had significant direct competition from other companies offering a service for purchasing and managing the acquisition of subscriptions and books with comparable
management control features, EBSCO Industries, Inc. has recently launched a desktop e-commerce service that is similar to RoweCom's kStore. Thus, we expect that significant
competition will develop in the near future with respect to RoweCom's knowledge resource products, and it may adversely impact our business. 

    eshare's
primary competitors in the field of integrated inbound/outbound telephony-based call management systems have been Davox Corporation, SER Systeme AG, formerly EIS
International, Inc., and Avaya, Inc., formerly Mosaix International, Inc. We will continue to compete primarily against Davox and Avaya in the collections segment of the outbound
call management systems market, and against SER Systeme in the telemarketing and telesales segments of the inbound/outbound call management systems market. We will also compete in the computer
telephony integration segment of the market, where principal competitors include Interactive Intelligence, Inc., Genesys Telecommunications Laboratories/Alcatel, and Stratasoft Corp., Apropos
Technology, Castel, Inc. and CellIT, Inc., among others. In the future, we may also face additional direct competition from private branch exchange/automatic call distribution vendors,
other telecommunications equipment providers, telecommunications service providers, computer hardware and software vendors and others. Furthermore, in the Internet-based CIM industry, our competitors
will include eGain Communications Corporation, Kana Software, Inc., Cisco Systems, Inc., Face Time Communications, Inc., LivePerson, Inc., People Support, Inc. and
Siebel Systems, Inc. 

    Open
Market's primary competition in the e-business content management market includes in-house development efforts by prospective customers, other vendors of application software or
application development platforms and tools directed at interactive commerce and financial services, such as Art Technology Group, Inc., BroadVision, Inc., Documentum, Inc., Interwoven, Inc. and
Vignette Corporation. In addition, larger companies with much broader product offerings, such as BEA Systems, Inc., IBM Corporation, Microsoft Corporation and Oracle Corporation, may bundle their
products to discourage users from purchasing Open Market's products. Companies such as IBM, BEA Systems and iPlanet E-Commerce Solutions also may add content management functionality to
their application servers or introduce their own content management software. 

    divine
competes in various market segments that are extremely competitive, highly fragmented and subject to rapid change. While we offer an increasingly comprehensive range 

of advanced enterprise solutions, we compete with various providers of one or more components of our solutions. In the enterprise portal software and services segment, according to Delphi Research and
the Yankee Group, the leading portal application makers in 2000 included: Plumtree Software, Inc., Hummingbird Ltd., Viador Inc., Sequoia Software Corporation, acquired by Citrix
Systems, Inc., and InfoImage, Inc., among others. We believe that additional competitors in the broader advanced enterprise solutions market include: IBM Corporation,
PeopleSoft, Inc., BEA Systems, Inc., Microsoft Corporation, Sybase, Inc., Oracle Corporation, Computer Associates International, Inc., Epicentric, Inc.,
BroadVision, Inc., Vignette Corporation, Citrix Systems, Inc., Open Text Corporation, Top Tier Software, Inc., DataChannel, Inc., Tibco Software Inc., SAP AG,
American Express Company and InfoSys Consulting Inc. 

If we do not expand our customer base, we may never become profitable and our stock price will likely decline.  

    The market for many of our products and services is newly emerging. As a result, we cannot accurately estimate the potential demand for them. We believe that
market acceptance of our products and services depends principally on our ability to: 


develop
or acquire products and services that meet changing customer needs in a timely fashion; 

effectively
market our products and our services; 

hire,
train, and retain a sufficient number of qualified sales and marketing personnel; 

provide
high-quality and reliable customer support for our products; 

distribute
and price our products and services in a manner that is more appealing to customers than that of our competitors; 

develop
a favorable reputation among our customers, potential customers and participants in the software industry; and 

withstand
downturns in general economic conditions or conditions that would slow corporate spending on software products and professional services. 

Our
inability to accomplish any of the foregoing may limit our ability to expand our customer base. If our customer base does not expand, we may never become profitable and our stock price will likely
decline. Furthermore, the adoption of networks for book and subscription procurement, particularly by companies that have relied on traditional means of procurement, will require broad acceptance of
the new approach. In addition, companies that have already
invested substantial resources in traditional methods of procurement may be reluctant to adopt a new strategy. This could limit the growth of our revenues derived from the merger. 

Our success is dependent upon the market for Internet services, which, along with the general economy, is experiencing a downturn.

    During
late 2000 and 2001, the market for Internet services and technology has experienced a significant decline. This decline is at least partly attributable to funding difficulties
experienced by many smaller companies and a general economic slowdown. Both developments have caused many of our current and potential clients to cancel, reduce and/or delay some projects. A prolonged
economic slowdown or continued uncertainty about the future of the market for Internet services will adversely affect our business and financial 

results. If demand for our products and services does not improve, increased competition for business may result in significant decreases in the prices we charge for our products and services. The
market for our products and services may not improve in a timely manner or to the extent necessary to allow us to achieve and sustain profitability in the near future. 

Our success will depend upon the ability of our products to work with a large variety of hardware, software, database and networking systems.  

    The success of our products will depend on the ability of our products to integrate and be compatible with customer systems, particularly hardware systems,
operating systems and data sources, as well as, or better than, competing products. The success of our products will also depend on the ability of our existing products to work well with one another,
with new products we develop and with new software developed by third parties. We currently serve, and intend to continue to serve, a customer base with a wide variety of hardware, software, database
and networking systems. If we cannot support an increasing number of systems in the future, we may not gain broad market acceptance. 

Customers will be less likely to accept our products if we are unable to introduce in a timely manner new software products and enhancements that meet industry
requirements.  

    The market for our software products is subject to rapid technological change, changing customer needs, frequent new product introductions and evolving
industry standards that may render our existing products and services obsolete. As a result, unforeseen changes in customer and technological requirements for application features, functions and
technologies could limit our ability to develop market share or could rapidly erode our position in those markets in which we have an established presence. Our growth and future operating results will
depend in part upon our ability to develop and introduce new applications that anticipate, meet or exceed technological advances in the marketplace, meet changing customer requirements, respond to
competitive products and achieve market acceptance. 

    New
products, platforms and language support can require long development and testing periods. New products or enhancements may not be released according to schedule or may contain
defects when released. Either situation could result in adverse publicity, loss of sales, delay in market acceptance of our products or customer claims against us, any of which could harm our
business. Our product acquisition, development and testing efforts have required, and are expected to continue to require, substantial investments. We may not possess sufficient resources to make
these necessary investments. 

    We
also expect to develop and introduce new and enhanced versions of products as an integrated suite. In addition to the risks and uncertainties inherent in the development and
introduction of new products, we will face significant challenges in developing and introducing new products and versions that work together effectively and allow customers to achieve the benefits of
a broader product offering. We may not be able to identify or overcome these challenges. 

If we cannot cross-sell the products and services of divine, RoweCom, eshare and Open Market to the other companies' customers, we will not achieve
one of the expected benefits of the mergers.  

    After the RoweCom, eshare and Open Market mergers, we intend to offer the products and services of RoweCom, eshare and Open Market to existing divine customers
and the customers of each other acquired company, and divine's products to existing RoweCom, eshare and Open Market customers. One company's customers may not have an interest in 

the other companies' products and services. If we fail to cross-market our products and services, we will not achieve one of the expected benefits of the mergers, and this failure could have a
material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results. 

We expect that our future revenues and operating results will be adversely affected if the software application industry continues to evolve toward a
subscription-based model.  

    We expect that our revenue growth rates and operating results will be adversely affected as more customers require us to offer our products under a
subscription-based application service provider model. We currently sell software application solutions on a perpetual license basis in exchange for an up-front license fee. Many of our
customers are attempting to reduce their up-front capital expenditures by purchasing software applications under a hosted subscription service model. Under the hosted model, the customer
subscribes to use an application from the software provider. Generally, the application is hosted on a server managed by the software provider or a third-party hosting service. We expect that
subscription-based revenues will represent a substantial portion of future revenues generated by our software applications and managed applications divisions. 

    Under
the subscription-based model, we generally will recognize revenue and receive payment ratably over the term of a customer's subscription. As a result, our revenue growth rate
under a subscription model may be less than what our revenue growth rate would be under a license model. In addition, the price of our services will be fixed at the time of entering into the
subscription agreement. If we are unable to adequately predict the costs associated with maintaining and servicing a customer's subscription, then the periodic expenses associated with a subscription
may exceed the revenues we recognize for the subscription in the same period, which would adversely affect our operating results. In addition, if we are not successful in implementing the
subscription-based model, or if market analysts or investors do not believe that the model is attractive relative to our existing license model, our business could be impaired and our stock price
could decline. 

Our business may be adversely affected if there are defects in our software or we are unable to acquire third-party software or hardware that is
error-free.  

    Software products as complex as those that we offer may contain errors that could be detected at any point in the products' life cycles. divine, RoweCom,
eshare and Open Market have, in the past, discovered software errors in certain of their products and have experienced delays in shipment or implementation of products during the period required to
correct these errors. Despite extensive testing by us and by current and potential customers, errors in our software may be found in the future. This could result in a loss of, or delay in, market
acceptance and sales, diversion of development resources, injury to our reputation or increased service and warranty cost. In particular, the call center environment in which eshare operates is
characterized by a wide variety of standard and non-standard configurations that make pre-release testing for programming or compatibility errors very difficult and time
consuming and will limit our ability to uncover all defects prior to shipment and installation at a customer's location. We also license certain software used in our products from third parties, and
our products are designed to operate on certain hardware platforms manufactured by third parties. Third-party software or hardware may contain errors that we are dependent upon others to correct.
These errors could cause problems with the installation and operation of our products, which could harm our business. 

We may face potential liability to customers if our products or our customers' systems fail.  

    Our software, portal and application products are often critical to the operations of our customers' businesses and provide benefits that may be difficult to
quantify. If one of our products or a customer's system fails, the customer could make a claim for substantial damages against us, regardless of our responsibility for such failure. The limitations of
liability set forth in our contracts may not be enforceable in all instances and may not otherwise protect us from liability for damages. Our insurance coverage may not continue to be available on
reasonable terms or in sufficient amounts to cover one or more large claims. In addition, the insurer might disclaim coverage as to any future claim. If we experience one or more large claims against
us that exceed available insurance coverage or result in changes in our insurance policies, including premium increases or the imposition of large deductible or co-insurance requirements,
our business and financial results could be hurt. 

We could lose our competitive advantage if we fail to adequately protect our proprietary rights, and any related litigation could be costly and
time-consuming.  

    We rely on a combination of patent, copyright, trade secret and trademark laws, confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions to protect our
proprietary rights in our products and technology. These measures may not be adequate to protect our trade secrets and proprietary technology. As a result, unauthorized third parties may copy or
otherwise obtain and use our products or technology. We may not be able to detect all instances of infringement. Furthermore, we may be subject to additional risks as we enter into transactions in
countries where intellectual property laws are not well-developed or are poorly enforced. Legal protections of our rights may be ineffective in these countries. If we must engage in
litigation to defend and enforce our intellectual property rights, either domestically or in other countries, we could face substantial costs and diversion of resources, regardless of the final
outcome of such litigation. Any future attempt by us to enforce our intellectual property rights might not be successful or might result in royalties that do not exceed the cost of such enforcement
efforts. Even if we succeed in protecting our intellectual property, others may independently develop similar technologies or products that do not infringe on our intellectual property. 

Other companies may claim that our products infringe their intellectual property rights, which could harm our business.  

    Third parties may claim that we are infringing their intellectual property rights. We expect that the risk of infringement claims will rise as the number of
products and competitors in our industry grows and the functionality of products in different industry segments overlaps. To develop our services or products, we may need to acquire licenses for
intellectual property to avoid infringement of a third party's product. These licenses may not be available on commercially reasonable terms, if at all. Former employers of our present and future
employees may assert claims that these employees improperly disclosed confidential or proprietary information to us. Any such claims could be time-consuming to defend, result in costly
litigation, divert management's attention and resources, cause product shipment delays or require us to pay money damages or enter into royalty or licensing agreements. These royalty or licensing
agreements may not be available on terms acceptable to us, if at all. In the event of a successful claim of product infringement against us and our failure or inability to license the infringed or
similar technology, our business, operating results and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected. 

We may not be able to prevent online security breaches, which could interrupt our operations, damage our reputation and expose us to liability.  

    A party that is able to circumvent our security systems or the security systems of our customers could steal proprietary information or cause interruptions in
our operations. Security breaches could also damage our reputation and expose us to a risk of loss or litigation and possible liability. Our insurance policies have coverage limits and exclusions that
may prevent reimbursement for losses caused by security breaches. Furthermore, our servers may be vulnerable to computer viruses, physical or electronic break-ins and similar disruptions.
We may need to expend significant additional capital and other resources to protect against security breaches or to alleviate problems caused by any breaches. Despite these efforts, we may not be able
to prevent all security breaches. 

Future government regulation could place financial burdens on our business.  

    Because of the Internet's popularity and increasing use, new laws and regulations may be adopted that could have an adverse effect on us. In particular, states
may impose
discriminatory, multiple or special taxes on the Internet if the current moratorium on the application of these taxes, due to end on October 21, 2001, is not extended. If the moratorium ends,
federal taxes may also be imposed on the sale of goods over the Internet. These state and federal taxes could cause a decrease in the volume of e-commerce and, therefore, the demand for
our products and services. The enactment of any additional laws or regulations, including international laws and regulations, could impede the growth of the Internet and e-commerce, which
could decrease our revenue and place additional financial burdens on our business. 

    Federal,
state or foreign agencies have also adopted, and may continue to adopt, laws or regulations affecting the use of outbound call processing systems. These laws or regulations
could limit the market for eshare's products or expose us to liability, which could materially adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition. 

Legal restrictions relating to the privacy of Internet users and the collection and use of online data could limit the utility of the personalization
functionality of eshare's and Open Market's products and, therefore, the attractiveness of those products to customers.  

    One of the principal features of eshare's and Open Market's products is the ability to develop and maintain profiles of online users to assist business
managers in personalizing content and in displaying tailored commercial offers to specific online users. By limiting the means in which this feature can be utilized, proposed and existing legal
restrictions on the collection and use of information relating to Internet users could materially and adversely impact eshare's and Open Market's products. For example, legislation has been proposed
in some jurisdictions that would regulate the practice of placing small information files, or "cookies," on a user's hard drive to gather information. Likewise, regulation of the practice of online
preference marketing is also under consideration in many jurisdictions. Moreover, legislation regulating the collection of data online and offline is already in place in the United States and
elsewhere, including the European Union, and applicable to certain populations and in certain sectors. While regulatory and legislative efforts in this area are relatively new and still developing,
they continue to gain attention, and continued regulation and legislation in this area could adversely affect the demand for eshare's and Open Market's products. 

If we lost the services of Andrew J. Filipowski, our business could fail.  

    We believe that Andrew J. Filipowski, our chairman and chief executive officer, is critical to our success. If we lost the services of Mr. Filipowski,
our ability to promote our business and raise additional capital would be severely limited, and our business could fail. We do not maintain key man life insurance on Mr. Filipowski. 

Our key personnel have entered into non-compete agreements that could prevent us from engaging in certain activities and acquiring interests in
some companies.  

    Andrew J. Filipowski, our chairman and chief executive officer, Michael P. Cullinane, our executive vice president, chief financial officer and treasurer and a
director, and Paul L. Humenansky, our president and chief operating officer and a director, have entered into consulting and non-compete agreements with PLATINUM 

technology
 International, 
inc.
, now a wholly-owned subsidiary of Computer Associates
International, Inc. These agreements prohibit Mr. Filipowski until June 29, 2007, and each of Messrs. Cullinane and Humenansky until June 29, 2004, from
participating or engaging, directly or indirectly, in the development, manufacture, marketing or distribution of any products or services offered by PLATINUM as of March 29, 1999, or any
products or services offered by PLATINUM after that date and in which they had actively participated. PLATINUM was, as of March 29, 1999, and continues to be, engaged in the business of
developing, marketing and supporting software products for managing information technology infrastructures and providing related professional services. As of March 29, 1999, PLATINUM also
offered products and services for the creation, deployment and management of Web content. Under these agreements, Messrs. Filipowski, Cullinane and Humenansky also are prohibited from
soliciting, or assisting another person to solicit or attempt to solicit, persons or entities that were current customers of PLATINUM or its affiliates before the end of the respective employment
periods of Messrs. Filipowski, Cullinane and Humenansky, unless the solicitation of these customers is for goods or services unrelated to any activity which competes with PLATINUM. 

    To
manage divine's business effectively with respect to these agreements, divine has consulted with PLATINUM and Computer Associates before making any acquisition to confirm that a
breach of these agreements would not result. PLATINUM and Computer Associates have consented to this merger and to the eshare and Open Market mergers. In the future, however, these consulting and
non-compete agreements could limit our business opportunities, which could impair our success. 

If Reed Elsevier or any of the other suppliers with whom RoweCom does business stops providing knowledge resources to RoweCom on favorable terms, we may not be
able to satisfy customers' demands at acceptable prices.  

    The primary supplier of the magazines and journals whose subscriptions RoweCom sells is Reed Elsevier, which supplied titles accounting for approximately 16%
and 13% of RoweCom's sales for the year ended December 31, 1999 and 2000, respectively. RoweCom currently does not have a contract with Reed Elsevier. If Reed Elsevier stops offering RoweCom
knowledge resources on favorable terms, we may not be able to offer customers competitive prices on their orders. If Reed Elsevier were to cease providing RoweCom with knowledge resources, it would
not be possible to obtain replacements for many of the titles Reed Elsevier publishes at a comparable price, if at all, from another supplier. Either of these events could have a material adverse
effect on our financial condition and results of 

operations. Similarly, if any of the other suppliers with whom RoweCom does business decides not to provide RoweCom with knowledge resources or decides to stop providing RoweCom with knowledge
resources on favorable terms, it could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. 

We may not be able to expand RoweCom's catalog of knowledge resources.  

    One of the key elements of RoweCom's strategy is to continue to expand its catalog of knowledge resources. RoweCom gains content through acquisitions and
strategic alliances and through contact with various suppliers. We may not be able to continue to gain available content through strategic alliances or directly from suppliers. In the event that we
are unable to continue to increase RoweCom's available content, we may: 


be
at a competitive disadvantage with respect to competitors that may compile greater libraries of available titles;


lose
clients that rely upon RoweCom as a single-source of knowledge resources; and


be
unable to increase the amount of revenue that is otherwise generated from particular clients. 

Any
of these effects could have a material adverse effect on our future results of operations and financial condition. 

Delays in sales and the implementation cycle for CIM solutions and managed applications could adversely affect us.  

    If we experience delays in, or cancellation of, sales or implementations of CIM solutions and managed applications, our business and financial results could be
hurt. To sell these products, we generally must provide a significant level of education to prospective customers regarding their use and benefits. In addition, prospective customers generally make a
significant commitment of resources in connection with the implementation of these products. For these and other reasons, the length of time between the date of initial contact with the potential
customer and the installation and use of eshare products has generally been six months or more. Our implementation cycle could be lengthened in the future by delays over which we have little or no
control and increases in the size and complexity of our installations and in the number of third-party systems with which our products must integrate. In addition, any unexpected delays in individual
implementations could expose us to liability claims from our customers. 

We expect that our future operating results will be significantly dependent on a limited suite of eshare and Open Market products and the market for these
products.  

    eshare traditionally has derived a majority of its revenues from sales of its Conversations call center management product, its NetAgent
Web-collaboration product and related services and support. eshare introduced Conversations in 1999 and NetAgent in 1998. eshare is currently in the process of developing next generation
CIM applications and expects to begin beta trials in 2001. In the near term, we anticipate that a significant portion of our eshare-related revenue may be derived from eshare's Conversations and
NetAgent product offerings and related services and support. We intend to enhance these products and develop market-specific solutions. However, any factor adversely affecting the market for call
center and Internet-based solutions in general, or the Conversations and NetAgent products in particular, 

could hurt our business and financial results. We also may face potential charges resulting from the write-down of inventory of outdated products that we cannot sell. 

    Open
Market expects to derive substantially all of its product license revenues in the future from its recently announced Content Server Enterprise Edition software. Our future growth
and profitability will depend on the successful release, introduction and customer acceptance
of this new suite of products and future enhancements to these products. Any factors adversely affecting the pricing of, demand for or market acceptance of these products, including competition or
technological change, could cause our revenues to decline and our business and future operating results to suffer. 

eshare has traditionally relied on a few customers for a significant portion of its revenues.  

    eshare has historically derived, and we believe that we will continue to derive, a significant portion of call center revenues in any period from a limited
number of large corporate clients. In 2000, eshare's five largest customers accounted for approximately 17% of its total revenues. During 1999, eshare's five largest customers accounted for
approximately 28% of its total revenues. The loss, deferral or cancellation of an order from one of these customers could have a significant impact on our operating results. eshare's current customers
may not place additional orders and we may not obtain orders of similar magnitude from other customers. If we fail to retain any major customer of eshare, suffer any reduction, delay in or
cancellation of orders by any such customer or fail to market successfully CIM solutions to new customers, our business and financial results could be hurt. 

    Open Market is party to several securities class action lawsuits that may be costly to defend and the outcome of which is uncertain and
may harm our business.  

    Open Market and several of its former and present officers and directors are named as defendants in several class action complaints filed on behalf of certain
of its stockholders who purchased securities between November 8, 1999 and April 18, 2000. These complaints allege violations of Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule
10b-5 promulgated under the Exchange Act. In particular, they allege, among other things, that during the putative class period, the defendants sought to mislead the investing public by overstating
Open Market's prospects and the quality of its products. The plaintiffs are seeking monetary damages and other appropriate relief. Any resolution of this litigation in a manner adverse to Open Market
could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, the costs to us of defending this litigation or other related proceedings, even if
resolved in our favor, could be substantial. This litigation could also substantially divert the attention of our management and resources in general. Uncertainties resulting from the initiation and
continuation of this litigation or other related proceedings could harm our ability to compete in the marketplace. 

Our strategy to expand our international operations is subject to many risks that may prevent us from maintaining or increasing our international revenues.  

    RoweCom's sales outside the United States accounted for approximately 42% and 51% of its total revenues in 1999 and 2000, respectively. eshare's sales outside
the United States accounted for approximately 32% and 28% of its total revenues in 1999 and 2000, respectively. Open Market's sales outside of North America accounted for approximately 30% and 40% of
its total revenues in 1999 and 2000, respectively. A significant element of our

business strategy is to expand our international presence through RoweCom's, eshare's and Open Market's operations and sales channels in international markets. This projected expansion will require
significant management attention and financial resources. Because of the difficulty in penetrating new markets, we may not be able to maintain or increase international revenues. Our international
operations will be subject to a number of inherent risks, which will increase as we expand our international operations, including: 


significant
volatility in the level and timing of business;


the
impact of possible recessionary environments in economies outside the United States;


changes
in foreign legal and regulatory requirements;


changes
in tariffs;


the
costs of localizing products for foreign markets and integrating products with foreign system components;


longer
accounts receivable collection periods and greater difficulty in accounts receivable collection;


difficulties
and costs of staffing and managing foreign operations;


reduced
protection for intellectual property rights in some countries;


potentially
adverse tax consequences;


political
and economic instability; and


the
higher cost of foreign service delivery. 

    While
eshare's and Open Market's expenses incurred in foreign countries typically are denominated in the local currencies, revenues generated by eshare's and Open Market's
international sales typically are paid in U.S. dollars, British pounds or Euros. While a significant portion of RoweCom's expenses in foreign countries are denominated in local currencies, a portion
of the expense for both its U.S. operations and its foreign countries is denominated in currencies other than the local currency. RoweCom enters into forward currency contracts primarily in European,
Australian and Canadian currencies to hedge its foreign currency exposures. However, RoweCom does not hedge all foreign currency exposure and existing forward currency contracts may not adequately
cover intended exchange gains and losses. We could experience fluctuations in currency exchange rates in the future that would have a material adverse impact on our international operations. 

Our growth in operations will likely be dependent upon the successful development of direct and indirect sales channels.  

    eshare and Open Market primarily sell their products domestically through a direct sales force and internationally through both direct and indirect sales
channels. eshare and Open Market support customers with internal technical and outsourced customer support staff. Our ability to achieve significant revenue growth in the future will greatly depend on
our ability to recruit and train sufficient technical and direct sales personnel and to outsource effectively our customer support functions. Each of eshare and Open Market has in the past experienced
difficulty in recruiting qualified sales and technical personnel. If we are unable to rapidly and 

effectively expand eshare's and Open Market's technical staff and direct sales force, our business and financial results could be hurt. 

    We
believe that our future growth will also depend on our ability to continue to develop and maintain eshare's and Open Market's indirect sales channels, including value added
resellers, or VARs, and distributors. Additionally, our investment of significant resources to develop these indirect channels could adversely affect our operating results if these efforts do not
generate sufficient additional revenues. 

    If
we are unable to recruit and retain qualified VARs and distributors, our results of operations could be adversely affected. Increased indirect sales also could adversely affect our
average selling prices and result in lower gross margins because lower unit prices are typically charged on sales made through indirect channels. Sales of eshare and Open Market products through
indirect channels will reduce our gross profits from our services because the VARs and distributors provide these services. 

    As
indirect sales increase, our direct contact with eshare's customer base will decrease, and we may have more difficulty accurately forecasting sales, evaluating customer
satisfaction and recognizing emerging customer requirements. In addition, VARs and distributors may develop, acquire or market products competitive with our products. Our strategy of marketing
products directly to customers and indirectly through VARs and distributors may result in distribution channel conflicts. Our direct sales efforts may compete with those of our indirect channels and,
to the extent different VARs and distributors target the same customers, VARs and distributors may also come into conflict with each other. Any channel conflicts that develop may have a material
adverse effect on our relationships with VARs and distributors or hurt our ability to attract new VARs and distributors. 

Risks Relating to Owning divine Common Stock  

If divine common stock is delisted from the Nasdaq National Market, the liquidity, visibility and price of divine common stock may
decrease.

    Since divine's initial public offering in July 2000, divine common stock has been listed on the Nasdaq National Market. Shares of divine common stock
could be delisted from the Nasdaq National Market if we fail to satisfy the continued listing requirements of the Nasdaq National Market, including the minimum bid price of $1.00. If divine common
stock is delisted from the Nasdaq National Market, we would be forced to list divine common stock on the OTC Bulletin Board or some other quotation medium, depending upon our ability to

meet the specific listing requirements of those quotation systems. If this happens, an investor might find it more difficult to buy and sell, or to obtain accurate price quotations for, shares of
divine common stock. This lack of visibility and liquidity could further decrease the price of divine common stock. In addition, delisting from the Nasdaq National Market might negatively impact our
reputation and, as a consequence, our business.

    The merger agreement for this merger and the eshare and Open Market mergers require divine to deliver shares of its common stock that have been authorized for listing on the Nasdaq
National Market as a condition to closing the applicable merger. If divine common stock is delisted from the Nasdaq National Market, each of RoweCom, eshare and Open Market can (1) terminate
its respective merger agreement with divine or (2) continue with its respective merger, with holders of common stock of RoweCom, eshare or Open Market, as

applicable, receiving shares of divine common stock that may have diminished liquidity and visibility.

The market price of divine common stock may continue to be volatile, which could cause litigation against us and prevent you from reselling your shares at or
above the price at which you acquire them in the merger.  

    From divine's initial public offering in July 2000 through the date of this proxy statement/ prospectus, the price per share of divine common stock has
ranged from a high of $12.44 to a low of $0.79. The market price of divine common stock has been, and is likely to continue to be, highly volatile and subject to wide fluctuations due to various
factors, many of which are beyond our control, including:


quarterly
variations in operating results;


volatility
in the stock market;


volatility
in the general economy;


changes
in interest rates;


announcements
of acquisitions, technological innovations or new software, services or products by us or our competitors; and


changes
in financial estimates and recommendations by securities analysts. 

In
addition, there have been large fluctuations in the prices and trading volumes of securities of many technology, Internet and CIM product and related professional service companies. Broad market
and industry factors may decrease the market price of our common stock. As a result, you may be unable to resell your shares of divine common stock that you receive in the merger at or above the
prices at which you acquired them. In the past, volatility in the market price of a company's securities has often led to securities class action litigation. Such litigation could result in
substantial costs to us and divert our attention and resources, which could harm our business. Declines in the market price of divine common stock or failure of the market price to increase could also
harm our ability to retain key employees, our access to capital and other aspects of our business. 

Our stockholders' rights plan and provisions in our certificate of incorporation, our bylaws and Delaware law could delay or deter tender offers or takeover
attempts that may offer you a premium for your common stock, which could adversely affect our stock price.  

    Our stockholders' rights plan and provisions in our certificate of incorporation, our bylaws and Delaware law could make it more difficult for a third party to
acquire control of us, even if the change in control would be beneficial to you. These impediments include: 


the
rights issued in connection with the stockholders' rights plan that will substantially dilute the ownership of any person or group that acquires 15% or
more of our common stock unless the rights are first cancelled or redeemed by our board of directors, in its discretion;


the
classification of our board of directors into three classes serving staggered three-year terms;


the
ability of our board of directors to issue shares of preferred stock with rights as it deems appropriate without stockholder approval; 


a
requirement that special meetings of our stockholders may be called only by our chairman, president or a majority of our board of directors;


a
prohibition against action by written consent of our stockholders;


a
requirement that our stockholders comply with advance notice provisions to bring director nominations or other matters before meetings of our
stockholders; and


the
adoption of a provision of Delaware law that prohibits us from entering into some business combinations with interested stockholders without the
approval of our board of directors. 

The
existence of the stockholders' rights plan and these provisions may deprive you of an opportunity to sell your shares at a premium over prevailing prices. The potential inability of our
stockholders to obtain a control premium could adversely affect the market price of our common stock. 

Our stock price may decline if a large number of shares are sold or there is a perception that these sales may occur.  

    The market price of our stock could decline as a result of additional sales of common stock, or the perception that these sales could occur. As of
August 31, 2001, there was an aggregate of 137,468,965 shares of restricted divine common stock that could be resold only through registration under the Securities Act or under an available
exemption from registration, including the exemption provided by Rule 144. As of August 31, 2001, of those shares, 109,920,104 were eligible for sale subject to the volume, manner of
sale and other limitations of Rule 144; 13,800,000 shares will be registered for resale pursuant to a registration statement on Form S-3 that divine has filed in connection
with the Emicom transaction (which

registration statement also covers 3,596,007 shares issued on September 7, 2001 in the Parlano transaction); and the remaining 13,748,861 shares will become eligible for sale between
August 31, 2001 and August 2002, subject to certain lock-up agreements described below.

The market price of divine common stock could decline as a result of the large number of shares that will become eligible for sale upon consummation of this
merger and the eshare and Open Market mergers.  

    Based upon 13,552,745 shares of RoweCom common stock issued and outstanding on September 10, 2001 and the 0.75 exchange ratio, divine will issue
approximately 10,164,558 shares of divine common stock upon consummation of the merger. Based upon 21,934,486 eshare common shares issued and outstanding and an eshare exchange ratio of 2.935 on
September 10, 2001, divine will issue approximately 64,377,716 shares of divine common stock upon consummation of the eshare merger. In addition, divine will issue 44,454,961 shares of
divine common stock upon consummation of the Open Market merger. Based on the foregoing assumptions, an aggregate of approximately 76,511,384 shares of divine common stock issued in this merger and
the eshare and Open Market mergers will be eligible for sale in the public market without restriction under the Securities Act, and an aggregate of approximately 42,485,791 shares of divine common
stock issued in this merger and the eshare and Open Market mergers to affiliates of RoweCom, eshare or Open Market will be eligible for sale subject to the volume, manner of sale and other limitations
of Rule 145 or Rule 144

under the Securities Act. The market price of divine common stock could decline as a result of these sales or the perception that these sales could occur. 

    Aleksander Szlam, the chairman and chief executive officer of eshare, and Szlam Partners have agreed with divine that, for a period of one year from the date of the closing of the
eshare merger, they will not offer to sell, contract to sell, or otherwise sell, dispose of, loan, pledge or grant any rights with respect to the significant number of shares of divine common stock
(approximately 32,700,000 as of September 10, 2001) they will receive in connection with the eshare merger, other than their right to sell shares directly to divine pursuant to the terms of
their stockholder agreement with divine. Similarly, in connection with divine's acquisition of Emicom Group, Inc. on July 18, 2001, certain of the founders of Emicom have agreed that
they will not offer to sell, contract to sell, or otherwise sell, dispose of, loan, pledge or grant any rights with respect to the 6,179,104 shares of divine common stock they received in that
transaction until July 18, 2002. Further, in connection with divine's acquisition from UBS AG of a 21% equity interest in Parlano, Inc., UBS has agreed that for a period beginning on
September 7, 2001 and ending one year after the effective date of the registration statement registering the 3,596,007 divine shares issued to UBS in that transaction, UBS will not transfer

more than 15% of the shares during any three-month period. An early waiver of these lock-up agreements by us could permit sales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock and
could adversely affect the trading price of our common stock.

THE ROWECOM SPECIAL MEETING    

General  

    This proxy statement/prospectus is being mailed on or about September   , 2001 to holders of record of RoweCom common stock as of the
close of business on September 4, 2001, and constitutes notice of the RoweCom special meeting in conformity with the requirements of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware. It is
accompanied by a proxy card furnished in connection with the solicitation of proxies by the RoweCom board for use at the special meeting and at any adjournments or postponements of the special
meeting. The special meeting will be held on October   , 2001, at 10:00 a.m. local time at RoweCom's corporate offices at 15 Southwest Park, Westwood, Massachusetts.

Matters to be Considered at the RoweCom Special Meeting  

    The purpose of the special meeting of RoweCom's stockholders is to consider and vote upon a proposal to approve and adopt the merger agreement and the merger.
Holders of RoweCom common stock may also consider and vote upon such other matters as may be properly brought before the RoweCom special meeting, including any adjournment or postponement of the
special meeting. The merger cannot occur unless the holders of a majority of RoweCom's outstanding common stock as of the record date vote in favor of the proposal to approve and adopt the merger
agreement and the merger. 

The RoweCom board of directors unanimously approved the merger agreement and the merger, and recommends a vote FOR adoption and approval of the merger
agreement and the merger.

Record Date and Outstanding Shares  

    Only holders of record of RoweCom common stock at the close of business on the record date, September 4, 2001, are entitled to notice of, and to vote
at, the special meeting. At the close of business on the record date, there were 12,952,745 shares of RoweCom common stock outstanding held by approximately 116 holders of record. Each
holder of record of RoweCom common stock on the record date will be entitled to one vote for each share held on all matters to be voted upon at the special meeting. As of the record date, RoweCom's
directors and executive officers and their affiliates held approximately 15% of the outstanding shares of RoweCom common stock. These directors and executive officers have indicated their intention to
vote, or cause to be voted, the shares beneficially owned by them in favor of the approval and adoption of the merger agreement and the merger.

Quorum; Required Votes; Abstentions and Broker Non-Votes  

    The presence, in person or by proxy, of the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of RoweCom common stock entitled to vote at the special meeting is
necessary to constitute a quorum. Abstentions and broker non-votes, which are executed proxies returned by a broker holding shares in street name that indicate that the broker has not
received voting instructions from the beneficial owner of the shares and does not have discretionary authority to vote the shares with respect to the approval and adoption of the merger agreement and
the merger, will be counted for purposes of determining whether a quorum exists. 

    Adoption and approval of the merger agreement and the merger requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the shares of RoweCom common stock outstanding as of the record date. All
properly executed proxies delivered and not properly revoked will be voted at the special meeting as specified in such proxies. If you do not specify a choice, your shares represented by a signed
proxy will be voted "FOR" the adoption and approval of the merger agreement and the merger. The failure to submit a vote by proxy card, by telephone, over the Internet or in person at the special
meeting, an abstention and broker non-votes will have the same effect as a vote "AGAINST" the adoption and approval of the merger agreement and the merger. 

Proxies; Solicitation of Proxies  

    To vote by proxy, you should complete your proxy card and mail it in the enclosed postage prepaid envelope. Alternatively, you may vote by telephone or over
the Internet. If you vote by telephone or over the Internet, you must do so by 12:00 p.m. Eastern time on October   , 2001, and you will be required to have the control
number appearing on your proxy card available in order to submit your vote. A properly completed telephone or Internet vote has the same effect as if you marked, signed and returned the proxy card by
mail. See the instructions on the proxy card for a description of the telephone and Internet voting procedures. We believe that the granting of proxies by telephone or the Internet is valid under
Delaware law. Please note that if you choose to vote over the Internet, you are responsible for any Internet access charges incurred.

    If
your shares are held in an account at a brokerage firm or bank, you must direct them on how to vote your shares. Your broker or bank will vote your shares only if you provide
directions on how to vote by following the instructions provided to you by your broker or bank. 

    RoweCom
does not expect that any matter other than approval and adoption of the merger agreement and the merger will be brought before the special meeting. If, however, other matters
are properly presented, the persons named as proxies will vote in accordance with their judgment with respect to those matters. 

    The
cost of the solicitation of proxies from holders of RoweCom common stock and all related costs will be borne by RoweCom. In addition, RoweCom may reimburse brokerage firms and
other persons representing beneficial owners of shares for their expenses in forwarding solicitation materials to such beneficial owners. Original solicitation of proxies by mail may be supplemented
by telephone, telecopy, e-mail or personal solicitation by directors, officers or other regular employees of RoweCom. No additional compensation will be paid to directors, officers or
other regular employees for these services. 

    RoweCom
has also retained MacKenzie Partners, Inc. to assist in the solicitation of proxies. RoweCom will pay MacKenzie Partners a fee of $6,500 and will reimburse MacKenzie Partners
for its reasonable out-of-pocket expenses. RoweCom has also agreed to indemnify MacKenzie Partners against certain liabilities arising out of its engagement. 

    You
should not send in any RoweCom stock certificates with your proxy card. The exchange agent will mail a transmittal letter to you containing instructions for the surrender of
RoweCom stock certificates as soon as practicable after completion of the merger. 

Revocability of Proxies  

    Any stockholder of record giving a proxy pursuant to this solicitation has the power to revoke and change their vote at any time prior to the special meeting
by: 


notifying
in writing RoweCom at 15 Southwest Park, Westwood, Massachusetts 02090 Attn: Investor Relations, that they would like to revoke their proxy;


submitting
another proxy with a later date by mail, telephone or over the Internet; or


appearing
in person and voting at the special meeting (merely attending the special meeting will not revoke your previously-granted proxy and change your
vote; you must cast a vote at the special meeting). 

If
your shares are held in the name of a bank, broker or other fiduciary, you may change your vote by submitting voting instructions to that person. 

THE MERGER    

General  

    This section of the proxy statement/prospectus describes material aspects of the proposed merger. While we believe that the description covers the material
terms of the merger, this summary may not contain all the information that is important to you. You should therefore carefully read this entire proxy statement/prospectus and the other documents we
refer to, including the merger agreement attached as Appendix A, and incorporate by reference for a more complete understanding of the merger. 

Background of the Merger  

    From time to time, the board of directors and various members of the senior management of RoweCom have discussed strategic alternatives available to RoweCom,
especially in light of RoweCom's cash flow and working capital needs. 

    RoweCom
and divine have no history of commercial relationships prior to the discussions that led to their agreement to merge. The first contact between the two companies occurred on
March 12, 2001. 

    On
March 12, 2001, Ron Bienvenu, president of divine's enterprise portal solutions business unit, placed a telephone call to Dr. Richard Rowe, RoweCom's chief executive
officer and chairman of the board, requesting a meeting to discuss ways in which divine and RoweCom might work together. They agreed to meet in Cambridge, Massachusetts on March 14, 2001. 

    On
March 14, 2001, Mr. Bienvenu and Ted Collins, president of divine applications, met with Dr. Rowe at the Harvard Faculty Club in Cambridge, Massachusetts.
Mr. Bienvenu spoke about divine's business strategy and indicated that divine had an interest in acquiring RoweCom as a part of its business strategy. Dr. Rowe indicated that RoweCom was
not seeking a buyer and that he believed there would be very little interest on the part of RoweCom's board of directors for a sale, but that divine was free to express its interest more concretely if
it wished. 

    On
April 3, 2001, Mr. Bienvenu called Dr. Rowe and indicated that divine's chief executive officer and chairman of the board, Andrew Filipowski, would be in the
Boston area on April 20, 2001 and would like to meet with the management of RoweCom to discuss a purchase of RoweCom by divine. Dr. Rowe agreed to consider such a meeting, but made no
commitment. 

    On
April 18, 2001, RoweCom's board of directors met. The meeting included a discussion with representatives of Chatsworth Securities, RoweCom's investment bankers, about the
status of obtaining additional equity financing or long-term loans for RoweCom to help it satisfy its need for working capital. Dr. Rowe presented divine's interest in acquiring
RoweCom. The consensus of the board was that management should meet with Mr. Filipowski and report back to the board the results of that meeting. 

    On April 20, 2001, Mr. Bienvenu, Kevin Dahill, vice president of finance for divine's enterprise portal solutions business unit, and Mr. Filipowski visited
RoweCom headquarters in Westwood, Massachusetts and met with Dr. Rowe, James Krzywicki, RoweCom's chief operating officer, Charles Germain, RoweCom's president of Europe, Asia-Pacific and Latin

America operations, Rodney Smith, RoweCom's chief financial officer, Lee Gerkin and Albert Vasquez, representing Chatsworth Securities, and Philip Villers, a member of RoweCom's board of directors.
Mr. Filipowski presented to the group divine's business strategy and organization structure and indicated divine's interest in acquiring RoweCom in a stock-for-stock
merger. At the end of the meeting, Dr. Rowe indicated RoweCom would consider divine's interest and respond within a reasonable period of time.

    On
April 20, 2001, after the meeting with divine, RoweCom's board of directors held a teleconference with Messrs. Krzywicki, Germain, Gerkin and Vasquez and Ian Best,
RoweCom's vice president and chief technical officer, to discuss the divine meeting. It was
agreed that more information should be gathered about divine and the board would meet by conference call on April 24, 2001. 

    On
April 24, 2001, RoweCom's board of directors held a conference call and, after discussion, agreed that RoweCom's management should proceed with divine to explore the
possibility of a merger.

required to complete a merger with divine. 

    On
April 27, 2001, Dr. Rowe, Messrs. Bienvenu and Dahill and Alex Walker, divine's senior vice president for mergers and acquisitions, held a conference call
during which it was agreed that divine would begin its due diligence investigation at RoweCom's headquarters. 

    On
May 4, 2001, Dr. Rowe had a telephone call with Mr. Walker for the purpose of updating each other on the status of due diligence and arranged to have a
face-to-face meeting on May 9, 2001 for the purpose of negotiating as many specifics concerning the merger as possible. 

    On
May 9, 2001, a meeting was held in Boston, Massachusetts to discuss possible terms for the merger. Messrs. Spellman, Bienvenu and Dahill represented divine. The
RoweCom executive team included Dr. Rowe and Messrs. Krzywicki, Germain and Smith. Chatsworth Securities was represented by Messrs. Gerkin and Vasquez. divine and RoweCom signed a
mutual non-disclosure agreement. The group discussed various terms and conditions that might be included in a merger agreement. At the end of the meeting, an agreement was reached in
principle for Dr. Rowe to approach RoweCom's board of directors to seek its approval to enter into exploratory discussions with divine along the general lines discussed at the April 24,
2001 board meeting. 

    On
May 11, 2001, RoweCom's board of directors held a meeting to discuss the basic terms and conditions that had been previously discussed by divine and RoweCom. Also present at
this meeting was Brian Keeler of Bingham Dana LLP, outside legal counsel to RoweCom. It was understood that, at that time, the terms required the approval of divine's board of directors as well
as RoweCom's board of directors. 

    On
May 16-17, 2001, Dr. Rowe and Mr. Krzywicki traveled to Chicago to meet with divine's management team. There was an informal gathering at dinner on
the evening of May 16, 2001, including Messrs. Filipowski, Walker, Bienvenu and Dahill and Buster Brown, divine's executive vice president for sales. This was followed by a presentation
by Dr. Rowe and Mr. Krzywicki to divine's leadership team, including Messrs. Filipowski, Walker, Bienvenu 

and Dahill, Paul Humenansky, divine's president and chief operating officer, and Michael Cullinane, divine's executive vice president and chief financial officer. Messrs. Gerkin and Vasquez
joined the group for the presentation. The RoweCom team then met with Mr. Walker to complete negotiations on the basic terms of the deal. It was at that meeting that the ratio of 0.75 RoweCom
shares to 1.00 divine shares was agreed upon. 

    On
May 18, 2001, RoweCom's board of directors held a conference call at which the basic terms of the agreement were presented and approved. Messrs. Gerkin and Vasquez
presented the results of their due diligence on divine. RoweCom's board asked Chatsworth Securities to conduct some additional due diligence on divine. After the meeting, a non-binding
letter of intent was signed that included all of the basic terms of the deal, with a binding no-shop agreement in place until May 31, 2001. 

    On
May 22, 2001, the divine board of directors held a conference call to discuss the RoweCom transaction. During this call, Mr. Filipowski and Jude Sullivan, divine's
general counsel, noted that a non-binding letter of intent with RoweCom had been executed, and that it was likely the execution of the letter of intent would be disclosed prior to execution of a
definitive merger agreement. 

    On
May 23, 2001, at divine's request and with approval of RoweCom's board of directors, after consultation with Mr. Keeler, RoweCom signed an amendment to the letter of
intent that extended the no-shop agreement to June 7, 2001. 

    On

May 31, 2001, Mr. Filipowski informed RoweCom's management that divine's board of directors had approved the transaction in principle, subject to further due
diligence. 

    On
June 5, 2001, Messrs. Walker and Cullinane joined Dr. Rowe and Mr. Smith at the offices of Fleet Capital for a meeting with Al DeGemmis and William
Rurode, managing directors of the technology & communications group of Fleet Capital, to explore terms and conditions for a seasonal line of credit for RoweCom that would be underwritten by
divine. 

    On
June 6, 2001, RoweCom's board of directors and Messrs. Krzywicki, Germain, Best, Smith, Keeler, Gerkin and Vasquez met by teleconference and received the final report
by Chatsworth regarding its due diligence on divine. Chatsworth also delivered to the board its oral opinion that as of May 24, 2001, the consideration to be received by RoweCom's stockholders
in the merger was fair, from a financial point of view, to the RoweCom stockholders. In addition, there was extensive discussion of the merger, which included Dr. Rowe and Mr. Keeler
summarizing the terms of the merger, Mr. Keeler describing the directors' legal duties in connection with the merger, and Dr. Rowe and Mr. Keeler answering the questions posed by
the directors relating to the merger. Based on Chatsworth's report, the discussion of the merger and the board's overall satisfaction with the terms of the merger, the 

board of directors formally approved the transaction and instructed management to proceed to a definitive agreement. 

    On
June 8, 2001, RoweCom's board of directors met by teleconference and agreed to extend the no-shop agreement in the letter of intent to June 13, 2001.

Wiley & Sons, and Harcourt/Academic Press. Mr. Keeler participated in this meeting via teleconference. Mr. Filipowski presented to the suppliers divine's business strategy and
RoweCom's important role in that strategy. He expressed his commitment to support RoweCom financially and presented the possibility that the suppliers might be able to convert their loans to divine
equity in connection with divine's proposed acquisition of RoweCom. 

    Also
on June 13, 2001, the RoweCom board of directors and Messrs. Krzywicki, Best, Smith, Keeler, Gerkin and Vasquez met by teleconference. There was extensive

Mr. Sullivan, received an update on the negotiations from Messrs. Walker and Sullivan and received management's recommendation that the board approve the terms of the merger. At the
conclusion of this meeting, the board formally approved the transaction. 

    On
June 28, 2001, Dr. Rowe and Mr. Filipowski had further discussions regarding the business strategy and structure of divine and the role of RoweCom in the
organization post-merger. 

    On
June 29, 2001, Dr. Rowe updated the RoweCom board of directors on the status of the negotiations with divine. 

    On

agreement. 

    On
July 6, 2001, Chatsworth delivered its written opinion to RoweCom's board of directors that as of July 6, 2001, the consideration to be received by RoweCom's
stockholders in the merger was fair, from a financial point of view, to RoweCom's stockholders. On the same day, RoweCom and divine executed the merger agreement. divine and RoweCom jointly announced
the proposed merger at the open of business on July 9, 2001. 

Reasons for the Merger  

    Joint Reasons for the Merger.
  The boards of directors of divine and RoweCom independently concluded that they expect
that the proposed merger will: 


afford
to each company the complementary strengths of the two individual companies;


provide
the combined company significant potential advantages and resources; and 


enable
the combined company to address emerging strategic opportunities more quickly and effectively. 

divine and RoweCom have each identified additional reasons for the merger, as discussed below. It should be noted, however, that the potential benefits of the merger may not be fully realized, if at
all. See "Risk Factors" beginning on page 25.

    divine's Reasons for the Merger.
  In addition to the anticipated joint benefits described above, divine believes that
RoweCom's knowledge resources and client base are compatible with divine's enterprise Web solutions business strategy. divine also believes that the combination of RoweCom's content and service
offerings and procurement technology with divine's software applications and sales and marketing infrastructure will enable the combined company to further its strategy of providing professional
services, Web-based technology, premier knowledge resources and managed applications that help global enterprises conveniently and cost-effectively manage information resources
and engage their constituencies. In addition, divine anticipates that the acquisition of RoweCom will expand divine's international presence, which can provide the combined business significant growth
opportunities. 

    RoweCom's Reasons for the Merger.
  In addition to the anticipated joint benefits described above, in reaching its
decision to approve and adopt the merger agreement and the merger and to recommend that the stockholders of RoweCom vote to approve and adopt the merger agreement and the merger, the RoweCom board of
directors considered a wide variety of information and factors, including the following: 


the
belief that divine's combination of professional services, Web-based technology and managed applications can further RoweCom's strategic
vision of creating a comprehensive e-media news, information and services environment for managing knowledge resources across the enterprise that provides a strong reason for frequent
visits to RoweCom's kStore;


the
opportunity for RoweCom to add various new corporate clients to its current client base, representing an increase in new business end-users
without some of the costs associated with growth via sales efforts;


the
belief that the custom nature and quality of divine's products and services will enhance RoweCom's ability to provide its clients with improved
personalized knowledge products;


the
anticipation that divine and RoweCom's complementary nature, as well as the diverse nature of their geographic markets, clients and service offerings,
can improve the stability and business potential of the companies' combined businesses;


the
merger will increase RoweCom's sales force with the addition of divine's solutions-focused sales and marketing team;


the
reasonableness of the terms and conditions of the merger agreement, including the restrictions on solicitation of alternative acquisition proposals
pending completion of the merger, termination fees and reimbursement of expenses to be paid by divine or RoweCom in the event of the termination of the merger agreement for specified reasons; 


the
current and historical market valuations of RoweCom and divine;


the
analysis presented by Chatsworth Securities and the oral opinion of Chatsworth Securities delivered on June 6, 2001, which was subsequently
confirmed and updated in writing on July 6, 2001 and is described in "Fairness Opinion of Chatsworth Securities LLC," that, based upon and subject to the matters described therein,
the consideration is fair to RoweCom stockholders from a financial point of view;


the
expectation that the merger will be treated as a tax-free reorganization under the Internal Revenue Code;


the
presentations by RoweCom's management and outside legal counsel;


the
risks associated with RoweCom remaining a stand-alone company; and


holding
shares in a larger and financially stronger enterprise should enable RoweCom stockholders to have greater liquidity in their holdings and provide
them the opportunities to participate in the potential growth of the combined businesses. 

    In
considering the proposed merger, the RoweCom board of directors also identified and considered various risks associated with the merger, including: 


the
potential effect that the public announcement of the merger would have on the market price of RoweCom common stock;


the
fixed nature of the exchange ratio and the resulting risk that, should there be a significant increase in the market value of RoweCom's common stock or
decrease in the market value of divine's common stock, the value of the consideration to be received by RoweCom's stockholders would be decreased;


the
possibility that the potential benefits set forth above may not be realized;


the
risk that RoweCom's products and services would not be successfully integrated in accordance with the projected timetable, and the risk that other
benefits of the merger would not be achieved;


the
risk that RoweCom's employees, especially its key management staff, would not be successfully integrated, which could reduce the value of the
acquisition;


the
substantial costs of integrating the business of divine and RoweCom and the transaction expenses arising from the merger;


certain
other risks applicable to the merger and the business of the combined company as set forth under "Risk Factors" beginning on page 25; and


the
possibility that the merger might not be consummated, resulting in a potential adverse effect on the market price of RoweCom's common stock. 

    The
RoweCom board of directors was also made aware of the negotiations between divine and each of Dr. Rowe and Messrs. Kryzwicki, Germain, Best and Smith concerning
their new employment agreements with RoweCom to be effective upon completion of the merger. Although the RoweCom board members, other than Dr. Rowe on his own behalf, did not participate in
these negotiations, the RoweCom board approved the final forms of these employment agreements. See "Agreements Related to the MergerEmployment Agreements." In considering the proposed
merger, the directors of RoweCom were aware of 

these and other interests of certain officers and directors in the merger described under "Interests of Certain Persons in the Merger" beginning on page 62.

    The
foregoing discussion of the information and factors considered by the RoweCom board of directors is not intended to be exhaustive, but is intended to include the material
information and factors considered by the RoweCom board of directors in connection with its review of the proposed merger. In view of the complexity and variety of factors considered in evaluating the
merger, the RoweCom board of directors did not consider it practical to, and did not, quantify or otherwise attempt to assign any relative or specific weights to the specific factors
considered, and individual directors may have given differing weights to different factors. Rather, the RoweCom board of directors viewed its position and recommendations as being based on the
totality of information presented to, and considered by, the RoweCom board. 

    In
light of all the factors set forth above, the RoweCom board unanimously approved and adopted the merger agreement and the merger. In evaluating the merger, the RoweCom board
concluded, and continues to believe, that the prospects for company growth and the realization of stockholder value would be maximized by entering into the merger agreement with divine. As a result,
the RoweCom board of directors recommends that the stockholders of RoweCom vote 
FOR
 approval and adoption of the merger agreement and the merger. 

Fairness Opinion of Chatsworth Securities LLC  

    Chatsworth Securities LLC is an investment banking firm that underwrites equity offerings, acts as an agent for private equity placements and provides
financial advisory services in connection with mergers and acquisitions. Chatsworth acted as financial advisor to RoweCom for the merger. Chatsworth was also engaged by the RoweCom board of directors
to render an opinion with respect to the fairness, from a financial point of view, of the consideration to be paid by divine to RoweCom's stockholders in the proposed merger. 

    On
June 6, 2001, Chatsworth rendered its oral opinion to the RoweCom board of directors that as of May 24, 2001, which was the date that the letter of intent entered
into between divine and RoweCom regarding the proposed terms of the merger was publicly announced, the consideration to be received by RoweCom's stockholders in the proposed merger was fair, from a
financial point of view, to the RoweCom stockholders. Chatsworth also delivered to the RoweCom board on July 6, 2001 its written opinion, dated July 6, 2001, that as of July 6,
2001 the consideration to be received by RoweCom's stockholders in the proposed merger was fair, from a financial point of view, to the RoweCom stockholders. The full text of Chatsworth's written
opinion, dated July 6, 2001, is attached as Appendix B to this proxy statement/prospectus and is incorporated by reference in this proxy statement/prospectus. You should read the
attached opinion for a discussion of assumptions made, matters considered and limitations on the review undertaken by Chatsworth in rendering its written opinion. The following is a summary of the
written opinion and the methodology that Chatsworth used to render its fairness opinion. 

    The
opinion was provided for the information and assistance of the RoweCom board of directors in connection with its consideration of the proposed merger. The opinion is not intended
to be, and does not constitute, a recommendation to you as to how you should vote on the proposed merger. The opinion was provided to the RoweCom board of directors for its use and benefit. The
opinion did not address RoweCom's underlying business decision to 

effect the merger and did not constitute a recommendation to the RoweCom board of directors in connection with the merger. 

    Although
Chatsworth Securities evaluated the fairness, from a financial point of view, of the consideration to be received by the stockholders of RoweCom in the merger, the form of
consideration and the exchange ratio itself were determined by divine and RoweCom through arm's-length negotiations. The RoweCom board of directors did not provide specific instructions to, or place
any limitations on, Chatsworth with respect to the procedures to be followed or factors to be considered by it in performing its analyses or providing its opinion. 

    For
purposes of its opinion, Chatsworth: 


reviewed
a draft of the merger agreement dated July 6, 2001;


reviewed
RoweCom's Annual Report to Stockholders and Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2000, Quarterly
Report on Form 10-Q for the quarterly period ended March 31, 2001, Registration Statement on Form S-8 filed with the SEC on January 9, 2001 for the
registration of shares of RoweCom common stock issuable in connection with RoweCom's 1998 Amended and Restated Stock Incentive Plan and press release announcing its first quarter of 2001 earnings;


reviewed
certain operating and financial information, including projections for the three years ended December 31, 2003, provided to Chatsworth by
RoweCom's management relating to RoweCom's business and prospects;


reviewed
certain estimates of cost savings and other combination benefits expected to result from the merger, which were prepared and provided to
Chatsworth by RoweCom's management;


met
with certain members of RoweCom's senior management to discuss RoweCom's business, operation, historical and projected financial results and future
prospects;


reviewed
divine's Annual Report to Stockholders and Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2000, Quarterly
Report on Form 10-Q for the quarterly period ended March 31, 2001, Current Reports on Form 8-K filed with the SEC since December 31, 2000 and press
release announcing its first quarter of 2001 earnings;


met
with certain members of divine's senior management to discuss divine's business operations, historical and projected financial results and future
prospects;


reviewed
the historical prices, trading multiples and trading volumes of RoweCom's common stock and divine's common stock;


reviewed
the terms of recent acquisitions that Chatsworth deemed generally comparable to the merger; and


conducted
such other studies, analyses, inquiries and investigations as Chatsworth deemed appropriate. 

    In
preparing its opinion, Chatsworth relied upon and assumed, without independent verification, the accuracy and completeness of the financial and other information, including,
without limitation, the projections and synergy estimates provided to Chatsworth by RoweCom. With respect to RoweCom's projected financial results and the potential synergies that could be achieved
upon consummation of the merger, Chatsworth assumed that they 

have been reasonably prepared on bases reflecting the best currently available estimates and judgments of the senior management of RoweCom as to the expected future performance of RoweCom. Chatsworth
did not assume any responsibility for the independent verification of any such information or of the projections and the synergy estimates provided to Chatsworth, and relied upon the assurances of the
senior management of RoweCom that it was unaware of any facts that would make such information, projections or synergy estimates incomplete or misleading. 

    In
arriving at its opinion, Chatsworth did not perform or obtain any independent appraisal of the assets or liabilities (contingent or otherwise) of RoweCom or divine, nor was it
furnished with any such appraisals. In rendering its opinion, RoweCom did not solicit, and was not authorized to solicit, third party acquisition interest in RoweCom. In addition, Chatsworth did not
express any opinion as to the price or range of prices at which RoweCom common stock or divine common stock may trade subsequent to the announcement or consummation of the merger. Chatsworth's opinion
was necessarily based on economic, market and other conditions and the information made available to RoweCom, as of the date of its opinion. Chatsworth assumed no responsibility for updating or
revising its opinion based on circumstances or events occurring after that date. 

    In
performing its analysis, Chatsworth made numerous assumptions with respect to industry performance, general business, economic, market and financial conditions and other matters,
many of which are beyond the control of Chatsworth, RoweCom and divine. Any estimates contained in the analysis performed by Chatsworth are not necessarily indicative of actual values or future
results, which may be significantly more or less favorable than suggested by this analysis. Additionally, estimates of the value of businesses or securities do not purport to be appraisals or to
reflect the prices at which such businesses or securities may actually be sold. Accordingly, these analyses and estimates are inherently subject to substantial uncertainty. As described above,
Chatsworth's opinion was among several factors considered by the RoweCom board of directors in making its determination to approve the merger agreement and the merger and recommend that RoweCom's
stockholders approve and adopt the merger agreement and the merger. 

    The
following summary includes information relied upon by Chatsworth in its preparation of the fairness opinion for the RoweCom board of directors. Certain of the analyses include
information presented in tabular format. In order to fully understand the financial analyses used, the tables must be read together with the text of each summary. The tables alone do not constitute a

    RoweCom
has incurred operating losses and net losses for the past three fiscal years. For fiscal year 2000, RoweCom's operating loss was $66.17 million and its net loss was
$83.98 million. For the first quarter of 2001, RoweCom incurred an operating loss of $3.74 million and a net loss of $5.57 million. As of March 31, 2001, RoweCom's
stockholders' deficit was $8.43 million and its book value per share was $(0.68). 

    The auditor's opinion given by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2000 financial statements of RoweCom included the following statement: "The
Company has suffered recurring losses from operations, has a working capital deficit and has a net capital deficiency that raise substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern." As
a consequence, the RoweCom board of directors believed that it would be necessary to obtain a commitment from a strategic investor or merger partner that would provide equity financing of at least
$10 million or equivalent financial support by June 2001. There was no assurance that additional capital would be available on reasonable terms, if at all, and additional equity investments
would create significant dilution for existing stockholders. In addition, RoweCom had to renew seasonal lines of credit in the United States and Europe totaling approximately $68 million.

    On
March 29, 2001, RoweCom received a letter from Nasdaq stating that "[t]he Company's common stock has failed to maintain a minimum bid price of $1.00
over the last 30 consecutive trading days as required by The Nasdaq National Market under Marketplace Rule 4450(a)(5) (the "Rule"). Therefore, in accordance with Marketplace
Rule 4310(c)(8)(B), the Company will be provided 90 calendar days, or until June 27, 2001 to regain compliance with this Rule However, if the Company is unable to
demonstrate compliance with the Rule on or before June 27, 2001, Staff will provide the Company with written notification that its securities will be delisted." If RoweCom's common stock were
delisted, it would be
detrimental to RoweCom's ability to raise equity financing. As of July 6, 2001, when RoweCom signed the merger agreement, RoweCom's common stock had failed to maintain a 

minimum bid price of $1.00 for 30 consecutive trading days and continued to trade on Nasdaq at prices below $1.00. See "Information About RoweComNasdaq National Market". 

    Given
RoweCom's financial condition and the need to raise debt and equity financing, Chatsworth believed that the terms and conditions of the merger agreement represented a fair offer
to RoweCom. 

Historical Ratio Analysis  

    Chatsworth reviewed the relationship between the daily closing prices of RoweCom common stock and divine common stock during the period from July 6,
2000 through July 6, 2001 by analyzing the implied historical ratios determined by dividing the price per share of RoweCom common stock by the price per share of divine common stock over such
period. Chatsworth noted that the implied ratio as of May 23, 2001, one day prior to the announcement of the signed letter of intent, was 0.48, and the average implied historical ratio for the
last three months prior to July 6, 2001, the date on which the merger agreement was signed, was 0.54 as compared to the negotiated exchange ratio for the merger of 0.75. 

Comparable Company Analysis  

    Chatsworth compared certain financial, trading and valuation information for RoweCom and divine to certain publicly available financial, trading and valuation
information. The valuation multiples are based on a peer group of seventeen wholesale distributors. Although the products being distributed by the peer group are different than RoweCom, the basic
distribution model is similar. RoweCom is an aggregator of subscription publications whose gross margin for the twelve months prior to March 31, 2001 of 8.8% is similar to the peer group
weighted average of 7.6% and median of 11.9% for the same period. 

    The
companies in the peer group are as follows:

    Pursuant to the terms of its engagement letter with Chatsworth, RoweCom has agreed to pay Chatsworth a total fee equivalent to at least $525,000. Of this amount, $60,000 was paid in

four equal monthly retainer fee payments from April through July 2001, $75,000 was paid upon delivery of Chatsworth's opinion to the RoweCom board of directors and, as described below, $390,000
will represent the minimum cash proceeds to be received by Chatsworth within 40 days of the consummation of the merger. In connection with the signing of the merger agreement, RoweCom issued
400,000 shares of unregistered RoweCom common stock to Chatsworth. The RoweCom common stock will convert into 300,000 registered shares of freely tradable divine common stock in the merger. Chatsworth
will sell the divine common stock during a period of one month from the date of the closing of the merger. If at the end of the one-month period, the aggregate net cash proceeds realized
by Chatsworth from the sale of the divine common stock is less than $390,000, then divine will pay to Chatsworth, within ten days from the end of the one-month period, an amount in cash
equal to the difference of the aggregate net cash proceeds of the divine common stock issued to Chatsworth and $390,000. RoweCom has agreed to reimburse Chatsworth for its reasonable
out-of-pocket expenses and to indemnify Chatsworth against certain liabilities, including certain liabilities under the federal securities laws.

    The preparation of a fairness opinion is a complex process and involves various judgments and determinations as to the most appropriate and relevant assumptions and financial analyses
and the application of these methods to the particular circumstances involved. The opinions are therefore not readily susceptible to partial analysis or summary description, and taking portions of the
analysis set out above, without considering the analysis as a whole, would, in the view of Chatsworth, create an incomplete and misleading picture of the processes underlying the analysis considered
in rendering its opinion. Chatsworth did not form a judgment as to whether any individual analysis or factor, positive or negative, considered in isolation, supported or failed to support its
opinion. In arriving at its opinion, Chatsworth considered the results of its separate analysis and did not attribute particular weight to any one analysis of factor. 

Accounting Treatment  

    divine will record the merger using the purchase method of accounting in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. This means that for
financial reporting purposes, divine will treat both companies as one company beginning as of the date we complete the merger. In addition, under this method of accounting, divine will record the fair
value of RoweCom's net assets on its consolidated financial statements, with the remaining purchase price in excess of the fair value of RoweCom's net assets recorded as goodwill. See "Unaudited Pro
Forma Condensed Combined Financial Statements" beginning on page 82.

Interests of Certain Persons in the Merger  

    In considering the recommendation of the RoweCom board of directors that RoweCom stockholders approve and adopt the merger agreement and the merger, you should
be aware that certain directors and executive officers of RoweCom have interests in the merger that are different from, or in addition to, your interests as stockholders of RoweCom. The RoweCom board
of directors was aware of these interests and considered them, among other matters, in approving and adopting the merger agreement and the merger. 

    Options, Bridge Notes and Warrants.
  All of the in-the-money options held by RoweCom's directors
and executive officers, whether or not vested, will convert into fully exercisable options to purchase shares of divine common stock upon completion of the merger. The number of divine shares
underlying the options and the exercise prices will be adjusted by the 0.75 exchange ratio as described under "The Merger AgreementTreatment of Outstanding Options." Based upon divine's
closing common stock price of $0.82 on September 10, 2001, RoweCom's directors and executive officers and their affiliates did not hold any in-the-money options as of
that date.

    In addition, Dr. Richard R. Rowe, RoweCom's chairman and chief executive officer, and Philippe Villers, a director of RoweCom, are among the holders of the bridge notes and the
related warrants to purchase RoweCom common stock. Dr. Rowe holds a total of $1,000,000 in aggregate principal amount of the bridge notes and 163,993 warrants; Mr. Villers directly and
indirectly holds a total of $1,435,000 in aggregate principal amount of the bridge notes and 235,330 warrants. If we complete the merger:


Dr. Rowe's
bridge notes will be exchanged for an equal aggregate principal amount of notes convertible into a number of shares of divine common
stock that will be based on an agreed upon conversion price that will be tied to the market price of divine

common
stock over a period of time. In addition, Dr. Rowe's RoweCom warrants will be exercisable for 122,994 shares of divine common stock at an expected exercise price of $6.67
per share for 75,000 of the warrants and $3.12 per share for 47,994 of the warrants; and


with
respect to Mr. Villers' bridge notes, $85,000 in aggregate principal amount of bridge notes will be repayed upon consummation of the merger and
the remaining $1,350,000 in aggregate principal of bridge notes will be exchanged for notes convertible into a number of shares of divine common stock that will be based on the agreed upon conversion
price. Mr. Villers' RoweCom warrants will be exercisable for 176,477 shares of divine common stock at an expected exercise price of $6.67 per share for 107,625 of the warrants and $3.12 per
share for 68,872 of the warrants.

Dr. Rowe and Mr. Villers are among the noteholders who have requested that (1) the exercise price of the exchanged warrants be decreased so that is is tied to the market price of
divine common stock and (2) they be issued additional divine warrants. See "The Merger AgreementTreatment of Outstanding Bridge Notes."

    Employment Agreements.
  Dr. Rowe, James Krzywicki and Charles Germain have executed employment agreements with
RoweCom that will become effective upon completion of the merger and which provide for severance payments equal to 12 months of their respective salaries and employee benefits if their
employment is terminated by RoweCom, without cause, or by the employee, for good reason. Rodney Smith and Ian Best have executed employment agreements with RoweCom that will also become effective upon
completion of the merger and which provide for severance payments equal to six months of their respective salaries and employee benefits if their employment is terminated by RoweCom, without cause, or
by the employee, for good reason. See "Agreements Related to the MergerEmployment Agreements." 

    Indemnification and Insurance.
  Upon completion of the merger, divine will fulfill and honor all of RoweCom's existing
obligations to indemnify the officers and directors of RoweCom and its subsidiaries. In addition, divine will indemnify RoweCom's officers and directors for acts or omissions in such capacity
occurring prior to the completion of the merger for a period of six years after July 6, 2001. Further, for six years after the effective time of the merger, RoweCom's certificate of
incorporation and bylaws will contain indemnification provisions as favorable to the officers and directors of RoweCom or its subsidiaries as the indemnification provisions in RoweCom's current
certificate of incorporation and bylaws. 

    Upon
completion of the merger, divine will extend RoweCom's existing directors' and officers' liability, errors and omissions, employment practices and fiduciary liability insurance
policies for six additional years. divine is not, however, required to spend more than a total of $700,000 for this additional insurance. 

    Name Rights.
  If at any time after the merger, we decide to discontinue active commercial use of the name "RoweCom," any
related terms using the root term "Rowe" or the domain name
"Rowe.com," we have agreed to notify Dr. Rowe or his heirs, legatees or assigns and, upon request, to assign the name or term to Dr. Rowe or his heirs, legatees or assigns without any
additional consideration. 

Stock Ownership Following the Merger  

    As of September 10, 2001, divine had 164,124,076 shares of common stock issued and outstanding. Based upon 13,552,745 shares of RoweCom common stock
issued and outstanding as of September 10, 2001 and the 0.75 exchange ratio, divine will issue an aggregate of approximately 10,164,558 shares of divine common stock to holders of RoweCom
common stock following the merger. Assuming that divine (1) completes its pending mergers with eshare and Open Market, (2) issues approximately 64,377,716 shares pursuant to the
eshare merger (based upon 21,934,486 eshare common shares issued and outstanding and an eshare exchange ratio of 2.935 as of September 10, 2001), (3) issues 44,454,961 shares
pursuant to the Open Market merger and (4) does not issue any other shares of divine common stock prior to the closing of this merger, the existing holders of these shares of RoweCom common
stock collectively will hold approximately 3.6% of divine common stock issued and outstanding after the merger.

Treatment of Outstanding Senior Secured Notes  

    In January 2001, RoweCom issued $9,000,000 in aggregate principal amount of floating rate senior secured notes to several suppliers. The notes are due on December 28, 2001, and
interest is payable upon maturity of the notes at a rate of prime plus 1%. RoweCom is currently in violation of several covenants in these notes. Accordingly, these notes are due on demand, if so
called by the suppliers that hold them. divine and the suppliers that hold these notes are negotiating the waiver of these defaults, the exchange of these notes upon consummation of the merger for
notes that are convertible into divine common stock and the terms and conditions of the convertible notes. divine expects that:


the
maturity date of these notes will be extended to April 30, 2002 with the holders having the option to demand partial repayment of outstanding
principal and accrued interest on December 28, 2001;


it
will guarantee repayment of the notes;


the
conversion price will be tied to the market price of divine common stock over some period of time; and


it
will agree to register with the SEC the public resale of the divine shares issuable upon conversion of these notes.

Regulatory Matters  

    Currently, neither divine nor RoweCom is required to file any information with the Federal Trade Commission or the Antitrust Division of the Department of
Justice under the provisions of the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended, in connection with the merger and the transactions contemplated by the merger
agreement. 

    We
are not aware of any other governmental approvals or actions that are required to complete the merger other than compliance with federal securities laws and Delaware corporate law.
Should any approval or action be required, we currently plan to seek the approval or take the necessary action. 

Dissenters' Rights  

    RoweCom stockholders are not entitled to appraisal rights under Delaware law in connection with the merger. 

Federal Securities Laws Consequences  

    The shares of divine common stock to be issued in connection with the merger will be registered under the Securities Act and will be freely transferable under
the Securities Act, except for shares of divine common stock issued to any person who is deemed to be an "affiliate" of RoweCom on the date of the special meeting or of divine following completion of
the merger. Persons who may be deemed to be affiliates include individuals or entities that control, are controlled by, or are under the common control of RoweCom or divine, as applicable, and may
include executive officers, directors and significant stockholders of RoweCom or divine, as applicable. Affiliates of RoweCom may not sell their shares of divine common stock acquired in connection
with the merger except pursuant to: 


an
effective registration statement under the Securities Act covering the resale of those shares;


Rule 145
(or, for RoweCom stockholders who become affiliates of divine, Rule 144) under the Securities Act; or


any
other applicable exemption under the Securities Act. 

    The merger agreement provides that RoweCom will use its reasonable efforts to obtain from each of its affiliates (for purposes of Rule 145 of the Securities Act) a written
agreement providing that the affiliate will not sell, pledge, transfer or otherwise dispose of any divine common stock issued to the affiliate pursuant to the merger, except in compliance with
Rule 145 or an exemption from the registration requirements of the Securities Act.

    divine's
registration statement of which this proxy statement/prospectus forms a part does not cover the resale of shares of divine common stock to be received by RoweCom affiliates
in the merger. 

Nasdaq National Market  

    divine has agreed to authorize for listing on the Nasdaq National Market the shares of divine common stock to be issued in connection with the merger, upon
official notice of issuance, before the completion of the merger. When we complete the merger, RoweCom common stock will be delisted from the Nasdaq National Market and deregistered under the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934.

Material United States Federal Income Tax Consequences  

    The following are the material federal income tax consequences of the merger that are generally applicable to holders of RoweCom common stock. This discussion
is based on the current provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, applicable U.S. Treasury Regulations, and current administrative rulings and court decisions, all of which are
subject to change. Any such change, which may or may not be retroactive, could alter the tax consequences to divine, RoweCom or the RoweCom stockholders as described below. 

    RoweCom stockholders should be aware that this discussion does not deal with all U.S. federal income tax considerations that may be relevant to particular RoweCom stockholders in
light of their particular circumstances, such as stockholders: 


that
are dealers in securities, banks or insurance companies;


that
are subject to the alternative minimum tax provisions of the tax code;


that
are not citizens or residents of the United States or that are foreign corporations, partnerships, estates or trusts;


that
are tax-exempt organizations;


that
acquired their shares in connection with stock option or stock purchase plans or in other compensatory transactions; or


that
hold their shares as a part of a hedging, straddle, conversion or other risk reduction transaction. 

    This
discussion of material federal income tax consequences is not a complete analysis or description of all potential federal income tax consequences of the merger. It does not
address tax consequences that may vary with, or are contingent on, individual circumstances. In addition, the discussion does not address any non-income tax consequences or any foreign,
state or local tax consequences, or the tax consequences of transactions effectuated prior to or after the merger, whether or not such transactions are in connection with the merger. 

We strongly urge each RoweCom stockholder to consult his, her or its own tax advisor to determine the particular federal, state or local or foreign income or
other tax consequences of the merger to him, her or it.  

    Neither divine nor RoweCom has requested or will request a ruling from the Internal Revenue Service regarding any of the U.S. federal income tax consequences
of the merger. As a condition to consummation of the merger, Bingham Dana LLP, counsel to RoweCom, will render an opinion to RoweCom that the merger will constitute a reorganization under
Section 368(a) of the Code. If RoweCom waives receipt of the tax opinion, the RoweCom stockholders will be notified and resolicited. The tax opinion will be subject to certain assumptions and
qualifications and will be based on the accuracy of certain representations of divine, Knowledge Resources Acquisition Corp. and RoweCom, including representations in certain certificates delivered to
counsel by divine, Knowledge Resources Acquisition Corp. and RoweCom. Moreover, the opinion will not be binding on the IRS or any court nor preclude the IRS or a court from adopting a contrary
position. The discussion below assumes that the merger will qualify as a reorganization.

    Federal Income Tax Treatment of divine, Knowledge Resources Acquisition Corp., and RoweCom.
  None of divine, Knowledge
Resources Acquisition Corp., or RoweCom will recognize any gain or loss for federal income tax purposes as a result of the merger. 

    Federal Income Tax Consequences to RoweCom Stockholders.
  Provided that the merger qualifies as a reorganization, and
subject to the assumptions, limitations and qualifications referred to herein: 


A
holder of RoweCom common stock who exchanges all of his, her or its RoweCom common stock solely for shares of divine common stock pursuant to the merger
will not recognize any taxable gain or loss upon the exchange.


Cash
payments received by RoweCom stockholders in lieu of a fractional share of divine common stock will be treated as if the fractional share had been
issued in the merger and then redeemed by divine. A RoweCom stockholder receiving a cash payment instead of a fractional share will generally recognize capital gain or loss upon the payment equal to
the difference, if any, between the stockholder's tax basis in the fractional share and the amount of cash received.


A
holder of RoweCom common stock will have a tax basis in the divine common stock received in the merger equal to (1) the tax basis of the RoweCom
common stock surrendered by that holder in the merger less (2) the tax basis allocable to any fractional share of divine common stock converted to cash as described above.


The
holding period for shares of divine common stock received in exchange for RoweCom common stock in the merger will include the holding period for the
RoweCom common stock exchanged in the merger, assuming the holder holds his, her or its RoweCom common stock as a capital asset at the time of the merger.

The preceding discussion is intended only as a summary of the material United States federal income tax consequences of the merger and does not purport to be a
complete analysis or discussion of all potential tax effects relevant thereto. You are urged to consult your own tax advisor as to the specific tax consequences to you of the merger, including tax
return reporting requirements, the applicability and effect of foreign, federal, state, local and other applicable tax laws and the effect of any proposed changes in tax laws.  

THE MERGER AGREEMENT    

General  

    The following is a summary of the material provisions of the merger agreement, a copy of which is attached as Appendix A to this proxy
statement/prospectus and is incorporated herein by reference. The following is not a complete statement of all provisions of the merger agreement. Statements made in this proxy statement/prospectus
with respect to the terms of the merger agreement are qualified in their entirety by reference to the more detailed information set forth in the merger agreement. 

The Merger  

    Following the approval and adoption of the merger agreement and the merger by RoweCom's stockholders and the satisfaction or waiver of the other conditions to
the merger, Knowledge Resources Acquisition Corp., a wholly-owned subsidiary of divine, will merge with and into RoweCom. As a result of the merger, Knowledge Resources Acquisition Corp. will cease to
exist, RoweCom will become a wholly-owned subsidiary of divine and the existing stockholders of RoweCom will become stockholders of divine. The merger will become effective upon the filing of a
certificate of merger with the Delaware Secretary of State or at any later time as may be specified in the certificate of merger. The filing of a certificate of merger will occur as soon as
practicable, but no later than two business days, after satisfaction or waiver of the conditions to complete the merger, unless divine and RoweCom agree otherwise. We cannot assure you, however, that
the conditions to the merger will be satisfied or waived or that the merger agreement will not be terminated. See "Conditions of the Merger" and "Termination."

    After
the merger: 


the
certificate of incorporation and bylaws of Knowledge Resources Acquisition Corp. will become the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of RoweCom;
and


the
officers and directors of Knowledge Resources Acquisition Corp. will become the officers and directors of RoweCom. 

Consideration to be Received in the Merger  

    Upon completion of the merger, each issued and outstanding share of RoweCom common stock will be exchanged for 0.75 of a share of divine common stock. 

Treatment of Outstanding Options  

    Upon completion of the merger, each outstanding option to purchase RoweCom common stock under RoweCom's stock incentive plans, other than options granted under
RoweCom's 1999 Non-Employee Director Plan, that has an exercise price that is less than or equal to the product obtained from multiplying (1) the closing price for a share of divine
common stock as reported on the Nasdaq National Market on the trading day immediately before the consummation of the merger by (2) the exchange ratio of 0.75, and is therefore
"in-the-money," will convert into a fully exercisable option to purchase, at an adjusted exercise price equal to the current exercise price divided by 0.75, a number of shares
of divine common stock equal to the number of RoweCom shares subject to the option multiplied by 0.75. divine will issue these options under its 1999 or 2001 Stock Incentive Plan, as 

determined by divine before completion of the merger. The shares of divine common stock issuable upon conversion of these options will be registered on a registration statement on
Form S-8 that divine has previously filed with the SEC. Based upon divine's closing common stock price of $0.82 on September 10, 2001, no RoweCom options were in-the-money as
of that date. Upon completion of the merger, RoweCom will send a notice to holders of all out-of-the-money options granted by RoweCom under its 1998 Amended and
Restated Stock Incentive Plan informing them that their options will be cancelled if not exercised within ten days after the merger's completion. RoweCom has agreed to use its commercially reasonable
efforts to enter into agreements for the termination of all other out-of-the money options and all options granted under its 1999 Non-Employee Director Plan. The
approval of the mailing

of the notice to optionholders by RoweCom's compensation committee and the termination of these other options are conditions to closing the merger.

Treatment of Outstanding Warrants  

    Upon completion of the merger and subject to the discussion under "Treatment of Outstanding Bridge Notes," all of the outstanding warrants to
purchase an aggregate of 1,370,056 shares of RoweCom common stock will convert into warrants to purchase shares of divine common stock. Except for the converted warrants to be held by HFTP Investment
L.L.C. and Leonardo, L.P., the exercise price of each converted warrant will be the exercise price of the original RoweCom warrant immediately prior to consummation of the merger divided by 0.75, and
exercise of the converted warrant will entitle the holder to the number of RoweCom shares subject to the original RoweCom warrant multiplied by 0.75. divine and HFTP Investment and Leonardo are
negotiating the exercise price and number of shares of divine common stock that will be issuable upon exercise of the converted warrants to be held by HFTP Investment and Leonardo upon consummation of
the merger. divine expects that the converted warrants to be held by HFTP Investment and Leonardo will be exercisable for an aggregate of 700,000 shares of divine common stock at an exercise price
based upon the closing price of divine common stock on the date prior to consummation of the merger. The remaining warrants will be exercisable for an aggregate of 859,542 shares of divine common
stock.

    divine
has agreed to file, promptly after completion of the merger, a registration statement with the SEC registering the public resale of the shares of divine common stock issuable
upon exercise of all the converted warrants. 

Treatment of Outstanding Bridge Notes  

    Pursuant to the terms of the $6,135,000 aggregate principal amount of outstanding RoweCom bridge notes, the holders of these bridge notes have demanded
repayment of the notes upon consummation of the merger. divine expects to repay approximately $475,000 in aggregate principal amount of these bridge notes upon consummation of the merger. As a
condition to completing the merger, the holders of the remaining $5,660,000 in aggregate principal amount of these bridge notes must agree to exchange these bridge notes for an equal principal amount
of notes that will be convertible into divine common stock at any time after 30 days after completion of the merger and before repayment of the convertible notes. In addition, all of the
noteholders must agree to exchange each outstanding RoweCom warrant issued in connection with the bridge notes for a warrant to purchase shares of divine common stock upon completion of the merger.
divine expects that the number of divine

shares underlying these warrants and the exercise price will be adjusted by the exchange ratio as described under "Treatment of Outstanding Warrants." The noteholders, however, have
requested that (1) the exercise price of the exchanged warrants be decreased so that it is tied to the market price of divine common stock and (2) they be issued additional divine warrants. The
warrants will expire ten years from the issuance date of the original RoweCom warrants. divine and the holders of these bridge notes are negotiating the terms of the convertible notes, including the
interest rate, maturity date, conversion price and security, but in any event the terms will be no less favorable to RoweCom than as follows:


an
annual interest rate of 6%;


a
maturity on the earlier of (1) December 31, 2002, (2) a liquidation, dissolution, sale of substantially all assets, or disposition
of more than 50% of the voting securities, of RoweCom, or (3) a default under the convertible notes;


divine's
guarantee of the repayment of the convertible notes; and


divine
will not make any cash distributions on its common stock without first receiving approval of 66

/

% of the outstanding aggregate
principal amount of convertible notes. 

    divine has agreed to file with the SEC within 60 days after completion of the merger a registration statement registering the public resale of the shares of divine common stock
issuable upon conversion of the convertible notes and exercise of the related warrants.

No Fractional Shares  

    divine will not issue fractional shares of divine common stock in the merger. Instead, any holder of RoweCom common stock that would otherwise be entitled to a
fraction of a divine share in the merger will be paid an amount in cash, without interest, equal to such fraction multiplied by the closing price of a share of divine common stock on the Nasdaq
National Market on the trading day immediately prior to the consummation of the merger. 

Procedures for Exchange of Certificates  

    As soon as practicable after the merger, the exchange agent will mail to each registered holder of RoweCom common stock (1) a letter of transmittal and
(2) instructions for surrendering RoweCom stock certificates in exchange for certificates representing shares of divine common stock and cash for any fractional shares. Upon surrendering a
RoweCom stock certificate along with a duly executed letter of transmittal and any other required documents to the exchange agent or divine, each RoweCom stockholder will be entitled to receive a
certificate representing the whole number of shares of divine common stock that such holder has the right to receive and cash for any fractional shares. 

    If
any RoweCom stock certificate has been lost, stolen or destroyed, divine may require the owner of such lost, stolen or destroyed RoweCom stock certificate to provide an appropriate
affidavit and to deliver a bond as indemnity against any claim that may be made against the exchange agent, divine or RoweCom with respect to such RoweCom stock certificate. 

You should not surrender your RoweCom stock certificates for exchange until you receive a letter of transmittal and instructions from the exchange
agent.

Representations and Warranties  

    The merger agreement contains customary representations and warranties by divine and RoweCom relating to, among other things: 


the
corporate organization, standing and power of divine and RoweCom;


the
capital structure of divine and RoweCom;


the

reasonable efforts consistent with past practices and policies to preserve substantially intact its business organization, to keep available the services of its officers and employees, and to preserve
its present relationships with customers and with other persons and entities with whom it has business relationships to the end that its goodwill and ongoing business will be unimpaired when we
consummate the merger. 

    RoweCom

and (2) that RoweCom was allowed to acquire the assets of MDLB Enterprises, L.L.C. (doing business as Doody Publishing), as described under "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial

lease, license, encumber or dispose of assets; 


incur
indebtedness other than in the ordinary course of business provided that the aggregate amount of indebtedness of RoweCom and its subsidiaries will

seasonal working capital revolving credit lines;


write

make
material changes in its accounting policies; or


make

    No Solicitation.
  RoweCom has agreed not to: 


directly
or indirectly solicit, initiate, encourage or take any action to facilitate any inquires or proposals that constitute, or could reasonably be
expected to lead to, any company acquisition proposal (as defined below); or


engage
in, or enter into, any negotiations or discussions concerning any company acquisition proposal. 

However,
in response to an unsolicited company acquisition proposal that did not result from a breach by RoweCom of its obligations not to solicit alternative transactions, and following delivery to
divine of notice of the company acquisition proposal, RoweCom may, to the extent that RoweCom's board of directors determines in good faith, after consultation with its outside counsel, that it would
be required to do so by its fiduciary duties, participate in discussions regarding any company acquisition proposal that is, or may lead to, a company superior proposal (as defined below) in order to
be informed and make a determination with respect to the proposal. 

    Company
acquisition proposal means any bona fide inquiry, proposal or offer relating to any of the following which would result in a third party, or its stockholders, acquiring more
than 20% of the voting power of RoweCom or the assets representing more than 20% of the net income, net revenue or net assets of RoweCom on a consolidated basis: 


merger,
consolidation, business combination, or similar transaction involving RoweCom or any subsidiary of RoweCom;


sale,
lease or other disposition, directly or indirectly, by merger, consolidation, share exchange or otherwise, of any assets of RoweCom or any subsidiary
of RoweCom in one or more transactions;


issuance,
sale, or other disposition of, including by way of merger, consolidation, share exchange or any similar transaction, securities, or options,
rights or warrants to purchase such securities, or securities convertible into such securities, of RoweCom or any subsidiary of RoweCom;


liquidation,
dissolution, recapitalization or other similar type of transaction with respect to RoweCom or any subsidiary of RoweCom;


tender
offer or exchange offer for RoweCom securities; 


transaction
that is similar in form, substance or purpose to any of the foregoing transactions; or


public
announcement of an agreement, proposal, plan or intention to do any of the foregoing. 

    Company
superior proposal means any unsolicited offer made by a third party to consummate a tender offer, exchange offer, merger, consolidation or similar transaction which would
result in the third party, or its stockholders, owning, directly or indirectly, more than 50% of RoweCom common stock then outstanding, or of the surviving entity in a merger, or all or substantially
all of the assets of RoweCom and its subsidiaries, taken together, on terms that the RoweCom board of directors determines in good faith, based on its consultation with a financial advisor of
nationally recognized reputation and considering any other matters that it deems relevant, would, if consummated, result in a transaction more favorable to RoweCom's stockholders from a financial
point of view than the merger and, taking into account, in the reasonable good faith judgment of the RoweCom board of directors after consultation with its financial advisor, the availability to the
third party making the company superior proposal of the financial means to conclude such transaction. 

    Other Covenants.
  The merger agreement contains certain other covenants and agreements, including agreements relating to
preparation and distribution of this proxy statement/prospectus, public announcements and cooperation regarding certain filings with
governmental and other agencies and organizations. In addition, the merger agreement contains a general covenant requiring each of the parties to use its commercially reasonable efforts to effectuate

Termination  

    Termination by Mutual Consent.
  RoweCom and divine may mutually terminate the merger agreement and abandon the merger at
any time prior to the effective time of the merger, before or after receiving the approval of the RoweCom stockholders. 

    Termination by either divine or RoweCom.
  Either divine or RoweCom may terminate the merger agreement and abandon the
merger if: 


the
merger has not been consummated on or before December 31, 2001;


any
applicable law or regulation or final and nonappealable judgment, injunction, order or decree that makes consummation of the merger illegal or
prohibits the closing of the merger;


the
other party has breached or failed to comply in any material respect with any of its obligations under the merger agreement, or any representation or
warranty made by the other party in the merger agreement is incorrect in any material respect, and such breach, failure, or misrepresentation is not cured within 20 business days of notice; or


the
requisite RoweCom stockholder approval has not been obtained at the special meeting. 

    As
discussed below under "Information Regarding RoweComLegal Proceedings," RoweCom has been named as a defendant in several securities class action lawsuits that have
been filed subsequent to the signing of the merger agreement. The lawsuits may be considered a material adverse charge to the financial condition of RoweCom that allows divine to terminate the merger
agreement and abandon the merger without paying a termination fee. However, on August 14, 2001, divine signed a waiver stating that it will not terminate the merger agreement or abandon the
merger as a result of two of the lawsuits that were filed. 

    Termination by divine.
  divine may terminate the merger agreement and abandon the merger at any time prior to the
completion of the merger, before or after the approval by RoweCom's stockholders, if: 


RoweCom
receives, or a third party publicly announces, a company acquisition proposal and either the special meeting does not occur and the merger is not
consummated by December 31, 2001, or the RoweCom stockholders do not approve and adopt the merger agreement and the merger;


the
RoweCom board of directors or any committee of the board withdraws or modifies in a manner adverse to divine its approval or recommendation of the
merger or the merger agreement;

connection with a third-party tender offer or exchange offer made to RoweCom, the board of directors of RoweCom takes any action other than a rejection
of the offer;


the
RoweCom board of directors or any committee of the board recommends any company acquisition proposal;


RoweCom
or any of its officers or directors enters into discussions, negotiations or an agreement in violation of the no solicitations provisions contained
in the merger agreement. See "Covenants and AgreementsNo Solicitation;"


RoweCom
consummates a company acquisition proposal or signs an agreement with respect to a company acquisition proposal;


RoweCom
has not executed the senior credit agreement and, in divine's reasonable judgment will not, before December 31, 2001, execute the senior
credit agreement; or


the
RoweCom board of directors resolves to do any of the foregoing. 

Termination Fee  

    Termination Fee Payable by RoweCom to divine.
  RoweCom will be required to pay divine a termination fee of $800,000 if: 


divine
or RoweCom terminates the merger agreement because RoweCom receives, or a third party publicly announces, a company acquisition proposal and either
the special meeting does not occur and the merger is not consummated by December 31, 2001, or the RoweCom stockholders do not approve and adopt the merger agreement and the merger; 


divine
terminates the agreement because RoweCom's board of directors or a committee of the board withdraws or modifies its approval or recommendation of
the merger;

offer;


divine
terminates the agreement because RoweCom's board of directors recommends a company acquisition proposal;


divine
terminates the agreement because RoweCom or any of its officers or directors enters into discussions, negotiations or an agreement in violation of
the no solicitation provisions of the merger agreement. See "Covenants and AgreementsNo Solicitation;" or

    Termination Fee Payable by divine to RoweCom.
  divine must pay RoweCom a termination fee of $1,200,000 and reimburse
RoweCom for expenses of up to $250,000 if divine terminates the merger agreement because RoweCom fails to execute the senior credit agreement before completion of the merger and, in divine's
reasonable judgment, RoweCom will not execute the senior credit agreement before December 31, 2001. 

Amendments  

    Subject to the applicable provisions of Delaware corporate law, at any time prior to consummation of the merger, divine and RoweCom, by resolution of their
respective board of directors, may modify or amend the merger agreement by written agreement executed and delivered by duly authorized officers of each company. The merger agreement provides, however,
that after approval of the merger by RoweCom's stockholders, no amendment that requires further stockholder approval can be made without approval of RoweCom's stockholders. 

Expenses  

    If we do not consummate the merger, each of divine and RoweCom will bear its own costs and expenses incurred in connection with the merger agreement and the
transactions contemplated thereby. If the merger is completed, divine will pay for these costs and expenses.

UNAUDITED PRO FORMA CONDENSED COMBINED
  FINANCIAL STATEMENTS    

    The following unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements describe the pro forma effect of divine's proposed acquisition of RoweCom on the:


unaudited
statements of operations for the six months ended June 30, 2001 and the year ended December 31, 2000 of divine; and


unaudited
balance sheet as of June 30, 2001 of divine.

The following unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements also describe the pro forma effect of divine's proposed acquisitions of eshare communications, Inc. and Open Market, Inc.
discussed below. The purpose of these pro forma financial statements is to demonstrate how the combined financial statements of these businesses might have appeared if each of the mergers had been
completed at the beginning of the periods presented.

    In addition to the pending merger between divine and RoweCom, on July 8, 2001, divine entered into a definitive agreement to acquire eshare, which provides customer interaction
management products and services. Completion of the eshare merger is subject to a number of conditions, including eshare shareholder approval and, if required, divine stockholder approval. In
addition, on August 15, 2001, divine entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Open Market, which provides content-driven e-business solutions to enterprises. Completion of the
Open Market merger is subject to a number of conditions, including Open Market stockholder approval and, if required, divine stockholder approval. The following unaudited pro forma condensed combined
financial statements reflect the acquisition of RoweCom alone as well as the acquisitions of RoweCom, eshare and Open Market together.

    divine has prepared the unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements using the purchase method of accounting for all these transactions. Because the unaudited pro forma
condensed combined financial statements are based upon the financial condition and operating results of RoweCom, eshare and Open Market during periods when they were not under the control, influence
or management of divine, the information presented may not be

indicative of the results that would have actually occurred had the acquisitions been completed as of the respective periods presented, nor is it indicative of future financial or operating results.
divine expects to incur reorganization and integration expenses as well as potential operating efficiencies as a result of the acquisitions of RoweCom, eshare and Open Market. The unaudited pro forma
condensed combined financial statements do not give effect to any synergies that may occur due to the integration of RoweCom, eshare and Open Market with divine, nor do they take into account the
effect of any potential changes to accounting policies, including with respect to the recognition of revenues, of the acquired entities after the mergers due to the integration of their businesses
into divine's business model. The unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements should be read along with the historical financial statements of divine and the related notes,
incorporated by reference in this proxy statement/prospectus, and the historical financial statements of RoweCom and the related notes, included elsewhere in this proxy statement/prospectus.

    Certain
assets and liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets of RoweCom, eshare and Open Market have been reclassified to conform to the divine line item presentation in the
unaudited pro forma condensed combined balance sheet. Certain expenses and other deductions in the consolidated statements of operations of RoweCom, eshare and Open Market have been reclassified to
conform to the divine line item presentation in the unaudited pro forma condensed combined statements of operations.

Notes to Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Combined Financial Statements  

1.
Basis
of Presentation 

    The unaudited pro forma condensed combined balance sheet as of June 30, 2001 gives effect to the acquisitions of RoweCom, eshare and Open Market as if they occurred on that
date. The unaudited pro forma condensed combined statements of operations for the year ended December 31, 2000 and the six months ended June 30, 2001 give effect to the acquisitions of
RoweCom, eshare, and Open Market as if they had occurred on January 1, 2000.

    The
following summarizes information concerning the estimated purchase price allocation for the acquisitions of RoweCom, eshare and Open Market.

    The
purchase prices include $500,000 of estimated acquisition costs relating to each acquisition. The Open Market purchase price also includes $5,000,000 paid by divine to Open Market
in conjunction with a secured credit facility signed in connection with the Open Market merger agreement. 

    In this merger, divine will issue 0.75 of a share of divine common stock for each outstanding share of RoweCom common stock. Additionally, each RoweCom warrant and "in-the-money"
option will be converted to a warrant or fully-vested option to buy shares of divine common stock, generally at the 0.75 exchange ratio. For purposes of the unaudited pro forma condensed combined
financial statements, the number of shares, options and warrants assumed to be issued by divine in the RoweCom merger has been calculated based on the number of RoweCom shares, options and warrants
outstanding as of September 10, 2001. For the RoweCom merger, the assumed fair value of divine common stock for purchase accounting purposes is $1.44, which represents the average of divine's
closing price on the first day the agreed upon terms of the RoweCom merger were announced by divine (July 9, 2001) and the three business days before and after the announcement date.

    The
merger between divine and eshare is a stock-for-stock transaction. The number of shares to be issued by divine in the eshare merger is yet to be
determined, and is dependent on the divine average closing price, which is the average of the closing sale price per share of divine's common stock as reported on the Nasdaq National Market for the
ten consecutive trading days ending two trading days prior to the closing date of the merger. If the divine average closing price is greater than $2.39 but less than $2.82, then eshare shareholders
will receive 1.30 shares of divine common stock for each eshare common share they own. If the divine average closing price is $2.82 or greater, then eshare shareholders will receive a number of shares
of divine common stock for each eshare common share they own equal to $3.653 divided by the divine average closing price. If the divine average closing price is $2.39 or less, then eshare shareholders
will receive a number of shares of divine common stock for each eshare common share they own equal to $3.12 divided by the greater of the divine 

average closing price or $1.00. Additionally, each eshare "in-the-money" option will be converted, at the same conversion rate applied to outstanding eshare common shares, to a fully-vested option to
buy shares of divine common stock. For purposes of the unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information, the number of shares and options assumed to be issued by divine in the eshare
merger has been calculated based on the number of eshare common shares and options outstanding as of September 10, 2001, and using the divine average closing price as of September 10,
2001, which was $1.06. For the eshare merger, the

divine average closing price is also assumed to be the fair value of divine common stock for purchase accounting purposes.

    In the Open Market merger, divine will issue 44,454,961 shares of divine common stock. In addition, all outstanding options and warrants to purchase shares of Open Market stock will
convert to options and warrants to purchase divine common stock. The conversion ratio to be applied to the number and exercise price of the Open Market options and warrants is driven by the number of
Open Market common shares outstanding at the closing of the merger and the number of shares of divine common stock to be issued to holders of Open Market's Series E preferred stock. For
purposes of the unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements, this conversion ratio has been calculated as 0.8326, based on the number of Open Market common shares outstanding as of
September 10, 2001. For the Open Market merger, the assumed fair value of divine common stock for purchase accounting purposes is $1.26, which represents the average of divine's closing price
on the first day the agreed upon terms of the Open Market merger were announced by divine (August 16, 2001) and the three business days before and after the announcement date.

    The effects of the RoweCom, eshare and Open Market mergers have been presented using the purchase method of accounting. Accordingly, the purchase price was allocated to the assets
acquired and liabilities assumed based upon management's best preliminary estimate of fair value with any excess purchase price being allocated to goodwill or other identifiable intangibles. The
preliminary allocation of the purchase price may be subject to further adjustments, as divine finalizes its allocation of purchase price in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
The pro forma adjustments related to the purchase price allocation of the acquisitions represent management's best estimate of the effects of these transactions.

2.
Pro
Forma Balance Sheet Adjustments

(a)
Reflects
the assumed issuance of 10,164,559 shares of divine common stock and the elimination of RoweCom's equity in consolidation. Also reflects the elimination of RoweCom's
stand-alone goodwill and other intangible assets of $15,593,000 and the establishment by divine of goodwill and other intangible assets of $49,290,000, which represents the value of shares of divine
common stock assumed to be issued in excess of the estimated fair value of RoweCom's tangible net assets as of June 30, 2001.

(b)
Reflects
the issuance of warrants to purchase 1,559,543 shares of divine common stock, representing the number of RoweCom warrants outstanding as of September 10, 2001, as
converted per the merger agreement. The Black-Scholes fair value of these warrants is $1,138,000 and has been included as a component of the purchase price.

(c)
Reflects
divine's estimated acquisition costs of $500,000 for each of the acquisitions.

(d)
Reflects
the assumed issuance of 64,377,716 shares of divine common stock and the elimination of eshare's equity in consolidation. Also reflects the elimination of eshare's deferred
tax assets of $10,583,000 and stand-alone goodwill and other intangible assets of $3,611,000, and the establishment by divine of goodwill and other intangible assets of $41,301,000, which represents
the value of shares of divine common stock issued in excess of the estimated fair value of eshare's tangible net assets as of June 30, 2001.

(e)
Reflects
the assumed issuance of options to purchase 4,732,364 shares of divine common stock. This is the number of "in-the-money" eshare options as of September 10, 2001, as
converted per the merger agreement. The Black-Scholes fair value of these options is $4,439,000 and has been included as a component of the purchase price.

(f)
Accounts
payable and accumulated deficit have been adjusted to eliminate the unpaid balance for software sold by eshare to Brandango, a consolidated associated company of divine
that ceased operations in 2000. Accumulated deficit is affected instead of accounts receivable, because eshare wrote off this unpaid balance prior to June 30, 2001.

(g)
Reflects
the effect of real estate options which are dependent on the closing of the merger of divine with eshare. Upon closing, divine has agreed to enter into agreements with
Szlam Partners, L.P. and Melita House, Inc., pursuant to which divine will pay approximately $3,703,000 and $2,047,000, respectively, for ten-year options to purchase eshare's U.S.
and United Kingdom headquarters.

(h)
Reflects
the assumed issuance of 44,454,961 shares of divine common stock and the elimination of Open Market's equity and redeemable preferred stock in consolidation. Also reflects
the establishment by divine of goodwill and other intangible assets of $49,810,000,

which
represents the value of shares of divine common stock assumed to be issued, and cash paid by divine under a secured credit facility with Open Market, in excess of the estimated fair value of
Open Market's tangible net assets as of June 30, 2001.

(i)
Reflects
the assumed issuance of options to purchase 8,333,328 shares of divine common stock, which represents the number of Open Market options outstanding as of
September 10, 2001, as converted per the merger agreement. Also reflects the issuance of 1,460,554 warrants to purchase divine common stock, which represents the number of Open Market warrants
outstanding as of September 10, 2001, as converted per the merger agreement. The Black-Scholes fair value of these options and warrants was $5,544,000 and has been included as a component of
the purchase price. Based on the number and intrinsic value of "in-the-money" Open Market options on September 10, 2001, up to approximately $48,000 of the goodwill recorded as a result of the
option conversion may be reclassified to unearned stock-based compensation, depending on the remaining vesting period of each "in-the-money" option. For purposes of the unaudited pro forma condensed
combined financial statements, none of the intrinsic value of these options has been recorded as unearned stock-based compensation.

3.
Pro
Forma Statement of Operations Adjustments 

    The
pro forma statement of operations adjustments for the year ended December 31, 2000 consist of: 

(j)
Product
revenues have been adjusted to reflect the sale, during 2000, of software by eshare to Brandango. The sale price of the software was approximately $1,815,000. Of this
amount, $403,000 had been depreciated and $1,412,000 had been written off to impairment expenses when Brandango ceased operations later in 2000.

(k)
Selling,
general and administrative expenses have been adjusted to reflect the amortization of goodwill and other intangible assets associated with the acquisitions over an
estimated useful life of three years, and to eliminate the historical amortization of goodwill and other intangible assets recorded by RoweCom, eshare and Open Market. Under the provisions of
SFAS No. 142, 
Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets
, approved by the Financial Accounting Standards Board on June 29, 2001, goodwill
acquired in transactions completed after June 30, 2001 will not be amortized. As the RoweCom, eshare and Open Market acquisitions are expected to be completed in the fourth quarter of 2001,
divine's operating results will not

reflect
any goodwill amortization expense related to these acquisitions. Note that SFAS No. 142 will require the amortization of intangible assets with determinable useful lives, which are
generally intangible assets other than goodwill, over the estimated useful life of those assets. The excess purchase price over the estimated fair values of the tangible net assets of RoweCom, eshare
and Open Market have not yet been allocated between goodwill and other intangible assets. For purposes of the pro forma condensed combined statements of operations, the entire excess purchase price is
considered to be other intangible assets and therefore is amortizable.

Selling,
general and administrative expenses have been adjusted to reflect the amortization of goodwill and other intangible assets associated with the acquisitions over a useful
life of three years, and to eliminate the historical amortization of goodwill and other intangible assets recorded by RoweCom, eshare and Open Market. Under the provisions of SFAS
No. 142, 
Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets
, approved by the Financial Accounting Standards Board on June 29, 2001, goodwill acquired in
transactions completed after June 30, 2001 will not be amortized. As the RoweCom, eshare and Open Market acquisitions are expected to be completed in the fourth quarter of 2001, divine's
operating results will not reflect any goodwill amortization expense related to these acquisitions. Note that SFAS No. 142 will require the amortization of intangible assets with determinable
useful lives, which are generally intangible assets other than goodwill, over the estimated useful life of those assets. The excess purchase price over the estimated fair values of the tangible net
assets of RoweCom, eshare and Open Market have not yet been allocated between goodwill and other intangible assets. For purposes of the pro

forma
condensed combined statements of operations, the entire excess purchase price is considered to be other intangible assets and therefore is amortizable.

Sensitivity
Analysis on divine Average Closing Price 

    As noted in Note 1 above, the number of shares assumed to be issued by divine in the eshare merger has been calculated using $1.06 as the divine average closing price.
Additionally, the fair value of divine common stock for purchase accounting purposes has been assumed to be $1.06. If the divine average closing price and fair value of divine common stock were $1.00,
divine would issue 68,435,596 shares in the eshare merger, and would record $46,908,000 of goodwill and other intangible assets. Related amortization expense, for purposes of the unaudited pro forma
condensed combined statements of operations, would be $14,615,000 and $7,233,000 for the year ended December 31, 2000 and the six months ended June 30, 2001, respectively.

    If the divine average closing price and fair value of divine common stock were $2.50, divine would issue 28,514,832 shares in the eshare merger, and would record $49,760,000 of
goodwill and other intangible assets. Related amortization expense, for purposes of the unaudited pro forma condensed combined statements of operations, would be $15,566,000 and $7,708,000 for the
year ended December 31, 2000 and the six months ended June 30, 2001, respectively.

    If the divine average closing price and fair value of divine common stock were $3.00, divine would issue 26,708,892 shares in the eshare merger, and would record $58,599,000 of
goodwill and other intangible assets. Related amortization expense, for purposes of the unaudited pro forma condensed combined statements of operations, would be $18,512,000 and $9,182,000 for the
year ended December 31, 2000 and the six months ended June 30, 2001, respectively.

a community of associated companies in which we invested. From September 30, 1999 to December 31, 2000, we acquired interests in 40 associated companies, established a total of 13
associated companies when we identified opportunities consistent with our business strategy, and also further developed our operational procedures and capabilities. 

    In
February 2001, we announced our strategy to primarily focus on enterprise Web solutions, and changed our name to divine, inc. We no longer reflect separately our
interests in our remaining associated companies that provide Web-based technology, software, professional services and managed applications. Instead, the operations of these businesses are
a part of our core business strategy. Other of our associated companies offer software and services focused on e-commerce and vertical markets, which we include in our divine 

interVentures segment. As of June 30, 2001, there were 22 companies in our divine interVentures segment. 

 Our Growth Strategy  

    Our objective is to become the leading provider of enterprise Web solutions that offer global businesses the ability to improve collaboration, workflow and
business relationships by delivering a powerful combination of technology, software, services and managed applications capabilities. As the flow of information becomes more liberated and more complex,
we believe that a new type of solution provider is required to unite all of the skills and emerging technologies needed to create advance enterprise Web solutions that position companies to go beyond
the processing of transactions and operate at the leading edge of their industries. In order to achieve this objective, we have adopted the following key elements of our strategy: 


Become a recognized leader in advanced enterprise solutions
. We currently have over 500 customers
consisting of predominantly Global 2000 companies and high-growth middle-market companies. These customers are serviced by one or more of our four principal business units. By expanding
our relationships with these customers, we can enhance our reputation and visibility and capitalize on cross-selling opportunities with their customers, suppliers, partners and distributors.


Develop, acquire and integrate offerings and solutions
. We plan to focus on the development, acquisition
and integration of components that can be combined to form a powerful set of services, technology and hosting capabilities that can advance and extend our customers' businesses to include
external and internal business communities.


Target a specific customer base
. We plan to target customers whom we believe can benefit most readily from
greater collaboration, more efficient workflow and better management of business relationships between their customers, employees, partners, suppliers, prospects and sources of information. We believe
that these customers are primarily concentrated in information-intensive businesses such as the financial services, insurance, energy, pharmaceutical, biotechnology and telecommunications industries.


Support and complement our solutions through alliances with business partners.
 We intend to establish
strategic alliances with a number of companies like our strategic alliance with Computer Associates International, Inc. ("CA"), which is also one of our strategic investors. CA's professional
expertise enhances the range and quality of our Professional Services and CA's Jasmine
ii
 Portal Software is a key component of our Enterprise Solutions
Portal. We believe that strategic alliances will enable us to improve our ability to attract and retain customers who prefer to deal with larger, more stable solutions providers, provide additional
channels for our products, and enable us to build industry-specific solutions for our customers.


Position divine as a technology owner and solutions integrator
. We plan to differentiate divine from other
solutions delivery organizations by positioning divine as a technology owner and solutions integrator. We intend to gain a strategic advantage by acquiring and developing innovative technologies and
making these part of our broader solutions in order to leverage their full potential. 

divine's Recent Developments  

    Since July 1, 2001, divine has completed, or entered into agreements in connection with, a number of other acquisitions to further its business
strategy.

 Merger with eshare  

    divine entered into an agreement and plan of merger with eshare communications, Inc. on July 8, 2001, pursuant to which eshare will be merged
with and into DES Acquisition Company, a direct, wholly-owned subsidiary of divine. eshare is a provider of customer interaction management, or CIM, software products and services. These CIM software
applications enable eshare's customers to effectively manage new and existing customers across multiple communications channels, including voice, email, interactive Web chat and
voice-over-internet protocol. Following the eshare merger, eshare will be a wholly-owned subsidiary of divine. 

    Upon
consummation of the eshare merger, each of the approximately 21.9 million outstanding shares of eshare common stock will be converted into the right to receive shares of
divine common stock as follows: 


If
the average closing price on the Nasdaq National Market of divine common stock for the ten trading days ending two trading days before the closing date
of the eshare merger, which we refer to as the divine average closing price, is greater than $2.39 but less than $2.82, then
eshare shareholders will receive 1.30 shares of divine common stock for each eshare common share they own;


If
the divine average closing price is $2.82 or greater, then eshare shareholders will receive a number of shares of divine common stock for each eshare
common share they own equal to $3.653 divided by the divine average closing price; and


If
the divine average closing price is $2.39 or less, then eshare shareholders will receive a number of shares of divine common stock for each eshare
common share they own equal to $3.12 divided by the greater of the divine average closing price or $1.00. 

    If
pursuant to these adjustments, more than 28,546,506 shares of divine common stock are to be issued to eshare shareholders in the eshare merger, divine may elect to pay cash instead
of any or all of the excess shares in an amount per share equal to the divine average closing price. However, because divine and eshare intend for the merger to be a tax-free
reorganization, divine will not pay cash in excess of 50% of the total consideration paid to all eshare shareholders. 

    In addition, each outstanding option to purchase shares of eshare common stock that has an exercise price that, when divided by the eshare exchange ratio, is less than or equal to the
closing price of divine common stock on the day prior to the consummation of the eshare merger will become fully exercisable at the adjusted exercise price for a number of shares of divine common
stock equal to the number of shares of eshare common stock subject to the option multiplied by the eshare exchange ratio. All other eshare stock options will be cancelled. Based on the divine average
closing price and an eshare exchange ratio of 2.935 on September 10, 2001, divine would assume options to purchase approximately 4,732,364 shares of divine common stock in the eshare merger.
divine has also agreed to grant to eshare employees who become employees of divine after the eshare merger is consummated an

aggregate number of options to purchase its common stock equal to 13% of the aggregate number of shares of divine common stock issued to eshare shareholders in the eshare merger. 

    Consummation of the eshare merger is subject to a number of conditions, including (1) approval of the eshare merger by the shareholders of eshare and, if necessary, the
stockholders of divine and (2) the expiration or termination of the waiting period under the

Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976. Szlam Partners, L.P., an entity beneficially owned by Aleksander Szlam, the chairman and chief executive officer of eshare, has
entered into an agreement with divine to vote 10,745,969 of its eshare common shares, representing approximately 49% of the eshare common shares that were outstanding as of the record date of the
eshare special meeting of stockholders, in favor of the eshare merger. Mr. Filipowski, divine's chairman and chief executive officer, is also a director of eshare. Mr. Filipowski holds
413,333 shares of eshare common stock, representing approximately 2% of the eshare common shares that were outstanding as of the record date of the eshare special meeting of stockholders, and has
indicated that he intends to vote these shares in favor of the merger. The eshare merger agreement may be terminated under certain circumstances, including by eshare if at any time after the
registration statement registering the shares of divine common stock to be issued in the eshare merger is declared effective, but prior to the eshare shareholders meeting, the average per share
closing price of divine common stock for the previous ten trading days is less than $1.00. Under certain circumstances, termination of the eshare merger agreement will require divine or eshare, as
applicable, to pay the other party a $2,000,000 termination fee.

 Merger with Emicom  

    On July 18, 2001, divine acquired 67% of the equity interests of Emicom Group, Inc. that divine did not already own in exchange for a total of
13.8 million shares of divine common stock. divine has filed a registration statement on Form S-3 to register these shares for resale. Emicom has been an associated
company of divine since April 2000, when divine acquired a 33% interest in Emicom. Emicom is a technology holding company that provides capital and advisory services to early-stage technology
companies located in Israel. Emicom partners with privately-held technology-related companies in the telecommunications, cellular, Internet infrastructure and enterprise software markets.
At the time of the acquisition, Emicom held interests in four technology-related companies and had approximately $34 million in uncommitted cash reserves. divine expects that Emicom will
provide divine a base of operations in the Israeli high-tech market, a platform from which to expand an international customer base and a channel for divine's expansion in Israel and
Europe.

 Acquisition of Assets of Intira  

    On July 29, 2001, divine entered into an agreement to purchase substantially all of the assets of Intira Corporation, subject to bankruptcy court
approval. Intira provides information technology and network infrastructure for online business applications and is based in Pleasanton, California. Under the terms of the purchase agreement, divine
will purchase substantially all of the assets of Intira for $1 million in cash, provide Intira with a $6.8 million debtor-in-possession credit facility and assume
certain obligations, which divine intends to
restructure on more favorable terms. divine expects that the acquisition of Intira's assets will add to divine's capabilities in its Managed Applications business unit and provide business
opportunities for its other business units. 

 Acquisition of Fracta Networks  

    In August 2001, we acquired certain assets, subject to certain liabilities, of Fracta Networks, Inc., a provider of personal content management
solutions. Among the assets we acquired was Fracta Networks' software, FractaNet, an application that allows users to easily capture portions of documents, spreadsheets or Web sites. For
these assets, divine issued warrants to purchase 1,000,000 shares of divine common stock. In addition, divine has agreed to grant Fracta Network's continuing employees options to purchase 468,000
shares of divine common stock. 

 Merger with Open Market  

    On August 15, 2001, divine entered into an agreement and plan of merger with Open Market, Inc., pursuant to which divine will acquire Open
Market. Open Market provides enterprise content management and delivery applications software. Open Market's software solutions are designed to enable businesses and other organizations to use the
Internet to better manage interactions with their site visitors, employees, customers and distribution channels.

    Upon consummation of the Open Market merger, each outstanding share of Open Market common stock will be converted into the right to receive that number of shares of divine common
stock equal to 44,285,714 divided by the total number of shares of Open Market common stock deemed outstanding as of the closing of the merger, giving effect to the conversion of any then-outstanding
shares of Open Market Series E preferred stock but less shares of Open Market common stock issued after August 3, 2001 pursuant to Open Market's employee stock purchase plans and exercises of
Open Market options and warrants. The maximum Open Market exchange ratio will be 0.8394 and the minimum Open Market exchange ratio will be 0.8326. Completion of the Open Market merger is dependent on
a number of conditions, including (1) approval by Open Market stockholders and if necessary,

divine stockholders and (2) expiration or termination of any waiting periods under any applicable antitrust laws.

    When the Open Market merger is completed, each of the outstanding Open Market stock options will convert into a fully exercisable option to purchase a number of shares of divine
common stock equal to the number of shares of Open Market common stock underlying the stock option multiplied by the exchange ratio. The exercise price for these stock options will be equal to the
current exercise price divided by the exchange ratio. When the Open Market merger is completed, each of the outstanding warrants to purchase shares of Open Market's common stock will be converted into
a warrant to purchase the number of shares of divine's common stock equal to the number of shares of Open Market's common stock subject to such warrant multiplied by the exchange ratio, with an
exercise price equal to the exercise price of that warrant divided by the exchange ratio. Based on an Open Market exchange ratio of .8326 on September 10, 2001, divine would assume options to
purchase 8,333,328 shares of divine common stock and warrants to purchase 1,460,554 shares of divine common stock after the merger. Stockholders holding approximately 10.5% of the shares
of Open Market common stock that were outstanding as of the record date for the Open Market special meeting of stockholders have entered into a stockholder agreement with divine to vote their shares
in favor of the Open Market merger. The Open Market merger may be terminated under certain circumstances. Under certain circumstances, termination of the

Open Market merger agreement will require divine or Open Market, as applicable, to pay the other party a $2,600,000 termination fee. 

 Acquisition of marchFIRST GmbH iI

    In September 2001, divine entered into an agreement to acquire substantially all of the assets of marchFIRST GmbH iI that comprised its former Munich
and Hamburg operations. divine has agreed to pay approximately DM 10.5 million (approximately US $4.8 million) for these assets. Upon completion of the acquisition, the
assets purchased from marchFIRST GmbH iI will operate as a wholly-owned subsidiary of divine under the name divine GmbH from offices in Munich and Hamburg.

 Acquisition of Parlano

    On September 7, 2001, divine acquired from UBS AG a 21% equity interest in Parlano, Inc. in exchange for 3,596,007 shares of divine
common stock. divine has filed a registration statement on Form S-3 to register these shares for resale. Parlano has been an associated company of divine since February 2000, when divine
acquired a 75% equity interest in Parlano. As a result of the acquisition, divine now owns approximately 96% of the issued and outstanding capital stock of Parlano and intends to purchase the
remaining interest in a short-form merger in the near future. Parlano, which is headquartered in Chicago, Illinois, is a provider of global solutions for real-time business communications and
collaboration in an enterprise environment. The software licensed by Parlano allows information to be captured, filtered and stored in corporate databases and used in knowledge management
applications.

    We
anticipate that the integration of these acquired companies into our products and services offering will help us to deliver a combination of software, technology-based solutions,
professional services and hosting/managed applications that allow businesses to increase efficiency, generate revenue, advance their brand and build customer loyalty. 

INFORMATION REGARDING ROWECOM    

Company Overview  

    RoweCom is a leading business-to-business provider of high-quality service and e-commerce solutions for
purchasing and managing the acquisition of magazines, newspapers, journals and e-journals, books and other printed sources of commercial, scientific and general interest information and
analysis. RoweCom refers to these products as "knowledge resources." RoweCom offers its clients and their employees easy and convenient access to one of the largest catalogs of knowledge resources on
the Internet. RoweCom also provides businesses and academic and other non-profit institutions with a highly effective means of managing and controlling purchases of knowledge resources and
reducing costs. RoweCom targets clients in knowledge-intense industries, such as business and financial services; biomedical; academic and the federal government; and corporate and professional
services. 

    RoweCom
was organized as a Delaware corporation in April 1997 as the eventual successor to a corporation that commenced operations in 1994. RoweCom is headquartered in
Westwood, Massachusetts, and has several offices in North America and in Spain, France, the United Kingdom, Australia, Korea and Taiwan. 

Nasdaq National Market  

    RoweCom's common stock is listed on the Nasdaq National Market. To remain listed on this market, RoweCom must meet Nasdaq's listing maintenance standards and
abide by Nasdaq's rules governing listed companies. RoweCom is not currently in compliance with these standards. RoweCom was first notified by Nasdaq that it was not in compliance on March 29,
2001 and on June 28, 2001 was notified that its common stock would be delisted. RoweCom had an appeal hearing before the Nasdaq Listing Qualifications Panel on August 16, 2001. The
hearing related to RoweCom's failure to comply with the stock bid price requirements set

forth in Nasdaq Marketplace Rule 4450(a)(05) and the net tangible assets, market capitalization, total assets and total income requirements set forth in Nasdaq Marketplace Rules 4450(a)(03) and
4450(b)(01). The Nasdaq Listing Qualifications Panel notified RoweCom on September 7, 2001 that in light of the proposed merger, RoweCom's common stock can remain listed on the Nasdaq National
Market until November 5, 2001.

Services  

    RoweCom's services fall into two main categories: library services and desktop services. 

 Library Services  

    On October 4, 1999, RoweCom acquired all of the issued and outstanding capital stock of Dawson, Inc., a Delaware corporation, and certain assets
of United Kingdom-based Dawson Information Services Group relating to subscription services, a Web-based information searching and retrieval tool, and library information management
software and services. Dawson's subscription business had total revenues in fiscal year ended October 2, 1999 of approximately $400.6 million, which were generated primarily from
centralized purchasing processes. The acquired Dawson group included over 20,000 clients, 500 employees and operations in the following nine locations: Folkestone, United Kingdom; Paris, France; 

Madrid, Spain; London, Ontario; Montreal, Quebec; Westwood, Massachusetts; Oregon, Illinois; Chantilly, Virginia; and Carlsbad, California. 

    With
the acquisition of Dawson's subscription business, RoweCom began to concentrate on solutions for libraries and information centers. RoweCom utilizes high-quality
personal service, comprehensive management reporting and the latest Web technology to manage and consolidate print and online serial subscriptions. In the United States, RoweCom offers its library
services under the brand name of "Faxon Library Services from RoweCom." 

    The
library services team at RoweCom focuses on simplifying and enhancing the centralized purchasing process for librarians and knowledge managers. RoweCom's information
professionals have designed services to simplify the increasingly complex set of tasks associated with the acquisition and management of information resources. By providing a variety of services,
including e-journal strategies, subscription management, electronic data interchange or EDI solutions, and a true working partnership, RoweCom can help clients meet their knowledge
resource needs more effectively. RoweCom generated approximately 99% of its revenues for the year ended December 31, 2000 through its library services team. RoweCom believes that revenues
generated through library services will remain relatively stable. 

    Included
below is a short description of various services RoweCom offers through its library services team. 


kLibrary.
 kLibrary, a Web-based subscription ordering and management system,
provides libraries with quick access to the current bibliographic and financial data of more than 240,000 serial, continuation, CD-ROM and electronic journal titles available through
RoweCom. Additionally, kLibrary offers clients an array of bibliographic features that help to streamline workloads and maximize their library's effectiveness.


FIRSt.
 FIRSt is RoweCom's back issue service for locating missing issues. It features
convenient Web-based ordering, affordable pricing and various shipping options.


Serials Update Service.
 The Serials Update Service is a Web-based bibliographic
tool. Fully searchable and updated daily, it provides timely information about title changes, discontinued journals, order status adjustments and other similar items.


E-journal Solutions.
 RoweCom offers a wide range of services that help
librarians and knowledge managers acquire and manage their electronic journal collections, including: comprehensive reports on electronic titles; expert help on negotiating, licensing and registration
issues; e-journal set-up; and a sophisticated research, access and retrieval product.


Information Quest.
 Information Quest is a powerful search engine that provides access and
delivery of full image content from over 3,000 e-journals; a current awareness  service, with links to articles; and multiple document delivery and payment options,
including pay-per-view.


License Depot.
 License Depot gives a library instant access to e-journal
licensing and registration terms and conditions; a growing database of information for over 5,000 electronic titles; and links to the full license agreements and registration forms of more than 200
publishers. RoweCom has recently integrated this service with the kLibrary service. 


Collection Analysis and Subscription Management Tools.
 RoweCom offers three powerful and
sophisticated series of customized reporting, budgeting and collection analysis tools that help librarians and knowledge professionals manage, evaluate and assess serials collections.


Electronic Data Interchange.
 RoweCom provides a full range of working EDI solutions with all
leading integrated library systems. In addition, RoweCom develops new interface technologies using extensible mark-up language or XML. 

 Desktop Services  

    kStore.
  RoweCom's kStore facilitates decentralized purchasing of knowledge resources by businesses and their employees
while at the same time giving management the tools required to effectively control knowledge resource purchases. The kStore provides businesses with a single comprehensive source for the purchase of
knowledge resources, offering more than 200,000 magazines, journals and newspapers from over 20,000 publishers, and millions of books through RoweCom's alliance with barnesandnoble.com. The kStore's
automated service is easily accessible from an employee's desktop computer via the corporate intranet or the Internet and permits the employee to find, order, and pay for knowledge resources quickly
and conveniently. At the same time, the kStore provides managers with detailed reports of knowledge resource purchases by their employees and permits them to institute customized approval procedures.
The kStore also helps management reduce the costs of knowledge resource acquisition by eliminating many of the inefficiencies of traditional knowledge resource acquisition methods and by offering
discounted prices on most titles. The kStore revenues accounted for only 1% of RoweCom's total revenues for the year ended December 31, 2000, but kStore purchases increased in year 2000
approximately 97% over the prior year. 

    E-procurement.
  Besides kStore services, e-procurement services are also offered through
RoweCom's desktop services. E-procurement software is a far-reaching generic solution that allows purchasing organizations to automate their processing of transactions among their members
and all the products or services offered within their organizations. Dedicated procurement software on the user's desktop provides access to multiple suppliers' e-catalogs that are hosted
by the company using the e-procurement software or linked through the Internet to the suppliers' sites. RoweCom has recently been named as a premier supplier of knowledge resource catalogs
to several major e-procurement software vendors. Some of the more significant vendors include Ariba, Commerce One, Metiom and Clarus. RoweCom was the first knowledge resource supplier to
be certified by Ariba. Both kStore and kLibrary are custom procurement applications dedicated to the unique requirements of knowledge resource service, acquisition and management. Revenue recognized
to date from e-procurement has been immaterial as RoweCom has only recently become an accredited supplier to the above named e-procurement software vendors. See also Note 14
"Operating Segment and Geographic Information" to RoweCom's Consolidated Financial Statements on page F-28. 

Industry Overview  

 Library Services  

    It is estimated that libraries presently spend over $20 billion a year on knowledge resources for their patrons. A major trend in publishing today is
the transition from print to 

electronic resources. Professional staff in libraries are facing overwhelming challenges in managing this transition within their institutions and in effectively acquiring, licensing and delivering
the electronic information that their users demand. They are actively seeking partners to provide outsourced services in these areas. RoweCom estimates that for the 2002 subscription year, 50% of the
subscriptions placed by RoweCom's clients will be for materials that are available in electronic format. 

    A
major area of electronic resource management that is proving difficult and time-consuming for professional library staff is that of licensing and negotiating with
publishers for access to
their electronic journals. RoweCom provides an innovative licensing service to its clients through which the clients assign an attorney-in-fact power to RoweCom for the
negotiations and signing of electronic resource licenses according to agreed upon terms and conditions. RoweCom also handles the ordering, payment and registration of electronic journals for its
clients. 

    Corporate
libraries and, to a lesser extent, academic and medical libraries are showing increasing interest in outsourcing many of the functions previously performed by clerical and
professional staff within the library. These functions often include acquisitions, serials management, document delivery, and even collection management. RoweCom offers outsourcing services for
serials management, both on and off-site. 

    A
major trend in academic and medical libraries is the vast increase in programs to digitize campus and institutional resources and form local, regional and national digital library
initiatives. Significant funding is available to libraries and consortia for the creation and sharing of digital collections. 

    Electronic
content delivery for libraries is becoming more critical as distance learning programs increase substantially on university and college campuses. The United States Distance
Learning Association defines distance learning as the acquisition of knowledge and skills through mediated information and instruction. Distance learning is used in all areas of education including
pre-K through grade 12, higher education, home school education, continuing education, corporate training, military and government training, and telemedicine. Services such as RoweCom's
Information Quest provide electronic access to articles as part of the library resources necessary to support distance learning education programs. RoweCom expects that access to additional electronic
content will be very attractive to libraries intent on maintaining their role of providing information resources to students on campus as well as those enrolled in distance learning programs. 

    Libraries
are becoming increasingly organized into local, regional and even national consortial organizations. These consortial models vary from buying organizations to full service
organizations. Library consortia often deal directly with publishers in purchasing and negotiating for consortial licenses for large electronic resource collections. Organizations such as RoweCom are
faced with the difficult challenge of developing services for consortia and ensuring that they are not excluded from the consortial buying process. 

    The
library community still places much importance on high-quality personal client service, as well as innovative, relevant technology and professional services. RoweCom
believes it is well-positioned to provide excellent service to libraries, to develop best-in-class products and
services designed by information professionals, and to significantly increase the value its adds to the traditional subscription services offered to RoweCom's libraries. 

 Desktop Services  

    The effective use of knowledge resources has become an increasingly important competitive advantage for businesses and other institutions. Timely and relevant
information, easily accessible to all members of an enterprise, has become critical to job productivity. The quantity and the degree of specialization of knowledge resources available to businesses
and their employees, and the cost of such resources have increased dramatically. It is estimated that businesses will spend more than $182 billion in the United States alone on knowledge
resources by 2003, according to the latest Veronis Suhler and Associates, Inc. market study. As a result, businesses and other institutions need efficient and cost effective methods for
managing the growing number of purchases of knowledge resources by employees. 

    The
growth in demand for knowledge resources is occurring at a time when the Internet and corporate intranets are becoming increasingly significant for communications and
e-commerce. RoweCom believes that spending on knowledge resources via the Internet and corporate intranets has also accelerated in recent years and will continue to increase in the future. 

    Most
companies currently do not have an efficient and easy-to-use means of executing and managing purchases of knowledge resources. Historically, the process
of purchasing knowledge resources has involved significant manual effort and has focused on the professional librarian or central purchasing group rather than the individual worker whose job
performance depends on such resources. This manually intensive, paper-based process requires finding the appropriate publishers, submitting written or telephone orders, processing multiple renewal
notices and completing expense reports for reimbursement. 

    Increasingly,
individual employees are purchasing knowledge resources directly from publishers and other vendors rather than ordering through a corporate library or central purchasing
group. As a result, employees are making numerous individual purchases from a large number of publishers and services using a variety of payment methods. RoweCom believes that, for most businesses,
the aggregate cost of purchases of knowledge resources made by individuals is significantly larger than the knowledge resource budget of the
corporate library or central purchasing group. Decentralized purchases make it difficult for businesses to manage employee purchases, control spending and prevent duplicative or unauthorized orders. 

    As
knowledge resources have become more numerous and specialized, the marketing and cost-effective distribution of such knowledge resources to appropriate users has become
difficult for publishers and other content providers. Conventional retail outlets do not reach the full range of individuals purchasing knowledge resources and cannot physically stock the entire range
of knowledge resources available. In addition, the cost to the publisher of maintaining inventories at multiple outlets is too high to allow the distribution through such outlets of specialized
knowledge resources that will only sell in limited numbers at any one outlet. 

Business Strategy  

    RoweCom's objective is to maintain and strengthen its position as a leading business-to-business provider of high quality service and
e-commerce solutions for purchasing and managing the acquisition of magazines, newspapers, journals and e-journals, books and 

other knowledge resources. Key elements of RoweCom's strategy for library and desktop services are set forth below. 

 Library Services  

    Maintain the Excellence of Services for the Library Market.
  RoweCom seeks to retain and increase the number of clients
in the bio-medical, academic and the federal government, and corporate and professional services markets by continuing to deliver advanced Web-based technology, while at the
same time providing personal, one-on-one professional service. 

    Implement a Comprehensive Library Services Development Strategy.
  The goals of RoweCom's library services development
program are as follows: 


to
proactively develop excellent, innovative products and services for libraries in order to help them deal with the growing complexities of acquiring and
managing their print and electronic resources;


to
create an integrated Web environment for serials, acquisitions and collection development staff, linked to a global catalog and a variety of
bibliographic sources, as well as to local systems and data;


to
add significant value to RoweCom's basic subscription services and ensure that RoweCom is providing the services that will be needed in the future as
well as today; and


to
maintain a high level of service and quick turnaround time for RoweCom's clients by continually re-examining RoweCom's internal processes
through constant analysis and increased use of technology. 

    Potential
benefits of RoweCom's library services development plan to its library clients include: 


streamlining
processing and intelligent decision-making by providing comprehensive, integrated information at their fingertips;


providing
quality personal service enhanced by technological innovation;


outsourcing
time-consuming clerical and professional tasks;


selecting
the desired level and mode of interaction with the library services team;


allowing
the examination of collections in a local context and in relation to the universe of existing resources with an array of analytical tools;


providing
expert assistance in managing the transition from a print to electronic environment; and


accessing
an expanded range of content, both print and electronic. 

    Continue to Enhance Client Services for Libraries.
  Management believes that RoweCom provides excellent service to its
library clients. As measures of RoweCom's service, RoweCom refers to service endorsements in sales call reports, feedback from RoweCom's client advisory board (which includes some of RoweCom's largest
and most prestigious academic and medical school clients), and the high client retention rate that RoweCom has experienced in the past 

year. In addition, the quality of RoweCom's Web-based services, electronic journal services and EDI solutions are consistently high. 

    Some
of the important factors contributing to the high level of service that RoweCom believes it provides are as follows: 


continuing
a strong commitment to high-quality personal service and a mandate to develop new tools for client service staff to allow them to
better serve their clients;


reducing
the turnaround time on all client requests;


developing
major new management tools that allow RoweCom to constantly track, monitor and adjust the level of RoweCom's service across all clients and
market segments;


committing
additional resources to extend the single point of contact to all of RoweCom's clients, regardless of size;


experiencing
an extraordinary average length of service among RoweCom's client service representatives, which leads to strong client relationships;


converting
RoweCom's clients to the kLibrary Web-based service, which has been embraced by RoweCom's clients in libraries and information
centers; and


continuing
an aggressive program of enhancements and added functionality to the kLibrary, with the goal of providing an integrated Web environment for
RoweCom's clients with links to RoweCom's global catalog, authoritative bibliographic sources and local systems and data. 

 Desktop Services  

    Penetrate the Business-to-Business Market for Desktop Services.
  RoweCom seeks to increase the
number of clients and individuals accessing the kStore from their desktop computers. RoweCom targets companies in knowledge-intense industries, such as business and financial services; biomedical;
academic and the federal government; and corporate and professional services. RoweCom's sales force seeks to develop new client relationships and to expand the use of the kStore by its existing
clients by increasing the awareness among, and availability to, the clients' employees. RoweCom believes that being the first knowledge resource purchasing solution on the clients' intranets promotes
brand loyalty and provides it with a significant competitive advantage. Once the kStore is adopted by the clients, RoweCom believes it is well-positioned to add new services and knowledge
resource offerings at minimal additional cost. 

    Increase Content and Functionality.
  RoweCom will continue to increase the content available to its clients and enhance
the capabilities of the kStore. RoweCom believes this will reinforce its position as a leading single source provider of knowledge resources to businesses on the Internet and will increase the overall
potential revenue per client. RoweCom has significantly increased its catalog of knowledge resources through strategic alliances with publishers and resellers, and has continued to add significant
serial titles each month in connection with acquisitions and in response to requests from its clients. In addition to expanding content,
RoweCom has introduced new features to the kStore, such as group-ordering, which allows a designated individual to order on behalf of a group of purchasers. 

RoweCom intends to further enhance the kStore's functionality by adding new capabilities, such as collaborative filtering, which provides users with information about purchases by other individuals
with similar buying profiles, and personalized recommendations of knowledge resources based on individual profiles and purchasing patterns. 

    Develop Strategic Alliances.
  RoweCom intends to continue to enter into strategic alliances to increase its channels of
distribution and available content. RoweCom currently has strategic alliances with NewsEdge, Ariba, Clarus, CommerceOne, RightWorks, barnesandnoble.com, Electronic Newstand, Inc., AsiaSmart, American
Express, Mindbranch, EdificeRex and Oracle. These alliances added new distribution channels, substantial additional content and improved pricing. RoweCom intends to enter into additional strategic
distribution alliances to obtain access to new clients and markets quickly and in a cost-effective manner. Relationships with other vendors can provide access to additional content
offerings and new service offerings such as distance learning, conferences and associations. 

    Expand Internationally.
  RoweCom intends to further expand its presence in markets outside the United States by
leveraging its international offices in Canada, the United Kingdom, France, Spain, Australia, Taiwan and Korea. By adding foreign language content and localizing and translating the kStore user
interface, management intends to enhance RoweCom's ability to fully service United States-based clients that have employees in other countries as well as non-United States clients. The
user interface for kLibrary is also available in multiple languages and the system is heavily used in Europe. RoweCom expects to expand internationally by means of strategic alliances and, possibly,
the acquisition of local content providers. The acquisition of Dawson is an example of the execution of this strategy. 

    Enhance Brand Recognition.
  RoweCom intends to continue promoting the kStore as the leading
business-to-business e-commerce solution for purchasing and managing the acquisition of knowledge resources. RoweCom intends to build brand recognition among
businesses through traditional advertising and attendance and presentations at major trade shows and conferences. RoweCom believes that promoting RoweCom's reputation as a leading online provider of
knowledge resources to the business-to-business market will: 


build
loyalty among RoweCom's client base;


increase
usage of the kStore by its clients' employees;


attract
new clients; and


promote
the value of RoweCom's brand name. 

    In
addition, RoweCom believes that a strong brand name will help it establish additional marketing and distribution alliances. 

E-Commerce Solutions  

 RoweCom's Library Services Web SolutionkLibrary  

    Backed by high-quality client service, kLibrary offers a complete solution for subscription ordering and management for RoweCom's library clients.
RoweCom believes kLibrary is the premier Web-based service of its kind that helps libraries simplify all their major serial tasks while at the same time providing clients with
high-quality bibliographic and supplemental title 

information at the desktop level. Available to all RoweCom library clients, kLibrary allows users to: 


search
from a catalog of print and electronic serial titles;


review
subscriptions and order history online;


order
and track the status of subscriptions;


process
claims; and


view
claim responses. 

    kLibrary
is currently accessed by over 1,000 clients in the United States and approximately 4,500 clients in Europe. RoweCom intends to continue its aggressive program of enhancements
and added functionality, with the goal of providing an integrated Web environment for RoweCom's clients with links to RoweCom's global catalog, to authoritative bibliographic sources and to local
systems and data. 

    The
four major components of the kLibrary interface are as follows: 


Searching.  kLibrary's
easy-to-use Web interface allows users to search a comprehensive database of over 200,000
titles by publication name, format, International Standard Serials Number, or publisher name. kLibrary's custom-designed search engine then sifts through the bibliographic and financial data and
produces clear results based on the specific search criteria entered into the system. For additional search help, kLibrary provides a "search tips" option.


Bibliographic
Detail.  kLibrary provides supplemental title information, including valuable Library of Congress data that links to vital
MARC records; information on combinations and memberships; links to e-journal licensing and registration; and additional links to abstract/index data and subject headings.


Ordering
and Claiming.  kLibrary offers a convenient, practical way to order subscriptions online. When a user places an order, the system
automatically displays the clients' default delivery methods, special shipping instructions, quantity, and any other preferences. The clients can then confirm the order (or override any option) with
one click. Online claiming through kLibrary provides clients with faster claim processing as well as an easy way to track missing issues. Clients can also check payment and invoice records and track
credits and supplemental charges in kLibrary.


Reporting.  By
clicking on the reports button on the kLibrary main menu, users can choose from among more than 75 reporting options.
Collection management reports and subscription profile reports enable users to manage, evaluate and access their serials collections, while a full range of price history reporting options help users
project future costs more accurately. 

 RoweCom's Desktop Services SolutionkStore  

    RoweCom's business-to-business e-commerce solution provides clients and their employees with an easy, convenient and
cost-effective way to purchase and manage the acquisition of knowledge resources through corporate intranets or the Internet. From the desktop computer, clients' employees can access a customized
RoweCom Web site offering more than 200,000 magazines, newspapers, journals and e-journals from over 20,000 

publishers and millions of books. RoweCom also provides publishers and other content providers with a unique destribution channel, which enables RoweCom to offer its clients additional content. Key
benefits of RoweCom's kStore solution are discussed below. 

    Convenience.
  RoweCom's kStore provides a single comprehensive source for the purchase of knowledge resources. kStore
clients gain access to one of the largest combined database of magazines, newspapers, journals and e-journals, books and other knowledge resources on the Internet. The highly automated
kStore service provides an easy and quick way to find, order and pay for knowledge resources by providing multiple electronic search functions and payment methods. These features facilitate ordering
and reduce paper purchase orders, invoices, check requests and manual approvals. The kStore can be made available through clients' intranet sites or the Internet, and may be accessed from employees'
desktop computers, the corporate library or central purchasing group using a point and click interface. The kStore also includes automated features, such as subscription renewal notifications and
24-hour, 7 days a week client support via telephone and the Internet. 

    Control.
  RoweCom's kStore allows businesses to proactively manage their purchases of knowledge resources through the
implementation of customized purchase approval procedures and the use of enterprise-wide purchasing reports. The kStore also helps businesses and their employees "buy smarter" by: 


indicating
to employees which items have already been purchased by other employees;


creating
greater awareness of available titles among employees; and


allowing
managers to analyze and guide employees' purchasing activities. 

The
kStore helps clients reduce duplicate orders, increase shared use of knowledge resources and enhance the likelihood that employees will purchase knowledge resources that will maximize their
productivity and performance. 

    Cost Savings.
  RoweCom offers substantial direct and indirect cost savings to its clients through the kStore. For
example, the kStore provides an additional 5% discount on the already discounted price of books available directly from barnesandnoble.com. Clients also achieve indirect cost savings through the
kStore's automated service, which reduces the manual processing of orders, approvals, payment, claims and renewals. In addition, the kStore enables enterprises to reduce duplicate orders and
facilitates resource sharing among employees. 

    Benefits to Publishers and other Content Providers.
  kStore provides publishers and other content providers with a
number of benefits, including: 


an
efficient and low cost direct distribution channel to targeted buyers, corporate libraries and centralized purchasing groups; knowledge resources are
shipped at the time of purchase, which enables vendors to reduce the levels of inventory required and therefore reduce the costs associated with stocking and returns;


an
increase in the sales of many second and third tier magazines, newspapers, journals, books and other knowledge resources that are not typically stocked
in physical locations and are generally hard to find; and


a
unique distribution channel that enables RoweCom to offer its clients additional content. 

    Content.
  RoweCom offers its clients access to one of the largest single source of magazines, newspapers, journals and
e-journals, books and other knowledge resources on the Internet, with access to more than 200,000 magazines, journals, e-journals, and newspapers from over 20,000 publishers,
and millions of books from its alliance with barnesandnoble.com. 

    Of
the more than 200,000 magazines, journals, e-journals and newspapers currently available from the kStore, approximately 800 are large circulation and general interest
magazines, and the balance consists of business and trade magazines and scientific and medical journals. Annual subscription rates range from under $50 for popular magazines to more than $10,000 for
certain scientific and medical journals. RoweCom intends to increase the content available to its kStore clients to reinforce its position as a leading single source provider of knowledge resources to
businesses and to increase the overall potential revenue per client. RoweCom augments its catalog of knowledge resources through strategic relationships with publishers and resellers and with
acquisitions in response to requests from its clients. 

    Management Tools.
  The kStore provides businesses with tools to better manage purchases of knowledge resources by their
employees. The kStore permits managers to create single or multiple levels of approvals that govern purchases by employees. The approvals that are included in a customized kStore may be either passive
or active. In a passive approval process, the order is compared to a series of previously defined purchasing protocols. If the order meets the criteria set forth in the protocol, the purchase is
automatically approved. If the order fails the protocol, it is either rejected or referred to a second approval process, which may be active or passive. In an active approval process, the affirmative
approval by a supervising manager of an order is required to consummate the purchase. The active approval process can be structured in a number of ways, including sending individual approval
e-mails to a manager requesting authorization for each order or compiling collections of requested approvals that may be reviewed on a periodic basis and then approved either individually
or collectively. 

    Payment and Fulfillment.
  RoweCom has developed proprietary software that fully automates the ordering and payment
process for purchases made through the kStore. The system is able to accept multiple payment options, including credit cards and authorized debits to disbursement or procurement accounts. Once orders
are placed and approved, payment instructions are sent to Banc One securely over the Internet. RoweCom has an ongoing relationship with Bank One Corporation, a large bank holding company in the United
States and the parent of Banc One, under which all orders are processed by the Banc One system
using RoweCom's proprietary software. RoweCom pays Banc One a nominal fee for each item ordered through the kStore. In some circumstances, RoweCom will invoice clients for kStore orders. 

    Although
RoweCom does not fulfill or deliver its clients' orders for a knowledge resource, it provides client support to ensure that the clients' expectations and needs are fulfilled
with respect to each order. Client representatives are available 24 hours per day, 7 days per week via the telephone and the Internet. Client support provides a vital role in increasing
sales to RoweCom's existing client base by focusing on client satisfaction and on increasing the total number of orders placed by each client. 

Sales and Marketing  

    RoweCom's sales and marketing strategy is designed to attract new clients, increase use of the desktop and library services by existing clients and their
employees, maximize repeat purchases and renewals and develop additional revenue opportunities. RoweCom's primary focus is a direct sales campaign to target companies and institutions in
knowledge-intense industries, such as: 


business
and financial services;


biomedical;


academic
and the federal government; and


corporate
and professional services. 

RoweCom
believes that this approach is both efficient and effective due to the size and potential of the target market as well as the level of service to which the targeted clients are
accustomed. The majority of the direct sales effort is conducted by RoweCom's national account managers, who are responsible for developing new client relationships, primarily in the United States. 

    Once
a client relationship has been established, a client is assigned an account executive who helps to assess the client's needs and to develop a formal deployment plan designed to
maximize the use of RoweCom's services. Account executives serve as the primary client contact after the initial sale and are responsible for maintaining the on-going relationship with the
client. Additionally, if the client is using RoweCom's kStore service, the account executives work with the client to maximize the number of employees who use the product to purchase knowledge
resources and to increase the number of purchases per employee. RoweCom also offers 24-hour, 7 days a week client support via telephone and the Internet. Client support provides a
vital role in increasing sales to RoweCom's existing client base by focusing on client satisfaction and on increasing the total number of orders placed by each client. 

    RoweCom's
marketing efforts also include print and direct mailings, participation in trade shows, co-marketing with strategic partners, and public relations campaigns to
build and reinforce RoweCom's brand recognition. 

Clients  

    RoweCom targets companies in knowledge-intense industries, such as business and financial services; biomedical; academic and the federal government; and
corporate and professional services. At June 30, 2001, RoweCom had approximately 20,000 clients, of which approximately 31% were corporate accounts and 69% were academic and non-profit
accounts. The following is a selective list of RoweCom's current clients, by industry sector. Each of 

these clients generated over $550,000 in revenues for RoweCom in 2000 and, in the aggregate, these clients generated approximately 6% of RoweCom's total revenues in 2000.

Competition  

    The market for the sale of magazines, newspapers, journals and e-journals, books and other knowledge resources to businesses and institutions is
intensely and increasingly competitive. Subscription agencies such as EBSCO Industries Inc. and Swets-Blackwells currently control a larger portion of the market for library services than
RoweCom. Although RoweCom has not yet had significant direct competition from other companies offering a service for purchasing and managing the acquisition of subscriptions and books with management
control features comparable to those of the kStore, EBSCO Industries Inc. recently launched a desktop e-commerce service similar to kStore. Thus, management expects that significant
competition may develop in the near future and it may have an adverse impact on RoweCom's business.
RoweCom's competitive landscape has been, and will continue to be, impacted by changes in the prevalence and acceptance of online commerce and changes in the knowledge resources industry. RoweCom
believes that the principal competitive factors in its emerging market will be: 


brand
recognition;


extent
of content offerings;


convenience;


management
control;


customization;


price;


client
service; and 


a
combined familiarity with the knowledge market and the latest enabling technologies. 

RoweCom
currently competes, or may in the future compete, directly or indirectly with companies that fall within the following categories: 


traditional
subscription agents, such as EBSCO Industries Inc. and Swets-Blackwells, which already have a significant market share of the library
services market, and may continue to increase their market share;


traditional
subscription agents, such as EBSCO Industries Inc., who have decided to focus on the corporate market, expand their service to include
control and management features, and significantly expand their knowledge resource offerings;


large,
well-established news and information providers, such as Dow Jones, Knight-Ridder, Lexis/Nexis, Pearson, Reuters and Thomson, any of
which might in the future decide to expand their product offerings to include magazines, newspapers, journals and e-journals, books and other knowledge resources of the type offered by
RoweCom;


major
consumer based online book resellers, such as Amazon.com or Borders.com, who may also decide to focus on the
business-to-business market, expand their service functionality to include control and management features such as those offered by RoweCom, or expand their knowledge resources
offerings;


consumer
online services and portals, such as Yahoo! and America Online, which may decide to focus on the business-to-business
market and expand their knowledge resources offering and management and control features;


publishers
and information providers, which may decide to increase their direct marketing efforts to the business-to-business
market or develop a competing service similar to the kStore or kLibrary; and


enterprise-wide
supplier management system providers which may decide to focus specifically on the knowledge resources markets. 

Intellectual Property  

    RoweCom regards its copyrights, service marks, trademarks, trade dress, trade secrets and similar intellectual property as critical to its success, and relies
on trademark and copyright law, trade secret protection and confidentiality and/or license agreements with its employees,
clients, partners and others to protect its proprietary rights. In addition to its United States common law rights in its trademarks and service marks, RoweCom pursues the registration of its
trademarks and service marks in the United States Patent and Trademark Office and has applied for the registration of certain of its trademarks and service marks. RoweCom has been granted trademark
registrations for the marks "RoweCom," "R RoweCom and Design," and "Subscribe." The marks "RoweCom" and "Subscribe" will remain in full force and effect without further action by RoweCom until
December 2003, and the mark "R RoweCom and Design" will remain in full force and effect without further action by RoweCom until January 2004. RoweCom also has pending registration applications
for the marks "kWorld" and "kStore," which have been preliminarily approved by the United States Patent and Trademark Office, but the "kStore" mark has been opposed by a third party. RoweCom also has
pending registration applications for the marks "kCentral" and "kLibrary," which applications are currently being examined by the United States Patent and Trademark Office. In addition, 

various subsidiaries of RoweCom have registered or applied for the registration of several trademarks and copyrights with the United States Patent and Trademark Office, the United States Copyright
Office and similar offices in foreign countries, including the United Kingdom and Taiwan. 

Technology  

    RoweCom uses both proprietary solutions and commercially available licensed technologies for its information technology needs. RoweCom's services are built
using industry standard Microsoft NT products utilizing the Internet Information Server, Microsoft Transaction Server, and SQL Server for database transactions. RoweCom uses products utilized by other
leaders in its industry. In addition, all of RoweCom's services are designed to process information using standard electronic data interchange, or EDI, transactions, as defined for the serials and
periodicals industry. RoweCom has also created extensible markup language, or XML, transactions to interface with other leading e-commerce providers. RoweCom seeks to maintain transaction
security through the use of industry standard secure sockets layer transactions, and uses proprietary EDI interfaces and private networks to ensure the integrity of client order information and credit
card transactions. RoweCom is able to scale the number of transactions that will be supported using load balancing and performance management tools developed for its standard platform. RoweCom uses
high performance Web and database servers on enterprise-level systems and has established high-performance Internet service provider links to ensure the availability of bandwidth. 

    As
of August 1, 2001, RoweCom had a team of 64 experienced developers and technicians addressing its technology needs. This group mainly focuses on back office processing and
developing RoweCom's major Web services: kStore, kLibrary, and Information Quest, which are available on a worldwide basis. These services can be customized to the particular needs of a client and
linked with corporate intranets, Internet service providers, content providers and other online services. Many of RoweCom's development and support professionals have specialized experience with
particular segments in the knowledge resource marketplace, such as corporate clients, corporate libraries, educational institutions, public libraries, and consumers. 

Employees  

    As of August 1, 2001, RoweCom had 574 full-time and 37 part-time employees. RoweCom also employs a limited number of independent
contractors and temporary employees on a periodic basis. None of RoweCom's employees are represented by a labor union and RoweCom considers its labor relations to be good. 

    RoweCom
believes its success depends to a significant extent on its ability to attract, motivate and retain highly skilled management and employees. To this end, RoweCom has focused
on maintaining incentive programs such as employee stock options, competitive compensation and benefits for its employees. 

Property  

    Rowecom is headquartered in Westwood, Massachusetts, where it occupies approximately 41,000 square feet under a seven year lease expiring December 31,
2006. This facility is used for executive office space, sales and marketing, finance and administration, client support, 

technical support and content acquisition. RoweCom maintains a regional office in the following locations, where it owns or leases office space.

Legal Proceedings  

    On February 22, 2001, RoweCom was served with a lawsuit brought by two former employees and stockholders of RoweCom, David Rifkin and Julie Beckerman.
The lawsuit was filed in the United States District Court for the District Court of New Jersey. The plaintiffs allege that RoweCom breached its employment agreements with the plaintiffs, resulting in
constructive termination of their employment with RoweCom. In addition, the plaintiffs allege that RoweCom failed to register certain securities with the SEC, preventing the plaintiffs from selling
their stock at an advantageous price. The lawsuit seeks $1.4 million in damages, which may be covered by insurance policies. RoweCom believes that the lawsuit 

is without merit and intends to defend it vigorously. RoweCom does not believe that the lawsuit will negatively impact its financial condition. 

    RoweCom, its chief executive officer, Richard Rowe, its former chief financial officer, Louis Hernandez, Jr., and the lead underwriters of RoweCom's initial public offering have been
named as defendants in at least four class action lawsuits filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York in July and August of 2001. Each action purports to be
brought on behalf of persons that purchased RoweCom common stock from March 9, 1999, when RoweCom's common stock began trading on the Nasdaq National Market, through December 6, 2000.
The actions seek unspecified damages as a result of various alleged securities law violations arising from activities purportedly engaged in by the underwriters in connection with RoweCom's initial
public offering. The complaints generally allege that RoweCom failed to disclose in the registration statement for the initial public offering certain arrangements between the underwriters and certain
purchasers of RoweCom common stock in the initial public offering, whereby these purchasers would agree to provide additional compensation to the underwriters and/or make purchases of additional
shares of RoweCom common stock in the secondary market. The actions are in their initial stage and the lead plaintiff and lead plaintiff's counsel have not been chosen. While RoweCom is investigating
the allegations in the lawsuits against it and its chief executive officer and former chief financial officer, RoweCom currently believes the allegations are without merit and intends to defend them
vigorously. If the plaintiffs are able to prove the allegations, however, the litigation could have a material adverse effect on RoweCom's financial condition and results of operations.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
  FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OF ROWECOM    

Overview  

    RoweCom is a leading business-to-business provider of high-quality service and e-commerce solutions for
purchasing and managing the acquisition of magazines, newspapers, journals and e-journals, books and other printed sources of commercial, scientific and general interest information and
analysis. RoweCom refers to these products as "knowledge resources." RoweCom offers its clients and their employees easy and convenient access to one of the largest catalogs of knowledge resources on
the Internet. RoweCom also provides businesses, academic and other non-profit institutions with a highly effective means of managing and controlling purchases of knowledge resources and
reducing costs. RoweCom's services fall into two main categories: library services and desktop services. RoweCom targets clients in knowledge-intense industries, such as business and financial
services; biomedical; academic and the federal government; and corporate and professional services. 

    RoweCom
began significant commercial operations in March 1996. RoweCom introduced the kStore in June 1997 for desktop purchases by employees of companies, but began to
significantly concentrate on library services as a result of its acquisition of Dawson's subscription business in October 1999. Since its inception, RoweCom has incurred significant net losses
and, as of June 30, 2001, had an accumulated deficit of $130.2 million. 

    RoweCom's
generates substantially all of its revenues from the sale of magazines, newspapers, journals, e-journals, books and other knowledge resources published by third
parties. RoweCom recognizes revenues from these sales when it places an order for knowledge resources with a publisher. The sales price of each knowledge resource reflects the cost to RoweCom of the
knowledge resource plus the fee retained by RoweCom. Prior to the fourth quarter of 1998, RoweCom only charged its clients a fixed transaction fee. RoweCom currently charges either a flat fee or a fee
equal to the difference between the price paid by the client and the publisher's discount price paid by RoweCom for the knowledge resource, or
a combination of the two. The amount of these discounts varies by transaction and client. Library service clients primarily pre-pay their orders several months in advance to secure early
payment discounts, or they are invoiced. RoweCom finances certain clients through seasonal lines of credit. At June 30, 2001, RoweCom had outstanding accounts receivable of
$52.1 million. 

    To date, RoweCom has generated a substantial majority of its revenues in the fourth quarter of each year, primarily because most subscriptions are purchased or renewed in that
quarter, with subscriptions generally beginning on January 1
st
 of each year. See "Selected Quarterly Results of Operations." As a result of the seasonal nature of
RoweCom's cash flows, RoweCom relies to a great extent on bank financing and lines of credit and other sources of liquidity to cover current expenses during the rest of the year. RoweCom believes that
desktop purchases by individual employees will increase as a percentage of its total revenues in the future. Therefore, RoweCom believes the seasonality described above will begin to decrease because
desktop purchases are generally made as required, and thus are more evenly distributed throughout the year. RoweCom's sales outside the United States accounted for approximately 42% and 51% of its
total revenues in 1999 and 2000, respectively.

    RoweCom's cost of revenues consists of the cost of the knowledge resources sold to its clients, which are variable. RoweCom recognizes its cost of revenues when it places an order for
knowledge resources with a publisher. RoweCom's sales and marketing, research and development and general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salary and benefits and are relatively fixed.
RoweCom expects these expenses to continue to decrease as it further realizes synergies from its various acquisitions and other cost-cutting measures. For example, RoweCom is in the
process of reducing expenses through a reduction in workforce and the closing of certain facilities. RoweCom plans to close its Oregon, Illinois facility by October 31, 2001 and sell the
facility. RoweCom also plans to reduce its workforce in its Folkestone, United Kingdom facility during the remainder of 2001 and is negotiating with a potential occupant to sublease its Cambridge,
Massachusetts facility. RoweCom's sales and operating results generally depend on the volume and timing of orders received, which are difficult to forecast. As a result, RoweCom may be unable to
adjust operating expenses in a timely manner to compensate for any unexpected fluctuation or shortfall in revenue or gross profit. Any significant shortfall in gross profit in relation to RoweCom's
fixed expenses would have an immediate adverse effect on RoweCom's results of operations. 

    RoweCom
has entered into several strategic relationships and intends to continue to enter into strategic relationships that will further increase content and add new distribution
channels. RoweCom expects that the terms of most strategic alliances will include some element of revenue sharing between the parties. See "Information Regarding RoweCom
Business StrategyDesktop ServicesDevelop Strategic Alliances." These strategic alliances have not generated material revenues to date and RoweCom does not expect these
alliances to generate material revenues in the short-term, if at all. 

 Acquisitions  

    In June 1999, RoweCom acquired all of the issued and outstanding capital stock of Corporate Subscription Services, Inc. for $5,923,000 in cash
and 16,260 shares of RoweCom's common stock, which were valued at approximately $250,000. 

    In
August 1999, RoweCom acquired all of the issued and outstanding capital stock of International Subscription Agencies Pty. Ltd. for $1,486,596 in cash. 

    On
October 4, 1999, pursuant to the terms of a purchase and sale agreement, dated as of September 16, 1999, between RoweCom, Dawson Holdings PLC and certain other
Dawson-affiliated entities, RoweCom acquired: 


all
of the issued and outstanding capital stock of Dawson, Inc., a Delaware corporation; and


certain
assets of United Kingdom-based Dawson Information Services Group relating to subscription services, a Web-based information searching
and retrieval tool, and library information management software and services. 

    The
acquired Dawson group included over 20,000 clients, 500 employees and operations in the following nine locations: Folkestone, United Kingdom; Paris, France; Madrid, Spain; London,
Ontario; Montreal, Quebec; Westwood, Massachusetts; Oregon, Illinois; Carlsbad, California; and Chantilly, Virginia. During 1999, RoweCom paid net consideration of $34.0 million in cash and
issued approximately 94,000 shares of RoweCom's common stock, which were valued at $1.7 million, and paid acquisition costs of $2.3 million, in connection 

with its acquisition of Dawson. RoweCom paid an additional $6.1 million of acquisition costs during 2000. Under the terms of the Dawson purchase agreement, RoweCom issued an additional 465,300
shares of RoweCom common stock in May 2000, at a price per share of approximately $22.98, totaling approximately $10.7 million as part of the purchase price for the acquisition, after
making an adjustment based upon profit calculations for the period from the completion of the acquisition to December 31, 1999. 

    In September 2001, RoweCom purchased the assets of MDLB Enterprises, L.L.C. (doing business as Doody Publishing), an online medical publisher of products for health care
professionals, in exchange for 600,000 shares of RoweCom common stock. Pursuant to the acquisition, RoweCom assumed up to $40,000 of accounts payable and accrued expenses of Doody Publishing, assumed
up to $30,000 of accrued salaries of Doody Publishing and paid up to $150,000 of closing expenses.

 Gross Margin  

    RoweCom's gross margin has increased in each of the past four years from 1.06% in 1996 to 8.94% for the year ended December 31, 2000. The gross margin
reflects: 


the
mix of products purchased by RoweCom's clients;


the
discount rates RoweCom is able to obtain from publishers; and


RoweCom's
pricing structure. 

    The
gross margin has primarily improved due to the fact that the companies acquired by RoweCom have historically shown higher gross margins than RoweCom. 

 Pricing  

    RoweCom generally purchases publications from publishers at a discount from the list price. These discounts vary widely from an average of 5% on
high-priced scientific, technical and medical publications, whose average selling price is hundreds of dollars, to 80% for lower-priced general interest and large circulation magazines,
whose average selling price is below $30. Until the fourth quarter of 1998, RoweCom's pricing strategy had been to pass the discount provided by the publisher on to the buyer and retain only a flat
fee for each subscription sold. This aggressive pricing strategy was aimed at gaining market share quickly and establishing the RoweCom brand, but led to lower than industry average gross margins. In
the first quarter of 1999, RoweCom began retaining a portion of the discounts it obtains from publishers on serials instead of passing such discounts on to customers, as it had done in the past.
RoweCom currently utilizes both pricing strategies. 

 Product Mix  

    RoweCom's library services team is focused on simplifying and enhancing the centralized purchasing process for librarians and knowledge managers and accounted
for approximately 99% and 98% of RoweCom's total revenues for the year ended December 31, 2000 and the six-months ended June 30, 2001, respectively. RoweCom's desktop
services facilitate decentralized purchasing of knowledge resources by businesses and their employees and accounted for approximately 1% and 2% of RoweCom's total revenues for the year ended
December 31, 2000 and the six months ended June 30, 2001, respectively. RoweCom believes that while library services will remain relatively stable, the desktop services will grow. 

RoweCom also believes that its focus on corporate desktop purchases will result in increased sales of lower-priced items on which RoweCom retains a higher percentage of the sales price. RoweCom's
store is specifically designed to allow decentralized desktop purchases with centralized approval and reporting. RoweCom expects that this feature, combined with favorable pricing on lower-priced
items and books, will increase sales of lower-priced knowledge resources. RoweCom has also begun to focus on e-procurement software, which is a far reaching generic solution that allows
purchasing organizations to automate their processing of transactions among their members and all the products or services offered within their organizations. Dedicated procurement software on the
users' desktops provide access to multiple suppliers' e-catalogs that are hosted by the company using the e-procurement software or linked through the Internet to the
suppliers' sites. Both kStore and kLibrary are custom procurement applications dedicated to the unique requirements of knowledge resource
service, acquisition and management. RoweCom has recognized an immaterial amount of revenue to date from e-procurement as it has only recently become an accredited supplier to
e-procurement software vendors. 

 Greater Discounts  

    RoweCom believes that by increasing its volume of sales, it can increase its buying power and possibly negotiate higher discounts from publishers on the
knowledge resources it sells. This would provide the opportunity for higher gross margins and improved pricing. Management cannot be certain, however, that RoweCom's sales volumes will continue to
increase or that RoweCom will be able to obtain greater discounts, or that any such changes will have a positive effect on RoweCom's gross margin. 

 Sales Tax  

    RoweCom does not currently collect sales or other similar taxes with respect to substantially all of its sales of products and services. RoweCom is currently
reviewing the necessity of collecting sales taxes on certain products and services sold through its desktop and library services. If one or more states or any foreign country were to require that
RoweCom collect sales or other taxes on the sale of books and subscriptions through RoweCom's system, it could have a material adverse effect on RoweCom's future results. In addition, any requirement
that RoweCom remit sales taxes for prior periods could have a material adverse effect on RoweCom's financial condition and results of operations. RoweCom is currently under audit for sales and use tax
compliance in Massachusetts and at this time is unable to determine the financial impact this audit may have on RoweCom, if any. 

Results of Operations  

 Six Months Ended June 30, 2001 Compared to the Six Months Ended June 30, 2000  

    Revenues.
  RoweCom's revenues for the six-month period ended June 30, 2001 were $149.3 million
as compared to $90.6 million for the six-month period ended June 30, 2000, an increase of $58.6 million or 65%. This increase resulted primarily from a
$52.3 million carryover of revenues from the fourth quarter of 2000. The $52.3 million carryover was due to the fact that RoweCom did not finalize its United States line of credit until
February 2001, which required RoweCom to defer to the first quarter of 2001 $52.3 million of revenues for customer orders placed with the publishers in the fourth quarter of 2000 because
RoweCom 

knew that it would not be able to pay the publishers for these orders without the line of credit. See "Year Ended December 31, 2000 Compared to Year Ended December 31,
1999- Revenues." RoweCom's revenues for the three-month period ended June 30, 2001 were $35.2 million, as compared to $38.9 million for the three-month period ended
June 30, 2000, a decrease of $3.6 million or 9%. This decrease resulted primarily from timing and a loss of clients from RoweCom's United States client base. The financial condition of
RoweCom's United States operations has deteriorated significantly due to the delay in the closing of its United States working capital line of credit for the fourth quarter 2000 ordering cycle. This
financial instability has lead to the loss of clients from the United States client base. RoweCom anticipates that revenues in its foreign subsidiaries will increase slightly over revenues from the
prior year through the end of 2001 while revenues for its operations in the United States will be comparable to the prior year or decrease for the remainder of 2001 due to client losses. Accordingly,
RoweCom anticipates that revenues for both the third and fourth quarters of 2001 will either approximate the prior years levels or be lower (in order to more accurately compare RoweCom's total
revenues for 2001 and 2000, RoweCom believes it is necessary to reclassify the $52.3 million of deferred revenues from the first quarter of 2001 to the fourth quarter of 2000). 

    Cost of Revenues.
  RoweCom's cost of revenues in the six-month period ended June 30, 2001 was
$136.1 million as compared to $82.2 million during the six-month period ended June 30, 2000, an increase of $53.9 million or 66%. $48.4 million in cost
of revenues was carried over from the last quarter of 2000, which was a result of the deferral of revenues of $52.3 million. As a percentage of revenues, cost of revenues was 91% during both
the six-month period ended June 30, 2001 and the six-month period ended June 30, 2000. RoweCom's cost of revenues in the three-month period ended June 30,
2001 was $31.6 million as compared to $34.8 million during the three-month period ended June 30, 2000, a decrease of $3.3 million or 9%. As a percentage of revenues, cost
of revenues was 90% during both the three-month period ended
June 30, 2001 and the three-month period ended June 30, 2000. RoweCom expects gross margin to continue at approximately the same level for the remainder of 2001. 

    Sales and Marketing.
  RoweCom's sales and marketing expenses decreased to $14.0 million during the
six-month period ended June 30, 2001 from $18.4 million in the six-month period ended June 30, 2000, a decrease of $4.5 million or 24%.
$2.2 million of the decrease was attributable to a decrease in personnel expenses, which decreased to approximately $9.0 million in the six-month period ended June 30,
2001 from $11.2 million in the six-month period ended June 30, 2000. RoweCom's sales and marketing expenses decreased to $7.0 million during the three-month period
ended June 30, 2001 from $9.7 million in the three-month period ended June 30, 2001, a decrease of $2.7 million or 28%. $1.6 million of the decrease was attributable
to a decrease in personnel expenses, which decreased to approximately $4.3 million in the three month-period ended June 30, 2001 from $5.9 million in the three-month period ended
June 30, 2000. These decreases in sales and marketing expenses were primarily due to synergies realized from the Dawson acquisition, including the consolidation of the sales and marketing
departments and the realignment of the focus of RoweCom's sales and marketing departments, and RoweCom's ongoing efforts to reduce costs that it began in the fourth quarter of 2000, including the
termination of its "distance selling program" and implementation of a cost containment program. 

    Research and Development.
  RoweCom's research and development expenses decreased to $3.6 million in the
six-month period ended June 30, 2001 from $5.9 million in the six-month period ended June 30, 2000, a decrease of $2.2 million or 38%. RoweCom's
research and development expenses decreased to $1.7 million in the three-month period ended June 30, 2001 from $2.9 million in the three-month period ended June 30, 2000, a
decrease of $1.2 million or 40%. These decreases were primarily a result of reductions in staff and a decrease in consulting expenses associated with the development of the kStore. 

    General and Administrative.
  RoweCom's general and administrative expenses decreased to $6.7 million in the
six-month period ended June 30, 2001 compared to $7.6 million in the six-month period ended June 30, 2000, a decrease of $888,000 or 12%. RoweCom's general
and administrative expenses increased to $3.5 million in the three-month period ended June 30, 2001 compared to $3.4 million in the three-month period ended June 30, 2000,
an increase of $87,000 or 3%. The decrease between the six-month periods was primarily attributed to reductions in staff and RoweCom's continuous efforts to lower overall expenses in these
areas. The increase between the three-month periods was primarily attributed to an increase in director's and officers' liability insurance premiums and costs associated with efforts to raise
additional capital, partially offset by overall reductions in expenses. 

    Amortization of Goodwill and Intangibles.
  RoweCom's amortization of goodwill and intangibles was $3.2 million in
the six-month period ended June 30, 2001 compared to $3.5 million in the six-month period ended June 30, 2000. RoweCom's amortization of goodwill and
intangibles was $2.0 million in the three-month period ended June 30, 2001 compared to $1.9 million in the three-month period ended June 30, 2000. Intangible assets were
written down to their fair value as a result of the charge for the impairment of intangible assets of $30.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2000. Thus, the reduced carrying value of the
intangible assets led to a decrease in amortization expense in the six-month period ended June 30, 2001 compared to the six-month period ended June 30, 2000. The
decrease in amortization of acquisition-related goodwill and intangible assets was partially offset by approximately $900,000 in amortization expense on deferred financing costs associated with the
United States line of credit. 

    Interest and Other Expense, Net.
  RoweCom's interest expense was $3.4 million in the six-month period
ended June 30, 2001, as compared to interest expense of $2.7 million in the six-month period ended June 30, 2000. RoweCom's interest expense was $1.3 million in
the three-month period ended June 30, 2001 as compared to interest expenses of $902,000 in the three-month period ended June 30, 2000. The first quarter of 2001 expense was primarily a
result of the amortization of the discount on certain debt financings, interest paid on the notes held by RAM Capital, and interest paid on the Fleet line of credit. The interest expense in the second
quarter of 2001 and the six-months ended June 30, 2000 were primarily a result of the interest paid on the working capital lines of credit and other loans. 

    Extraordinary Item.
  During June 2000, RoweCom redeemed $16.1 million of convertible notes. In connection
with this redemption, RoweCom recorded an extraordinary loss of $4.1 million, primarily attributable to a $1.1 million premium paid on the redemption and $2.7 million related to
the remaining unamortized debt issuance costs at the time of conversion. 

    Benefit/Provision for Income Taxes.
  RoweCom's benefit for income taxes was $878,000 for the six-month
period ended June 30, 2001 as compared to a provision for income taxes of $469,000 for the six-month period ended June 30, 2000. RoweCom's benefit for income taxes was
$514,000 for the three-month period ended June 30, 2001 as compared to a provision for income taxes of $249,000 for the three-month period ended June 30, 2000. The provision/benefit
recorded relates to RoweCom's foreign operations. 

 Year Ended December 31, 2000 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 1999  

    The results of operations for the year ended December 31, 1999 include only three months of revenues and expenses associated with the Dawson
Subscription Business due to the fact that the acquisition occurred in October 1999, whereas, the results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2000 includes a full year of
revenues and expenses associated with the acquired Dawson Subscription Business. 

    Revenues.
  RoweCom's revenues for the year ended December 31, 2000 were $347.6 million, as compared to
$307.6 million for the year ended December 31, 1999, an increase of $40.0 million or 13%. Transaction volume for the year ended December 31, 2000 also increased
significantly by 21% from the year ended December 31, 1999 from 1.4 million to 1.7 million transactions. The increase in revenue was seen throughout all of RoweCom's geographic
regions, including North America, France, the United Kingdom, and all other international subsidiaries, and resulted primarily from growth in RoweCom's client base, particularly related to the
acquisition of Dawson. During 2000, RoweCom had difficulty in obtaining lines of credit to support its United States operation due to RoweCom's deteriorating credit condition. As a result, RoweCom did
not finalize its United States line of credit until February 2001, which required a deferral of revenues of $52.3 million. RoweCom placed the customer orders with the publishers in the
fourth quarter of 2001, knew that it would not be able to pay the publishers for these orders without the line of credit, and sent the corresponding payments to the publishers immediately upon
obtaining the line of credit. The $52.3 million in revenues deferred during the fourth quarter of 2000 were therefore recorded during the first quarter of 2001. No material disruptions to
client service occurred as a result of this deferral. The majority of RoweCom's fourth quarter orders were comprised of renewals and not new orders. Therefore, most clients continued to receive their
subscriptions and did not experience any disruption in service. 

    Cost of Revenues.
  RoweCom's cost of revenues in the year ended December 31, 2000 were $316.5 million as
compared to $286.9 million during the year ended December 31, 1999, an increase of $29.6 million or 10%. As a percentage of revenues, cost of revenues decreased to 91% during the
year ended December 31, 2000 as compared to 93% in the year ended December 31, 1999. This improvement was primarily due to the fact that the acquired Dawson Subscription Business had
more favorable margins than the rest of RoweCom's business. 

    Sales and Marketing.
  RoweCom's sales and marketing expenses increased to $34.5 million during the year ended
December 31, 2000 from $16.8 million in the year ended December 31, 1999, an increase of $17.7 million or 105%. This growth was primarily due to an increase of personnel as
a result of the Dawson acquisition. Personnel expenses increased to approximately $21.2 million in the year ended December 31, 2000 from $10.2 million in the year ended
December 31, 1999. Sales and marketing expenses decreased sequentially during 

each of last three quarters of the year ended December 31, 2000 primarily due to synergies realized from the Dawson acquisition, including the consolidation of the sales and marketing
departments and the realignment of the focus of RoweCom's sales and marketing departments and RoweCom's efforts to reduce costs begun in the fourth quarter of 2000, including termination of its
"distance selling program" and implementation of a cost containment program. 

    Research and Development.
  RoweCom's research and development expenses increased to $9.9 million in the year
ended December 31, 2000 from $5.4 million in the year ended December 31, 1999, an increase of $4.5 million or 84%, primarily as a result of costs incurred in an effort to: 


integrate
new content into RoweCom's catalog;


enhance
the user interface and functionality of the kStore and kLibrary;


develop
services designed to process information using standard EDI transactions, as defined for the serials and periodicals industry; and


create
XML transactions to interface with other leading e-commerce providers. 

Research
and development expenses decreased each quarter during the year ended December 31, 2000, mainly due to reductions in staff. 

    General and Administrative.
  RoweCom's general and administrative expenses increased to $13.9 million in the year
ended December 31, 2000 compared to $9.5 million in the year ended December 31, 1999, an increase of $4.4 million or 47%. This increase was primarily attributed to growth
in average headcount in the administrative, finance and human resources departments related to the Dawson acquisition. General and administrative expenses
decreased each quarter during the year ended December 31, 2000. This was attributed to reductions in staff and continuous efforts made to lower overall expenses in these areas. 

    Amortization of Goodwill and Intangibles.
  RoweCom's goodwill amortization was $8.9 million in the year ended
December 31, 2000 compared to $2.7 million in the year ended December 31, 1999. As a result of the acquisitions of Corporate Subscription Services, Inc., International
Subscription Agencies Pty. Ltd., and Dawson's Subscription Business, approximately $56.0 million in goodwill and intangibles were recorded and are being amortized over a range of 3 to
10 years from the date of these acquisitions. 

    Charge for Impairment of Intangible Assets.
  During the fourth quarter of 2000, RoweCom identified certain factors
suggesting that the carrying value of certain long-lived assets may be impaired. These factors included a significant decline in the market value of RoweCom's common stock price relative
to the stock price at the time of the acquisition of the Dawson Subscription Business and current period losses combined with a decline in the projected revenues and cash flows of the Dawson business.
RoweCom's current estimates of the undiscounted future cash flows of the Dawson Subscription Business were not sufficient to cover the carrying amount of the intangible assets for the United States
and Canadian operations. As a result, these long-lived assets were written down to their fair value, estimated using a discounted cash flow analysis at the geographic operating entity
level, resulting in an intangible asset impairment charge of $30.1 million. The charge was determined by assessing the fair value of the intangible assets relative to the carrying value of the
intangibles. The 

remaining intangible assets are amortized over their remaining estimated useful lives. RoweCom expects amortization to approximate $1.6 million per year through 2010. The impairment charge did
not result in a reduction to the carrying value of property and equipment. Prior to the fourth quarter of 2000, RoweCom believed that the value of the Dawson intangibles was consistent with the values
assigned at the time of the acquisition. 

    Interest and Other Income (Expense), Net.
  RoweCom's interest expense was $5.4 million for the year ended
December 31, 2000 as compared to interest income of $600,000 for the year ended December 31, 1999. This 2000 interest expense was primarily a result of the amortization of the discount
related to certain debt financings and interest paid on the notes held by Promethean and RAM Capital, and the promissory notes issued in May 2000. The discount resulted primarily from warrants
issued to debt holders and certain embedded beneficial conversion features. 

    Provision for Income Taxes.
  RoweCom's provision for income taxes for the year ended December 31, 2000 was
$3.7 million as compared to $1.5 million for the year ended December 31, 1999. The provision was recorded to provide for taxes on RoweCom's profitable entities located in foreign
jurisdictions. 

    Extraordinary Item.
  During June 2000, RoweCom redeemed $16.1 million of convertible notes. In connection
with this redemption, RoweCom recorded an extraordinary loss of $4.1 million, primarily attributable to a $1.1 million premium paid on the redemption and $2.7 million related to
the remaining unamortized debt issuance costs at the time of conversion. During October 2000, RoweCom recorded an additional extraordinary loss of $2.2 million incurred in connection
with the extension of the maturity date on certain of its $6.2 million promissory notes issued in May 2000. 

    Cumulative Effect of Change in Accounting Principle.
  During November 2000, the Emerging Issues Task Force
reached a consensus on EITF 00-27, "Application of Issue No. 98-5 to Certain Convertible Instruments," regarding the accounting for securities with beneficial conversion
features. EITF 00-27 requires the use of the effective conversion value, which is the amount allocated to the convertible instrument based on the relative fair values of each financial
instrument issued, to compute the intrinsic value (defined as the amount by which the market price of the underlying stock exceeds the conversion price), if any, of an embedded conversion feature.
Historically, RoweCom calculated the intrinsic value of an embedded conversion feature using the specified conversion price stated in the instrument. EITF 00-27 requires retroactive
application for all transactions entered into prior to November 16, 2000. During the fourth quarter of 2000, RoweCom adopted the provisions of EITF 00-27 which was reported as a
cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle. The cumulative effect of the change in accounting principle resulted in a charge to operations of $2.5 million or $0.21 per share. 

 Year Ended December 31, 1999 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 1998  

    Revenues.
  RoweCom's revenues for the year ended December 31, 1999 were $307.6 million as compared to
$19.1 million for the year ended December 31, 1998, an increase of $288.6 million or 1,511%. This increase resulted primarily from increased sales per client and growth in
RoweCom's client base, particularly related to the acquisition of Dawson. Transaction volumes for the year ended December 31, 1999 also increased significantly by 

2,888% from the year ended December 31, 1998 from 48,000 to 1.4 million transactions, primarily due to volume increases related to the Dawson acquisition. The average selling price per
transaction for the year ended December 31, 1999 was $214 as compared to $396 during the year ended December 31, 1998. 

    Cost of Revenues.
  RoweCom's cost of revenues in the year ended December 31, 1999 was $286.9 million as
compared to $18.7 million during the year ended December 31, 1998, an increase of $268.1 million or 1,431%. As a percentage of revenues, cost of revenues decreased to 93% during
the year ended December 31, 1999 as compared to 98% in the year ended December 31, 1998. This improvement was primarily due to the clients added by the Dawson acquisition. Installation
revenue was $181,000 during the year ended December 31, 1999 and $41,000 during the year ended December 31, 1998. 

    Sales and Marketing.
  RoweCom's sales and marketing expenses increased to $16.8 million during the year ended
December 31, 1999 from $4.8 million in the year ended December 31, 1998, an increase of $12.0 million or 250%. This growth was primarily due to an increase of personnel and
the associated expenses of recruiting, hiring, and training the additional personnel. Personnel expenses increased to approximately $10.2 million in the year ended December 31, 1999 from
$1.9 million in the year ended December 31, 1998. In addition, during the year ended December 31, 1999, RoweCom incurred approximately $1.6 million in advertising costs,
which included the announcement of the Dawson acquisition. 

    Research and Development.
  RoweCom's research and development expenses increased to $5.4 million in the year
ended December 31, 1999 from $1.6 million in the year ended December 31, 1998, an increase of $3.7 million or 231%, primarily as a result of increased staffing and
associated costs incurred in an effort to integrate new content into RoweCom's catalog, to enhance the user interface and functionality of the kStore, and to develop the transaction processing
systems. Consulting fees in connection with these improvements increased to $734,000 during the year ended December 31, 1999 from $376,000 in the year ended December 31, 1998. 

    General and Administrative.
  RoweCom's general and administrative expenses increased to $9.5 million in the year
ended December 31, 1999 compared to $1.6 million in the year ended December 31, 1998, an increase of $7.9 million or 494%. This increase was primarily attributed to growth
in average headcount in the administrative, finance and human resources departments. RoweCom also incurred additional costs in its operation as a newly public company, including insurance, investor
relations and accounting fees that resulted in an overall increase in expenses of $834,000 for the year ended December 31, 1999. 

    Stock-based Compensation.
  RoweCom's stock-based compensation was $519,000 in the year ended December 31, 1999.
Under an agreement among certain of RoweCom's stockholders, Working Ventures' Canadian Fund, Inc. was required to transfer an aggregate of 310,371 shares of common stock to RoweCom for transfer
to certain other stockholders and optionholders of RoweCom if Working Ventures' initial investment increased by 45% or more, on an annually compounded basis, and it was not legally restricted from
selling these shares. As a result of the expiration of the initial public offering's lock-up period on September 5, 1999, these conditions were satisfied and RoweCom was required to
record a compensation charge equal to the aggregate fair market value of the common stock transferred by Working 

Ventures and eventually received by RoweCom option and warrant holders who were eligible to receive such shares as described above. 

    Goodwill Amortization.
  RoweCom's goodwill amortization was $2.7 million in the year ended December 31,
1999. As a result of the acquisitions of Corporate Subscription Services, Inc. and International Subscription Agencies Pty. Ltd., approximately $9.1 million in goodwill was
recorded and is being amortized over a thirty-six-month period from the date of the acquisitions. 

Selected Quarterly Results of Operations  

    The following table shows, for the periods indicated, RoweCom's quarterly results of operations. RoweCom has derived this statement of operations data from its

Liquidity and Capital Resources  

    RoweCom incurred a net loss of $16.9 million for the six-month period ended June 30, 2001. As of June 30, 2001, RoweCom had
cash and cash equivalents of $5.7 million, a working capital deficit of $41.6 million, $31.9 million of seasonal short-term debt and long-term liabilities
of $1.8 million. These factors raise substantial doubt about RoweCom's ability to continue as a going concern. RoweCom's financial statements are presented on a going concern basis that
contemplate the realization of assets and satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business and do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability in classification of recorded
asset amounts or to the amounts in classification of liabilities that may be necessary if RoweCom is unable to continue as a going concern. RoweCom believes its continuation as a going concern is
dependent upon the completion of this merger. 

    If
we do not complete this merger, RoweCom's current cash and existing credit facilities would not be sufficient beyond December 2001. RoweCom has not been able to secure any
additional equity investments to date and does not feel that it could secure all required working capital lines of credit in time for the fourth quarter ordering season, unless we complete this
merger. Should the acquisition of RoweCom by divine not be successfully completed, RoweCom's management would consider the following actions or combination of actions, among other possibilities:
(1) negotiate extended payment terms on existing debt and other liabilities; (2) seek another purchaser for RoweCom; and/or (3) file for bankruptcy protection. 

    Net
cash used in operating activities was $18.2 million for the six-month period ended June 30, 2001 as compared to $47.1 million of cash provided for
the six-month period ended June 30, 2001. Cash used in the six-month period ended June 30, 2001 resulted primarily from a net loss of $16.9 million, a
decrease in accounts payable of $29.6 million, and an $8.1 million decrease in customer advances, partially offset by a decrease in accounts receivable of $38.7 million. Cash
provided for the six-month period ended June 30, 2000 resulted primarily from a decrease in accounts receivable of $82.7 million and an increase in 

deferred revenue of $13.3 million. This was partially offset by a net loss of $34.2 million and a $24.9 million decrease in accounts payable.

    Net
cash provided by operating activities was $42.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2000 as compared to net cash used in operating activities of
$111.9 million for the year ended December 31, 1999. Cash provided for the year ended December 31, 2000 resulted primarily
from a net loss of $84.0 million, adjusted for non-cash expenses of approximately $54.6 million. The significant changes in operating assets and liabilities that provided
cash included an increase in deferred revenue and customer advances of $20.6 million, an $11.5 million increase in accounts payable, and a decrease in accounts receivable of
$40.5 million. Cash used in operating activities for the year ended December 31, 1999 was primarily attributable to a net loss of $15.0 million, an increase in accounts receivable
of $80.5 million, and a $71.6 million decrease in deferred revenues. 

    Net
cash used in investing activities for the six-month period ended June 30, 2001 was $942,000, as compared to $2.4 million for the six-month
period ended June 30, 2000. Substantially all of the cash used in both periods was for the purchase of property and equipment. 

    Net
cash used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2000 was $9.2 million as compared to $6.8 million for the year ended December 31,
1999. Cash used for the purchase of property and equipment was $3.2 million and cash used in finalizing the acquisitions of Corporate Subscription Services, Inc. and Dawson's
Subscription Business was $6.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2000. Cash used for the acquisition of Corporate Subscription Services, Inc., International Subscription
Agencies Pty. Ltd. and Dawson's Subscription Business net of cash acquired, was $5.1 million for the year ended December 31, 1999. 

    Net
cash used in financing activities was $1.9 million for the six-month period ended June 30, 2001, as compared to cash used in financing activities of
$48.2 million for the six-month period ended June 30, 2000. Loan repayments were $83.9 million, offset by loan proceeds of $81.9 million. During the
six-month period ended June 30, 2000, repayments on loans were $101.4 million, offset by loan proceeds of $53.2 million. 

    Net
cash used in financing activities was $21.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2000, as compared to net cash provided by financing activities of
$115.3 million for the year ended December 31, 1999. Proceeds from loans were $88.2 million and loan repayments were $113.9 million for the year ended December 31,
2000. In December 2000, RoweCom entered into an agreement for the sale and subsequent lease-back of its Westwood, Massachusetts, facility. Under the terms of the agreement, RoweCom
received cash proceeds of approximately $4.2 million on the sale and also entered into a seven year lease agreement with annual rent payments of approximately $585,000. During the year ended
December 31, 1999, proceeds from RoweCom's initial public offering, net of underwriting discounts and offering costs, were $51.6 million, proceeds from loans were $41.2 million,
proceeds from the issuance of convertible debt, net of offering costs, was $19.2 million. Prior to the initial public offering, RoweCom financed its operations primarily through sales of its
equity securities in private placements. At December 31, 2000, RoweCom had cash and cash equivalents of $26.6 million, a working capital deficit of $24.9 million, debt of
$35.1 million, of which $6.1 million was long-term, and stockholders' deficit of $1.8 million. 

 Revolving Lines of Credit and Senior Secured Notes  

    On August 1, 2001, RoweCom REALA, a wholly-owned subsidiary of RoweCom, received loans in the amount of (euro) 7.6 million (approximately
$6.7 million at August 1, 2001) from Credit Lyonnais, Banque Nationale de Paris, and Banque Populare Region Quest de Paris. Proceeds from the loans were used to pay off RoweCom France,
S.A.S.'s extensions on its existing lines of credit for the amount of (euro) 4.0 million ($3.7 million) on July 31, 2001. The remaining loan proceeds of (euro) 3.6 million
($3.2 million) were used to pay down bank overdraft balances. The loans mature on July 31, 2005. The interest rate for the loans is the three month EURIBOR rate + 1.6%
(6.05% at August 1, 2001). The loans are collateralized by 100% of the outstanding stock of RoweCom REALA. RoweCom REALA is the parent company of RoweCom France S.A.S., which is the parent
company of RoweCom UK Limited, Rowe Communications Espana, S.L., RoweCom Korea, Inc., RoweCom Faxon Taiwan-Hong Kong and RoweCom Australia Pty. Ltd.

    On
March 9, 2001, RoweCom France, S.A.S., a wholly-owned subsidiary of RoweCom, received extensions on the existing lines of credit in France, for a total of (euro)
4.0 million ($3.7 million) from Credit Lyonnais, Banque Nationale de Paris, Barclays Bank, and Banque Populare Region Quest de Paris in order to pay off the Montrose
Investments Ltd. $4.0 million convertible debenture. The loans matured on April 30, 2001. Interest rates ranged from EURIBOR plus .45% to EURIBOR plus .60%. The extensions were
collateralized by 60% of the outstanding stock of RoweCom France, S.A.S., RoweCom UK Limited, RoweCom Espana S.L., RoweCom Australia Pty. Ltd., RoweCom Korea, Inc., and RoweCom Faxon
Taiwan-Hong Kong, all of which are wholly-owned subsidiaries of RoweCom. On April 30, 2001, the due date was extended to May 31, 2001. On May 31, 2001, the due date
was extended to July 31, 2001. On August 1, 2001, the extensions on the existing lines of credit in the amount of (euro) 4.0 million ($3.7 million) were paid in full with a
portion of the proceeds from the (euro) 7.6 million ($6.7 million) loan that RoweCom REALA received on August 1, 2001. 

    In
February 2001, RoweCom obtained a $25.0 million line of credit for its United States subsidiaries with Fleet Capital. The line of credit was collateralized by the
receivables of RoweCom's United States operating subsidiaries and certain other assets. The line of credit bore interest at the rate of prime plus 2% and expired on May 31, 2001. This line was
paid in full as of April 4, 2001. 

    In
January 2001, RoweCom issued $9.0 million in floating rate senior secured notes to several suppliers. The notes are due on December 28, 2001, and interest is
payable upon maturity of the notes at a rate of prime plus 1%. The notes are subordinated to all revolving lines of credit of RoweCom and are collateralized by substantially all of RoweCom's trade
accounts receivables and certain other assets. Outstanding borrowings at June 30, 2001 were $9.0 million. RoweCom is currently in violation of several covenants in the senior secured
notes. Accordingly, the senior secured notes are due on demand, if so called by the suppliers. 

    In November 2000, RoweCom's wholly-owned French subsidiary established a line of credit that permitted a maximum borrowing capacity as follows: 98.0 million French
Francs through and including April 30, 2001; 52.0 million French Francs from May 1, 2001 through and including June 30, 2001; and 13.0 million French Francs from
July 1, 2001 through and including August 31, 2001. Borrowing under the facility was limited to 100% of the subsidiary's accounts receivable, and accrued interest at the rate of EURIBOR
(4.41% at

June 30, 2001) plus 0.55%. The line of credit also provided for a 10.0 million French Franc daily overdraft and expired on August 31, 2001. Outstanding borrowings at
August 31, 2001 were converted to daily overdraft. The daily overdraft balance as of September 7, 2001 was $4.0 million.

    In November 2000, RoweCom's wholly-owned French subsidiary established a line of credit that permitted a maximum borrowing capacity as follows: 82.0 million French
Francs through and including April 15, 2001; 60.0 million French Francs from April 16, 2001 through and including June 15, 2001; and 15.0 million French Francs from
June 16, 2001 through and including July 31, 2001. Borrowing under the facility was limited to 120% of the subsidiary's accounts receivable, and accrued interest at the rate of EURIBOR
(4.41% at June 30, 2001) or a minimum of 5.75% plus 0.55%. The line of credit also provided for a 5.0 million French Franc daily overdraft and expired on July 31, 2001.
Outstanding borrowings at July 31, 2001 were converted to daily overdraft. The daily overdraft balance as of September 7, 2001 was $2.6 million.

    In November 2000, RoweCom's wholly-owned French subsidiary established a line of credit that permitted a maximum borrowing capacity as follows: 100.0 million French
Francs through and including March 31, 2001; 55.0 million French Francs from April 1, 2001 through and including May 31, 2001; and 13.0 million French Francs from
June 1, 2001 through and including July 31, 2001. Borrowing under the facility was limited to 100% of the subsidiary's accounts receivable, and accrued interest at the rate of EURIBOR
(4.41% at June 30, 2001) plus 0.50%. The line of credit also provided for a 5.0 million French Franc daily overdraft and

expired on July 31, 2001. Outstanding borrowings at July 31, 2001 were converted to daily overdraft. The daily overdraft balance as of September 7, 2001 was $1.9 million.

    In November 2000, RoweCom's wholly-owned French subsidiary established a line of credit for 45.0 million French Francs. Borrowing under the facility was limited to 100%
of the subsidiary's accounts receivable invoices greater than or equal to 1.0 million French Francs, and accrued interest at the rate of EURIBOR (4.41% at June 30, 2001) plus 0.50%. The
line of credit also provided for a 5.0 million French Franc daily overdraft and expired on March 31, 2001. Outstanding borrowings as of March 31, 2001 were converted to daily overdraft.
The daily overdraft balance as of September 7, 2001 was $780,000.

    In October 1999, RoweCom's wholly-owned United Kingdom subsidiary entered into a revolving line of credit for up to (pound)3.0 million. The line of credit was
collateralized by the subsidiary's accounts receivable. In addition, RoweCom guaranteed the loan up to an aggregate of (pound)5.4 million. The line of credit was available to the borrower until
April 2, 2000 and bore interest at the rate of the bank's base rate, LIBOR (3.21% at December 31, 1999) plus 1%. In May 2000, the revolving line of credit was renewed for one year
and increased to up to (pound)4.5 million bearing interest at the rate of the bank's base rate, LIBOR (4.46% at June 30, 2001). In June 2001, the line of credit was extended until
August 31, 2001. In August 2001, the line of credit was further extended until September 30, 2001. As of September 7, 2001, outstanding borrowings were approximately
(pound)323,324 ($471,100).

Euro Currency Issues  

    Effective January 1, 1999, eleven of the fifteen member countries of the European Union established fixed conversion rates between their existing
currencies and one common currency 

(the "euro"). The euro trades on currency exchanges and is used in business transactions. Beginning in January 2002, bills and coins denominated in the euro will be issued and existing
currencies will be withdrawn from circulation. RoweCom foreign subsidiaries are transacting a material portion of their business in the euro during fiscal 2001. Also, RoweCom's foreign subsidiaries
are not yet required to prepare reports to local regulatory agencies using the euro. IT systems used by RoweCom's foreign subsidiaries have been repaired and replaced in order to facilitate business
transactions and reporting to local government agencies. Costs to repair and/or replace IT systems were not material. 

Exchange Rate Risk Management  

    RoweCom enters into forward currency contracts primarily in European, Australian, and Canadian currencies to hedge its foreign currency exposures. Forward
currency contracts have maturities of less than one year. These contracts are used to reduce RoweCom's risk associated with exchange rate movements, as gains and losses on these contracts are intended
to offset exchange losses and gains on underlying exposures. RoweCom does not engage in currency speculation. At June 30, 2001, the face amount of outstanding forward currency contracts to buy
and sell United States dollars and British pound sterling for non-U.S. currencies was not material. 

Interest Rate Risk Management  

    Due to its short-term duration,the fair value of RoweCom's borrowings at June 30, 2001 approximated carrying value. Interest rate risk was
estimated as the potential increase in fair value resulting from a hypothetical 10% increase in interest rates. The resulting hypothetical change was approximately $68,000 in incremental interest
expense over the term of the debt. 

Recent Accounting Pronouncements  

    In June 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board approved Statement of Financial Accounting Standard ("SFAS") No. 141, "Business
Combinations," and SFAS No. 142, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets." SFAS No. 141 prospectively prohibits the pooling of interest method of accounting for business combinations
initiated after June 30, 2001. SFAS No. 142 requires companies to cease amortizing goodwill that existed at June 30, 2001. This amortization of existing goodwill will cease on
December 31, 2001. Any goodwill resulting from acquisitions completed after June 30, 2001 will not be amortized. SFAS No. 142 also establishes a new method of testing goodwill for
impairment on an annual basis or on an interim basis if an event occurs or circumstances change that would reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value. The adoption of SFAS
No. 142 will result in RoweCom's discontinuation of amortization of goodwill; however, RoweCom will be required to test its goodwill for impairment under the new standard beginning in the first
quarter of 2002, which could have an adverse effect on its future results of operations if an impairment occurs.

COMPARISON OF STOCKHOLDERS' RIGHTS    

    The rights of divine and RoweCom stockholders are currently governed by the Delaware General Corporation Law, the respective certificates of incorporation and
bylaws of divine and RoweCom, and, for divine stockholders, divine's stockholders' rights plan. In connection with the merger, the RoweCom stockholders will be exchanging their shares of RoweCom
common stock for shares of divine common stock and will become subject to the divine certificate of incorporation, bylaws and stockholders' rights plans, which differ from the RoweCom certificate or
incorporation and bylaws in several respects. Because of these differences, the rights of a holder of divine common stock differ from the rights of a holder of RoweCom common stock. 

    Below
is a comparison of some of the important provisions in the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of divine and RoweCom and a description of divine's stockholders' rights plan.
It is not practical to summarize all of these provisions in this proxy statement/prospectus, but the principal differences that could materially affect the rights of stockholders include the
following: 

AUTHORIZED CAPITAL STOCK

divine

RoweCom

divine's certificate of incorporation authorizes divine to issue 2,650,500,000 shares of capital stock, with a par value of $0.001 per share, of which:

 2,500,000,000 are designated class A common stock;

 100,000,000 are designated class C common stock;

 50,000,000 are designated preferred stock; and

 500,000 are designated series A junior participating preferred stock.

As of September 10, 2001, there were:

 164,124,076 shares of class A common stock issued and outstanding;

 no shares of class C common stock issued and outstanding; and

 no shares of preferred stock, including series A junior participating preferred stock, issued and outstanding.

RoweCom's certificate of incorporation authorizes RoweCom to issue 57,000,000 shares of capital stock, with a par value of $0.01 per share, of which:

 34,000,000 are designated common stock; and

 23,000,000 are designated preferred stock.

As of September 10, 2001, there were:

 13,552,745 shares of common stock issued and outstanding; and

 no shares of preferred stock issued and outstanding.

DIVIDENDS

divine

RoweCom

Holders of class A and class C common stock will be entitled to receive dividends or other distributions when and if declared by the divine board of directors.

Holders of the common stock are entitled to receive dividends payable in cash or stock when and if declared by the RoweCom board of directors.

VOTING RIGHTS

divine

RoweCom

Holders of class A common stock have the right to cast one vote for each share they hold of record on all matters on which stockholders of divine are generally entitled to vote.

Holders of common stock are entitled to one vote for each share of common stock held.

Holders of class C common stock do not have any voting rights, except as may be required by Delaware law.

Any stockholder entitled to vote at any meeting of stockholders may vote either in person or by duly authorized proxy, but no proxy dated more than three years prior to the meeting at which it is offered will
confer the right to vote unless the proxy provides that it will be effective for a longer period.

Same

CUMULATIVE VOTING

divine

RoweCom

Holders of common stock may not cumulate their votes for the election of directors.

Same

STOCKHOLDER ACTION

divine

RoweCom

At all stockholders meetings, a majority of the stock issued and outstanding and entitled to vote thereat, present in person or represented by proxy, will constitute a quorum requisite for the transaction of
business.

Same

Except as otherwise required by Delaware corporate law, in all matters other than the election of the directors, the affirmative vote of a majority of shares entitled to vote on such matter will be the act of
the stockholders. For the election of directors, a plurality of shares entitled to vote on the matter will be the act of the stockholders.

Same

STOCKHOLDERS' RIGHTS PLAN

divine

RoweCom

Pursuant to a stockholders' rights plan between divine and the rights agent and adopted by the divine board in 2001, for each outstanding share of divine common stock, a dividend of one right was issued.

RoweCom has not adopted a stockholders' rights plan.

 Each right certificate entitles its holder to purchase 1/1,000
th
 of a share of divine series A junior participating preferred stock for $15.00 per right.

 The rights are not exercisable unless a person or group has acquired, or announces the intent to acquire, 15% or more of divine's common stock (20% or more if such a person or group owned 10% or more of divine's common stock at the time
of the plan's adoption).

 The rights, once exercisable, entitle the holder to purchase, for the exercise price of the rights, the number of shares of divine common stock having a market value of two times the exercise price of the rights.

 Alternatively, if the rights have become exercisable and divine is acquired in a merger or other business combination, or 50% or more of its assets, cash flow or earning power are sold, each right will entitle the holder to purchase, for
the exercise price of the right, the number of shares of the acquiring company's common stock that, at the time of the transaction, have a market value of two times the exercise price of the right.

SPECIAL STOCKHOLDERS MEETINGS

divine

RoweCom

EXPERTS    

    The consolidated financial statements and financial statement schedule of divine as of December 31, 2000 and 1999, and for the year ended
December 31, 2000 and the period from May 7, 1999 (inception) through December 31, 1999, have been audited by KPMG LLP, independent certified public accountants, as set forth in
their reports with respect to these consolidated financial statements and financial statement schedule. These consolidated financial statements and financial statement schedule are incorporated by
reference in this proxy statement/prospectus in reliance upon the reports given and upon the authority of said firm as experts in accounting and auditing.

    The
consolidated financial statements of RoweCom as of December 31, 2000 and 1999 and for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2000 included in this
proxy statement/prospectus have been so included in reliance upon the report (which contains an explanatory paragraph relating to RoweCom's ability to continue as a going concern as described in
Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements) of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, independent accountants, given on the authority of said firm as experts in accounting and auditing. 

STOCKHOLDER PROPOSALS    

    Pursuant to Rule 14a-8 under the Exchange Act, stockholders may present proper proposals for inclusion in RoweCom's proxy statement and for
consideration at the next annual meeting of its stockholders by submitting their proposals to RoweCom in a timely manner. 

    As
a result of the merger, RoweCom does not anticipate holding its 2002 annual meeting of stockholders. If the meeting is held, any stockholder proposals must be submitted in writing
to the secretary of RoweCom at RoweCom's executive offices located at 15 Southwest Park, Westwood, Massachusetts 02090, on or before November 25, 2001. Stockholders interested in submitting
such a proposal are advised to contact knowledgeable counsel with regard to the detailed requirements of applicable securities laws. Receipt by RoweCom of any such proposal from a qualified
stockholder in a timely manner will not ensure its inclusion in the proxy material because there are other requirements in the proxy rules for such inclusions. 

    Alternatively,
a proposal or a nomination that the stockholder does not seek to include in the company's proxy statement pursuant to Rule 14a-8 may be submitted in
writing to the Secretary of RoweCom for the 2002 annual stockholders' meeting not less than 45 days or more than 120 days prior to the anniversary of the date on which RoweCom first
mailed its proxy materials for the 2001 annual meeting, unless the date of the 2002 annual meeting is 

advanced by more than 30 days or delayed (other than as a result of adjournment) by more than 30 days from the anniversary of the 2001 annual meeting. For RoweCom's 2002 annual meeting, this means
that any such proposal or nomination must be submitted no earlier than December 15, 2001. If the date of the 2002 annual meeting is advanced by more than 30 days or delayed (other than as a
result of adjournment) by more than 30 days from the anniversary of the 2001 annual meeting, the stockholder must submit any such proposal or nomination no later than the close of business on the
later of the 60th day prior to the 2002 annual meeting or the 10th day following the day on which public announcement of the date of such meeting is first made.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT ACCOUNTANTS  

To
the Board of Directors and Stockholders of RoweCom Inc.: 

    In
our opinion, the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and the related consolidated statements of operations, of stockholders' (deficit) equity and of cash flows present fairly,
in all material respects, the financial position of RoweCom Inc. and its subsidiaries at December 31, 1999 and 2000, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of
the three years in the period ended December 31, 2000 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. These financial statements are the
responsibility of the Company's management; our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits. We conducted our audits of these statements in accordance
with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America, which require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are
free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and
significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. 

    As
discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, during the year ended December 31, 2000 the Company changed its method of accounting for securities with
beneficial conversion features as a result of the issuance of Emerging Issues Task Force Issue No. 00-27, "Application of Issue No. 98-5 to Certain Convertible Instruments." 

    The
accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated
financial statements, the Company has suffered recurring losses from operations, has a working capital deficit and has a net capital deficiency that raise substantial doubt about its ability to
continue as a going concern. Management's plans in regard to these matters are also
described in Note 1. The consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.
