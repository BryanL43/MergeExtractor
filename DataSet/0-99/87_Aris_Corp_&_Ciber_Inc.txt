                     QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS ABOUT THE MERGER

Q:                      Why are CIBER and ARIS combining businesses?

A:                      The boards of directors of CIBER and ARIS have determined
                        that a combined company has the potential to realize a
                        stronger competitive position and to achieve improved
                        long-term operating and financial results. In particular, we
                        believe the merger will provide CIBER and ARIS with the
                        opportunity to:

                        -  offer a combination of information technology services to
                        better serve the needs of customers;

                        -  provide greater geographic coverage for existing and new
                           customers;

                        -  provide greater corporate cost saving synergies; and

                        -  provide ARIS shareholders with CIBER shares that offer
                        better liquidity based on the historical trading volume of
                           CIBER and ARIS shares.

Q:                      When and where is the special shareholders' meeting being
                        held and what specific proposals will I be asked to
                        consider?

A:                      The ARIS special shareholders' meeting will take place on
                        [meeting date] at the corporate offices of ARIS. At the
                        special meeting, ARIS shareholders will be asked to adopt
                        the merger agreement and approve the merger of ARIS with and
                        into CIBER. Following the merger, ARIS shareholders will
                        become shareholders of CIBER, and ARIS will no longer exist
                        as a separate entity.

                        The ARIS board of directors recommends voting in favor of
                        this proposal.

                        In addition, ARIS shareholders may be asked to vote on any
                        other matters that properly come before the meeting.

Q:                      What will I receive in the merger?

A:                      If the merger is completed, you will receive $1.30 in cash
                        and .220 of one share of CIBER common stock for each share
                        of ARIS common stock that you own at the time of the merger
                        (subject to adjustment as provided in the merger agreement).
                        You will not receive any fractional shares of CIBER common
                        stock in the merger, but instead will receive a cash payment
                        as determined under the merger agreement.

Q:                      When can I sell the shares of CIBER stock that I receive in
                        the merger?

A:                      The shares of CIBER common stock received by you in the
                        merger will be freely transferable unless you are an
                        "affiliate" of either CIBER or ARIS. Generally, an
                        "affiliate" is considered to be someone who is a senior
                        executive officer or director of a company or someone who
                        owns more than 10% of the outstanding stock of a company.

Q:                      How many shares of CIBER common stock will ARIS's
                        shareholders own after the merger?

A:                      Based on the number of outstanding shares of ARIS stock as
                        of June 28, 2001, after the merger, shareholders of ARIS
                        will own approximately 2.5 million shares of CIBER common
                        stock. This will constitute approximately 4% of the
                        outstanding CIBER common stock after the merger.

Q:                      What do I need to do now?

A:                      After carefully reading and considering the information
                        contained in this proxy statement/ prospectus, please
                        respond by completing, signing and dating your proxy card
                        and returning it in the enclosed postage paid envelope.
                        Alternatively, you may submit your proxy by telephone or by
                        using the internet by following the instructions herein.
                        Please submit your proxy as soon as possible so that your
                        shares may be represented at the special meeting.

Q:                      What happens if I do not indicate how to vote my proxy?

A:                      If you properly sign your proxy card but do not include
                        instructions on how to vote, your shares will be voted FOR
                        adoption of the merger agreement and approval of the merger.

Q:                      What happens if I do not return a proxy card?

A:                      Not returning your proxy card will have the same effect as
                        voting against the merger. This is why it is so important
                        that you make your vote count by completing and returning
                        your proxy card.

Q:                      May I change my vote after I have mailed my signed proxy
                        card or voted over the internet or the telephone?

A:                      Yes, you may change your vote at any time before your proxy
                        is voted at the special meeting. You can do this in one of
                        four ways:

                        -  you can send a written notice to the Secretary of ARIS
                        stating that you would like to revoke your proxy;

                        -  you can complete and submit a new proxy card;

                        -  you can vote by telephone or over the internet (your
                           latest vote is counted); or

                        -  you can attend the special meeting and vote in person.

                        If your ARIS stock is registered in your name, your
                        attendance at the meeting alone will not revoke your proxy.
                        Only your vote at the meeting will revoke your proxy.

Q:                      If my broker holds my shares in "street name," will my
                        broker vote my shares for me?

A:                      No. Your broker will not be able to vote your shares without
                        instructions from you. If you do not provide your broker
                        with voting instructions, your shares will be considered
                        present at the special meeting for purposes of determining a
                        quorum but will not be voted in favor of the merger. If you
                        have instructed a broker to vote your shares, you must
                        follow directions received from your broker to change those
                        instructions.

Q:                      Should I send in my stock certificates now?

A:                      No. After the merger is completed, CIBER's exchange agent
                        will send you written instructions for exchanging your ARIS
                        stock certificates for CIBER stock certificates.

Q:                      Will an ARIS shareholder's rights as a CIBER shareholder be
                        different than a ARIS shareholder's rights as a ARIS
                        shareholder?

A:                      Yes. At the time of the merger and upon the exchange of ARIS
                        common stock for CIBER common stock, each ARIS shareholder
                        will become a CIBER shareholder. There are differences
                        between the rights of shareholders of CIBER and shareholders
                        of ARIS. Please carefully review the description of these
                        differences in the section entitled "Comparison of Rights of
                        Holders of ARIS Common Stock and CIBER Common Stock" on page
                        54 of this proxy
                        statement/prospectus.

Q:                      Am I entitled to dissenters' rights?

A:                      Yes. Under Washington law, you are entitled to dissenters'
                        rights in the merger. Please review the discussion regarding
                        dissenters' rights on page 31 of this proxy
                        statement/prospectus for a complete description of how to
                        exercise your dissenters' rights.

Q:                      How many shares of common stock must be represented either
                        in person or by proxy to hold the meeting?

A:                      A majority of the outstanding shares of ARIS common stock
                        must be represented in person or by proxy to constitute a
                        quorum at the special meeting.

Q:                      How many votes are needed to approve the merger?

A:                      Two-thirds of the outstanding shares of ARIS common stock
                        must be voted in favor of the merger for it to be approved.

                        You should be aware that Kendall Kunz, ARIS's president and
                        chief executive officer, and Paul Song Chairman and founder
                        of ARIS and his family interests, have entered into
                        agreements with CIBER to vote their shares of ARIS common
                        stock in favor of the merger. These individuals held
                        approximately 35% of ARIS's outstanding common stock as of
                        the record date.

Q:                      When do you expect the merger to be completed?

A:                      CIBER and ARIS expect to complete the merger as soon as
                        possible after the ARIS special meeting on [meeting date].

Q:                      Who can help answer my questions?

A:                      You can call ARIS investor relations at (425) 372-2704 with
                        any questions about the merger.

THE MERGER

    THE MERGER AGREEMENT IS ATTACHED AS ANNEX A TO THIS PROXY
STATEMENT/PROSPECTUS AND IS INCORPORATED BY THIS REFERENCE INTO THIS PROXY
STATEMENT/PROSPECTUS. ARIS ENCOURAGES ITS SHAREHOLDERS TO READ THE MERGER
AGREEMENT AS IT IS THE LEGAL DOCUMENT THAT GOVERNS THE MERGER. CAPITALIZED TERMS
NOT DEFINED IN THIS PROXY STATEMENT/PROSPECTUS SHALL HAVE THE MEANINGS GIVEN TO
THEM IN THE MERGER AGREEMENT.

    ARIS will merge with and into CIBER, and CIBER shall be the surviving
entity. As a result of the merger, shareholders of ARIS will become shareholders
of CIBER, and ARIS will no longer exist as a separate entity.

SHAREHOLDER APPROVAL

    The holders of two-thirds of the outstanding shares of ARIS common stock
must approve and adopt the merger and the merger agreement. CIBER shareholders
are not required to adopt the merger agreement or vote on and approve the
merger. You are entitled to cast one vote for each share of ARIS common stock
you owned as of [record date], 2001, the record date for the special meeting.

RECOMMENDATION OF ARIS'S BOARD OF DIRECTORS

    After careful consideration, ARIS's board of directors has determined the
merger to be advisable and in your best interests and recommends that you vote
FOR the adoption of the merger agreement and approval of the merger.

OPINION OF ARIS'S FINANCIAL ADVISOR

    ARIS retained Friedman, Billings, Ramsey & Co., Inc. ("FBR") in a letter
agreement dated May 24, 2001, to review the fairness of the consideration to the
ARIS shareholders. FBR rendered an opinion to the ARIS board of directors on
June 11, 2001 to the effect that, based upon and subject to the considerations
and limitations set forth in such opinion, as of such date, the consideration
was fair, from a financial point of view, to the ARIS shareholders.

COMPLETION AND EFFECTIVENESS OF THE MERGER

    CIBER and ARIS will complete the merger when all of the conditions to
completion of the merger, as described below, are either satisfied or waived.
The merger will become effective upon the filing of a certificate of merger with
the State of Delaware, and the articles of merger and plan of merger with the
State of Washington.

    CIBER and ARIS are working toward completing the merger as quickly as
possible, and the parties hope to complete the merger in the third calendar
quarter of 2001.

CONDITIONS TO COMPLETION OF THE MERGER

    Completion of the merger is subject to the satisfaction or written waiver of
a number of conditions, including:

    - holders of two-thirds of the outstanding shares of ARIS common stock must
      vote in favor of adopting the merger agreement and approving the merger;

    - the registration statement, of which this proxy statement/prospectus is a
      part, must be declared and remain effective with the SEC;

    - no law, regulation or order preventing the completion of the merger shall
      be in effect;

    - any applicable waiting periods shall have expired; and

    - no pending or threatened legal proceeding exists in which a governmental
      entity is challenging the merger.

    In addition, there are other conditions that must be satisfied or waived by
ARIS or CIBER prior to the completion of the merger, these conditions are
described in greater detail in the section titled "The Merger Agreement"
beginning on page 34 of this proxy statement/prospectus.

TERMINATION OF THE MERGER AGREEMENT

    ARIS and CIBER may mutually agree to terminate the merger agreement without
completing the merger. Additionally, the merger maybe terminated under any of
the following circumstances:

    - by either party if the merger is not finalized by November 15, 2001;

    - by ARIS or CIBER if the other party shall have failed to perform in a
      material respect any of its representations, warranties, covenants
      contained in the agreement;

    - by either party if a court or other governmental entity shall have issued
      an order, decree or ruling permanently restraining, enjoining or otherwise
      prohibiting the transaction;

    - by either party if ARIS does not receive a two-thirds shareholder vote in
      favor of the merger at the ARIS Special Shareholders Meeting;

    - by CIBER if ARIS shall have violated the non-solicitation clause contained
      in the merger agreement;

    - by ARIS if the average of the daily closing prices of a share of CIBER
      Common Stock on the NYSE for the five (5) consecutive trading days ended
      three (3) days prior to the Closing is less than $4.00;

    - by ARIS if CIBER's Tangible Net Worth on the Final Closing Balance Sheet
      Date is less than ninety percent (90%) of its Tangible Net Worth on
      May 31, 2001;

    - by CIBER if ARIS shall have suffered or incurred any ARIS Material Adverse
      Effect since March 31, 2001; and

    - by CIBER if prior to the ARIS Shareholders' meeting, ARIS receives an
      Acquisition Proposal that it determines is a Superior Proposal, and the
      board of directors of ARIS resolves that it is in the best interest of
      ARIS to accept the Superior Proposal.

    In addition, even if ARIS has met all of the conditions to consummating the
merger, CIBER may pay to ARIS $2,500,000 in exchange for the right to cancel the
merger agreement at its sole discretion.

PAYMENT OF TERMINATION FEE

    Under certain situations if the merger is not completed, CIBER or ARIS may
be required to pay a termination fee of $1,500,000 to the other party under the
merger agreement. Furthermore, CIBER at its sole discretion, regardless of
whether or not the conditions to the merger have been waived or satisfied, may
pay ARIS a termination fee of $2,500,000 in exchange for the full release of all
obligations under the merger agreement.

ARIS PROHIBITED FROM SOLICITING OTHER OFFERS

    ARIS has agreed, subject to limited exceptions, not to initiate or engage in
discussions with another party regarding any business combination while the
merger with CIBER is pending. Furthermore, in the event that ARIS is approached
by another party that makes an Acquisition Proposal, ARIS has agreed to promptly
notify CIBER of the third party's proposal.

INTERESTS OF SOME ARIS DIRECTORS AND OFFICERS IN THE MERGER

    In considering the recommendations of the ARIS board of directors, you
should be aware that certain ARIS directors and executive officers have change
of control agreements and other contingent rights that may result in their
interests in the merger being different from yours.

SHARE OWNERSHIP OF MANAGEMENT

    As of the record date, ARIS directors, executive officers and affiliates
beneficially owned approximately   % of the outstanding shares of ARIS common
stock.

U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSEQUENCES OF THE MERGER

    In general, ARIS shareholders will not recognize gain or loss for United
States federal income tax purposes on the shares of CIBER they receive as a
result of the merger. ARIS shareholders will recognize gain or loss for United
States federal income tax purposes on the cash consideration received from
CIBER. The specific treatment of this gain or loss, and whether it will be
treated as dividend or capital gain or loss may vary from shareholder to
shareholder. You are encouraged to consult your own tax advisor because tax
matters can be complicated, and the tax consequences of the merger to you will
depend upon your own situation.

    It is a condition to the merger that CIBER and ARIS receive written
confirmations from professional service firms stating that the merger will
likely be considered a tax-free reorganization for U.S. federal income tax
purposes. You should carefully read the discussion under "U.S. federal income
tax consequences of the merger" on page 29 of this proxy statement/prospectus.
Again, you are encouraged to consult your own tax advisor because tax matters
can be complicated, and the tax consequences of the merger to you will depend
upon your own situation.

ACCOUNTING TREATMENT OF THE MERGER

    CIBER intends to account for the merger as a purchase.

RESTRICTIONS ON THE ABILITY TO SELL CIBER STOCK

    All shares of CIBER common stock received by you in connection with the
merger will be freely transferable unless you are considered an "affiliate" of
either CIBER or ARIS at the time of the merger. Affiliates of CIBER or ARIS are
subject to certain securities laws that restrict their ability to transfer the
shares they receive in the merger.

    Generally, an affiliate is considered to be someone who is a senior
executive officer or director of a company or someone who owns more than 10% of
the outstanding stock of a company.

LISTING OF CIBER COMMON STOCK

    The shares of CIBER common stock to be issued in connection with the merger
shall have been approved for listing on the NYSE subject to official notice of
issuance.

                    FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS IN THIS PROXY
                              STATEMENT/PROSPECTUS

    This proxy statement/prospectus and the documents incorporated by reference
into this proxy statement/prospectus contain forward-looking statements within
the "safe harbor" provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of
1995 with respect to CIBER's and ARIS's financial condition, results of
operations and businesses and on the expected impact of the merger on the
combined company's financial performance. Words such as "anticipates,"
"expects," "intends," "plans," "believes," "seeks," "estimates" and similar
expressions identify forward-looking statements. These forward-looking
statements are not guarantees of future performance and are subject to risks and
uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from the
results contemplated by the forward-looking statements. In evaluating the
merger, you should carefully consider the discussion of risks and uncertainties
in the section entitled "Risk Factors" on page 9 of this proxy statement/
prospectus.

                                  RISK FACTORS

    IN ADDITION TO THE RISKS RELATING TO THE BUSINESSES OF CIBER AND ARIS THAT
ARE INCORPORATED BY REFERENCE IN THIS PROXY STATEMENT/PROSPECTUS FROM OUR OTHER
SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION FILINGS, YOU SHOULD CAREFULLY CONSIDER THE
FOLLOWING RISK FACTORS RELATED TO THE MERGER IN DETERMINING WHETHER TO VOTE IN
FAVOR OF THE APPROVAL AND ADOPTION OF THE MERGER AND THE MERGER AGREEMENT. YOU
SHOULD ALSO CONSIDER THE RISK FACTORS THAT WILL GENERALLY HAVE AN IMPACT ON THE
COMBINED COMPANY'S FINANCIAL CONDITION, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND BUSINESS AFTER
THE MERGER, INCLUDING THOSE DESCRIBED IN "FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS IN THIS
PROXY STATEMENT/PROSPECTUS."

CIBER AND ARIS MAY ENCOUNTER DIFFICULTIES IN INTEGRATING THEIR OPERATIONS AND
MAY NOT ACHIEVE COST SAVINGS AND STRATEGIC AND OTHER BENEFITS.

    CIBER's acquisition of ARIS involves the combination of two companies that
have previously operated independently. CIBER and ARIS entered into the merger
agreement with the expectation that the merger will result in benefits to the
combined company. After the merger, integrating the operations of ARIS with
those of CIBER may be difficult, time consuming and costly. Any failure by CIBER
to integrate their operation successfully could have a material adverse effect
on the business of CIBER. The difficulties involved in integrating the
companies, which could be substantial, include the following:

    - management and key personnel could be distracted from the day-to-day
      business;

    - the business cultures of the two companies could prove to be incompatible;

    - managing the combined company's geographically dispersed operations could
      be difficult and costly;

    - the potential loss of customers who determine not to be customers of the
      combined company;

    - implementing uniform controls, systems, and procedures could be costly and
      time consuming; and

    - key officers, management, technical, sales, customer support, and other
      personnel may not be satisfied or happy in the combined company and may
      leave.

BECAUSE THE PRICE OF CIBER COMMON STOCK MAY FLUCTUATE, YOU CANNOT BE SURE OF THE
MARKET VALUE OF THE CIBER COMMON STOCK THAT YOU RECEIVE IN THE MERGER.

    Upon completion of the merger, each share of ARIS common stock will be
converted into .220 shares of CIBER common stock and the cash consideration of
$1.30. Any change in the price of CIBER common stock prior to the merger will
affect the market value of the shares of CIBER common stock that ARIS common
shareholders will receive on the date of the merger. The exchange ratio will be
adjusted for changes in the market price of CIBER common stock. If that price is
either less than $5.75 or greater than $8.75 an adjustment will be made to the
exchange ratio. Stock price changes may result from a variety of factors,
including general market and economic conditions, changes in CIBER's businesses,
operations and prospects and regulatory considerations. Many of these factors
are beyond CIBER's control. In addition, ARIS is permitted to terminate the
merger agreement if the average CIBER Closing Stock Price for the five
(5) consecutive trading days ended three (3) days prior to the final closing of
the merger is less than $4.00. The parties have agreed, however, that in the
event the average closing price of CIBER stock is less than $4.25, then the
CIBER Closing Stock Price shall be $4.25, and if such average closing price is
greater than $10.25, then the CIBER Closing Stock Price shall be $10.25.

    The prices of CIBER common stock and ARIS common stock at the closing of the
merger may vary from their respective prices on the date the merger agreement
was executed, on the date of this

joint proxy statement/prospectus and on the date of the ARIS shareholder
meeting. As a result, the value represented by the exchange ratio will also
vary. For example, based on the range of closing prices of CIBER common stock
during the period from June 13, 2001, the last trading day before public
announcement of the merger, through June 19, 2001, the exchange ratio
represented a value based on the CIBER common stock ranging from a high of $6.80
to a low of $6.17 for each share of ARIS common stock (excluding the $1.30 cash
payment). Because the date the merger is completed may be later than the dates
of the meeting, at the time of ARIS shareholders' meeting, you will not
necessarily know the market value of the combined company's common stock that
you will hold upon completion of the merger.

CONDITIONS TO THE MERGER MAY NOT BE SATISFIED.

    The merger agreement contains conditions that, if not satisfied or waived,
would result in the merger not occurring, even though the ARIS shareholders may
have approved it. We cannot assure you that all of the closing conditions to the
merger will be satisfied, that any unsatisfied conditions will be waived, or
that the merger will occur. If the merger does not occur, ARIS may incur
significant expenses that could have a material adverse effect on the financial
and operating results of ARIS.

ARIS MAY SUFFER FROM A MATERIAL ADVERSE AFFECT THAT RESULTS IN THE MERGER NOT
BECOMING FINAL.

    There are conditions placed on ARIS by the merger agreement that require
ARIS to retain employee consultants and not suffer an ARIS Material Adverse
Affect. Factors beyond ARIS's control will influence whether these employee
consultants choose to remain employed by the combined companies or choose to
work elsewhere. If less than 200 of the employee consultants employed as of
June 14, 2000 are not employed by ARIS as of the completion of the merger, then
ARIS will suffer material adverse effect and as a result the merger may not
become final. In addition, external factors such as the continued demand for
ARIS's services and whether ARIS is able to meet certain revenue targets
required by the merger agreement are beyond ARIS's control.

EVEN IF CONDITIONS TO THE MERGER ARE SATISFIED CIBER MAY CHOOSE TO NOT FINALIZE
THE TRANSACTION.

    Pursuant to the terms of the merger agreement CIBER, at it sole discretion,
and even if all conditions to the merger have been satisfied, may choose to pay
to ARIS $2,500,000 in exchange for not finalizing the merger. If CIBER were to
do so, the potential impact on ARIS's business remains an undetermined risk.

THE PRICE OF CIBER COMMON STOCK MAY BE AFFECTED BY FACTORS DIFFERENT FROM THOSE
AFFECTING THE VALUE OF ARIS COMMON STOCK.

    Upon completion of the merger, ARIS shareholders will become CIBER common
shareholders. CIBER's business differs from that of ARIS and CIBER's results of
operations, as well as the price of CIBER common stock, may be affected by
factors different from those affecting ARIS's results of operations and the
value of ARIS stock. For a discussion of CIBER's business and certain factors to
consider in connection with its business, see CIBER's Annual Report on
Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2000 and CIBER's Quarterly
Report on Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarter ended March 31, 2001, each of which
is incorporated by reference in this proxy statement/prospectus.

FUTURE RESULTS OF THE COMBINED COMPANIES MAY MATERIALLY DIFFER FROM THE PRO
FORMA FINANCIAL INFORMATION PRESENTED IN THIS DOCUMENT.

    Future results of the combined company may be materially different from
those shown in the pro forma financial statements that only show a combination
of our historical results.

THE TERMINATION FEE AND VOTING AGREEMENTS MAY DISCOURAGE OTHER COMPANIES FROM
TRYING TO ACQUIRE ARIS.

    In the merger agreement, ARIS agreed to pay CIBER a termination fee in
specified circumstances, including where ARIS breaches the no shop provisions of
the agreement, resolves to accept a Superior Proposal, or withdraws, modifies or
amends its approval or recommendation in favor of the Merger in a manner adverse
to CIBER.

    In addition, shareholders who held, as of [record date], approximately 35%
of the common stock of ARIS outstanding on that date have signed voting
agreements agreeing to vote in favor of the merger proposal and against any
proposal relating to the acquisition of ARIS by a third party. These agreements
could discourage other companies from trying to acquire ARIS even though another
company might be willing to offer greater value to ARIS than ARIS will receive
by virtue of the merger. In addition, payment by ARIS of the termination fee and
of CIBER's expenses could have an adverse effect on ARIS's financial condition.

ARIS MAY LOSE AN OPPORTUNITY TO ENTER INTO A MERGER OR BUSINESS COMBINATION WITH
ANOTHER PARTY ON MORE FAVORABLE TERMS BECAUSE OF PROVISIONS IN THE MERGER
AGREEMENT THAT PROHIBIT ARIS FROM ENTERING INTO SUCH TRANSACTIONS OR SOLICITING
SUCH PROPOSALS.

    While the merger agreement is in effect, subject to certain exceptions
contained in the merger agreement, ARIS's board of directors is not to solicit,
initiate or encourage any inquiries or proposals that may lead to a proposal or
offer to enter into certain transactions, such as a merger, sale of assets or
other business combination, with any person other than CIBER. As a result of
these restrictions, ARIS may lose an opportunity to enter into a transaction
with another potential partner on more favorable terms.

IF THE MERGER IS NOT COMPLETED, ARIS MAY BE UNABLE TO ATTRACT ANOTHER STRATEGIC
PARTNER ON EQUIVALENT OR MORE ATTRACTIVE TERMS THAN THOSE BEING OFFERED BY
CIBER.

    If the merger agreement is terminated and the ARIS board of directors
determines that it is in the best interests of the ARIS shareholders to seek a
merger or business combination with another strategic partner, ARIS cannot
assure you that it will be able to find a partner offering terms equivalent or
more attractive than the price and terms offered by CIBER in the merger.

THE INTERNAL REVENUE SERVICE COULD CHALLENGE THE TAX-FREE NATURE OF THE MERGER.

    Notwithstanding both CIBER and ARIS's intention that this transaction
qualify as a tax-free reorganization, there remains some degree of risk that the
Internal Revenue Service will challenge the tax-free status of this transaction.
Neither CIBER nor ARIS can guarantee that such a challenge would be
unsuccessful.

                    THE SPECIAL MEETING OF ARIS SHAREHOLDERS

PROXY STATEMENT/PROSPECTUS

    This proxy statement/prospectus is being furnished to you in connection with
the solicitation of proxies by ARIS's board of directors in connection with the
proposed merger. This proxy statement/ prospectus is first being furnished to
shareholders of ARIS on or about             , 2001.

DATE, TIME AND PLACE OF THE SPECIAL MEETING.

    The special meeting of shareholders of ARIS is scheduled as follows:

10:00  a.m.
August       , 2001
ARIS Corporation
2229 112th Avenue NE
Bellevue, WA 98004-2936

PURPOSE OF THE SPECIAL MEETING

    The special meeting is being held so that shareholders of ARIS can consider
and vote upon a proposal to adopt the merger agreement and transact any other
business that properly comes before the special meeting or any adjournment
thereof. Adoption of the merger agreement will also constitute approval of the
merger and the other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement.

    If the shareholders of ARIS approve and adopt the merger agreement and the
other conditions to completion of the merger are satisfied or waived, ARIS will
merge with and into CIBER. You will be entitled to receive $1.30 cash and .220
of one share of CIBER common stock for each share of ARIS common stock that you
hold on the effective date of the merger (subject to adjustments as provided in
the merger agreement).

SHAREHOLDER RECORD DATE FOR THE SPECIAL MEETING

    ARIS's board of directors has fixed the close of business on             as
the record date for determination of ARIS shareholders entitled to notice of,
and to vote at, the special meeting. On the record date, there were [      ]
shares of ARIS common stock outstanding, held by approximately [      ] holders
of record.

    A majority of the outstanding shares of ARIS common stock entitled to vote
at the special meeting must be represented, either in person or by proxy, to
constitute a quorum at the special meeting. The affirmative vote of the holders
of at least two-thirds of the shares of ARIS common stock outstanding on the
record date is required to adopt the merger agreement. You are entitled to one
vote for each share of ARIS common stock held by you on the record date on each
proposal to be presented to shareholders at the special meeting.

    On the record date for the special meeting, directors and executive officers
of ARIS and their affiliates held approximately [      ] shares of ARIS common
stock representing approximately       % of all outstanding shares of ARIS
common stock as of the record date.

    Kendall Kunz, ARIS's president and chief executive officer, and Paul Song,
Chairman and founder of ARIS, and Paul Song's family interests, have executed
voting agreements in favor of CIBER, and have agreed to vote their shares of
ARIS common stock in favor of the merger. These individuals hold approximately
35% of ARIS's outstanding common stock as of the record date.

PROXIES

    All shares of ARIS common stock represented by properly executed proxies
received before or at the special meeting will, unless the proxies are revoked,
be voted in accordance with the instructions indicated on the proxies. If no
instructions are indicated on a properly executed proxy, the shares will be
voted FOR adoption of the merger agreement. If you hold your ARIS stock in a
brokerage account or through a bank, you are urged to vote your proxy through
the internet, the telephone, or mark a box on the proxy and to indicate how to
vote your shares.

    If a properly executed proxy is returned and the shareholder has instructed
the proxies to abstain from voting on adoption of the merger agreement, the ARIS
common stock represented by the proxy will be considered present at the special
meeting for purposes of determining a quorum, but will not be voted for or
against the merger, thereby having the effect of being a vote against the
merger. If your shares are held in an account at a brokerage firm or bank, you
must instruct such institution how to vote your shares. If an executed proxy
card is returned by a broker holding shares in the name of a brokerage firm or
bank and it indicates that the broker or bank does not have instructions or
discretionary authority to vote on adoption of the merger agreement, then the
shares will be considered present at the meeting for the purpose of determining
a quorum, but will not be considered to have been voted in favor of adoption of
the merger agreement. Your broker or bank will vote your shares only if you
provide instructions on how to vote by following the information provided to you
by your broker or bank.

    Because adoption of the merger agreement requires the affirmative vote of
two-thirds of the shares of ARIS common stock outstanding on the record date,
abstentions, failures to vote and broker non-votes will have the same effect as
a vote against adoption of the merger agreement.

    ARIS does not expect that any matter other than adoption of the merger
agreement will be brought before the special meeting. If, however, other matters
are properly presented, the persons named as proxies will vote in accordance
with their judgment with respect to those matters, unless authority to do so is
withheld in the proxy.

    You may revoke your proxy at any time before it is voted by:

    - notifying in writing the Secretary of ARIS at ARIS Corporation at 2229
      112th Avenue NE Bellevue, WA 98004-2936;

    - properly submitting a subsequent proxy;

    - appearing in person and voting at the special meeting; or

    - if you voted electronically through the internet or by telephone, changing
      your vote by voting again at a later date, using the same procedures.

    Attendance at the special meeting will not in and of itself constitute the
revocation of a proxy.

    You should not send in any stock certificates with your proxies. A
transmittal form with instructions for surrender of the stock certificates of
ARIS common stock will be mailed to you as soon as practicable after completion
of the merger.

VOTING ELECTRONICALLY OR BY TELEPHONE

    Because Washington, the state in which ARIS is incorporated, permits
electronic submission of proxies through the internet or by telephone, in
addition to submission of proxies by mail on the enclosed proxy card or voting
instructions, ARIS shareholders whose shares are held by a broker or bank have
the option to vote electronically by submitting their proxies or voting
instructions through the internet or by telephone. Please review your proxy card
for exact instructions on how to vote on the internet or by telephone.

    The internet and telephone procedures described below for submitting your
proxy or voting instructions are designed to authenticate shareholders'
identities, to allow shareholders to have their shares voted and to confirm that
their instructions have been properly recorded. Shareholders submitting proxies
or voting instructions via the internet should understand that there may be
costs associated with electronic access, such as usage charges from internet
access providers and telephone companies, which would be borne by the
shareholder.

    ARIS holders whose shares are held in their brokerage account or through a
bank need to check their proxy card and the instructions for voting
electronically.

SOLICITATION OF PROXIES

    CIBER and ARIS will equally share the expenses incurred in connection with
the printing and mailing of this proxy statement/prospectus. ARIS will also
request banks, brokers and other intermediaries holding shares of ARIS common
stock beneficially owned by others to send this proxy statement/prospectus to,
and obtain proxies from, the beneficial owners and will reimburse the holders
for their reasonable expenses in so doing. Solicitation of proxies by mail may
be supplemented by telephone, telegram and other electronic means,
advertisements and personal solicitation by the directors, officers or employees
of ARIS. No additional compensation will be paid to directors, officers or
employees for such solicitation. ARIS has retained Allen Nelson and Company to
serve as proxy solicitor.

    You should not send in any stock certificates with your proxy card. A
transmittal letter with instructions for the surrender of stock certificates
will be mailed to you as soon as practicable after completion of the merger.

                                   THE MERGER

    This section of the proxy statement/prospectus describes material aspects of
the proposed merger, including the merger agreement. While we believe that the
description covers the material terms of the merger, this summary may not
contain all of the information that is important to you. You should read this
entire proxy statement/prospectus and the other documents we refer to carefully
for a more complete understanding of the merger. In addition, we incorporate
important business and financial information about CIBER and ARIS into this
proxy statement/prospectus by reference. You may obtain the information
incorporated by reference into this proxy statement/prospectus without charge by
following the instructions in the section entitled "Where You Can Find More
Information" on page 64 of this proxy statement/prospectus.

EFFECT OF THE MERGER AND CONVERSION OF ARIS COMMON STOCK

    Upon the completion of the merger, ARIS will merge with and into CIBER.
CIBER will survive the merger, and ARIS will no longer exist as a separate
entity. The shareholders of ARIS will become shareholders of CIBER. The CIBER
Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, the CIBER Amended and
Restated Bylaws, and the laws of the State of Delaware govern the rights of
CIBER shareholders. See "Comparison of Rights of Holders of ARIS Common Stock
and CIBER Common Stock" on page 54 of this proxy statement/prospectus.

    At the closing of the merger, by virtue of the merger and without any
further action on the part of CIBER, ARIS or any of their security holders, each
share of ARIS common stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
effective time, including those shares held by ARIS or any of its direct or
indirect subsidiaries immediately prior to the closing of the merger, will be
automatically converted into the right to receive $1.30 cash and .220 of one
share of CIBER common stock (subject to adjustments as provided in the merger
agreement). Each ARIS shareholder will need to surrender the certificate
representing such share(s) of ARIS common stock in the manner provided for in
the merger agreement, or in the case of a lost, stolen or destroyed certificate,
upon delivery of an affidavit, and bond, if required.

    The exchange ratio in the merger will be appropriately adjusted in the event
of any stock split, reverse stock split, stock dividend, extraordinary cash
dividends, reorganization, re-capitalization, reclassification, combination,
exchange of shares or other like change with respect to CIBER common stock or
ARIS common stock occurring prior to the consummation of the merger. No
fractional shares of CIBER common stock will be issued in connection with the
merger. Instead you will receive a cash payment as determined under the merger
agreement.

BACKGROUND OF THE MERGER

    In September 2000 ARIS Corporation's board of directors and its President
and CEO, Mr. Kendall W. Kunz, began considering strategic options for ARIS,
including possible acquisitions and business combinations. During the latter
part of 2000 and early 2001, ARIS Corporation's board of directors and senior
management considered various strategic alternatives to increase shareholder
value, including a sale of ARIS.

    Following a meeting of the board of directors of ARIS on February 1, 2001,
during which continued pursuing strategic alternatives for ARIS were discussed,
Mr. Kunz contacted several investment bankers and industry leaders who offered
ideas for strategic alternatives to improve shareholder value of ARIS.

    On February 26, 2001, Mr. Mac Slingerlend, president and Chief Executive
Officer of CIBER, Inc. approached Mr. Paul Y. Song, founder and chairman of the
ARIS board of directors, to discuss the possible strategic combination between
ARIS and CIBER or one of CIBER's operating subsidiaries.

    On March 8, 2001, ARIS and CIBER entered into a non-disclosure agreement
allowing for the initial meeting between management of both companies.

    On March 8, 2001, a number of executive officers of ARIS and CIBER met. The
companies' representatives discussed potential operating synergies, including
the overlap of services and geographic regions. They also explored the
possibility of expanded services and expanded geographic reach. A number of
potential strategic combination options were discussed.

    On March 26, 2001 executives of CIBER and ARIS met to further discuss merger
alternatives.

    On April 3, 2001, ARIS and CIBER continued discussions of a possible
business combination. Mr. David Durham, Chief Financial Officer of CIBER,
informed Mr. Kunz that CIBER had retained an investment banking firm to handle
the transaction for CIBER.

    On April 5, 2001, Mr. Kunz received an email from Mr. Durham outlining a
possible timetable for continuing discussing and a preliminary due diligence
list. On April 6, 2001, Mr. Kunz received a phone call from Mr. Durham
confirming the timetable. Mr. Kunz provided Mr. Durham with an updated due
diligence list and opinion on the timetable.

    On April 12, 2001, executives of ARIS, CIBER, CIBER operating branches, and
CIBER's financial advisors met to discuss potential transactions. At this
meeting, ARIS senior management presented information as requested from the
preliminary due diligence list. The companies discussed a number of strategic
combinations including the outright purchase of ARIS by CIBER. At the meeting,
the representatives concluded that significant operating synergies and cultural
compatibility made a combination between ARIS and CIBER a positive move for
employees, customers and shareholders, both in the short and long term. They
also determined that the financial compatibility required discussion before
conducting further business evaluations.

    On April 16, 2001, Mr. Kunz provided CIBER management with additional
information clarifying the preliminary due diligence list.

    During the week of April 30, 2001, representatives of the parties negotiated
price and financial structure of the proposed merger.

    During the week of April 30, 2001, ARIS advised CIBER of its intentions to
engage Friedman Billings & Ramsey Co., Inc. as its exclusive financial advisor
and to provide an opinion as to the fairness of this transaction to the ARIS
board of directors. In addition, ARIS engaged Van Valkenberg Furber Law Group
P.L.L.C. to provide legal advice and to conduct due diligence for the potential
transaction.

    On May 4, 2001, Mr. Song and Mr. Kunz received a proposed letter of intent
outlining financial and other terms of a proposed merger between ARIS and CIBER
whereby CIBER proposed to buy all of the outstanding stock of ARIS Corporation.

    On May 8, 2001, executives of CIBER and ARIS met to discuss operating
synergies and company integration.

    On May 11, 2001, the ARIS board of directors held a conference call to
consider CIBER's acquisition proposal. The board authorized management to
continue discussions and to negotiate the terms of a definitive agreement with
CIBER. It also authorized management to engage Friedman Billings & Ramsey
Co., Inc. as the exclusive financial advisor, and to provide a fairness opinion
to ARIS.

    On May 16, 2001, executives of CIBER attended a meeting in Bellevue, WA with
members of ARIS management to further discuss the merits of combining CIBER's
and ARIS's operations.

    On May 17, 2001, the ARIS board of directors held a regular meeting and
received an update from management and its legal advisors on the status of
discussions with CIBER. In addition, ARIS's

legal advisors reviewed the fiduciary duties of the board with regard to the
proposed transaction. The board instructed management to continue to negotiate
terms of a definitive agreement of merger with CIBER.

    The attorneys for ARIS and CIBER and their respective financial advisors,
began conducting legal and financial due diligence reviews on May 18, 2001.

    During the period between May 11, 2001 and June 13, 2001, Van Valkenberg
Furber Law Group P.L.L.C. and Davis Graham & Stubbs LLP, counsel for CIBER,
continued their respective due diligence reviews and engaged in discussions
regarding the terms and conditions of the proposed merger. Members of ARIS
management teams and their financial advisors also held a series of conference
calls during that time to review preliminary terms and continue discussions
regarding a proposed combination. Further, representatives from ARIS and its
financial and legal advisers continued to negotiate the terms of the proposed
merger with CIBER and its advisers.

    On June 11, 2001, the ARIS board of directors met via telephone. Present at
the meeting were the directors, senior management of ARIS, Friedman Billings &
Ramsey Co., Inc. and Brad Furber Law Group P.L.L.C. of Van Valkenberg Furber.
Mr. Kunz began the meeting by reviewing the status of the proposed transaction
with CIBER and by providing a strategic overview. He then summarized the
diligence efforts to date, the results of the negotiations, and the terms of the
proposed merger, including, but not limited to:

    - status and timing of the transaction;

    - pricing and valuation of the proposed merger;

    - strategies and business opportunities with CIBER;

    - various business issues relating to the merger;

    - the voting agreement;

    - affiliate agreements;

    - the restrictions on ARIS's ability to pursue alternative transactions;

    - closing conditions;

    - material adverse effect definitions;

    - termination provisions; and

    - a review of CIBER's performance and prospects.

    Mr. Furber made a presentation to the ARIS board during which he reminded
the directors of their duties and responsibilities under Washington law.
Following Mr. Furber's presentation, Friedman Billings & Ramsey Co., Inc.
presented an analysis of the financial terms of the proposed merger with CIBER
and delivered its oral opinion, subsequently confirmed in writing as of
June 14, 2001, as to the fairness of the merger consideration and exchange
ratio, from a financial point of view, to the holders of ARIS common stock.
Following these presentations and the related discussions by the ARIS board, the
ARIS board of directors concluded that the merger was in the best interests of
ARIS shareholders, declared the merger advisable, approved the proposed terms of
the merger and the merger agreement in substantially the form presented,
authorized ARIS's officers to complete the negotiations and execute the merger
agreement and resolved to recommend that ARIS shareholders vote to adopt the
merger agreement. In connection with the merger, the board also resolved to
declare that the ARIS 1995, 1997, and 2000 stock option plans would be clarified
by declaring that this merger would not be considered a liquidation or
dissolution for purposes of vesting acceleration.

    The merger agreement originally provided for the merger of ARIS with and
into a wholly owned subsidiary of CIBER. However, upon additional review, both
CIBER and ARIS felt the present merger structure, with ARIS merging into CIBER
was the preferred merger structure given the parties objectives. Effective as of
June 14, 2001, ARIS and CIBER entered into the Amended and Restated Merger
Agreement and Mr. Song, Mrs. Tina Song, AHS LLC (an entity controlled by
Mr. Song), and Mr. Kunz entered into amended and restated voting agreements with
CIBER. Before the opening of trading on June 14, 2001, ARIS and CIBER issued a
joint press release announcing the merger.

JOINT REASONS FOR THE MERGER

    The boards of directors of ARIS and CIBER have determined that a combined
company would be positioned to compete more effectively in the market, thereby
increasing the potential for improved long-term operating and financial results.
In particular, the boards believe that the merger will create the opportunity
for ARIS and CIBER to:

    - provide their customers with a more complete service offering that will
      better serve the needs of customers;

    - provide their respective employees with the ability to expand their skills
      and their careers;

    - provide critical mass in areas such as Seattle, Denver, and New Jersey;

    - create a platform for European operations in the United Kingdom; and

    - reverse the current operating loss trend of ARIS's operations to
      contribution status.

FACTORS CONSIDERED BY AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE ARIS BOARD OF DIRECTORS

    At a meeting of the ARIS board of directors on June 11, 2001, after due
consideration, the ARIS board:

    - determined that the merger is in the best interests of ARIS and its
      shareholders;

    - approved the merger and the merger agreement; and

    - determined to recommend that the shareholders of ARIS adopt the merger
      agreement and approve the transactions contemplated thereby.

    Accordingly, the ARIS board of directors recommends that the ARIS
shareholders vote FOR adoption of the merger agreement.

    In reaching its decision to approve the merger and to recommend such merger
to its shareholders, the board of directors consulted with ARIS senior
management and with ARIS's financial advisor, Friedman Billings Ramsey & Co.,
Inc., and its outside legal counsel Van Valkenberg Furber Law Group P.L.L.C. In
reaching its decision, the board considered all of the reasons described above
under "Joint Reasons for the Merger," including the board's belief that a
combined company would be positioned to compete more effectively in the market,
thereby increasing the potential for improved long-term operating and financial
results. The ARIS board also considered the following factors which it believes
favor approval of the merger:

    - MERGER CONSIDERATION. The ARIS board analyzed the market value of the
      CIBER common stock to be issued in exchange for each share of ARIS common
      stock in light of comparable merger transactions.

    - OPINION OF FRIEDMAN BILLINGS & RAMSEY CO., INC. The ARIS board considered
      the opinion of Friedman Billings Ramsey & Co., Inc. ("FBR"), issued on
      June 14, 2001 to the ARIS board of directors as to the fairness, from a
      financial point of view, of the exchange ratio to the holders of ARIS
      common stock. A copy of the FBR opinion is attached as Annex B hereto.

    - PRESENTATION OF FBR. The ARIS board considered the various financial
      information, valuation analyses and other factors set forth in the
      presentation by FBR at the ARIS board meeting on June 11, 2001, including
      those described below in the section entitled "Opinion of ARIS's financial
      advisor."

    - HISTORICAL INFORMATION. The ARIS board considered historical information
      concerning CIBER's and ARIS's respective businesses, financial performance
      and conditions, operations, technologies, management and competitive
      positions, including public reports concerning results of operations
      during the most recent fiscal year and fiscal quarter for each company
      filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

    - MARKET CONDITIONS. The ARIS board considered current financial market
      conditions, historical market prices, and volatility and trading
      information with respect to CIBER common stock and ARIS common stock.

    - STOCK VOLATILITY, MICRO-CAPITALIZATION STATUS, EXPOSURE TO INSTITUTIONAL
      HOLDERS. The ARIS board considered current trading volumes, potential
      stock liquidity and market capitalization size of ARIS common stock as
      well as the short and long term potential of attracting institutional
      holders of ARIS stock.

    - AVAILABLE ALTERNATIVES. The ARIS board considered potential transactions
      with third parties based on inquiries made by Mr. Kunz at the direction of
      ARIS's board as well as ARIS management's view on the potential for other
      third parties to enter into strategic relationships with, or to acquire,
      ARIS.

    - POSSIBLE DECLINE IN MARKET PRICE OF ARIS SHARES. The ARIS board considered
      the possibility that if a transaction with CIBER is not consummated and
      ARIS remained a publicly owned corporation, the price that might be
      received by ARIS shareholders in the open market or in a future
      transaction might be less than the consideration to be received pursuant
      to the merger.

    - TERMS OF THE MERGER AGREEMENT. The ARIS board considered the terms of the
      merger agreement, including, among others, the circumstances under which
      the ARIS board may withdraw its recommendation of the merger, the ARIS
      board's ability to consider a superior acquisition proposal, the
      conditions to closing of the merger and the termination provisions of the
      merger agreement.

    - TAX-DEFERRED NATURE OF TRANSACTION. The ARIS board noted that the merger
      is expected to be a tax-deferred transaction.

    - TRANSACTION ACCOUNTED FOR AS A PURCHASE. The ARIS board noted that the
      merger is expected to be accounted for as a purchase transaction.

    - TRENDS IN THE INDUSTRY. The ARIS board considered various trends in the
      information technology industry and the effect of industry consolidation
      on ARIS's ability to compete effectively in existing markets.

    ARIS's board of directors also identified and considered a variety of
potentially negative factors in its deliberations concerning the merger,
including, but not limited to:

    - the possibility that the merger might not be consummated, and the fact
      that under some circumstances ARIS might be required to pay a termination
      fee to CIBER;

    - the effect that the public announcement of the merger might have on ARIS's
      sales and operating results, ARIS's ability to attract and retain key
      personnel and the progress of ARIS's current business development and
      marketing projects;

    - the risk that potential benefits sought in the merger might not be fully
      realized, that some of ARIS's customers may view CIBER negatively and seek
      to terminate their relationships with ARIS and that the combined company
      may not be able to retain key personnel;

    - the limitations placed on ARIS relating to its ability to pursue
      alternative transactions and to conduct its business prior to the closing;
      and

    - the substantial costs to be incurred in connection with the merger,
      including the costs of integrating the businesses and transaction expenses
      arising from the merger.

    After due consideration and discussion, ARIS's board of directors decided
that these risks were outweighed by the potential benefits of the merger.

    The foregoing discussion is not exhaustive of all the factors considered by
ARIS's board. Each member of ARIS's board may have considered different factors,
and the board did not quantify or otherwise assign relative weights to factors
considered.

FACTORS CONSIDERED BY THE CIBER BOARD OF DIRECTORS

    CIBER's board of directors considered the following as reasons to pursue the
merger:

    - the opportunity to establish a business presence in the United Kingdom;

    - the opportunity to strengthen CIBER's Oracle relationship and delivery
      capability;

    - the opportunity to strengthen CIBER's presence in the Seattle, New Jersey,
      Denver and Dallas markets;

    - the opportunity to achieve improved operating efficiency based on CIBER's
      analysis of ARIS's cost structure;

    - ARIS's long-term client relationships and long-term committed employees;
      and

    - the belief that ARIS's balance sheet will contribute positively to CIBER's
      overall financial strength.

    CIBER's board of directors also examined and reviewed the risks associated
with the merger, those risks are more fully discussed in the "Risk Factors"
section on page 9 of this proxy statement/ prospectus.

OPINION OF ARIS'S FINANCIAL ADVISOR

    ARIS retained Friedman, Billings, Ramsey & Co., Inc. ("FBR") in a letter
agreement dated May 24, 2001, to review the fairness of the consideration to the
ARIS stockholders. FBR rendered an opinion to the ARIS board of directors on
June 11, 2001 to the effect that, based upon and subject to the considerations
and limitations set forth in such opinion, as of such date, the consideration
was fair, from a financial point of view, to the ARIS stockholders. The full
text of FBR's opinion, which sets forth the assumptions made, the general
procedures followed, the matters considered and the limits on the review
undertaken, is included as Annex B to this document. The summary of FBR's
opinion set forth below is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full
text of such opinion. You are urged to read the FBR opinion carefully and in its
entirety. In connection with rendering its opinion, FBR, among other things:

    - Reviewed the Merger Agreement and the financial terms and conditions set
      forth therein, as well as the schedules thereto;

    - Reviewed the audited balance sheets and the audited results of operations
      and statements of cash flow of CIBER and ARIS included in their respective
      annual Reports on Form 10-K for

      the year ended December 31, 2000, accompanied in each case by the audit
      report thereon of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP in the case of ARIS, and KPMG
      LLP in the case of CIBER, and the unaudited balance sheets of CIBER and
      ARIS as of March 31, 2001 and the related results of operations and
      statement of cash flows for the three-month period then ended;

    - Reviewed other data relating to CIBER and ARIS, including: certain

      financial forecasts; and other forward-looking financial information,
      concerning CIBER and ARIS, prepared by the management teams of the
      respective companies;

    - Reviewed certain publicly available research estimates by research
      analysts regarding ARIS and CIBER, respectively;

    - Reviewed the reported stock price and trading activity for ARIS Common
      Stock and CIBER Common Stock;

    - Compared the financial performance and securities data of ARIS and CIBER
      with that of certain other companies it deemed comparable to ARIS and
      CIBER whose securities are traded in public markets, which securities like
      many information technology services and Internet-related stocks have been
      and are likely to continue to be subject to significant short-term price
      and trading volatility;

    - Compared the financial terms of the transaction with the financial terms,
      to the extent publicly available, of other transactions that it deemed
      relevant;

    - Participated in discussions and negotiations among representatives of ARIS
      and CIBER and their advisors; and

    - Made such other studies and inquiries, and reviewed such other data, as it
      deemed relevant.

    FBR also considered such other information, financial studies, analyses,
investigations and financial, economic and market criteria that it considered
relevant. FBR also discussed the past and current business operations and
financial condition of ARIS, as well as other matters FBR believed relevant to
its inquiry, with certain officers and employees of ARIS. In its review and
analysis and in arriving at its opinion, FBR assumed and relied upon the
accuracy and completeness of all of the financial and other information provided
to it or publicly available and neither attempted independently to verify, nor
assumed any responsibility for verifying, any of such information. FBR did not
conduct a physical inspection of any of the properties or facilities of ARIS or
CIBER, did not make or obtain or assume any responsibility for making or
obtaining any independent evaluations or appraisals of any of such properties or
facilities or any intellectual property owned, licensed or used by ARIS or
CIBER, and FBR was not furnished with any such evaluations or appraisals. With
respect to financial forecasts regarding ARIS and CIBER, FBR relied on estimates
prepared by the management teams of ARIS and CIBER, respectively, and assumed
that the estimates had been reasonably prepared and reflected the best currently
available estimates and judgments of the management teams of ARIS and CIBER,
respectively, as to the future financial performance of ARIS and CIBER,
respectively. FBR expressed no view with respect to those financial forecasts or
the assumptions on which they were based. FBR assumed that the merger will
qualify as a tax-free reorganization for United States federal income tax
purposes, will be accounted for as a purchase for financial reporting purposes,
and will be consummated in a timely manner in accordance with the terms of the
merger agreement, without waiver of any of the conditions to the merger
contained in the merger agreement.

    FBR was not asked to consider, and its opinion does not address, the
relative merits of the merger as compared to any alternative business strategy
that might exist for ARIS. FBR's opinion necessarily was based on conditions as
they existed and could be evaluated on the date of its opinion, and FBR assumed
no responsibility to update or revise its opinion based upon circumstances or
events occurring

after that date. FBR's opinion does not constitute an opinion or imply any
conclusion as to the price at which CIBER common stock will trade following the
merger's closing. FBR's opinion was, in any event, limited to the fairness, from
a financial point of view, of the consideration to be paid to the holders of
ARIS common stock and did not address ARIS's underlying business decision to
effect the merger or constitute a recommendation of the merger to ARIS or a
recommendation to any holder of ARIS common stock as to how such holder should
vote with respect to the merger. In connection with rendering its opinion, FBR
made a presentation to the ARIS board of directors on June 11, 2001, with
respect to analyses performed by FBR in evaluating the fairness of the
consideration to be paid to the holders of ARIS common stock in the merger.
Below is a summary of that presentation. In some cases, the summary of the
financial analyses includes information presented in tabular format. In order to
understand the financial analyses used by FBR, the tables below must be read and
interpreted together with the text of each summary. The tables alone do not
constitute a complete description of the financial analyses. The following
quantitative information, to the extent it is based on market data, is, except
as otherwise indicated, based on market data as it existed at or prior to
June 7, 2001 and does not necessarily reflect current or future market
conditions.

HISTORICAL TRADING ANALYSES.

    FBR performed analyses based on the historical trading prices of ARIS common
stock and CIBER common stock and the relationship between the two.

IMPLIED HISTORICAL EXCHANGE RATIOS.

    FBR derived implied historical exchange ratios by dividing the closing price
per share of ARIS common stock by the closing price per share of CIBER common
stock for each trading day in the calendar period from September 20, 2000
through June 7, 2001. FBR calculated that the latest implied exchange ratio for
the total per share consideration of $2.77 per share (as of June 7, 2001) was
0.4143, the highest implied exchange ratio during the period was 0.4710, and the
lowest implied exchange ratio during the period was 0.1617. FBR also calculated
the average implied exchange ratios for each of the following calendar periods
ending June 7, 2001:

Last 30 Days................................................   0.2409
Last 60 Days................................................   0.2512
Last 90 Days................................................   0.2717
Last 120 Days...............................................   0.2870
Last 180 Days...............................................   0.3053

FBR noted that in each case described in the table above, the average implied
exchange ratio was lower than the latest implied exchange ratio of 0.4143.

IMPLIED PREMIUM ANALYSIS.

    FBR analyzed the implied premiums to a holder of a share of ARIS common
stock represented by the latest implied exchange ratio of 0.4143 and certain
closing and average prices of ARIS common stock and CIBER common stock. By
multiplying the latest implied exchange ratio by the price of a share of CIBER
common stock on June 7, 2001 ($6.69) and comparing it to the price of a share of
ARIS common stock, FBR noted that the merger would yield a 38.6% premium to a
holder of ARIS common stock with respect to the closing price of ARIS common
stock as of June 7, 2001, a 46.9% premium to the average closing price of ARIS
common stock for the 30-day period ending June 7, 2001 ($1.66), and a 46.9%
premium to the average closing price of ARIS common stock for the 180-day period
ending June 7, 2001 ($1.89). The following table summarizes the implied premiums
for

ARIS when comparing the value of the total consideration for each share of ARIS
common stock to be paid in the merger to the average ARIS common stock closing
prices for the periods indicated:

TIME PERIOD                                                   IMPLIED PREMIUM
- -----------                                                   ---------------

30-Day Average..............................................        67.0%
60-Day Average..............................................        84.8%
90-Day Average..............................................        68.6%
120-Day Average.............................................        64.9%
180-Day Average.............................................        46.9%

IMPLIED VALUATION ANALYSES.

    FBR performed analyses using publicly available information concerning
comparable companies and transactions, as well as historical and projected
financial information for ARIS and CIBER to derive implied valuation information
for ARIS and CIBER.

COMPARABLE COMPANY ANALYSIS.

    FBR reviewed publicly available financial, operating and stock market
information for ARIS, CIBER and seven other publicly traded companies that
operate in the information technology and consulting services industry that FBR
deemed comparable to ARIS and CIBER. The comparable companies were:

    - Answerthink, Inc. (ANSR)

    - Computer Horizons Corp. (CHRZ)

    - Luminant Worldwide Corporation (LUMT)

    - Navigant Consulting, Inc. (NCI)

    - Scient Corporation (SCNT)

    - Syntel Inc.(SYNT)

    - Viant Corporation (VIAN)

    FBR derived the following, among other things, for ARIS, CIBER and each of
these companies:

    - the ratio of each company's enterprise value to: (a) its revenue for the
      last 12 months ended March 31, 2001 and the calendar year ended
      December 31, 2000; and (b) its estimated revenue for the calendar year
      ended December 31, 2001; and,

    - the ratio of each company's enterprise value to its billable employee
      headcount at March 31, 2001.

    For the purposes of this analysis, forecasted financial information for the
comparable companies was derived from equity research reports published by
investment banks. Enterprise value was calculated as the sum of the value of:

    - all shares of common stock, assuming the exercise of all in-the-money
      options, warrants and convertible securities, less the proceeds from such
      exercise; plus

    - non-convertible debt; plus

    - non-convertible preferred stock; plus

    - minority interests; minus

    - cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments.

    The following table sets forth the results of these calculations:

                                                                    COMPARABLE COMPANIES
                                                              --------------------------------
                                                                      RANGE            MEDIAN
                                                              ---------------------   --------

Ratio of Enterprise Value to:
(a) Revenue for last 12 months ended March 31, 2001.........        -0.66x to 1.74x     0.26x
(b) Revenue for the year ended December 31, 2000............        -0.58x to 1.76x     0.24x
(c) Projected revenue for the year ending December 31,
  2001......................................................        -1.36x to 1.71x     0.24x
(d) Billable employee headcount at March 31, 2001...........  -$249,557 to $298,449   $37,671

    FBR noted that the multiples that were calculated for ARIS at the merger
price in effect at that time were above the median multiples derived for the
comparable companies in all cases. Using the data calculated with respect to the
comparable companies, FBR derived a reference range for the implied equity value
of ARIS of $20.60 million to $26.42 million.

    In presenting this analysis, FBR noted that the comparable companies used in
this analysis were reasonably similar to ARIS and CIBER insofar as they
participate in business segments similar to those of ARIS or CIBER, but noted
that none of these companies has the same technology, management, capital
structure, operations and combination of businesses and markets as ARIS or
CIBER.

PRECEDENT TRANSACTIONS ANALYSIS.

    Using publicly available information, FBR reviewed the terms of certain
announced, pending or completed industry transactions and compared statistics
for these transactions to relevant financial statistics received from ARIS.

    In performing its analysis, FBR examined an aggregate group of technology
merger or acquisition transactions ("Technology Comparable Transactions") with
announced transaction values between $57 million and $7.8 billion over the
fourteen months preceding June 7, 2001. FBR examined the premiums to the
announced acquisition price at periods of one day and one week prior to the
announcement date. Additionally, FBR selected industry transactions that
involved companies similar to ARIS ("IT Services Comparable Transactions") and
based on recent changes in the IT services market, selected a subgroup of these
transactions which: (a) were announced in the last six months; and (b) had
equity values of less than $400 million. FBR identified comparable transactions
that an investor could consider to be comparable, based on the acquiring or
acquired company or the transaction rationale.

    No company, business or transaction utilized in the comparable transaction
analysis is identical to ARIS, CIBER or the merger. Accordingly, FBR's analysis
involved complex considerations and judgments concerning differences in
financial and operating characteristics and other factors that could affect the
acquisition, public trading and other values of comparable companies, precedent
transactions or the business segment, company or transactions to which they were
being compared.

    FBR analyzed a sampling of 46 technology merger and acquisition transactions
since April 2000. In examining the Technology Comparable Transactions, FBR
analyzed the one day and seven day premiums paid using the announced transaction
value to calculate the premiums. The average one day premium for the Technology
Comparable Transactions was 29.82%, which implies a valuation of $29.48 million
for ARIS. The average seven day premium was 39.96%, which implied a valuation of
$29.87 million for ARIS.

    FBR also analyzed the consideration offered and the implied transaction
value multiples paid or proposed to be paid in ten selected IT Services
Comparable Transactions. These industry transactions were ten acquisitions of a
public company by another public company:

ACQUIRER                                              TARGET
- --------                               -------------------------------------

AnswerThink                            Think New Ideas
PSINet Inc.                            Metamor Worldwide Inc.
Commerce One Inc.                      AppNet Inc.
Schlumberger Ltd.                      Convergent Group Corp.
Silverline Technologies Ltd.           SeraNova Inc.
CGI Group Inc                          IMRglobal Corporation
Novell Inc.                            Cambridge Technology Partners Inc.
International Business Machines Corp.  Mainspring Inc.
Dimension Data Holdings Plc            Proxicom, Inc.
eXcelon Corporation                    C-bridge Internet Solutions Inc.

    In examining these transactions, FBR analyzed the multiples of offer prices
to revenues or projected revenues for the twelve month period preceding the
transaction and the year of the transaction. In addition, FBR analyzed the one
day and one week premiums of these transactions. The median revenue multiple for
the twelve month period prior to the transaction was 1.81x, which implied a
valuation of $120.71 million for ARIS. The median revenue multiple for the year
of the transaction was 2.44x, which implied a valuation of $159.15 million for
ARIS. The median one day premium for the IT Services Comparable Transactions was
32.70%, which implied a valuation of $30.13 million for ARIS. The median one
week premium was 46.25%, which implied a valuation of $31.22 million for ARIS.

    After analyzing the revenue multiples for the IT Services Comparable
Transactions, FBR noted that these multiples were significantly lower for
transactions that occurred in the six months preceding June 2001 that had equity
values of less than $400 million. FBR believed that these transactions provided
better evidence of the true value of ARIS, given changes in the capital markets,
decreases in the stock prices for IT services companies and decreased demand for
IT services. Therefore, FBR analyzed the consideration offered and the implied
transaction value multiples paid or proposed to be paid in three comparable
transactions that fit these criteria, the Recent IT Services Comparable
Transactions:

ACQUIRER                                              TARGET
- --------                               -------------------------------------

Novell Inc.                            Cambridge Technology Partners Inc.
International Business Machines Corp.  Mainspring Inc.
eXcelon Corporation                    C-bridge Internet Solutions Inc.

    In examining these transactions, FBR analyzed the multiples of offer prices
to revenues or projected revenues for the twelve month period preceding the
transaction and the year of the transaction. In addition, FBR analyzed the one
day and one week premiums of these transactions. The median revenue multiple for
the twelve month period prior to the transactions was 0.32x, which implied a
valuation of $30.30 million for ARIS. The median revenue multiple for the year
of the transaction was 0.32x, which implied a valuation of $30.16 million for
ARIS. The median one day premium for the IT Services Comparable Transactions was
32.89%, which implied a valuation of $30.18 million for ARIS. The median one
week premium was 61.19%, which implied a valuation of $34.41 million for ARIS.

    In presenting the results of its precedent transaction analysis, FBR noted
that the merger and acquisition transaction environment varies over time because
of, among other things, macroeconomic factors such as the availability of
financing and conditions in equity markets. In addition, no precedent

transaction reviewed was identical to the merger because of, among other things,
differences in the subject companies and the form of consideration paid. As a
result, FBR noted that an evaluation of the results of its precedent transaction
analyses necessarily involves judgments beyond the purely mathematical, such as
an assessment of macroeconomic factors and the evaluation of differences between
the financial and operating characteristics of the subject companies involved in
the precedent transactions, on the one hand, and those of ARIS and CIBER, on the
other hand.

DISCOUNTED CASH FLOW ANALYSES.

    Using cash flow projections provided by the management of ARIS, FBR
performed a discounted cash flow analysis with respect to the company, without
taking into account synergies forecasted by management to result from the
merger. Based on information concerning ARIS's weighted average cost of capital,
FBR utilized a range of discount rates from 31% to 39% for ARIS. Based on this
analysis, FBR derived a range for the implied equity value of ARIS of
$26.60 million to $33.14 million.

    The foregoing is a summary of the material financial analyses furnished by
FBR to the ARIS board of directors, but it does not purport to be a complete
description of the analyses performed by FBR or of its presentations to the ARIS
board of directors. The preparation of financial analyses and fairness opinions
is a complex process involving subjective judgments and is not necessarily
susceptible to partial analysis or summary description. FBR made no attempt to
assign specific weights to particular analyses or factors considered, but rather
made qualitative judgments as to the significance and relevance of the analyses
and factors considered. Accordingly, FBR believes that its analyses (and the
summary set forth above) must be considered as a whole, and that selecting
portions of the analyses and of the factors considered by FBR, without
considering all of such analyses and factors, could create a misleading or
incomplete view of the processes underlying the analyses conducted by FBR and
its opinion. In its analyses, FBR made numerous assumptions with respect to
ARIS, CIBER, industry performance, general business, economic, market and
financial conditions and other matters, many of which are beyond the control of
ARIS and CIBER. Any estimates contained in FBR's analyses are not necessarily
indicative of actual values or predictive of future results or values, which may
be significantly more or less favorable than those suggested by such analyses.
Estimates of values of companies do not purport to be appraisals or necessarily
to reflect the prices at which companies may actually be sold. Because these
estimates are inherently subject to uncertainty, none of ARIS, CIBER, the ARIS
board of directors, the CIBER board of directors, FBR or any other person
assumes responsibility if future results or actual values differ materially from
the estimates. FBR's analyses were prepared solely as part of FBR's analysis of
the fairness of the consideration to be received by the holders of ARIS common
stock and were provided to the ARIS board of directors in that connection. The
opinion of FBR was one of the factors taken into consideration by the ARIS board
of directors in making its determination to approve the merger agreement and the
merger.

    FBR is a nationally recognized investment banking firm engaged in, among
other things, the valuation of businesses and their securities in connection
with mergers and acquisitions, restructurings, negotiated underwritings,
competitive biddings, primary and secondary distributions of listed and unlisted
securities and private placements. ARIS selected FBR to act as its financial
advisor on the basis of FBR's national reputation and FBR's familiarity with
ARIS. FBR had previously been engaged by ARIS to provide financial advisory
services, for which it received approximately $20,000 of compensation solely in
connection with expenses FBR incurred. In addition, in the ordinary course of
business, FBR and its affiliates may actively trade the securities of ARIS and
CIBER for their own

accounts and for the accounts of customers and, accordingly, may at any time
hold a long or short position in such securities. FBR and its affiliates may
have other business and financial relationships with ARIS and CIBER.

    Pursuant to FBR's engagement letter, ARIS determined and has agreed to pay
FBR the following fees:

    (a) $187,500 upon the delivery of FBR's fairness opinion and the execution
of the definitive agreement; and

    (b) $62,500 upon the earliest to occur of the closing of the merger or the
termination of the definitive agreement.

    ARIS has also agreed to indemnify FBR against certain liabilities and
expenses relating to or arising out of its engagement, including certain
liabilities under the federal securities laws.

INTERESTS OF ARIS DIRECTORS AND OFFICERS IN THE MERGER

    When considering the recommendation of ARIS's board of directors, you should
be aware that certain ARIS directors and executive officers have interests in
the merger that are different from, or are in addition to, yours. The ARIS board
of directors was aware of these potential conflicts and considered them in
making their recommendation.

    Specifically, several ARIS officer, directors, and key employees have
executed change of control agreements with ARIS. These agreements will provide
benefits to those persons upon the final closing of the merger. These benefits
include the acceleration of ARIS stock options, the continuation of employee
benefits for up to one year, and severance payments.

    ARIS executives are expected to receive an aggregate total of $1,131,000 in
cash compensation severance payments and an acceleration of outstanding ARIS
stock options grants totaling approximately 869,000 shares of ARIS.

EQUITY GRANTS AND EMPLOYEE BENEFITS AFTER COMPLETION OF THE MERGER FOR ARIS
EMPLOYEES

ARIS OPTIONS

    ARIS's outstanding and unexercised stock options that have been issued to
employees pursuant to the ARIS Employee Stock Option Plans will be assumed by
CIBER as of the date of the merger and pursuant to the terms of the merger
agreement.

    ARIS has issued warrants to several third parties. The warrants grant rights
to purchase up to 285,727 shares of ARIS common stock. The warrants will survive
the closing of the merger, and will enable the warrant holders to purchase
117,148 shares of CIBER common stock, subject to adjustment, after the closing
of the merger and for the remaining life of the warrant.

NONEXECUTIVE OPTION GRANTS

    CIBER will make available a pool of non-statutory stock options to purchase
100,000 shares of CIBER Common Stock to be granted to certain employees of ARIS
who accept employment with CIBER. Options to purchase such shares will be
granted at the effective time of the merger, or as soon thereafter as
practicable, pursuant to option agreements in a form provided by CIBER. The
employees who are granted such options at the closing shall be determined by
mutual agreement of CIBER and ARIS prior to the effective time. The exercise
price of options granted will be the fair market value of the CIBER at the
effective time of the merger. The options shall vest over a period of four
(4) years, pursuant to the CIBER stock option plan.

EXECUTIVE OPTION GRANTS & SEVERANCE BENEFITS

    CIBER has approved the immediate participation of several ARIS executives in
a severance plan upon the completion of the merger. These ARIS executives will
receive severance benefits as provided for under change-in-control agreements
that have been executed between ARIS and the individual executives.

ARIS 401(K) PLAN

    CIBER will continue sponsorship of ARIS's 401(k) plan in its present form
following the completion of the merger until it is prepared to commence the
process of merging ARIS's plan into CIBER's plan. ARIS's 401(k) plan will be
closed to new contributions in preparation for the merger of the plans as of the
date ARIS employees first participate in CIBER's 401(k) plan.

ARIS HEALTH PLANS

    When the merger is final, CIBER will provide for the continuation of the
ARIS group health plan coverage. Such continuation of coverage shall (i) cause
any pre-existing conditions or limitations and eligibility waiting periods (only
to the extent such limitations or waiting periods did not apply to the ARIS
Employees under the Employee Plans) under any group health plans of CIBER to be
waived with respect to the ARIS employees and their eligible dependents and
(ii) give each ARIS employee credit for the plan year in which the Effective
Time occurs toward applicable deductibles and annual out-of-pocket limits for
expenses incurred prior to the Effective Time, and (iii) comply with
continuation of group coverage in accordance with the Consolidated Omnibus
Reconciliation Act ("COBRA") and Section 4980B of the Code, and the Health
Insurance Portability and Accounting Act ("HIPAA") in respect to each individual
who was an employee of ARIS or a spouse or dependent of any such employee, who
has subsequently become an employee of CIBER.

EXCHANGE OF ARIS STOCK CERTIFICATES FOR CIBER STOCK CERTIFICATES

    When the merger is completed, the exchange agent will mail to you a letter
of transmittal and instructions for surrendering your ARIS stock certificates in
exchange for CIBER stock certificates. When you deliver your ARIS stock
certificates to the exchange agent along with an executed letter of transmittal
and any other required documents, your ARIS stock certificates will be canceled
and you will receive the cash consideration and CIBER stock certificates
representing the number of full shares of CIBER common stock to which you are
entitled under the merger agreement. You will not receive any fractional shares
of CIBER common stock in the merger, but will instead receive cash equal to your
proportionate interest of the net proceeds from the sale of the aggregate
fractional shares on the NYSE by the exchange agent on your behalf of the
aggregate fractional shares.

    You should not submit your ARIS stock certificates for exchange until you
receive your instructions and a form of letter of transmittal from the exchange
agent.

    You are not entitled to receive any dividends or other distributions on
CIBER common stock until the merger is completed and you have surrendered your
ARIS stock certificates in exchange for CIBER stock certificates. Subject to the
effect of applicable laws, you will receive payment for any dividend or other
distribution on CIBER common stock with a record date after the merger and a
payment date prior to the date you surrender your ARIS stock certificates
promptly after your CIBER stock certificates are issued.

    CIBER will only issue you a CIBER stock certificate and/or a check in lieu
of a fractional share in a name other than the name in which a surrendered ARIS
stock certificate is registered if you present the exchange agent with all
documents required to show and effect the unrecorded transfer of ownership and
show that you paid any applicable stock transfer taxes. If your ARIS stock
certificate

has been lost, stolen or destroyed, you may need to deliver an affidavit and
bond prior to receiving your CIBER stock certificate.

    U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSEQUENCES OF THE MERGER

    The following summary discusses the material U.S. federal income tax
consequences of the merger to U.S. Holders of ARIS common stock.

    For purposes of this discussion, a U.S. Holder means:

    - A citizen or resident of the United States;

    - A corporation or other entity taxable as a corporation created or
      organized under the laws of the United States or any of its political
      subdivisions;

    - A trust, if a U.S. court is able to exercise primary supervision over the
      administration of the trust and one or more U.S. fiduciaries have the
      authority to control all substantial decisions of the trust; or

    - An estate that is subject to U.S. federal income tax on its income
      regardless of its source.

    This discussion is based upon the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended,
Treasury regulations, administrative ruling and judicial decisions currently in
effect, all of which are subject to change, possibly with retroactive effect.
The discussion assumes that ARIS shareholders hold their stock and will hold
their CIBER common stock as a capital asset within the meaning of Section 1221
of the Internal Revenue Code. Further, the discussion does not address all
aspects of U.S. federal income taxation that may be relevant to a particular
shareholder in light of his, her or its personal investment circumstances or to
shareholders subject to special treatment under the U.S. federal income tax
laws, including:

    - Insurance companies;

    - Tax-exempt organizations;

    - Dealers in securities or foreign currency;

    - Banks or trusts;

    - Persons that hold their ARIS stock as part of a straddle, a hedge against
      currency risk or a constructive sale or conversion transaction;

    - Persons that have a functional currency other than the U.S. dollar;

    - Investors in pass-through entities;

    - Shareholders who acquired their ARIS stock through the exercise of options
      or otherwise as compensation or through a tax-qualified retirement plan;
      or

    - Holders of options granted under any ARIS benefit plan.

    Furthermore, this discussion does not consider the potential effects of any
state, local or foreign tax laws.

    Neither ARIS nor CIBER has requested a ruling from the United States
Internal Revenue Service with respect to any of the U.S. federal income tax
consequences of the merger and, as a result, there can be no assurance that the
Internal Revenue Service will not disagree with or challenge any of the
conclusions described below.

    ARIS's and CIBER's obligations to complete the merger are conditioned upon
ARIS's receipt of opinions dated as of the closing of the merger from
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, a special tax advisor

to ARIS, and Davis Graham & Stubbs, LLP, counsel to CIBER, concluding that the
merger will likely constitute a reorganization within the meaning of
Section 368(a)(1)(A) of the Internal Revenue Code. These opinions will be based
upon then-existing law and will rely of certain facts, assumptions, limitations,
representations and covenants including those contained in certificates executed
by officers of ARIS and CIBER. Any change in then-applicable law, or failure of
any factual representations or assumptions to be true, correct and complete in
all material respects, could effect the continuing validity of the opinion of
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP and Davis Graham & Stubbs, LLP.

    Based on such tax opinions, the following tax consequences would likely
arise:

    - No gain or loss will be recognized by ARIS or CIBER.

    - Gain (but not loss) may be recognized by U.S. Holders of ARIS common stock
      on the exchange of their ARIS common stock for CIBER common stock and for
      cash (including both Cash Consideration and cash received in lieu of
      fractional shares of CIBER common stock) based upon the difference between
      the value of CIBER common stock and the amount of cash received by such
      U.S. Holder less the U.S. Holder's adjusted tax basis in his or her ARIS
      common stock (including fractional shares, when applicable); however, gain
      will only be recognized to the extent of cash received. Alternatively, the
      cash payment may be taxable as a dividend.

    - Gain or loss may be recognized by each U.S. Holder of ARIS stock who
      elects to be treated as a Dissenting Shareholder (who as a result of such
      election receive cash in complete liquidation of their ARIS common stock)
      in an amount equal to the difference between the U.S. Holder basis in his
      or her ARIS stock and the amount of cash received.

    - The aggregate adjusted basis of the CIBER common stock received in the
      merger by a U.S. Holder of ARIS common stock will be equal to the
      aggregate adjusted basis of the U.S. Holder's ARIS common stock exchanged
      for CIBER stock, increased by any gain recognized and decreased by the
      amount of cash received.

    - The holding period of the CIBER common stock received in the merger by a
      U.S. Holder of ARIS common stock will include the holding period of the
      U.S. Holder's ARIS common stock exchanged for CIBER common stock.

    - If the cash payment is not taxable as a dividend, gain or loss recognized
      by U.S. Holders of ARIS common stock as a result of the merger will
      constitute long-term capital gain or loss if the U.S. Holder's holding
      period is greater than 12 months as of the date of the merger.

    If the Internal Revenue Service were to successfully challenge the status of
the merger as a reorganization, the tax consequences to U.S. Holders of ARIS
common stock as described above would not, in general, apply. In such event,
U.S. Holders of ARIS common stock would be required to recognize gain or loss as
a result of the merger in an amount equal to the difference between the U.S.
Holder's basis in ARIS common stock and the fair market value (as of the closing
of the merger) of the shares of CIBER common stock and any other consideration
received.

    The summary of U.S. federal income tax consequences is intended to provide
only a general summary and is not intended to be a complete analysis or
description of all potential federal income tax consequences of the merger. In
addition, the summary does not address tax consequences that may vary with, or
are contingent on, individual circumstances. Moreover, the summary does not
address any non-income tax or any foreign, state or local tax consequences of
the merger. The summary does not address the tax consequences of any transaction
other than the merger. Accordingly, each ARIS shareholder is strongly urged to
consult with a tax advisor to determine the particular federal, state, local or
foreign income or other tax consequences of the merger to the holder.

ACCOUNTING TREATMENT OF THE MERGER

    CIBER intends to account for the merger as a purchase.

RESTRICTIONS ON SALES OF SHARES BY AFFILIATES OF ARIS AND CIBER

    The shares of CIBER common stock to be issued in connection with the merger
will be registered under the Securities Act and will be freely transferable
under the Securities Act, except for shares of CIBER common stock issued to any
person who is deemed to be an "affiliate" of either CIBER or ARIS. Persons who
may be deemed affiliates include individuals or entities that control, are
controlled by, or are under common control with such other person and may
include some of ARIS's executive officers and directors, as well as ARIS's
respective principal shareholders. Affiliates may not sell their shares of CIBER
common stock acquired in connection with the merger except pursuant to:

    - an effective registration statement under the Securities Act covering the
      resale of those shares;

    - an exemption under paragraph (d) of Rule 145 under the Securities Act; or

    - any other applicable exemption under the Securities Act.

    CIBER's registration statement on Form S-4, of which this proxy
statement/prospectus forms a part, does not cover the resale of shares of CIBER
common stock to be received by ARIS affiliates in the merger.

LISTING ON THE NYSE OF CIBER COMMON STOCK TO BE ISSUED IN THE MERGER

    CIBER will have the shares of CIBER common stock to be issued in the merger
approved for listing on the NYSE subject to official notice of issuance.

DELISTING AND DEREGISTRATION OF ARIS COMMON STOCK AFTER THE MERGER

    When the merger is completed, ARIS common stock will be delisted from the
Nasdaq National Market and will be deregistered under the Securities and
Exchange Act.

DISSENTERS' RIGHTS

    Under Washington law, ARIS shareholders have the right to dissent from the
merger and to receive payment in cash for the fair value of their shares of ARIS
common stock. To preserve their rights, ARIS shareholders who wish to exercise
their statutory dissenters' rights must deliver to ARIS before the special
meeting written notice of their intent to demand payment for their shares of
ARIS common stock if the merger is effected and not vote their shares in favor
of approval of the merger agreement.

    CHAPTER 13 OF THE WASHINGTON BUSINESS CORPORATION ACT IS REPRINTED IN ITS
ENTIRETY IN ANNEX C TO THIS PROXY STATEMENT/PROSPECTUS. THE FOLLOWING DISCUSSION
IS A SUMMARY OF THE MATERIAL TERMS OF THE LAW RELATING TO DISSENTERS' RIGHTS AND
IS QUALIFIED IN ITS ENTIRETY BY REFERENCE TO ANNEX C. ARIS SHAREHOLDERS SHOULD
REVIEW THIS DISCUSSION AND ANNEX C CAREFULLY IF THEY WISH TO EXERCISE STATUTORY
DISSENTERS' RIGHTS, OR PRESERVE THEIR RIGHT TO DISSENT BECAUSE FAILURE TO COMPLY
WITH THE PROCEDURES SET FORTH IN THIS DISCUSSION AND IN THE STATUTE WILL RESULT
IN THE LOSS OF DISSENTERS' RIGHTS.

    An ARIS shareholder who wishes to exercise dissenters' rights generally must
dissent with respect to all of the shares that he or she owns or over which he
or she has power to direct the vote. However, if a record shareholder is a
nominee for several beneficial shareholders, some of whom wish to dissent and
some of whom do not, then the record shareholder may dissent with respect to all
the shares beneficially owned by any one person by notifying ARIS in writing of
the name and address of each person on whose behalf the record shareholder
asserts dissenters' rights. A beneficial shareholder may assert dissenters'
rights directly by submitting to ARIS the record shareholder's written consent
to the

dissent and by dissenting with respect to all the shares of which the
shareholder is the beneficial shareholder or over which the shareholder has
power to direct the vote.

    A shareholder who does not deliver to ARIS prior to the vote being taken at
the special shareholder meeting a written notice of the shareholder's intent to
demand payment for the fair value of the shares will lose the right to exercise
dissenters' rights. Notice must be sent to ARIS at 2229 112th Avenue NE
Bellevue, WA 98004-2936. In addition, any shareholder electing to exercise
dissenters' rights must not vote in favor of approval of the merger agreement.

    If the merger is effected, ARIS will, within 10 days after the effective
time, deliver a written notice to all shareholders who properly perfected their
dissenters' rights. This notice will, among other things:

    - state where the payment demand must be sent and where and when
      certificates must be deposited;

    - supply a form for demanding payment, which requires shareholders to
      certify that they acquired beneficial ownership of the shares before the
      date on which the merger was first announced;

    - set a date by which ARIS must receive the payment demand, which date will
      be between 30 and 60 days after ARIS delivers the notice to dissenting
      shareholders;

    - include another copy of Chapter 13 of the Washington Business Corporation
      Act; and

    - inform any shareholders wishing to exercise dissenters' rights that they
      must file the payment demand, certify as to whether beneficial ownership
      of the shares was acquired before the merger was announced, and deliver
      share certificates, in the manner and by the time set forth in the notice.
      Failure to do so will cause such shareholder to lose his or her
      dissenters' rights.

    Within 30 days after the later of the effective time and the date the
payment demand is received by ARIS, ARIS will pay each dissenter with properly
perfected dissenters' rights ARIS's estimate of the fair value of the
shareholder's shares, plus accrued interest from the effective time. If
dissenters' rights are exercised and perfected with respect to more than five
percent of the outstanding shares of ARIS common stock, then CIBER will pay the
applicable amounts. ARIS will provide, along with this payment:

    - financial information relating to ARIS, including ARIS's balance sheet,
      income statement and statement of changes in shareholders' equity for or
      as of a fiscal year ending not more than 16 months before the date of
      payment and its latest available interim financial statements, if any;

    - an explanation of how ARIS estimated the fair value of the shares;

    - an explanation of how the accrued interest was calculated, a statement of
      a dissenter's right to demand further payment if he or she is dissatisfied
      with the tendered payment; and

    - another copy of Chapter 13 of the Washington Business Corporation Act.

    With respect to a dissenter who did not beneficially own ARIS shares prior
to the public announcement of the merger, ARIS is required to send an offer to
make payment to the dissenter, conditioned upon the dissenter's agreement to
accept the payment in full satisfaction of the dissenter's demands.

    A dissenter dissatisfied with ARIS's estimate of the fair value may, within
30 days of payment or offer for payment by ARIS or CIBER's of ARIS's estimate of
the fair value of the shareholder's shares, notify ARIS in writing of the
shareholder's estimate of fair value of his or her shares and the amount of
interest due, and demand payment of his or her estimate of fair value of his or
her shares. If ARIS does not accept the dissenter's estimate and the parties do
not otherwise settle on a fair value, Washington law requires that, within
60 days of the dissenter's demand for further payment, ARIS start

a proceeding in King County Superior Court, and petition the court to determine
the fair value of the shares and accrued interest, naming all the ARIS
dissenting shareholders whose demands remain unsettled as parties to the
proceeding. The court may appoint one or more persons as appraisers to receive
evidence and recommend the fair value of the ARIS shares. The dissenters will be
entitled to the same discovery rights as parties in the other civil actions.
Each dissenter made a party to the proceeding will be entitled to judgment for
the amount, if any, by which the court finds the fair value of his or her
shares, plus accrued interest, exceeds the amount, if any, previously paid to
the dissenter by ARIS or CIBER's. If ARIS fails to institute a court action
within the specified time period, it or CIBER's must pay the amount specified in
the dissenter's demand.

    Court costs and appraisers' fees will be assessed against ARIS, except that
the court may assess these costs against some or all of the dissenters to the
extent that the court finds the dissenters acted arbitrarily, vexatiously or not
in good faith in demanding payment. The court may also assess the fees and
expenses of counsel and experts of the respective parties in amounts that the
court finds equitable against ARIS, if the court finds that ARIS did not
substantially comply with certain provisions of Washington law concerning
dissenters' rights, or against either the dissenter or ARIS, if the court finds
that the party against whom the fees and expenses are assessed acted
arbitrarily, vexatiously or not in good faith. If the court finds that services
of counsel for any dissenter were of substantial benefit to other dissenters
similarly situated, and that the fees should not be assessed against ARIS, the
court may award to this dissenter's counsel reasonable fees to be paid out of
the amounts awarded to all dissenters who benefited from the proceedings.

    A shareholder entitled to dissent and obtain payment for his or her shares
of ARIS common stock under Washington law may not challenge the merger unless
ARIS fails to comply with the procedural requirements imposed by the Washington
law, the ARIS articles of incorporation or the ARIS bylaws or is fraudulent with
respect to the ARIS shareholder.

    ARIS shareholders who dissent from the merger will generally recognize
taxable gain or loss for federal income tax purposes. See "--U.S. Federal Income
Tax Consequences of the Merger."

    In view of the complexity of Chapter 13 of the Washington Business
Corporation Act, ARIS shareholders who may wish to dissent from the merger and
pursue dissenters' rights should consult their legal advisors.

    It is a condition to the closing of the merger that holders of no more than
10% of the ARIS common stock shall have exercised their dissenters' rights.

                              THE MERGER AGREEMENT

    A description of the material terms of the merger agreement by and between
CIBER and ARIS follows. Please read the entire merger agreement, which is
attached to proxy statement/prospectus and as Annex A. This summary is qualified
in its entirety by reference to the full text of the merger agreement.

THE MERGER

    At the closing of the merger, ARIS will merge with and into CIBER. As a
result of the merger, CIBER will be the surviving corporation, and ARIS will no
longer exist as a separate entity.

CERTIFICATE OF INCORPORATION AND BYLAWS OF ARIS AFTER THE MERGER

    At the closing of the merger, the certificate of incorporation and the
bylaws of CIBER will become the certificate of incorporation and the bylaws of
the surviving corporation.

DIRECTORS AND OFFICERS OF ARIS AFTER THE MERGER

    At the closing of the merger, the directors and officers of CIBER will be
the directors of the surviving corporation.

EFFECT OF MERGER ON CAPITAL STOCK OF ARIS

    At the closing of the merger, each share of common stock of ARIS issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the merger will be automatically converted into
the right to receive $1.30 in cash and .220 of a share of CIBER common stock,
subject to adjustments. No fractional shares of CIBER common stock will be
issued in the merger. Instead, each holder of a fractional share will receive an
amount of cash (rounded to the nearest whole cent) equal to the product obtained
by multiplying (x) such fraction of a share of CIBER Common Stock by (y) the
dollar value of the Merger Consideration per share. All outstanding unexercised
options and warrants to acquire ARIS common stock will upon the closing of the
merger be assumed and replaced by CIBER, pursuant to the terms of the merger
agreement. For a description of equity grants to be made to ARIS employees
following the merger, see the discussion on page 27 of this proxy
statement/prospectus.

PROCEDURE FOR EXCHANGING ARIS COMMON STOCK FOR CIBER COMMON STOCK

    The merger agreement requires CIBER, as of the closing of the merger, to
deposit with CIBER's selected exchange agent, for the benefit of holders of
shares of ARIS common stock, certificates representing the shares of CIBER
common stock to be issued in the merger and cash sufficient to pay the cash
portion of the merger consideration. When the merger is completed, the exchange
agent will mail to you a letter of transmittal and instructions for surrendering
your ARIS stock certificates in exchange for CIBER stock certificates, the cash
consideration, cash in lieu of fractional shares and any dividends or
distributions that may be issuable.

REGULATORY FILINGS

    The merger agreement contains various covenants and agreements regarding
preparation of regulatory filings that are customary in transactions of this
nature, including:

    - CIBER and ARIS have agreed to prepare and cause to be filed with the
      Securities and Exchange Commission a registration statement on Form S-4,
      including this proxy statement/ prospectus, and to cooperate and promptly
      provide information to each other as required or appropriate for inclusion
      in the registration statement;

    - CIBER and ARIS have agreed to respond to any comments of the staff of the
      Securities and Exchange Commission and to use commercially reasonable
      efforts to have the registration statement on Form S-4 declared effective
      under the Securities Act as promptly as practicable after it is filed;

    - ARIS has agreed to cause this proxy statement/prospectus to be mailed out
      to its shareholders at the earliest practicable time after the S-4 is
      declared effective;

    - CIBER and ARIS have agreed to prepare and file any other filings relating
      to the merger required to be filed under applicable law;

    - CIBER and ARIS have agreed to notify each other promptly upon receipt of

      authorities under the Hart-Scott Rodino Act.

    - CIBER and ARIS have agreed to notify each other of any event that is

      filing, and to cooperate in filing any amendment or supplement with the
      appropriate regulatory body and, if appropriate, in mailing the amendment
      or supplement to ARIS shareholders; and

    - ARIS has agreed to cause this proxy statement/prospectus to include the
      recommendation of its board of directors in favor of adoption and approval
      of the merger agreement and approval of the merger, subject to specified
      exceptions.

SPECIAL MEETING OF ARIS SHAREHOLDERS

    ARIS has agreed to convene a special meeting of ARIS shareholders as
promptly as practicable after the registration statement on Form S-4 is declared
effective, and, unless ARIS's board of directors has withdrawn its
recommendation of the merger agreement and the merger, to use its commercially
reasonable efforts to solicit and secure from its shareholders at the meeting
the adoption and approval of the merger agreement and the merger. ARIS has also
agreed that its board of directors will recommend that its shareholders vote in
favor of and adopt and approve the merger agreement and the merger, and that
this recommendation will not be withdrawn or modified in a manner adverse to
CIBER, subject to specified exceptions.

    Nothing in the merger agreement prevents the ARIS board of directors from
withdrawing or changing its recommendation in favor of the merger if the board
reasonably concludes in good faith, after consultation with its outside counsel
and other appropriate advisors, and based upon such information and opinions as
it deems appropriate under the circumstances, that it has received a Superior
Proposal, and that the failure to so withdraw or change its recommendation would
be inconsistent with its fiduciary obligations.

NON-SOLICITATION BY ARIS

    ARIS has agreed not to solicit, initiate or encourage an Acquisition
Proposal, or subject in the case of ARIS, to the fiduciary duties of its board
of directors under applicable law as advised by counsel to ARIS, with a view to
pursuing an Acquisition Proposal with any person, (x) engage in negotiations
with, or (y) disclose any nonpublic information relating to ARIS, or (z) afford
access to the properties, books or records of ARIS to, any such person. However,
the board of directors continues to be bound by it fiduciary duties to the ARIS
shareholders. An Acquisition Proposal means any proposal from any third person
proposing a business combination with ARIS.

    In the event that ARIS is approached by a third party with an Acquisition
Proposal, ARIS has agreed to promptly notify CIBER of the of the terms and
conditions of the proposal and the identity of the person making proposal.

TREATMENT OF ARIS STOCK OPTIONS AND CONTINGENT OBLIGATION TO ISSUE SHARES

    All unexercised and outstanding stock options issued to employees pursuant
to ARIS's employee stock option plans will be assumed by CIBER as of the date of
the merger and pursuant to the terms of the merger agreement. For a discussion
of equity grants to be made to ARIS employees and some directors following the
merger, see the discussion on page 27 of this proxy statement/prospectus.

ARIS'S EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS

    To the extent that ARIS employees accept employment from CIBER, such
employees shall be able to participate in benefit plans in which similarly
situated CIBER employees participate.

    CIBER has agreed to continue sponsorship of ARIS's 401(k) plan in its
present form until the ARIS plan may be merged into the CIBER plan. ARIS's
401(k) plan shall be frozen to new contributions in preparation for the merger
of the two plans.

    CIBER will make a pool of non-statutory stock options to purchase 100,000
shares of CIBER available. These options will be granted to certain employees
who accept employment with CIBER.

    CIBER will maintain existing group health plan coverage to the extent
required under the applicable law.

INDEMNIFICATION

    Pursuant to the terms of the merger agreement, all rights to indemnification
that exist in favor of ARIS directors and officers prior to the merger date will
continue and be observed by CIBER after the merger for a period of six years. In
addition, CIBER has agreed to maintain in effect and for the benefit of the
Indemnified Persons, with respect to acts occurring prior to the Effective Time,
the existing ARIS directors' and officers' liability insurance liability
policies, subject to certain limitations.

PAYMENT OF TERMINATION FEE

    Under the following situations, if the merger is not completed, CIBER or
ARIS maybe required to pay a termination fee under the agreement. In the event
that this Agreement is terminated by CIBER because ARIS solicits other offers or
ARIS determines that a Superior Proposal exists and the ARIS Board of Director
determines it is in the best interest of ARIS to not finalize the transaction or

merger in a manner adverse to CIBER or recommends an Acquisition Proposal, then
ARIS shall pay to CIBER a termination fee of $1,500,000.

CIBER would pay to ARIS $2,500,000 as the sole and exclusive remedy of ARIS.

warranties and waive compliance by the other with any of the agreements or
conditions contained in the merger agreement.

                                OTHER AGREEMENTS

VOTING AGREEMENTS

    As an inducement to CIBER to enter into the merger agreement, Kendall Kunz,
ARIS's president and chief executive officer, and Paul Song, Chairman and
founder of ARIS, and his family interests, have executed voting agreements in
favor of CIBER, and have agreed to vote their shares of ARIS common stock in
favor of the merger. These individuals hold approximately 35% of ARIS's
outstanding common stock as of the record date. By entering into the voting
agreements, these ARIS shareholders have appointed CIBER as their proxy. These
proxies give CIBER the limited right to vote the shares of ARIS common stock
beneficially owned by these ARIS shareholder, including shares of ARIS common
stock acquired after the date of the voting agreements:

    - in favor of the approval and adoption of the merger agreement, the merger,
      each of the other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, any
      other action required in furtherance of the merger; and

    - against any proposal made in opposition to, or in competition with,
      consummation of the merger and the other transactions contemplated by the
      merger agreement; and any merger, asset sale, reorganization,
      recapitalization, dissolution or any other action intended, or which could
      reasonably be expected, to impede, interfere with or otherwise adversely
      affect the consummation of the merger and the other transactions
      contemplated by the merger agreement.

    These ARIS shareholders may vote their shares of ARIS common stock on all
other matters.

    The ARIS shareholder voting agreements will terminate upon the earlier to
occur of the completion of the merger or termination of the merger agreement.

           CIBER, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES UNAUDITED PRO FORMA CONDENSED
                              FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

    The unaudited pro forma information set forth below gives effect to the
merger of ARIS into CIBER as if it had been completed on January 1, 2000 for
purposes of the statements of operations, and as if it had been completed on
March 31, 2001 for balance sheet purposes. The pro forma condensed financial
statements are derived from the historical financial statements of CIBER and
ARIS.

    CIBER will account for the merger under the purchase method of accounting.
Accordingly, CIBER will establish a new basis for ARIS's assets and liabilities
based upon the fair values thereof and the CIBER purchase price, including costs
of the merger. The purchase accounting adjustments made in connection with the
development of the pro forma condensed financial statements are preliminary and
have been made solely for the purposes of developing such pro forma financial
information and are based upon the assumptions described in the notes hereto.
The pro forma adjustments do not reflect any operating efficiencies and cost
savings that may be achieved with respect to the combined companies nor any
adjustments to expenses for any future operating changes. Upon the closing of
the merger, CIBER may incur integration related expenses not reflected in the
pro forma financial statements such as the elimination of duplicate facilities,
operational realignment and workforce reductions. The following pro forma
financial information is not necessarily indicative of the financial position or
operating results that would have occurred had the merger been completed on the
dates discussed above.

    CIBER is unaware of events, other than those disclosed in the pro forma
notes that would require a material change to the preliminary purchase price
allocation. However, a final determination of the required purchase accounting
adjustments will be made upon completion of the merger. Assuming completion of
the merger, the actual financial position and results of operations will differ,
perhaps significantly, from the pro forma amounts reflected herein because of a
variety of factors, including access to additional information, changes in value
not currently identified and changes in operating results between the dates of
the pro forma financial information and the date on which the merger takes
place.

1.  These columns reflect the historical results of operations and financial
    position of the respective companies.

2.  This adjustment reflects the acquisition of ARIS and the allocation of the
    excess of the total of the values assigned to ARIS's net assets over the
    consideration paid for the net assets acquired, including the costs of the
    transaction (negative goodwill). For the purpose of these pro forma
    financial statements, the consideration has been calculated assuming CIBER
    will acquire all of the outstanding shares of ARIS in exchange for a
    combination of $1.30 in cash and .220 of a share of CIBER common stock for
    each outstanding share of ARIS common stock. The exchange represents $2.78
    per ARIS share or an aggregate offer value of $31.4 million based on the
    $6.71 closing price of CIBER shares on June 13, 2001. CIBER expects to issue
    approximately 2.5 million shares. The actual consideration is subject to
    adjustment as provided in the merger agreement.

    All outstanding options and warrants to purchase shares of ARIS common stock
    will be exchanged for options and warrants to purchase shares of CIBER
    common stock. As part of the purchase price, CIBER will record the
    replacement options and warrants issued, at their fair value by using the
    Black-Scholes option pricing model.

    This adjustment reflects the reduction of ARIS's assets and liabilities to
fair value (in thousands):

    Upon closing of the merger, the actual adjustment to the fair value of
    ARIS's assets and liabilities will be allocated to its property and
    equipment and other assets. A preliminary allocation of the purchase price
    has been made to certain identifiable tangible and intangible assets and
    liabilities of ARIS, including deferred income tax impacts, based on
    information available to management at the date of the preparation of the
    accompanying pro forma condensed financial information. Preliminary negative
    goodwill has been allocated to certain long-term assets based on their
    estimated relative fair values. Because of the tax-free nature of the
    merger, ARIS's historical tax basis has not been adjusted for the decrease
    in fair value of ARIS's property and equipment, which has resulted in an
    additional deferred tax assets.

3.  Represents the liquidation of ARIS's historical investments.

4.  Represents the elimination of ARIS's historical shareholders' equity
    accounts.

 NOTES TO UNAUDITED CIBER PRO FORMA CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)

5.  Represents the decrease in depreciation expense resulting from the reduction
    in property and equipment.

6.  Represents the elimination of ARIS's historical intangible amortization.

7.  Represents an adjustment to decrease interest income to reflect the forgone
    interest on the cash used to fund the cash consideration to be paid in the
    merger. The adjustment to interest was calculated using an interest rate of
    6.5% for the year ended December 31, 2000 and for the three months ended
    March 31, 2001.

8.  Represents the income tax effect of the pro forma adjustments assuming a 40%
    effective tax rate, giving affect to non-deductible amortization.

9.  Represents the incremental weighted average shares to be issued in the

                      DESCRIPTION OF CIBER'S CAPITAL STOCK

AUTHORIZED CAPITAL STOCK

    CIBER's authorized capital stock consists of 100,000,000 shares of common
stock, par value $.01, and 5,000,000 shares of preferred stock, par value $0.01.
As of March 31, 2001 approximately 59,582,000 shares of CIBER's common stock and
no shares of preferred stock were outstanding.

CIBER COMMON STOCK

    The holders of CIBER common stock are entitled to one vote for each share on
all matters voted on by stockholders, including elections of directors, and,
except as otherwise required by law or provided in any resolution adopted by
CIBER's board of directors with respect to any series of preferred stock (a
"preferred stock designation"), the holders of CIBER's common stock will possess
all of the voting power. CIBER's certificate of incorporation does not provide
for cumulative voting in the election of directors. Subject to any preferential
rights of any outstanding series of CIBER's preferred stock created by CIBER's
board of directors from time to time, the holders of CIBER's common stock will
be entitled to the dividends as may be declared from time to time by CIBER's
board of directors from funds legally available for dividends, and, upon
liquidation, will be entitled to receive pro rata all assets available for
distribution to the holders of CIBER's common stock. CIBER's certificate of
incorporation does not provide for the holders of common stock to have
preemptive, subscription, or redemption rights.

CIBER PREFERRED STOCK

    CIBER's certificate of incorporation authorizes its board of directors to
establish one or more series of preferred stock and to determine, with respect
to any series of preferred stock, the terms and rights of such series,
including, but not limited to:

    - the designation of the series;

    - the number of shares of the series, which number CIBER's board of
      directors may later, except where otherwise provided in the preferred
      stock designation, increase or decrease, but not below the number of
      shares thereof then outstanding;

    - whether dividends, if any, will be cumulative or non-cumulative, and, in
      the case of shares of any series having cumulative dividend rights, the
      date or dates or method of determining the date or dates from which
      dividends on the shares of the series having cumulative dividend rights
      shall be cumulative;

    - the rate of any dividends, or method of determining the dividends, payable
      to the holders of the shares of the series, any conditions upon which the
      dividends will be paid and the date or dates or the method for determining
      the date or dates upon which the dividends will be payable;

    - the redemption rights and price or prices, if any, for shares of the
      series;

    - the terms and amounts of any sinking fund provided for the purchase or
      redemption of shares of the series;

    - the amounts payable on and the preferences, if any, of shares of the
      series in the event of any voluntary or involuntary liquidation,
      dissolution or winding up of our affairs;

    - whether the shares of the series will be convertible or exchangeable into
      shares of any other class or series, or any other security, of CIBER or
      any other corporation, and, if so, the specification of the other class or
      series or the other security, the conversion or exchange price or prices
      or rate or rates, any adjustments thereof, the date or dates as of which
      the shares will

      be convertible or exchangeable and all other terms and conditions upon
      which the conversion or exchange may be made;

    - restrictions on the issuance of shares of the same series or of any other
      class or series; and

    - the voting rights, if any, of the holders of the shares of the series.

    CIBER believes that the ability of its board of directors to issue one or
more series of preferred stock provides it with flexibility in structuring
possible future financing and acquisitions, and in meeting other corporate needs
that might arise. The authorized shares of CIBER's preferred stock, as well as
shares of CIBER common stock, will be available for issuance without further
action by CIBER's stockholders unless required by applicable law or the rules of
any stock exchange or automated quotation system on which our securities may be
listed or traded. The New York Stock Exchange currently requires stockholder
approval as a prerequisite to listing shares in several instances, including
where the present or potential issuance of shares could result in an increase of
at least 20% in the number of outstanding shares of common stock, or in the
amount of voting securities, outstanding. If the approval of CIBER's
stockholders is not required for the issuance of shares of CIBER's preferred
stock or common stock, CIBER's board of directors may determine not to seek
stockholder approval.

    Although CIBER believes its board of directors will have no intention of
immediately doing so, it could issue a series of preferred stock that could,
depending on the terms of the series, impede the completion of a merger, tender
offer or other takeover attempt. CIBER's board of directors will make any
determination to issue the shares of preferred stock based on its judgment as to
the best interests of CIBER's stockholders. CIBER's board of directors, in so
acting, could issue preferred stock having terms that could discourage an
acquisition attempt through which an acquirer may be able to change the
composition of CIBER's board of directors, including a tender offer or other
transaction that some, or a majority, of CIBER's stockholders might believe to
be in their best interests or in which CIBER's stockholders might receive a
premium for their stock over the then-current market price of CIBER's common
stock.

              COMPARISON OF RIGHTS OF HOLDERS OF ARIS COMMON STOCK
                             AND CIBER COMMON STOCK

    Upon consummation of the merger, some or all ARIS's shareholders will become
shareholders of CIBER and their rights will be governed by the CIBER charter and
the CIBER bylaws, which differ in certain material respects from the ARIS
Corporation charter and the ARIS bylaws. As stockholders of CIBER, the rights of
former ARIS shareholders will also be governed by the Delaware General
Corporation Law instead of the Washington Business Corporation Act. Delaware is
the jurisdiction of incorporation of CIBER and Washington is the jurisdiction of
incorporation of ARIS.

    The following comparison of the Delaware General Corporation Law, the CIBER
charter and the CIBER bylaws, on the one hand, and the Washington Business
Corporation Act, ARIS charter and the ARIS bylaws, on the other hand, summarizes
the material differences but is not intended to list all differences. Note that
throughout the proxy statement/prospectus the terms shareholder and stockholder
are both used. Under Washington State law a holder of capital stock is called a
shareholder. Under Delaware law a holder of capital stock is called a
stockholder.

BUSINESS COMBINATIONS

    Under the Washington Business Corporation Act, approval of a merger or share
exchange or sale of all or substantially all of the assets of a corporation
requires the affirmative vote of at least two thirds of all outstanding stock
entitled to vote at the shareholders meeting.

    Generally, under the Delaware General Corporation Law, the approval by the
affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the outstanding stock (or, if
the certificate of incorporation provides for more or less than one vote per
share, a majority of the votes of the outstanding stock) of a corporation
entitled to vote on the matter is required for a merger or consolidation or
sale, lease or exchange of all or substantially all the corporation's assets to
be consummated.

STATE TAKEOVER LEGISLATION

    The Washington Takeover Act prohibits a person or persons acting in concert
from engaging in certain prohibited transactions for a period of five (5) years
from the date that the acquiring person acquires a ten percent ownership
interest in a company covered by the Washington Takeover Act.

    The Washington Takeover Act protects companies incorporated in Washington as
well as those incorporated in other jurisdictions. Every Washington corporation
is protected if the corporation has a class of voting securities registered
pursuant to Section 12 or 15 of the 1934 Act, or if the corporation has amended
its articles of incorporation to make the corporation subject to the Washington
Takeover Act. As ARIS is a Washington corporation, and has a class of securities
registered pursuant to Section 12 of the 1934 Act, it is protected by the
Washington Takeover Act.

    The Washington Takeover Act is self-executing: once an acquiring person
acquires more than a ten percent interest, the target corporation cannot engage
in certain enumerated prohibited transactions for a period of five (5) years.
Any transaction that violates this prohibition is void. Prohibited transactions
include: merger, consolidation or the target corporation with an acquiring
person; the disposal of the target corporation's assets; the liquidation or
dissolution of the target corporation pursuant to an agreement with the
acquiring person; and receipt by the acquiring person of a direct or indirect
benefit derived from their acquisition, other than one in proportion to their
share ownership.

    In order to enter into a transaction that is not prohibited by the
Washington Takeover Act, a potential acquiring person needs to seek board
approval of the transaction before acquiring more than a ten percent interest in
the target corporation. This means that even a new board, elected by an
acquiring person cannot approve a prohibited transaction.

    Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, in general, prohibits a
business combination between a corporation and an interested stockholder within
three years of the time such stockholder became an interested stockholder,
unless:

    - prior to such time the board of directors of the corporation approved
      either the business combination or the transaction that resulted in the
      stockholder becoming an interested stockholder;

    - upon consummation of the transaction that resulted in the stockholder
      becoming an interested stockholder, the interested stockholder owned at
      least 85% of the voting stock of the corporation outstanding at the time
      the transaction commenced, exclusive of shares owned by directors who are
      also officers and by certain employee stock plans; or

    - at or subsequent to such time, the business combination is approved by the
      board of directors and authorized by the affirmative vote at a
      stockholders' meeting of at least 66 2/3% of the outstanding voting stock
      which is not owned by the interested stockholder.

    The term "business combination" is defined to include, among other
transactions between the interested stockholder and the corporation or any
direct or indirect majority owned subsidiary thereof, a merger or consolidation;
a sale, pledge, transfer or other disposition (including as part of a
dissolution) of assets having an aggregate market value equal to 10% or more of
either the aggregate market value of all assets of the corporation on a
consolidated basis or the aggregate market value of all the outstanding stock of
the corporation; certain transactions that would increase the interested
stockholder's proportionate share ownership of the stock of any class or series
of the corporation or such subsidiary; and any receipt by the interested
stockholder of the benefit of any loans, advances, guarantees, pledges or other
financial benefits provided by or through the corporation or any such
subsidiary. In general, and subject to certain exceptions, an "interested
stockholder" is any person who is the owner of 15% or more of the outstanding
voting stock of the corporation, and the affiliates and associates of such
person. The term "owner" is broadly defined to include any person that
individually or with or through such person's affiliates or associates, among
other things, beneficially owns such stock, or has the right to acquire such
stock (whether such right is exercisable immediately or only after the passage
of time) pursuant to any agreement or understanding or upon the exercise of
warrants or options or otherwise or has the right to vote such stock pursuant to
any agreement or understanding, or has an agreement or understanding with the
beneficial owner of such stock for the purpose of acquiring, holding, voting or
disposing of such stock.

    The restrictions of Section 203 do not apply to corporations that have
elected, in the manner provided therein, not to be subject to Section 203 or,
with certain exceptions, which do not have a class of voting stock that is
listed on a national securities exchange or authorized for quotation on the
Nasdaq National Market tier of The Nasdaq Stock Market or held of record by more
than 2,000 stockholders.

RIGHTS OF DISSENTING SHAREHOLDERS

    Under the Washington Business Corporation Act, shareholders of a corporation
that consummate certain transactions have the right to demand and receive
payment for the fair value of their stock. The applicable transactions are:
merger, including the merger of a majority owned subsidiary into the parent
under certain circumstances; share exchange; sale of assets; and reverse stock
split. In addition a corporation may voluntarily expand dissenters rights by
board resolution or in its articles of incorporation or bylaws.

    Generally, all holders of a corporation's capital stock entitled to vote for
approval of these enumerated transactions are entitled to exercise dissenter's
rights. The burden to prove fair value rests on the corporation.

    Under the Delaware General Corporation Law, except as otherwise provided by
the Delaware General Corporation Law, stockholders of a constituent corporation
in a merger or consolidation have the right to demand and receive payment of the
fair value of their stock in a merger or consolidation. However, except as
otherwise provided by the Delaware General Corporation Law, stockholders do not
have appraisal rights in a merger or consolidation if, among other things, their
shares are:

    - listed on a national securities exchange or designated as a national
      market system security on an inter-dealer quotation system by the National
      Association of Securities Dealers, Inc.; or

    - held of record by more than 2,000 stockholders;

and, in each case, the consideration such stockholders receive for their shares
in a merger or consolidation consists solely of:

    - shares of stock of the corporation surviving or resulting from such merger
      or consolidation;

    - shares of stock of any other corporation that at the effective date of the
      merger or consolidation will be either listed on a national securities
      exchange, or designated as a national market system security on an
      inter-dealer quotation system by the National Association of Securities
      Dealers, Inc. or held of record by more than 2,000 stockholders;

    - cash in lieu of fractional shares of the corporations described in the two
      immediately preceding bullet points; or

    - any combination of shares of stock and cash in lieu of fractional shares
      described in the three immediately preceding bullet points.

AMENDMENTS TO CERTIFICATE OR ARTICLES OF INCORPORATION

    Under the Washington Business Corporation Act, unless the articles of
incorporation require a greater vote, a proposed amendment of the articles of
incorporation generally requires approval of, in the case of a corporation with
a class of securities registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission
under section 12 or 15 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, a majority of all
shares entitled to vote on the amendment. The board of directors has limited
authority to make ministerial amendments to the articles of incorporation. Under
certain circumstances, holders of non-voting shares may be required to approve
an amendment to the articles of incorporation if such amendment would: increase
or decrease the aggregate number of shares of that class, exchange the shares in
that class for shares of another class, exchange shares of another class into
shares of the subject class, change the rights, designation or limitations of
the rights of some or all of the shares in the subject class, create a new class
that has distribution or dissolution rights equal to or superior than the
subject class, eliminate preemptive rights of the class, or affect rights to
receive dividends or other distributions.

    Under the Delaware General Corporation Law, unless the certificate of
incorporation requires a greater vote, a proposed amendment to the certificate
of incorporation requires an affirmative vote of a majority of the voting power
of the outstanding stock entitled to vote thereon and a majority of the voting
power of the outstanding stock of each class entitled to vote thereon. The
approval of the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of any class of
capital stock of a corporation, voting separately as a class, is required under
the Delaware General Corporation Law to approve a proposed amendment to a
corporation's certificate of incorporation, whether or not entitled to vote on
such amendment by the certificate of incorporation, if the amendment would
increase or decrease the aggregate number of authorized shares of such class
(except as provided in the last sentence of this paragraph), increase or
decrease the par value of the shares of such class, or alter or change the
powers, preferences or special rights of the shares of such class so as to
affect them adversely. For this purpose, if a proposed amendment would alter or
change the powers, preferences or special rights of one or more series of any
class so as to affect them adversely, but would not so affect the entire class,

then only the shares of the series so affected by the amendment would be
entitled to vote as a separate class on the amendment. Accordingly, a proposed
amendment the adverse effect of which on the powers, preferences or special
rights of any series of common stock does not differ from its adverse effect on
the powers, preferences or special rights of any other series of common stock
would not entitle such series to vote as a class separately from the other
series of common stock. The authorized number of shares of any class of stock
may be increased or decreased (but not below the number of shares of such class
outstanding) by the requisite vote described above if so provided in the
original certificate of incorporation or in any amendment thereto that created
such class of stock or that was adopted prior to the issuance of any shares of
such class, or in an amendment authorized by a majority vote of the holders of
shares of such class.

AMENDMENT TO BYLAWS

    The Washington Business Corporation Act provides that the shareholders and
the board of directors of a corporation have the authority to amend or repeal
bylaws. The ARIS bylaws provide that the ARIS Board may amend, repeal or adopt
new bylaws for the corporation. However, any such bylaws may be subsequently
changed or repealed by a majority of stock entitled to vote at any shareholders
meeting. Further, the bylaws may be amended or repealed by a majority vote of
the shareholders at any regular or special meeting of shareholders.

    Under the Delaware General Corporation Law, the power to adopt, alter and
repeal bylaws is vested in the stockholders, except to the extent that a
corporation's certificate of incorporation vests concurrent power in the board
of directors.

    Under the CIBER charter and CIBER bylaws, the CIBER board may amend the
CIBER bylaws or enact such other bylaws as in its judgment may be advisable for
the regulation at the conduct of the affairs of CIBER by the affirmative vote of
at least a majority of those present at any meeting at which a quorum is
present. CIBER stockholders may amend the CIBER bylaws by a majority vote of the
shares represented and entitled to vote at the meeting of the stockholders.

NO PREEMPTIVE RIGHTS

    The Washington Business Corporation Act provides that a shareholder will
have preemptive rights unless the articles of incorporation provide otherwise.
The articles of incorporation of ARIS provide that no shareholder shall have
preemptive rights.

    Under the Delaware General Corporation Law, a stockholder does not possess
preemptive rights unless such rights are specifically granted in the certificate
of incorporation. The CIBER charter does not provide for preemptive rights to
stockholders to subscribe for any additional shares of capital stock or other
obligations convertible into or exercisable for shares of capital stock that may
be issued by CIBER.

REDEMPTION OF CAPITAL STOCK

    The Washington Business Corporation Act provides that, subject to certain
limitations, a corporation's capital stock may be redeemable at the option of
the corporation, at the option of the shareholder, at the option of another
person or upon the occurrence of certain designated events.

    Under the Delaware General Corporation Law, subject to certain limitations,
a corporation's capital stock may be made subject to redemption by the
corporation at its option, at the option of holders of such stock or otherwise.

DIVIDEND SOURCES

    The Washington Business Corporation Act provides that a board of directors
may make distributions to shareholders only to the extent that such distribution
does not leave the corporation unable to pay its debts, and does not reduce the
value of the corporation's assets below the value of its liabilities. In
considering the value of liabilities, the board is required to include any
preferential rights of securities senior to those receiving such distribution.
If the proposed distribution would violate either of the tests enumerated above,
the corporation may not legally make it.

    Under the Delaware General Corporation Law, a board of directors may
authorize a corporation to make dividends and other distributions to its
stockholders, subject to any restrictions contained in the corporation's
certificate of incorporation, either out of surplus (defined as net assets less
statutory capital), or, if there is no surplus, out of net profits for the
fiscal year in which the dividend is declared and/or the preceding fiscal year.
Under the Delaware General Corporation Law, no distribution out of net profits
is permitted, however, if a corporation's capital is less than the amount of
capital represented by the issued and outstanding stock of all classes having a
preference upon the distribution of assets, until such deficiency has been
repaired.

DURATION OF PROXIES

    Under the Washington Business Corporation Act, a proxy is valid for eleven
months after receipt of the appointment form, unless the form provides
otherwise. The proxy is revocable unless it states that it is irrevocable and is
coupled with an interest sufficient in law to support an irrevocable power. The
interest may be either in the shares themselves or as provided in certain
agreements between the corporation and others that support a corporate purpose.

    Under the Delaware General Corporation Law, no proxy is valid for more than
three years after its date unless otherwise provided in the proxy. A proxy shall
be irrevocable if it states that it is irrevocable and if, and only as long as,
it is coupled with an interest sufficient in law to support an irrevocable
power. A proxy may be made irrevocable regardless of whether the interest with
which it is coupled is an interest in the stock itself or an interest in the
corporation generally.

SHAREHOLDER/STOCKHOLDER ACTION

    Under the Washington Business Corporation Act, if the articles of
incorporation so provide, any action required or permitted to be taken at a
meeting of shareholders may be taken without a meeting, without prior notice and
without a vote, if a written consent or consents setting forth the action taken
is signed by the holders of outstanding stock having not less than the minimum
number of votes that would be necessary to authorize or take such action at a
meeting at which all shares entitled to vote upon such action were present and
voted. The ARIS articles of incorporation do not contain such a provision.

    Under the Delaware General Corporation Law unless otherwise provided in the
certificate of incorporation, any action required or permitted to be taken at a
meeting of stockholders may be taken without a meeting, without prior notice and
without a vote, if a written consent or consents setting forth the action taken
is signed by the holders of outstanding stock having not less than the minimum
number of votes that would be necessary to authorize or take such action at a
meeting at which all shares entitled to vote upon such action were present and
voted. The CIBER charter provides that any action taken by written consent of
the stockholders shall be signed by stockholders holding not less than
two-thirds of the voting power of the outstanding stock entitled to vote.

SHAREHOLDER/STOCKHOLDER PROPOSALS

    Under the Washington Business Corporation Act, and under the ARIS bylaws,
there are no restrictions as to business that may be properly brought before an
annual meeting by a shareholder. However, the shareholder would have to satisfy
the requirements that a shareholder must meet to have a shareholder proposal
included in ARIS's proxy statement under SEC Rule 14a-8.

    The CIBER bylaws require that, for business to be properly brought before an
annual meeting by a stockholder, the stockholder must have given timely notice
in writing to the secretary of CIBER. To be timely, a stockholder's notice must
be delivered to or mailed and received at the principal executive office of
CIBER not less than 90 days prior to the anniversary date of the immediately
preceding annual meeting. A stockholder's notice to the secretary shall set
forth certain information specified in the CIBER bylaws. This requirement is
separate and apart from and in addition to the requirements that a stockholder
must meet to have a stockholder proposal included in CIBER proxy statement under
SEC Rule 14a-8.

MEETINGS OF SHAREHOLDERS/STOCKHOLDERS

    Under the Washington Business Corporation Act, a special meeting of the
shareholders may be called by the board or directors, or by persons authorized
by the articles of incorporation. In addition, the shareholders may call for a
special meeting of the shareholders. The ARIS bylaws provide that the President,
the board of directors, or 10% of the holders of shares entitled to vote at a
proposed meeting, may call a special meeting of shareholders.

    The Delaware General Corporation Law provides that a special meeting of
stockholders may be called by the board of directors or by such person or
persons as may be authorized by the certificate of incorporation or by the
bylaws. The CIBER charter and CIBER bylaws provide that special meetings of
CIBER stockholders may be called only by the chairman of the CIBER board, the
chief executive officer, the president, the executive vice president or the
board of directors pursuant to a resolution approved by a majority of the entire
board of directors. The entire board of directors is defined by the CIBER bylaws
as the total number of directors that CIBER would have if there were no
vacancies on the board.

CUMULATIVE VOTING

    The Washington Business Corporation Act provides that unless the certificate
of incorporation provides otherwise, each shareholder is entitles to cumulate
their votes in an election of directors. The ARIS articles of incorporation
provide that there shall be no cumulative voting.

    Under the Delaware General Corporation Law, the certificate of incorporation
may provide that at all elections of directors, or at elections held under
specified circumstances, each stockholder is entitled to cumulate such
stockholder's votes. The CIBER charter does not provide for cumulative voting
for the election of directors.

NUMBER AND ELECTION OF DIRECTORS

    The Washington Business Corporation Act provides that the either the
articles of incorporation or the bylaws may provide for the number of directors
and their respective terms as well as the manner in which the size of the board
will be determined. The articles of incorporation may provide that the directors
be divided into two or three classes, with the directors serving terms of two or
three years respectively. If the corporation's shares are divided into classes
or series, the articles of incorporation may provide that one or more of the
classes have the right to elect a specified number of directors. This right may
be allocated disproportionately.

    The ARIS articles of incorporation provide that the directors will be
divided into three classes, with each director serving a term of three years
from the date of election. The ARIS bylaws provide that the board shall consist
of seven person or such number that as may be designated by the then existing
board of directors. In addition, the number of directors may be increased or
decreased by resolution of either the directors or shareholders at any annual,
special or regular meeting, provided that no decrease in the number of directors
shall have the effect of shortening the term of any incumbent director.

    The Delaware General Corporation Law permits the certificate of
incorporation or the bylaws of a corporation to contain provisions governing the
number and terms of directors. However, if the certificate of incorporation
contains provisions fixing the number of directors, such number may not be
changed without amending the certificate of incorporation. The Delaware General
Corporation Law permits the certificate of incorporation of a corporation or a
bylaw adopted by the stockholders to provide that directors be divided into one,
two or three classes, with the term of office of one class of directors to
expire each year. The Delaware General Corporation Law also permits the
certificate of incorporation to confer upon holders of any class or series of
stock the right to elect one or more directors to serve for such terms and have
such voting powers as are stated in the certificate of incorporation. The terms
of office and voting powers of directors so elected may be greater or less than
those of any other director or class of directors.

    The CIBER bylaws provide that the number of directors will be as determined
by the CIBER board, but may not be fewer than three directors nor more than
eleven directors. The CIBER board is divided into three classes, with members
serving staggered three-year terms. The CIBER board currently consists of six
directors.

REMOVAL OF DIRECTORS

    Under the Washington Business Corporation Act, shareholders are generally
free to remove directors with or without cause. However, in the case of a
corporation having cumulative voting, if less than the entire board of directors
is to be removed, no director may be removed without cause if the votes cast
against such director's removal would be sufficient to elect such director if
then cumulatively voted at an election of the entire board of directors or of
the class of directors of which such director is a part.

    The ARIS bylaws provide that directors can be removed only at a special
meeting of shareholders called expressly to consider the removal of the director
or directors. At such special meeting, the director or directors will be removed
if two-thirds of the shares then present vote for removal.

    The Delaware General Corporation Law provides that a director or directors
may be removed with or without cause by the holders of a majority in voting
power of the shares then entitled to vote at an election of directors, except
that (1) members of a classified board of directors may be removed only for
cause, unless the certificate of incorporation provides otherwise, and (2) in
the case of a corporation having cumulative voting, if less than the entire
board of directors is to be removed, no director may be removed without cause if
the votes cast against such director's removal would be sufficient to elect such
director if then cumulatively voted at an election of the entire board of
directors or of the class of directors of which such director is a part.

VACANCIES

    The Washington Business Corporation Act provides that unless specified in
the articles of incorporation, either the directors or the shareholders may fill
any vacancy in the board of directors. The remaining directors are authorized to
fill the vacancy, even if the remaining number of directors would be
insufficient to constitute a quorum. However, if a quorum exists, then the
quorum must be present to fill the vacancy. A majority vote of the remaining
directors is required to fill the vacancy. If

a corporation has allocated the right to select certain directors to a class or
classes of stock, then the shareholders of that class or classes must fill the
vacant board seat.

    The ARIS articles of incorporation and bylaws specify that any vacant board
seat may be filled by an affirmative vote of the remaining directors. Such new
director shall serve until the next shareholder's meeting where directors are
elected and his or her successor is elected.

    Under the Delaware General Corporation Law unless otherwise provided in the
certificate of incorporation or the bylaws, vacancies on a board of directors
and newly created directorships resulting from an increase in the authorized
number of directors may be filled by a majority of the directors then in office,
although less than a quorum, or by the sole remaining director, provided that,
in the case of a classified board of directors, such vacancies and newly created
directorships may be filled by a majority of the directors elected by such class
or by the sole remaining director so elected. In the case of a classified board
of directors, directors elected to fill vacancies or newly created directorships
shall hold office until the next election of the class for which such directors
have been chosen, and until their successors have been duly elected and
qualified. In addition, if, at the time of the filling of any such vacancy or
newly created directorship, the directors in office constitute less than a
majority of the whole board of directors (as constituted immediately prior to
any such increase), the Delaware Court of Chancery may, upon application of any
stockholder or stockholders holding at least 10% of the total number of
outstanding shares entitled to vote for such directors, summarily order an
election to fill any such vacancy or newly created directorship, or replace the
directors chosen by the directors then in office.

    The CIBER charter and the CIBER bylaws provide that any vacancies on the
CIBER Board resulting from death, resignation, disqualification, removal or
other cause and newly created directorships resulting from any increase in the
number of directors shall be filled by the affirmative vote of a majority of the
remaining directors then in office, even though less than a quorum, or the sole
remaining director, or, if not so filled, by the stockholders at the next annual
meeting thereof or at a special meeting. The CIBER charter and CIBER bylaws also
provide that any directors elected to fill a vacancy on the CIBER Board or a
newly created directorship will serve for the remainder of the full term of the
class of directors for which such director was elected and until such director's
successor shall have been elected and qualified.

INDEMNIFICATION OF DIRECTORS AND OFFICERS

    The Washington Business Corporation Act generally permits a corporation to
indemnify its directors and officers against expenses, judgments, fines and
amounts paid in settlement actually and reasonably incurred in connection with a
third-party action, other than a derivative action or in connection with any
proceeding against a director charging improper personal benefit, and against
expenses actually and reasonably incurred in the defense or settlement of a
derivative action, provided that there is a determination that the individual
acted in good faith and in a manner reasonably believed to be in or not opposed
to the best interests of the corporation, or in the case of a criminal
proceeding, the director had no reasonable cause to believe that their conduct
was unlawful. Such determination shall be made, in the case of an individual who
is a director or officer at the time of such determination by any of the
following methods:

    - by a majority of the directors not a party to the action if a quorum of
      such directors exist;

    - If a quorum of such directors does not exist, by a committee of directors
      not a party to the action designated by a majority vote of such directors;

    - by special legal counsel, selected either by the board or committee as
      specified above, or by a majority of the board, where all directors, even
      those who are parties to the action are allowed to vote; or

    - by the shareholders, however shares owned or under control of directors
      that are parties to the action may not vote their shares.

    No indemnification may be made in respect of any derivative action in which
such individual is adjudged liable to the corporation, or in an action where an
individual has is adjudged liable to the corporation for receipt of an improper
personal benefit. However, such individual may request a court to order payment
of reasonable expenses only if such person is entitled to such indemnification
under all of the relevant circumstances.

    The Washington Business Corporations Act requires indemnification of
directors and officers for expenses relating to a wholly successful defense on
the merits or otherwise of a derivative or third-party action.

    The Washington Business Corporation Act allows a corporation to advance
expenses relating to the defense of any proceeding to directors and officers
contingent upon such individuals' commitment to repay any advances unless it is
determined ultimately that such individuals are entitled to be indemnified, and
upon delivery of a written affirmation of their good faith belief that they have
meet the standard of conduct required of directors.

    The ARIS bylaws provide that ARIS officers and directors shall be
indemnified to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law.

    The Delaware General Corporation Law generally permits a corporation to
indemnify its directors and officers against expenses, judgments, fines and
amounts paid in settlement actually and reasonably incurred in connection with a
third-party action, other than a derivative action, and against expenses
actually and reasonably incurred in the defense or settlement of a derivative
action, provided that there is a determination that the individual acted in good
faith and in a manner reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best
interests of the corporation. Such determination shall be made, in the case of
an individual who is a director or officer at the time of such determination:

    - by a majority of the disinterested directors, even though less than a
      quorum;

    - by a committee of such directors designated by a majority vote of such
      directors, even though less than a quorum;

    - by independent legal counsel, regardless of whether a quorum of
      disinterested directors exists; or

    - by a majority vote of the stockholders, at a meeting at which a quorum is
      present.

    Without court approval, however, no indemnification may be made in respect
of any derivative action in which such individual is adjudged liable to the
corporation.

    The Delaware General Corporation Law requires indemnification of directors
and officers for expenses relating to a successful defense on the merits or
otherwise of a derivative or third-party action.

    The Delaware General Corporation Law permits a corporation to advance
expenses relating to the defense of any proceeding to directors and officers
contingent upon such individuals' commitment to repay any advances unless it is
determined ultimately that such individuals are entitled to be indemnified.

    Under the Delaware General Corporation Law, the rights to indemnification
and advancement of expenses provided in the law are non-exclusive, in that,
subject to public policy issues, indemnification and advancement of expenses
beyond that provided by statute may be provided by bylaw, agreement, vote of
stockholders, disinterested directors or otherwise.

    The CIBER certificate of incorporation and bylaws provides that CIBER
officers and directors shall be indemnified to the fullest extent permitted by
the laws of the State of Delaware.

LIMITATION OF PERSONAL LIABILITY OF DIRECTORS

    Under the Washington Business Corporation Act, a director is not personally
liable, for either action or inaction, as long as that director performed their
duties in good faith, with the care an ordinary prudent person would exercise
under the circumstances, and in a manner which the director reasonably believed
was in the best interests of the corporation.

    The Washington Business Corporation Act provides that a corporations
articles of incorporation may contain a provision which limits or eliminates the
director's personal liability provided that such provision shall not limit the
liability of a director for actions or inactions that involve intentional
misconduct, or a knowing violation of the law, or for any transaction where such
director receives money, property, or services that the director is not legally
entitled.

    The ARIS articles of incorporation provide that limits the personal
liability of directors to the extent allows as described in the preceding`
paragraph. Further, the provision provides that if the Washington Business
Corporation Act is amended allowing further limitations on the personal
liability of directors, then the corporation shall limit the liability of
directors to the extent allowed under the Washington Business Corporation Act,
as amended.

    The Delaware General Corporation Law provides that a corporation's
certificate of incorporation may include a provision limiting the personal
liability of a director to the corporation or its stockholders for monetary
damages for breach of fiduciary duty as a director. However, no such provision
can eliminate or limit the liability of a director for:

    - any breach of the director's duty of loyalty to the corporation or its
      stockholders;

    - acts or omissions not in good faith or that involve intentional misconduct
      or a knowing violation of the law;

    - violation of certain provisions of the Delaware General Corporation Law;

    - any transaction from which the director derived an improper personal
      benefit; or

    - any act or omission prior to the adoption of such a provision in the
      certificate of incorporation.

    The CIBER charter provides that, to the fullest extent permitted by the
Delaware General Corporation Law, a director of CIBER shall not be liable to
CIBER or any of its stockholders for monetary damages for breach of fiduciary
duty as a director.

    acquire shares of ARIS Common Stock and shall be converted automatically
    into warrants to acquire shares of CIBER Common Stock as provided below, and
    CIBER shall assume each ARIS Warrant subject to the terms of the agreements
    evidencing grants thereunder. From and after the Effective Time, (i) the

    Exchange Ratio (subject to adjustment as provided in this Agreement),
    rounded down to the nearest whole share of CIBER Common Stock, and (ii) the
    exercise price per share of CIBER Common Stock under each ARIS Warrant shall
    be obtained by dividing (x) the exercise price per share of ARIS Common
    Stock of each ARIS Warrant immediately prior to the Effective Time by
    (y) the Warrant Exchange Ratio (subject to adjustment as provided in this
    Agreement), and rounding up or down to the nearest cent. The Board of
    Directors of ARIS (or a duly empowered committee thereof) has adopted all
    resolutions and otherwise taken all action necessary to effectuate the
    foregoing.

        (h) No fractional share of CIBER Common Stock will be issued by virtue
    of the Merger but, in lieu thereof, CIBER shall pay to the Exchange Agent an
    amount of cash sufficient for the Exchange Agent to pay each former holder
    of shares of ARIS Common Stock who would otherwise be entitled to a fraction
    of a share of CIBER Common Stock (after aggregating all fractional shares of
    CIBER Common Stock to be received by such holder) an amount of cash (rounded
    to the nearest whole cent) equal to the product obtained by multiplying
    (x) such fraction of a share of CIBER Common Stock by (y) the dollar value
    of the Merger Consideration per share.

    Section 2.6  CLOSING OF THE COMPANY'S TRANSFER BOOKS.  At the Effective
Time: the stock transfer books of ARIS shall be closed with respect to all
shares of ARIS Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time.
No further transfer of any such shares of ARIS Common Stock shall be made on
such stock transfer books after the Effective Time. If, after the Effective
Time, a valid ARIS Stock Certificate is presented to the Exchange Agent or to
CIBER, such ARIS Stock Certificate shall be canceled and shall be exchanged as
provided in Section 2.7

    Section 2.7  EXCHANGE OF CERTIFICATES.

    (a) On or prior to the Closing Date, CIBER shall select a reputable bank or
trust company to act as exchange agent in the Merger (the "Exchange Agent").
Promptly after the Effective Time, CIBER shall deposit with the Exchange Agent
(i) certificates representing the shares of CIBER Common Stock issuable pursuant
to this Article II, and (ii) cash sufficient to pay the Cash Consideration and
to make payments in lieu of fractional shares in accordance with Section 2.5.
The shares of CIBER Common Stock and cash amounts so deposited with the Exchange
Agent, together with any dividends or distributions received by the Exchange
Agent with respect to such shares, are referred to collectively as the "Exchange
Fund."

    (b) As soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time, the Exchange
Agent will mail to the record holders of ARIS Stock Certificates (i) a letter of
transmittal in customary form and containing such provisions as CIBER may
reasonably specify (including a provision confirming that delivery of ARIS Stock
Certificates shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to ARIS Stock
Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of such ARIS Stock Certificates to
the Exchange Agent), and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of
ARIS Stock Certificates in exchange for certificates representing CIBER Common
Stock. Upon surrender of a ARIS Stock Certificate to the Exchange Agent for
exchange, together with a duly executed letter of transmittal and such other
documents as may be reasonably required by the Exchange Agent or CIBER, (1) the
holder of such ARIS Stock Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange
therefor a certificate representing the number of whole shares of CIBER Common
Stock and the Cash Consideration that such holder has

                                      A-13

the right to receive pursuant to the provisions of Section 2.5 (together with
cash in lieu of any fractional share of CIBER Common Stock), and (2) the ARIS
Stock Certificate so surrendered shall be canceled. Until surrendered as
contemplated by this Section 2.7, each ARIS Stock Certificate shall be deemed,
from and after the Effective Time, to represent only the right to receive shares
of CIBER Common Stock, the Cash Consideration (together with cash in lieu of any
fractional share of CIBER Common Stock) as contemplated by Section 2.5. If any
ARIS Stock Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, CIBER may, in
its discretion and as a condition precedent to the issuance of any certificate
representing CIBER Common Stock, require the owner of such lost, stolen or
destroyed ARIS Stock Certificate to provide an appropriate affidavit and to
deliver a bond (in such sum as CIBER may reasonably direct) as indemnity against
any claim that may be made against the Exchange Agent or CIBER with respect to
such ARIS Stock Certificate.

    (c) No dividends or other distributions declared or made with respect to
CIBER Common Stock with a record date after the Effective Time shall be paid to
the holder of any unsurrendered ARIS Stock Certificate with respect to the
shares of CIBER Common Stock that such holder has the right to receive in the
Merger until such holder surrenders such ARIS Stock Certificate in accordance
with this Section 2.7 (at which time such holder shall be entitled, subject to
the effect of applicable escheat or similar laws, to receive all such dividends
and distributions, without interest).

    (d) Any portion of the Exchange Fund that remains undistributed to holders
of ARIS Stock Certificates as of the date 180 days after the date on which the
Merger becomes effective shall be delivered to CIBER upon demand, and any
holders of ARIS Stock Certificates who have not theretofore surrendered their
ARIS Stock Certificates in accordance with this Section 2.7 shall thereafter
look only to CIBER for satisfaction of their claims for CIBER Common Stock, cash
in lieu of fractional shares of CIBER Common Stock and any dividends or
distributions with respect to CIBER Common Stock.

    (e) Each of the Exchange Agent and CIBER shall be entitled to deduct and
withhold from any consideration payable or otherwise deliverable pursuant to
this Agreement to any holder or former holder of ARIS Common Stock such amounts
as may be required to be deducted or withheld therefrom under the Code or any
provision of state, local or foreign tax law or under any other applicable Legal
Requirement. To the extent such amounts are so deducted or withheld, such
amounts shall be treated for all purposes under this Agreement as having been
paid to the Person to whom such amounts would otherwise have been paid.

    (f) Neither CIBER nor the Surviving Corporation shall be liable to any
holder or former holder of ARIS Common Stock or to any other Person with respect
to any shares of CIBER Common Stock (or dividends or distributions with respect
thereto), or for any cash amounts, delivered to any public official pursuant to
any applicable abandoned property law, escheat law or similar Legal Requirement.

    Section 2.8  ADJUSTMENT OF STOCK CONSIDERATION.  If subsequent to the date
of this Agreement but prior to the Closing Date, the outstanding shares of CIBER
Common Stock or the ARIS Common Stock, respectively, shall have been changed
into a different number of shares or a different class as a result of a stock
split, reverse stock split, stock dividend, subdivision, reclassification,
combination, exchange, recapitalization or other similar transaction, the Stock
Consideration shall be appropriately adjusted.

    Section 2.9  ARIS FINAL CLOSING BALANCE SHEET.  ARIS shall deliver to CIBER
three (3) business days prior to the Closing Date a consolidated balance sheet
of ARIS and its Subsidiaries prepared in accordance with GAAP consistently with
ARIS's standard month-end closing procedure and reviewed by independent auditors
acceptable to CIBER in accordance with its standard quarter-end review
procedures (the "ARIS Final Closing Balance Sheet"). The ARIS Final Closing
Balance Sheet shall fairly present the financial position of ARIS and its
Subsidiaries as of the ending date of the month immediately preceding the
Closing Date if the Closing Date is on or after the 15th day of the month, or as
of the ending date of the second month preceding the Closing Date if the Closing
Date is prior to the 15th day of the month (such date being the "Final Closing
Balance Sheet Date") in accordance with GAAP.

                                      A-14

    Section 2.10  CIBER BALANCE SHEETS.  CIBER shall deliver to ARIS (i) ten
(10) business days after the date of this Agreement Date a consolidated balance
sheet of CIBER and its Subsidiaries prepared in accordance with GAAP
consistently with CIBER's standard month-end closing procedure for the period
ended May 31, 2001, and (ii) three (3) business days prior to the Closing Date a
consolidated balance sheet of CIBER and its Subsidiaries prepared in accordance
with GAAP consistently with CIBER's standard month-end closing procedure (the
"CIBER Final Closing Balance Sheet"). The CIBER Final Closing Balance Sheet
shall fairly present the financial position of CIBER and its Subsidiaries as of
the Final Closing Balance Sheet Date in accordance with GAAP.

    Section 2.11  FURTHER ACTION.  If, at any time after the Effective Time, any
further action is determined by CIBER to be necessary or desirable to carry out
the purposes of this Agreement or to vest CIBER with full right, title and
possession of and to all rights and property of ARIS, the officers and directors
of CIBER shall be fully authorized (in the name of CIBER, in the name of ARIS
and otherwise) to take such action.

                                  ARTICLE III
                     REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF ARIS

the same section number heading in the ARIS Disclosure Schedules, ARIS hereby
represents and warrants to CIBER as follows:

    Section 3.1  ORGANIZATION.  ARIS is a corporation duly incorporated, validly
existing and in good standing under the laws of the State of Washington and has
the corporate power to own its property and to carry on its business as now
being conducted. ARIS and its Subsidiaries are duly qualified and/or licensed,
as may be required, and in good standing in each of the jurisdictions in which
the nature of the business conducted by them or the character of the property
owned, leased or used by them makes such qualification and/or licensing
necessary, except where the failure to be so qualified and/or licensed would not
have a ARIS Material Adverse Effect. ARIS has delivered to CIBER complete and
correct copies of its articles of incorporation and bylaws, as amended to the
date of this Agreement and the articles of incorporation and bylaws, or other
applicable organizational documents, of each of ARIS's Subsidiaries. Attached
hereto as SCHEDULE 3.1 is a complete list of those states in which ARIS is
required to be qualified and/or licensed to do business and an indication of
whether ARIS is so qualified and/or licensed and in good standing in such
states.

    Section 3.2  CAPITAL STOCK OF ARIS.

    (a) At the date hereof:

        (i) ARIS's authorized capital stock consists of 5,000,000 shares of
    preferred stock, no par value per share, none of which are outstanding, and
    100,000,000 shares of ARIS Common Stock, no par value per share, of which
    11,321,116 are issued and outstanding (the "ARIS Stock"); and

        (ii) Except as set forth in Section 3.2(a) or on SCHEDULE 3.2(A), there
    are not outstanding as of the date hereof (A) shares of stock or other
    voting securities of ARIS, (B) securities of ARIS convertible into or
    exchangeable for shares of stock or voting securities of ARIS or (C) any
    options, warrants or other rights to acquire from ARIS, or other obligation
    of ARIS to issue, any stock, voting securities or securities convertible
    into or exchangeable for stock or voting securities of ARIS.

    (b) All outstanding shares of ARIS Stock have been and, at or prior to the
Effective Time, will be duly authorized and validly issued, fully paid and
non-assessable.

                                      A-15

    Section 3.3  AUTHORITY RELATIVE TO THIS AGREEMENT; NON-CONTRAVENTION.

    (a) ARIS has the requisite corporate power and authority to enter into this
Agreement and to carry out its obligations hereunder. The execution and delivery
of this Agreement by ARIS, the performance by ARIS of its obligations hereunder
and the consummation by ARIS of the transactions contemplated herein have been
duly authorized by the board of directors of ARIS, and no other corporate
proceedings on the part of ARIS other than the approval of the Shareholders are
necessary to authorize the execution and delivery of this Agreement, the

This Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by ARIS and constitutes a
valid and binding obligation of ARIS, enforceable against ARIS in accordance
with its terms.

    (b) Except as set forth in SCHEDULE 3.3, neither the execution and delivery
of this Agreement by ARIS nor the consummation by ARIS of the transactions
contemplated herein nor compliance by ARIS with any of the provisions hereof
will (i) conflict with or result in any breach of the articles of incorporation
or by-laws of ARIS, (ii) result in a violation or breach of any provisions of,
or constitute a default (or an event which, with notice or lapse of time or
both, would constitute a default) under, or result in the termination of, or
accelerate the performance required by, or result in a right of termination or
acceleration under, or result in the creation of any Lien upon any of the assets
or properties of ARIS under, or result in the loss of a material benefit under,
any of the terms, conditions or provisions of any note, bond, mortgage,
indenture, deed of trust, license, contract, lease, agreement or other

the Secretary of State of the State of Washington, the filing of the Certificate
of Merger and Plan of Merger with the Secretary of State of the State of

and any foreign antitrust law or regulation, no action by ARIS or any
governmental authority is necessary for ARIS's execution and delivery of this
Agreement or the consummation by ARIS of the transactions contemplated hereby,
except where the failure to obtain or take such action would not reasonably be
expected (i) to prevent the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby
or (ii) to have a ARIS Material Adverse Effect.

    (d) No consents, approvals, orders, registrations, declarations, filings or
authorizations are required on the part of ARIS for or in connection with the
execution and delivery of this Agreement or the performance by ARIS of the
transactions contemplated on its part hereby, except for any action contemplated
by subsection (c) above or where the failure to obtain or take such action would
not reasonably be expected (i) to prevent the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby or (ii) to have an ARIS Material Adverse Effect.

    Section 3.4  SEC REPORTS AND FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.  Since January 1, 1998,
ARIS has filed with the SEC all ARIS SEC Reports required to be filed by ARIS
with the SEC. As of their respective dates, the ARIS SEC Reports complied in all
material respects with the applicable requirements of the Securities Act, the
Exchange Act and the respective rules and regulations promulgated thereunder
applicable to such ARIS SEC Reports and, except to the extent that information
contained in any ARIS SEC Report has been revised or superseded by a later ARIS
SEC Report filed and publicly

                                      A-16

available prior to the date of this Agreement (a "Filed SEC Document"), none of
the ARIS SEC Reports contained any untrue statement of a material fact or
omitted to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in
order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which
they were made, not misleading. The financial statements of ARIS included in the
ARIS SEC Reports that are publicly available prior to the date of this
Agreement, were prepared in accordance with GAAP (except, in the case of
unaudited statements, as permitted by the SEC) applied on a consistent basis
during the periods involved (except as may be indicated in the notes thereto)
and presented fairly the consolidated financial position of ARIS and its
consolidated Subsidiaries as of the dates thereof and the consolidated results
of their operations and cash flows for the periods then ended (subject, in the
case of unaudited statements, to normal year-end audit adjustments). Except as
set forth in the ARIS SEC Reports, neither ARIS nor any of the ARIS Subsidiaries
has any liabilities or obligations of any nature (whether accrued, absolute,
contingent or otherwise) required by GAAP to be set forth on a consolidated
balance sheet of ARIS and its consolidated Subsidiaries or in the notes thereto
and which, individually or in the aggregate, would reasonably be expected to
have a ARIS Material Adverse Effect. None of the ARIS Subsidiaries is required
to file any forms, reports or other documents with the SEC pursuant to Sections
12 or 15 of the Exchange Act.

    Section 3.5  ABSENCE OF CERTAIN CHANGES.  Except as set forth in
SCHEDULE 3.5, (i) since March 31, 2001, ARIS has conducted its business only in
the ordinary course and there has not been any change by ARIS in accounting
principles or methods except insofar as may be required by GAAP, and (ii) since
March 31, 2001, there has not been (A) any granting by ARIS to any officer or
director of ARIS of any increase in compensation, except in the ordinary course
of business consistent with prior practice, (B) any granting by ARIS to any such
officer of any increase in severance or termination pay, (C) any entry by ARIS
into any employment, severance or termination with any such officer, (D) any
right or option granted by ARIS to any employee or the acceleration of the
vesting or exercise of any such right or option, or (E) any purchase,
redemption, or other acquisition of shares of ARIS's capital stock or any
interest therein.

    Section 3.6  LITIGATION.  Except as set forth in SCHEDULE 3.6, there is no
suit, action or legal, administrative, arbitration or other proceeding or
governmental investigation pending or, to the knowledge of ARIS, threatened, to
which ARIS or any of its Subsidiaries is, or would be, a party or by which it is
or would be affected which, considered individually or in the aggregate, if
determined adversely to ARIS or any of its Subsidiaries, is reasonably likely
(i) to have a ARIS Material Adverse Effect, (ii) to impair the ability of ARIS
to perform its or their obligations under this Agreement or (iii) to prevent the
consummation of any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, nor is
there any judgment, decree, injunction, rule or order of any Governmental Entity
or arbitrator outstanding against it having, or which, insofar as reasonably can
be foreseen, in the future would have, any such effect.

    Section 3.7  BROKERS/FINANCIAL ADVISORS.  Except for Friedman, Billings,
Ramsey & Co., Inc. ("FBR"), no broker, finder or investment banker is entitled
to any brokerage, finder's or other fee or commission in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement based upon arrangements made by or
on behalf of ARIS. Prior to the date of this Agreement, ARIS has provided to
CIBER a complete and correct copy of all agreements between ARIS and FBR
pursuant to which such firm will be entitled to any payment relating to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

    Section 3.8  SUBSIDIARIES.  Except as set forth in SCHEDULE 3.8, ARIS has no
Subsidiaries.

    Section 3.9  BOARD RECOMMENDATION; ARIS ACTION; REQUISITE VOTE OF ARIS'S
STOCKHOLDERS.

    (a) The board of directors of ARIS has by resolutions duly adopted by the
unanimous vote of its entire board of directors at a meeting of such board duly
called and held on June 11, 2001, determined that the Merger is fair to and in
the best interests of ARIS and its Shareholders, approved and

                                      A-17

declared advisable this Agreement, the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated hereby and recommended that the Shareholders of ARIS approve and
adopt this Agreement and the Merger. In connection with such approval, ARIS's
board of directors shall have received from FBR an opinion to the effect that
the consideration to be paid to the shareholders of ARIS in the Merger is fair
to the shareholders of ARIS from a financial point of view subject to the
assumptions and qualifications in such opinion. A copy of such opinion has been
delivered to CIBER and such opinion has not been withdrawn or modified in any
material respect. ARIS has been authorized by FBR to include such opinion in its
entirety in the Proxy Statement, so long as such inclusion is in form and
substance reasonably satisfactory to FBR and its counsel.

    (b) The affirmative vote of two-thirds of the shareholders of ARIS is
required for approval and adoption of this Agreement and the Merger (the
"Required ARIS Shareholder Vote"), and no other vote of any holder of ARIS's
securities is required for the approval and adoption of this Agreement or the
Merger.

    Section 3.10  ABSENCE OF CHANGES IN BENEFIT PLANS.  Except as set forth in
SCHEDULE 3.10, since December 31, 2000, there has not been any adoption or
amendment by ARIS of any Benefit Plan. Except as set forth in the financial
statements described in Section 3.4 hereof and for those agreements set forth on
SCHEDULE 3.10, and except for obligations existing as a matter of law, there
exists no employment, consulting, severance, termination or indemnification
agreements, arrangements or understandings between ARIS and any current or
former employee, officer or director of ARIS who earns (or earned prior to
termination) annual cash compensation in excess of $100,000. No Benefit Plan
provides benefits to any person who is not a current employee, officer or
director of ARIS.

    Section 3.11  COMPLIANCE WITH LAWS.  Neither ARIS nor any of its
Subsidiaries has violated or failed to comply with any statute, law, ordinance,
regulation, rule, judgment, decree or order of any Governmental Entity
applicable to its business or operations, except for violations and failures to
comply that are not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably expected to
result in a ARIS Material Adverse Effect or otherwise adversely impact the
business of ARIS. Except as set forth in SCHEDULE 3.11, ARIS and its
Subsidiaries have not received any written communication during the past two
fiscal years from a Governmental Entity that alleges that it is not in
compliance with any applicable law. Except for expenditures to maintain routine
business licenses and Taxes not yet due and payable, neither ARIS or any of its
Subsidiaries is required to make, and neither ARIS nor any of its Subsidiaries
has a reasonable expectation that it will be required to make, any expenditures
to achieve or maintain compliance with applicable law. ARIS and its Subsidiaries
are in material compliance with all immigration and other laws relating to the
employment or retention of persons who are not citizens of the United States. No
investigation or review by any Governmental Entity with respect to the business
of ARIS or any of its Subsidiaries is pending or threatened.

    Section 3.12  ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS.

    (a) ARIS and its Subsidiaries have not (x) placed or disposed of any
Hazardous Substances on, under, from or at any of ARIS's or any of its
Subsidiary's properties or any other properties presently or formerly owned or
operated by ARIS or any of its Subsidiaries (the "Properties"), in violation of
any applicable Environmental Laws, except for violations that would not, in all
such cases, taken individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to
result in a ARIS Material Adverse Effect, (y) any knowledge of the presence of
any Hazardous Substances on, under or at any of the Properties or any other
property but arising from the Properties, in violation of any applicable
Environmental Laws, except for violations that would not, in all such cases
taken individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to result in a
ARIS Material Adverse Effect or otherwise materially adversely impact the
business of ARIS, or (z) received any written notice (A) during the preceding
five fiscal years from a Governmental Entity that ARIS or any of its
Subsidiaries are in violation of, or has failed to obtain any necessary permit
or authorization under, any Environmental Laws, (B) of the institution

                                      A-18

or pendency of any suit, action, claim, proceeding or investigation by any
Governmental Entity or any third party in connection with any such violation or
in connection with a release or threatened release of hazardous substances at
the Properties or any other properties for which ARIS or any of its Subsidiaries
may be responsible, (C) requiring the response to or remediation of a release or
threatened release of Hazardous Substances at or arising from any of the
Properties or any other properties or (D) demanding payment by ARIS or any of
its Subsidiaries for response to or remediation of a release or threatened
release of Hazardous Substances at or arising from any of the Properties or any
other properties.

    (b) No Environmental Law imposes any obligation upon ARIS or any of its
Subsidiaries arising out of or as a condition to any transaction contemplated by
this Agreement, including, without limitation, any requirement to modify or to
transfer any permit or license, any requirement to file any notice or other
submission with any Governmental Entity, the placement of any notice,
acknowledgment or covenant in any land records, or the modification of or
provision of notice under any agreement, consent order or consent decree. No
Lien has been placed upon any of ARIS's or any of its Subsidiaries, owned or
leased properties under any Environmental Law.

    Section 3.13  CONTRACTS; DEBT INSTRUMENTS.  Except as set forth in
Schedule 3.13, neither ARIS nor or any of its Subsidiaries is a party to or
bound by:

        (a) any employment or consulting agreement, contract or commitment with
    any executive officer or higher level employee or member of ARIS's board of
    directors, other than those that are terminable by ARIS or any of its
    Subsidiaries on no more than thirty (30) days' notice without liability or
    financial obligation to ARIS;

        (b) any agreement or plan, including, without limitation, any stock
    option plan, stock appreciation right plan or stock purchase plan, any of
    the benefits of which will be increased, or the vesting of benefits of which
    will be accelerated, by the occurrence of any of the transactions
    contemplated by this Agreement or the value of any of the benefits of which
    will be calculated on the basis of any of the transactions contemplated by
    this Agreement;

        (c) any material agreement of indemnification or any guaranty other than
    any agreement of indemnification entered into in the ordinary course of
    business;

        (d) any agreement, contract or commitment containing any covenant
    limiting in any material respect the right of ARIS or any of its
    Subsidiaries to engage in any line of business or to compete with any Person
    or granting any exclusive distribution rights;

        (e) any agreement, contract or commitment that directly or indirectly
    prevents ARIS or any of its Subsidiaries from providing services to or
    performing work for competitors of any customer of ARIS or any of its
    Subsidiaries or any other similar restriction imposed on ARIS or any of its
    Subsidiaries by a customer;

        (f) any agreement, contract or commitment currently in force relating to
    the disposition or acquisition by ARIS or any of its Subsidiaries after the
    date of this Agreement of a material amount of assets not in the ordinary
    course of business or pursuant to which ARIS or any of its Subsidiaries has
    any material ownership interest in any corporation, partnership, joint
    venture or other business enterprise other than ARIS's Subsidiaries;

        (g) any customer, dealer, distributor, marketing or development
    agreement currently in force under which ARIS or any of its Subsidiaries has
    continuing material obligations to provide any product, technology or
    service and that may not be canceled without penalty upon notice of ninety
    (90) days or less, or any material agreement entered into outside the
    ordinary course pursuant to which ARIS or any of its Subsidiaries have
    continuing material obligations to develop any

                                      A-19

    Intellectual Property that may not be canceled without penalty upon notice
    of ninety (90) days or less;

        (h) any agreement, contract or commitment currently in force and entered
    into outside the ordinary course of business to provide source code to any
    third party for any product or technology that is material to ARIS or any of
    its Subsidiaries;

        (i) any mortgages, indentures, guarantees, loans or credit agreements,
    security agreements or other agreements or instruments relating to the
    borrowing of money or extension of credit in excess of $100,000
    individually;

        (j) any material settlement agreement entered into within two (2) years
    prior to the date of this Agreement; or

        (k) any agreement entered into in the ordinary course of business
    providing for annualized revenue to ARIS or any of its Subsidiaries of more
    than $500,000.

        (l) any written or oral contract for hire which obligates ARIS or any of
    its Subsidiaries to work on a fixed-fee basis regardless of the number of
    hours actually spent on the project by the ARIS or Subsidiary employees (a
    "Fixed-Fee Contract"), and, to the best of ARIS's knowledge, no Fixed-Fee
    Contract would reasonably be expected as of the Effective Time to cost ARIS
    or any of its Subsidiaries more in expenses and wages payable to its
    employees than fees and revenues generated by the Fixed-Fee Contract except
    where the cost of completing such Fixed Fee Contracts, individually or in
    the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to result in a ARIS Material
    Adverse Effect.

    ARIS and its Subsidiaries are not, nor to ARIS's knowledge is any other
party to a Contract, in breach, violation or default under, and neither ARIS nor
any of its Subsidiaries have received written notice that it has breached,
violated or defaulted under, any of the material terms or conditions of any
contract that is required to be disclosed above SCHEDULE 3.13 in such a manner

would permit any other party to seek material damages or other remedies (for any
or all of such breaches, violations or defaults, in the aggregate).

    Section 3.14  PROPERTIES.

    (a) ARIS and its Subsidiaries have good title to, or valid leasehold
interests in, all of their properties and assets, except for such as are no

assets and properties in which ARIS or any of its Subsidiaries have leasehold
interests, are free and clear of all Liens other than the Permitted Liens. The
tangible personal property used by ARIS or any of its Subsidiaries that has net

condition thereof, as could not reasonably be expected to result in a ARIS
Material Adverse Effect.

    (b) ARIS and its Subsidiaries have complied with the terms of all leases to
which any of them is a party and under which any of them is in occupancy, and
all such leases are in full force and effect. Except as set forth on

possession under all such leases. ARIS and its Subsidiaries own no real property
other than the Real Property.

transaction approved by CIBER, which approval shall not be unreasonably
withheld, (i) ARIS shall have good and marketable

                                      A-20

title to the Real Property as of the Closing Date, and (ii) shall deliver to
CIBER, (A) within 30 days of signing this Agreement, a Title Report, together

45 days of signing this Agreement, a Survey, both of which shall express such
results as shall be reasonably satisfactory to CIBER.

property rights and computer programs, software and data owned or used by or
registered in the name of ARIS or any of its Subsidiaries or in which ARIS or
any of its Subsidiaries have any rights, licenses, or immunities (collectively,
the "Intellectual Property"). ARIS has furnished CIBER with copies of all
license agreements, with the exception of "shrink wrap" licenses, to which ARIS
or any of its Subsidiaries are a party, either as licensor or licensee, with

other rights in or relating to the Intellectual Property.

slowdowns or lockouts.

material respects, except for those forms and descriptions that would not
reasonably be expected to have a ARIS Material Adverse Effect.

    (b) Each Benefit Plan has been administered in all material respects in
accordance with its terms and in compliance in all material respects with the
applicable provisions of ERISA and the Code. There are no investigations by any
governmental agency, termination proceedings or other claims (except claims for

properly accrued and reflected in financial statements of ARIS referred to in

ARIS Pension Plan is qualified and exempt from federal income taxes under
Sections 401(a) and 501(a), respectively, of the Code; no such determination
letter has been revoked and revocation has not been threatened; no circumstances
exist that would adversely affect the tax-qualification of such ARIS Pension
Plan; and such ARIS Pension Plan has not been amended since the effective date
of its most recent determination letter in any respect that could be reasonably
expected to materially adversely affect its qualification, materially increase
its cost or require security under Section 307 of ERISA. ARIS has delivered to
CIBER a copy of the most recent determination letter received with respect to
each ARIS Pension Plan for which such a letter has been issued; a copy of any
pending application for a determination letter and a list of all ARIS Pension
Plan amendments as to which a favorable determination letter has not yet been
received.

    (f) No "prohibited transaction" (as defined in Section 4975 of the Code or
Section 406 of ERISA) has occurred that involves the assets of any Benefit Plan;

employees or a trustee, administrator or other fiduciary of any trust created

imposed by Section 4975 of the Code or Title I of ERISA; and neither ARIS nor
any trustee, administrator or other fiduciary of any Benefit Plan nor any agent

Section 4980B(f) of the Code with respect to each Benefit Plan that is a group
health plan, as such term is defined in Section 5000(b)(1) of the Code.

    (h) No compensation payable by ARIS to any of its employees, officers or

Subsidiaries or any of its affiliates who is a "disqualified individual" (as
such term is defined in proposed Treasury Regulation Section 1.280G-1) under any
employment, severance or termination agreement, other compensation arrangement
or Benefit Plan currently in effect would not be characterized as an "excess

each such executive officer calculated as of the date of this Agreement.

affiliates, officers or directors should be discovered by ARIS which should be
set forth in an amendment to the Form S-4 or a supplement to the Proxy
Statement/ Prospectus, ARIS shall promptly inform CIBER. Notwithstanding the

    Section 7.1  TERMINATION.  This Agreement may be terminated at any time
prior to the Effective Time whether before or after approval of this Agreement
and the transactions contemplated herein by the respective boards of directors
or shareholders of the parties hereto:

        (a) by mutual written consent of CIBER and ARIS;

        (b) by either of CIBER or ARIS if the Closing Date shall not have
    occurred within 150 days from the date of this Agreement; PROVIDED, HOWEVER,
    that the right to terminate this Agreement under this Section 7.1(b) shall
    not be available to any party whose breach of any obligation under this
    Agreement has been the cause of, or resulted in, the failure of the Closing
    Date to occur on or before such date;

        (c) by ARIS if CIBER shall have failed to perform in any material
    respect any of its representation, warranties, covenants or other agreements
    contained in this agreement;

    restraining, enjoining or otherwise prohibiting the transactions
    contemplated by this Agreement, and such order, decree, ruling or other
    action shall have become final and nonappealable;

        (f) by ARIS or CIBER if (i) the ARIS Shareholders' Meeting (including
    any adjournments and postponements thereof) shall have been held and
    completed and ARIS's shareholders shall have voted on a proposal to adopt
    this Agreement, and (ii) this Agreement shall not have been adopted at such
    meeting (and shall not have been adopted at any adjournment or postponement
    thereof) by the Required ARIS Shareholder Vote; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that a
    party shall not be permitted to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this
    Section 7.1(f) if the failure to obtain such

                                      A-36

    shareholder approval is attributable to a failure on the part of such party
    to perform any material obligation required to be performed by such party at
    or prior to the Effective Time;

        (g) by CIBER if ARIS shall have breached Section 5.7(a);

        (k) by CIBER if prior to the ARIS Shareholders' meeting, ARIS receives
    an Acquisition Proposal that it determines is a Superior Proposal in
    accordance with Section 5.3(c) and resolves to accept such Superior Proposal
    or the Board of Directors of ARIS (or a committee thereof) shall have
    withdrawn, modified or amended in any manner adverse to CIBER its approval
    or recommendation in favor of the Merger, or shall have recommended or
    approved an Acquisition Proposal or shall have resolved to do any of the
    foregoing.

    Section 7.2  EFFECT OF TERMINATION.  Upon the termination of this Agreement
pursuant to Section 7.1, this Agreement shall forthwith become null and void,
PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that (i) this Section 7.2, Sections 7.3 and 5.4 and
Article VIII shall survive the termination of this Agreement and shall remain in
full force and effect, and (ii) the termination of this Agreement shall not
relieve any party from any liability for any material inaccuracy in or breach of
any representation or any material breach of any warranty, covenant or other
provision contained in this Agreement.

    Section 7.3  EXPENSES; TERMINATION FEE.  Except as set forth in this
Section 7.3, all fees and expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement
and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be paid by the party
incurring such expenses, whether or not the Merger is consummated; PROVIDED,
HOWEVER, that:

        (a) In the event that this Agreement is terminated by CIBER pursuant to
    Sections 7.1 (g) or (k), then ARIS shall pay to CIBER a termination fee of
    $1,500,000;

        (b) In the event this Agreement is terminated by ARIS pursuant to
    Section 7.1(i), then CIBER shall pay to ARIS a termination fee of
    $1,500,000;

        (c) If all of the conditions of Sections 6.1 and 6.3 shall have been
    satisfied and CIBER determines not to consummate all of the transactions
    contemplated by this Agreement, the parties agree that such action would
    cause actual injury to ARIS, the nature of which would be difficult to
    ascertain, and therefore CIBER would pay to ARIS liquidated damages in the
    amount of $2,500,000 as the sole and exclusive remedy of ARIS with respect
    to such action and otherwise with respect to this Agreement.

    If ARIS or CIBER fails to pay within three (3) business days any amount
payable under this Section 7.3, then (i) the obligor party shall reimburse
obligee party for all costs and expenses (including fees and disbursements of
counsel) incurred in connection with the collection of such overdue amount and
the enforcement by the obligee party of its rights under this Section 7.3, and
(ii) the obligor party shall pay to obligee party interest on such overdue
amount (for the period commencing as of the date such overdue amount was
originally required to be paid and ending on the date such overdue amount is
actually paid) at a rate per annum equal to 2% over the "prime rate" (as
reported by the Wall Street Journal) in effect on the date such overdue amount
was originally required to be paid.

                OPINION OF FRIEDMAN BILLINGS & RAMSEY CO., INC.

                                                                   June 11, 2001

Board of Directors
Aris Corporation
2229 12th Avenue, NE
Bellevue, WA 98004-2936

Board of Directors:

    You have requested our opinion as to the fairness, from a financial point of
view, to the shareholders (the "Shareholders") of Aris Corporation ("Aris" or
the "Company") of the consideration to be paid to the Shareholders by
Ciber, Inc. ("Ciber") in connection with the proposed acquisition (the
"Transaction") of all of the outstanding securities of the Company. The
Transaction will be made pursuant and subject to the Agreement and Plan of
Merger (the "Agreement") by and among the Company, Ciber and Arsenal Acquisition
Corporation, a wholly-owned direct subsidiary of Ciber. The consideration
offered by Ciber in the Transaction for each issued and outstanding share of
Company common stock, no par value ("Company Common Stock") will be (i) .220
shares of Ciber, par value $.01 (the "Ciber Common Stock") and (ii) $1.30 in
cash, subject to adjustment as provided in the Merger Agreement (the
"Consideration"). For purposes of this opinion, we have assumed, with your
consent, that for the Shareholders, the Transaction will qualify as a tax-free
reorganization under the United States Internal Revenue Code and that the
Transaction will be accounted for as a purchase.

    Friedman, Billings Ramsey & Co., Inc. ("FBR") has been engaged by the
    Company to review the Transaction and to deliver to the board of directors
    of the Company an opinion regarding the fairness to the Shareholders, from a
    financial point of view, of the Consideration to be paid by Ciber in the
    Transaction. In connection with our review of the Transaction, and in
    arriving at our opinion, we have among other things:

    1.  Reviewed the Merger Agreement and the financial terms and conditions set
       forth therein, as well as the schedules thereto;

    2.  Reviewed the audited balance sheets of Ciber and Aris as of
       December 31, 2000, 1999 and 1998, respectively, and the audited results
       of operations and statements of cash flow for the years ended
       December 31, 2000, 1999 and 1998, respectively, accompanied in each case
       by the audit report thereon of Pricewaterhousecoopers LLP in the case of
       Aris, and KPMG LLP in the case of Ciber, and the unaudited balance sheets
       of Ciber and Aris as of March 31, 2001 and the related results of
       operations and statement of cash flows for the three-month period then
       ended;

    3.  Reviewed other data relating to Ciber and Aris, including: certain
       internal financial statements and other financial and operating data,
       including certain financial forecasts and other forward-looking financial
       information, concerning Ciber and Aris, prepared by the management teams
       of the respective companies;

    4.  Reviewed certain publicly available research estimates by research
       analysts regarding Aris and Ciber, respectively;

    5.  Reviewed the reported stock price and trading activity for Aris Common
       Stock and Ciber Common Stock;

    6.  Compared the financial performance and securities data of Aris and Ciber
       with that of certain other companies we deem comparable to Aris and Ciber
       whose securities are traded in public markets, which securities like many
       information technology services and Internet-related stocks

                                      B-1

       have been and are likely to continue to be subject to significant
       short-term price and trading volatility;

    7.  Compared the financial terms of the Transaction with the financial
       terms, to the extent publicly available, of other transactions that we
       deemed relevant;

    8.  Participated in discussions and negotiations among representatives of
       Aris and Ciber and their advisors during the three weeks preceding the
       date hereof; and

    9.  Made such other studies and inquiries, and reviewed such other data, as
       we deemed relevant.

    In preparing our opinion, we have assumed and relied on the accuracy and
completeness of all information supplied or otherwise made available to us by
the Company and Ciber or any other third party and have not independently
verified any such information. We have not made an independent evaluation or
appraisal of the assets or liabilities of either the Company or Ciber, and we
have not been furnished with any such evaluation or appraisal.

    With respect to the financial projections provided to us by the Company and
Ciber, we have assumed that such projections were prepared in good faith on
reasonable bases reflecting management's' current best estimates and judgments
of the Company's and Ciber's future financial performance as independent
companies and as a combined company. This opinion is based substantially upon
the financial projections and estimates described above. Further, without
limiting the foregoing, we have assumed, without independent verification, that
the historical and projected financial information provided to us by the Company
and Ciber, respectively, accurately reflects the historical and projected
operations of the Company and Ciber.

    We have made no independent investigation of any legal matters involving the
Company or Ciber, and we have assumed the correctness of all legal advice given
to you and us by counsel.

    Our opinion is based on market, economic, financial and other circumstances
and conditions as they exist and can be evaluated as of the date of this letter,
and any material change in such circumstances and conditions would require a
reevaluation of this opinion, which we are under no obligation to undertake.

    We express no opinion as to the underlying business decision of the Company
to effect the Transaction, the structure, or accounting treatment or taxation
consequences of the Agreement or the availability or the advisability of any
alternatives to the Transaction. FBR did not structure the Transaction or
negotiate the terms of the Transaction. Further, we express no opinion as to the
value of the Ciber Common Stock upon the consummation of the Transaction or the
price at which the Ciber Common Stock will trade at any time. Our opinion is
limited to the fairness, from a financial point of view, of the Consideration to
the Shareholders. We express no opinion with respect to any other reasons,
legal, business, or otherwise, that may support the decision of the board of
directors to approve or consummate the Transaction.

    We have been engaged by the Company in connection with the Transaction, and,
for our rendering of this opinion, the Company will pay us a fee. In addition,
the Company has agreed to indemnify us against certain liabilities arising out
of our engagement including the rendering of this opinion and other matters.

    It is understood that this letter is for the information of the Company's
board of directors in evaluating the Transaction. This opinion may not be used
by the Company for any other purpose or reproduced, disseminated, quoted or
referred to by the Company at any time, in any manner or for any purpose, in
whole or in part, without our prior written consent, which shall not be
unreasonably withheld, except that this opinion may be reproduced in full in,
and references to the opinion and to FBR and its relationship with the Company
(in each case in such form as FBR may approve) may be included in any proxy
statement or prospectus relating to the Transaction that the Company or Ciber

                                      B-2

files with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission and distributes
to Shareholders in connection with the Transaction. This letter should not be
construed as creating any fiduciary duty on the part of FBR to any party.

    FBR, as part of its investment banking services, is regularly engaged in the
    valuation of businesses and securities in connection with mergers,
    acquisitions, underwritings, sales and distributions of listed and unlisted
    securities, private placements and valuations for corporate and other
    purposes. In the ordinary course of business, we may trade in the Company's
    securities for our own account and the accounts of our customers, and,
    accordingly, may at any time hold a long or short position in the Company's
    securities.

    Based on and subject to the foregoing, we are of the opinion that, as of the
date hereof, the Consideration to be paid by Ciber in the Transaction is fair,
from a financial point of view, to the Shareholders.

Very truly yours,
FRIEDMAN, BILLINGS, RAMSEY & CO., INC.

    (3) "Fair value," with respect to a dissenter's shares, means the value of

corporation on its principal bank loans or, if none, at a rate that is fair and
equitable under all the circumstances.

                                      C-1

RCW 23B.13.020. RIGHT TO DISSENT.

    (1) A shareholder is entitled to dissent from, and obtain payment of the
fair value of the shareholder's shares in the event of, any of the following
corporate actions:

        (a) Consummation of a plan of merger to which the corporation is a party
    (i) if shareholder approval is required for the merger by RCW 23B.11.030,
    23B.11.080, or the articles of incorporation and the shareholder is entitled
    to vote on the merger, or (ii) if the corporation is a subsidiary that is
    merged with its parent under RCW 23B.11.040;

        (b) Consummation of a plan of share exchange to which the corporation is
    a party as the corporation whose shares will be acquired, if the shareholder
    is entitled to vote on the plan;

        (c) Consummation of a sale or exchange of all, or substantially all, of
    the property of the corporation other than in the usual and regular course
    of business, if the shareholder is entitled to vote on the sale or exchange,
    including a sale in dissolution, but not including a sale pursuant to court
    order or a sale for cash pursuant to a plan by which all or substantially
    all of the net proceeds of the sale will be distributed to the shareholders
    within one year after the date of sale;

        (d) An amendment of the articles of incorporation that materially
    reduces the number of shares owned by the shareholder to a fraction of a
    share if the fractional share so created is to be acquired for cash under
    RCW 23B.06.040; or

        (e) Any corporate action taken pursuant to a shareholder vote to the
    extent the articles of incorporation, bylaws, or a resolution of the board
    of directors provides that voting or nonvoting shareholders are entitled to
    dissent and obtain payment for their shares.

    (2) A shareholder entitled to dissent and obtain payment for the
shareholder's shares under this chapter may not challenge the corporate action
creating the shareholder's entitlement unless the action fails to comply with
the procedural requirements imposed by this title, RCW 25.10.900 through
25.10.955, the articles of incorporation, or the bylaws, or is fraudulent with
respect to the shareholder or the corporation.

    (3) The right of a dissenting shareholder to obtain payment of the fair
value of the shareholder's shares shall terminate upon the occurrence of any one
of the following events:

        (a) The proposed corporate action is abandoned or rescinded;

        (b) A court having jurisdiction permanently enjoins or sets aside the
    corporate action; or

        (c) The shareholder's demand for payment is withdrawn with the written
    consent of the corporation. [1991 c 269 s 37; 1989 c 165 s 141.]

RCW 23B.13.030. DISSENT BY NOMINEES AND BENEFICIAL OWNERS.

    (1) A record shareholder may assert dissenters' rights as to fewer than all
the shares registered in the shareholder's name only if the shareholder dissents
with respect to all shares beneficially owned by any one person and notifies the
corporation in writing of the name and address of each person on whose behalf
the shareholder asserts dissenters' rights. The rights of a partial dissenter
under this subsection are determined as if the shares as to which the dissenter
dissents and the dissenter's other shares were registered in the names of
different shareholders.

    (2) A beneficial shareholder may assert dissenters' rights as to shares held
on the beneficial shareholder's behalf only if:

        (a) The beneficial shareholder submits to the corporation the record
    shareholder's written consent to the dissent not later than the time the
    beneficial shareholder asserts dissenters' rights; and

                                      C-2

        (b) The beneficial shareholder does so with respect to all shares of
    which such shareholder is the beneficial shareholder or over which such
    shareholder has power to direct the vote. [1989 c 165 s 142.]

RCW 23B.13.200. NOTICE OF DISSENTERS' RIGHTS.

notice must state that shareholders are or may be entitled to assert dissenters'
rights under this chapter and be accompanied by a copy of this chapter.

    (2) If corporate action creating dissenters' rights under RCW 23B.13.020 is
taken without a vote of shareholders, the corporation, within ten days after
[the] effective date of such corporate action, shall notify in writing all
shareholders entitled to assert dissenters' rights that the action was taken and
send them the dissenters' notice described in RCW 23B.13.220. [1989 c 165 s
143.]

    certificates for certificated shares must be deposited;

        (b) Inform holders of uncertificated shares to what extent transfer of
    the shares will be restricted after the payment demand is received;

        (c) Supply a form for demanding payment that includes the date of the
    first announcement to news media or to shareholders of the terms of the
    proposed corporate action and requires that the person asserting dissenters'
    rights certify whether or not the person acquired beneficial ownership of
    the shares before that date;

        (d) Set a date by which the corporation must receive the payment demand,
    which date may not be fewer than thirty nor more than sixty days after the
    date the notice in subsection (1) of this section is delivered; and

RCW 23B.13.230. DUTY TO DEMAND PAYMENT.

    (1) A shareholder sent a dissenters' notice described in RCW 23B.13.220 must

shareholder until the proposed corporate action is effected.

    (3) A shareholder who does not demand payment or deposit the shareholder's
share certificates where required, each by the date set in the dissenters'

chapter. [1989 c 165 s 146.]

RCW 23B.13.240 SHARE RESTRICTIONS.

    (1) The corporation may restrict the transfer of uncertificated shares from

    (2) The person for whom dissenters' rights are asserted as to uncertificated
shares retains all other rights of a shareholder until the effective date of the
proposed corporate action. [1989 c 165 s 147.]

shareholder's shares, plus accrued interest.

        (a) The corporation's balance sheet as of the end of a fiscal year

    (1) If the corporation does not effect the proposed action within sixty days

restrictions imposed on uncertificated shares.

    (2) If after returning deposited certificates and releasing transfer
restrictions, the corporation wishes to undertake the proposed action, it must
send a new dissenters' notice under RCW 23B.13.220 and repeat the payment demand
procedure. [1989 c 165 s 149.]

RCW 23B.13.270. AFTER-ACQUIRED SHARES.

    (1) A corporation may elect to withhold payment required by RCW 23B.13.250

before the date set forth in the dissenters'

                                      C-4

notice as the date of the first announcement to news media or to shareholders of
the terms of the proposed corporate action.

    (2) To the extent the corporation elects to withhold payment under
subsection (1) of this section, after taking the proposed corporate action, it
shall estimate the fair value of the shares, plus accrued interest, and shall
pay this amount to each dissenter who agrees to accept it in full satisfaction
of the dissenter's demand. The corporation shall send with its offer an
explanation of how it estimated the fair value of the shares, an explanation of
how the interest was calculated, and a statement of the dissenter's right to
demand payment under RCW 23B.13.280. [1989 c 165 s 150.]

RCW 23B.13.280. PROCEDURE IF SHAREHOLDER DISSATISFIED WITH PAYMENT OR OFFER.

    (1) A dissenter may notify the corporation in writing of the dissenter's own
estimate of the fair value of the dissenter's shares and amount of interest due,
and demand payment of the dissenter's estimate, less any payment under
RCW 23B.13.250, or reject the corporation's offer under RCW 23B.13.270 and
demand payment of the dissenter's estimate of the fair value of the dissenter's
shares and interest due, if:

        (a) The dissenter believes that the amount paid under RCW 23B.13.250 or
    offered under RCW 23B.13.270 is less than the fair value of the dissenter's
    shares or that the interest due is incorrectly calculated;

        (b) The corporation fails to make payment under RCW 23B.13.250 within
    sixty days after the date set for demanding payment; or

        (c) The corporation does not effect the proposed action and does not
    return the deposited certificates or release the transfer restrictions
    imposed on uncertificated shares within sixty days after the date set for
    demanding payment.

    (2) A dissenter waives the right to demand payment under this section unless
the dissenter notifies the corporation of the dissenter's demand in writing
under subsection (1) of this section within thirty days after the corporation
made or offered payment for the dissenter's shares. [1989 c 165 s 151.]

RCW 23B.13.300. COURT ACTION.

    (1) If a demand for payment under RCW 23B.13.280 remains unsettled, the
corporation shall commence a proceeding within sixty days after receiving the
payment demand and petition the court to determine the fair value of the shares
and accrued interest. If the corporation does not commence the proceeding within
the sixty-day period, it shall pay each dissenter whose demand remains unsettled
the amount demanded.

    (2) The corporation shall commence the proceeding in the superior court of
the county where a corporation's principal office, or, if none in this state,
its registered office, is located. If the corporation is a foreign corporation
without a registered office in this state, it shall commence the proceeding in
the county in this state where the registered office of the domestic corporation
merged with or whose shares were acquired by the foreign corporation was
located.

    (3) The corporation shall make all dissenters, whether or not residents of
this state, whose demands remain unsettled, parties to the proceeding as in an
action against their shares and all parties must be served with a copy of the
petition. Nonresidents may be served by registered or certified mail or by
publication as provided by law.

    (4) The corporation may join as a party to the proceeding any shareholder
who claims to be a dissenter but who has not, in the opinion of the corporation,
complied with the provisions of this chapter. If the court determines that such
shareholder has not complied with the provisions of this chapter, the
shareholder shall be dismissed as a party.

                                      C-5

    (5) The jurisdiction of the court in which the proceeding is commenced under
subsection (2) of this section is plenary and exclusive. The court may appoint
one or more persons as appraisers to receive evidence and recommend decision on
the question of fair value. The appraisers have the powers described in the
order appointing them, or in any amendment to it. The dissenters are entitled to
the same discovery rights as parties in other civil proceedings.

    (6) Each dissenter made a party to the proceeding is entitled to judgment
(a) for the amount, if any, by which the court finds the fair value of the
dissenter's shares, plus interest, exceeds the amount paid by the corporation,
or (b) for the fair value, plus accrued interest, of the dissenter's
after-acquired shares for which the corporation elected to withhold payment
under RCW 23B.13.270. [1989 c 165 s 152.]

RCW 23B.13.310. COURT COSTS AND COUNSEL FEES.

    (1) The court in a proceeding commenced under RCW 23B.13.300 shall determine
all costs of the proceeding, including the reasonable compensation and expenses
of appraisers appointed by the court. The court shall assess the costs against
the corporation, except that the court may assess the costs against all or some
of the dissenters, in amounts the court finds equitable, to the extent the court
finds the dissenters acted arbitrarily, vexatiously, or not in good faith in
demanding payment under RCW 23B.13.280.

    (2) The court may also assess the fees and expenses of counsel and experts
for the respective parties, in amounts the court finds equitable:

        (a) Against the corporation and in favor of any or all dissenters if the
    court finds the corporation did not substantially comply with the
    requirements of RCW 23B.13.200 through 23B.13.280; or

        (b) Against either the corporation or a dissenter, in favor of any other
    party, if the court finds that the party against whom the fees and expenses
    are assessed acted arbitrarily, vexatiously, or not in good faith with
    respect to the rights provided by chapter 23B.13 RCW.

    (3) If the court finds that the services of counsel for any dissenter were
of substantial benefit to other dissenters similarly situated, and that the fees
for those services should not be assessed against the corporation, the court may
award to these counsel reasonable fees to be paid out of the amounts awarded the
dissenters who were benefited. [1989 c 165 s 153.]
