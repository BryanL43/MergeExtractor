Dear Stockholder:

information about the matters to be acted upon are enclosed. All holders of
record of Cambridge common stock as of the close of business on May 21, 2001
are entitled to notice of, and to vote at, the special meeting.

  On March 12, 2001, Cambridge's board of directors approved an Agreement and
Plan of Reorganization among Novell, Inc., Ceres Neptune Acquisition Corp., a
wholly owned subsidiary of Novell, and Cambridge Technology Partners
(Massachusetts), Inc. The Agreement and Plan of Reorganization was amended as

as amended (the "merger agreement"), provides for the merger of Ceres Neptune
into Cambridge, with Cambridge being the surviving corporation. Following the
merger, Cambridge will be a wholly owned subsidiary of Novell. In the merger,
each of your shares of Cambridge common stock will be exchanged for 0.668 of a
share of Novell common stock. Novell common stock is listed on the Nasdaq
National Market under the trading symbol "NOVL." On May 24, 2001, Novell common
stock closed at a price of $4.81 per share.

  After careful consideration, the Cambridge board of directors has determined
the merger to be in your best interests and has declared the merger advisable.
Cambridge's board of directors has approved the merger agreement and recommends
that you vote FOR the proposal to adopt the merger agreement and approve the
transactions contemplated thereby.

  The merger cannot be completed unless a majority of the outstanding Cambridge
common stock is voted in favor of adopting the merger agreement and approving
the merger. Each record holder of a share of Cambridge common stock will be
entitled to cast one vote.

  This proxy statement-prospectus provides you with detailed information
concerning Novell and the merger. Please give all of the information contained
in the proxy statement-prospectus your careful attention. In particular, you

                             QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS
                               ABOUT THE MERGER

Q: Why are Novell and Cambridge combining businesses?

A. The boards of directors of Novell and Cambridge have determined that a
   combined company has the potential to realize a stronger competitive
   position and to achieve improved long-term operating and financial results.
   In particular, we believe the merger will provide Novell and Cambridge the
   opportunity to:

   . offer a combination of web-based software products and services to better

Q: When and where is the special stockholders' meeting being held and what
   specific proposals will I be asked to consider?

A: The Cambridge special stockholders' meeting will take place on July 10,
   2001 at the offices of Cambridge. At the special meeting, Cambridge
   stockholders will be asked to adopt the merger agreement and approve the
   merger of Ceres Neptune Acquisition Corp., a wholly owned subsidiary of
   Novell, with and into Cambridge, resulting in Cambridge becoming a wholly
   owned subsidiary of Novell. Following the merger, Cambridge stockholders
   will become stockholders of Novell.

   The Cambridge board of directors recommends voting in favor of this
   proposal.

   In addition, Cambridge stockholders may be asked to vote on any other
   matters that properly come before the meeting.

Q: What will I receive in the merger?

A: If the merger is completed, you will receive 0.668 of a share of Novell
   common stock for each share of Cambridge common stock you own at the time
   of the merger. You will not receive any fractional shares of Novell common
   stock in the merger, but will receive cash equal to the market value of
   your fractional shares as determined under the merger agreement.

Q: When can I sell the shares of Novell stock that I receive in the merger?

A: The shares of Novell common stock received by you in the merger will be
   freely transferable unless you are an "affiliate" of either Novell or
   Cambridge. Generally, an "affiliate" is considered to be someone who is a
   senior executive officer or director of a company or someone who owns more
   than 10% of the outstanding stock of a company.

Q: How many shares of Novell common stock will Cambridge's stockholders own
   after the merger?

A: Based on the number of outstanding shares of Cambridge stock as of May 21,
   2001, after the merger stockholders of Cambridge will own approximately 43
   million shares of Novell common stock. This will constitute approximately
   12% of the outstanding Novell common stock after the merger.

Q: What do I need to do now?

A: After carefully reading and considering the information contained in this
   proxy statement-prospectus, please respond by completing, signing and
   dating your proxy card and returning it in the enclosed postage paid
   envelope. Alternatively, you may submit your proxy by telephone or by using
   the Internet. Please submit your proxy as soon as possible so that your
   shares may be represented at the special meeting.

Q: What happens if I don't indicate how to vote my proxy?

A: If you properly sign your proxy card but do not include instructions on how
   to vote, your shares will be voted FOR adoption of the merger agreement and
   approval of the merger.

Q: What happens if I don't return a proxy card?

A: Not returning your proxy card will have the same effect as voting against
   the merger. This is why it is so important that you make your vote count by
   completing and returning your proxy card.

Q: Can I change my vote after I have mailed my signed proxy card or voted over
   the Internet or the telephone?

A: Yes. You can change your vote at any time before your proxy is voted at the
   special meeting. You can do this in one of four ways:

   . you can send a written notice to the Secretary of Cambridge stating that
     you would like to revoke your proxy;

   . you can complete and submit a new proxy card;

   . you can vote by telephone or over the Internet (your latest vote is
     counted); or

   . you can attend the special meeting and vote in person.

  Your attendance at the meeting alone will not revoke your proxy. Only your
  vote at the meeting will revoke your proxy.

Q: If my broker holds my shares in "street name," will my broker vote my
   shares for me?

A: No. Your broker will not be able to vote your shares without instructions
   from you. If you do not provide your broker with voting instructions, your
   shares will be considered present at the special meeting for purposes of
   determining a quorum but will not be voted in favor of the merger. If you
   have instructed a broker to vote your shares, you must follow directions
   received from your broker to change those instructions.

Q: Should I send in my stock certificates now?

A: No. After the merger is completed, Novell's exchange agent will send you
   written instructions for exchanging your Cambridge stock certificates for
   Novell stock certificates.

Q: Will a Cambridge stockholder's rights as a Novell stockholder be different
   than a Cambridge stockholder's rights as a Cambridge stockholder?

A: Yes. At the time of the merger and upon the exchange of Cambridge common
   stock for Novell common stock, each Cambridge stockholder will become a
   Novell stockholder. There are differences between the rights of
   stockholders of Novell and stockholders of Cambridge. Please carefully
   review the description of these differences in the section entitled
   "Comparison of Rights of Holders of Cambridge Common Stock and Novell
   Common Stock" on page 70 of this proxy statement-prospectus.

Q: Am I entitled to appraisal rights?

A: No. Under Delaware law, you are not entitled to appraisal rights in the
   merger.

Q: How many shares of common stock must be represented either in person or by
   proxy to hold the meeting?

A: A majority of the outstanding shares of Cambridge common stock must be
   represented in person or by proxy to constitute a quorum at the special
   meeting.

Q: How many votes are needed to approve the merger?

A: A majority of the outstanding shares of Cambridge common stock must be
   voted in favor of the merger for it to be approved.

  You should be aware that Jack L. Messman, Cambridge's president and chief
  executive officer, as well as all other executive officers and directors of
  Cambridge, have agreed to vote their shares of Cambridge common stock in
  favor of the merger. These individuals held approximately 1.8% of
  Cambridge's outstanding common stock as of the record date.

Q: When do you expect the merger to be completed?

A: Novell and Cambridge expect to complete the merger immediately after the
   Cambridge special meeting on July 10, 2001.

Q: Who can help answer my questions?

Novell stockholders are not required to adopt the merger agreement or approve
the merger.

   You are entitled to cast one vote for each share of Cambridge common stock

Recommendation of Cambridge's Board of Directors

   After careful consideration, Cambridge's board of directors has determined
the merger to be in your best interests and recommends that you vote FOR the
adoption of the merger agreement and approval of the merger.

Opinion of Cambridge's Financial Advisor

   On March 9, 2001, Salomon Smith Barney Inc. delivered its oral opinion to
the board of directors of Cambridge that, as of the date of such opinion and
subject to certain considerations, the exchange ratio provided for in the
merger agreement was fair, from a financial point of view, to the holders of
Cambridge common stock. Salomon Smith Barney subsequently confirmed in writing
as of March 12, 2001, that, as of such date, the exchange ratio was fair from a
financial point of view to the holders of Cambridge common stock. The opinion
of Salomon Smith Barney does not constitute a recommendation as to how any
Cambridge stockholder should vote with respect to the merger.

   The full text of the written opinion of Salomon Smith Barney, which sets
forth assumptions made, matters considered and limitations on the review
undertaken in connection with the opinion, is attached to this proxy statement-
prospectus as Annex B. Stockholders of Cambridge are encouraged to, and should,
read the opinion in its entirety. You should carefully consider the discussion
of Salomon Smith Barney's analysis in the section entitled "Opinion of
Cambridge's financial advisor" on page 33 of this proxy statement-prospectus.

Completion and Effectiveness of the Merger

   Novell and Cambridge will complete the merger when all of the conditions to
completion of the merger, as described below, are either satisfied or waived.
The merger will become effective upon the filing of a certificate of merger
with the State of Delaware.

   Novell and Cambridge are working toward completing the merger as quickly as
possible and hope to complete the merger in the second calendar quarter of
2001.

Conditions to Completion of the Merger

   Completion of the merger is subject to the satisfaction or waiver of a
number of conditions, including:

  . holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of Cambridge common stock
    must vote in favor of adopting the merger agreement and approving the
    merger;

  . the registration statement, of which this proxy statement-prospectus is a
    part, must be declared and remain effective with the SEC;

  . no law, regulation or order preventing the completion of the merger shall
    be in effect;

  . the applicable waiting periods under antitrust laws must expire or be
    terminated;

  . the shares of Novell common stock to be issued in the merger must be
    approved for listing on the Nasdaq National Market;

    by Cambridge shall be appointed to fill the newly created vacancies; and

  . Jack L. Messman shall accept and not rescind his acceptance of the offer
    to serve as Novell's president and chief executive officer.

Termination of the Merger Agreement

   Cambridge and Novell may mutually agree to terminate the merger agreement
without completing the merger. Additionally, either Cambridge or Novell may
terminate the merger agreement under any of the following circumstances:

  . if the merger is not completed by September 30, 2001;

  . if a final court order prohibiting the merger is issued and is not
    appealable;

  . if the Cambridge stockholders do not adopt the merger agreement and
    approve the merger; or

  . if the conditions to complete the merger would not be satisfied because
    of a breach of a representation or warranty in the merger agreement
    resulting in a material adverse effect or a failure to comply in all
    material respects with a covenant or agreement in the merger agreement.

   Novell may terminate the merger agreement if:

  . Cambridge or its representatives breach their agreement not to solicit
    alternative proposals for a business combination with Cambridge;

  . Cambridge's board of directors withdraws or changes, in a manner adverse
    to Novell, its recommendation in favor of the merger;

  . Cambridge's board of directors does not reaffirm its recommendation in
    favor of the merger within ten business days after Novell requests
    reaffirmation as provided for in the merger agreement;

  . Cambridge's board of directors approves or recommends any acquisition
    proposal from a party other than Novell;

  . Cambridge enters into any letter of intent or other agreement accepting
    any acquisition proposal from a party other than Novell; or

  . a tender or exchange offer relating to the securities of Cambridge is
    commenced by a person unaffiliated with Novell, and Cambridge does not
    recommend that its stockholders reject such offer within ten business
    days after such offer is first made.

Payment of Termination Fee

   If the merger agreement terminates under certain circumstances, Cambridge is
required to pay Novell an aggregate termination fee of $7.3 million, plus any
expenses incurred to collect such fee.

Cambridge Board May Withdraw Its Recommendation in Favor of the Merger

   Nothing in the merger agreement prevents the Cambridge board of directors
from withdrawing or changing its recommendation in favor of the merger if the
board reasonably concludes in good faith, after consultation with its outside
counsel, that the failure to withdraw or change its recommendation would be
inconsistent with its fiduciary obligations.

Cambridge Prohibited from Soliciting Other Offers

   Cambridge has agreed, subject to limited exceptions, not to initiate or
engage in discussions with another party regarding a business combination while
the merger with Novell is pending.

Interests of Some Cambridge Directors and Officers in the Merger

   In considering the recommendations of the Cambridge board of directors, you
should be aware that some Cambridge directors and executive officers have
indemnification arrangements, employment agreements, stock options, grants of
restricted stock and other contingent rights that give them interests in the
merger which are different from yours. In addition, Jack L. Messman, a director
and the president and chief executive officer of Cambridge, is a director of
Novell. It is a condition to closing that Mr. Messman shall accept and not
withdraw his acceptance of the positions of president and chief executive
officer of Novell. Mr. Messman has entered into an employment agreement with
Novell which is described on pages 42-43 of this proxy statement-prospectus. It
is also a condition to the closing that two directors of Cambridge designated
by Cambridge, other than Mr. Messman, be appointed to the Novell board of
directors.

Share Ownership of Management

   As of the record date, Cambridge directors, executive officers and
affiliates beneficially owned approximately 25.7% of the outstanding shares of
Cambridge common stock. Mr. Messman, as well as other executive officers and
directors of Cambridge, have agreed to vote their Cambridge shares in favor of
the merger.

Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger

   In general, Cambridge stockholders will not recognize gain or loss for
United States federal income tax purposes as a result of the merger, except for
taxes payable because of cash received instead of fractional shares. It is a
condition to the merger that Novell and Cambridge receive legal opinions
stating that the merger will be a reorganization. You should carefully read the
discussion under "Material U.S. federal income tax consequences of the merger"
on page 47 of this proxy statement-prospectus. However, you are encouraged to
consult your own tax advisor because tax matters can be complicated, and the
tax consequences of the merger to you will depend upon your own situation.

Accounting Treatment of the Merger

   Novell intends to account for the merger as a "purchase" transaction.

Antitrust Approval Required to Complete the Merger

   The merger is subject to antitrust laws. Novell and Cambridge have made the
required filings with the United States Department of Justice and the Federal
Trade Commission under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of
1976, as amended, and the applicable waiting period has been terminated. In
addition, Novell and Cambridge have received the required antitrust clearance
under the applicable German antitrust laws, and have made competition filings
in Brazil and the Netherlands. The Department of Justice or the Federal Trade
Commission, as well as a state, private person or foreign regulatory agency or
government, may challenge the merger at any time before or after its
completion.

Restrictions on the Ability to Sell Novell Stock

   All shares of Novell common stock received by you in connection with the
merger will be freely transferable unless you are considered an "affiliate" of
either Novell or Cambridge at the time of the merger. Affiliates of Novell or
Cambridge are subject to certain securities laws that restrict their ability to
transfer the shares they receive in the merger.

   Generally, an affiliate is considered to be someone who is a senior
executive officer or director of a company or someone who owns more than 10% of
the outstanding stock of a company.

Post-Merger Divestitures

   Cambridge and Novell have formed an integration committee to oversee the
integration of the Cambridge and Novell businesses. Following the closing of
the merger, the combined company may determine, based on the integration
committee's analysis, that some of the combined company's businesses do not
strategically fit within the combined company's business plan and, as a result,
such businesses may be divested.

Listing of Novell Common Stock

   The shares of Novell common stock issued in connection with the merger will
be listed on the Nasdaq National Market.

(1) Effective November 1, 2000, Novell changed its method of accounting for
    revenue related to product sales to distribution channel partners to
    recognize such revenues upon the sell-through of the respective product
    from the channel partner to the end user. Novell believes the change in
    accounting principle is preferable based on guidance provided in SEC Staff
    Accounting Bulletin No. 101, Revenue Recognition in Financial Statements.
    No prior period amounts have been restated for this change. See Note K in
    the notes to Novell's unaudited consolidated financial statements included
    in its Form 10-Q for the three months ended January 31, 2001, incorporated

         SUMMARY UNAUDITED PRO FORMA COMBINED CONDENSED FINANCIAL DATA

   The following summary unaudited pro forma combined condensed financial data
have been provided to illustrate what the results of operations and financial
position of the combined business of Novell and Cambridge might have looked
like had the merger occurred at an earlier date. This information is provided
for illustrative purposes only and does not show what the results of operations
or financial position of Novell would have been if the merger actually occurred
on the dates assumed. In addition, this information does not indicate what the
combined company's future consolidated operating results or consolidated
financial position will be.

How the pro forma financial data was prepared

   This data was derived from the Novell unaudited pro forma combined condensed
statement of operations for the year ended October 31, 2000 and the three
months ended January 31, 2001 and the Novell unaudited pro forma combined
condensed balance sheet as of January 31, 2001. These statements give effect to
the merger accounted for using the purchase method of accounting. The unaudited
pro forma combined condensed statement of operations for the year ended October
31, 2000 and the three months ended January 31, 2001 assume the merger took
place on November 1, 1999. The unaudited pro forma combined condensed balance
sheet assumes the merger took place on January 31, 2001. See pro forma
statements beginning on page 62.

These pro forma financial statements have been based on assumptions

   These statements were prepared on the basis of assumptions described in the
notes thereto, including assumptions relating to the allocation of the amount
of consideration paid to the assets and liabilities of Cambridge based upon
preliminary estimates of their fair values. The actual allocation of the amount
of consideration paid may differ from those assumptions after valuations and
other procedures are performed after the closing has taken place.

Charges resulting from the merger

   Novell expects to incur a liability for the estimated costs incurred as a
result of the merger, such as costs resulting from vacating duplicative
Cambridge facilities and reducing headcount. This liability is included as part
of the allocation of the purchase price. The unaudited pro forma combined
condensed balance sheet includes the effect of these charges. These charges
will be reflected in Novell's consolidated financial statements in the period
in which the merger is consummated.

You should read these summary pro forma financial statements with the
historical financial statements

   The Novell summary unaudited pro forma combined condensed financial data
should be read in conjunction with the Novell unaudited pro forma combined
condensed financial statements and the related notes, which begin at page 62.
They should also be read in conjunction with the consolidated audited and
consolidated condensed unaudited financial statements of Novell and the
consolidated audited and consolidated unaudited financial statements of
Cambridge that are incorporated by reference in this proxy statement-
prospectus. The Novell summary unaudited pro forma combined condensed financial
data is not necessarily indicative of what the actual results of operations and
financial position would have been had the merger taken place on November 1,
1999 or January 31, 2001, and do not indicate future results of operations or
financial position.

   On May 22, 2001, Novell announced its fiscal 2001 second quarter financial
results, which have not been incorporated into these pro forma statements.
Novell reported total revenue of $241 million and a net loss of $151.3 million
or $0.48 per share for the second fiscal quarter ended April 30, 2001. This
loss included a $142 million ($0.45 per share) write-down of equity
investments. Total assets were $1.569 billion at the end of the second quarter.

Novell unaudited comparative per share data

   The following tables present certain unaudited historical and unaudited pro
forma per share data that reflect the completion of the merger. These data
should be read in conjunction with the Novell unaudited pro forma combined
condensed financial statements, and the historical financial statements of
Novell and Cambridge, incorporated by reference in this proxy statement-
prospectus. The Novell unaudited pro forma combined condensed per share data
does not necessarily indicate the operating results that would have been
achieved had the merger occurred at the beginning of the periods presented, and
does not indicate future results of operations or financial position.

   Options and other potential common securities have not been included in the
computation of pro forma diluted net loss per share as of January 31, 2001
because their effect would be antidilutive. The total number of Novell options
outstanding at January 31, 2001 that were antidilutive was 64,822,089.

   Calculation of book value per share amounts

   The pro forma book value per share is computed by dividing pro forma
shareholders' equity by the pro forma number of shares outstanding at the end
of each period for which the computation is made. Novell will not assume the
outstanding stock options of Cambridge upon the completion of the merger. For
purposes of computing the historical book value per share of Novell as of
October 31, 2000 and January 31, 2001,

historical book value of $1,245.1 million and $1,165.3 million, respectively,
was divided by historical actual shares outstanding of 327,618,192 and
317,653,609, respectively. For purposes of computing the historical book value
per share of Cambridge as of March 31, 2001, historical book value of $204.4
million was divided by historical actual shares outstanding of 63,532,271. For
purposes of computing the unaudited pro forma combined book value per share of
Novell as of January 31, 2001, pro forma book value of $1,396.0 million was
divided by pro forma shares outstanding of 360,093,501.

   Calculation of Cambridge equivalent pro forma per share amounts

   The Cambridge equivalent pro forma per share amounts are computed by
multiplying the Novell pro forma combined per share amounts by the exchange
ratio of 0.668 of a share of Novell common stock for each share of Cambridge
common stock.

   Because the market price of Novell common stock that you will receive in the
merger may increase or decrease before completion of the merger, you are urged
to obtain current market quotations.

                                  RISK FACTORS

   In evaluating the merger, you should carefully consider the discussion of
risks and uncertainties below and you should refer to the matters discussed
under the caption "Forward Looking Statements in this Proxy Statement--
Prospectus" on page 7.

   By voting in favor of the merger, you will be choosing to invest in Novell
common stock. An investment in Novell common stock involves a high degree of
risk. In addition to the other information contained in or incorporated by
reference into this proxy statement-prospectus, you should carefully consider
the following risk factors in deciding whether to vote for the merger.

Risks Related to the Merger

The market prices of common stock for Novell and Cambridge may fluctuate, but
the exchange ratio is fixed; you will receive 0.668 of a share of Novell common
stock for each share of Cambridge common stock despite any changes in the
market value of either Novell or Cambridge common stock.

   Upon completion of the merger as contemplated under the Agreement and Plan
of Reorganization, dated as of March 12, 2001, as amended as of May 24, 2001,
by and among Novell, Cambridge and Ceres Neptune Acquisition Corp., a wholly
owned subsidiary of Novell (the "merger agreement"), Novell will exchange 0.668
of a share of Novell common stock for each outstanding share of Cambridge
common stock. There will be no adjustment for changes in the market price of
either Novell common stock or Cambridge common stock, and Cambridge is not
permitted to withdraw from the merger or re-solicit the vote of its
stockholders solely because of subsequent changes in the market price of Novell
or Cambridge common stock. Accordingly, the specific dollar value of Novell
common stock you will receive upon completion of the merger will depend on the
market value of Novell common stock at the time of completion of the merger.
You should note that the companies' stock prices have historically been highly
volatile and that the value of the Novell common stock you will receive in the
merger may decline prior to or after the merger.

Although Novell and Cambridge intend for the merger to result in benefits to
the combined company, those benefits may not be realized. Additionally, neither
Novell nor Cambridge is experienced in organizing an integration of businesses
of this scale.

   Achieving the benefits of the merger will depend in part on the integration
of Novell's and Cambridge's personnel, operations and technology. The
integration of Novell and Cambridge will be a complex, time consuming and
expensive process and may disrupt Novell's and Cambridge's business if not
completed in a timely and efficient manner. The challenges involved in this
integration include the following:

  . Obtaining synergies from the companies' professional services
    organizations;

  . Obtaining synergies from the companies' service and product offerings
    effectively and quickly;

  . Coordinating sales efforts so that customers can do business easily with
    the combined company;

  . Integrating technology, back office, human resources, accounting and
    financial systems;

  . Bringing together marketing efforts so that the market receives useful
    information about the combined company;

  . Assimilating our employees into a common business culture; and

  . Retaining key officers and employees who possess the necessary skills and
    experience to quickly and effectively transition and integrate the
    businesses.

   Neither Novell nor Cambridge has experience in integrating operations on the
scale presented by the merger. The integration process will be complicated and
will involve a number of special risks in addition to the challenges described
above, including the possibility that management may be distracted from regular

business operations. It is not certain that Novell and Cambridge can be
successfully integrated in a timely manner or at all or that any of the
anticipated benefits will be realized. Failure to effectively complete the
integration could materially harm the business and operating results of the
combined company.

Client and employee uncertainty related to the merger could harm the combined
company.

   Novell's or Cambridge's customers may, in response to the announcement of
the merger, delay, defer or cancel purchasing decisions or terminate their
relationship with Novell or Cambridge. Delays, deferrals or cancellations of
purchasing decisions or any termination of their relationship with Novell or
Cambridge by Novell's or Cambridge's customers could seriously harm the
business of the combined company. Similarly, Novell and Cambridge employees may
experience uncertainty about their future role with the combined company. This
may adversely affect the combined company's ability to attract and retain key
management, sales, marketing, technical, services and administrative personnel.

Cambridge executive officers and directors have interests that may influence
them to support and approve the merger.

   Jack L. Messman, a director and the president and chief executive officer of
Cambridge, is also a director of Novell. Mr. Messman, as a condition to the
merger, shall become the president and chief executive officer of Novell. Mr.
Messman has entered into an employment agreement that will become effective
upon completion of the merger. Furthermore, Novell's compensation committee has
approved the grant of stock options to purchase Novell common stock and grants
of restricted stock to most officers of Cambridge on July 12, 2001. The
compensation committee also has approved the continuation of base salary and
incentive compensation for these Cambridge officers. These Cambridge officers
will also participate in the Novell Senior Management Severance Plan upon the
completion of the merger.

   In addition, John W. Poduska, Sr. and James D. Robinson, III, directors of
Cambridge designated by Cambridge, will become directors of Novell upon
completion of the merger. The Novell compensation committee has approved the
grant of options to purchase Novell common stock to these individuals.
Mr. Messman and all directors and some executive officers of Cambridge have
entered into voting agreements with Novell under which they have given Novell
the right to vote their Cambridge shares in favor of adopting the merger
agreement and approving the transactions contemplated thereunder. Cambridge
stockholders should consider whether these interests might have influenced
these directors and officers to support or recommend the merger.

Novell's operating results may suffer as a result of the impact of amortization
of goodwill relating to its proposed combination with Cambridge.

   Under generally accepted accounting principles in the United States, Novell
will account for the merger using the purchase method of accounting. Under
purchase accounting, Novell will record as the cost of acquiring the business
of Cambridge the following: the market value of Novell common stock issued in
connection with the merger, and the amount of direct transaction costs as the
cost of acquiring the business of Cambridge. Novell will allocate the total
cost to the fair value of individual assets acquired and liabilities assumed
from Cambridge, with the remaining cost being accounted for as goodwill.
Goodwill will be amortized over a four year period. As described in the Novell
Unaudited Pro Forma Combined Condensed Financial Statements section of this
proxy statement-prospectus, the amount of excess purchase cost allocated to
goodwill is estimated to be approximately $72.8 million. If goodwill were
amortized in equal quarterly amounts over a four-year period following
completion of the merger, the after-tax accounting charge attributable to
goodwill would be approximately $4.6 million per quarter and $18.2 million per
fiscal year. As a result, the purchase accounting treatment of the merger may
adversely affect the combined company's results of operations in the
foreseeable future, which could cause the market value of the combined
company's common stock to decline.

The price of Novell common stock may be affected by factors different from
those affecting the price of Cambridge common stock.

   When the merger is completed, holders of Cambridge common stock will become
holders of Novell common stock. Novell's business differs significantly from
that of Cambridge, and Novell's results of operations, as well as the price of
Novell common stock, may be affected by factors different from those affecting
Cambridge's results of operations and the price of Cambridge common stock.

If the conditions to the merger are not met, the merger will not occur.

   Several conditions must be satisfied or waived to complete the merger. These
conditions are described under "Conditions to completion of the merger" and in
detail in the merger agreement. Novell and Cambridge cannot assure you that
each of the conditions will be satisfied. If the conditions are not satisfied
or waived, the merger will not occur or will be delayed, and Novell and
Cambridge each may lose some or all of the intended benefits of the merger.

If the merger is not completed, Novell's and Cambridge's stock prices and
future business and operations could be harmed.

   If the merger is not completed, Novell and Cambridge may be subject to the
following material risks:

  . Cambridge may be required to pay Novell a termination fee of $7.3
    million, plus any expenses incurred in collecting such fee;

  . the price of Novell or Cambridge common stock may decline to the extent
    that the current market prices of Novell and Cambridge common stock
    reflect a market assumption that the merger will be completed; and

  . Novell and Cambridge will incur significant costs related to the merger,
    such as legal, accounting and some of the fees and expenses of their
    financial advisors, which costs must be paid even if the merger is not
    completed.

   Further, with respect to Cambridge, if the merger is terminated and
Cambridge's board of directors determines to pursue another merger or business
combination, it is not certain that Cambridge will be able to find a partner
willing to pay an equivalent or more attractive price than that which would be
paid in the merger. In addition, while the merger agreement is in effect and
subject to limited exceptions described in this proxy statement-prospectus,
Cambridge and its officers, board members and advisors are generally prohibited
from soliciting, initiating or knowingly encouraging or entering into
extraordinary transactions, such as a merger, sale of assets or other business
combination, with any party other than Novell.

The merger will result in substantial costs whether or not completed.

   The merger will result in significant costs to Novell and Cambridge.
Excluding costs associated with combining the operations of the two companies
and severance benefits and costs associated with discontinuing some redundant
business activities, direct transaction costs are estimated at approximately
$9.7 million. These costs are expected to consist primarily of fees for
investment bankers, attorneys, accountants, filing fees and financial printing.
The aggregate amount of these costs may be greater than currently anticipated.
A substantial amount of these costs will be incurred whether or not the merger
is completed.

Risks Associated with Combined Company Operations

Some executive officers and key personnel are critical to the business of the
combined company and these officers and key personnel may not remain with the
company in the future.

   The success of the combined company following the merger depends upon the
continued service of some executive officers and other key personnel. Upon
completion of the merger, Jack L. Messman, Cambridge's chief executive officer
and president, will become the chief executive officer and president of Novell.
Three of Novell's Senior Vice-Presidents have left Novell in the past year and
any of Novell's other officers could leave in the future. If the combined
company loses the services of Mr. Messman or one or more of its other executive
officers or key employees, or if one or more of these individuals decides to
join a competitor or otherwise compete directly or indirectly with the combined
company, the combined company's business, operating results and financial
condition could be seriously harmed.

Some of the combined company's venture capital fund investments have become
impaired. Additional venture capital fund investments could become impaired.

   Novell's investment portfolio includes investments made for strategic
business purposes, such as investments through the Novell Venture Fund. Novell
Venture Fund investments are generally in small capitalization stocks in the
high-technology industry sector and funds managed by venture capitalists.
Similarly, Cambridge has also invested in private companies in the high-
technology industry. Many of these investments by Novell and Cambridge might
become other than temporarily impaired. During its second fiscal quarter ended
April 30, 2001, Novell recorded an impairment charge related to some of the
investments in its portfolio whose market value had experienced an other than
temporary decline. The charge totaled $142 million and included Novell's $100
million investment in marchFIRST. As of April 30, 2001, unrealized losses on
Novell's public equity securities totaled approximately $9.3 million. The
combined company will have to record impairment losses under generally accepted
accounting principles for other than temporarily impaired investments.

The combined company may not be able to hire and retain sufficient development,
consulting, managerial and technical sales personnel that it needs to succeed
because these personnel are limited in number and in high demand.

   If the combined company fails to hire and retain sufficient numbers of
development, consulting, managerial and technical sales personnel, its
business, operating results and financial condition could be harmed.
Competition for qualified development, consulting, managerial and technical
sales personnel is intense as these personnel are in limited supply, and the
combined company might not be able to hire and retain sufficient numbers of
such personnel to grow its business. Although Novell intends to increase the
size of its development and consulting staff through the acquisition of
Cambridge, Cambridge's personnel may not remain with Cambridge or with the
combined company after the closing of the acquisition.

   In addition, the market price of Novell's common stock has declined
substantially in the last year. Consequently, potential employees may perceive
Novell's equity incentives, such as stock options, as less attractive, and
current employees whose options are no longer priced below market value may
choose not to remain employed with the combined company. As a result, the
combined company's ability to attract employees may be adversely affected. New
options granted to Cambridge's key employees or other employees at the current
market price of Novell's common stock may not be sufficient to retain these
employees. Finally, should Novell's stock price substantially decline, the
retention value of stock options will decline, and Novell's employees may
choose not to remain with the combined company.

Novell and Cambridge face increased risks in conducting a global business,
which may damage business results.

   Novell and Cambridge are multi-national corporations with offices and
subsidiaries around the world and as such, they face risks in doing business
abroad that they do not face domestically. Certain aspects inherent in
transacting business internationally could negatively impact the operating
results of the combined company, including:

  . costs and difficulties in staffing and managing international operations;

  . unexpected changes in regulatory requirements;

  . tariffs and other trade barriers;

  . difficulties in enforcing contractual and intellectual property rights;

  . longer payment cycles;

  . local political and economic conditions;

  . potentially adverse tax consequences, including restrictions on
    repatriating earnings and the threat of "double taxation"; and

  . fluctuations in currency exchange rates.

Novell Specific Risks that Could Adversely Impact the Combined Company

Novell may not be successful at introducing new technologies.

   Novell expects to achieve widespread acceptance and adoption of its Net
services and e-solutions products, Novell Directory Services ("NDS"), and the
products and applications that take advantage of directory services. The
combined company's success with Net services and NDS solutions is dependent on
a number of factors including, but not limited to, the following:

  . development of key Net services and directory products and upgrades;

  . the acceptance of new products by large industry partners, and the
    marketing of new products through appropriate channels of distribution;
    and

  . the acceptance of new products by major accounts.

   The Company has only had limited success in introducing new technologies,
and there can be no assurance of success with Net services or NDS solutions.

Novell has experienced delays in the introduction and market acceptance of new
products due to various factors.

   Novell has experienced delays in the introduction of new products due to:
the complexity of software products, the need for extensive testing of software
to ensure compatibility of new releases with a wide variety of application
software and hardware devices, and the need to "debug" products prior to
extensive distribution. Significant delays in developing, completing or
shipping new or enhanced products would adversely affect the combined company.

   Moreover, the combined company may experience delays in market acceptance of
new releases of products as it engages in marketing and education of the user
base regarding the advantages and system requirements for new products and as
customers evaluate the advantages and disadvantages of upgrading. Novell has
encountered these issues on prior new releases of its products, and expects
that it will encounter such issues in the future. The combined company's
ability to achieve desired levels of sales growth depends at least in part on
the successful completion, introduction and sale of new versions of its
products. There can be no assurance that the combined company will be able to
respond effectively to technological changes or new

product announcements by others, or that its research and development efforts
will be successful. Should the combined company experience material delays or
sales shortfalls with respect to new product releases, its sales and net income
could be adversely affected.

Novell's existing product sales may deteriorate more rapidly than sales of new
products increase.

   Novell has several existing products that it has been selling and upgrading
for many years. Sales of these products have been declining and may continue to
decline at a faster rate than Novell is able to increase sales of new products
or technologies.

The combined company's existing relationships with other information technology
services organizations may be impaired.

   Novell relies on existing relationships with information technology services
organizations that recommend, design and implement solutions for their
customers' eBusiness that include Novell Net services products. A change in the
willingness of these information technology service organizations to do
business with Novell could undercut Novell's efforts to become a solutions-
based Net services software company.

If third parties claim that Novell infringes upon their intellectual property,
Novell's ability to use some technologies and products could be limited and it
may incur significant costs to resolve these claims.

   Litigation regarding intellectual property rights is common in the Internet
and software industries. Novell expects third-party infringement claims
involving Internet technologies and software products and services to increase.
If an infringement claim is filed against Novell, it may be prevented from
using some technologies and may incur significant costs to resolve the claim.

   Novell has in the past received letters suggesting that it is infringing
upon the intellectual rights of others, and it may from time to time encounter
disputes over rights and obligations concerning intellectual property. Novell's
products and services may be found to infringe on the intellectual property
rights of third parties.

   In addition, Novell has agreed, and may agree in the future, to indemnify
customers against claims that its products infringe upon the intellectual
property rights of others. Novell could incur substantial costs in defending
itself and its customers against infringement claims. In the event of a claim
of infringement, Novell and its customers may be required to obtain one or more
licenses from third parties. In such instances, Novell or its customers may not
be able to obtain necessary licenses from third parties at a reasonable cost or
at all.

Cambridge Specific Risks that Could Adversely Impact the Combined Company

Cambridge's business may be negatively affected if Cambridge does not continue
to adapt to the Internet's rapid technological change, evolving business
practices and changing client requirements.

   The Internet professional services market is characterized by rapidly
changing technology, evolving business practices and changing client needs.
Accordingly, Cambridge's future success, and thus, the combined company's
future success, will depend, in part, on its ability to continue to adapt and
meet these challenges. Among the most important challenges facing Cambridge are
the need to continue to:

  . effectively identify and use leading technologies;

  . develop strategic and technical expertise;

  . influence and respond to emerging industry standards and other technology
    changes and to orient management teams to capitalize on these changes;

  . recruit and retain qualified project personnel;

  . enhance current services;

  . develop new services that meet changing customer needs; and

  . effectively advertise and market its services.

Cambridge's business is dependent upon continued growth in the use of the
Internet by its clients, prospective clients and their customers and suppliers.

   If the number of users on the Internet does not increase and commerce over
the Internet does not become more accepted and widespread, demand for
Cambridge's services may decrease and, as a result, revenues of the combined
company may suffer. Factors that may affect Internet usage or electronic
commerce adoption include:

  . actual or perceived lack of security;

  . lack of access and ease of use;

  . inconsistent quality of service;

  . increases in access costs to the Internet;

  . actual or threatened computer "viruses" or other malicious code;

  . excessive governmental regulation or the imposition of taxation on
    Internet transactions;

  . uncertainty regarding intellectual property ownership;

  . reluctance to adopt new business methods; and

  . costs associated with replacing obsolete infrastructure.

Cambridge contracts contain pricing risks.

   Cambridge derives a significant portion of its revenue from fixed-price,
fixed-time contracts. Because of the complex nature of the services Cambridge
provides, it is sometimes difficult to accurately estimate the cost, scope and
duration of particular client engagements. If Cambridge does not accurately
estimate the resources required for a project, does not accurately assess the
scope of work associated with a project, does not manage the project properly,
or does not satisfy its obligations in a manner consistent with the contract,
then Cambridge's costs to complete the project could increase substantially.
Cambridge has occasionally had to commit unanticipated additional resources to
complete projects, and it may have to take similar action in the future.
Cambridge may not be compensated for these additional costs or the commitment
of these additional resources, which could negatively impact the operating
results of the combined company.

Cambridge derives a portion of its revenues from services performed for dot-com
companies.

   Many dot-com companies are recently organized, have limited operating
histories, have significant net losses and have limited corporate sponsorship
or financial resources. The volatility of the stock market in recent months has
made it difficult for many dot-com companies to raise funds, and a number of
companies have gone bankrupt. As a result, Cambridge may experience greater
than expected customer loss or an inability to collect fees from customers in a
timely manner, if at all. Cambridge's ability to achieve revenue and earnings
targets or maintain an adequate cash position could be adversely affected.

Cambridge's clients can cancel or reduce the scope of their engagements with
Cambridge on short notice.

   If Cambridge's clients cancel or reduce the scope of an engagement with
Cambridge, Cambridge may be unable to reassign its professionals to new
engagements without delay. Personnel and related costs constitute a substantial
portion of Cambridge's operating expenses. Because these expenses are
relatively fixed, and because Cambridge establishes the levels of these
expenses well in advance of any particular quarter, cancellations or reductions
in the scope of client engagements could result in the underutilization of
Cambridge's professional services employees, causing significant reductions in
operating results for a particular quarter.

Cambridge's failure to meet client expectations or deliver error-free services
could result in losses and negative publicity.

   Many of Cambridge's engagements involve information technology solutions
that are critical to the clients' businesses. Significant defects or errors in
these solutions or failure to meet or manage clients' specifications or
expectations could result in:

  . delayed or lost revenues due to adverse client reaction;

  . requirements to provide additional services to a client at no charge;

  . negative publicity about Cambridge and its services, which could
    adversely affect Cambridge's ability to attract or retain clients; and

  . claims for substantial damages against Cambridge, regardless of
    Cambridge's responsibility for such failure.

Cambridge has a recent history of operating losses influenced in part by
general economic conditions, and may not be able to reverse this trend in the
near future.

   Primarily as a result of a slowdown in growth in demand for Cambridge's e-
Solutions services, a slowing global economy and increased cost of recruiting
and retaining project personnel, Cambridge has incurred losses. Cambridge's
revenues and results of operations are influenced by general economic and
industry-specific trends. Cambridge's clients and potential clients have and
may continue to substantially reduce their information technology and related
budgets. Cambridge may not be able to achieve or sustain profitability on a
quarterly or annual basis in the future.

The Internet professional services market is highly competitive, with low
barriers to entry. If Cambridge cannot effectively compete, its revenue may
decline.

   The Internet professional services market is relatively new and highly
competitive. Cambridge's competitors include a wide variety of Internet-focused
professional service firms, management consulting companies, traditional
information technology service firms, systems integration firms and internal
information technology departments of prospective clients. There are relatively
low barriers to entry in the Internet professional services market. Current or
future competitors may develop or offer services that are comparable or
superior to those of Cambridge at a lower price, which could significantly
decrease Cambridge's revenues.

Cambridge may not be able to protect its contractual rights, which may
adversely affect its business.

   Cambridge generally enters into contractual relationships with its employees
that protect its confidential information, and impose non-solicitation
obligations on employees. In the event that Cambridge's trade secrets or other
proprietary information are misappropriated, Cambridge's business could be
seriously harmed. In addition, Cambridge may not be able to timely detect
unauthorized use of its intellectual property and take appropriate steps to
enforce its rights. In the event Cambridge is unable to enforce these
contractual obligations, its business could be adversely affected.

Cambridge's quarterly revenues and operating results have fluctuated and may
continue to fluctuate.

   Cambridge's quarterly revenues and operating results are volatile and
difficult to predict. Cambridge's quarterly operating results have varied in
the past and could vary significantly from quarter to quarter in the future.
Factors that may cause Cambridge's results to fluctuate include:

  . the number and significance of client engagements commenced and completed
    during a period;

  . changes in demand for Cambridge's consulting and implementation services
    and third party products or solutions for which Cambridge performs
    integration services;

  . Cambridge's ability to obtain new and follow-on client engagements;

  . the number of working days in a period;

  . Cambridge's ability to collect accounts receivable from its clients which
    may not pay Cambridge, may pay Cambridge only a portion of what it is
    owed, or may delay paying Cambridge for an extended period;

  . the introduction of new service models by Cambridge or its competitors;

  . changes in market conditions that could impact the value of securities
    owned by Cambridge or the value of Cambridge's investment in Cambridge
    Technology Capital Fund I;

  . unanticipated negative outcomes of litigation involving Cambridge;

  . Cambridge's ability to attract, train and retain skilled personnel in all
    areas of its business; and

  . Cambridge's ability, in a consistent and accurate manner, to manage
    costs, including personnel costs and support services costs.

                 THE SPECIAL MEETING OF CAMBRIDGE STOCKHOLDERS

Proxy statement-prospectus

   This proxy statement-prospectus is being furnished to you in connection with
the solicitation of proxies by Cambridge's board of directors in connection
with the proposed merger. This proxy statement-prospectus is first being
furnished to stockholders of Cambridge on or about May 30, 2001.

Date, time and place of the special meeting

   The special meeting of stockholders of Cambridge is scheduled as follows:

   July 10, 2001
   10:00 a.m., local time
   Eight Cambridge Center
   Cambridge, Massachusetts 02142

Purpose of the special meeting

   The special meeting is being held so that stockholders of Cambridge can
consider and vote upon a proposal to adopt the merger agreement and transact
any other business that properly comes before the special meeting or any
adjournment thereof. Adoption of the merger agreement will also constitute
approval of the merger and the other transactions contemplated by the merger
agreement.

   If the stockholders of Cambridge adopt the merger agreement and the other
conditions to completion of the merger are satisfied or waived, Ceres Neptune
Acquisition Corp. will merge with and into Cambridge, and Cambridge will
survive the merger as a wholly owned subsidiary of Novell. You will be entitled
to receive 0.668 of a share of Novell common stock for each share of Cambridge
common stock you hold on the effective date of the merger.

Stockholder record date for the special meeting

   Cambridge's board of directors has fixed the close of business on May 21,
2001 as the record date for determination of Cambridge stockholders entitled to
notice of, and to vote at, the special meeting. On the record date, there were
63,532,722 shares of Cambridge common stock outstanding, held by approximately
2,633 holders of record.

Majority vote of Cambridge stockholders required for adoption of the merger
agreement

   A majority of the outstanding shares of Cambridge common stock entitled to
vote at the special meeting must be represented, either in person or by proxy,
to constitute a quorum at the special meeting. The affirmative vote of the
holders of at least a majority of the shares of Cambridge common stock
outstanding on the record date is required to adopt the merger agreement. You
are entitled to one vote for each share of Cambridge common stock held by you
on the record date on each proposal to be presented to stockholders at the
special meeting.

   On the record date for the special meeting, directors and executive officers
of Cambridge and their affiliates held approximately 16,329,840 shares of
Cambridge common stock representing approximately 25.7% of all outstanding
shares of Cambridge common stock as of the record date.

   All Cambridge executive officers and directors, in their capacity as
stockholders, have agreed, subject to the terms and conditions of a voting
agreement with Novell, to vote their shares of Cambridge common stock in favor
of the adoption of the merger agreement. As of the record date these
stockholders held approximately 1.8% of the outstanding shares of Cambridge
common stock as of the record date.

Proxies

   All shares of Cambridge common stock represented by properly executed
proxies received before or at the special meeting will, unless the proxies are
revoked, be voted in accordance with the instructions indicated on the proxies.
If no instructions are indicated on a properly executed proxy, the shares will
be voted FOR adoption of the merger agreement. You are urged to vote your proxy
through the Internet, the telephone or mark a box on the proxy to indicate how
to vote your shares.

   If a properly executed proxy is returned and the stockholder has instructed
the proxies to abstain from voting on adoption of the merger agreement, the
Cambridge common stock represented by the proxy will be considered present at
the special meeting for purposes of determining a quorum, but will not be voted
for or against the merger, thereby having the effect of being a vote against
the merger. If your shares are held in an account at a brokerage firm or bank,
you must instruct such institution how to vote your shares. If an executed
proxy card is returned by a broker holding shares in the name of a brokerage
firm or bank, which indicates that the broker or bank does not have
instructions or discretionary authority to vote on adoption of the merger
agreement, the shares will be considered present at the meeting for the purpose
of determining a quorum, but will not be considered to have been voted in favor
of adoption of the merger agreement. Your broker or bank will vote your shares
only if you provide instructions on how to vote by following the information
provided to you by your broker or bank.

   Because adoption of the merger agreement requires the affirmative vote of a
majority of the shares of Cambridge common stock outstanding on the record
date, abstentions, failures to vote and broker non-votes will have the same
effect as a vote against adoption of the merger agreement.

   Cambridge does not expect that any matter other than adoption of the merger
agreement will be brought before the special meeting. If, however, other
matters are properly presented, the persons named as proxies will vote in
accordance with their judgment with respect to those matters, unless authority
to do so is withheld in the proxy.

   You may revoke your proxy at any time before it is voted by:

  .  notifying in writing the Secretary of Cambridge at Eight Cambridge
     Center, Cambridge, MA 02142;

  .  properly submitting a subsequent proxy;

  .  appearing in person and voting at the special meeting; or

  .  if you voted electronically through the Internet or by telephone,
     changing your vote by voting again at a later date, using the same
     procedures.

   Attendance at the special meeting will not in and of itself constitute the
revocation of a proxy.

   You should not send in any stock certificates with your proxies. A
transmittal form with instructions for surrender of stock certificates for
Cambridge common stock will be mailed to you as soon as practicable after
completion of the merger.

Voting electronically or by telephone

   Because Delaware, the state in which Cambridge is incorporated, permits
electronic submission of proxies through the Internet or by telephone, instead
of submitting proxies by mail on the enclosed proxy card or voting
instructions, stockholders have the option to vote electronically by submitting
their proxies or voting instructions through the Internet or by telephone.
Please review your proxy card for exact instructions on how to vote on the
Internet or by telephone. Please note that there are separate arrangements for
using the Internet and telephone depending on whether your shares are
registered in Cambridge's stock records in your name or in the name of a
brokerage firm or bank.

   The Internet and telephone procedures described below for submitting your
proxy or voting instructions are designed to authenticate stockholders'
identities, to allow stockholders to have their shares voted and to confirm
that their instructions have been properly recorded. Stockholders submitting
proxies or voting instructions via the Internet should understand that there
may be costs associated with electronic access, such as usage charges from
Internet access providers and telephone companies, which would be borne by the
stockholder.

   Cambridge holders whose shares are held in certificate form (of record) may
submit their proxies:

  .  through the Internet by visiting a website established for that purpose
     at proxyvoting.com/Cambridge Technology Partners and following the
     instructions; or

  .  by telephone by calling the toll-free number 800.840.1208 and following
     the recorded instructions.

   Cambridge holders whose shares are held in their brokerage account or
through a bank need to check their proxy card and the instructions for voting
electronically.

Solicitation of proxies

   Novell and Cambridge will equally share the expenses incurred in connection
with the printing and mailing of this proxy statement-prospectus. Cambridge
will also request banks, brokers and other intermediaries holding shares of
Cambridge common stock beneficially owned by others to send this proxy
statement-prospectus to, and obtain proxies from, the beneficial owners and
will reimburse the holders for their reasonable expenses in so doing.
Solicitation of proxies by mail may be supplemented by telephone, telegram and
other electronic means, advertisements and personal solicitation by the
directors, officers or employees of Cambridge. No additional compensation will
be paid to directors, officers or employees for such solicitation.

   You should not send in any stock certificates with your proxy card. A
transmittal letter with instructions for the surrender of stock certificates
will be mailed to you as soon as practicable after completion of the merger.

                                   THE MERGER

   This section of the proxy statement-prospectus describes material aspects of
the proposed merger, including the merger agreement. While we believe that the
description covers the material terms of the merger, this summary may not
contain all of the information that is important to you. You should read this
entire proxy statement-prospectus and the other documents we refer to carefully
for a more complete understanding of the merger. In addition, we incorporate
important business and financial information about Novell and Cambridge into
this proxy statement-prospectus by reference. You may obtain the information
incorporated by reference into this proxy statement-prospectus without charge
by following the instructions in the section entitled "Where You Can Find More
Information" on page 77 of this proxy statement-prospectus.

Effect of the merger and conversion of Cambridge common stock

   Upon the merger, Ceres Neptune Acquisition Corp., a wholly owned subsidiary
of Novell, will merge with and into Cambridge. Cambridge will survive the
merger as a wholly owned subsidiary of Novell. The stockholders of Cambridge
will become stockholders of Novell. The Novell Restated Certificate of
Incorporation, the Novell Bylaws and the laws of the State of Delaware will
govern their rights as stockholders. See "Comparison of Rights of Holders of
Cambridge Common Stock and Novell Common Stock" on page 70 of this proxy
statement-prospectus.

   At the closing of the merger, by virtue of the merger and without any action
on the part of Novell, Ceres Neptune, Cambridge or any of their security-
holders, each share of Cambridge common stock issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the effective time will be cancelled and extinguished and
automatically converted into the right to receive 0.668 of a share of Novell
common stock. Each Cambridge stockholder will need to surrender the certificate
representing such share(s) of Cambridge common stock in the manner provided for
in the merger agreement, or in the case of a lost, stolen or destroyed
certificate, upon delivery of an affidavit, and bond, if required.

   The exchange ratio in the merger will be appropriately adjusted in the event
of any stock split, reverse stock split, stock dividend, extraordinary cash
dividends, reorganization, recapitalization, reclassification, combination,
exchange of shares or other like change with respect to Novell common stock or
Cambridge common stock occurring prior to the consummation of the merger. No
fractional shares of Novell common stock will be issued in connection with the
merger. Instead you will receive cash, without interest, in lieu of the
issuance of any fractional shares of Novell common stock that would have been
otherwise issuable to you as a result of the merger. Each share of Cambridge
common stock held by Cambridge or any direct or indirect wholly owned
subsidiary of Cambridge immediately prior to the closing of the merger will be
cancelled and extinguished.

Background of the merger

   In March 2000, Novell engaged Morgan Stanley & Co. Incorporated as financial
advisors to assist in considering strategic options, including possible
acquisitions and business combinations. During the latter part of 2000 and
early 2001, senior management and the board of directors of Novell considered
various strategic alternatives to increase stockholder value, including a sale
of Novell in whole or in part and a spin-off or joint venture involving Novell
subsidiaries.

   On January 19, 2001, following a meeting of the Novell board in San Jose,
California, Dr. Eric E. Schmidt, chairman, president and chief executive
officer of Novell, approached Jack L. Messman, the president, chief executive
officer and a director of Cambridge, regarding a possible strategic combination
between the two companies. Mr. Messman is currently, and has been since 1985, a
director of Novell and he is also a director of Safeguard Scientifics, Inc. Dr.
Schmidt and Mr. Messman discussed the companies' histories, relevant
operational issues, stockholder bases and key employees.

   On February 1, 2001, the Novell board of directors met to consider the
potential acquisition of Cambridge. The board considered the possibility of Mr.
Messman becoming the chief executive officer of a combined entity. The board
authorized management to continue discussions with Cambridge.

   On February 2, 2001, Dr. Schmidt called Mr. Messman to continue their
discussion and during this discussion Dr. Schmidt suggested that Mr. Messman
replace him as president and chief executive officer of Novell effective upon
the closing of any eventual transaction between the parties.

   On February 6, 2001, Dr. Schmidt, Mr. Messman and Warren V. Musser, the
chairman of the board of Cambridge and, at the time, the chief executive
officer of Safeguard, met in Cambridge, Massachusetts, to continue these
discussions.

   On February 7, 2001, Cambridge retained Salomon Smith Barney Inc. as its
financial advisor and Morgan, Lewis & Bockius LLP as its special transaction
counsel in connection with a possible transaction with Novell. Salomon Smith
Barney received several inquiries from industry participants and financial
investors regarding potential transactions involving Cambridge. None of the
inquiries received by Salomon Smith Barney resulted in serious negotiations and
no party other than Novell conducted due diligence.

   Also on February 7, 2001, Dennis Raney, executive vice president and chief
financial officer of Novell, met with members of Cambridge management in
Cambridge, Massachusetts to discuss the merits of combining Novell's and
Cambridge's operations.

   On February 9, 2001, the Cambridge board of directors met to discuss a
possible transaction with Novell. At the meeting, Mr. Messman outlined the
advantages and disadvantages of such a transaction. Following Mr. Messman's
presentation, Howard L. Shecter of Morgan Lewis made a presentation to the
board regarding the directors' duties and responsibilities in considering a
potential transaction with Novell. Salomon Smith Barney then made a
presentation to the board regarding possible transaction structures. The
attorneys for Novell and Cambridge began conducting their respective legal due
diligence reviews on February 9, 2001.

   On February 10, 2001, Willard Smith, Novell's vice president of mergers and
acquisitions, and representatives from Ernst & Young LLP, Novell's auditors and

president, general counsel and secretary, John J. Gavin Jr., senior vice
president, chief financial officer and treasurer, Gerard Van Kemmel, executive
vice president and chief operating officer, and Alan J. Friedman, senior vice
president--human resources, and Salomon Smith Barney, to conduct business and
financial due diligence.

   On February 12, 2001, Mr. Messman met in San Jose, California with Dr.
Schmidt, John A. Young, a director of Novell, and Larry W. Sonsini, a director
of Novell and a member of Novell's outside legal counsel, Wilson Sonsini
Goodrich & Rosati, Professional Corporation, to have further discussions
regarding a possible transaction between Cambridge and Novell.

   Also on February 12, 2001, members of Cambridge management, including Mr.
LaSala, Mr. Gavin, Mr. Friedman, and Gary F. Schuster, senior vice president--
communications, and Salomon Smith Barney met in San Jose, California with
members of Novell management, including Mr. Raney, Mr. Smith, Dr. Carl S.
Ledbetter, chief technology officer, Alex Salehi, vice president of worldwide
consulting services and Ronald Foster, vice president and corporate controller
and Morgan Stanley, to conduct business and financial due diligence on Novell.

   During the period between February 12, 2001 and March 12, 2001, Wilson
Sonsini and Morgan Lewis continued their respective legal due diligence reviews
and engaged in discussions regarding the terms and conditions of the proposed
merger.

   The Novell board of directors met on February 13, 2001 and was updated by
management and its legal and financial advisors on the status of discussions
with Cambridge. On February 14, 2001, Mr. Messman had a

telephone conversation with Dr. Schmidt, and Dr. Schmidt invited Mr. Messman to
make a presentation to the Novell board of directors.

with representatives from Morgan Stanley to review the merits of the proposed
strategic combination.

   On February 26, 2001 and February 27, 2001, members of the Novell and
Cambridge senior management teams and their respective financial advisors held
a series of conference calls and meetings to review preliminary terms and
continue discussions regarding a proposed combination. As part of these
discussions, Mr. Messman and Mr. Gavin met in San Jose, California with Messrs.
Schmidt, Young and Sonsini.

   On February 27, 2001, the Novell board of directors met to discuss the
results of the meetings between the management teams of Novell and Cambridge.

board with regard to the proposed transaction. Additionally, Mr. Messman met
with members of Novell senior management in Provo, Utah.

   On February 28, 2001, members of the Cambridge board of directors met with
Cambridge senior management and Salomon Smith Barney to discuss the status of
discussions between Novell and Cambridge. Mr. Messman provided a detailed
review, including a summary of the diligence efforts and review of the
strategic rationale and financial rationale for the proposed transaction.

   From March 2, 2001 through March 6, 2001, Novell and its financial advisors
met with Cambridge and its financial advisor in the United States and in Europe
to conduct further due diligence and review the potential transaction benefits.

   From March 6, 2001 through March 11, 2001, representatives from Novell and
Cambridge and its financial advisor and their respective advisors continued to
negotiate the terms of the proposed merger, including the exchange ratio,
restrictions on Cambridge's ability to pursue alternative transactions,
representations, warranties, consents, termination provisions and conditions to
the closing of the merger.

   On March 8, 2001, the Novell board of directors met to review reports by
Novell's management and Novell's legal and financial advisors on the status of
due diligence and negotiations with Cambridge. The board discussed the reports
and instructed management and Novell's legal and financial advisors to continue
with due diligence and negotiations.

   On March 9, 2001, the Cambridge board met via telephone. Present at the
meeting were the directors, senior management of Cambridge, Salomon Smith
Barney and Howard L. Shecter of Morgan Lewis. Mr. Messman began the meeting by
reviewing the status of the proposed transaction with Novell and by providing a
strategic overview. He then summarized the diligence efforts to date. Following
Mr. Messman's presentation, Salomon Smith Barney presented an analysis of the
financial terms of the proposed merger with Novell and delivered its oral
opinion, subsequently confirmed in writing as of March 12, 2001, as to the
fairness of the exchange ratio, from a financial point of view, to the holders
of Cambridge common stock. Mr. Shecter then made a presentation summarizing the
status of negotiations on the merger agreement and the results of Morgan
Lewis's diligence review to date. Mr. Gavin then updated the board on
Cambridge's financial due diligence review of Novell.

   On March 12, 2001, the Novell board met with Novell management and its
advisors to review the proposed terms of the acquisition of Cambridge. At the
meeting, Novell's legal advisors discussed the terms of the merger agreement
and related documents. Novell's financial advisors then gave a presentation to
the board. The board discussed, among other things, the status of negotiations,
the potential benefits and risks of the transaction and the principal terms of
the proposed merger. Following discussion, the Novell board approved

the transaction on the terms presented with instructions to management to
negotiate and finalize the open issues and to sign the merger agreement later
that day.

   Also on March 12, 2001, the Cambridge board met to review the terms of the
transaction. At this meeting, the members of management of Cambridge discussed
the results of the negotiations and the terms of the proposed merger, including
status and timing of the transaction, pricing and valuation of the proposed
merger, strategies and business opportunities with Novell, various business
issues relating to the merger, and a review of Novell's financial performance
and prospects. Mr. Shecter made a presentation to the Cambridge board during
which he reminded the directors of their duties and responsibilities under
Delaware law. He then summarized the results of Morgan Lewis's due diligence
review and outlined the terms of the proposed merger agreement, including
restrictions on Cambridge's ability to pursue alternative transactions, closing
conditions and termination provisions, the voting agreement, affiliate
agreements and other relevant documents. Lastly, Mr. Shecter identified the
final outstanding legal issues, and he apprised the Cambridge board that some
officers and directors of Cambridge, including Mr. Messman, had interests which
might conflict with the interests of Cambridge stockholders. Salomon Smith
Barney then reviewed its March 9, 2001 presentation and confirmed its opinion
as to the fairness of the exchange ratio, from a financial point of view, to
the holders of Cambridge common stock. Following these presentations and the
related discussions by the Cambridge board, the Cambridge board of directors
concluded that the merger was in the best interests of Cambridge stockholders,
declared the merger advisable, approved the proposed terms of the merger and
the merger agreement in substantially the form presented, authorized
Cambridge's officers to complete the negotiations and execute the merger
agreement and resolved to recommend that Cambridge stockholders vote to adopt
the merger agreement. In connection with the merger, the board also resolved to
amend the Cambridge stockholder rights plan to exempt Novell and the merger
from the provisions of the rights plan. Warren Musser, a Cambridge director who
was then the chief executive officer of Safeguard, abstained from the vote
citing unique investment company issues faced by Safeguard as a result of the
proposed transaction as the reason for abstention.

   After the close of trading on March 12, 2001, Cambridge, Novell and Ceres
Neptune entered into the merger agreement and Mr. Messman entered into a voting
agreement with Novell. In addition, Cambridge amended its stockholder rights
plan. Immediately following the signing of the merger agreement, Novell and
Cambridge issued a joint press release announcing the merger.

   On May 22, 2001, Novell and Jack L. Messman entered into an employment
agreement concerning Mr.  Messman's employment as chief executive officer and
president of Novell following the merger. Please see the section entitled "--
Interests of Cambridge directors and officers in the merger--Jack L. Messman"
on pages 42 and 43 of this proxy statement-prospectus for a summary of the
terms of the employment agreement.

   As of May 24, 2001, Cambridge, Novell and Ceres Neptune entered into
amendment no. 1 to the merger agreement which provides for the cancellation of
all outstanding Cambridge options and for the termination of the Cambridge
stock plans at the closing. In addition, the amendment provides for the grant
of Novell stock options to some Cambridge executives, non-executives and
directors and for the grant of restricted shares of Novell stock to some
Cambridge executives. Please see the section entitled "--Equity grants and
employee benefits after completion of the merger for Cambridge employees" on
pages 44 to 46 of this proxy statement-prospectus for a summary of these
grants.

Joint reasons for the merger

   The boards of directors of Novell and Cambridge have determined that a
combined company would be positioned to compete more effectively in the market,
thereby increasing the potential for improved long-term operating and financial
results. In particular, the boards believe that the merger will create the
opportunity for Novell and Cambridge to:

  . provide their customers with new Web-based products and services that
    will better serve the needs of customers;

  . develop software products that help extend businesses to better utilize
    the Internet; and

  . develop products around leading application platforms and other
    information technology resources supported by Net services software from
    Novell.

Recommendation of, and factors considered by, the Cambridge board of directors

   At a meeting of the Cambridge board of directors on March 12, 2001, after
due consideration, the Cambridge board:

  . determined that the merger is in the best interests of Cambridge and its
    stockholders;

  . approved the merger and the merger agreement; and

  . determined to recommend that the stockholders of Cambridge adopt the
    merger agreement and approve the transactions contemplated thereby.

Accordingly, the Cambridge board of directors recommends that the Cambridge
stockholders vote FOR adoption of the merger agreement.

   In reaching its decision to approve the merger and to recommend such merger
to its stockholders, the board of directors consulted with Cambridge senior
management and with Cambridge's advisors, Salomon Smith Barney and Morgan
Lewis. In reaching its decision, the board considered all of the reasons
described above under "Joint Reasons for the Merger," including the board's
belief that a combined company would be positioned to compete more effectively
in the market, thereby increasing the potential for improved long-term
operating and financial results. The Cambridge board also considered the
following factors which it believes favor approval of the merger:

  . Merger Consideration--The Cambridge board analyzed the market value of
    the Novell common stock to be issued in exchange for each share of
    Cambridge common stock in light of comparable merger transactions.

  . Opinion of Salomon Smith Barney--The Cambridge board considered the
    opinion of Salomon Smith Barney, issued on March 12, 2001 to the
    Cambridge board of directors as to the fairness, from a financial point
    of view, of the exchange ratio to the holders of Cambridge common stock.
    A copy of the Salomon Smith Barney opinion is attached as Annex B hereto.

  . Presentation of Salomon Smith Barney--The Cambridge board considered the
    various financial information, valuation analyses and other factors set
    forth in the presentation by Salomon Smith Barney at the Cambridge board
    meeting on March 12, 2001, including those described below in the section
    entitled "Opinion of Cambridge's financial advisor."

  . Historical Information--The Cambridge board considered historical
    information concerning Novell's and Cambridge's respective businesses,
    financial performance and conditions, operations, technologies,
    management and competitive positions, including public reports concerning
    results of operations during the most recent fiscal year and fiscal
    quarter for each company filed with the Securities and Exchange
    Commission.

  . Market Conditions--The Cambridge board considered current financial
    market conditions, historical market prices, and volatility and trading
    information with respect to Novell common stock and Cambridge common
    stock.

  . Available Alternatives--The Cambridge board considered potential
    transactions with third parties based on inquiries made by Salomon Smith
    Barney at the direction of Cambridge management, as well as Cambridge
    management's view on the potential for other third parties to enter into
    strategic relationships with, or to acquire, Cambridge.

  . Possible Decline in Market Price of Cambridge Shares--The Cambridge board
    considered the possibility that if a transaction with Novell is not
    consummated and Cambridge remained a publicly owned corporation, the
    price that might be received by Cambridge stockholders in the open market
    or in a future transaction might be less than the consideration to be
    received pursuant to the merger.

  . Terms of the Merger Agreement--The Cambridge board considered the terms
    of the merger agreement, including, among others, the circumstances under
    which the Cambridge board may withdraw its recommendation of the merger,
    the Cambridge board's ability to consider a superior acquisition proposal
    and the conditions to closing of the merger.

  . Tax-Deferred Nature of Transaction--The Cambridge board noted that the
    merger is expected to be a tax-deferred transaction.

  . Transaction Accounted for as a Purchase--The Cambridge board noted that
    the merger is expected to be accounted for as a purchase transaction.

  . Trends in the Industry--The Cambridge board considered various trends in
    the information technology industry and the effect of industry
    consolidation on Cambridge's ability to compete effectively in existing
    markets.

  . Board Representation--The Cambridge board considered the fact that the
    merger agreement provides for the appointment of two Cambridge
    representatives to the board of directors of Novell effective upon the
    closing of the merger. The Cambridge board also noted that Jack L.
    Messman, the president and chief executive officer of Cambridge,
    currently serves on the Novell board and would continue to serve on the
    Novell board following the closing.

  . President and Chief Executive Officer--The Cambridge board considered
    Novell's proposal that Jack L. Messman assume the position of president
    and chief executive officer of Novell effective upon the closing of the
    merger.

   Cambridge's board of directors also identified and considered a variety of
potentially negative factors in its deliberations concerning the merger,
including, but not limited to:

  . the possibility that the merger might not be consummated, and the fact
    that under some circumstances Cambridge might be required to pay a
    termination fee to Novell;

  . the potential conflict between the interests of some Cambridge officers
    and directors, including Mr. Messman, and the interests of Cambridge
    stockholders;

  . the effect that the public announcement of the merger might have on
    Cambridge's sales and operating results, Cambridge's ability to attract
    and retain key personnel and the progress of Cambridge's current
    development and marketing projects;

  . the risk that potential benefits sought in the merger might not be fully
    realized, that some of Cambridge's customers may view Novell as their
    competitor and seek to terminate their relationships with Cambridge and
    that the combined company may not be able to retain key personnel;

  . the risk that, following the merger, some customers of Cambridge may view
    Cambridge as incapable of providing disinterested advice regarding
    software solutions;

  . the limitations placed on Cambridge relating to its ability to pursue
    alternative transactions and to conduct its business prior to the
    closing; and

  . the substantial costs to be incurred in connection with the merger,
    including the costs of integrating the businesses and transaction
    expenses arising from the merger.

   After due consideration and discussion, Cambridge's board of directors
decided that these risks were outweighed by the potential benefits of the
merger.

   The foregoing discussion is not exhaustive of all the factors considered by
Cambridge's board. Each member of Cambridge's board may have considered
different factors, and the board did not quantify or otherwise assign relative
weights to factors considered.

   After considering the recommendation of the board of directors with respect
to the merger agreement, you should be aware that some directors and officers
of Cambridge have interests in the merger that are different from, or are in
addition to, the interests of Cambridge stockholders generally. Please see the
section entitled "Interests of Cambridge directors and officers in the merger"
beginning on page 42 of this proxy statement-prospectus.

Factors considered by the Novell board of directors

   The board of directors of Novell considered factors that it believes will
contribute to the success of the combined companies, including the following:

  . enhanced solution selling capabilities;

  . increased pace of Web-based deployments of business processes to
    accelerate revenue growth;

  . expanded customer relationships among senior business managers;

  . closer customer relationships with feedback to gain competitive advantage
    in the development of Net services software products and solutions
    support;

  . accelerated introduction of Novell technology to clients, information
    technology services partners, and other leading independent software
    vendors;

  . increased percentage of revenue derived from services;

  . expanded management expertise around the design and delivery of
    solutions;

  . enhanced ability to support complex solutions in the Internet and
    eBusiness marketplace;

  . increased customer loyalty as a Net Services software vendor with design,
    implementation and maintenance services for business solutions;

  . improved operating margins through elimination of redundant costs in the
    combined entity; and

  . enhanced business model resulting in revenue synergy by combining
    software products with solution services to support the deployment of
    business processes and Web-based applications to the Internet.

   After taking into account these and other factors, the Novell board of
directors unanimously determined that the merger agreement was in the best
interests of Novell and its stockholders and that Novell should enter into the
merger agreement and complete the merger.

Opinion of Cambridge's financial advisor

   On February 7, 2001, Salomon Smith Barney was retained to act as financial
advisor to Cambridge in connection with the merger. Pursuant to Salomon Smith
Barney's engagement letter with Cambridge, Salomon Smith Barney rendered an
opinion to the Cambridge board of directors on March 12, 2001, to the effect
that,

based upon and subject to the considerations and limitations set forth in the
opinion, its work described below and other factors it deemed relevant, as of
that date, the exchange ratio was fair, from a financial point of view, to
holders of Cambridge common stock.

   The full text of Salomon Smith Barney's opinion, which sets forth the
assumptions made, general procedures followed, matters considered and limits on
the review undertaken, is included as Annex B to this document. The summary of
Salomon Smith Barney's opinion set forth below is qualified in its entirety by
reference to the full text of the opinion. Stockholders are urged to read
Salomon Smith Barney's opinion carefully and in its entirety.

   In arriving at its opinion, Salomon Smith Barney reviewed a draft of the
merger agreement, dated March 10, 2001, and held discussions with certain
senior officers and other representatives and advisors of each of Cambridge and
Novell concerning the businesses, operations and prospects of Cambridge and
Novell. Salomon Smith Barney examined certain publicly available business and
financial information relating to Cambridge and Novell. Salomon Smith Barney
reviewed the financial terms of the merger as set forth in the merger agreement
in relation to, among other things, current and historical market prices and
trading volumes of Cambridge common stock and Novell common stock, the
historical and projected earnings and other operating data of Cambridge and
Novell, and the historical and projected capitalization and financial condition
of Cambridge and Novell. Salomon Smith Barney considered, to the extent
publicly available, the financial terms of certain other similar transactions
recently effected which Salomon Smith Barney considered relevant in evaluating
the merger and analyzed certain financial, stock market and other publicly
available information relating to the businesses of other companies whose
operations Salomon Smith Barney considered relevant in evaluating those of
Cambridge and Novell. In addition to the foregoing, Salomon Smith Barney
conducted such other analyses and examinations and considered such other
information and financial, economic and market criteria as Salomon Smith Barney
deemed appropriate in arriving at its opinion.

   In rendering its opinion, Salomon Smith Barney assumed and relied, without
independent verification, upon the accuracy and completeness of all financial
and other information and data publicly available or
furnished to or otherwise reviewed by or discussed with it. With respect to
financial forecasts and other information and data provided to or otherwise
reviewed by or discussed with Salomon Smith Barney, Salomon Smith Barney was
advised by the managements of Cambridge and Novell that such forecasts and
other information and data had been reasonably prepared on bases reflecting the
best currently available estimates and judgments of Cambridge and Novell
management as to the future financial performance of Cambridge and Novell.
Salomon Smith Barney expressed no view with respect to such forecasts and other
information and data or the assumptions on which they were based. Salomon Smith
Barney assumed, with the consent of the Cambridge board of directors, that the
merger will be treated as a tax-free reorganization for United States federal
income purposes. Salomon Smith Barney did not make and was not provided with an
independent evaluation or appraisal of the assets or liabilities (contingent or
otherwise) of Cambridge or Novell, nor did it make any physical inspection of
the properties or assets of Cambridge or Novell. Cambridge advised Salomon
Smith Barney, and Salomon Smith Barney assumed, that the final terms of the
merger agreement would not vary materially from those set forth in the draft
reviewed by it. Salomon Smith Barney further assumed that the merger would be
consummated in accordance with the terms of the merger agreement without waiver
of any of the conditions precedent to the merger contained in the merger
agreement.

   Salomon Smith Barney did not express any opinion as to what the value of the
Novell common stock actually will be when issued in the merger or the price at
which Novell common stock will trade subsequent to the merger. Salomon Smith
Barney was not requested to consider, and its opinion did not address, the
relative merits of the merger as compared to any alternative business
strategies that might exist for Cambridge or the effect of any other
transaction in which Cambridge might engage. Salomon Smith Barney's opinion
necessarily was based on information available to it and financial, stock
market and other conditions and circumstances existing and disclosed to it as
of the date of its opinion.

   Salomon Smith Barney's advisory services and opinion were provided for the
information of Cambridge's board of directors in its evaluation of the proposed
merger and does not constitute a recommendation of the merger to Cambridge or
its stockholders, nor does it constitute a recommendation to any stockholder as
to how such stockholder should vote on any matter relating to the merger.

   In connection with rendering its opinion, Salomon Smith Barney made
presentations to the Cambridge board of directors on March 9, 2001 and March
12, 2001, with respect to the material analyses performed by Salomon Smith
Barney in evaluating the fairness of the exchange ratio. The following is a
summary of that presentation. The summary includes information presented in
tabular format. In order to understand fully the financial analyses used by
Salomon Smith Barney, these tables must be read together with the text of each
summary. The tables alone do not constitute a complete description of the
financial analyses. The following quantitative information, to the extent it is
based on market data, is, except as otherwise indicated, based on market data
as it existed at or prior to March 9, 2001, and is not necessarily indicative
of current or future market conditions.

   Comparable companies analyses.

   Salomon Smith Barney compared financial, operating and stock market
information for each of Cambridge and Novell, with the same information for
selected publicly traded companies that operate in the same sectors as each of
Cambridge and Novell. For Cambridge, Salomon Smith Barney selected the
following comparable companies operating in the systems integrators sector:

  . CIBER Inc.;

  . Computer Horizons Corp.;

  . Covansys;

  . iGate Capital Corporation;

  . IMRglobal Corp.;

  . marchFIRST, Inc.; and

  . Modis Professional Services, Inc.

Given Novell's mix of products and services, Salomon Smith Barney selected
comparable companies operating in the following three sectors, each of which is
comparable to one of the three major divisions of Novell's operations:

  . content-delivery products;

  . information technology services; and

  . software.

   The following table sets forth the comparable companies selected by Salomon
Smith Barney in each of those sectors:

      Content-
      Delivery
      Products     IT Services              Software
      --------     -----------              --------

   CACHEFLOW Inc.  INFORTE CORP.            Remedy Corporation
   Digital
    Island, Inc.   Predictive Systems, Inc. J.D. Edwards & Co.
   INKTOMI
    CORPORATION    Sapient Corporation      Computer Associates International, Inc.

   The forecasted financial information used by Salomon Smith Barney in the
course of its comparable companies analyses was based on research published by
certain investment banks as well as information

published by First Call Corporation. First Call Corporation compiles summaries
of financial forecasts published by various investment banking firms.
Calculations were made based on the closing price per share of each company's
common stock on March 9, 2001. In deriving ratios for the selected comparable
companies, Salomon Smith Barney made certain adjustments to the relevant data
to take into account certain unusual and nonrecurring items. In each instance,
firm value was calculated as the sum of:

  . equity value (common shares on a fully diluted basis valued at the
    closing price per share on March 9, 2001, less any proceeds that would be
    received from the exercise of options or conversion of securities); plus

  . non-convertible indebtedness; plus

  . minority interests in subsidiaries; plus

  . non-convertible preferred stock; plus

  . all out-of-the-money convertible securities; minus

  . investments in unconsolidated affiliates and cash.

   For Novell and the selected comparable companies operating in the content-
delivery products, information technology services and software sectors,
Salomon Smith Barney derived and compared, among other things:

  . the equity value of each company as of March 9, 2001;

  . the firm value of each company as of March 9, 2001;

  . the ratio of the closing price per common share of each company on March
    9, 2001, to (a) its estimated earnings per share (EPS) for 2000, and (b)
    its estimated EPS for 2001;

  . the estimated revenue growth rate of each company for 2001;

  . the five year estimated EPS growth rate of each company; and

  . the ratio of each company's firm value to (a) its estimated revenue for
    2000, and (b) its estimated revenue for 2001.

   The following tables sets forth the results of these analyses for each of
the three sectors selected by Salomon Smith Barney:

   Based on these data, Salomon Smith Barney derived the following ranges for
the implied firm value of each of Novell's three major divisions as a multiple
of estimated 2001 revenues (i) 0.9x to 1.4x for Novell's Net Directory Services
operations which Salomon Smith Barney considered comparable to the selected
software companies, (ii) 0.8x to 1.2x for Novell's Content Services operations
which Salomon Smith Barney considered comparable to the selected content-
delivery products companies, and (iii) 0.3x to 0.5x for Novell's Customer
Services operations which Salomon Smith Barney considered comparable to the
selected information technology companies. Using estimates of 2001 revenue for
each of Novell's three major divisions based on information research published
by certain investment banks as well as Novell management estimates, Salomon
Smith Barney derived a range for Novell's implied firm value of $2,019 million
to $2,493 million and a range for the implied equity value per share of Novell
common stock of $6.27 to $7.75. Using the range derived for the implied equity
value per share of Novell common stock and the exchange ratio in the merger of
0.668, Salomon Smith Barney further derived a range of the implied price per
share of Cambridge common stock in the merger of $4.19 to $5.18.

   For Cambridge and the selected comparable companies operating in the systems
integrators sector, Salomon Smith Barney derived and compared, among other
things:

  . the equity value of each company as of March 9, 2001;

  . the ratio of the closing price per common share of each company on March
    9, 2001, to its estimated EPS for 2000, and its estimated EPS for 2001;

  . the five year estimated EPS growth rate of each company;

  . the firm value of each company as of March 9, 2001;

  . the ratio of each company's firm value to its revenue for the twelve-
    month period ended September 30, 2000, its estimated revenue for 2000,
    and its estimated revenue for 2001; and

  . each company's twelve month margins for the period ended September 30,
    2000, including gross profits, and earnings before interest expense,
    taxes, depreciation and amortization ("EBITDA").

   Based on these data, Salomon Smith Barney derived the following ranges for
Cambridge's implied firm value as a multiple of estimated revenue: (i) 0.4x to
0.5x estimated 2000 revenue and (ii) 0.3x to 0.4x estimated 2001 revenue. Using
estimates of 2000 revenue and 2001 revenue based on information contained in
Salomon Smith Barney research reports, Salomon Smith Barney derived a range for
Cambridge's implied firm value of $190 million to $230 million, and a range for
the implied equity value per share of Cambridge common stock of $2.90 to $3.50.
Salomon Smith Barney noted that the lower limit of the range derived for the
implied price per share of Cambridge common stock in the merger ($4.19 to
$5.18, as described above) was above the upper limit of the range derived for
the implied equity value per share of Cambridge common stock using the
comparable companies analysis. Salomon Smith Barney also derived a range of
$3.50 to $4.80 for the implied equity value per share of Cambridge common stock
based upon an assumed control premium of approximately 25% to 35% over the
equity value per share of Cambridge common stock implied by the comparable
companies analysis. Salomon Smith Barney noted that the range of the implied
price per share of Cambridge common stock in the merger of $4.19 to $5.18 was
within or above this range.

   Precedent transaction and premium analyses.

   Salomon Smith Barney reviewed publicly available information for the
following eight acquisition transactions involving public companies in the
information technology services sector:

   Announcement Date   Acquiror                      Acquired Company
   -----------------   --------                      ----------------

   February 21, 2001   CGI Group Inc.                IMRglobal Corp.
   January 13, 2001    Carlyle Group Inc.            Ssangyoung Information and
                                                      Communications
   December 14, 2000   Francisco Partners, L.P.      marchFIRST, Inc.
   October 27, 2000    Silverline Technologies, LTD. SeraNova Inc.
   October 16, 2000    Schlumberger Technology       Convergent Group Corp.
                        Corporation
   June 20, 2000       Commerce One Inc.             AppNet Inc.
   March 22, 2000      PSINet, Inc.                  Metamor Worldwide
   December 29, 1999   Leapnet Inc.                  SPR Inc.

   For each precedent transaction, Salomon Smith Barney derived:

  . the premium based on the consideration paid or proposed to be paid in the
    transaction over the firm value of the acquired company (a) one day prior
    to announcement of the transaction, and (b) 60 days prior to announcement
    of the transaction; and

  . the ratio of the firm value of the acquired company based on the
    consideration paid or proposed to be paid in the transaction to the (a)
    revenue of the acquired company, (b) estimated earning before interest
    expenses and taxes (EBIT) of the acquired company, and (c) EBITDA of the
    acquired company, in each case, for the last twelve-month period ending
    prior to the announcement of the transaction for which financial results
    were available.

   With respect to the financial information for the companies involved in the
precedent transactions, Salomon Smith Barney relied on information provided by
Securities Data Corporation as well as information available in public
documents. Securities Data Corporation compiles summaries of merger and
financing information published by certain investment banks, market research
firms and trade associations. In evaluating the data for the precedent
transactions, Salomon Smith Barney took into consideration changes in market
conditions that have occurred since the time certain precedent transactions
were announced. Salomon Smith Barney also noted that most of the precedent
transactions involved target companies that, unlike Cambridge, had positive
EBITDA for the twelve-month period prior to the announcement of the
transaction. The following table sets forth the results of these analyses:

                                                        Range     Median  Mean
                                                        -----     ------  -----

Premium:
  1-day prior to announcement......................    2.6%-94.3%  27.0%   38.8%
  60-days prior to announcement.................... (82.0)%-97.9%  13.6%    8.6%
Ratio of Firm Value of Acquired Company to:
  Revenue for the 12-month period prior to
   announcement....................................    0.1x-4.8x   1.3x    1.7x
  Estimated EBIT for the 12-month period prior to
   announcement....................................   14.9x-77.2x 46.6x   46.3x
  Estimated EBITDA for the 12-month period prior to
   announcement....................................    7.7x-53.1x  9.3x   25.0x

   Based on these data, Salomon Smith Barney derived a range for Cambridge's
implied firm value as a multiple of revenue for the last twelve-month period
ending prior to the announcement of the transaction of 0.4x to 0.8x. Based on
Cambridge's revenue for the last twelve-month period ending prior to the
announcement of the merger, Salomon Smith Barney derived a range for
Cambridge's implied firm value of $230 million to $470 million, and a range for
the implied equity value per share of Cambridge common stock of $3.50 to $7.20.
Salomon Smith Barney noted that the range of the implied price per share of
Cambridge common stock in the merger ($4.19 to $5.18, as described above) was
within the range derived for the implied equity value per share of Cambridge
common stock using the precedent transactions analysis.

   Salomon Smith Barney also derived the implied premium represented by the
exchange ratio in the merger over the exchange ratio implied by dividing (i)
the closing price per share of Cambridge common stock by the closing price per
share of Novell common stock as of March 9, 2001; (ii) the average of the
closing prices per share of Cambridge common stock by the average of the
closing prices per share of Novell common stock for the 30-day period ended
March 9, 2001; and (iii) the average of the closing prices per share of
Cambridge common stock by the average of the closing prices per share of Novell
common stock for the 60-day period ended March 9, 2001. The following table
sets forth the results of these analyses:

           Period                    Exchange Ratio                       Implied Premium
           ------                    --------------                       ---------------

     As of March 9, 2001                 0.546x                                22.3%
     30-day average                      0.472x                                41.4%
     60-day average                      0.427x                                56.5%

   Salomon Smith Barney noted that these implied premiums are above or in-line
with the median premiums derived for the precedent transactions.

   Accretion/dilution analysis.

   Salomon Smith Barney performed an analysis of the estimated impact of the
merger on Novell's estimated cash EPS for 2001 pro forma for a combination
effected on January 1, 2001. EPS estimates were based on information published
by First Call Corporation. In performing this analysis, Salomon Smith Barney
did not take into account any projected cost-savings or other synergies
anticipated to result from the merger. The following table shows the
accretion/dilution to the estimated 2001 cash EPS of Novell expected to result
from the merger:

     Cambridge stand-alone............................................. $(0.20)
     Novell stand-alone................................................ $ 0.24
     Combined entity pro-forma......................................... $ 0.18
     Accretion/Dilution to Novell...................................... $(0.06)

   Salomon Smith Barney noted that the merger will be dilutive to Novell's cash
EPS in 2001 pro forma for a combination effected on January 1, 2001 unless the
merger results in synergies of at least $37.9 million.

   The preceding discussion is a summary of the material financial analyses
furnished by Salomon Smith Barney to the Cambridge board of directors, but it
does not purport to be a complete description of the analyses performed by
Salomon Smith Barney or of its presentation to the Cambridge board of
directors. The preparation of financial analyses and fairness opinions is a
complex process involving subjective judgments and is not necessarily
susceptible to partial analysis or summary description. Salomon Smith Barney
made no attempt to assign specific weights to particular analyses or factors
considered, but rather made qualitative judgments as to the significance and
relevance of all the analyses and factors considered and determined to give its
fairness opinion as described above. Accordingly, Salomon Smith Barney believes
that its analyses, and the summary set forth above, must be considered as a
whole, and that selecting portions of the analyses and of the factors
considered by Salomon Smith Barney, without considering all of the analyses and
factors, could create a misleading or incomplete view of the processes
underlying the analyses conducted by Salomon Smith Barney and its opinion. With
regard to the comparable companies and precedent transaction analyses
summarized above, Salomon Smith Barney selected comparable public companies and
precedent transactions on the basis of various factors, including size and
similarity of line of business; however, no company utilized in these analyses
is identical to Cambridge or Novell and no precedent transaction is identical
to the merger. As a result, these analyses are not purely mathematical, but
also take into account differences in financial and operating characteristics
of the subject companies and other factors that could affect the transaction or
public trading value of the subject companies to which Cambridge and Novell are
being compared. In its analyses, Salomon Smith Barney made numerous assumptions
with respect to Cambridge, Novell, industry performance, general business,
economic, market and financial conditions and other matters, many of which are
beyond the control of Cambridge and Novell. Any estimates contained in Salomon
Smith Barney's analyses are not necessarily indicative of actual values or
predictive of future results or values, which may be significantly more or less
favorable than those suggested by these analyses. Estimates of values of
companies do not purport to be appraisals or necessarily to reflect the prices
at which companies may actually be sold. Because these estimates are inherently
subject to uncertainty, none of Cambridge, Novell, the Cambridge board of
directors, the Novell board of directors, Salomon Smith Barney or any other
person assumes responsibility if future results or actual values differ
materially from the estimates. Salomon Smith Barney's analyses were prepared
solely as part of Salomon Smith Barney's analysis of the fairness of the
exchange ratio in the merger and were provided to the Cambridge board of
directors in that connection. The opinion of Salomon Smith Barney was only one
of the factors taken into consideration by the Cambridge board of directors in
making its determination to approve the merger agreement and the merger. Please
see the section entitled "Recommendation of, and factors considered by, the
Cambridge board of directors" on page 31 of this proxy statement-prospectus.

   Salomon Smith Barney is an internationally recognized investment banking
firm engaged in, among other things, the valuation of businesses and their
securities in connection with mergers and acquisitions, restructurings,
leveraged buyouts, negotiated underwritings, competitive biddings, secondary
distributions of

listed and unlisted securities, private placements and valuations for estate,
corporate and other purposes. Cambridge selected Salomon Smith Barney to act as
its financial advisor on the basis of Salomon Smith Barney's international
reputation and Salomon Smith Barney's familiarity with Cambridge. Salomon Smith
Barney and its predecessors and affiliates have previously provided and
currently are providing investment banking services to Cambridge unrelated to
the merger, for which Salomon Smith Barney has received and will receive
compensation. In the ordinary course of its business, Salomon Smith Barney and
its affiliates may actively trade or hold the securities of both Cambridge and
Novell for its own account and for the account of customers and, accordingly,
may at any time hold a long or short position in those securities. Salomon
Smith Barney and its affiliates, including Citigroup Inc. and its affiliates,
may maintain relationships with Cambridge and Novell and their respective
affiliates.

   Pursuant to Salomon Smith Barney's engagement letter, Cambridge agreed to
pay Salomon Smith Barney the following fees for its services rendered in
connection with the merger: (i) $1,000,000, that became payable upon delivery
of Salomon Smith Barney's fairness opinion, (ii) a fee based on the aggregate
consideration received by the holders of Cambridge common stock in the
transaction, ranging from .3% to 2.175% of the value of the transaction and
(iii) 10% of any termination, break-up or similar fee, payable upon receipt of
any such fee by Cambridge. Cambridge has also agreed to reimburse Salomon Smith
Barney for its reasonable travel and other out-of-pocket expenses incurred in
connection with its engagement, including the reasonable fees and expenses of
its counsel, and to indemnify Salomon Smith Barney against specific liabilities
and expenses relating to or arising out of its engagement, including
liabilities under the federal securities laws.

Interests of Cambridge directors and officers in the merger

   When considering the recommendation of Cambridge's board of directors, you
should be aware that Cambridge directors and executive officers have interests
in the merger that are different from, or are in addition to, yours. The
Cambridge board of directors was aware of these potential conflicts and
considered them in making their recommendation.

   Jack L. Messman

   Jack L. Messman, the president, chief executive officer and a director of
Cambridge, has entered into an employment agreement with Novell. Mr. Messman's
employment agreement provides for his employment as chief executive officer and
president of Novell.

   Under the terms of his employment agreement, Mr. Messman will be paid a base
salary of $781,981 per year, subject to normal review and periodic adjustments.
Mr. Messman will also be entitled to a bonus of 100% of his base salary if
performance goals are met, and such additional bonus compensation specified by
the board of directors, if the performance goals are exceeded.

   Additionally, Mr. Messman will receive options to purchase a total of
2,408,045 shares of Novell common stock. This option will be granted on July
12, 2001, and will have an exercise price per share equal to the fair market
value of a share of Novell common stock on the date of grant. The portion of
the option to purchase 1,108,045 shares of Novell common stock will vest as to
25% of the shares originally subject to the option on the date of grant, and as
to 6.25% of the shares originally subject to the option each quarter
thereafter, so that this portion of the option will be fully exercisable three
years from the date of grant. The vested portion will not become exercisable
until six months after the date of grant, provided, however, (i) if Mr. Messman
voluntarily terminates employment within six months of the date of grant for a
reason other than a constructive termination, or if he is terminated for cause
within six months of the date of grant, the option will be cancelled in full,
or, (ii) if Mr. Messman terminates employment for any reason other than that
provided in (i), he will be able to exercise the vested portion of his option.
The portion of the option to purchase 1,300,000 shares will vest as to 25% of
the shares originally subject to the option on the first anniversary of the
date of grant, and as to 6.25% of the shares originally subject to the option
each quarter thereafter, so that this portion of the option will be fully
exercisable four years from the date of grant.

   Under the employment agreement, Mr. Messman will also be granted the right
to purchase 715,780 shares of Novell common stock for an aggregate purchase
price of $71,578. The shares of restricted stock will vest as follows: 299,672
shares will vest on the first anniversary of the date on which Novell grants to
Mr. Messman the right to purchase the restricted stock, 66,800 shares will vest
eighteen months from the date on which Novell grants to Mr. Messman the right
to purchase the restricted stock, 174,654 shares will vest two years from the
date on which Novell grants to Mr. Messman the right to purchase the restricted
stock, and 174,654 shares will vest three years from the date on which Novell
grants to Mr. Messman the right to purchase the restricted stock.

   Pursuant to Mr. Messman's employment agreement, Mr. Messman will be entitled
to receive employee benefits made available to other employees and officers of
Novell and their eligible dependents. Novell will also maintain long-term
disability insurance, short-term disability insurance, term life insurance
coverage, accidental death and dismemberment coverage, and business travel
accident insurance for the benefit of Mr. Messman.

   Under the terms of his employment agreement, in the event Mr. Messman is
terminated without cause or if he is constructively terminated, Mr. Messman
will receive the following benefits:

  .  A severance payment equal to one and a half times Mr. Messman's annual
     salary and target bonus;

  .  A pro rated bonus based on his actual accomplishments for the portion of
     the year he was employed by Novell;

  .  Continued medical, dental, vision and life insurance and other
     applicable welfare benefits for himself and his eligible dependents for
     18 months following his termination;

  .  Acceleration of the vesting of the exercisability of his outstanding
     options that would have become vested and exercisable within the one
     year period after his termination of employment, and all options will
     remain exercisable for the shorter of (i) six months from his last date
     of employment with Novell, or (ii) the original term of the option; and

  .  Lapse of restrictions on any outstanding restricted stock he holds that
     would have lapsed within the one year period after his termination of
     employment.

   In addition, if Novell experiences a change-in-control and Mr. Messman is
terminated without cause or if he is constructively terminated, Mr. Messman
will receive the following benefits:

  .  A severance payment equal to three times Mr. Messman's annual salary and
     target bonus;

  .  A pro rated bonus based on his actual accomplishments for the portion of
     the year he was employed by Novell;

  .  Continued medical, dental, vision and life insurance and other
     applicable welfare benefits for himself and his eligible dependents for
     three years following his termination;

  .  Full acceleration of the vesting of the exercisability of his
     outstanding options, and all options will remain exercisable for the
     shorter of (i) 39 months from his last date of employment with Novell,
     or (ii) the original term of the option;

  .  The lapse of restrictions on all outstanding restricted stock held by
     Messman;

  .  Novell will pay for the costs of attorney's fees on behalf of Mr.
     Messman in the event of a dispute regarding Mr. Messman's change-in-
     control benefits; and

  .  In the event that any payments or benefits Mr. Messman receives from
     Novell are subject to excise tax under Section 280G of the Internal
     Revenue Code, Novell will pay Mr. Messman an additional amount so that
     the net amount retained by Mr. Messman after deduction of (i) any excise
     tax and (ii) any federal, state and local tax and excise tax imposed
     upon the additional amount, shall be equal to the value of such payments
     or benefits.

   Other key executives and directors

   Most Cambridge executive officers are to receive equity grants and employee
benefits in connection with their employment with Novell after the completion
of the merger. These executives will be employed by Novell in comparable
positions and at base salaries and incentive compensation that are at least
equal to the cash base salaries and incentive compensation that they currently
receive, or are eligible to receive, from Cambridge. These Cambridge executive
officers will also participate in the Novell Senior Management Severance Plan.

   As a condition to obtaining employment with, and other benefits from, Novell
effective at the closing, most Cambridge executives have waived, or are
expected to waive, the provisions of their existing severance agreements with
Cambridge which would be triggered by the consummation of the merger.

   Some Cambridge executives are not expected to waive the provisions of their
existing severance agreements. These executives are entitled to severance
payments aggregating approximately $5.2 million under their Cambridge severance
agreements. In addition, these executives will receive stock option grants from
Novell for an aggregate of approximately 351,000 shares following the merger.

   Each Cambridge director that assumes initial membership on the Novell board
of directors after the completion of the merger will receive an option grant to
purchase 30,000 shares of Novell common stock under the Novell Stock Option
Plan for Non-Employee Directors, providing for the automatic grant of stock
options to each person that first becomes an outside director on the Novell
board of directors.

   In addition, Cambridge's directors and officers will receive, for a period
of six years after the completion of the merger, directors and officers
insurance coverage with terms substantially the same as those of Cambridge's
existing directors and officers insurance policy for events occurring on or
prior to the completion of the merger through one of the following mechanisms:

  .  a directors and officers insurance policy whose annual premium is not
     greater than 150% of the premium of Cambridge's policy in effect on the
     date of the merger agreement, or

  .  obtaining six-year "tail" coverage under Cambridge's existing directors
     and officers insurance policy.

   Cambridge nominated directors

   In addition, John W. Poduska, Sr. and James D. Robinson, III, two Cambridge
directors selected by Cambridge, will become directors of Novell's board of
directors effective upon consummation of the merger. Information regarding Mr.
Poduska and Mr. Robinson is available in Cambridge's Annual Report on Form 10-K
for fiscal year 2000 which is incorporated herein by reference.

Equity grants and employee benefits after completion of the merger for
Cambridge employees

   Cambridge Options

   All Cambridge options will be cancelled as of the date of the merger
pursuant to the agreement between Cambridge and each option holder.

   Nonexecutive Option Grants

   The Novell compensation committee has approved the grant of nonqualified
stock options to purchase Novell common stock to each Cambridge nonexecutive
who is employed by Cambridge on the closing date and whose Cambridge options
were cancelled as a result of the merger, which grants shall be made on July
12, 2001 or, in some instances involving the termination of such nonexecutives,
on a prior date. The aggregate number of shares subject to these options will
be approximately 4,000,000 shares. The exercise price of the

nonexecutive options will be at the fair market value of Novell common stock on
the date of grant. These grants generally may not be exercised for a period of
six months following the date of grant.

   The nonexecutive options will have the following terms:

  .  25% of the options will vest on the date of grant and the remaining
     portion will vest quarterly over the next three years from the date of
     grant;

  .  the term of the options will be ten years from the date of grant; and

  .  all other terms of the nonexecutive options will be as set forth in
     Novell's standard option agreements for grants under the Novell stock
     plans.

   In addition to the above option grants, Novell may grant options to purchase
Novell common stock to continuing Cambridge nonexecutives who did not have
Cambridge options at the time of the merger. These additional grants may
increase aggregate option grants to nonexecutives to approximately 7,000,000
shares of Novell common stock.

   Executive Option Grants

   Pursuant to his employment agreement, Mr. Messman will receive options to
purchase 2,408,045 shares of Novell common stock. The options will be granted
on July 12, 2001 and will have an exercise price equal to the fair market value
of Novell common stock on the date of grant. The options will become vested and
exercisable as described under "Interests of Cambridge directors and officers
in the merger--Jack L. Messman" on page 42 of this proxy statement-prospectus.

   In addition to the options to be granted to Mr. Messman, the Novell
compensation committee has approved the grant of nonqualified stock options to
purchase Novell common stock to each Cambridge executive officer who is
employed by Cambridge on the closing date and who has waived his rights under
his severance agreement with Cambridge. Such grants shall be made on July 12,
2001, or, in certain instances involving the resignation or termination of such
executive officers, the grants will be made on a prior date. The aggregate
number of shares subject to the executive options will equal approximately
1,750,000. The exercise price of the executive options will be the fair market
value of Novell common stock on the date of option grant. These options
generally may not be exercised for a period of six months following the date of
grant.

   The executive options will have the following terms:

  .  25% of the options will vest on the date of grant and the remaining
     portion will vest quarterly over the next three years from the date of
     grant;

  .  the term of the options will be ten years from the date of grant; and

  .  all other terms of the executive options will be as set forth in
     Novell's standard option agreements for grants under the Novell stock
     option plans.

   The Novell compensation committee also has approved, effective on July 12,
2001, or the last day of employment, whichever is earlier, option grants to
purchase Novell common stock to Cambridge executives who are not expected to
waive their rights to severance benefits under their severance agreements with
Cambridge. The aggregate number of shares subject to these options will equal
approximately 351,000 shares. The exercise price per share will be based on the
exchange ratio set forth in the merger agreement and the exercise price per
share under the executive's cancelled options to purchase Cambridge common
stock. These options will be fully vested and exercisable on the date of grant,
the options will remain exercisable under the terms set forth in the
individual's severance agreement with Cambridge, and be subject to all other
terms as set forth in Novell's standard option agreements for grants under the
Novell stock option plans. There may be compensation expense for financial
accounting purposes recognized as a result of these grants.

   Restricted Stock Grant to Executives

   Pursuant to his employment agreement, Mr. Messman will be granted the right
to purchase 715,780 shares of restricted stock for an aggregate purchase price
of $71,578. The shares of restricted stock will vest as follows: 299,672 shares
will vest on the first anniversary of the date on which Novell grants to Mr.
Messman the right to purchase the restricted stock, 66,800 shares will vest 18
months from the date on which Novell grants to Mr. Messman the right to
purchase the restricted stock, 174,654 shares will vest two years from the date
on which Novell grants to Mr. Messman the right to purchase the restricted
stock, and 174,654 shares will vest three years from the date on which Novell
grants to Mr. Messman the right to purchase the restricted stock.

   In addition to the grant of restricted stock to Mr. Messman, the Novell
compensation committee approved the grant of restricted stock purchase awards
to some Cambridge executives aggregating approximately 405,000 shares on July
12, 2001, or in some instances involving the resignation or termination of such
executive officers, on a prior date. The restricted stock will have the
following terms:

  .  40% of the shares will vest on the first anniversary of the grant date,
     and the remaining portion will vest on the second and third
     anniversaries of the grant date in 30% increments;

  .  the purchase price shall be $0.10 per share; and

  .  all other terms of the restricted stock will be as set forth in Novell's
     standard restricted stock agreement for grants under the Novell stock
     option plans. Compensation expense will be recognized for financial
     accounting purposes as a result of these issuances.

   Severance Benefits

   The Novell compensation committee has approved the immediate participation
of most Cambridge executives in the Novell severance plan upon the completion
of the merger. These Cambridge executives will receive severance benefits under
the Novell severance plan in the event of a termination in connection with a
change-in-control or a termination for other reasons. Further, in the event of
a termination of the Cambridge executive for a reason other than due to a
voluntary resignation or termination for cause, all options and restricted
stock held by the Cambridge executive will be subject to additional vesting as
provided under the severance plan.

   The Novell compensation committee also has approved the immediate
participation following the merger of Cambridge nonexecutives who do not have a
severance agreement with Cambridge in Novell's limited severance plan or policy
in the event such individual's employment is terminated after the completion of
the merger. In addition, the Novell compensation committee has agreed to assume
any severance agreements Cambridge nonexecutives had with Cambridge prior to
the completion of the merger.

   Cambridge 401(k) Plan

   The Novell compensation committee has determined that the Cambridge
Technology Partners 401(k) Plan will continue for the benefit of all eligible
Cambridge employees.

   Cambridge Health and Welfare Plans

   The Novell compensation committee has determined that the Cambridge health
and welfare plans will continue for the benefit of all eligible Cambridge
employees until December 31, 2001, and effective January 1, 2002, all eligible
Cambridge employees will participate in the Novell health and welfare plans
effective January 1, 2002.

Exchange of Cambridge stock certificates for Novell stock certificates

   When the merger is completed, the exchange agent will mail to you a letter
of transmittal and instructions for surrendering your Cambridge stock
certificates in exchange for Novell stock certificates. When you deliver your
Cambridge stock certificates to the exchange agent along with an executed
letter of transmittal and any other required documents, your Cambridge stock
certificates will be canceled and you will receive Novell stock certificates
representing the number of full shares of Novell common stock to which you are
entitled under the merger agreement. You will not receive any fractional shares
of Novell common stock in the merger, but will instead receive cash equal to
your proportionate interest of the net proceeds from the sale of the aggregate
fractional shares on the Nasdaq National Market by the exchange agent on your
behalf of the aggregate fractional shares. Alternatively, Novell may, at its
election, have the exchange agent pay you cash equal to the market value of the
fractional shares. In this case, the market value of the fractional shares
would be based on the average closing price of Novell common stock for the five
trading days ending on the trading day immediately prior to the closing of the
merger.

You should not submit your Cambridge stock certificates for exchange until you
receive your instructions and a form of letter of transmittal from the exchange
agent

   You are not entitled to receive any dividends or other distributions on
Novell common stock until the merger is completed and you have surrendered your
Cambridge stock certificates in exchange for Novell stock certificates. Subject
to the effect of applicable laws, you will receive payment for any dividend or
other distribution on Novell common stock with a record date after the merger
and a payment date prior to the date you surrender your Cambridge stock
certificates promptly after your Novell stock certificates are issued. You will
receive payment for any dividend or other distribution on Novell common stock
with a record date after the merger and a payment date after the date you
surrender your Cambridge stock certificates promptly after the payment date.

   Novell will only issue you a Novell stock certificate and/or a check in lieu
of a fractional share in a name other than the name in which a surrendered
Cambridge stock certificate is registered if you present the exchange agent
with all documents required to show and effect the unrecorded transfer of
ownership and show that you paid any applicable stock transfer taxes. If your
Cambridge stock certificate has been lost, stolen or destroyed, you may need to
deliver an affidavit and bond prior to receiving your Novell stock certificate.

Material U.S. federal income tax consequences of the merger

   The following are the material U.S. federal income tax consequences of the
merger to holders of Cambridge common stock who, pursuant to the merger,
exchange their Cambridge common stock for Novell common stock, assuming that
the merger is effected as described in the merger agreement and in this proxy
statement-prospectus. This discussion is based on existing provisions of the
Internal Revenue Code, existing and proposed Treasury regulations, and current
administrative rulings and court decisions, all of which are subject to change,
possibly with retroactive effect. This discussion is also based on and subject
to certain assumptions, limitations, representations and covenants, including
those contained in certificates of officers of Novell, Cambridge, and Ceres
Neptune Acquisition Corp.

   This discussion does not address all U.S. federal income tax considerations
that may be relevant to you in light of your particular circumstances. Factors
that could alter the tax consequences of the merger to you include:

  . if you are a dealer or trader in securities;

  . if you are subject to the alternative minimum tax provisions of the
    Internal Revenue Code;

  . if you are not a U.S. citizen or resident;

  . if you are a tax-exempt organization, financial institution or insurance
    company;

  . if you acquired your shares in connection with stock option or stock
    purchase plans or in other compensatory transactions; or

  . if you hold Cambridge common stock as part of a hedge, straddle, or other
    integrated, risk reduction, constructive sale, or conversion transaction.

   This discussion does not address the tax consequences of an exchange of
options or warrants for Cambridge common stock into options or warrants for
Novell common stock. This discussion assumes you hold your shares of Cambridge
common stock as capital assets within the meaning of Section 1221 of the
Internal Revenue Code.

   Novell's and Cambridge's obligations to complete the merger are conditioned
upon Novell's receipt of an opinion dated as of the closing of the merger from
Wilson Sonsini and Cambridge's receipt of an opinion dated as of the closing of
the merger from Morgan Lewis, that the merger will constitute a reorganization
within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code. These
opinions will be based upon then-existing law and will rely on certain facts,
assumptions, limitations, representations and covenants including those
contained in certificates executed by officers of Novell, Cambridge and Ceres
Neptune Acquisition Corp. that, if incorrect in certain material respects,
would jeopardize the conclusions reached by Wilson Sonsini and Morgan Lewis in
their opinions. The tax opinions will not bind the Internal Revenue Service or
the courts or prevent the Internal Revenue Service from successfully asserting
a contrary opinion. Neither Novell nor Cambridge will request a ruling from the
Internal Revenue Service in connection with the merger.

   The following material federal income tax consequences will result from the
merger's qualification as a reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a)
of the Internal Revenue Code:

  . You will not recognize any gain or loss upon your receipt of Novell
    common stock in the merger, except with respect to cash received instead
    of a fractional share of Novell common stock.

  . The aggregate tax basis of the Novell common stock received by you as a
    result of the merger (treating fractional share interests in Novell
    common stock as having been issued in the merger and then redeemed for
    cash) will be the same as the aggregate tax basis of the Cambridge common
    stock you surrender in the merger.

  . The holding period of the Novell common stock received by you in the
    merger will include the period during which you held the Cambridge common
    stock exchanged therefor.

  . None of Novell, Ceres Neptune Acquisition Corp., or Cambridge will
    recognize gain or loss solely as a result of the merger.

   If you receive cash in the merger instead of a fractional share interest in
Novell common stock, you will be treated as having received the cash in
redemption of the fractional share interest. Assuming that, immediately after
the merger, you hold a minimal interest in Novell, you exercise no control over
Novell and, as a result of the deemed redemption and after giving effect to
certain constructive ownership rules, you experience an actual reduction in
your interest in Novell, you will recognize capital gain or loss on the deemed
redemption in an amount equal to the difference between the amount of cash
received and your adjusted tax basis allocable to such fractional share.
Otherwise, the cash payment may be taxable to you as a dividend. Any such
capital gain or loss will be long-term capital gain or loss if your holding
period for your Cambridge common stock is greater than 12 months at the time of
the merger.

   If the Internal Revenue Service were to successfully challenge the status of
the merger as a reorganization, the tax consequences to you described above
would not, in general, apply. In such event, you would be required to recognize
gain or loss as a result of the merger in an amount equal to the difference
between your basis in your Cambridge common stock and the fair market value, as
of the closing of the merger, of the shares of Novell common stock and any
other consideration that you receive.

   Even if the merger qualifies as a reorganization, you could recognize gain
to the extent that shares of Novell common stock are considered to be received
in exchange for services or property, other than solely for Cambridge common
stock. All or a portion of such gain may be taxable as ordinary income. You may
also recognize gain to the extent that you are treated as receiving, directly
or indirectly, consideration other than Novell common stock in exchange for
your Cambridge common stock.

   The foregoing discussion is not intended to be a complete analysis or
description of all potential United States federal income tax consequences of
the merger. In particular, the discussion does not address tax consequences
which may vary with your individual circumstances. Moreover, the discussion
does not address any non-income tax or any foreign, state or local tax
consequences of the merger. Accordingly, we strongly urge you to consult your
own tax advisor as to the specific United States federal, state, local or
foreign income or other tax consequences of the merger to you.

Accounting treatment of the merger

   Novell intends to account for the merger as a purchase transaction.

Regulatory filings and approvals required to complete the merger

   The merger is subject to the requirements of the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust
Improvements Act of 1976, as amended. Novell and Cambridge have made the
required filings with the Department of Justice and the United States Federal
Trade Commission, and the applicable waiting period has been terminated.

   The Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice or the United States
Federal Trade Commission may challenge the merger on antitrust grounds after
termination of the waiting period. Accordingly, at any time before or after the
completion of the merger, either the Antitrust Division of the Department of
Justice or the United States Federal Trade Commission could take action under
the antitrust laws as it deems necessary or desirable in the public interest.
Other persons could also take action under the antitrust laws, including action
seeking to enjoin the merger. Additionally, at any time before or after the
completion of the merger, whether or not the applicable waiting period expired
or ended, any state could take action under the antitrust laws as it deems
necessary or desirable in the public interest. There can be no assurance that a
challenge to the merger will not be made or that, if a challenge is made, we
will prevail.

   The German Competition Authority has been notified of the merger and has
cleared the transaction. A short-form notification has been submitted in
Ireland requesting that the Irish antitrust authorities confirm that Ireland
does not have jurisdiction over this transaction. The Irish Department of
Enterprise, Trade and Employment confirmed by letter that the proposed
transaction is not notifiable under the Irish Mergers Act. The companies have
made competition filings in Brazil and the Netherlands. Under the laws of
Brazil, the merger can be consummated without prior approval from the Brazilian
authorities. Under the laws of the Netherlands, the merger cannot be
consummated without prior approval from the Dutch authorities.

   Other than as described above, neither Novell nor Cambridge is aware of any
other material governmental or regulatory approval required for completion of
the merger, other than the effectiveness of this registration statement of
which this proxy statement-prospectus forms a part and compliance with
applicable corporate laws of Delaware.

Restrictions on sales of shares by affiliates of Cambridge and Novell

   The shares of Novell common stock to be issued in connection with the merger
will be registered under the Securities Act and will be freely transferable
under the Securities Act, except for shares of Novell common stock issued to
any person who is deemed to be an "affiliate" of either Novell or Cambridge.
Persons who may be deemed affiliates include individuals or entities that
control, are controlled by, or are under common control with such other person
and may include some of our executive officers and directors, as well as our
respective

principal stockholders. Affiliates may not sell their shares of Novell common
stock acquired in connection with the merger except pursuant to:

  . an effective registration statement under the Securities Act covering the
    resale of those shares;

  . an exemption under paragraph (d) of Rule 145 under the Securities Act; or

  . any other applicable exemption under the Securities Act.

   Novell's registration statement on Form S-4, of which this proxy statement-
prospectus forms a part, does not cover the resale of shares of Novell common
stock to be received by Novell and Cambridge affiliates in the merger.

Listing on the Nasdaq National Market of Novell common stock to be issued in
the merger

   Novell will have the shares of Novell common stock to be issued in the

The Merger

   At the closing of the merger, Ceres Neptune Acquisition Corp., a wholly
owned subsidiary of Novell, will merge with and into Cambridge. As a result of
the merger, Cambridge will become a wholly owned subsidiary of Novell.

   Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws of Cambridge After the Merger

   At the closing of the merger, the certificate of incorporation and the
bylaws of Ceres Neptune Acquisition Corp. will become the certificate of
incorporation and the bylaws of the surviving corporation. The certificate of
incorporation of the surviving corporation shall be amended so that the name of
the surviving corporation shall be Cambridge Technology Partners, Inc.

   Directors and Officers of Cambridge After the Merger

   At the closing of the merger, the directors of Ceres Neptune Acquisition
Corp. will be the directors of the surviving corporation, and the officers of
Cambridge will be the officers of the surviving corporation.

   Effect of Merger on Capital Stock of Cambridge

   At the closing of the merger, each share of common stock of Cambridge issued
and outstanding immediately prior to the merger will be cancelled and
extinguished and automatically converted into the right to receive 0.668 of a
share of Novell common stock, subject to adjustments for stock splits and
similar matters. No fractional shares of Novell common stock will be issued in
the merger. Instead, each holder of fractional shares will receive an amount of
cash equal to such holder's proportionate interest in the net proceeds from the
sale by the exchange agent in one or more transactions on behalf of all holders
of fractional shares of Novell. All unexercised options to acquire Cambridge
common stock will be cancelled upon the closing of the merger. For a
description of equity grants to be made to Cambridge employees following the
merger, see the discussion on pages 44 through 46 of this proxy statement-
prospectus.

   The merger agreement requires Novell, as of the closing of the merger, to
deposit with Novell's selected exchange agent, for the benefit of holders of
shares of Cambridge common stock, certificates representing the shares of
Novell common stock to be issued in the merger. When the merger is completed,
the exchange agent will mail to you a letter of transmittal and instructions
for surrendering your Cambridge stock certificates in exchange for Novell stock
certificates, cash in lieu of fractional shares and any dividends or
distributions that may be issuable.

Regulatory filings

   The merger agreement contains various covenants and agreements regarding
preparation of regulatory filings that are customary in transactions of this
nature, including:

  . Novell and Cambridge have agreed to prepare and cause to be filed with
    the Securities and Exchange Commission a registration statement on Form
    S-4, including this proxy statement-prospectus, and to cooperate and
    promptly provide information to each other as required or appropriate for
    inclusion in the registration statement;

  . Novell and Cambridge have agreed to respond to any comments of the staff
    of the Securities and Exchange Commission and to use commercially
    reasonable efforts to have the registration statement on Form S-4
    declared effective under the Securities Act as promptly as practicable
    after it is filed;

    S-4 is declared effective;

  . Novell and Cambridge have agreed to prepare and file any other filings
    relating to the merger required to be filed under applicable law;

  . Cambridge has agreed to cause this proxy statement-prospectus to include
    the recommendation of its board of directors in favor of adoption and
    approval of the merger agreement and approval of the merger, subject to
    specified exceptions.

Special meeting of Cambridge stockholders

   Cambridge has agreed to convene a special meeting of Cambridge stockholders
as promptly as practicable after the registration statement on Form S-4 is
declared effective, and, unless Cambridge's board of directors has withdrawn
its recommendation of the merger agreement and the merger, to use its
commercially reasonable efforts to solicit and secure from its stockholders at
the meeting the adoption and approval of the merger agreement and the merger.
Cambridge has also agreed that its board of directors will recommend that its
stockholders vote in favor of and adopt and approve the merger agreement and
the merger, and that this recommendation will not be withdrawn or modified in a
manner adverse to Novell, subject to specified exceptions.

   Nothing in the merger agreement prevents the Cambridge board of directors
from withdrawing or changing its recommendation in favor of the merger if the
board reasonably concludes in good faith, after consultation with its outside
counsel, that the failure to so withdraw or change its recommendation would be
inconsistent with its fiduciary obligations.

Non-solicitation by Cambridge

   Cambridge has agreed to cease, as of the date of the merger agreement, any
and all existing activities, discussions or negotiations with any parties
conducted prior to that date with respect to any "Acquisition Proposal," that
is, an offer or proposal relating to any "Acquisition Transaction," other than
an offer or proposal from Novell.

   An Acquisition Transaction is any transaction or series of related
transactions, other than the merger, involving any of the following:

  . the acquisition or purchase from Cambridge by any person or group of more
    than a 15% interest in the total outstanding voting securities of
    Cambridge or any of its subsidiaries;

  . any tender offer or exchange offer that if consummated would result in
    any person or group beneficially owning 15% or more of the total
    outstanding voting securities of Cambridge or any of its subsidiaries;

  . any merger, consolidation, business combination or similar transaction
    involving Cambridge pursuant to which the stockholders of Cambridge
    immediately preceding such transaction hold less than 85% of the equity
    interests in the surviving or resulting entity;

  . any sale, lease outside the ordinary course of business, exchange,
    transfer, license outside the ordinary course of business, acquisition or
    disposition of more than 15% of the assets of Cambridge; or

  . any liquidation or dissolution of Cambridge.

   Until the merger is completed or the merger agreement is terminated,
Cambridge has agreed that neither it nor any of its subsidiaries will, directly
or indirectly:

  . solicit, initiate, encourage or induce the making, submission or
    announcement of any Acquisition Proposal;

  . participate in any discussions or negotiations regarding any Acquisition
    Proposal;

  . furnish to any person any non-public information with respect to any
    Acquisition Proposal;

  . take any other action to facilitate any inquiries or the making of any
    proposal that constitutes or may reasonably be expected to lead to any
    Acquisition Proposal;

  . engage in discussions with any person with respect to any Acquisition
    Proposal;

  . subject to certain limited exceptions in the event of a "Superior Offer,"
    as discussed below, approve, endorse or recommend any Acquisition
    Proposal; or

  . enter into any letter of intent or similar document or any contract,
    agreement or commitment contemplating or otherwise relating to any
    Acquisition Transaction.

   For purposes of the foregoing, any violation of any of the restrictions in
the immediately preceding paragraph by any officer, director, affiliate or
employee of Cambridge or any investment banker, attorney or other advisor or
representative of Cambridge is deemed to be a breach of the relevant
restriction by Cambridge.

   A Superior Offer is an unsolicited, bona fide written offer made by a third
party to consummate any of the following transactions on terms that the board
of directors of Cambridge determines, in its reasonable judgment, after
consultation regarding the offer with its outside financial advisor, to be more
favorable to Cambridge stockholders than the terms of the merger involving
Novell:

  . a merger, consolidation, business combination, recapitalization,
    liquidation, dissolution or similar transaction involving Cambridge
    pursuant to which the stockholders of Cambridge immediately preceding the
    transaction hold less than 51% of the equity interest in the surviving or
    resulting entity of the transaction;

  . a sale or other disposition by Cambridge of all or substantially all of
    its assets; or

  . the acquisition by any person or group, including by way of a tender
    offer or an exchange offer or issuance by Cambridge, directly or
    indirectly, of beneficial ownership or a right to acquire beneficial
    ownership of shares representing in excess of 51% of the voting power of
    the then outstanding shares of capital stock of Cambridge.

   However, an offer will not be considered a Superior Offer if any financing
required to consummate the transaction contemplated by such offer is not
committed or is not likely in the judgment of Cambridge's board of directors to
be obtained by such third party on a timely basis.

   The merger agreement provides that these restrictions shall not prohibit
Cambridge from complying with Rule 14e-2 promulgated under the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. Moreover, the merger agreement allows
Cambridge to participate in discussions or negotiations with, or furnish
information regarding Cambridge pursuant to a confidentiality agreement to, any
person or group if all of the following conditions are met:

  .  the person or group has submitted a Superior Offer to Cambridge's board
     of directors;

  .  neither Cambridge nor any of its representatives or subsidiaries has
     breached the non-solicitation provisions contained in the merger
     agreement in connection with the Superior Offer;

  .  the board of directors of Cambridge determines in its good faith
     judgment, after consultation with its outside legal counsel, that
     failure to take such action would be inconsistent with its fiduciary
     duties under applicable law;

  .  the board of directors of Cambridge provides prior written notice to
     Novell of its decision to participate in negotiations and provide
     information; and

  .  Cambridge contemporaneously provides any information provided the person
     or group to Novell (to the extent such information has not been
     previously furnished).

   Cambridge has agreed to promptly inform Novell of any request for non-public
information that Cambridge reasonably believes would lead to an Acquisition
Proposal, or of any Acquisition Proposal, or any inquiry with respect to or
which Cambridge reasonably should believe would lead to any Acquisition
Proposal,

the material terms and conditions of such request, Acquisition Proposal or
inquiry, and the identity of the person or group making any such request,
Acquisition Proposal or inquiry.

   Under the merger agreement, the Cambridge directors are allowed to withhold,
withdraw, amend or modify their recommendation in favor of the merger if a
Superior Offer is made and not withdrawn, neither Cambridge nor any of its
representatives has breached the non-solicitation provisions of the merger
agreement in connection with the Superior Offer, and the board of directors of
Cambridge reasonably concludes in good faith, after consultation with its
outside counsel that, in light of the Superior Offer, the failure to withhold,
withdraw, amend or modify its recommendation would be inconsistent with the
directors' fiduciary obligations to Cambridge stockholders under applicable
law.

   Regardless of whether there has been a Superior Offer, Cambridge is
obligated under the merger agreement to hold and convene the Cambridge special
meeting of stockholders.

Treatment of Cambridge stock options and contingent obligation to issue shares

   All unexercised Cambridge options will be cancelled prior to or upon the
closing of the merger. For a discussion of equity grants to be made to
Cambridge employees and some directors following the merger, see the discussion
on pages 44 through 46 of this proxy statement-prospectus.

   The merger agreement provides that Cambridge's contingent obligation to
issue shares of its common stock pursuant to an earn-out agreement entered into
in connection with Cambridge's purchase of the business and assets of OSIX PTY
Ltd. will be assumed by Novell and become a contingent obligation to issue
Novell common stock with a fair value of up to two million Australian dollars
if the earn-out conditions are met.

Cambridge's employee benefit plans

   Following the merger and for one year thereafter, Novell will provide
Cambridge employees and its subsidiaries' employees with:

  .  substantially similar compensation, employee benefits and terms and
     conditions of employment, in the aggregate, as Novell provides to
     similarly situated employees of Novell;

  .  compensation, employee benefits and terms and conditions of employment
     that are substantially similar, in the aggregate, to those of Cambridge
     as in effect immediately prior to the merger; or

  .  a combination of the two above alternatives, provided that compensation,
     employee benefits and terms and conditions of employment, in the
     aggregate, are substantially similar to those in effect for the
     Cambridge employees immediately prior to the merger.

   Following the merger, each continuing employee will, to the extent permitted
by applicable law and applicable tax qualification requirements, receive
service credit for purposes of eligibility to participate and vesting (but not
for benefit accrual purposes) for employment, compensation and employee benefit
plan purposes with Cambridge or its subsidiaries prior to the merger.

Indemnification

   After completion of the merger, Novell will fulfill the obligations of
Cambridge pursuant to any indemnification provisions under Cambridge's
certificate of incorporation and bylaws and any indemnification agreements
between Cambridge and its directors and officers in effect immediately prior to
the completion of the merger.

   In addition, Cambridge's directors and officers will receive, for a period
of six years after the completion of the merger, directors and officers
insurance coverage with terms substantially the same as those of

Cambridge's existing directors and officers insurance policy for events
occurring on or prior to the completion of the merger through one of the
following mechanisms:

  .  a directors and officers insurance policy whose annual premium is not
     greater than 150% of the premium of Cambridge's policy in effect on the
     date of the merger agreement; or

  .  obtaining six-year "tail" coverage under Cambridge's existing directors
     and officers insurance policy.

Conditions to completion of the merger

   The obligations of Novell and Cambridge to complete the merger and the other
transactions contemplated by the merger agreement are subject to the
satisfaction or waiver of each of the following conditions before completion of
the merger:

  .  the merger agreement must be approved and adopted and the merger must be
     approved by the requisite holders of Cambridge stock;

  .  Novell's registration statement must be effective, no stop order
     suspending its effectiveness will be in effect and no proceedings for
     suspension of its effectiveness will be pending before or threatened by
     the SEC;

  .  no law, regulation or order must be enacted or issued which has the
     effect of making the merger illegal or otherwise prohibiting completion
     of the merger substantially on the terms contemplated by the merger
     agreement;

  .  all applicable waiting periods under applicable antitrust laws must have
     expired or been terminated; and

  .  Novell and Cambridge must each receive from their respective tax counsel
     an opinion to the effect that the merger will constitute a
     reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Internal
     Revenue Code, and such opinions shall not have been withdrawn.

   Cambridge's obligations to complete the merger and the other transactions
contemplated by the merger agreement are subject to the satisfaction or waiver
of each of the following additional conditions before completion of the merger:

  .  Novell's representations and warranties must be true and correct in all
     material respects as of March 12, 2001, and as of the date the merger is
     to be completed as if made at and as of such time except: to the extent
     Novell's representations and warranties address matters only as of a
     particular date, they must be true and correct as of that date and if
     any of these representations and warranties are not true and correct at
     the time of the merger, but the effect in each case, or in the
     aggregate, while disregarding all qualifications based on the word
     "material" within the representations and warranties, of the
     inaccuracies of these representations and breaches of these warranties,
     is not and does not have a material adverse effect on Novell, then this
     condition will be deemed satisfied;

  .  Novell must perform or comply in all material respects with all of its
     agreements and covenants required by the merger agreement to be
     performed or complied with by Novell at or before completion of the
     merger;

  .  the shares of Novell common stock to be issued in the merger must be
     authorized for listing on Nasdaq, subject to notice of issuance;

  .  Novell's board of directors shall have been increased from eight to ten
     directors, and two members of Cambridge's board of directors designated
     by Cambridge shall have been appointed to fill the newly created
     vacancies on Novell's board of directors; and

  .  Novell shall have offered Jack L. Messman the positions of president and
     chief executive officer of Novell effective on the completion of the
     merger on terms substantially similar to those of Mr. Messman's current
     employment agreement with Cambridge.

   Novell's and Ceres Neptune Acquisition Corp.'s obligations to complete the
merger and the other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement are
subject to the satisfaction or waiver of each of the following additional
conditions before completion of the merger:

  .  Cambridge's representations and warranties must be true and correct in
     all material respects as of March 12, 2001, and at and as of the date

     to the extent Cambridge's representations and warranties address matters
     only as of a particular date, they must be true and correct as of that
     date and if any of these representations and warranties are not true and
     correct at the time of the merger, but the effect in each case, or in
     the aggregate, while disregarding all qualifications based on the word
     "material" within the representations and warranties, of the
     inaccuracies of these representations and breaches of these warranties
     is not and does not have a material adverse effect on Cambridge, then
     this condition will be deemed satisfied;

  .  Cambridge must perform or comply in all material respects with all of
     its agreements and covenants required by the merger agreement to be
     performed or complied with by Cambridge at or before completion of the
     merger; and

     positions of president and chief executive officer of Novell to be
     effective on the completion of the merger.

Termination of the merger agreement

   The merger agreement may be terminated at any time prior to completion of
the merger, whether before or after approval and adoption of the merger
agreement and approval of the merger by Cambridge stockholders:

  .  by mutual consent of Novell and Cambridge;

  .  by Novell or Cambridge, if the merger is not completed before September
     30, 2001, except that this right to terminate the merger agreement is
     not available to any party whose action or failure to act has been a
     principal cause of or resulted in the failure of the merger to occur on
     or before September 30, 2001 and that action or failure to act
     constitutes a breach of the merger agreement;

  .  by Novell or Cambridge, if there is any order of a court or governmental
     authority having jurisdiction over either Novell or Cambridge
     permanently restraining, enjoining or prohibiting the completion of the
     merger, which is final and nonappealable;

  .  by Novell or Cambridge, if the merger fails to receive the requisite
     vote for approval by the stockholders of Cambridge at the Cambridge
     special meeting or at any adjournment of that meeting, except that this
     right to terminate the merger agreement is not available to Novell or
     Cambridge, as the case may be, where the failure to obtain Cambridge
     stockholder approval was caused by Novell's or Cambridge's, as the case
     may be, action or failure to act and this action or failure to act
     constitutes a breach by Novell or Cambridge, as the case may be, of the
     merger agreement;

  .  by Cambridge, upon a breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or
     agreement on the part of Novell in the merger agreement, or if any
     representation or warranty of Novell is or becomes untrue so that the
     corresponding condition to completion of the merger would not be met;
     however, if the breach or inaccuracy is curable by Novell through the
     exercise of its commercially reasonable efforts, and Novell continues to
     exercise such commercially reasonable efforts, Cambridge may not
     terminate the merger agreement for 30 days after delivery of written
     notice from Cambridge to Novell of the breach;

  .  by Novell, upon a breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or
     agreement on the part of Cambridge set forth in the merger agreement, or
     if any of Cambridge's representations or warranties is or becomes untrue
     so that the corresponding condition to completion of the merger would
     not be met; however, if the breach or inaccuracy is curable by Cambridge
     through the exercise of its commercially reasonable efforts and
     Cambridge continues to exercise such commercially reasonable efforts,
     Novell may not terminate the merger agreement for 30 days after delivery
     of written notice from Novell to Cambridge of the breach; or

  .  by Novell if a "Triggering Event" occurs; a Triggering Event is deemed
     to occur if:

   .  Cambridge's board of directors withdraws or amends or modifies in a
      manner adverse to Novell its recommendation in favor of the adoption
      and approval of the merger agreement or the approval of the merger;

   .  Cambridge fails to include in this proxy statement-prospectus the
      recommendation of Cambridge's board of directors in favor of the
      adoption and approval of the merger agreement and the approval of the
      merger;

   .  Cambridge's board of directors fails to reaffirm its recommendation in
      favor of the adoption and approval of the merger agreement and
      approval of the merger within ten business days after Novell requests
      in writing that such recommendation be reaffirmed;

   .  at any time following the announcement of an Acquisition Proposal,
      Cambridge's board of directors approves or recommends any Acquisition
      Proposal;

   .  Cambridge violates the non-solicitation provisions of the merger
      agreement; or

   .  a tender or exchange offer relating to not less than 15% of the then
      outstanding securities of Cambridge is commenced by a person
      unaffiliated with Novell, and Cambridge does not send to its
      securityholders within ten business days after such tender or exchange
      offer is first commenced a statement disclosing that Cambridge
      recommends rejection of such tender or exchange offer.

Payment of termination fee

   If the merger agreement is terminated by Novell because of the occurrence of
a Triggering Event, Cambridge will pay Novell a termination fee of $7.3 million
plus any expenses incurred by Novell in collecting such termination fee, upon
demand by Novell.

   Further, Cambridge will pay to Novell upon demand by Novell a termination
fee of $7.3 million plus expenses incurred by Novell in collecting such
termination fee, if the merger agreement is terminated by Novell or Cambridge
because the merger is not consummated by September 30, 2001, or because
Cambridge's stockholders do not approve the merger agreement, and either of the
following occur:

  .  prior to such termination, a third party has delivered an Acquisition
     Proposal and within 12 months following the termination of the merger
     agreement an acquisition of Cambridge is consummated; or

  .  prior to such termination, a third party has delivered an Acquisition
     Proposal and within 12 months following the termination of the merger
     agreement Cambridge enters into an agreement or letter of intent
     providing for an acquisition of Cambridge. An acquisition of Cambridge
     for these purposes is any of the following: a merger, consolidation,
     business combination, recapitalization, liquidation, dissolution or
     similar transaction involving Cambridge pursuant to which the
     stockholders of Cambridge immediately preceding such transaction hold
     less than 60% of the aggregate equity interests in the surviving or
     resulting entity of such transaction; or a sale or other disposition by
     Cambridge of assets representing in excess of 60% of the aggregate fair
     market value of Cambridge's business immediately prior to such sale; or
     the acquisition by any person or group, including by way of a tender
     offer or an exchange offer or issuance by Cambridge, directly or
     indirectly, of beneficial ownership or a right to acquire beneficial
     ownership of shares representing in excess of 40% of the voting power of
     the then outstanding shares of capital stock of Cambridge.

Extension, waiver and amendment of the merger agreement

   Novell and Cambridge may amend the merger agreement before completion of the
merger by mutual written consent. Either Novell or Cambridge may extend the
other's time for the performance of any of the obligations or other acts under
the merger agreement, waive any inaccuracies in the other's representations and
warranties and waive compliance by the other with any of the agreements or
conditions contained in the merger agreement.

                                OTHER AGREEMENTS

Voting agreements

   As an inducement to Novell to enter into the merger agreement, Jack L.
Messman, the president, chief executive officer and a director of Cambridge,
and all other executive officers and directors of Cambridge entered into voting
agreements with Novell. By entering into the voting agreements, these Cambridge
stockholders have irrevocably appointed Novell as their lawful attorney and
proxy. These proxies give Novell the limited right to vote the shares of
Cambridge common stock beneficially owned by these Cambridge stockholders,
including shares of Cambridge common stock acquired after the date of the
voting agreements:

  .  in favor of the approval and adoption of the merger agreement, the
     merger, each of the other transactions contemplated by the merger
     agreement, any other action required in furtherance of the merger; and

  .  against any proposal made in opposition to, or in competition with,
     consummation of the merger and the other transactions contemplated by
     the merger agreement; and any merger, asset sale, reorganization,
     recapitalization, dissolution or any other action intended, or which
     could reasonably be expected, to impede, interfere with or otherwise
     adversely affect the consummation of the merger and the other
     transactions contemplated by the merger agreement.

   These Cambridge stockholders may vote their shares of Cambridge common stock
on all other matters.

   As of the record date, the Cambridge stockholders who entered into voting
agreements with Novell collectively beneficially owned approximately 1.8% of
the outstanding Cambridge common stock. None of the Cambridge stockholders who
are parties to the voting agreements were paid additional consideration in
connection with them.

   Each Cambridge stockholder who is a party to a voting agreement agreed not
to sell, or transfer voting rights of, the Cambridge stock and options owned,
controlled or acquired, either directly or indirectly, by that person until the
earlier of the completion of the merger or termination of the merger agreement,
unless each person to which any shares, including voting rights or any interest
in any shares is transferred agrees to be bound by the terms and provisions of
the voting agreement, subject to specified exceptions.

   The Cambridge stockholders' voting agreements will terminate upon the
earlier to occur of the completion of the merger or termination of the merger
agreement.

Affiliate agreements

   As an inducement to Novell to enter into the merger agreement, each member
of the Cambridge board of directors and some officers of Cambridge will execute
affiliate agreements. Under the affiliate agreements, Novell will be entitled
to place appropriate legends on the certificates evidencing any Novell common
stock to be received by these persons and to issue stop transfer instructions
to the transfer agent for the Novell common stock. Further, these persons have
also acknowledged the resale restrictions imposed by Rule 145 under the
Securities Act on shares of Novell common stock to be received by them in the
merger.

Employment agreement

   Jack L. Messman, the president, chief executive officer and a director of
Cambridge, has to entered into an employment agreement with Novell that will go
into effect upon completion of the merger. For a summary of the terms of Mr.
Messman's employment agreement please see pages 42-43 of this proxy statement-
prospectus.

       NOVELL UNAUDITED PRO FORMA COMBINED CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

   In March 2001, Novell, Inc. entered into a merger agreement with Cambridge
Technology Partners (Massachusetts), Inc. whereby, upon consummation, Cambridge
will become a wholly owned subsidiary of Novell. Under the merger agreement
each share of Cambridge common stock issued and outstanding immediately prior
to the effective date will be cancelled and converted into the right to receive
0.668 of a share of Novell common stock. All outstanding stock options of
Cambridge will terminate and Novell will not assume the Cambridge stock option
plans. As of April 30, 2001, there were 63,532,722 shares of Cambridge common
stock issued and outstanding that will be converted to 42,439,859 shares of
Novell common stock. The merger will be accounted for using the purchase method
of accounting. The Unaudited Pro Forma Combined Condensed Financial Statements
have been prepared on the basis of assumptions described herein.

 What these pro forma statements show

   The unaudited pro forma combined condensed financial statements give effect
to the merger using the purchase method of accounting. The unaudited pro forma
combined condensed statement of operations for the year ended October 31, 2000
and the three months ended January 31, 2001 assume the merger took place on
November 1, 1999. The unaudited pro forma combined condensed balance sheet
assumes the merger took place on January 31, 2001.

   The Novell unaudited pro forma combined condensed statement of operations
for the year ended October 31, 2000 combine Novell's historical results of
operations for the year ended October 31, 2000 with Cambridge's historical
results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2000. The Novell
unaudited pro forma combined condensed statement of operations for the three
months ended January 31, 2001 combine Novell's historical results of operations
for the three months ended January 31, 2001 with Cambridge's historical results
of operations for the three months ended March 31, 2001. The Novell unaudited
pro forma combined condensed balance sheet combines Novell's historical balance
sheet as of January 31, 2001 with Cambridge's historical balance sheet as of
March 31, 2001.

 Basis of Presentation

   The Novell unaudited pro forma combined condensed financial statements
reflect the Cambridge merger accounted for using the purchase method of
accounting and have been prepared on the basis of assumptions described in the
notes, including assumptions relating to the allocation of the amount of
consideration paid to the assets and liabilities of Cambridge based upon
preliminary estimates of their fair value. The actual allocation of the amount
of consideration paid may differ from those assumptions after valuations and
other procedures are performed after the closing is completed.

 Merger Charges

   Novell expects to incur a liability for the estimated costs incurred as a
result of the merger, such as costs resulting from vacating duplicate Cambridge
facilities and reducing headcount. This liability is included as part of the
allocation of the purchase price. The unaudited pro forma combined condensed
balance sheet includes the effect of these charges. The unaudited pro forma
combined condensed statements of operations do not reflect these charges
because they are non-recurring. These charges will be reflected in Novell's
consolidated financial statements in the period in which the merger is
consummated.

 These pro forma unaudited combined condensed financial statements should be
 read with each company's financial statements

   The Novell unaudited pro forma combined condensed financial data should be
read in conjunction with the related notes included in this proxy statement-
prospectus and the consolidated audited and consolidated condensed unaudited
financial statements of Novell and the consolidated audited financial
statements of

Cambridge, which are incorporated by reference in this proxy statement-
prospectus. The Novell unaudited pro forma combined condensed financial data
are not necessarily indicative of what the actual results of operations and
financial position would have been had the Cambridge merger taken place on
November 1, 1999 or January 31, 2001, and do not indicate future results of
operations or financial position.

   On May 22, 2001, Novell announced its fiscal 2001 second quarter financial
results, which have not been incorporated into these pro forma statements.
Novell reported total revenue of $241 million and a net loss of $151.3 million
or $0.48 per share for the second fiscal quarter ended April 30, 2001. This
loss included a $142 million ($0.45 per share) write-down of equity
investments. Total assets were $1.569 billion at the end of the second quarter.

  NOTES TO NOVELL UNAUDITED PRO FORMA COMBINED CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

1. Basis of Presentation

   The unaudited pro forma combined condensed financial statements give effect
to Novell's acquisition of Cambridge through a merger and exchange of shares.
The merger is being accounted for using the purchase method of accounting. The
unaudited pro forma combined condensed financial statements have been prepared
on the basis of assumptions described in the following notes and include
assumptions relating to the allocation of the consideration paid for the assets
and liabilities of Cambridge based on estimated fair value. The final
allocation of the purchase price may differ from the preliminary allocations.
In the opinion of management, all adjustments necessary for a fair presentation
of such unaudited pro forma combined financial statements have been made based
on the proposed terms and structure of the merger.

   The unaudited pro forma combined condensed consolidated balance sheet as of
January 31, 2001 reflects the financial position of Novell after giving effect
to the merger with Cambridge as if this merger occurred on January 31, 2001.
The unaudited pro forma combined condensed consolidated statement of operations
for the three month period ended January 31, 2001 includes the results for
Novell for the three month period ended January 31, 2001 and the results for
Cambridge for the three month period ended March 31, 2001. The unaudited pro
forma combined condensed consolidated statement of operations for the year
ended October 31, 2000 includes the results for Novell for the year ended
October 31, 2000 and the results for Cambridge for the year ended December 31,
2000. Both of these statements assume the acquisition of Cambridge occurred on
at the beginning of the periods presented.

   As a result of Cambridge's acquisition of OSIX Pty. Ltd. in November 2000,
Novell may need to issue additional common stock with a fair value of up to 2
million Australian dollars at future dates if certain revenue and earnings
targets are met. Given the contingent nature of this consideration, such amount
is not included in the pro forma financial statements.

   Novell previously recognized revenue related to product sales to
distribution channel partners upon shipment to the partner and provided a
reserve for contractual return obligations and other estimated product returns.
Effective November 1, 2000, Novell changed its method of accounting for revenue
related to these product sales to recognize such revenues upon sell-through of
the respective product from the distribution channel partner to the end user.
Novell believes the change in accounting principle is preferable based on
guidance provided in SEC Staff Accounting Bulleting No. 101, Revenue
Recognition in Financial Statements. The pro forma financial statements include
an adjustment to present the accounting change as if its was made retroactively
to prior periods.

   The pro forma adjustments are preliminary and based on management's
estimates. Based on the timing of the closing of the transaction, the
finalization of the integration plans and other factors, final adjustments may
differ materially from those presented in these pro forma financial statements.
These unaudited pro forma combined condensed consolidated financial statements
should be read in conjunction with the historical annual and interim financial
statements of Novell and annual financial statements of Cambridge that have
been filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, as incorporated by
reference within this document.

2. Purchase Price Allocation

   Under the merger agreement each share of Cambridge common stock issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the effective date will be cancelled and
converted into the right to receive 0.668 of a share of Novell common stock. As
of the date of acquisition, all outstanding stock options will terminate and
Novell will not assume the Cambridge stock option plans. As of April 30, 2001,
there were 63,532,722 shares of Cambridge common stock outstanding. Based on
the 0.668 exchange ratio, these shares will be converted to 42,439,859 shares
of Novell common stock. In order to calculate the value of the Novell stock
issued, we

  NOTES TO NOVELL UNAUDITED PRO FORMA COMBINED CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

utilized a stock price of $5.907 per share, which was based on an average
closing price of Novell common stock for a period of three days before and
three days after March 12, 2001, the date the merger was announced. Based upon
this price and number of shares issued, stock consideration was estimated to
equal $250.7 million.

   The excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net assets
acquired will be allocated to goodwill and amortized over an estimated useful
life of four years. Annual amortization is expected to be approximately $22.6
million per year.

   In December 2000, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) announced
a major change in its approach to the accounting for goodwill as originally
proposed in its 1999 Exposure Draft, Business Combinations and Intangible
Assets. Under its current proposal, goodwill would not be amortized; instead,
it would be reviewed for impairment when certain events indicate that goodwill
is impaired. A final statement on business combinations is expected to be
issued in July 2001 and would be effective for Novell in fiscal 2003.

   Below is a table of the estimated acquisition costs and purchase price
allocation (in thousands):

                                                                 Estimated

   Transaction costs include direct transaction costs consisting primarily of
financial advisory services, legal, accounting and government filing fees.
Estimated costs to exit certain Cambridge activities include costs to vacate
facilities made duplicative by the merger. Novell expects that all duplicate
facilities will be vacated within one year after consummation of the merger.
The operating leases on these duplicate facilities have various termination
dates through 2023. Liabilities related to involuntary employee termination
benefits include amounts to be paid to Cambridge employees whose positions
become redundant and relocation of Cambridge employees whose functions are
being relocated to support a centralized infrastructure. The involuntary
terminations and relocation benefits relate to employees across all functional
organizations.

   Novell expects that a plan will be finalized in the quarter following
consummation of the merger and initial execution of this plan will begin in the
Novell's fourth fiscal quarter of 2001. Novell also expects the plan to be
implemented within one year from the consummation of the merger.

   These acquisition costs are estimated and are subject to change as Novell
may incur additional charges in subsequent quarters and actual costs associated
with the transaction could be higher than estimated. There is no assurance that
management will be successful in their efforts to integrate the operations of
Cambridge.

   Tangible net assets of Cambridge acquired in the merger principally include
cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments, accounts receivable, and
property, plant and equipment. Liabilities of Cambridge assumed in the merger
primarily include accounts payable and other accrued liabilities.

  NOTES TO NOVELL UNAUDITED PRO FORMA COMBINED CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

   Federal and state tax laws impose a limitation on the future use of certain
U.S. deferred tax attributes as a result of a change in ownership of a company.
Accordingly, some or all of the deferred tax assets of Cambridge may be subject
to a valuation allowance to reflect such limitations at the close of the
acquisition. The amount of goodwill will be increased by any valuation
allowance required.

3. Pro Forma Net Loss Per Share

   The unaudited pro forma combined condensed statements of operations have
been prepared as if the merger had occurred at the beginning of the periods
presented. For the year ended October 31, 2000 and for the three months ended
January 31, 2001, the pro forma net loss per share and loss per share before
cumulative effect of accounting change, respectively, is based on the weighted
average number of shares of Novell common stock outstanding during each period
and the number of shares of Novell common stock to be issued in connection with
the merger.

4. Pro Forma Adjustments

   Novell and Cambridge had some accounting policies and procedures that
differed. These differences primarily related to classification of assets as
well as line items in the liabilities and statement of operations line items.
The following pro forma adjustments include entries to conform the two
companies' accounting policies:

   (1) To account for the issuance of Novell common stock upon the completion
       of the merger, direct transaction costs, costs to be incurred for exit
       activities including vacating Cambridge facilities and reducing
       headcount, and the recording of goodwill (see note 2).

   (2) To reflect the reclassification of reimbursable expenses, advances,
       and other current assets from prepaid assets to other current assets
       to conform to Novell's presentation.

   (3) To reflect the reclassification of accrued salaries, vacation, bonuses
       and other payroll related items from other accrued liabilities to
       accrued compensation to conform to Novell's presentation.

   (4) To reflect the reclassification of accrued accounts payable from other
       accrued liabilities to accounts payable to conform to Novell's
       presentation.

   (5) To reflect the reclassification of marketing related liabilities from
       other accrued liabilities to accrued marketing liabilities to conform
       to Novell's presentation.

   (6) To reflect the reclassification of certain general and administrative
       costs to cost of sales and sales and marketing expenses to conform to
       Novell's presentation.

   (7) To reverse stock option benefits, credited by Novell for the fiscal
       year ended October 31, 2000, to reflect current U.S. taxes, offset by
       Cambridge net operating losses, and to provide a valuation allowance
       for the related deferred tax assets.

   (8) To reflect the elimination of the accounts that comprise Cambridge's
       stockholders' equity.

   (9) To reflect the impact on fiscal 2000 revenue for the change in
       accounting principle adopted by Novell in the first quarter of fiscal
       2001(see note 1).

  (10) To record the amortization of goodwill recorded in conjunction with
       the merger. Goodwill is being amortized over four years.

  (11) To adjust income tax expense based on income (loss) before taxes of
       the combined entities and deductible pro forma adjustments.

                       COMPARISON OF RIGHTS OF HOLDERS OF
                 CAMBRIDGE COMMON STOCK AND NOVELL COMMON STOCK

   This section of the proxy statement-prospectus describes material
differences between the rights of holders of Novell capital stock and Cambridge
capital stock. While Novell and Cambridge believe that the description covers
the material differences between the two companies, this summary may not
contain all of the information that is important to you. You should carefully
read this entire proxy statement-prospectus and the other documents referred to
in and incorporated by reference into this proxy statement-prospectus for a
more complete understanding of the differences between being a stockholder of
Novell and being a stockholder of Cambridge. The following description of the
capital stock of Novell and Cambridge does not purport to be complete, and is
subject to and qualified in its entirety by, the certificates of incorporation
and bylaws of the respective companies, and by the provisions of applicable
Delaware law.

Charter, bylaws and governing law

   Cambridge's Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation and Amended
and Restated Bylaws, each as currently in effect, govern your rights as a
stockholder of Cambridge. After completion of the merger, you will become a
stockholder of Novell. Novell's Restated Certificate of Incorporation and
Bylaws, each as currently in effect, will govern your rights as a stockholder
of Novell. Novell and Cambridge are each incorporated under the laws of the
State of Delaware. Accordingly, the Delaware General Corporation Law will
continue to govern your rights as a stockholder after completion of the merger.

Capitalization

   Description of capital stock of Novell and Cambridge

   The total authorized shares of capital stock of Novell consists of
600,000,000 shares of common stock, $0.10 par value per share, and 500,000
shares of preferred stock, $0.10 par value per share, designated as Series A
Junior Participating Preferred Stock. As of January 31, 2001, there were
317,653,609 shares of Novell common stock outstanding; there were no shares of
preferred stock issued or outstanding. As of that date, Novell had also
reserved 94,627,729 shares of common stock for issuance pursuant to its
employee and director stock and option and stock purchase plans; options were
outstanding for 62,265,857 of those shares.

   The total authorized shares of capital stock of Cambridge consists of
250,000,000 shares of common stock, $0.01 par value per share, and 2,000,000
shares of preferred stock, $0.01 par value per share, 100,000 of which have
been designated Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock. As of April 30,
2001, there were 63,532,722 shares of Cambridge common stock outstanding; there
were no shares of preferred stock issued or outstanding. As of March 11, 2001,
Cambridge had also reserved 23,189,746 shares of common stock for issuance
pursuant to its employee and director stock and option and stock purchase
plans; options were outstanding for 17,545,280 of those shares.

   Classes of preferred stock of Novell and Cambridge

   The certificates of incorporation of each of Novell and Cambridge provide
that the respective boards of directors are authorized to provide for the
issuance of shares of preferred stock in one or more series, and to fix the
designations, powers, preferences and rights of the shares of each series and
any qualifications, limitations or restrictions thereof.

   Novell has 500,000 shares of preferred stock, designated Series A Junior
Participating Preferred Stock, none of which are issued or outstanding. This
preferred stock is issuable upon exercise of certain rights declared as a
dividend for Novell common stock. Novell preferred stock issued upon exercise
of the Novell rights will not be redeemable. Each share of preferred stock will
be entitled to an aggregate dividend of 1,000 times the dividend declared per
share of Novell common stock. In the event of liquidation, the holders of

Novell preferred stock will be entitled to minimum preferential liquidation
payment equal to the greater of $1,000 per share and 1,000 times the per share
amount to be distributed to the holders of Novell common stock. Each share of
preferred stock will have 1,000 votes, voting together with the common stock.
Finally, in the event of any merger, consolidation or other transaction in
which Novell common stock is exchanged, each share of preferred stock will be
entitled to receive 1,000 times the amount received per share of common stock.
These rights are protected by customary anti-dilution provisions.

   Cambridge has 2,000,000 shares of preferred stock, 100,000 of which have
been designated Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock, none of which
are issued or outstanding. The Cambridge preferred stock is issuable upon
exercise of certain rights declared as a dividend for Cambridge common stock.
The Cambridge preferred stock has substantially similar rights, preferences and
privileges as does the Novell preferred stock.

Board of directors

   Novell's board of directors currently consists of eight directors. Under its
bylaws, Novell's board sets the number of directors on the board, at no fewer
than three or more than nine, however, the Novell directors have the right to
amend the bylaws and, in connection with the merger, the bylaws will be amended
to allow for ten directors. Novell directors serve for a term of one year, and
hold office until a successor is elected and qualified, or until death,
resignation or removal.

   Cambridge's board of directors currently consists of six directors. Under
its certificate of incorporation and bylaws, Cambridge's board sets the number
of directors on the board. Cambridge directors serve for a term of one year,
and hold office until a successor is elected and qualified, or until death,
resignation or removal.

   For a more detailed description regarding amendment of bylaws and
certificates of incorporation, see "Amendment of bylaws" on page 74 and
"Amendment of certificate of incorporation" on page 73.

Removal of directors

   Novell's certificate of incorporation and bylaws are silent as to the
process for removing directors, but under Delaware law, any director, or the
entire board of directors, of Novell may be removed at any time with or without
cause by the holders of a majority of the shares then entitled to vote at an
election of directors.

   Cambridge's Bylaws provide that any member of Cambridge's board may be
removed at any time with or without cause, by the vote of the holders of a
majority of the shares of stock entitled to vote at an election of directors or
for cause by the vote of a majority of the directors then in office. However, a
Cambridge director may be removed for cause only after the director has been
afforded reasonable notice and an opportunity to be heard before the board or
the stockholders, as the case may be, which proposes removing the director.

Stockholder ability to call special meetings

   A special meeting of Novell stockholders may be called by the chairman of
the board of directors, a majority of the board, the president or at the
written request of the holders of a majority of the stock issued and
outstanding and entitled to vote.

   A special meeting of Cambridge stockholders may be called by the president,
the board of directors or upon the written request of holders of at least 25%
of the stock entitled to vote.

Advance notice provisions for stockholder nominations and proposals

   Novell's bylaws allow any stockholder to nominate candidates for election to
Novell's board of directors at, and to propose business to be brought before, a
stockholder meeting. A stockholder who seeks to nominate a candidate or make a
proposal must give timely written notice to the Secretary of Novell before the
stockholder meeting, and must have been a stockholder of record on the date
notice of the stockholder meeting was given.

   In the case of an annual stockholder meeting, notice of any proposed
business by a Novell stockholder is timely if notice is received by the
Secretary of Novell not later than 60 days before the first anniversary of the
date on which Novell mailed notice of the previous year's annual meeting to
stockholders or if the notice relates to the nomination of directors, if notice
is given to the Secretary of Novell not later than 90 days before the date of
the annual meeting and such notice is received by the Secretary of Novell not
later than 60 days before the first anniversary of the date on which Novell
mailed notice of the previous year's annual meeting to stockholders.

   In the case of director nomination at a special meeting of stockholders
called for the purpose of electing directors, notice relating to the nomination
of directors is timely if given to the Secretary of Novell by the close of
business on the seventh day following the date on which notice of the special
meeting was first given to stockholders.

   A stockholder's notice to Novell must include the name and address of the
stockholder and the beneficial owner, if any, as they appear on Novell's books
and the class and number of shares of Novell which are owned by the stockholder
and beneficial owner.

   A stockholder's notice for proposed business must also include a brief
description of the business the stockholder proposes to bring before the
meeting, the reasons for conducting that business at that meeting and any
material interest of the stockholder in the business proposed and the
beneficial owner, if any, on whose behalf the proposal is made.

   A stockholder's notice for director nominations must also include the
following:

  . as to each nominee proposed by the stockholder, the name and address of
    the nominee, and all information required to be disclosed in
    solicitations of proxies for election of directors, or information
    otherwise required by applicable law, including that person's written
    consent to being named in the proxy statement as a nominee and to serving
    as a director if elected; and

  . a representation that the stockholder is a holder of record of Novell
    stock, the number of shares of Novell stock held by the stockholder,
    whether the stockholder is entitled to vote at the stockholder meeting,
    and whether the stockholder intends to appear in person or by proxy at
    the meeting to nominate the person specified in the notice; and

  . a description of all arrangements or understandings between the
    stockholder and the nominee or third parties regarding the nomination.

   Cambridge's bylaws allow any stockholder to nominate candidates for election
to Cambridge's board of directors at, and to propose business to be brought
before, an annual stockholder meeting. Cambridge's bylaws also allow any
stockholder to nominate candidates for election to Cambridge's board of
directors at a special stockholder meeting called for the purpose of electing
directors. A stockholder who seeks to nominate a candidate or make a proposal
must give timely written notice to the Secretary of Cambridge before the
stockholder meeting, and must have been a stockholder of record on the date
notice of the stockholder meeting was given.

   In the case of an annual stockholder meeting, notice by a Cambridge
stockholder is timely if delivered to the Secretary of Cambridge at Cambridge's
principal offices not later than the close of business on the 60th day nor
earlier than the close of business on the 90th day prior to the first
anniversary of the previous year's annual meeting or if the date of the annual
meeting is more than 30 days before or more than 60 days after the anniversary
date, not earlier than the close of business on the 90th day before the date of
the annual stockholder meeting and not later than the close of business on the
later of the 60th day before the annual meeting or the close of business on the
10th day following the date on which the date of the annual meeting was
publicly announced; or in the case of a special meeting of stockholders called
for the purpose of electing directors, not earlier than the close of business
on the 90th day before the date of the special stockholder meeting and not
later than the close of business of the 60th day before the special meeting or
the close of business on the 10th day following the date on which the date of
the special meeting was publicly announced.

   A stockholder's notice to Cambridge must set forth the following
information: the name and address of the stockholder and the beneficial owner,
if any, as they appear on Cambridge's books and the class and number of shares
of Cambridge which are owned by the stockholder and beneficial owner; if any;
and for proposed business, a brief description of the business the stockholder
proposes to bring before the meeting, the reasons for conducting that business
at that meeting and any material interest of the stockholder in the business
proposed and the beneficial owner, if any, on whose behalf the proposal is
made; or for director nominations, as to each nominee proposed by the
stockholder, the name and address of the nominee, and all information required
to be disclosed in solicitations of proxies for election of directors, or
information otherwise required by applicable law, including that person's
written consent to being named in the proxy statement as a nominee and to
serving as a director if elected.

Stockholder proxies

   Novell's bylaws specifically provide that a proxy must be executed in
writing by the stockholder or an attorney-in-fact and filed with the Secretary
of Novell. Furthermore, a proxy, unless coupled with an interest, is revocable
at will by the Novell stockholder, notwithstanding any agreements to the
contrary, but any revocation is ineffective until the stockholder has given
notice to the Secretary of Novell. A proxy is not revoked by death or
incapacity of the stockholder unless written notice of the death or incapacity
is sent to the Secretary of Novell before the vote is counted or the authority
is exercised.

   Cambridge's bylaws only require that a proxy be in writing or transmitted
as otherwise permitted by law.

Stockholder voting

   Novell's bylaws provide that when a quorum is present at any stockholder
meeting, the vote of the holders of the majority of the stock having voting
power present in person or represented by proxy is required to approve any
issue brought before the meeting, unless a different vote is required by law
or Novell's bylaws or certificate of incorporation.

   Cambridge's bylaws provide that when a quorum is present at any stockholder
meeting, the vote of a majority of shares cast affirmatively or negatively at
the meeting is required to approve any action other than election of
directors, unless a different vote is required by law or Cambridge's
certificate of incorporation. Election of directors is determined by a
plurality of the votes cast at the meeting. Under Delaware law, adoption of
the merger agreement and approval of the merger require the affirmative vote
of a majority of outstanding shares of Cambridge common stock.

Notice of stockholder meetings

   Novell's bylaws provide that written notice of the place, date and hour of
every meeting of stockholders, annual or special, must be given to each
stockholder entitled to vote at the meeting not less than ten, nor more than
60, days before the date of the meeting.

   Cambridge's bylaws provide that written notice of the place, date and hour
of all meetings of stockholders must be given to each stockholder entitled to
vote at the meeting not less than ten, nor more than 50, days before the date
of the meeting.

Amendment of certificate of incorporation

   Under Delaware law, a certificate of incorporation of a Delaware
corporation may be amended by approval of the board of directors of the
corporation and the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the
outstanding shares entitled to vote for the amendment, unless a higher vote is
required by the corporation's certificate of incorporation.

   Novell's certificate of incorporation does not contain any provisions
requiring a vote greater than that required by Delaware law to amend its
certificate of incorporation. It does provide, however, that any amendment that
materially and adversely alters or changes the powers, preference or special
rights of the Novell Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock requires the
affirmative vote of the holders of at least a majority of the then-outstanding
shares of Novell Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock voting
separately as a class.

   Cambridge's certificate of incorporation does not contain any provisions
requiring a vote greater than that required by Delaware law to amend its
certificates of incorporation. It does provide, however, that any charter
amendment that materially and adversely alters or changes the powers,
preference or special rights of the Cambridge Series A Junior Participating
Preferred Stock requires the affirmative vote of the holders of at least 75% of
the then-outstanding shares of Cambridge Series A Junior Participating
Preferred Stock voting separately as a class.

Amendment of bylaws

   The respective boards of directors of Novell and Cambridge are expressly
authorized to adopt, amend and repeal the companies' respective bylaws. In
addition, under Delaware law, stockholders have the power to adopt, amend or
repeal bylaws, even though the board of directors may also be delegated such
power.

   The bylaws of Cambridge also specifically provide that:

  . the Cambridge board may not amend or repeal the bylaw provision regarding
    amendment of the bylaws, or any other provision of its bylaws which
    require action by Cambridge stockholders; and

  . Cambridge stockholders may repeal or amend any amendment, repeal or
    adoption of bylaws by the Cambridge board.

Rights plans

   The board of directors of Cambridge previously adopted a stockholder rights
plan, which provides for a dividend of rights to holders of Cambridge common
stock. The board of directors of Novell also previously adopted a stockholder
rights plan, which provides for a dividend of rights to holders of Novell
common stock. The terms of the rights for Novell and Cambridge are
substantively similar, with certain exceptions.

   Under certain conditions, each Novell right is exercisable to purchase
1/1000 of a share of Novell Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock at a
price $120 per 1/1000 of a share of Novell Series A Junior Participating
Preferred Stock. Similarly, each Cambridge right is exercisable to purchase
1/1000 of a share of Cambridge Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock,
but at a price of $200 per 1/1000 of a share of Cambridge Series A Junior
Participating Preferred Stock.

   The Novell rights are exercisable only upon:

  . a public announcement that a person or group of affiliated persons has
    acquired beneficial ownership of 15% or more of Novell common stock; or

  . the commencement of, or announcement of an intention to make, a tender
    offer or exchange offer that would result in the beneficial ownership by
    a person or group of 15% or more of Novell common stock if consummated.

   The Cambridge rights are exercisable upon the occurrence of similar events,
as well as if a majority of the directors of Cambridge declares that any person
or group has become the beneficial owner of an amount of Cambridge common stock
which the board determines to be substantial and the acquisition of such stock
is:

  . intended to cause Cambridge to enter into transactions to provide the
    person or group with short-term gains at the expense of Cambridge's long-
    term interests; or

  . likely to have a material adverse impact on Cambridge's business or
    prospects.

   If a person or group becomes the beneficial owner of 15% or more of Novell
common stock, each holder of a Novell right (other than the beneficial owner
person or group) may receive upon exercise of the right a number of shares of
Novell common stock equal to the exercise price of a Novell right divided by
one-half the current market price of a share of Novell common stock.

   Holders of Cambridge rights have a right to receive shares of Cambridge
common stock in similar proportions if:

  . a person or group acquires beneficial ownership of 15% or more of
    Cambridge common stock;

  . Cambridge is the surviving corporation in a merger with a person or group
    and its common stock is not changed or exchanged;

  . a person or group engages in certain "self-dealing" transactions; or

  . an event occurs which results in a person or group's beneficial ownership
    interest being increased by more than 1%, as in a reverse stock split.

   If, after a person or group has acquired beneficial ownership of 15% or more
of Novell common stock, Novell merges with or into another entity or Novell
sells more than 50% of its earning power, then each holder of a Novell right
(other than the beneficial owner person or group) may receive upon exercise of
the right a number of shares of the stock of the acquiring or merging entity
equal to the exercise price of a Novell right divided by one-half the current
market price of a share of the stock of the acquiring or merging entity.

   Holders of Cambridge rights have a similar right to acquire shares of the
stock of a merging or acquiring entity.

   At any time after a person or group acquires beneficial ownership of 15% or
more of the common stock of Novell, the board may:

  . exchange the Novell rights (other than those rights held by the
    beneficial owner person or group), in whole or in part, at an exchange
    ratio of one share of Novell common stock for each Novell right; or

  . at any time within 10 days after the acquisition of 15% ownership by a
    person or group, redeem the Novell rights in whole, but not in part, at a
    price of $0.01 per right, and the Novell rights terminate immediately
    upon redemption.

   The board of Cambridge may also exchange or redeem the Cambridge rights on
similar terms.

   The Novell rights expire on November 21, 2006, unless earlier exchanged or
redeemed.

   Pursuant to the merger agreement between Novell and Cambridge, the Cambridge
rights have been rendered inapplicable to the proposed merger and the related
transactions. Furthermore, the Cambridge rights plan has been amended to
terminate upon the earlier of the closing of the proposed merger and June 23,
2007.

Indemnification of directors and officers

   In actions brought by third parties, and not by or on behalf of the
corporations, the respective certificates of incorporation and bylaws of Novell
and Cambridge permit each corporation to indemnify its officers and directors
for actions taken in good faith and in a manner that the officers or directors
reasonably believed to be in, or not opposed to, the best interests of the
corporation, and with respect to any criminal action, which they had no
reasonable cause to believe was unlawful. However, Cambridge will not indemnify
an officer or director in connection with a proceeding initiated by the officer
or director, unless the initiation was approved by the Cambridge board.

   In actions brought by or on behalf of the corporations, the respective
certificates of incorporation and bylaws of Novell and Cambridge permit each
corporation to indemnify its officers and directors for actions taken in good
faith and in a manner that the officers or directors reasonably believed to be
in, or not opposed to, the best interests of the corporation. However, officers
and directors will not be indemnified if:

  . in the case of Novell, the officer or director was adjudged liable for
    negligence or misconduct, unless the relevant court determines that the
    officer or director is fairly and reasonably entitled to indemnity; or

  . in the case of Cambridge, the officer or director was adjudged liable,
    unless the relevant court determines that the officer or director is
    fairly and reasonably entitled to indemnity.

   Additionally, each of the corporations may pay expenses incurred by its
directors or officers in defending a civil or criminal action, suit or
proceeding because that person is a director or officer, in advance of the
final disposition of that action, suit or proceeding. However, such payment
will be made only upon an undertaking by or on behalf of that director or
officer to repay all amounts advanced if it is ultimately determined that the
director or officer is not entitled to be indemnified by the respective
corporation, as authorized by our respective certificates of incorporation and
bylaws.

   In addition, Delaware law permits a corporation to purchase and maintain
insurance on behalf of its officers and directors. Novell does not specifically
authorize such insurance in its certificate of incorporation or bylaws.
Cambridge's certificate of incorporation does authorize such insurance on
behalf of its directors and officers.

Arrangements binding on stockholders

   Novell's certificate of incorporation provides that if an arrangement is
proposed between Novell and its creditors and/or between Novell and its
stockholders, the relevant court may, on the application of Novell, its
creditors, its stockholders or trustees or receivers appointed pursuant to
Delaware law, order a meeting of the creditors and/or Novell stockholders. If
3/4 in value of the creditors and/or stockholders agree to any arrangement and
subsequent reorganization of Novell at the meeting, the arrangement and
reorganization will be binding on Novell and all of the creditors and/or
stockholders, if sanctioned by the court.

   Cambridge's charter does not have such a provision.

the debts, liabilities and duties of the Surviving Corporation.

   1.4 Certificate of Incorporation; Bylaws.

     (a) At the Effective Time, the Certificate of Incorporation of Merger
  Sub as in effect on the date hereof and subject to the following proviso,

  Effective Time, shall be, at the Effective Time, the Bylaws of the
  Surviving Corporation.

   1.5 Directors and Officers. The directors of Merger Sub immediately prior to

   1.6 Effect on Capital Stock. Subject to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement, at the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any
action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, Company or the holders of any of the
following securities, the following shall occur:

     (a) Conversion of Company Common Stock. Each share of Common Stock, par
  value $0.01 per share, of Company (the "Company Common Stock") issued and
  outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than any share
  of Company Common Stock to be canceled and extinguished pursuant to Section
  1.6(b)) will be automatically converted (subject to Sections 1.6(e) and
  (f)) into 0.668 (the "Exchange Ratio") of a validly issued, fully paid and
  nonassessable share of Common Stock, par value $0.10 per share, of Parent
  (the "Parent Common Stock"), which shall be referred to in this Agreement
  as the "Merger Consideration." If any shares of Company Common Stock
  outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time are unvested or are
  subject to a repurchase option, risk of forfeiture or other condition under
  any applicable restricted stock purchase agreement or other agreement with
  Company, then the shares of Parent Common Stock issued in exchange for such
  shares of Company Common Stock will also be unvested and subject to the
  same repurchase option, risk of forfeiture or other condition, and the
  certificates representing such shares of Parent Common Stock may
  accordingly be marked with appropriate legends.

     (b) Cancellation of Company-Owned Stock. Each share of Company Common
  Stock held by Company or any direct or indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of
  Company immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be canceled and
  extinguished without any conversion thereof.

                                      A-2

     (c) Stock Options; Earn-Out Right. At the Effective Time, all options to
  purchase Company Common Stock then outstanding under Company's 1998 Stock
  Option Plan, 1997 Stock Option Plan, 1991 Stock Option Plan, 1995 Non-
  employee Director Stock Option Plan, Axiom Stock Option Plan, IOS Gruppen
  Stock Plan and SCG Option Plan (collectively, the "Company Option Plans"),
  whether vested or unvested, and the Company Option Plans themselves, shall
  be assumed by Parent in accordance with Section 5.8. At the Effective Time,
  all obligations to deliver shares of Company Common Stock (the "Earn-Out
  Agreement") under the Agreement for the Purchase of the Business and Assets
  of OSIX Pty Ltd., dated November 3, 2000, among the Company, Cambridge
  Technology Partners Pty Ltd., the Warrantors and OSIX Pty Ltd., shall be
  assumed by Parent in accordance with Section 5.8(c) hereof.

     (d) Capital Stock of Merger Sub. Each share of Common Stock, $0.01 par
  value per share, of Merger Sub (the "Merger Sub Common Stock") issued and
  outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into
  one validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of Common Stock,
  $0.01 par value per share, of the Surviving Corporation. Each certificate
  evidencing ownership of shares of Merger Sub Common Stock shall evidence
  ownership of such shares of capital stock of the Surviving Corporation.

     (e) Adjustments to Exchange Ratio. The Exchange Ratio shall be adjusted
  to reflect appropriately the effect of any stock split, reverse stock
  split, stock dividend (including any dividend or distribution of securities
  convertible into or exercisable or exchangeable for Parent Common Stock or
  Company Common Stock), extraordinary cash dividend, reorganization,
  recapitalization, reclassification, combination, exchange of shares or
  other like change with respect to Parent Common Stock or Company Common
  Stock occurring or having a record date on or after the date hereof and
  prior to the Effective Time.

     (f) Fractional Shares.

       (i) No fraction of a share of Parent Common Stock will be issued by
    virtue of the Merger, but in lieu thereof, each holder of shares of
    Company Common Stock who would otherwise be entitled to a fraction of a
    share of Parent Common Stock (after aggregating all fractional shares
    of Parent Common Stock that otherwise would be received by such holder)
    shall, upon surrender of such holder's Certificates(s) (as defined in
    Section 1.7(c) hereof), receive from the Exchange Agent (as defined in
    Section 1.7(a) hereof) an amount of cash (rounded to the nearest whole
    cent), without interest, representing such holder's proportionate
    interest in the net proceeds from the sale by the Exchange Agent in one
    or more transactions (which sale transactions shall be made at such
    times, in such manner and on such terms as the Exchange Agent shall
    determine in its reasonable discretion) on behalf of all such holders
    of the aggregate of the fractional shares of Parent Common Stock as
    applicable (the "Excess Parent Common Stock"). The sale of the Excess
    Parent Common Stock by the Exchange Agent shall be executed on the
    Nasdaq National Market ("Nasdaq") and shall be executed in round lots
    to the extent practicable. Until the proceeds of such sale or sales
    have been distributed to the former holders of Company Common Stock,
    the Exchange Agent shall hold such proceeds for the benefit of such
    holders without liability or obligation to invest such amounts or to
    pay interest thereon to such holders. Parent shall reimburse the
    Exchange Agent for all reasonable commissions, transfer taxes and other
    out-of-pocket transaction costs, including expenses incurred and
    commissions paid by the Exchange Agent in connection with the sale of
    the Excess Parent Common Stock. The Exchange Agent shall determine the
    portion of such net proceeds to which each former holder of shares of
    Company Common Stock shall be entitled, if any, by multiplying the
    amount of the aggregate net proceeds by a fraction the numerator of
    which is the amount of the fractional share interest to which such
    former holder of shares of Company Common Stock is entitled (after
    taking into account all shares of Company Common Stock then held by
    such former holder) and the denominator of which is the aggregate
    amount of fractional interests to which all former holders of shares of
    Company Common Stock are entitled.

       (ii) Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 1.6(f)(i) hereof,
    Parent may elect, at its option exercised prior to the Effective Time,
    and in lieu of the issuance and sale of the Excess Parent

                                      A-3

    Common Stock and the making of the payments contemplated in Section
    1.6(f)(i) hereof, to pay to the Exchange Agent an amount of cash
    sufficient for the Exchange Agent to pay each former holder of shares
    of Company Common Stock who would otherwise be entitled to a fraction
    of a share of Parent Common Stock (after aggregating all fractional
    shares of Parent Common Stock to be received by such holder) an amount
    of cash (rounded to the nearest whole cent) equal to the product
    obtained by multiplying (x) such fraction of a share of Parent Common
    Stock by (y) the average closing price of one share of Parent Common
    Stock for the five (5) most recent days that Parent Common Stock has
    traded ending on the trading day immediately prior to the Effective
    Time, as reported on Nasdaq.

   1.7 Surrender of Certificates.

     (a) Exchange Agent. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall select a
  bank or trust company reasonably acceptable to Company to act as the
  exchange agent (the "Exchange Agent") in the Merger.

     (b) Parent to Provide Common Stock. As of the Effective Time, Parent
  shall deposit with the Exchange Agent, for exchange in accordance with this
  Article I, the shares of Parent Common Stock issuable pursuant to Section
  1.6(a) in exchange for outstanding shares of Company Common Stock, and cash
  in an amount sufficient for payment in lieu of fractional shares pursuant
  to Section 1.6(f) and any dividends or distributions to which holders of
  shares of Company Common Stock may be entitled pursuant to Section 1.7(d).

     (c) Exchange Procedures. As soon as practicable after the Effective Time
  (but in no event more than five business days after the Effective Time)
  Parent shall cause the Exchange Agent to mail to each holder of record (as
  of the Effective Time) of a certificate or certificates, which immediately
  prior to the Effective Time represented outstanding shares of Company
  Common Stock (the "Certificates") (i) a letter of transmittal in customary
  form (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss
  and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of the
  Certificates to the Exchange Agent) and (ii) instructions for use in
  effecting the surrender of the Certificates in exchange for certificates
  representing shares of Parent Common Stock pursuant to Section 1.6(a), cash
  in lieu of any fractional shares pursuant to Section 1.6(f), and any
  dividends or other distributions pursuant to Section 1.7(d). Upon surrender
  of Certificates for cancellation to the Exchange Agent or to such other
  agent or agents as may be appointed by Parent, together with such letter of
  transmittal, duly completed and validly executed in accordance with the
  instructions thereto, the holders of such Certificates shall be entitled to
  receive in exchange therefor certificates representing the number of whole
  shares of Parent Common Stock into which their shares of Company Common
  Stock were converted pursuant to Section 1.6(a), together with payment in
  lieu of fractional shares which such holders have the right to receive
  pursuant to Section 1.6(f) and any dividends or other distributions payable
  pursuant to Section 1.7(d), and the Certificates so surrendered shall
  forthwith be canceled. Until so surrendered, outstanding Certificates will
  be deemed, from and after the Effective Time, to evidence only the
  ownership of the number of whole shares of Parent Common Stock into which
  such shares of Company Common Stock shall have been so converted (including
  any voting, notice or other rights associated with the ownership of such
  shares of Parent Common Stock under the Certificate of Incorporation or
  Bylaws of Parent or under Delaware Law) and the right to receive an amount
  in cash in lieu of the issuance of any fractional shares in accordance with
  Section 1.6(f) and any dividends or other distributions payable pursuant to
  Section 1.7(d).

     (d) Distributions With Respect to Unexchanged Shares. Dividends or other
  distributions declared or made after the date of this Agreement with
  respect to Parent Common Stock with a record date after the Effective Time
  will be paid to the holders of any unsurrendered Certificates with respect
  to the shares of Parent Common Stock represented thereby when the holders
  of record of such Certificates surrender such Certificates.

     (e) Transfers of Ownership. If certificates representing shares of
  Parent Common Stock are to be issued in a name other than that in which the
  Certificates surrendered in exchange therefor are registered, it will be a
  condition of the issuance thereof that the Certificates so surrendered will
  be properly endorsed and otherwise in proper form for transfer and that the
  persons requesting such exchange will have (i) paid

                                      A-4

  to Parent or any agent designated by it any transfer or other taxes
  required by reason of the issuance of certificates representing shares of
  Parent Common Stock in any name other than that of the registered holder of
  the Certificates surrendered, or (ii) established to the satisfaction of
  Parent or any agent designated by it that such tax has been paid or is not
  payable.

     (f) Required Withholding. Each of the Exchange Agent, Parent and the
  Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from any
  consideration payable or otherwise deliverable pursuant to this Agreement
  to any holder or former holder of Company Common Stock such amounts as may
  be required to be deducted or withheld therefrom under the Code or state,
  local or foreign law. To the extent such amounts are so deducted or
  withheld, such amounts shall be treated for all purposes under this
  Agreement as having been paid to the person to whom such amounts would
  otherwise have been paid.

     (g) No Liability. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
  Section 1.7, neither the Exchange Agent, Parent, the Surviving Corporation
  nor any party hereto shall be liable to a holder of shares of Parent Common
  Stock or Company Common Stock for any amount properly paid to a public
  official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar
  law.

   1.8 No Further Ownership Rights in Company Common Stock. All shares of
Parent Common Stock issued in accordance with the terms hereof (including any
cash paid in respect thereof pursuant to Sections 1.6(f) and 1.7(d)) shall be
deemed to have been issued in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to
such shares of Company Common Stock. There shall be no further registration of
transfers on the records of the Surviving Corporation of shares of Company
Common Stock which were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time.
If, after the Effective Time, Certificates are presented to the Surviving
Corporation for any reason, they shall be canceled and exchanged as provided in
this Article I.

   1.9 Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates. In the event that any
Certificates shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, the Exchange Agent
shall issue and pay in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed
Certificates, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the holder
thereof, certificates representing the shares of Parent Common Stock into which
the shares of Company Common Stock represented by such Certificates were
converted pursuant to Section 1.6(a), cash for fractional shares, if any, as
may be required pursuant to Section 1.6(f) and any dividends or distributions
payable pursuant to Section 1.7(d); provided, however, that the Exchange Agent,
may, in its discretion and as a condition precedent to the issuance of such
certificates representing shares of Parent Common Stock and the payment of cash
and other distributions, require the owner of such lost, stolen or destroyed
Certificates to deliver a bond in such sum as it may reasonably direct as
indemnity against any claim that may be made against Parent, the Surviving
Corporation or the Exchange Agent with respect to the Certificates alleged to
have been lost, stolen or destroyed.

   1.10 Tax and Accounting Consequences.

     (a) It is intended by the parties hereto that the Merger shall
  constitute a reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the
  Code. The parties hereto adopt this Agreement as a "plan of reorganization"
  within the meaning of Sections 1.368-2(g) and 1.368-3(a) of the United
  States Treasury Regulations.

     (b) It is intended by the parties hereto that the Merger shall qualify
  as a "purchase" transaction for accounting purposes.

   1.11 Taking of Necessary Action; Further Action. If, at any time after the
Effective Time, any further action is necessary or desirable to carry out the
purposes of this Agreement and to vest the Surviving Corporation with full
right, title and possession to all assets, property, rights, privileges, powers
and franchises of Company and Merger Sub, the officers and directors of Parent
and the Surviving Corporation shall be fully authorized (in the name of Merger
Sub, Company, the Surviving Corporation and otherwise) to take all such
necessary action.

supplied or to be supplied by Parent for inclusion or incorporation by

make the statements therein not misleading and (ii) the Proxy
Statement/Prospectus shall not, on the date the Proxy Statement/Prospectus is
first mailed to Company's stockholders, at the time of the Company
Stockholders' Meeting and at the Effective Time, contain any untrue statement
of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated
therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they are made, not false or

                                      A-21

misleading, or omit to state any material fact necessary to correct any
statement in any earlier communication with respect to the solicitation of

Agreement and the other transactions contemplated hereby and (iii) adopted a
resolution declaring the Merger Agreement advisable and approving the Share
Issuance (in the case of Parent).

   3.13 Parent Intellectual Property. To the knowledge of Parent, the operation
of the business of Parent and its subsidiaries as such business currently is
conducted does not materially infringe or misappropriate the Intellectual
Property of any third party where such infringement would have a Material
Adverse Effect on Parent.

Returns relating to Taxes required to be filed by Parent and each of its

                             Additional Agreements

   5.1 Proxy Statement/Prospectus; S-4; Other Filings; Board Recommendations.

     (a) As promptly as practicable after the execution of this Agreement,
  Parent and Company shall jointly prepare and Parent shall file with the SEC
  the S-4, which shall include a document or documents that will constitute
  (i) the prospectus forming part of the registration statement on the S-4
  and (ii) the Proxy Statement/Prospectus. Each of the parties hereto shall
  use all commercially reasonable efforts to cause the S-4 to become
  effective as promptly as practicable after the date hereof, and, prior to
  the effective date of the S-4. Each of Parent and Company shall provide
  promptly to the other such information concerning its business and
  financial statements and affairs as, in the reasonable judgment of the
  providing party as advised by its counsel, may be required or appropriate
  for inclusion in the Proxy Statement/Prospectus and the S-4, or in any
  amendments or supplements thereto, and cause its counsel and auditors to
  reasonably cooperate with the other's counsel and auditors in the
  preparation of the Proxy Statement/Prospectus and the S-4. As promptly as
  practicable after the effective date of the S-4, the Proxy
  Statement/Prospectus shall be mailed to the stockholders of Company. Each
  of the parties hereto shall cause the Proxy Statement/Prospectus to comply
  in all material respects as to form and substance with respect to such
  party with the applicable requirements of (i) the Exchange Act, (ii) the
  Securities Act, and (iii) the rules and regulations of the Nasdaq. As
  promptly as practicable after the date of this Agreement, each of Company
  and Parent will prepare and file any other filings required to be filed by
  it under the Exchange Act, the Securities Act or any other Federal, foreign
  or Blue Sky or related laws relating to the Merger and the transactions
  contemplated by this Agreement (the "Other Filings"). Prior to the
  Effective Time, Parent shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to
  obtain all regulatory approvals needed to ensure that the Parent Common
  Stock to be issued in the Merger will be registered or qualified under the
  securities law of every jurisdiction in the United States in which any
  registered holder of Company Common Stock has an address of record on the
  record date for determining the stockholders entitled to notice of and to
  vote at the Company Stockholders' Meeting; provided that Parent shall not
  be required to consent to the service of process in any jurisdiction in
  which it is not so subject. Each of Company and Parent will notify the
  other promptly upon the receipt of any comments from the SEC or its staff
  or any other government officials of the receipt of notice that the S-4 has
  become effective, of the issuance of any stop order, of the suspension of
  the qualification of the Parent Common Stock issuable in connection with
  the Merger for offering or sale in any jurisdiction, or of any request by
  the SEC or its staff or any other government officials for amendments or
  supplements to the S-4, the Proxy Statement/Prospectus or any Other Filing
  or for additional information and, except as may be prohibited by any
  Governmental Entity or

                                      A-25

  by any law applicable to such party, will supply the other with copies of
  all correspondence between such party or any of its representatives, on the
  one hand, and the SEC or its staff or any other government officials, on
  the other hand, with respect to the S-4, the Proxy Statement/Prospectus,
  the Merger or any Other Filing. Each of Company and Parent will cause all
  documents that it is responsible for filing with the SEC or other
  regulatory authorities under this Section 5.2(a) to comply in all material
  respects with all applicable requirements of law and the rules and
  regulations promulgated thereunder.

     (b) The Proxy Statement/Prospectus shall (i) solicit the approval of
  this Agreement and the Merger and include the recommendation of the Board
  of Directors of Company to Company's stockholders that they vote in favor
  of approval of this Agreement and the Merger, subject to the right of the
  Board of Directors of the Company to withdraw its recommendation pursuant
  to Section 5.2(c) of this Agreement, and (ii) include the opinion of
  Salomon Smith Barney, Inc. referred to in Section 2.20; provided, however,
  that the Board of Directors of Company shall submit this Agreement to
  Company's stockholders whether or not at any time subsequent to the date
  hereof such board determines that it can no longer make such
  recommendation.

     (c) Each of Parent and Company shall promptly inform the other of any
  event which is required to be set forth in an amendment or supplement to
  the Proxy Statement/Prospectus, the S-4 or any Other Filing and each of
  Parent and Company shall amend or supplement the Proxy Statement/Prospectus
  to the extent required by law to do so. No amendment or supplement to the
  Proxy Statement/Prospectus or the S-4 shall be made without the approval of
  Parent and Company, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld or
  delayed.

   5.2 Stockholder Meetings.

     (a) Company shall call and hold the Company Stockholders' Meeting as
  promptly as practicable after the date hereof for the purpose of voting
  upon the approval of this Agreement and the Merger, pursuant to the Proxy
  Statement/Prospectus. Nothing herein shall prevent Company from adjourning
  or postponing the Company Stockholders' Meeting if there are insufficient
  shares of Company Common Stock necessary to conduct business at its meeting
  of the stockholders. Unless Company's Board of Directors has withdrawn its
  recommendation of this Agreement and the Merger in compliance with Section
  5.2(c), Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to solicit from
  its stockholders proxies in favor of the approval of this Agreement and the
  Merger pursuant to the Proxy Statement/Prospectus. Company's obligation to
  call, give notice of, convene and hold the Company Stockholders' Meeting in
  accordance with this Section 5.2(a) shall not be limited to or otherwise
  affected by the commencement, disclosure, announcement or submission to
  Company of any Acquisition Proposal or any change in the Board of Directors
  recommendation regarding the Merger.

     (b) Subject to Section 5.2(c): (i) the Board of Directors of Company
  shall recommend that Company's stockholders vote in favor of and adopt and
  approve this Agreement and the Merger at the Company Stockholders' Meeting;
  (ii) the Proxy Statement/Prospectus shall include a statement to the effect
  that the Board of Directors of Company has recommended that Company's
  stockholders vote in favor of and adopt and approve this Agreement and the
  Merger at the Company Stockholders' Meeting; and (iii) neither the Board of
  Directors of Company nor any committee thereof shall withdraw, amend or
  modify, or propose or resolve to withdraw, amend or modify in a manner
  adverse to Parent, the recommendation of the Board of Directors of Company
  that Company's stockholders vote in favor of and adopt and approve this
  Agreement and the Merger.

     (c) Nothing in this Agreement shall prevent the Board of Directors of
  Company from withholding, withdrawing, amending or modifying its
  recommendation in favor of the Merger if the Board of Directors of Company
  reasonably concludes in good faith, after consultation with its outside
  counsel, that the failure to withhold, withdraw, amend or modify such
  recommendation would be inconsistent with its fiduciary obligations under
  applicable law. Nothing contained in this Section 5.2 shall limit Company's
  obligation to hold and convene the Company Stockholders' Meeting
  (regardless of whether the recommendation of the Board of Directors of
  Company shall have been withdrawn, amended or modified).

                                      A-26

   5.3 Confidentiality; Access to Information.

     (a) Confidentiality Agreement. The parties acknowledge that Company and
  Parent have previously executed Confidentiality Agreements, each dated as
  of March 1, 2001 (the "Confidentiality Agreements"), which Confidentiality
  Agreements will continue in full force and effect in accordance with their
  respective terms.

     (b) Access to Information. Each of Company and Parent will afford the
  other and the other's accountants, counsel and other representatives
  reasonable access during normal business hours, upon reasonable notice, to
  its properties, books, records and personnel during the period prior to the
  Effective Time to obtain all information concerning its business, including
  the status of product development efforts, properties, results of
  operations and personnel, as the other may reasonably request. No
  information or knowledge obtained by Company or Parent in any investigation
  pursuant to this Section 5.3 will affect or be deemed to modify any
  representation or warranty contained herein or the conditions to the
  obligations of the parties to consummate the Merger.

   5.4 No Solicitation.

     (a) From and after the date of this Agreement until the Effective Time
  or termination of this Agreement pursuant to Article VII, Company and its
  subsidiaries will not, nor will they authorize or permit any of their
  respective officers, directors, affiliates or employees or any investment
  banker, attorney or other advisor or representative retained by any of them
  to, directly or indirectly (i) solicit, initiate, encourage or induce the
  making, submission or announcement of any Acquisition Proposal (as defined
  below), (ii) participate in any discussions or negotiations regarding, or
  furnish to any person any non-public information with respect to, or take
  any other action to facilitate any inquiries or the making of any proposal
  that constitutes or may reasonably be expected to lead to, any Acquisition
  Proposal, (iii) engage in discussions with any person with respect to any
  Acquisition Proposal, (iv) approve, endorse or recommend any Acquisition
  Proposal or (v) enter into any letter of intent or similar document or any
  contract, agreement or commitment contemplating or otherwise relating to
  any Acquisition Transaction (as defined below); provided, however, this
  Section 5.4(a) shall not prohibit Company from (A) furnishing information
  regarding Company and its subsidiaries to, entering into a confidentiality
  agreement with or entering into discussions with, any person or group in
  response to a Superior Offer submitted by such person or group (and not
  withdrawn) if (1) neither Company nor any representative of Company and its
  subsidiaries shall have violated any of the restrictions set forth in this
  Section 5.4, (2) the Board of Directors of Company concludes in good faith,
  after consultation with its outside legal counsel, that the failure to take
  such action would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under
  applicable law, (3) (x) at least two business days prior to furnishing any
  such nonpublic information to, or entering into discussions or negotiations
  with, such person or group, Company gives Parent written notice of the
  identity of such person or group and of Company's intention to furnish
  nonpublic information to, or enter into discussions or negotiations with,
  such person or group and (y) Company receives from such person or group an
  executed confidentiality agreement containing customary limitations on the
  use and disclosure of all written and oral information furnished to such
  person or group by or on behalf of Company, and (4) contemporaneously with
  furnishing such information to any such person or group, Company furnishes
  such information to Parent (to the extent such information has not been
  previously furnished by Company to Parent) (B) approving, endorsing or
  recommending any Superior Offer in the event that (i) a Superior Offer (as
  defined below) is made to Company and not withdrawn, (ii) neither Company
  nor any of its representatives shall have violated any of the restrictions
  set forth in this Section 5.4 with respect to such Superior Offer, and
  (iii) the Board of Directors of Company reasonably concludes in good faith,
  after consultation with its outside counsel, that the failure, in light of
  such Superior Offer, to withhold, withdraw, amend or modify such
  recommendation would be inconsistent with its fiduciary obligations under
  applicable law or (C) complying with Rule 14e-2 promulgated under the
  Exchange Act with regard to an Acquisition Proposal with respect to which
  no violation of this Section 5.4 shall have occurred. Company and its
  subsidiaries will immediately cease any and all existing activities,
  discussions or

                                      A-27

  negotiations with any parties conducted heretofore with respect to any
  Acquisition Proposal. Without limiting the foregoing, it is understood that
  any violation of the restrictions set forth in the preceding two sentences
  by any officer or director of Company or any of its subsidiaries or any
  investment banker, attorney or other advisor or representative of Company
  or any of its subsidiaries shall be deemed to be a violation of this
  Section 5.4 by Company. In addition to the foregoing, Company shall (i)
  provide Parent with at least forty-eight (48) hours prior notice (or such
  lesser prior notice as provided to the members of Company's Board of
  Directors) of any meeting of Company's Board of Directors at which
  Company's Board of Directors is reasonably expected to consider a Superior
  Offer together with the material terms of such Superior Offer (including
  the identity of the offeror) and (ii) provide Parent with at least three
  (3) business days prior written notice (or such lesser prior notice as
  provided to the members of Company's Board of Directors) of a meeting of
  Company's Board of Directors at which Company's Board of Directors is
  reasonably expected to recommend a Superior Offer to its stockholders and
  together with such notice a copy of the definitive documentation relating
  to such Superior Offer.

   For purposes of this Agreement, "Superior Offer" shall mean an unsolicited,
bona fide written offer made by a third party to consummate any of the
following transactions: (i) a merger, consolidation, business combination,
recapitalization, liquidation, dissolution or similar transaction involving
Company pursuant to which the stockholders of Company immediately preceding
such transaction hold less than 51% of the equity interest in the surviving or
resulting entity of such transaction; (ii) a sale or other disposition by
Company of all or substantially all of its assets, or (iii) the acquisition by
any person or group (including by way of a tender offer or an exchange offer or
issuance by Company), directly or indirectly, of beneficial ownership or a
right to acquire beneficial ownership of shares representing in excess of 51%
of the voting power of the then outstanding shares of capital stock of Company,
in each case on terms that the Board of Directors of Company determines, in its
reasonable judgment (based on advice of its outside financial advisor) to be
more favorable to Company's stockholders than the terms of the Merger;
provided, however, that any such offer shall not be deemed to be a "Superior
Offer" if any financing required to consummate the transaction contemplated by
such offer is not committed or is not likely in the good faith judgment of
Company's Board of Directors (after consultation with its outside financial
advisor) to be obtained by such third party on a timely basis.

   For purposes of this Agreement, "Acquisition Proposal" shall mean any offer
or proposal (other than an offer or proposal by Parent) relating to any
Acquisition Transaction. For the purposes of this Agreement, "Acquisition
Transaction" shall mean any transaction or series of related transactions other
than the transactions contemplated by this Agreement involving: (A) any
acquisition or purchase from Company by any person or "group" (as defined under
Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations thereunder) of
more than a 15% interest in the total outstanding voting securities of Company
or any of its subsidiaries or any tender offer or exchange offer that if
consummated would result in any person or "group" (as defined under Section
13(d) of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations thereunder)
beneficially owning 15% or more of the total outstanding voting securities of
Company or any of its subsidiaries or any merger, consolidation, business
combination or similar transaction involving Company pursuant to which the
stockholders of Company immediately preceding such transaction hold less than
85% of the equity interests in the surviving or resulting entity of such
transaction; (B) any sale, lease (other than in the ordinary course of
business), exchange, transfer, license (other than in the ordinary course of
business), acquisition or disposition of more than 15% of the assets of
Company; or (C) any liquidation or dissolution of Company.

     (b) In addition to the obligations of Company set forth in paragraph (a)
  of this Section 5.4, Company as promptly as practicable shall advise Parent
  orally and in writing of any request received by Company for nonpublic
  information which Company reasonably believes would lead to an Acquisition
  Proposal or of any Acquisition Proposal, or any inquiry received by Company
  with respect to, or which Company reasonably believes would lead to any
  Acquisition Proposal, the material terms and conditions of such request,
  Acquisition Proposal or inquiry, and the identity of the person or group
  making any such request, Acquisition Proposal or inquiry. Company will keep
  Parent informed in all material respects of the status and details
  (including material amendments or proposed amendments) of any such request,
  Acquisition Proposal or inquiry.

                                      A-28

   5.5 Public Disclosure. Parent and Company will consult with each other, and
to the extent practicable, agree, before issuing any press release or otherwise
making any public statement with respect to the Merger, this Agreement or an
Acquisition Proposal and will not issue any such press release or make any such
public statement prior to such consultation, except as may be required by law
or any listing agreement with a national securities exchange or Nasdaq, in
which case reasonable efforts to consult with the other party will be made
prior to such release or public statement. The parties have agreed to the text
of the joint press release announcing the signing of this Agreement.

   5.6 Commercially Reasonable Efforts; Notification.

     (a) Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this
  Agreement, each of the parties agrees to use commercially reasonable
  efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and to do, or cause to
  be done, and to assist and cooperate with the other parties in doing, all
  things necessary, proper or advisable to consummate and make effective, in
  the most expeditious manner practicable, the Merger and the other
  transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including to accomplish the
  following: (i) causing the conditions precedent set forth in Article VI to
  be satisfied; (ii) obtaining all necessary actions or nonactions, waivers,
  consents, approvals, orders and authorizations from Governmental Entities;
  (iii) making all necessary registrations, declarations and filings
  (including registrations, declarations and filings with Governmental
  Entities, if any); (iv) avoiding any suit, claim, action, investigation or
  proceeding by any Governmental Entity challenging the Merger or any other
  transaction contemplated by this Agreement; (v) obtaining all consents,
  approvals or waivers from third parties required as a result of the
  transactions contemplated in this Agreement; (vi) defending any suits,
  claims, actions, investigations or proceedings, whether judicial or
  administrative, challenging this Agreement or the consummation of the
  transactions contemplated hereby, including seeking to have any stay or
  temporary restraining order entered by any court or other Governmental
  Entity vacated or reversed; (vii) executing or delivering any additional
  instruments reasonably necessary to consummate the transactions
  contemplated by, and to fully carry out the purposes of, this Agreement and
  (viii) to cause the Merger to qualify as a "reorganization" under Section
  368(a) of the Code. In connection with and without limiting the foregoing,
  subject to the other terms and conditions hereof, Company and its Board of
  Directors shall, if any state takeover statute or similar statute or
  regulation is or becomes applicable to the Merger, this Agreement or any of
  the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, use commercially
  reasonable efforts to ensure that the Merger and the other transactions
  contemplated by this Agreement may be consummated as promptly as
  practicable on the terms contemplated by this Agreement and otherwise to
  minimize the effect of such statute or regulation on the Merger, this
  Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby.

     (b) Company shall give prompt notice to Parent upon becoming aware that
  any representation or warranty made by it contained in this Agreement has
  become untrue or inaccurate, or of any failure of Company to comply with or
  satisfy in any material respect any covenant, condition or agreement to be
  complied with or satisfied by it under this Agreement, in each case, where
  the conditions set forth in Section 6.3(a) or Section 6.3(b) would not be
  satisfied as a result thereof; provided, however, that no such notification
  shall affect the representations, warranties, covenants or agreements of
  the parties or the conditions to the obligations of the parties under this
  Agreement.

     (c) Parent shall give prompt notice to Company upon becoming aware that
  any representation or warranty made by it or Merger Sub contained in this
  Agreement has become untrue or inaccurate, or of any failure of Parent or
  Merger Sub to comply with or satisfy in any material respect any covenant,
  condition or agreement to be complied with or satisfied by it under this
  Agreement, in each case, where the conditions set forth in Section 6.2(a)
  or Section 6.2(b) would not be satisfied as a result thereof; provided,
  however, that no such notification shall affect the representations,
  warranties, covenants or agreements of the parties or the conditions to the
  obligations of the parties under this Agreement.

   5.7 Third Party Consents. As soon as practicable following the date hereof,
Parent and Company will each use its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain
any consents, waivers and approvals under any of its or its subsidiaries'
respective material agreements, contracts, licenses or leases required to be
obtained in

                                      A-29

connection with the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby and
necessary to enable the business of Company or Parent, as the case may be, to
be operated following the Closing in substantially the same matter as currently
conducted.

   5.8 [Intentionally left blank.]

   5.9 Stock Options; Employee Benefits.

     (a) Stock Options. At the Effective Time, each outstanding option to
  purchase shares of Company Common Stock (each, a "Company Stock Option")
  under the Company Option Plans, whether or not vested, shall be assumed by
  Parent. Each Company Stock Option so assumed by Parent under this Agreement
  will continue to have, and be subject to, the same terms and conditions of
  such Company Stock Options immediately prior to the Effective Time
  (including, without limitation, any repurchase rights or vesting provisions
  and provisions regarding the acceleration of vesting on certain
  transactions, other than the transactions contemplated by this Agreement),
  except that (i) each Company Stock Option will be exercisable (or will
  become exercisable in accordance with its terms) for that number of whole
  shares of Parent Common Stock equal to the product of the number of shares
  of Company Common Stock that were issuable upon exercise of such Company
  Stock Option immediately prior to the Effective Time multiplied by the
  Exchange Ratio, rounded down to the nearest whole number of shares of
  Parent Common Stock and (ii) the per share exercise price for the shares of
  Parent Common Stock issuable upon exercise of such assumed Company Stock
  Option will be equal to the quotient determined by dividing the exercise
  price per share of Company Common Stock at which such Company Stock Option
  was exercisable immediately prior to the Effective Time by the Exchange
  Ratio, rounded up to the nearest whole cent. Parent shall comply with the
  terms of all such Company Stock Options and use its best efforts to ensure,
  to the extent required by and subject to the provisions of, the Company
  Option Plans, and to the extent permitted under the Code, that any Company
  Stock Options that qualified for tax treatment as incentive stock options
  under Section 422 of the Code prior to the Effective Time continue to so
  qualify after the Effective Time. Parent shall take all corporate actions
  necessary to reserve for issuance a sufficient number of shares of Parent
  Common Stock for delivery upon exercise of assumed Company Stock Options on
  the terms set forth in this Section 5.8(a). As soon as practicable after
  the Effective Time, Parent shall deliver to each holder of a Company Stock
