JOINT PROXY STATEMENT/ PROSPECTUS

MERGER PROPOSED  YOUR VOTE IS VERY IMPORTANT.

Dear Fellow Shareholders:

The boards of directors of Kent Electronics Corporation and
Avnet, Inc. have both called special meetings of their
shareholders for
               ,
 2001, at which we will ask you to consider and to vote upon an
agreement and plan of merger dated as of March 21, 2001,
providing for the merger of Alpha Acquisition Corp., a
wholly-owned subsidiary of Avnet, into Kent. As a result of this
merger, Kent will become a wholly-owned subsidiary of Avnet, and
holders of Kent common stock will receive, in exchange for each
share they hold, 0.87 of a share of the common stock of Avnet.
Avnet will issue only full shares to Kent shareholders; it will
settle fractional share interests in cash. We estimate that
Avnet will issue about 24,915,000 shares of Avnet common stock
in the merger to the holders of currently outstanding shares of
Kent common stock, which will represent about 21.2% of the
outstanding Avnet common stock following the merger. Each share
of Avnet common stock outstanding before the merger will remain
outstanding and will not be changed by the merger. The merger
will be tax-free to Avnet shareholders, and to Kent shareholders
except to the extent they receive cash instead of fractional
Avnet shares.

The Avnet common stock is listed for trading on the New York
Stock Exchange and the Pacific Exchange under the symbol
AVT. On
            ,
 2001, the closing price of an Avnet common share for New York
Stock Exchange composite transactions was
$          .

Your vote is very important. We cannot proceed with the merger
unless the shareholders of both companies approve the merger
agreement. You are cordially invited to attend your
shareholders special meeting. Whether or not you plan to
attend, please complete and mail the enclosed proxy card to us
or, if you are an Avnet shareholder, you may provide your voting
instructions by telephone or through the Internet in accordance
with the instructions on the Avnet proxy card. If your shares
are held of record in street name by a broker, bank
or other nominee, follow the voting instructions that you
receive from the nominee.

If you are a Kent shareholder and do not return your proxy
card or instruct your broker nominee how to vote your shares
held of record in the brokers name, you will in effect be
voting against the merger agreement.

The dates, times and places of the special meetings are as
follows:

QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS ABOUT THE MERGER

Q:

Who are the parties to this merger?

A:

	Alpha Acquisition Corp., a wholly-owned subsidiary of Avnet,
	Inc., will merge into Kent Electronics Corporation and cease to
	exist. Kent will remain as the surviving corporation after the
	merger and will be a wholly-owned subsidiary of Avnet.

Q:

What will Kent shareholders receive?

A:

	Holders of Kent common stock will receive 0.87 of a share of
	Avnet common stock for each share of Kent common stock, plus
	cash instead of any fractional Avnet share.

Q:

How many Kent shares will be converted into Avnet shares?

A:

	28,637,204 currently outstanding shares of Kent common stock
	will be converted into about 24,915,000 shares of Avnet common
	stock in the merger, which shares will represent about 21.2% of
	the outstanding common stock of Avnet following the merger.
	Also, a maximum of 2,352,221 additional shares of Kent common
	stock could be issued before the merger upon exercise of
	warrants and employee and director stock options and would if so
	issued also be converted into shares of Avnet common stock.

Q:

What should I do?

A:

	If you are a record holder of Avnet common stock or Kent common
	stock, after you have carefully read this proxy
	statement/prospectus, please sign, date and complete your proxy
	card and send it to us in the enclosed envelope or, if you are
	an Avnet shareholder, you may submit your voting instructions by
	telephone or the Internet in accordance with the instructions on
	or with the accompanying Avnet proxy card.

Q:

If my shares are held of record in street name by
	my broker, will my broker vote my shares for me?

A:

	If your shares of Avnet common stock or Kent common stock are
	held of record in street name by a broker, bank or
	other nominee, follow the voting instructions that you receive
	from the nominee. Your broker nominee will not be able to vote
	your shares without instructions from you. Your failure to
	instruct your broker nominee to vote your Kent shares will have
	the same effect as your voting against the merger agreement.
	Your failure to instruct your broker nominee to vote your Avnet
	shares will not affect the outcome of the vote at the Avnet
	special meeting.

Q:  Can I change my vote after I have submitted my
proxy with voting instructions?

A:

	Yes. If you are a record holder of Avnet common stock or Kent
	common stock, there are three ways in which you may revoke your
	proxy and change your vote at any time before the appropriate
	meeting:

 

	You may send a written notice that you are revoking your Kent
	proxy to the Corporate Secretary of Kent at 1111 Gillingham
	Lane, Sugar Land, Texas 77478 in time for it to be received
	before the Kent special meeting, or written notice that you are
	revoking your Avnet proxy to the Corporate Secretary of Avnet at
	2211 South 47th Street, Phoenix, Arizona 85034, in time for it
	to be received before the Avnet special meeting.

 

	You may complete and submit a new proxy card by mail or, in the
	case of Avnet only, submit your proxy with new voting
	instructions by telephone. The latest dated proxy actually
	submitted before the Avnet or Kent special meeting will be
	recorded and any earlier votes will be automatically revoked.

 

	You may attend the special meeting of your company and vote in
	person. However, simply attending the special meeting without
	voting will not revoke a proxy you previously submitted.

	If your shares of Avnet common stock or Kent common stock are
	held of record in street name by a broker, bank, or other
	nominee, you must follow directions you receive from the nominee
	to change or revoke your voting instructions.

Q:  Should I send in my Kent stock certificates or
Avnet stock certificates now?

A:

	No. After the merger has been completed, Kent shareholders
	will receive written instructions for exchanging their Kent
	stock certificates for Avnet stock certificates. Please do not
	send in your stock certificates with your proxy card. Avnet
	shareholders will not need to exchange their stock certificates
	after the merger, since the certificates representing Avnet
	common stock outstanding before the merger will represent the
	same shares of Avnet common stock after the merger.

Q:  Will the merger be completed if shareholders of
Kent or Avnet do not approve it?

A:

	No. The merger agreement must be approved by the
	shareholders of both companies. Otherwise, it will not be
	completed.

Q:

Will the shares of Avnet common stock issued in the merger be
	listed for trading?

Yes. The Avnet common stock is currently listed on the New York
Stock Exchange and the Pacific Exchange under the symbol
AVT. After the merger, the Avnet common stock
(including the shares issued in the merger) will continue to be
listed on both exchanges.

Q:

Whom should Kent and Avnet shareholders call with
	questions?

A:

	Kent shareholders should call Stephen J. Chapko, Secretary
	of Kent, at (281)  243-4000. Avnet shareholders should call
	Raymond Sadowski, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial
	Officer at Avnet, at (480) 643-2000.

The Merger

We are proposing a merger in which Alpha Acquisition Corp., a
wholly-owned subsidiary of Avnet, will merge into Kent and will
cease to exist. Kent will remain as the surviving corporation
after the merger and will be a wholly-owned subsidiary of Avnet.

After the merger, persons who were Avnet shareholders before the
merger will own approximately 78.8% of the outstanding shares of
Avnet common stock, and Kent shareholders will own approximately
21.2% of the outstanding shares of Avnet common stock.

What Kent Shareholders Will Receive (page 57)

Under the merger agreement, each share of Kent common stock
would be converted into the right to receive 0.87 of a share of
Avnet common stock. Kent shareholders will receive cash in lieu
of fractional Avnet shares.

Recommendation to Shareholders (pages 37 and 39)

The boards of directors of Kent and Avnet have separately
concluded that the merger is fair to and in the best interests
of their respective shareholders, and unanimously recommend that
their shareholders vote FOR approval of the merger agreement.

Credit Suisse First Boston Corporation, financial advisor to
Kent, delivered an opinion dated March 21, 2001, to the
board of directors of Kent as to the fairness of the exchange
ratio in the merger to the holders of Kent common stock from a
financial point of view. The full text of the opinion of Credit
Suisse First Boston is attached as Appendix D to this proxy
statement/ prospectus. You should read it carefully in its
entirety to

understand the procedures followed, assumptions made, matters
considered and limitations on the review undertaken by Credit
Suisse First Boston in providing its opinion. 
Credit Suisse
First Bostons opinion is addressed to the board of
directors of Kent and does not constitute a recommendation to
any shareholder as to any matter relating to the merger.

Avnets financial advisor, has rendered a written opinion,
dated March 21, 2001, to the Avnet board of directors as to
the fairness, from a financial point of view, to Avnet of the
exchange ratio in the merger. The full text of the written
opinion of Merrill Lynch is attached to this proxy
statement/prospectus as Appendix E. We encourage you to
read the opinion carefully in its entirety to understand the
procedures followed, assumptions made, matters considered and
limitations on the review undertaken by Merrill Lynch in
providing its opinion. 
The opinion of Merrill Lynch is
addressed to the Avnet board of directors and does not
constitute a recommendation to any shareholder with respect to
any matter relating to the merger.

Interests of Certain Persons in the Merger and Possible
Conflicts of Interest (page 49)

In considering the recommendation of the Kent board of directors
that the merger agreement be adopted, Kent shareholders should
be aware that a number of Kent executive officers and directors
have interests in the merger that are, or may be, different from
the interests of other Kent shareholders. They include the
following:

 

	Morrie K. Abramson, the chairman of the board and a co-founder
	of Kent and, until June 29, 2000, its chief executive
	officer, retired as an employee on March 31, 2001, and
	pursuant to his employment agreement with Kent, effective
	April 1, 2001, he began to receive an annual retirement
	benefit of $852,000 per year, subject to future annual cost of
	living adjustments. This benefit is payable until the last to
	occur of April 1, 2016, his death and the death of his
	wife. Concurrently with the closing of the merger, Kent will
	discharge its obligation to pay this retirement cash benefit by
	paying to Mr. Abramson a lump sum of $25,068,000, less the
	value of monthly payments of the retirement benefit paid from
	April 1, 2001, through the closing of the merger.

 

	Mr. Abramson also has a consulting agreement with Kent
	which provides that upon its termination, he will become
	entitled to receive a cash annuity of $250,000 per year, subject
	to future annual cost of living adjustments. This annuity will
	be payable until the last to occur of fifteen years, his death
	or the death of his wife. The consulting agreement also provides
	for a change in control payment to Mr. Abramson equal to
	five times his highest recent annual cash compensation. The
	consulting agreement will be terminated in connection with the
	merger, and in accordance with the early termination provisions
	of the consulting agreement, Kent will pay Mr. Abramson a
	lump sum amount estimated at $29,000,000 in settlement of the
	above cash annuity and change in control payment.
	Mr. Abramson will also receive additional payments to the
	extent necessary to hold him harmless from the effects of any
	federal excise taxes imposed on golden parachute
	payments.

 

	The merger will be a change in control of Kent as defined in the
	severance agreements it has with six other executive officers.
	As a result, the merger agreement permits Kent to pay them,
	concurrently with the closing of the merger, cash amounts equal
	to one or two times their highest recent annual cash
	compensation. In addition, all their unvested employee stock
	options will immediately vest if their employment with Avnet is
	terminated for any reason, with or without cause.

 

	Avnet has entered into two-year employment agreements, effective
	as of the effective time of the merger, with Larry D.
	Olson, Kents chief executive officer and president, and
	Mark A. Zerbe, an executive vice president of Kent, which
	agreements provide for annual salary and incentive compensation
	aggregating not less than $600,000 for Mr. Olson and
	$450,000 for Mr. Zerbe.

 

	Upon completion of the merger, Avnet will assume Kents
	obligations under Kents employee and director stock option
	plans, so that the outstanding Kent options will become options
	to purchase Avnet shares in a number and at an exercise price
	adjusted to reflect the exchange ratio for the merger.

 

	Avnet has agreed to indemnify Kents past and present
	directors and officers to the fullest extent permitted by Texas
	law for serving in their capacities as such, and has agreed to
	maintain their directors and officers liability
	insurance coverage for six years following the merger.

The Kent Special Meeting

Time, Place and Matters to Be Voted Upon
(page 19)

The special meeting of Kent shareholders will be held on
            ,
 2001, at 10:00 a.m., Houston time, at Chase Tower,
600 Travis Street, Suite 2500, Houston, Texas 77002.
At the Kent special meeting, its shareholders will be asked to
approve and adopt the Merger Agreement. No other business may be
brought at the Kent special meeting.

Record Date and Vote Required
(page 19)

You may cast one vote for each share of Kent common stock that
you owned at the close of business on
            ,
 2001, the record date for the Kent special meeting. Approval of
the merger agreement requires two-thirds of the votes
represented by all shares of Kent common stock outstanding on
the Kent record date.

As of the Kent record date, directors and executive officers of
Kent owned an aggregate of 679,175 issued and outstanding shares
of Kent common stock over which they had or shared the power to
vote, representing in the aggregate approximately 2.4% of the
votes which may be cast at the Kent special meeting. All the
directors and executive officers of Kent have advised Kent that
they intend to vote all these shares for approval of the merger
agreement. In addition, an aggregate of five directors and
executive officers of Kent have granted to Avnet irrevocable
proxies to vote an aggregate of 592,250 shares, representing
approximately 2.1% of the votes which may be cast at the Kent
special meeting, for approval of the merger agreement. See
Other Agreements  Inducement Agreements
(page 69).

The Avnet Special Meeting

Time, Place and Matters to Be Voted Upon
(page 22)

The special meeting of Avnet shareholders will be held on
            ,
 2001, at 10:00 a.m., local time, at
               .
 At the Avnet special meeting, its shareholders will be asked to
approve the Merger Agreement. Other business may be brought at
the Avnet special meeting only if it relates to the merger
proposal.

Record Date and Vote Required
(page 22)

You may cast one vote for each share of Avnet common stock that
you owned at the close of business on
            ,
 2001, the record date for the Avnet special meeting. Approval
of the merger agreement requires the affirmative vote of a
majority of the total votes cast on the proposal, so long as the
total votes cast represent over 50% of the shares of Avnet
common stock outstanding on the Avnet record date.

On [record date] there were
           shares
 of Avnet common stock outstanding and entitled to vote. As of
the record date, all directors and officers of Avnet
beneficially owned an aggregate of
           outstanding
 shares of Avnet common stock (not including shares issuable
upon exercise of stock options), which entitle them to cast
approximately      % of all votes which
may be cast at the Avnet special meeting. Each executive officer
and director has advised Avnet that he or she will vote all of
his or her shares in favor of the approval of the merger
agreement.

Regulatory Matters (page 54)

We furnished information and materials concerning Avnet, Kent
and the proposed merger to the Antitrust Division of the
Department of Justice and the Federal Trade Commission under the
Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, and the
required waiting period will terminate at 11:59 p.m. on
May 10, 2001, unless terminated on an earlier date by the
Antitrust Division or the FTC, or unless before May 11,
2001, either of them requests additional information. However,
the Antitrust Division of the

Department of Justice and the FTC still have the power to
challenge the merger on antitrust grounds before or after the
merger is completed. No other material federal or state
regulatory requirements remain to be complied with, and no other
federal or state regulatory approval must be obtained, in
connection with the merger.

Material Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger
(page 70)

No gain or loss will be recognized for federal income tax
purposes by Avnet shareholders and Kent shareholders with
respect to the merger, except that a Kent shareholder who
receives cash in lieu of a fractional Avnet share will recognize
gain to the extent the cash received exceeds the Kent
shareholders adjusted tax basis in the Kent common stock
allocable to such fractional share.

Avnet and Kent have conditioned the merger on their receipt of a
legal opinion that the merger will be treated for federal income
tax purposes as a reorganization within the meaning
of Section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as
amended. Avnet and Kent could choose to waive receipt of this
legal opinion. However, if the receipt of the legal opinion is
waived and there is a material difference in the tax
consequences to you from what we have described in this
document, we will recirculate revised proxy materials and
solicit a second vote of shareholders.

This tax treatment may not apply to all Kent shareholders and
may depend on your specific situation and on variables not
within our control. We urge you to consult your own tax adviser
for a full understanding of the tax consequences of the
merger.

Comparison of Shareholders Rights (page 82)

The rights of Kent shareholders currently are governed by Texas
law and Kents articles of incorporation and by-laws. Kent
shareholders will receive Avnet common stock in the merger, and
their rights as Avnet shareholders will be governed by New York
law and Avnets certificate of incorporation and by-laws,
which differ in material respects from Texas law and Kents
articles of incorporation and by-laws.

Listing of Avnet Common Stock (page 54)

The Avnet common stock is listed on the New York Stock Exchange
and the Pacific Exchange under the symbol AVT. After
consummation of the merger, the Avnet common stock will continue
to be listed on these exchanges, including the shares of Avnet
common stock issuable in the merger.

No Dissenters Rights (page 54)

After the merger, the shareholders of Kent will not have any
right under Texas law, and the shareholders of Avnet will not
have any right under New York law, to receive payment in cash of
the judicially determined fair value of their shares.

Resales of Avnet Common Stock (page 55)

The shares of Avnet common stock to be issued in the merger have
been registered under the Securities Act of 1933 and therefore
may be resold without restriction by all former shareholders of
Kent who are not deemed to be affiliates of either
Avnet or Kent. An affiliate of Kent who receives shares of Avnet
common stock in the merger would be unable to resell such shares
in the absence of registration of such resales under the
Securities Act or the availability of an exemption from such
registration.

The Merger Agreement

The merger agreement is attached to this proxy statement/
prospectus as Appendix A. Please read the merger agreement
carefully and in its entirety. It is the legal document that
governs the merger.

Effective Time of the Merger (page 57)

The merger will become effective shortly after all the
conditions to the completion of the merger have been satisfied
or waived, when Avnet and Kent deliver articles of merger to the
Texas Secretary of State and the Secretary of State issues a
certificate of merger. Although we can give you no assurances,
we currently expect that the merger will be completed shortly
after the conclusion of the Kent and Avnet special meetings.

Conditions to the Merger (page 59)

The completion of the merger depends on a number of conditions
being satisfied or, where applicable, waived, including

 

	approval of the merger agreement by the shareholders of Kent and
	Avnet,

 

	receipt of required governmental approvals and the absence of
	governmental action seeking to prohibit, restrict or delay the
	merger,

 

	the continued accuracy in all material respects of the
	representations and warranties of Kent and Avnet in the merger
	agreement and compliance in all material respects by each of
	them with all its covenants under the merger agreement,

 

	receipt by Kent and Avnet of legal opinions confirming that the
	United States federal income tax treatment will be as described
	in this proxy statement/ prospectus, and

 

	the non-occurrence of any event having a material adverse effect
	on the business, financial condition or results of operations of
	Kent and Avnet.

Agreement Not to Solicit Other Acquisition Proposals
(page 62)

Kent has agreed that it will not solicit, initiate or take any
other action to facilitate knowingly any inquiries or the making
of any proposal which is or may reasonably be expected to lead
to an acquisition proposal, which is defined as a
proposal, other than the Avnet merger proposal, to acquire,
recapitalize or liquidate Kent, or sell all or substantially all
of Kents assets, or acquire at least 15% of any class of
equity securities of Kent or any of its subsidiaries. However,
Kent may engage in discussions with a person, who, without any
solicitation or encouragement by Kent, seeks to initiate such
discussions, may furnish such person nonpublic information
concerning Kent, and may accept an acquisition proposal from a
person other than Avnet, if the person has made a bona fide
acquisition proposal which the board of directors of Kent
believes in good faith (after consultation with its financial
advisor) is a superior proposal, meaning, in
general, that the proposal would, if consummated, result in a
transaction more favorable to the shareholders of Kent, from a
financial point of view, than the transactions contemplated by
the merger agreement with Avnet, and Kents board of
directors concludes in good faith that entering into discussions
and furnishing nonpublic information in connection with the
superior proposal, or accepting a superior proposal, may be
necessary for the board of directors to act in a manner
consistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable law.

Termination (page 64)

Avnet and Kent may together agree to terminate the merger
agreement at any time before completing the merger, even after
their shareholders have approved it.

Also, either Avnet or Kent may decide, without consent of the
other, to terminate the merger agreement if

 

	any court or other governmental entity has issued a final and
	non-appealable order prohibiting the merger, or

 

	the merger has not been completed by September 30, 2001,
	and the party seeking termination has not failed to perform or
	observe in any material respect any of its covenants and
	agreements in the merger agreement, or

 

	the Kent shareholders or the Avnet shareholders do not approve
	the merger agreement, or

 

	the other materially breaches any provision of the merger
	agreement in a manner that has or is likely to have a material
	adverse effect on the terminating party or that may reasonably
	be expected to prevent or materially delay the merger, and the
	terminating party itself is not in material breach of the merger
	agreement.

Kent may terminate the merger agreement without the consent of
Avnet

 

	if the Avnet board of directors withdraws, modifies or changes
	its approval or recommendation of the merger agreement or the
	merger in a manner adverse to Kent, or resolves to do so, or

 

	for the purpose of entering into an agreement for a
	superior proposal.

Avnet may terminate the merger agreement without the consent of
Kent if

 

	the board of directors of Kent withdraws, modifies or changes
	its approval or recommendation of the merger agreement in a
	manner adverse to Avnet, or resolves to do so, or

 

	the board of directors of Kent has approved or recommended a
	superior proposal or

 

	Kents board of directors without Avnets written
	consent redeems Kents preferred share purchase rights
	attached to the Kent common stock, or amends its shareholder
	rights plan, for any reason other than (1) to facilitate
	transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, or
	(2) following termination of the merger agreement for the
	purpose of entering into an agreement with a person that has
	made a superior proposal. See Description of
	Kent Capital Stock  Shareholder Rights Plan on
	page 80.

Fees and Expenses; Termination Fees (page 65)

In general, whether or not the merger is completed, Avnet and
Kent will each pay its own fees and expenses. However, Kent will
pay Avnet $1,000,000 in cash if either Avnet or Kent terminates
the merger agreement because the Kent shareholders do not
approve the merger agreement, and Avnet will pay Kent $1,000,000
in cash if either Avnet or Kent terminates the merger agreement
because the Avnet shareholders do not approve the merger
agreement.

Kent will also pay Avnet $30,000,000 in cash, less any previous
payment of $1,000,000 and any amounts that Avnet recovers from
Kent in litigation for a material breach by Kent of the merger
agreement, if

 

	Avnet terminates the merger agreement because the board of
	directors of Kent has withdrawn, modified or changed its
	approval or recommendation of the merger agreement or the merger
	in a manner adverse to Avnet, or has resolved to do so, or

 

	Avnet terminates the merger agreement because Kents board
	of directors has approved or recommended a superior
	proposal, or

 

	Avnet terminates the merger agreement because Kents board
	of directors has without Avnets written consent redeemed
	Kents preferred share purchase rights attached to the Kent
	common stock, or

	amended its shareholder rights plan, for any reason other than
	(1)  to facilitate the transactions contemplated by the
	merger agreement, or (2) following termination of the
	merger agreement by Kent for the purpose of entering into an
	agreement with a person that has made a superior proposal, or

 

	Kent terminates the merger agreement for the purpose of entering
	into an agreement with a person that has made a superior
	proposal, and within one year of the termination date,
	Kent consummates a transaction or series of transactions with
	the person submitting the superior proposal, or with any
	affiliate of that person, and in the transaction more than 50%
	of Kents common stock or a majority of Kents assets
	are transferred to such person or any of its affiliates, or

 

	any person successfully acquires more than 50% of Kents
	common stock, or Kent enters into an agreement with any person
	other than Avnet that has made or in the future makes an
	acquisition proposal, and consummates a transaction
	or series of transactions with that person or any of its
	affiliates that results in such persons owning more than
	50% of Kents common stock or a majority of Kents
	assets, if the transaction is consummated or the acquisition
	occurs within one year following termination of the merger
	agreement for specified reasons.

Avnet will also pay Kent $30,000,000, less any previous payment
of the $1,000,000 and any amounts that Kent recovers from Avnet
in litigation for a material breach by Avnet of the merger
agreement, if Kent terminates the merger agreement because the
board of directors of Avnet has withdrawn, modified or changed
its approval or recommendation of the merger agreement or the
merger in a manner adverse to Kent, or has resolved to do so.

Other Agreements (page 67)

At the same time as the merger agreement,

 

	Avnet and Kent entered into a stock option agreement under which
	Kent granted Avnet an option to purchase in certain
	circumstances up to 2,863,474 shares of Kent common stock,
	representing about 10% of the currently outstanding shares of
	Kent common stock, at an exercise price of $22.48 per share, and

 

	Avnet entered into inducement agreements with an aggregate of
	five directors and executive officers of Kent holding an
	aggregate of 592,250 shares of Kent common stock, representing
	about 2.1% of the currently outstanding shares of Kent common
	stock, in which those shareholders granted Avnet irrevocable
	proxies to vote their shares in favor of approval of the merger
	agreement and against other proposals to acquire Kent.

The stock option agreement is Appendix B attached to this
proxy statement/ prospectus, and the inducement agreements are
Appendices C-1 and C-2 attached to this proxy statement/
prospectus.

Summary Historical and Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Combined
Financial and Market Information

The following tables present selected data

 

	for Avnet and Kent on an historical basis,

 

	for Avnet and Kent on a pro forma basis giving effect to the
	merger, and

 

	for Kent common stock on a pro forma equivalent share basis,
	which is based on the merger exchange ratio of 0.87 of a share
	of Avnet common stock for each outstanding share of Kent common
	stock.

The following information is based upon the historical financial
statements of Avnet and Kent and the related notes incorporated
by reference into this proxy statement/ prospectus, and upon the
pro forma financial statements appearing elsewhere in this proxy
statement/ prospectus. You should read this information together
with such historical financial statements and related notes. The
information below does not necessarily indicate reliably the
results of the future operations of Avnet after the merger or
the actual results that would have occurred had the merger been
consummated before the periods indicated.

The management of Avnet and Kent expect that the merger will
qualify as a pooling-of-interests business
combination for accounting purposes. Under this method of
accounting, the historical cost basis of the assets and
liabilities of Avnet and Kent will be carried forward to the
combined company. Results of operations of the combined company
will include the income of Avnet and Kent for the entire fiscal
period in which the combination occurs. The results of
operations of the separate companies for fiscal years before the
merger will be combined and reported as the results of
operations of the combined company.

We have presented unaudited pro forma condensed combined
financial information that reflects the
pooling-of-interests method of accounting to provide
a better picture of what our businesses might have looked like
had they been combined as of and for the periods indicated. We
prepared the pro forma condensed combined statements of income
and balance sheet by combining the historical amounts of each
company and adjusting share information based upon an exchange
ratio of 0.87 of a share of Avnet for each share of Kent. Upon
initial review, it appears that the accounting policies of Avnet
and Kent are substantially comparable. Consequently, we did not
make adjustments to the unaudited pro forma condensed combined
financial information to conform the accounting policies of the
combining companies. Upon consummation of the merger, further
review of Kents accounting policies and financial
statements may require restatements of the combined
entitys financial statements to conform to those policies
and classifications that are deemed most appropriate.

The companies may have performed differently had they always
been combined. The unaudited pro forma condensed combined
financial information is not necessarily indicative of the
historical results that would have occurred had the companies
always been combined or the future results that the combined
company will experience after the merger. See Pro Forma
Financial Data on page 71.

Merger-Related Expenses

Avnet estimates that merger-related fees and expenses,
consisting primarily of fees and expenses of investment bankers,
attorneys and accountants, SEC filing fees, stock exchange
listing fees, and financial printing and other related charges,
will be approximately $12 million. The pro forma balance sheet
information reflects these estimated direct transaction costs.
These expenses have not been reflected in the pro forma
statement of income information as they are considered to be
nonrecurring.

Integration-Related Expenses and Synergy Benefits

Avnet expects to incur costs for integration-related expenses
necessary to reduce costs and operate efficiently. These costs
will be charged to operations subsequent to the merger and,
therefore, are not reflected in the unaudited pro forma
condensed combined financial information. In addition, the
unaudited pro forma

condensed combined statements of income exclude any benefit that
might result from the merger due to synergies that may be
derived from the elimination of any duplicate costs and other
productivity gains.

Periods Covered

The unaudited pro forma condensed combined statements of income
combine Avnets results for its fiscal years ended
June 30, 2000, July 2, 1999 and June 26, 1998
with Kents results for its fiscal years ended
April 1, 2000, April 3, 1999 and March 28, 1998
giving effect to the merger as if it had occurred on the first
day of Avnets fiscal year. As such, Kents period
from April 2, 2000 to June 30, 2000 has been omitted
from the pro forma condensed combined statements of income.
Kents sales, gross profit, income before income taxes and
net income for that period, excluding discontinued operations,
were approximately $223,313,000, $46,244,000, $9,863,000 and
$5,918,000, respectively. In addition, the unaudited interim pro
forma condensed combined statements of income combine
Avnets results for its first halves ended
December 29, 2000 and December 31, 1999 with
Kents results for its first halves ended
September 30, 2000 and October 2, 1999, giving effect
to the merger as if it had occurred on the first day of
Avnets fiscal periods. The unaudited pro forma condensed
combined balance sheet combines the balance sheets of Avnet as
of December 29, 2000 and Kent as of December 30, 2000,
giving effect to the merger as if it had occurred on
December 29, 2000.

Converted Share Information

The Kent pro forma per converted share information shows the
effect of the merger from the perspective of an owner of Kent
common shares. The information was computed by multiplying the
unrounded Avnet pro forma combined information by the merger
exchange ratio of 0.87.

(2) 

	A significant portion of the growth in Avnets operations
	and financial position in the first half ended December 29,
	2000 compared to the prior year period is a result of a number
	of factors including the acquisitions completed in fiscal 2000

	operations, including costs related to the consolidation of its
	European warehousing operations, and (d) costs incurred in
	connection with certain litigation brought by Avnet. The effect
	of these charges was to decrease income before taxes, net income
	and diluted earnings per share by $34.1 million, $21.6 million
	and $0.28, respectively.

	Includes special charges associated with: (a) the

	(c) the reorganization of Avnets Electronics
	Marketing Asia operations, (d) the reorganization of
	Avnets Electronics Marketing European operations,
	including costs related to the consolidation of its European

	of these charges for fiscal 2000 amounted to $49.0 million on
	income before income taxes, $30.4 million on net income and
	$0.37 per share on a diluted basis. Additionally, a significant
	portion of the growth in Avnets operations and financial

	recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal 1999 offset by special
	charges recorded in the first quarter associated with the
	reorganization of Avnets Electronics Marketing group. The
	net positive effect on fiscal 1999 income before income taxes,
	net income and diluted earnings per share was $183.0 million,
	$64.0 million, and $0.89, respectively.

(6) 

	Includes the net negative impact of $14.9 million on income
	before income taxes and $12.5 million on net income ($0.16 per

	and $17.2 million after-tax, (b) costs relating to the
	divestiture of Avnet Industrial, the closure of Avnets
	corporate headquarters in Great Neck, New York, and the
	anticipated loss on the sale of Avnet-owned real estate,
	amounting to $13.3 million pre-tax and $8.5 million after tax,
	and (c) incremental special charges associated with the
	reorganization of Avnets Electronics Marketing group,
	amounting to $35.4 million pre-tax and $21.2 million after-tax.

RISK FACTORS

You should carefully consider the risks described below and
the other information included in this proxy statement/
prospectus. If any of these risks actually occur, Avnets
business, results of operations and financial condition could be
materially adversely affected, the trading prices of
Avnets common stock could decline, and you could lose part
of your investment. See also Cautionary Statement
Regarding Forward-Looking Statements.

The exchange ratio for the Avnet common stock to be
distributed to Kent shareholders in the merger is fixed, and
therefore Kent shareholders cannot be sure of the market value
of the Avnet common stock that they will receive in the
merger.

Under the merger agreement, each share of Kent common stock will
be converted into a right to receive 0.87 of a share of Avnet
common stock. This exchange ratio is fixed and will not be
adjusted in the event of any change in the relative market
values of the Kent common stock and the Avnet common stock
before the effective time of the merger. Therefore, Kent
shareholders cannot be sure of the market value of the Avnet
common stock that they will receive in the merger.

The market prices of Avnet common stock and Kent common stock,
and the value of Avnet common stock relative to Kent common
stock, may be substantially different on the date the merger
agreement was signed, the date of this proxy statement/
prospectus, the date of the special meetings of the Kent and
Avnet shareholders to approve the merger agreement, and the
effective date of the merger. These market prices may vary
depending upon changes in the business, operations or prospects
of Kent and Avnet, market assessments of the likelihood that the
merger will be consummated and the timing thereof, general
market and economic conditions, and other factors both within
and beyond the control of Kent and Avnet. For example, since
April 1, 2000, the price of a share of Avnet common stock
has ranged from a low of $17.187 to a high of $40.563 (adjusted
for a two-for-one stock split on September 28, 2000), and
the closing price of a share of Kent common stock ranged from a
low of $13.50 to a high of $35.00. Further, because the
effective date of the merger may be later than the date of the
special meetings, the price of a share of Avnet common stock on
the date of the special meetings may not be the same as its
price on the date the merger is completed. For example, on
March 21, 2001, the day before the merger agreement was
publicly announced, the closing price of a share of Avnet common
stock for New York Stock Exchange composite transactions was
$23.55, so that the consideration offered in the agreement and
plan of merger per share of Kent common stock had a value on
that date of $23.55 x 0.87, or $20.49. However, if the market
value of shares of the Avnet common stock on the effective date
of the merger is less than $23.55, holders of Kent common stock
will receive shares of Avnet common stock in the merger with an
initial value less than $20.49 per share of Kent common stock.

Neither Kent nor Avnet may terminate the merger agreement solely
because of changes in the market price of the Avnet common stock
or the Kent common stock.

We urge Kent shareholders to obtain current market quotations
for Avnet common stock and Kent common stock.

Avnet may not realize fully the cost savings and other
benefits it expects to realize as a result of the merger. This
may adversely affect Avnets earnings and financial
condition.

Although Kent and Avnet expect significant benefits to result
from the merger, Avnet may not realize any of these anticipated
benefits. The merger involves the integration of two companies
that have previously operated independently. The value of Avnet
common stock following consummation of the merger may be
affected by the degree of success in achieving the benefits
expected to result from consummation of the merger. Achieving
these benefits will depend in part upon meeting the challenges
inherent in the successful combination of two business
enterprises of the size and scope of Kent and Avnet and upon the
possible resulting diversion of management attention for an
extended period of time. Challenges like these may not be met
and may negatively impact the operations of Avnet following the
merger. Delays encountered in the transition process could have
a material adverse effect upon the sales, level of expenses,
operating results and financial condition of Avnet. See
The Merger  Kents Reasons for the
Merger, and  Recommendation

of, and Factors Considered by, Kents Board of
Directors on pages 36 and 37 and The
Merger  Avnets Reasons for the Merger;
Recommendation of the Avnet Board of Directors on
page 39.

As a result of the merger, Avnet will assume Kents
obligations under $207,000,000 aggregate principal amount of
Kents 4.5% Convertible Subordinated Notes due 2004.

Under the indenture providing for these notes, the merger will
be a change in control and therefore will be a
repurchase event that will entitle each holder of
notes, at the holders option, to require Avnet to
repurchase all or a portion of such holders notes at a
price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the notes, plus
accrued and unpaid interest through the date of repurchase. Kent
will be required to give note holders notice within 15 days
after the occurrence of the repurchase event (that is, the
closing of the merger), and the note holders may exercise their
repurchase rights within 30 days after Kent gives the
required notice. If all note holders were to exercise their
repurchase right with respect to all of their notes, Avnet will
be required to pay to the holders $207,000,000, plus accrued and
unpaid interest through the date of repurchase. Given the low
rate of interest payable on the notes and the currently
unfavorable conversion price of the notes, it is likely that
many note holders will exercise their repurchase right. See
The Merger  Kents Convertible Notes
on page 53.

Directors and management of Kent have potential conflicts
of interest.

Morrie K. Abramson and Larry D. Olson, directors of
Kent who have recommended that Kent shareholders vote for
approval of the merger agreement, have substantial interests in
the merger that are in addition to those of Kent shareholders
generally, and other executive officers of Kent also have
interests that are in addition to those of Kent shareholders
generally, as described under The Merger 
Interests of Certain Persons in the Merger and Possible
Conflicts of Interest below. In addition, Kent directors
will be entitled under the merger agreement to the continuation
of their indemnification and insurance arrangements. Kent
shareholders should be aware of all these interests when they
consider the Kent boards recommendation that they vote in
favor of the merger.

After the merger, customers of Avnet may seek alternative
distributors.

After the merger some customers of both Avnet and Kent could
arrange to transfer their business to another distributor. We
cannot predict whether this will occur or to what extent.

After the merger, suppliers may terminate supply
agreements with Avnet or add other distributors.

Some suppliers of Avnet or Kent may terminate their supply
agreements with Avnet after the merger. Alternatively, some
other suppliers might consider adding additional distributors
for their products. We cannot predict whether this will occur or
to what extent.

The market price of the Avnet common stock may be affected
by factors different from those affecting the shares of Kent
common stock.

Upon completion of the merger, holders of Kent common stock will
become holders of Avnet common stock. Kents businesses
differ from those of Avnet and therefore the results of
operations of Avnet and Kent combined may be affected by factors
different from those currently affecting the results of
operations of Kent. For a discussion of the businesses of Kent
and Avnet and of certain factors to consider in connection with
those businesses, see the documents incorporated by reference in
this proxy statement/ prospectus and referred to under
Where You Can Find More Information.

CAUTIONARY STATEMENT REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS

This proxy statement/ prospectus contains forward-looking
statements with respect to the financial condition, results of
operations and business of each of Kent and Avnet. These
statements may be made directly in this proxy statement/
prospectus referring to Kent or Avnet, or may be made part of
this proxy statement/ prospectus by reference to other documents
filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission by Kent or
Avnet, which is known as incorporation by reference,
and may include statements for the period following the
consummation of the merger. You can find many of these
statements by looking for words like believes,
expects, anticipates,
estimates or similar expressions in this document or
in documents incorporated by reference.

These forward-looking statements are subject to numerous
assumptions, risks and uncertainties. Factors that may cause
actual results to differ materially from those contemplated by
the forward-looking statements include those described in
Risk Factors above, as well as the following:

 

	Competitive pressures among distributors of electronic
	components and computer products may increase significantly
	through industry consolidation, entry of new competitors or
	otherwise.

 

	General economic or business conditions, domestic and foreign,
	may be less favorable than expected, resulting in lower sales
	than expected.

 

	Costs or difficulties related to the integration into Avnet of
	newly-acquired businesses, and other businesses Avnet expects to
	acquire, may be greater than it expected.

 

	Avnet may lose customers or suppliers as a result of the merger
	and other recent acquisitions by Avnet.

 

	Legislative or regulatory changes may adversely affect the
	businesses in which Avnet and Kent are engaged.

 

	Adverse changes may occur in the securities markets.

 

	Changes in interest rates and currency fluctuations may reduce
	profit margins.

 

	Avnet or Kent may be adversely affected by the allocation of
	products by suppliers.

Because forward-looking statements are subject to risks and
uncertainties, actual results of Avnet or Kent may differ
materially from those expressed or implied by them. We caution
you not to place undue reliance on these statements, which speak
only as of the date of this proxy statement/ prospectus or the
date of any document incorporated by reference in this proxy
statement/ prospectus.

All future written and oral forward-looking statements
attributable to Kent and Avnet or any person acting on their
behalf are expressly qualified in their entirety by the
cautionary statements contained or referred to in this section.
Neither Kent nor Avnet undertakes any obligation to update
publicly or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a
result of new information, future events or otherwise.

THE KENT SPECIAL MEETING

Date, Time and Place

Kent is soliciting proxies on behalf of the board of directors
of Kent Electronics Corporation for use at the special meeting
of Kent shareholders scheduled to be held on
            ,
 2001 at 10:00 a.m., Houston time, at Chase Tower, 600
Travis Street, Suite 2500, Houston, Texas 77002. The sole
purpose of the meeting is to vote upon a proposal to approve and
adopt the merger agreement which is Appendix A to this
proxy statement/ prospectus.

The board of directors of Kent Electronics Corporation has
unanimously approved the merger agreement and recommends that
the Kent shareholders vote FOR approval and adoption of the
merger agreement.

Record Date; Vote Required

Record Date. 
The Kent board of directors has fixed the
close of business on
            ,
 2001, as the record date for the determination of shareholders
entitled to receive notice of and to vote at the Kent special
meeting. On the Kent record date, there were
               shares
 of Kent common stock issued and outstanding. You may vote at
the Kent special meeting only if you held Kent common stock of
record at the close of business on the Kent record date.

Quorum. 
The presence either in person or by properly
executed proxies of the holders of a majority of the shares of
Kent common stock outstanding on the record date will constitute
a quorum at the Kent special meeting.

Vote Required. 
Each outstanding share of Kent common
stock is entitled to one vote on each matter properly brought to
a vote of the Kent shareholders. The approval of the merger
agreement requires the affirmative vote of the holders of at
least two-thirds of the shares of Kent common stock outstanding
at the close of business on the record date. Therefore, a
failure to vote or a vote to abstain will have the same legal
effect as a vote against the merger agreement.

Brokers who hold shares of Kent common stock in
street name as nominees for customers who are the
beneficial owners of such shares will not have authority to vote
such shares on the merger proposal unless the brokers receive
specific voting instructions from such customers. Shares of Kent
common stock represented by proxies signed and returned by a
broker holding such shares in street name will be
counted for purposes of determining whether a quorum exists,
even if such shares are not voted. Votes which are not cast by
brokers because they received no instructions from one or more
of their customers are known as broker non-votes and
will have the same effect as a vote against the merger agreement.

Because approval of the merger agreement requires approval by
at least two-thirds of the votes represented by all outstanding
shares of Kent common stock, and because failures to vote and
broker non-votes will have the same effect as negative votes,
the Kent board of directors urges Kent shareholders to respond
to this proxy solicitation, whether by U.S. mail via the
enclosed, postage-paid envelope, or by instructions given to
your broker.

Directors and Officers Votes. 
As of the Kent
record date, directors and executive officers of Kent owned an
aggregate of 679,175 issued and outstanding shares of Kent
common stock over which they had or shared the power to vote,
representing in the aggregate approximately 2.4% of the votes
which may be cast at the Kent special meeting. All the directors
and executive officers of Kent have advised Kent that they
intend to vote all these shares for approval of the merger
agreement. In addition, an aggregate of five directors and
executive officers of Kent have granted to Avnet irrevocable
proxies to vote an aggregate of 592,250 shares, representing
approximately 2.1% of the votes which may be cast at the Kent
special meeting, for approval of the merger agreement. See
Other Agreements on page 67.

Voting and Revocation of Proxies

Record holders of Kent common stock may submit proxies by
completing and mailing the proxy card that accompanies this
proxy statement/ prospectus. Shares of Kent common stock
represented by a proxy properly signed and received by Kent at
or before the Kent special meeting will, unless subsequently
revoked, be voted in accordance with the holders
instructions.

To submit a written proxy by mail, a record holder of Kent
common stock should complete, sign, date and mail the proxy card
provided with this proxy statement/ prospectus in accordance
with the instructions set forth on the card. If a proxy card is
signed, dated and returned without indicating any voting
instructions, shares of Kent common stock represented by the
proxy will be voted FOR approval of the merger agreement.

A beneficial owner of Kent common stock whose shares are held of
record in street name by a broker, bank, custodian
or other nominee should follow the voting instructions received
from the nominee.

A record holder of Kent common stock may revoke his or her proxy
and change his or her vote at any time before the Kent special
meeting in any one of three ways:

 

	The shareholder may send a written notice that the shareholder
	is revoking the proxy to the Corporate Secretary of Kent at
	1111 Gillingham Lane, Sugar Land, Texas 77478, in time for
	it to be received before the meeting.

 

	The shareholder may complete and submit a new proxy card by
	mail. The latest dated proxy Kent actually receives by mail
	prior to the special meeting will be recorded and any earlier
	votes will be revoked.

 

	The shareholder may attend the special meeting and vote in
	person. However, simply attending the special meeting without
	voting will not revoke the shareholders proxy.

A Kent shareholder whose shares are held of record by a broker
or other nominee must follow the nominees instructions for
revocation.

Under Texas law, no business other than consideration of the
merger agreement may be acted upon at the Kent special meeting.
The persons appointed as proxies will have discretion to vote on
adjournment of the special meeting. The adjournment may be for
the purpose of soliciting additional proxies. However, shares
represented by proxies voting against approval of the merger
agreement will be voted against a proposal to adjourn the Kent
special meeting for the purpose of soliciting additional proxies.

Solicitation of Proxies

Kent will solicit proxies for the Kent special meeting primarily
by mail. However, if necessary to ensure satisfactory
representation at the special meeting, Kent may also solicit
proxies by telephone, telegraph, fax and personal interview by
employees of Kent, none of whom will receive special
compensation for such services. Also, Kent requests brokerage

THE AVNET SPECIAL MEETING

Date, Time and Place

Avnet is soliciting proxies on behalf of the board of directors
of Avnet, Inc. for use at the special meeting of Avnet
shareholders scheduled to be held on
            ,
 2001, at 10:00 a.m., local time, at
               .
 The purpose of the meeting is to consider and to vote upon a
proposal to approve the agreement and plan of merger which is
Appendix A to this proxy statement/ prospectus, and to
transact any other business that may properly come before the
meeting or any adjournments, postponements, continuations or
reschedulings of the meeting. Under New York law, only such
business may be transacted at the Avnet special meeting which is
related to the purpose set forth in the notice of meeting, that
is, approval of the merger agreement.

The board of directors of Avnet, Inc. has unanimously
approved the merger agreement and recommends that the Avnet
shareholders vote FOR approval of the merger agreement.

Record Date; Vote Required

Record Date. 
The Avnet board of directors has fixed the
close of business on
            ,
 2001, as the record date for the determination of shareholders
entitled to receive notice of and to vote at the Avnet special
meeting. You may vote at the Avnet special meeting only if you
held Avnet common stock of record at the close of business on
the Avnet record date.

As of the Avnet record date, there were
               shares
 of Avnet common stock issued and outstanding.

Quorum. 
The presence, in person or by proxy, of a
majority of the shares of common stock of Avnet entitled to vote
at the meeting will constitute a quorum for the transaction of
business.

Vote Required. 
Each share is entitled to one vote on each
matter properly submitted at the Avnet special meeting. Avnet
shareholder approval of the merger agreement is not required by
New York law. Under the rules of the New York Stock Exchange,
the affirmative vote of a majority of the total votes cast on
the merger proposal is required to approve the merger agreement,
so long as the total votes cast represent over 50% of the shares
of Avnet common stock outstanding on the Avnet record date.
Thus, shareholders who do not vote will not affect the outcome
of the vote so long as a quorum is present. A vote to abstain
will count as a negative vote cast.

Brokers who hold shares of Avnet common stock in
street name as nominees for customers who are the
beneficial owners of such shares will not have authority to vote
such shares on the merger proposal unless the

brokers receive specific voting instructions from such
customers. Shares of Avnet common stock represented by proxies
signed and returned by a broker holding such shares in nominee
or street name will be counted for purposes of
determining whether a quorum exists, even if such shares are not
voted. Votes which are not cast by brokers because they received
no instructions from one or more of their customers are known as
broker non-votes. Broker non-votes will not affect
the outcome of the vote.

Directors and Officers Votes. 
As of the Avnet
record date, directors and executive officers of Avnet owned an
aggregate of
               outstanding
 shares of Avnet common stock over which they had or shared the
power to vote, representing in the aggregate approximately
     % of the votes which may be cast
at the Avnet special meeting. The directors and executive
officers of Avnet have advised Avnet that they intend to vote
for approval of the merger agreement.

Voting and Revocation of Proxies

Record holders of Avnet common stock may submit proxies by
completing and mailing the proxy card that accompanies this
proxy statement/ prospectus or by submitting their voting
instructions by telephone or through the Internet. Shares of
Avnet common stock represented by a proxy properly signed and
received by Avnet at or before the Avnet special meeting will,
unless subsequently revoked, be voted in accordance with the
holders instructions.

To submit a written proxy by mail, a record holder of Avnet
common stock should complete, sign, date and mail the proxy card
provided with this proxy statement/ prospectus in accordance
with the instructions set forth on the card. If a proxy card is
signed and returned without indicating any voting instructions,
shares of Avnet common stock represented by the proxy will be
voted FOR approval of the merger agreement.

Instead of submitting a signed proxy card, record holders of
Avnet common stock may submit their voting instructions by
telephone or through the Internet. To submit voting instructions
via telephone or through the Internet, Avnet shareholders should
follow the instructions that accompany or are set forth on the
reverse side of their proxy card. Each Avnet shareholder of
record on the record date has been assigned a unique control
number, which has been printed on each holders proxy card.
Shareholders who submit proxies by telephone or through the
Internet will be required to provide their assigned control
number before their proxy will be accepted. In addition to the
instructions that appear on or accompany the proxy card,
step-by-step instructions will be provided by recorded telephone
message or at the designated website, and shareholders will
receive confirmation that their proxies have been successfully
submitted.

A beneficial owner of Avnet common stock whose shares are held
of record in street name by a broker, bank,
custodian or other nominee should follow the voting instructions
received from the nominee.

A record holder of Avnet common stock that signs and mails the
enclosed proxy may revoke it any time before it is voted by
giving written notice of revocation to Avnet, by delivering a
later dated proxy to Avnet before the Avnet special meeting or
by voting in person at the Avnet special meeting. However, your
proxy will not be revoked if you simply attend the Avnet special
meeting without voting. All written notices of revocation and
other communications with respect to revocation by Avnet
shareholders should be addressed to David R. Birk, Esq.,
Secretary, Avnet, Inc., 2211 South 47th Street, Phoenix,
Arizona 85034. To revoke a proxy previously submitted by
telephone or through the Internet, an Avnet shareholder of
record can simply vote again at a later date, using the same
procedures, in which case the later submitted vote will be
recorded and the earlier vote will thereby be revoked.

An Avnet shareholder whose shares are held of record by a broker
or other nominee must follow the nominees instructions for
revocation.

If an Avnet shareholder is a participant in Avnets
employee stock purchase plan, the Avnet proxy card will serve as
voting instructions with respect to the number of shares of
Avnet common stock held in the plan on behalf of the particular
shareholder. To ensure that all shares of Avnet common stock are
voted, the shareholder must sign and return every proxy card
received or provide his or her proxy with voting instructions by
telephone or through the Internet in the manner described in
each proxy card and using the assigned control number.

The Avnet board of directors is not currently aware of any
business to be acted upon at the special meeting other than as
described herein. If, however, other matters are properly
brought before the meeting, the persons appointed as proxies
will have discretion to vote or to act thereon according to
their best judgment, unless otherwise indicated on any
particular proxy. Under New York law, only such business may be
transacted at the Avnet special meeting which is related to the
purpose set forth in the attached notice of meeting 
that is, which is related to the proposal to approve the merger
agreement. The persons appointed as proxies will have discretion
to vote on adjournment of the Avnet special meeting. The
adjournment may be for the purpose of soliciting additional
proxies. However, shares represented by proxies voting against
approval of the merger agreement will be voted against a
proposal to adjourn the Avnet special meeting for the purpose of
soliciting additional proxies.

Solicitation of Proxies

Avnet will solicit proxies for the Avnet special meeting
primarily by mail. However, if necessary to ensure satisfactory
representation at the Avnet special meeting, Avnet may also
solicit proxies by telephone, telegraph, fax and personal
interview by employees of Avnet, none of whom will receive
special compensation for such services. Also, Avnet requests
brokerage houses, nominees, fiduciaries and other custodians
holding Avnet common stock to forward soliciting materials to
beneficial owners and will reimburse them for their reasonable
expenses incurred in sending materials to beneficial owners.

In addition, Avnet has retained Georgeson Shareholder
Communications Inc. to assist in the solicitation of proxies
from its shareholders. Avnet will pay Georgeson Shareholder
Communications Inc. approximately $8,000 for its services plus
its reasonable out-of-pocket costs and expenses.

Avnet shareholders should not send Avnet common stock
certificates with their proxy cards. If the merger is completed,
Avnet shareholders will not need to exchange their stock
certificates.

of the agreement, Avnet acquired (a) the Munich,
Germany-headquartered EBV Group, consisting of EBV Elektronik
and WBC, both pan-European semiconductor distributors, and Atlas
Services Europe, logistics provider for the EBV Group; and
(b) the Nettetal, Germany-based RKE Systems, a computer
products and services distributor. The combined companies being
acquired from E.On AG reported calendar 1999 sales of
approximately $1.8 billion (using average exchange rates for
calendar 1999).

Also during Avnets fiscal year 2001, on July 3, 2001,
Avnet acquired the Savoir Technology Group, Inc., a leading
distributor of IBM mid-range server products in the Americas.
The total cost of the acquisition of

Savoir including estimated expenses was approximately $144.6
million, consisting of the cost for the Savoir shares of $110.8
million in Avnet stock and $0.8 million in Avnet stock options
(net of related tax benefits of $0.5 million) as well as $0.8
million for direct transaction expenses and $32.2 million for
the refinancing of Savoir net debt.

Currently, Avnet has approximately 13,800 employees globally and
maintains locations throughout the United States, Canada,
Mexico, Europe, Asia, Australia, New Zealand, South Africa and
Brazil. In fiscal 2000, Avnet derived approximately 27% of its
sales from operations outside of North America as compared with
23% in fiscal 1999. At the same time, Avnet disposed of those
operations which it concluded were outside of Avnets core
business, including the disposition in July 1999 of Allied
Electronics, a distributor by way of a printed catalog of active
and passive electronic components, test equipment and electronic
equipment, and the disposition in 1998 of Avnets Channel
Master business, the sole remaining operation in Avnets
former Video Communications Group.

Organizational Structure

Avnet currently consists of three major operating groups:
Electronics Marketing (EM), Computer Marketing
(CM) and Avnet Applied Computing (AAC).

Electronics Marketing (EM)

Electronics Marketing is Avnets largest operating group,
with fiscal 2000 sales of $6.64 billion, representing
approximately 72.4% of Avnets consolidated sales. EM is
comprised of three regional operations: EM Americas, which
had sales of $4.69 billion in fiscal 2000, or approximately
51.1% of Avnets consolidated sales; EM EMEA (Europe,
Middle East and Africa), which had sales of $1.55 billion in
fiscal 2000, or approximately 16.9% of Avnets consolidated
sales; and EM Asia, which had sales of $0.40 billion in
fiscal 2000, or approximately 4.4% of Avnets consolidated
sales.

Through EM Americas customers have complete access to the
products and services of Avnets core distribution
business, as well as complete access to the following global
brands (services):

 

Core Value Services
  Focuses on the
	transactional needs of the traditional electronic components
	distribution market, offering one of the industrys
	broadest line cards and convenient one-stop shopping with an
	emphasis on on-time delivery, responsiveness and quality.

 

Avnet Design Services
  Provides an array of
	engineering and technical services for customers, including
	turnkey logic designs, reference designs and product designs,
	and demand creation services for suppliers.

 

Avnet Integrated Material Services
  Provides
	customer-specific materials management, including leading-edge,
	information technology-based services, and pin-point logistics.
	Integrated Material Services develops and implements innovative
	materials management solutions for EMs major customers and
	their contract manufacturers

These Avnet global brands offer focused services and unique
financial models in the other two EM geographic regions
(EM EMEA and EM Asia) as well as in EM Americas.

In addition, EM Americas product business groups
specialize in the various product categories that Avnet sells.
There are currently three product business groups that are
responsible for purchasing, inventory management, supplier
relationships and product marketing: (1) Semiconductor;
(2) Interconnect, Passive and Electromechanical; and
(3) Radio Frequency and Microwave. EM EMEA and
EM Asia/ Pacific operate along similar lines to more
effectively position Avnet as a true global distributor.

EM EMEA, one of the largest distributors of electronic
components in Europe as measured by sales, distributes
semiconductors, interconnect, passive and electromechanical
devices, and technical communication products in 40 western
and eastern European countries, South Africa and Israel. It also
provides the full range of value-added services associated with
the products it sells through Avnet Integrated Material Services
and Avnet Design Services.

EM EMEA is forming five separate and highly focused, specialized
electronic components distribution organizations, served by a
common integrated panEuropean logistical backbone and
industry leading supply-chain services. EBV Electronik and WBC,
formerly part of the VEBA Electronics Distribution Group, will
continue to manage their businesses under their own well-known
and respected branch names, as will BFI Optilas, an Avnet
company since 1995. Two new organizations, Avnet Semi and
Avnet IP&E (which will both be re-branded shortly),
will be the result of dividing the pre-existing EM EMEA
organization into two operations, one focused on semiconductor
products, the other on interconnect, passive and
electromechanical products. Logistics and supply-chain services
will be provided to the five operations by Avnet Logistics,
consisting of the former Avnet warehouse operations and
programming centers plus Avnet Logistics, the former logistical
backbone of EBV Elektronik and WBC.

EM Asia is a value-added distributor of electronic components
and services in 10 Asian countries and Australia and New
Zealand. All the EM Asia operations have complete access to
the products and services provided by the Avnet global brands.
In July 1999, following the successful implementation of
their SAP computer system, the companies comprising
EM Asia began operating as an integrated business unit
headed by Avnet Asia Pte Ltd., with its regional
headquarters and centralized warehouse in Singapore. In
December 1999, Avnet acquired the business of Korea-based
Cosco Electronics/ Jung Kwang, electronic components
distribution companies.

Computer Marketing (CM)

Computer Marketing is an international distributor of computer
products to value-added resellers and end users focusing
primarily on middle- to high-end, value-added computer products
and services. CMs fiscal 2000 sales were $1.86 billion,
representing approximately 20.3% of Avnets consolidated
sales. CM consists of three major business units 
Avnet Hall-Mark, Avnet Enterprise Solutions and Avnet Convergent
Technologies.

Avnet Hall-Mark concentrates on sales of computer systems,
peripherals and components to the reseller channel. Avnet
Hall-Mark is one of the industrys leading technical
distributors of open systems that support a limited line card of
the foremost computer and peripherals manufacturers, which
include Compaq, Hewlett-Packard, IBM, Intel and Oracle. Avnet
Hall-Mark provides those manufacturers products to
value-added resellers, along with complementary value-added
solutions and in-house engineering support, complex systems
integration and configuration services.

Avnet Enterprise Solutions sells industry leading high-end
systems, mid-range servers, workstations, PCs, software,
storage, networking, peripherals and services to end-user
customers. Avnet Enterprise Solutions is a technology solutions
integrator, providing hardware, software and services for
corporate-wide infrastructure needs. Avnet Enterprise Solutions
leverages its array of acquisition and technical services to
bring value to businesses intent on managing their total cost of
technology infrastructure  from the data center,
through the network, to the desktop.

Avnet Convergent Technologies is a value-added distributor of
networking, wireless, data collection, point of sale peripherals
and Auto ID equipment. Avnet Convergent Technologies provides a

integration, lead generation and custom financing. Avnet
Convergent Technologies delivers fully integrated solutions from
leading manufacturers such as Compaq, Hewlett-Packard, IBM,
Intel, Enterasys and Symbol Technologies. It markets its
products and services to North American value added resellers.

During 1998, CM expanded its operations into Europe by starting
an operation in Germany and then expanding its European
operations into Austria, Switzerland, Poland, The Czech
Republic, Belgium and Hungary. It further expanded its
international operations by completing a number of
acquisitions  Bytech Systems Ltd. in the United
Kingdom in May 1998, Integrand Solutions in Australia in
July 1999, and PCD Italia S.r.1. and
Matica S.p.A. in Italy in November 1999. CM
strengthened its focus on the IBM product line with the
January 1999 acquisition of the Computer Solutions Division
of JBA International and the July 2000 acquisition of
Savoir Technology Group, Inc. Savoir was one of the leading
distributors of IBM mid-range server products in the Americas
with calendar 1999 sales of $767 million.

Avnet Applied Computing
(AAC)

In October 1999, Avnet Applied Computing began operations
in the Americas as a separate group. AAC was created from
portions of Electronics Marketing (OEM Systems Product Business
Group and Personal Computer Components) and Computer Marketing
(Hall-Mark Computer Components). AAC focuses on the unique
requirements of the OEM market for computing technology.
AACs fiscal 2000 sales were $670.5 million, representing
7.3% of Avnets consolidated sales.

AAC consists of three major business units focusing on key
market segments. The first unit is Applied Computing Components,
which serves the needs of manufacturers of general-purpose
computers by providing them leading-edge technologies such as
microprocessors, DRAM modules and motherboards. The second
business unit is Applied Computing Solutions, which provides
technical design, integration, marketing and financial services
to developers of application specific computer solutions in the
non-PC market place. Examples of these types of customers are
OEMs in the medical, telecommunications, industrial control and
digital creation market segments. The third business unit is
Applied Computer Enabling Technologies, which serve systems
integrators focusing on the mass storage market place that
produce applications such as NAS, SAN and Fiber storage products.

During Avnets 2001 fiscal year, AAC expanded its
operations in Europe with the addition of RKE Systems and the
EBV Microsystems group. These groups have been integrated into
AAC and now the operating group has all three business units
represented in Europe. AACs coverage of Europe includes:
the United Kingdom, Germany, Spain, Italy, Austria (services
eastern Europe also), the Nordic region, the Benelux region,
France and Switzerland. AACs European operations account
for approximately half of the operating groups revenue.

THE MERGER

This discussion of the merger and the principal terms of the
merger agreement is subject to, and qualified in its entirety by
reference to, the Agreement and Plan of Merger dated as of
March 21, 2001, by and among Avnet, Alpha Acquisition Corp.
and Kent, which is attached to this proxy statement/ prospectus
as Appendix A and incorporated herein by reference.

General

We are furnishing this proxy statement/prospectus to holders of
Kent common stock and Avnet common stock in connection with the
solicitation of proxies by the boards of directors of Kent and
Avnet for use at their special meetings of shareholders, and at
any adjournments, postponements, continuations or reschedulings
of these meetings. At the special meetings, the Kent
shareholders and Avnet shareholders will be asked to consider
and to vote upon proposals to approve the merger agreement.

The merger agreement provides for the merger of Alpha
Acquisition Corp., a wholly-owned subsidiary of Avnet, into
Kent. At the effective time of the merger, the separate
corporate existence of Alpha will cease and Kent will remain as
the surviving corporation in the merger and a wholly-owned
subsidiary of Avnet. Each share of Avnet common stock issued and
outstanding before the merger will remain an issued and
outstanding share of Avnet common stock after the merger. Kent
common stock outstanding at the effective time of the merger
will be converted by the merger into Avnet common stock as
described under The Merger Agreement  Terms of
the Merger on page 57. The merger will become
effective when the Secretary of State of Texas issues a
certificate of merger, or at a subsequent date or time that Kent
and Avnet agree on and specify in the articles of merger which
Kent and Alpha deliver to the Texas Secretary of State. The
merger is intended to qualify as a tax-free
reorganization within the meaning of
Section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as
amended, for federal income tax purposes.

In the merger, each share of Kent common stock will be converted
into a right to receive 0.87 of a share of common stock of
Avnet. As of March 21, 2001, the date on which the merger
agreement was executed and delivered, the implied value of a
share of Kent common stock was $20.49 based on the exchange
ratio in the merger agreement. The closing price per share of
Avnet common stock for New York Stock Exchange composite
transactions on [record date] was
$          ,
and the implied value of a share of Kent common stock on the
record date was $       ,
based on the exchange ratio in the merger agreement.

After the merger, persons who were Avnet shareholders before the
merger will own approximately 78.8% of the outstanding shares of
Avnet common stock, and Kent shareholders will own approximately
21.2% of the outstanding shares of Avnet common stock, based on
the numbers of shares outstanding as of [record date] and on the
merger exchange ratio.

Background to the Merger

Over the last several years, there have been occasional brief
exploratory discussions between various members of the senior
management of Avnet and Kent to determine whether they should
consider a business combination. None of these discussions
progressed beyond the informal stage.

During early January 2001, Avnets Chairman of the
Board and Chief Executive Officer, Roy Vallee, spoke to Larry
Olson, President and Chief Executive Officer of Kent.
Mr. Olson told Mr. Vallee that Kent was evaluating its
strategic business plan and that in connection with this review,
Kent was willing to engage in preliminary discussions with Avnet
about the possibility of a business combination. Mr. Vallee
and Mr. Olson agreed to meet on January 19, 2001.

On January 18, 2001, the Kent board of directors held a
regularly-scheduled meeting. Stephen J. Chapko, an
Executive Vice President and the Chief Financial Officer of
Kent, and Kents legal counsel also attended the meeting at
the boards invitation. At this meeting, Mr. Olson
advised the board that he and Morrie Abramson, Kents
Chairman of the Board, would be meeting with Mr. Vallee on
January 19, 2001 to discuss the possibility of a business
combination with Avnet.

Thereafter, Mr. Olson and Mr. Abramson periodically
advised members of Kents board of the progress of their
discussions with Avnet until the merger agreement was signed. In
addition, thereafter from time-to-time board members conferred
with Kents legal counsel regarding the proposed merger.

On January 19, 2001, Mr. Vallee and Raymond Sadowski,
Avnets Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer,
met with Mr. Olson and Mr. Abramson in Houston, Texas.
Mr. Olson and Mr. Abramson reviewed the Kent business,
especially the Kent Datacomm division. At the end of the
meeting, Mr. Abramson gave an indication as to a per share
price at which he believed Avnet would be able to acquire Kent.
He further stated that Kent would be open to discuss a potential
transaction involving cash, stock or a combination of both, but
acknowledged that given Avnets recent acquisitions, he
understood Avnet might prefer to issue its stock.
Messrs. Vallee and Sadowski did not respond at that time
but committed to get back to Mr. Olson with any interest in
further discussions.

In conjunction with the initial discussions, the companies began
consulting with their legal advisors about issues raised in the
discussions among their executives. These consultations
continued between Avnets management and its counsel,
Carter, Ledyard & Milburn, and Kents management and
its counsel, Locke Liddell & Sapp LLP, throughout the
remaining merger discussions.

On January 25, 2001, the day before a regularly scheduled
meeting of Avnets board of directors, Mr. Vallee and
Mr. Sadowski notified members of Avnets board that
senior management was engaged in preliminary discussions about a
possible acquisition of Kent.

After Avnet senior management performed preliminary analysis of
the share price indicated by Mr. Abramson, Mr. Vallee
called Mr. Olson on January 26, 2001, and indicated
that Avnet was interested in continuing discussions with Kent
about a possible acquisition, but not at the price range
suggested by Mr. Abramson at the initial meeting.
Mr. Vallee indicated that Avnet would consider a potential
transaction at a fixed ratio of exchange whereby Kent
shareholders would receive a portion of an Avnet share for each
share of common stock of Kent and they discussed the range at
which Avnet would consider moving forward. Mr. Vallee and
Mr. Olson also discussed the economic impact on Avnet of
combining the two companies.

On January 29, 2001, Mr. Sadowski and Mr. Olson
continued discussions relating to an appropriate exchange ratio
for the proposed merger.

On February 6, 2001, Mr. Vallee, Mr. Sadowski and
Mr. Olson continued discussions relating to an appropriate
exchange ratio for the proposed merger.

On February 8, 2001 Mr. Olson and Mr. Sadowski
engaged in further discussions regarding an appropriate exchange
ratio and the economic impact of an acquisition on Avnets
earnings. Mr. Sadowski indicated that Avnet was prepared to
continue exploring a transaction at the exchange ratio
discussed. Later that day, Mr. Sadowski discussed the
possible merger of Avnet and Kent with representatives of
Avnets financial advisor, Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner
& Smith Incorporated.

On February 8, 2001, Mr. Olson updated the Kent board
of directors on Avnets interest in acquiring Kent and
informed the Kent board of certain key strategic benefits to the
proposed merger that he believed warranted further discussions
with Avnet. Mr. Olson also alerted the Kent board to
certain risks and uncertainties relating to the proposed merger.

On February 9, 2001, the Kent board held a special meeting
to discuss further Avnets proposal to acquire Kent. At the
request of the board, Mr. Chapko and Kents legal
counsel attended this meeting. At the meeting, Mr. Olson
and Mr. Abramson briefed the board on their discussions
with Avnets management in greater detail, including
additional information relating to discussions about the
consideration that Kents shareholders would receive in the
proposed merger, as well as a review of the strategic benefits
that Mr. Olson and Mr. Abramson believed would result
from the merger in light of current industry conditions and
trends. Based on these discussions, the Kent board authorized
management to continue discussions with Avnet regarding the
proposed merger and authorized Kent to engage a financial
advisor for the proposed transaction. In addition, the Kent
board discussed the fact that Mr. Abramson, Mr. Olson
and other members of management would have potential conflicts
of interest in connection with the proposed merger. On the advice

of legal counsel, the Kent board took under advisement the
potential benefits of creating a special committee of the board
to consider the proposed merger for purposes of making a
recommendation to the full board as to whether or not Kent
should enter into the merger agreement.

On February 9, 2001, Mr. Vallee, Mr. Sadowski and
David Birk, Avnets Senior Vice President and General
Counsel, met with representatives of Merrill Lynch and
Avnets counsel, Carter, Ledyard & Milburn, and
discussed the possible merger of the two companies and due
diligence necessary to undertake.

On February 9, 2001, Kent engaged Credit Suisse First
Boston as its financial advisor for the proposed merger.

On February 11, 2001, Mr. Sadowski and Mr. Olson
discussed various issues regarding a merger, including change of
control agreements between Kent and several of its executive
officers and convertible debentures and warrants that had been
issued by Kent. Mr. Olson advised that Credit Suisse First
Boston Corporation would act as financial advisor to Kent
regarding the possible transaction.

On February 13, 2001, Mr. Sadowski and Mr. Olson
discussed the change of control agreements between Kent and
several of its executive officers. See The
Merger  Interests of Certain Persons in the Merger
and Possible Conflicts of Interest on page 49.

Avnet held a special meeting of its board of directors on
February 13, 2001, by telephone. Mr. Sadowski,
Mr. Birk and representatives of Merrill Lynch also attended
the meeting. Avnets board discussed the terms of the
potential transaction and the possible effects of a transaction
on Avnet and Avnets earnings and authorized management to
continue to explore the possibility of a merger between the two
companies.

On February 18, 2001, Mr. Sadowski called
Mr. Olson regarding a possible adjustment, based upon
Avnets further analysis, to the exchange ratio for the
acquisition of Kent. Later that day, Mr. Olson and
Mr. Sadowski again discussed the fixed ratio of exchange
after Mr. Olson had briefed Mr. Abramson concerning
the earlier discussion between Mr. Sadowski and
Mr. Olson.

On February 19, 2001, Mr. Olson and Mr. Vallee
discussed a proposed adjustment to the fixed ratio of exchange.

On February 20, 2001, Mr. Sadowski and Mr. Chapko
discussed due diligence concerning the potential transaction.
Later that day, Mr. Sadowski delivered a due diligence list
to Kent and Credit Suisse First Boston and scheduled meetings to
obtain requested information. In addition, later that day,
Credit Suisse First Boston, acting on behalf of Kent, delivered
a due diligence list to Avnet.

On February 22, 2001, Mr. Sadowski, Mr. Olson and
Mr. Chapko discussed the status of due diligence concerning
the potential transaction.

On February 23, 2001, Avnets counsel sent a draft of
a proposed merger agreement to Kents counsel.

Between February 26, 2001 and March 2, 2001,
Mr. Sadowski or Mr. Vallee contacted each Avnet
director individually to report on the status of the potential
transaction.

In light of the potential conflicts of interest of
Mr. Abramson and Mr. Olson and other members of
management, the Kent board established, by unanimous written
consent dated February 26, 2001, a special committee
consisting of three independent and disinterested directors for
the purpose of evaluating whether or not it would be in the best
interests of Kent and its shareholders for Kent to enter into
the merger agreement with Avnet. Leroy Morgan, David Siegel and
Alvin L. Zimmerman were appointed to serve on the special
committee.

On March 2, 2001, Kents counsel sent initial comments
on the draft merger agreement to Avnets counsel.

On March 4, 2001, Mr. Vallee, Mr. Sadowski,
Andrew Bryant, President of Avnets Computer Marketing
group, Steven Church, Co-President of Avnets Electronics
Marketing group, Patrick Jewett, Avnet Senior Vice President,
Mr. Olson, Mr. Chapko, and Mark Zerbe, President of
Kents Datacomm division, met informally over dinner and
discussed the Kent business. Those participants met again on
March 5, 2001 for

high level discussions of the possible business combination,
including potential synergies between the businesses.

From March 5, 2001 through March 14, 2001
representatives of Avnet and Arthur Andersen, Avnets
independent auditors, met with or spoke to representatives of
Kent in Houston for due diligence review and discussions, and
Avnets counsel met with Kents counsel and conducted
due diligence of certain of Kents contracts and
agreements. Concurrent with Avnets due diligence of Kent,
Kents legal counsel conducted due diligence on Avnet by
reviewing certain publicly available materials, and Kents
management reviewed certain business and operational issues
related to Avnet with representatives of Avnet.

On March 12, 2001, Avnets counsel sent a revised
draft of a proposed merger agreement to Kents counsel, and
Messrs. Vallee, Sadowski and Olson discussed the effect of
each companys projected earnings in the current quarter on
the potential transaction.

On March 13, 2001, Messrs. Vallee, Sadowski, Birk,
Abramson and Olson and Lynn Morgen, Kents public relations
consultant, discussed issues relating to the public announcement
of a merger if the transaction was completed.

On March 14, 2001, Messrs. Vallee, Sadowski and Birk,
representatives of Merrill Lynch, Mr. Olson,
Mr. Chapko, representatives of Credit Suisse First Boston
and Kents counsel met to respond to due diligence
questions of the financial advisors and legal counsel in
connection with the proposed transaction.

On March 16, 2001 Mr. Sadowski and Mr. Olson
discussed the exchange ratio for the acquisition.
Mr. Sadowski noted that Avnet, after review of due
diligence and other financial information, was concerned about
the impact of the acquisition on Avnets earnings.

Later that day, Mr. Olson and Mr. Vallee discussed the
economics of the proposed acquisition. Mr. Sadowski and
Mr. Olson had two additional conversations regarding the
fixed exchange ratio at which Avnet was willing to proceed later
that day and into the evening.

On March 17, 2001, Mr. Sadowski and Mr. Olson had
further discussions and reached a preliminary understanding
regarding the exchange ratio, subject to negotiation of all
other terms and conditions of the acquisition, final review of
the acquisition by their respective financial advisers and legal
counsel and approval of each Board of Directors.

Over the next several days, representatives of Avnet and Kent
and their respective counsel continued to negotiate the terms of
the proposed merger agreement and related agreements. See
Other Agreements on page 67.

On March 20, 2001, the special committee of Kents
board of directors held a meeting to consider the proposed
transaction. At this meeting, the Kent special committee first
met with Kents legal counsel without anyone else being
present, including any other director or member of Kents
management. At the beginning of the meeting, the special
committee was advised of its fiduciary duties relating to the
transaction. In addition, the special committee was advised by
counsel of the principal terms of the proposed merger and the
results of the due diligence review of Avnet, and Kents
counsel described the terms of the proposed merger agreement and
stock option agreement (current drafts and executive summaries
of which were provided to the special committee in advance of
the meeting) and responded to questions from the special
committee. After completing its meeting with legal counsel, the
special committee considered the strategic reasons for the
proposed merger through presentations by, and discussions with,
Mr. Olson and Mr. Abramson. Thereafter, the special
committee reviewed the financial terms of the proposed merger
with Credit Suisse First Boston. After excusing Kents
management and the representatives of Credit Suisse First Boston
from the meeting, and after due deliberation, the special
committee unanimously approved the merger agreement and the
related agreements and the transactions contemplated by those
agreements and determined to recommend that the full board of
directors of Kent vote to approve and adopt the merger agreement
and stock option agreement and recommend that the shareholders
of Kent approve and adopt the merger agreement.

On March 21, 2001, the board of directors of Kent met to
consider the proposed transaction. Mr. Chapko also attended
this meeting. After being advised by legal counsel of its
fiduciary duties relating to the transaction, the Kent board
considered the strategic reasons for the proposed merger, the
principal terms of the proposed merger, the recommendation of
the special committee and the results of the due diligence
review of Avnet. In addition, Kents counsel described to
the board the terms of the proposed merger agreement and certain
related agreements (current drafts and executive summaries of
which were provided to the board in advance of the meeting) and
responded to questions from directors. Thereafter,
representatives of Credit Suisse First Boston joined the meeting
to make a presentation to the board of directors of Kent
regarding the financial terms of the proposed merger. After this
presentation, Credit Suisse First Boston delivered its oral
opinion, which opinion was confirmed by delivery of a written
opinion dated March 21, 2001, to the effect that, as of
that date and based on and subject to the procedures followed,
assumptions made, matters considered and limitations on review
described in its opinion, the exchange ratio in the merger was
fair to the holders of Kent common stock from a financial point
of view. After excusing the representatives of Credit Suisse
First Boston from the meeting, and after due deliberation, the
Kent board of directors unanimously approved the merger
agreement and the related agreements and the transactions
contemplated by those agreements and resolved to recommend that
Kents shareholders vote to approve and adopt the merger
agreement.

On March 21, 2001, the board of directors of Avnet met to
consider the proposed transaction. Mr. Vallee discussed the
strategic reasons for the acquisition with the board.
Representatives of Merrill Lynch reviewed for the Avnet board of
directors its financial analysis of the proposed exchange ratio
and delivered to the Avnet board of directors an oral opinion,
which opinion was confirmed by delivery of a written opinion
dated March 21, 2001, to the effect that, as of that date
and based on and subject to the matters described in its
opinion, the exchange ratio provided for in the merger was fair,
from a financial point of view, to Avnet. The board of directors
of Avnet then considered and approved the principal terms of the
acquisition and authorized Avnet management to finalize the
appropriate documents and execute definitive agreements.

Final negotiations continued through the evening of
March 21, 2001, and the merger agreement and related
agreements were executed late that evening. A press release
announcing the merger transaction was issued at approximately
2:00 a.m. on March 22, 2001.

Kents Reasons for the Merger

In reaching the decision to approve the merger, the Kent special
committee and full board considered, among other factors,
various strategic benefits expected to be derived from the
merger. Kent has summarized below the key strategic benefits
identified by the Kent special committee and full board during
their evaluation of the proposed merger. References below to the
views and beliefs of the Kent board also reflect the views and
beliefs of the special committee of the Kent board.

Enhanced Shareholder Value. 
The overriding reason for the
merger is that the Kent board believes the proposed combination
of Kent and Avnet should generate substantially more value for
shareholders than Kent could generate on its own or in
connection with any other reasonably possible transaction. The
combined company would be better-positioned to meet the
challenges posed by ongoing consolidation and change in the
electronics component distribution industry.

Business Strategy and Industry Trends. 
The electronics
component distribution industry is undergoing significant change
that is resulting in increased competition and narrowing
margins. In addition, customers are becoming more sophisticated,
are demanding more services, capabilities and products, and are
reducing their number of suppliers. Moreover, during the past
several years the electronics distribution industry has
undergone significant consolidation. One of the results of this
consolidation has been that certain competitors of Kent have
become global in size and have an expanded range of product
offerings. At the same time, many of Kents customers and
prospective customers have also consolidated and grown
substantially larger and frequently prefer to deal with
companies that can provide a full range of products on a global
basis. Kents suppliers are also reducing their number of
distributors, favoring those that can provide a full line of
products and that have global reach. Based on the foregoing
factors, the Kent board believes that the most successful
companies in this industry in the future will have significantly
greater resources than Kent currently has.

Although the Kent board believes that Kent could over time meet
these challenges if it remained independent, the Kent board also
believes that the combined company would immediately have the
requisite scale to provide the resources necessary for the
combined company to capitalize on opportunities as they emerge,
to respond effectively to rapid change in the electronics
distribution industry and to meet the needsof customers by
offering a much broader range of products to Kents
customers than Kent currently can on its own.

Enhanced Employee Opportunities. 
While recognizing that a
number of jobs will be eliminated (especially at Kents
headquarters in Houston), the Kent board believes that the
merger would create greater career opportunities for a majority
of Kents employees, given the leadership position that the
combined company would enjoy in several key product areas.

Synergies and Cost Savings. 
While potential cost savings
are not the principal reason for the merger, the transaction
would nevertheless be expected to produce significant cost
savings and incremental net revenue from combining the two
companies.

Recommendation of, and Factors Considered by, Kents
Board of Directors

At a meeting of the special committee of Kents board of
directors held on March 20, 2001, after due consideration
of the factors described below, the special committee
unanimously:

 

	determined that the merger agreement, the stock option agreement
	and the merger are fair to, and in the best interests of, Kent
	and its shareholders;

 

	approved the merger agreement and the stock option agreement; and

 

	determined to recommend that the Kent board approve the merger
	agreement and stock option agreement and recommend that the
	shareholders of Kent approve the merger agreement.

Thereafter, at a meeting of Kents board of directors held
on March 21, 2001, after due consideration of the special
committees recommendations and the factors described
below, the Kent board unanimously:

 

	determined that the merger agreement, the stock option agreement
	and the merger are fair to, and in the best interests of, Kent
	and its shareholders;

 

	approved the merger agreement and the stock option agreement; and

 

	determined to recommend that the shareholders of Kent approve
	the merger agreement.

Accordingly, the Kent board of directors unanimously
recommends that the Kent shareholders vote FOR approval and
adoption of the merger agreement.

Kents board made its determination after careful
consideration of, and based on, a number of factors, including
those described below, which are the material factors that the
board considered:

 

	all the reasons described above under Kents Reasons
	for the Merger;

 

	the possibility, as alternatives to the merger, of not pursuing
	any transaction or of pursuing an acquisition of, or a business
	combination or joint venture with, an entity other than Avnet,
	and the Kent boards conclusion that a transaction with
	Avnet is more feasible, and is expected to yield greater
	benefits, than the likely alternatives;

 

	the value of the exchange ratio provided for in the merger
	agreement relative to the current market prices and historical
	trading prices of Kent and Avnet;

 

	that as more fully described below under
	 Rationale for Fixed Exchange Ratio, it
	was more advantageous for Kents shareholders for the
	exchange ratio to be fixed rather than being subject to
	adjustment;

 

	current industry, economic and market conditions, developments
	and trends and the boards analysis of their potential
	impacts on Kent, Avnet and the combined company;

 

	the ability to complete the merger as a tax-free reorganization
	for U.S. federal income tax purposes, and the boards
	conclusion that this treatment would be beneficial to a large
	number of Kents shareholders;

 

	the terms and conditions of the merger agreement, including the
	conditions to closing and the fact that the merger agreement is
	not subject to termination in the event of any change in the
	trading prices of either companys stock between signing of
	the merger agreement and closing and the boards ultimate
	determination that these terms and conditions were appropriate
	given the nature of the transaction;

 

	the restrictions under the merger agreement on Kents
	ability to entertain third party acquisition proposals and the
	payment of termination fees in specified circumstances and the
	boards determination of the appropriateness of these
	provisions, including with respect to their impact on the
	likelihood that the transaction would ultimately be consummated;

 

	the grant by Kent to Avnet of an option to acquire stock
	exercisable under specified circumstances pursuant to the stock
	option agreement, as discussed under Other
	Agreements  Kent Option below, and the
	boards determination of the appropriateness of the terms
	of the stock option agreement, including with respect to their
	impact on the likelihood that the transaction would ultimately
	be consummated;

 

	the terms and conditions of the inducement agreements entered
	into by certain directors and officers of Kent which require
	such persons to vote in favor of the merger as discussed under
	Other Agreements  Inducement Agreements
	below, including with respect to their impact on the likelihood
	that the transaction would ultimately be consummated;

 

	the presentation made by Credit Suisse First Boston at the
	meeting of the Kent board of directors on March 21, 2001,
	and Credit Suisse First Bostons opinion to the effect
	that, as of March 21, 2001, and based upon and subject to
	the procedures followed, assumptions made, matters considered
	and limitations on review described in its opinion, the exchange
	ratio in the merger was fair to the holders of Kent common stock
	from a financial point of view;

 

	the role that certain members of Kents current management
	would play in the management of the combined company, and the
	boards belief that this role would lead to increased
	shareholder value over the long-term; and

 

	the potential adverse consequences of the merger, including the
	challenges of combining Kent and Avnet and the related risk of
	not achieving the expected synergies and other benefits and of
	diverting management focus and resources from other strategic
	opportunities and operational matters for an extended period of
	time.

In view of the number and wide variety of factors considered in
connection with its evaluation of the merger, and the complexity
of these matters, Kents board did not find it useful to,
nor did it attempt to, quantify, rank or otherwise assign
relative weights to the specific factors it considered. In
addition, the Kent board did not undertake to make any specific
determination as to whether any particular factor was favorable
or unfavorable to the board of directors ultimate
determination or assign any particular weight to any factor, but
rather conducted an overall analysis of the factors described
above, including through discussions with and questioning of
Kents management and reviewing information received from,
and engaging in discussions with and questioning, Kents
legal and financial advisors. In considering the factors
described above, individual members of the board of directors
may have given different weight to different factors.
Kents board of directors considered all these factors as a
whole, and overall considered the factors to be favorable to,
and to support, its determination.

In considering the recommendation of the Kent board,
shareholders should be aware that certain officers and directors
of Kent have interests in the proposed merger that are different
from and in addition to the interests of Kent shareholders
generally. The Kent board and special committee were aware of
these potential conflicts of interests and considered them in
approving the merger and merger agreement. See Interests
of Certain Persons in the Merger and Possible Conflicts of
Interests that begins on page 49 of this document.

Rationale for Fixed Exchange Ratio

In agreeing to a fixed exchange ratio for the merger, the Kent
board considered the merits of a collar or other adjustable
exchange ratio. The board concluded, however, that a fixed
exchange ratio was preferable under all the circumstances,
despite the fact that the price of Avnets common stock
could decrease after announcement of the transaction. The
material reasons for this decision are described below.

Given its view of the combined companys prospects, the
Kent board concluded that the benefits to Kents
shareholders of owning a significant percentage of the combined
company was more important than securing protection against
near-term price movements in Avnets common stock through a
collar or other adjustable exchange ratio. While a fixed
exchange ratio exposes Kents shareholders to a decline in
nominal value if the price of Avnets stock falls in the
period between announcement and closing, it also allows
Kents shareholders to benefit from the potential strength
of the combination over time. The ultimate value of the combined
company will be determined not by movements in Avnets
stock price between announcement and closing, but by the
performance of the combined company over time. The Kent board
concluded that concerns about near-term market fluctuations
generally should not outweigh judgments about longer-term value.

Finally, the Kent board was interested in insulating the
transaction, to the extent practical, from any uncertainty that
might be generated by near-term market developments. In the
boards judgment, near-term movements in market prices, or
in the price of Avnets common stock, are often unrelated
to the fundamental financial and strategic factors supporting
the transaction or to the longer-term value of the combination.
Yet such movements in the context of a collar or other
adjustable exchange ratio can create uncertainty with respect to
the consummation of a transaction if the issuer is forced to
issue more shares to compensate for near-term changes in nominal
value. In fact, the existence of a collar or adjustable exchange
ratio can aggravate an initial decline in an issuers stock
price because it could require the issuer to issue additional
shares to the recipient shareholders. The avoidance of the
uncertainty that can be created by a collar or adjustable
exchange ratio was another important factor in the Kent
boards decision to agree to a fixed exchange ratio.

Avnets Reasons for the Merger; Recommendation of the
Avnet Board of Directors

Avnets goal is to provide the highest value relationships
to its customers, suppliers, employees and shareholders
globally. The Avnet board of directors believes that the Kent
acquisition serves Avnets objectives to each of these
constituencies.

Avnets customers will see new products and services
available from Avnet as a result of the addition of Kents
data communication services to Avnets global service
offerings and the consolidation of Kents components
division with Avnets interconnect, passive and
electromechanical (IP&E) business. Avnets
suppliers will now have access to the largest IP&E
distributor in North America.

Avnet management believes that the combination of its employees
with Kent employees will give the combined company a more highly
skilled organization. The Kent employees include senior managers
who are expected to fill leadership roles in the combined
company.

Avnet management believes that Avnets shareholders will
benefit in a variety of ways. The Kent acquisition fits into
Avnets strategic plan to accelerate its earnings growth
rate through increased product focus and specialization and to
increase revenues that are less subject to the cyclicality of
the semiconductor industry. In addition, Avnet management
believes that significant cost savings and synergies will result
from combining the companies, for example in consolidating their
facilities and computer systems. The Kent acquisition will also
strengthen Avnets financial position by contributing
strong earnings and operating cash flow which, coupled with
Kents strong balance sheet, will result in a favorable
improvement in Avnets debt to capital ratio and other
credit data.

The Avnet board of directors has unanimously approved the
merger agreement and recommends that Avnet shareholders vote FOR
approval of the merger agreement.

Opinion of Kents Financial Advisor

Credit Suisse First Boston has acted as Kents financial
advisor in connection with the merger. Kent selected Credit
Suisse First Boston based on Credit Suisse First Bostons
experience, expertise and reputation, and its familiarity with
Kents business. Credit Suisse First Boston is an
internationally recognized investment banking firm and is
regularly engaged in the valuation of businesses and securities
in connection with mergers and acquisitions, leveraged buyouts,
negotiated underwritings, competitive biddings, secondary
distributions of listed and unlisted securities, private
placements and valuations for corporate and other purposes.

In connection with Credit Suisse First Bostons engagement,
Kent requested that Credit Suisse First Boston evaluate the
fairness, from a financial point of view, to the holders of Kent
common stock of the exchange ratio set forth in the merger
agreement. On March 21, 2001 at a meeting of the board of
directors of Kent held to evaluate the merger, Credit Suisse
First Boston rendered to the board of directors of Kent an oral
opinion, which opinion was confirmed by delivery of a written
opinion dated March 21, 2001, to the effect that, as of
that date and based on and subject to the matters described in
the opinion, the exchange ratio was fair, from a financial point
of view, to the holders of Kent common stock.

The full text of Credit Suisse First Bostons written
opinion dated March 21, 2001 to the board of directors of
Kent, which sets forth, among other things, the procedures
followed, assumptions made, matters considered and limitations
on the review undertaken, is attached as Appendix D to this
proxy statement/ prospectus and is incorporated into this proxy
statement/ prospectus by reference. Holders of Kent common stock
are encouraged to, and should, read this opinion carefully and
in its entirety. Credit Suisse First Bostons opinion is
addressed to the board of directors of Kent and relates only to
the fairness of the exchange ratio, from a financial point of
view, to the holders of Kent common stock, does not address any
other aspect of the merger or any related transaction and does
not constitute a recommendation to any shareholder as to any
matter relating to the merger. The summary of Credit Suisse
First Bostons opinion in this proxy statement/ prospectus
is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of
the opinion.

In arriving at its opinion, Credit Suisse First Boston reviewed
certain publicly available business and financial information
relating to Kent and Avnet, as well as the merger agreement and
certain related documents including the stock option agreement
dated as of March 21, 2001 between Avnet and Kent and the
inducement agreements dated as of March 21, 2001 between
Avnet and certain shareholders of Kent. Credit Suisse First
Boston also reviewed certain other information, including
financial forecasts, provided to or discussed with it by Kent
and Avnet, and met with Kents and Avnets managements
to discuss the business and prospects of Kent and Avnet. Credit
Suisse First Boston also considered certain financial and stock
market data of Kent and Avnet, and compared those data with
similar data for other publicly held companies in businesses
similar to Kent and Avnet. Credit Suisse First Boston also
considered such other information, financial studies, analyses
and investigations and financial, economic and market criteria
which it deemed relevant. Credit Suisse First Boston relied upon
the views of Kents and Avnets managements concerning
the business, operational and strategic benefits and
implications of the merger, including financial forecasts
provided to it by Kent and Avnet relating to the synergistic
values and operating cost savings expected to be achieved
through the combination of the operations of Kent and Avnet.

In connection with its review, Credit Suisse First Boston did
not assume any responsibility for independent verification of
any of the foregoing information and has relied on its being
complete and accurate in all material respects. With respect to
the financial forecasts, Credit Suisse First Boston assumed that
they had been reasonably prepared on bases reflecting the best
currently available estimates and judgments of Kents and
Avnets managements as to the future financial performance
of Kent and Avnet and as to the cost savings and other potential
synergies (including the amount, timing and achievability
thereof) anticipated to result from the merger. In addition,
Credit Suisse First Boston relied upon, without independent
verification, the assessment of the managements of Kent and
Avnet as to (i) Kents and Avnets existing
services, technology and products and validity of, and risks
associated with, Kents and Avnets future services,
technology and products, (ii) their ability to integrate
the businesses of Kent and Avnet and (iii) their ability to
retain key employees of Kent and Avnet. Kent informed Credit
Suisse First Boston, and Credit Suisse First Boston assumed,
that the merger will be treated as a tax-free reorganization for
federal income tax purposes

and accounted for as a pooling of interests in accordance with
generally accepted accounting principles. In addition, Credit
Suisse First Boston was not requested to make, and did not make,
an independent evaluation or appraisal of the assets or
liabilities (contingent or otherwise) of Kent or Avnet. In
connection with its engagement, Credit Suisse First Boston was
not requested to, and it did not, solicit third party
indications of interest in the possible acquisition of all or a
part of Kent. Credit Suisse First Bostons opinion does not
address the relative merits of the merger as compared to other
business strategies that might be available to Kent nor does it
address Kents underlying business decision to engage in
the merger. Credit Suisse First Bostons opinion is
necessarily based upon information available to it and
financial, economic, market and other conditions as they exist
and can be evaluated on the date hereof. Credit Suisse First
Boston did not express any opinion as to the actual value of
Avnet common stock when issued to holders of Kent common stock
pursuant to the merger or the prices at which Avnet common stock
will trade at any time.

In preparing its opinion to the board of directors of Kent,
Credit Suisse First Boston performed a variety of financial and
comparative analyses, including those described below. The
summary of Credit Suisse First Bostons analyses described
below is not a complete description of the analyses underlying
Credit Suisse First Bostons opinion. The preparation of a
fairness opinion is a complex process involving various
determinations as to the most appropriate and relevant methods
of financial analyses and the application of those methods to
the particular circumstances and, therefore, a fairness opinion
is not readily susceptible to partial analysis or summary
description. In arriving at its opinion, Credit Suisse First
Boston made qualitative judgments as to the significance and
relevance of each analysis and factor that it considered.
Accordingly, Credit Suisse First Boston believes that its
analyses must be considered as a whole and that selecting
portions of its analyses and factors or the narrative
description of the analyses could create a misleading or
incomplete view of the processes underlying its analyses and
opinion.

In its analyses, Credit Suisse First Boston considered industry
performance, regulatory, general business, economic, market and
financial conditions and other matters, many of which are beyond
the control of Avnet and Kent. No company, transaction or
business used in Credit Suisse First Bostons analyses as a
comparison is identical to Avnet or Kent or the merger, and an
evaluation of the results of those analyses is not entirely
mathematical. Rather, the analyses involved complex
considerations and judgments concerning financial and operating
characteristics and other facts that could affect the
acquisition, public trading or other values of the companies,
business segments or transactions being analyzed. The estimates
contained in Credit Suisse First Bostons analyses and the
ranges of valuations resulting from any particular analysis are
not necessarily indicative of actual values or predictive of
future results or values, which may be significantly more or
less favorable than those suggested by the analyses. In
addition, analyses relating to the value of businesses or
securities do not purport to be appraisals or to reflect the
prices at which businesses or securities actually may be sold.
Accordingly, Credit Suisse First Bostons analyses and
estimates are inherently subject to substantial uncertainty.

Credit Suisse First Bostons opinion and financial analyses
was only one of many factors considered by the board of
directors of Kent in its evaluation of the merger and should not
be viewed as determinative of the views of the board of
directors of Kent or its management with respect to the merger
or the exchange ratio.

The following is a summary of the material financial analyses
performed by Credit Suisse First Boston in connection with the
preparation of its opinion and reviewed with the board of
directors of Kent at its meeting held on March 21, 2001.

The financial analyses summarized below include information
presented in tabular format. In order to fully understand Credit
Suisse First Bostons financial analyses, the tables must
be read together with the text of each summary. The tables alone
do not constitute a complete description of the financial
analyses. Considering the data set forth in the tables below
without considering the full narrative description of the
financial analyses, including the methodologies and assumptions
underlying the analyses, could create a misleading or incomplete
view of Credit Suisse First Bostons financial analyses.

Common Stock Trading History. 
Credit Suisse First Boston
examined the historical closing prices of Kent common stock from
March 16, 2000 to March 19, 2001. During this time
period, Kent common stock reached a high of $34.50 per
share and a low of $13.50 per share and had an average
price of $24.09 per share. Credit Suisse First Boston also
examined the historical closing prices of Avnet common stock
from March 16,

2000 to March 19, 2001. During this time period, Avnet
common stock reached a high of $39.31 per share and a low
of $17.50 per share and had an average price of
$28.83 per share.

Comparable Publicly Traded Company Analysis.
 Credit
Suisse First Boston analyzed the equity values and trading
multiples of selected publicly traded companies in the
electronics distribution industry that Credit Suisse First
Boston believed were reasonably comparable to both Kent and
Avnet. These comparable companies were:

 

	Arrow Electronics, Inc.

 

	Nu Horizons Electronics Corp.

 

	Pioneer-Standard Electronics, Inc.

 

	Reptron Electronics, Inc.

In examining these comparable companies, Credit Suisse First
Boston calculated the enterprise value of each company as a
multiple of its respective: (i) LTM revenue and projected
calendar year 2001 revenue and (ii) LTM EBITDA and EBIT and
projected calendar year 2001 EBITDA and EBIT. The enterprise
value of a company is equal to the value of its fully-diluted
common equity value plus debt and the liquidation value of
outstanding preferred stock, if any, plus the value of minority
interests, if any, minus cash and cash equivalents, including
unconsolidated investments in other entities. LTM means the last
twelve-month period for which financial data for the company at
issue has been reported. EBITDA means earnings before interest
expense, taxes, depreciation and amortization. EBIT means
earnings before interest expense and taxes. Credit Suisse First
Boston also calculated the trading price of each companys
stock as a multiple of such companys projected calendar
year 2001 and 2002 EPS. EPS means earnings per share. All
historical data was derived from publicly available sources and
all projected data was obtained from research analyst consensus
estimates. Trading prices and equity values used in calculating
the following ranges are as of March 19, 2001. All other
data used in calculating enterprise value are as of
December 31, 2000. Credit Suisse First Bostons
analysis of the comparable companies yielded the following
multiple ranges:

Based on an analysis of this data and historical and projected
results for comparable periods provided by Kents
management, Credit Suisse First Boston estimated a theoretical
value per share of Kent common stock ranging from approximately
$13.00 to approximately $18.00. Based on an analysis of this
data and historical and projected results for comparable periods
provided by Avnets management, Credit Suisse First Boston
estimated a theoretical value per share of Avnet common stock
ranging from approximately $20.00 to approximately $31.00.

Based on these results, Credit Suisse First Boston derived
implied exchange ratios ranging from approximately 0.419 to
approximately 0.900 (which were obtained by dividing the lowest
estimated valuation of Kent common stock by the highest
estimated valuation of Avnet common stock, and by dividing the
highest estimated valuation of Kent common stock by the lowest
estimated valuation of Avnet common stock), compared to the
proposed exchange ratio of 0.870.

Discounted Cash Flow Analysis.
 Credit Suisse First Boston
performed a DCF analysis of the projected cash flows of Kent for
the fiscal years ending March 31, 2002 through
March 31, 2006, using projections and assumptions provided
by the management of Kent. DCF means discounted cash flow. The
DCFs for Kent were estimated using discount rates ranging from
11.0% to 13.0%, based on estimates related to the weighted
average costs of capital of Kent, and terminal multiples of
estimated EBITDA for Kents fiscal year ending

March 31, 2006 ranging from 4.5x to 6.5x. Based on this
analysis, Credit Suisse First Boston estimated a theoretical
value per share of Kent common stock ranging from approximately
$28.00 to approximately $34.00

Credit Suisse First Boston also performed a DCF analysis of the
projected cash flows of Avnet for the fiscal quarter ending
June 30, 2001 through the fiscal quarter ending
March 31, 2006, using projections and assumptions provided
by the management of Avnet. The DCFs for Avnet were estimated
using discount rates ranging from 10.5% to 12.5%, based on
estimates related to the weighted average costs of capital of
Avnet, and terminal multiples of estimated EBITDA for
Avnets projected twelve months ending March 31, 2006
ranging from 5.0x to 7.0x. Based on this analysis, Credit Suisse
First Boston estimated a theoretical value per share of Avnet
common stock ranging from approximately $32.00 to approximately
$47.00.

Based on these results, Credit Suisse First Boston derived
implied exchange ratios ranging from approximately 0.596 to
approximately 1.063 (which were obtained by dividing the lowest
estimated valuation of Kent common stock by the highest
estimated valuation of Avnet common stock, and by dividing the
highest estimated valuation of Kent common stock by the lowest
estimated valuation of Avnet common stock), compared to the
proposed exchange ratio of 0.870.

Contribution Analysis. 
Credit Suisse First Boston
analyzed the relative contributions of Kent and Avnet to the pro
forma combined company for the calendar year ended
December 31, 2000 based on revenues, EBITDA, EBIT and net
income, assuming no anticipated cost savings or related
expenses. Credit Suisse First Boston also analyzed the
respective contributions of each companys projected
revenues, EBITDA, EBIT and net income, for the calendar year
ending December 31, 2001 based on estimates provided by the
managements of Kent and Avnet, assuming no anticipated cost
savings or related expenses. The implied percent of equity value
and implied exchange ratio in the table below denotes each
respective companys share of pro forma equity and the
resulting exchange ratio based on its contribution to enterprise
value, accounting for the debt and cash as of December 31,
2000 contributed by each of Kent and Avnet, respectively:

Pro Forma Financial Impact Analysis.
 Using projections
provided by the managements of Kent and Avnet, Credit Suisse
First Boston, in its presentation to the Kent board of directors
on March 21, 2001, compared the projected EPS of Avnet for
the fiscal years ending June 30, 2001 and June 30,
2002 on a stand-alone basis to the projected pro forma EPS for
fiscal years ending June 30, 2001 and June 30, 2002 of
the combined company after the merger. Credit Suisse First
Boston performed this analysis both assuming no synergies from
cost savings and assuming $60 million in pre-tax synergies
arising from cost savings projected by the managements of Kent
and Avnet to arise from the merger. In making its pro forma
analysis for the purposes of rendering its opinion, Credit
Suisse First Boston relied only on the pro forma financial
analysis for

the fiscal year ending June 30, 2002, which is projected to
be the first full fiscal year following the merger. This
analysis showed that the merger would be expected to have the
following effects:

Miscellaneous.
 Kent has agreed to pay Credit Suisse First
Boston for its financial advisory services in connection with
the merger a fee that is customary in transactions of this
nature, a substantial portion of which is contingent upon the
consummation of the merger. Kent also has agreed to reimburse
Credit Suisse First Boston for its reasonable out-of-pocket
expenses, including fees and expenses of legal counsel and any
other advisor retained by Credit Suisse First Boston, and to
indemnify Credit Suisse First Boston and related parties against
liabilities, including liabilities under the federal securities
laws, arising out of its engagement.

Credit Suisse First Boston and its affiliates have in the past
performed certain investment banking services for Kent and Avnet
and have received customary fees for those services. In the
ordinary course of business, Credit Suisse First Boston and its
affiliates may actively trade the debt and equity securities of
Kent and Avnet for their own accounts and for the account of
customers and, accordingly, may at any time hold long or short
positions in such securities.

Opinion of Avnets Financial Advisor

Avnet retained Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith
Incorporated to act as its financial advisor in connection with
the proposed merger. On March 21, 2001, Merrill Lynch
delivered to the Avnet board of directors an oral opinion,
subsequently confirmed by delivery of a written opinion dated
March 21, 2001, to the effect that, as of that date, and
based upon and subject to the factors and assumptions set forth
in the opinion, the exchange ratio was fair, from a financial
point of view, to Avnet.

The full text of Merrill Lynchs opinion, dated
March 21, 2001, which sets forth the assumptions made,
matters considered, and qualifications and limitations on the
review undertaken by Merrill Lynch, is attached as Appendix E to
this document and is incorporated into this document by
reference. The summary of Merrill Lynchs opinion set forth
below is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text
of the opinion. Avnet shareholders are urged to read the opinion
carefully in its entirety.

Merrill Lynchs opinion was addressed to the Avnet board of
directors for its information and is directed only to the
fairness, from a financial point of view, of the exchange ratio
to Avnet, does not address any other aspect of the merger,
including the merits of the underlying decision by Avnet to
engage in the merger, and does not constitute a recommendation
to any Avnet shareholder as to how the shareholder should vote
as to any matter relating to the merger.

In preparing its opinion to the Avnet board of directors,
Merrill Lynch performed a variety of financial and comparative
analyses, including those described below. The summary set forth
below does not purport to be a complete description of the
analyses underlying Merrill Lynchs opinion or the
presentation made by Merrill Lynch to the Avnet board of
directors. The preparation of a fairness opinion is a complex
analytic process involving various determinations as to the most
appropriate and relevant methods of financial analysis and the
application of those methods to the particular circumstances
and, therefore, a fairness opinion is not readily susceptible to
partial analysis or summary description. In arriving at its
opinion, Merrill Lynch did not attribute any particular weight
to any analysis or factor considered by it, but rather made
qualitative judgments as to the significance and relevance of
each analysis and factor. Accordingly, Merrill Lynch believes
that its analyses must be considered as a whole and that
selecting portions of its analyses and factors, or focusing on
information presented in tabular format, without considering all
of the analyses and factors or the narrative description of the
analyses, would create a misleading or incomplete view of the
process underlying its opinion.

In performing its analyses, Merrill Lynch made numerous
assumptions with respect to industry performance, general
business, economic, market and financial conditions and other
matters, many of which are beyond the control of Merrill Lynch,
Avnet or Kent. Any estimates contained in the analyses performed
by

Merrill Lynch are not necessarily indicative of actual values or
future results, which may be significantly more or less
favorable than suggested by such analyses. Additionally,
estimates of the value of businesses or securities do not
purport to be appraisals or to reflect the prices at which such
businesses or securities might actually be sold. Accordingly,
such analyses and estimates are inherently subject to
substantial uncertainty. In addition, as described above,
Merrill Lynchs opinion was among several factors taken
into consideration by the Avnet board of directors in making its
determination to approve the merger agreement and the merger.
Consequently, Merrill Lynchs analyses should not be viewed
as determinative of the decision of the Avnet board of directors
or Avnets management with respect to the fairness of the
exchange ratio set forth in the merger agreement.

In arriving at its opinion, Merrill Lynch, among other things,
did the following:

(1) 

	reviewed publicly available business and financial information
	relating to Avnet and Kent that Merrill Lynch deemed to be
	relevant;

(2) 

	reviewed information, including financial forecasts, relating to
	the business, earnings, cash flows, assets, liabilities and
	prospects of Avnet and Kent, as well as the amount and timing of
	potential cost savings and related expenses and potential
	revenue synergies expected to result from the merger furnished
	to or discussed with Merrill Lynch by Avnet and Kent;

(3) 

	conducted discussions with members of senior management and
	representatives of Avnet and Kent concerning the matters
	described in clauses (1) and (2) above, as well as
	their respective businesses and prospects both before and after
	giving effect to the merger and potential cost savings and
	related expenses and potential revenue synergies expected to
	result from the merger;

(4) 

	reviewed the market prices and valuation multiples for
	Avnets common stock and Kents common stock and
	compared them with those of publicly traded companies that
	Merrill Lynch deemed to be relevant;

(5) 

	reviewed the results of operations of Avnet and Kent and
	compared them with those of publicly traded companies that
	Merrill Lynch deemed to be relevant;

(6) 

	compared the proposed financial terms of the merger with the
	financial terms of other transactions that Merrill Lynch deemed
	to be relevant;

(7) 

	participated in discussions and negotiations among
	representatives of Avnet and Kent and their respective financial
	and legal advisors;

(8) 

	reviewed the potential pro forma impact of the merger;

(9) 

	reviewed the merger agreement; and

(10) 

	reviewed other financial studies and analyses and took into
	account other matters as Merrill Lynch deemed necessary,
	including Merrill Lynchs assessment of general economic,
	market and monetary conditions.

In preparing its opinion, Merrill Lynch assumed and relied on
the accuracy and completeness of all information supplied or
otherwise made available to Merrill Lynch, discussed with or
reviewed by Merrill Lynch or publicly available, and did not
assume any responsibility for independently verifying such
information and Merrill Lynch did not undertake an independent
evaluation or appraisal of any of the assets or liabilities of
Avnet or Kent, and was not furnished with any evaluations or
appraisals. In addition, Merrill Lynch did not assume any
obligation to conduct, nor did it conduct, any physical
inspection of the properties or facilities of Avnet or Kent.
With respect to the financial forecast information and the
information concerning potential cost savings and related
expenses and potential revenue synergies expected to result from
the merger furnished to or discussed with Merrill Lynch by Avnet
or Kent, Merrill Lynch assumed that they have been reasonably
prepared and reflect the best currently available estimates and
judgments of the managements of Avnet or Kent as to the expected
future financial performance of Avnet or Kent, as the case may
be, and the potential cost savings and related expenses and
potential revenue synergies expected to result

from the merger. Merrill Lynch further assumed that the merger
will qualify as a tax-free reorganization for United States
federal income tax purposes.

Merrill Lynchs opinion is necessarily based upon market,
economic and other conditions as they existed on, and on the
information made available to Merrill Lynch as of, the date of
the opinion. Merrill Lynch did not express any opinion as to the
prices at which the Avnet common stock will trade subsequent to
the merger. Although Merrill Lynch evaluated the fairness, from
a financial point of view, of the exchange ratio, Merrill Lynch
was not requested to, and did not, recommend the specific
consideration payable in the merger, which consideration was
determined through negotiations between Avnet and Kent and
approved by the Avnet board of directors. No other limitation
was imposed on Merrill Lynch with respect to the investigations
made or procedures followed by Merrill Lynch in rendering its
opinion.

Financial Analysis. 
The following is a summary of the
material analyses performed by Merrill Lynch in connection with
its opinion to the Avnet board of directors dated March 21,
2001. 
Some of the financial analyses summarized below include
information presented in tabular format. In order to understand
fully Merrill Lynchs financial analyses, the tables must
be read together with the text of the summary. The tables alone
do not constitute a complete description of the financial
analyses. Considering the data set forth below without
considering the full narrative description of the financial
analyses, including the methodologies and assumptions underlying
the analyses, could create a misleading or incomplete view of
Merrill Lynchs financial analyses.

Selected Companies Analysis

Merrill Lynch compared financial, operating and stock market
data of Avnet and Kent to corresponding data of the following
selected publicly traded companies:

 

	Arrow Electronics, Inc.

 

	Avnet, in the analysis of Kent

 

	Kent, in the analysis of Avnet

 

	Pioneer Standard Electronics, Inc.

Merrill Lynch reviewed enterprise value, calculated as equity
market value, plus total debt, preferred stock and minority
investments, less cash and cash equivalents, of the selected
companies as a multiple of earnings before interest and taxes,
commonly referred to as EBIT, earnings before interest, taxes,
depreciation and amortization, commonly referred to as EBITDA,
and price as a multiple of earnings per share, in each case for
estimated fiscal year 2001. All multiples were based on closing
stock prices on March 16, 2001. Estimated financial data
for the selected companies were based on publicly available
research analysts estimates. Merrill Lynch then applied a
range of selected multiples for the selected companies to
estimates of the corresponding financial data for Avnet and
Kent, which were provided by the managements of Avnet and Kent,
respectively, and, in the case of Kent, both before and after
taking into account potential cost savings and related expenses
and potential revenue synergies expected to result from the
merger. This analysis indicated an implied equity reference
range for Avnet of approximately $13.00 to $25.25 per share and
an implied equity reference range for Kent of approximately
$9.75 to $29.75 per share.

Merrill Lynch then compared the implied per share equity
reference ranges for Avnet and Kent described above in order to
derive an implied exchange ratio reference range for Avnet and
Kent. This analysis indicated an implied exchange ratio
reference range of approximately 0.400x to 1.250x.

None of the selected companies is identical to Avnet or Kent.
Accordingly, an analysis of the results of the selected
companies analysis involves complex considerations of the
selected companies and other factors that could affect the
public trading value of Avnet, Kent and the selected companies.

Discounted Cash Flow Analysis

Avnet. 
Merrill Lynch estimated the present value of the
stand-alone, unlevered, after-tax free cash flows that Avnet
could produce over the fiscal years 2001 through 2006 based on
estimates of the management of Avnet. Ranges of terminal values
were derived using multiples of estimated fiscal year 2007
EBITDA of 4.0x to 6.0x. The free cash flows and terminal values
were then discounted to present value using discount rates of
9.0% to 11.0%. This analysis indicated an implied equity
reference range for Avnet of approximately $21.00 to $51.50 per
share.

Kent. 
Merrill Lynch estimated the present value of the
stand-alone, unlevered, after-tax free cash flows that Kent
could produce over the fiscal years 2001 through 2006 based on
two scenarios. The first scenario was based on estimates of the
management of Kent. The second scenario was based on estimates
of the management of Kent, which were adjusted to assume
achievement of only 75% of the growth targets estimated by the
management of Kent and selling, general and administrative
expenses margins as a percentage of revenue equal to fiscal year
2002 levels. In addition, each of the scenarios were analyzed
both before and after taking into account potential cost savings
and related expenses, potential revenue synergies and severance
costs expected to result from the merger. Ranges of terminal
values were derived using multiples of estimated fiscal year
ending 2007 EBITDA of 4.0x to 6.0x. The free cash flows and
terminal values were then discounted to present value using
discount rates of 10.0% to 14.0%. This analysis indicated the
following approximate implied per share equity reference ranges
for Kent:

Implied Per Share Equity Reference Ranges

Scenario I

Scenario II

	$28.50 to $61.00

	$14.00 to $36.75

Merrill Lynch then compared the implied per share equity
reference ranges for Avnet and Kent described above in order to
derive an implied exchange ratio reference range for Avnet and
Kent. This analysis indicated implied exchange ratio reference
ranges of 0.900x to 1.720x based on scenario I and 0.435x to
1.050x based on scenario II.

Selected Merger and Acquisition
Analysis

Using publicly available information, Merrill Lynch analyzed,
among other things, the purchase prices and implied transaction
multiples paid or proposed to be paid in the following selected
transactions:

Acquiror

Target

	 Arrow Electronics, Inc.

	 Bell Industries, Inc.s Electronics
	Distribution Group

	 Arrow Electronics, Inc.

	 Premier Farnell Corporations Volume
	Distribution Business

	 Arrow Electronics, Inc.

	 Richey Electronics, Inc.

	 Arrow Electronics, Inc.

	 Wyle Electronics (Veba Electronics Group)

	 Avnet

	 EBV Group (Veba Electronics Group)

	 Avnet

	 Marshall Industries

	 Bell Industries, Inc.

	 Milgray Electronics, Inc.

	 Marshall Industries

	 Sterling Electronics Corporation

	 Veba Electronics Group

	 Wyle Electronics

Merrill Lynch reviewed enterprise values of the selected
transactions as multiples of latest twelve months sales, EBITDA
and EBIT and equity values as multiples of latest twelve months
net income. Merrill Lynch then applied a range of selected
multiples derived from the selected transactions to estimated
fiscal year 2001 sales, EBITDA, EBIT and net income for Kent.
All multiples for the selected transactions were based on
financial information available at the time of the announcement
of the relevant transaction. Estimated

financial data for Kent was based on estimates provided by the
management of Kent. This analysis indicated an implied equity
reference range for Kent of approximately $17.25 to $24.40 per
share.

No company or transaction used in the selected merger and
acquisition analysis is identical to Avnet, Kent or the proposed
merger. Accordingly, an analysis of the results of the selected
merger and acquisition analysis involves complex considerations
of the companies involved and the transactions and other factors
that could affect the acquisition value of the companies and
Kent.

Relative Contribution Analysis

Using estimated financial data for Avnet and Kent, Merrill Lynch
analyzed the relative contributions of Avnet and Kent to the
combined companys revenue, EBITDA and net income for
fiscal years 2001 and 2002 after taking into account the
relative capital structures of Avnet and Kent and after taking
into account potential cost savings and related expenses and
potential revenue synergies expected to result from the merger
under two scenarios. The potential cost savings and related
expenses and potential revenue synergies expected to result from
the merger were credited to Kent on both a 50% basis and a 100%
basis. Merrill Lynch then computed exchange ratios implied by
the ownership percentages of Kents stockholders in the
combined company implied by Kents relative contribution
for each operational metric observed. This analysis indicated a
mean implied exchange ratio reference range for Avnet and Kent
of approximately 0.839x to 1.197x.

Pro Forma Merger Analysis

Merrill Lynch analyzed the potential pro forma effect of the
merger on Avnets estimated earnings per share, commonly
referred to as EPS, in fiscal years 2001 and 2002, based on
three scenarios. The first scenario, the street-to-street case,
was based on publicly available research analysts
estimates. The second scenario, the modified street case, was
based on publicly available research analysts estimates of
earnings per share for Avnet and Kent and estimates provided by
the management of Avnet of the number of outstanding shares of
Avnet common stock on a fully diluted basis. The third scenario,
the management-to-management case, was based on estimates of
earnings per share of Avnet and Kent provided by the managements
of Avnet and Kent, respectively, and estimates provided by the
management of Avnet of the number of outstanding shares of Avnet
common stock on a fully diluted basis. In addition, each of the
street-to-street case, the modified street case and the
management-to-management case were analyzed under both the
pooling of interests accounting rules and the proposed Financial
Accounting Standards Board rules on accounting for business
combinations. Based on the exchange ratio of 0.870x in the
merger, this analysis indicated that, assuming
pooling-of-interests accounting, the proposed merger could be
accretive to Avnets estimated earnings per share in fiscal
year 2002 under the modified case and in fiscal years 2001 and
2002 under the management-to-management case. The actual results
achieved by the combined company may vary from projected results
and the variations may be material.

Other Factors

In the course of preparing its opinion, Merrill Lynch also
reviewed and considered other information and data, including
the following:

 

	the trading characteristics of Avnet and Kent;

 

	historical market prices for Avnet common stock and Kent common
	stock over the last 52-weeks;

 

	the relative exchange ratio of Avnet common stock and Kent
	common stock over the last 52-weeks;

 

	historical and projected financial data for Avnet and Kent; and

 

	selected research analysts reports for Kent, including
	stock price estimates of those analysts.

Miscellaneous

Pursuant to the terms of Merrill Lynchs engagement, Avnet
has agreed to pay Merrill Lynch for its financial advisory
services in connection with the merger a fee of $3.5 million, a
significant portion of which is

contingent upon the closing of the merger. Avnet also has agreed
to reimburse Merrill Lynch for reasonable out-of-pocket expenses
incurred by Merrill Lynch in performing its services and to
indemnify Merrill Lynch and related persons and entities against
liabilities, including liabilities under the federal securities
laws, arising out of Merrill Lynchs engagement.

Avnet retained Merrill Lynch based upon Merrill Lynchs
experience and expertise. Merrill Lynch is an internationally
recognized investment banking and advisory firm. Merrill Lynch,
as part of its investment banking business, is regularly engaged
in the valuation of businesses and securities in connection with
mergers and acquisitions, negotiated underwritings, competitive
biddings, secondary distributions of listed and unlisted
securities, private placements and valuations for corporate and
other purposes.

Merrill Lynch and its affiliates have in the past provided
financial services to Avnet unrelated to the proposed merger,
for which services Merrill Lynch and its affiliates have
received compensation. Merrill Lynch acted as Avnets
financial advisor in connection with Avnets
October 1999 acquisition of Marshall Industries and its
July 2000 acquisition of Savoir Technology Group, Inc.
Merrill Lynch also acted as one of the underwriters in the
public offering in February 2000 of Avnets 7 
7/8% Notes due February 15, 2005, and in the public
offerings in October 2000 of $325 million principal amount
of Avnets Floating Rate Notes due October 17, 2001,
and $250,000,000 principal amount of 8.20% Notes due
October 17, 2003. In addition, Merrill Lynch Capital
Corporation, an affiliate of Merrill Lynch has been or continues
to be one of the agents, arrangers, book managers or lenders
under various credit facilities with Avnet. Merrill Lynch
Capital Corporation and its affiliates may serve in the same or
similar capacities in the future under credit facilities with
Avnet, and Merrill Lynch and its affiliates may engage in other
general financing and banking transactions, including investment
banking transactions, with Avnet.

In the ordinary course of business, Merrill Lynch and its
affiliates may actively trade in the securities of Avnet and
Kent for their own accounts and for the accounts of customers
and, accordingly, may at any time hold a long or short position
in such securities.

Interests of Certain Persons in the Merger and Possible
Conflicts of Interest

In considering the respective recommendations of the Kent board
of directors and the Avnet board of directors, Kent shareholders
and Avnet shareholders should be aware that certain members of
Kents senior management and board of directors have
interests in the merger that are different from, or in addition
to, the interests of Kents shareholders generally. The
members of the Kent board of directors and the Avnet board of
directors knew about these additional interests, and considered
them, when they approved the merger agreement.

Stock Options

Upon completion of the merger, Avnet will assume Kents
obligations under all of Kents employee and director stock
options, which will become options to purchase Avnet shares in a
number and at an exercise price which will be adjusted to
reflect the exchange ratio for the merger. See The Merger
Agreement  Covenants  Stock Options
on page 63. In addition, Avnet will, as promptly as
practicable after the closing of the merger, register the Avnet
shares issuable upon exercise of the options under the
Securities Act to enable the holders of converted options to
publicly sell any Avnet shares that they acquire by exercising
their converted options.

Currently, the executive officers and directors of Kent and
their children transferees are the holders of options to
purchase an aggregate of 1,880,564 shares of Kent common stock
at prices ranging from $7.25 to

$40.13 per share. The following table sets forth
information as to these Kent options and how they will be
converted into Avnet options.

Agreements with Management

Morrie K. Abramson, a co-founder and the chairman of the board
of Kent and until June 29, 2000, its chief executive
officer, retired as an employee on March 31, 2001, and
pursuant to his employment agreement with Kent, effective
April 1, 2001, he became entitled to receive an annual
retirement benefit in the amount of $852,000 per year, subject
to annual cost of living adjustments based on the consumer price
index. This benefit is payable to Mr. Abramson, his wife or his
estate until the last to occur of April 1, 2016, his death
and the death of his wife if she is married to him at the time
of his death. The employment agreement has been amended, with
Avnets consent, to provide that, concurrently with the
closing of the merger, Kent will pay to Mr. Abramson a lump sum
of $25,068,000, less the value of monthly payments of the
retirement benefit paid from April 1, 2001, through the
closing of the merger. Kent and Mr. Abramson have agreed
that this lump sum payment will fully discharge Kents
obligation to Mr. Abramson with respect to his retirement
benefit. The $25,068,000 represents the sum of (a) the
estimated amount sufficient to purchase an annuity contract that
would provide the after-tax equivalent of the retirement
benefit, based on a 5% assumed annual increase in the consumer
price index, and (b) the estimated amount of federal and
state income taxes payable on the amount described in (a).

In addition, effective April 1, 2001, Mr. Abramson
began to receive compensation under a consulting agreement with
Kent. This agreement provides that during a term beginning
April 1, 2001, and ending April 1, 2006, or sooner as
otherwise provided, he will receive a consulting fee from Kent
at the annual rate of $250,000. When the consulting agreement
terminates, Mr. Abramson, his wife or his estate would be
entitled to continue receiving an annuity in the amount of
$250,000 per year, subject to cost of living adjustments based
on the consumer price index, until the last to occur of
(1) fifteen years after termination, (2) his death and
(3) the death of his wife if she is married to him at the
time of his death. The consulting agreement will be terminated
concurrently with the merger, and in accordance with the early
termination provisions of the consulting agreement, as amended
with Avnets consent, Kent will pay to Mr. Abramson a
lump sum of $6,092,000, which Kent and Mr. Abramson have
agreed will fully discharge Kents obligation to
Mr. Abramson with respect to the above annuity. The
$6,092,000 represents the sum of (a) the estimated amount
sufficient to purchase an annuity contract that would provide
the after-tax equivalent of the $250,000 annuity amount, based
on a 5% assumed annual increase in the consumer price index,
plus (b) the estimated amount of federal and state income
taxes payable on the amount described in (a), less
(c) $1,250,000 as agreed between Mr. Abramson and
Avnet.

Kent shareholder approval of the merger would be a change
in control of Kent as defined in Mr. Abramsons
consulting agreement. Upon the termination of Mr.
Abramsons consulting agreement in connection with the
merger, Mr. Abramson would be entitled, under the terms of
that agreement, to receive certain additional payments
(Additional Termination Payments) which in the
aggregate are expected to equal approximately $22,910,000.

If Mr. Abramson is deemed to have received excess
parachute payments as defined in Section 280G of the
Internal Revenue Code with respect to any compensation payable
to him under the consulting agreement, Kent will pay him an
additional amount to the extent necessary to hold him harmless
from the effects of any federal excise taxes imposed on
excess parachute payments. The payments to
Mr. Abramson that may be subject to Section 280G
include (1) the accelerated payment of his post-termination
compensation under the consulting agreement, and (2) the
Additional Termination Payments described above. Without giving
consideration to any alternatives that might be available for
mitigation of the effect of these excise taxes, Kent would be
obligated to make a payment to Mr. Abramson of
approximately $13,437,000.

To the extent that any payment required to be made to
Mr. Abramson under the consulting agreement were treated as
an excess parachute payment under Section 280G, neither the
payment so made, nor any additional amount paid to
Mr. Abramson to hold him harmless from the excise tax
imposed on such payment, would be deductible by Kent for federal
income tax purposes.

Mr. Abramson and his wife are entitled to receive lifetime
health coverage from Kent for medical, dental and prescription
drug expenses not covered by Medicare.

Avnet has entered into employment agreements with Larry D.
Olson, Kents chief executive officer and president, and
Mark A. Zerbe, an executive vice president of Kent. These
agreements are effective as of the effective time of the merger
and will terminate on the second anniversary of the effective
time unless terminated earlier for cause, except that in the
case of Mr. Olson, his agreement will automatically renew
for additional one year terms until either Avnet or
Mr. Olson gives at least one years advance notice of
termination.

Mr. Olson will serve as president of a new specialty
components division of Avnets Electronics Marketing Group,
which will include the former operations of Kent. Mr. Zerbe
will serve as head of the Datacomm division of Avnets
Computer Marketing Group. The employment agreements provide for
annual salary and incentive compensation aggregating not less
than $600,000 for Mr. Olson and $450,000 for Mr. Zerbe.

The merger will be a change in control of Kent as
defined in severance agreements between Kent and each of its
executive officers Frank M. Billone, Stephen J. Chapko,
Richard J. Hightower, David D. Johnson, Larry D. Olson, and
Mark A. Zerbe. In general, these agreements provide that if
after the merger any of these officers employment is
terminated for any reason, including death or retirement and
with or without cause, the terminated officer would be entitled
to a cash lump sum severance payment equal to the highest amount
of his annual cash compensation (two times that amount in the
case of Mr. Olson) during the five fiscal years preceding
the year of the change in control. The merger agreement permits
Kent to make these change in control payments to the abovenamed
executive officers concurrently with the closing of the merger,
even if their employment is not terminated. The estimated
payments will be as follows: Mr. Billone 
$433,572; Mr. Chapko  $1,153,522;
Mr. Hightower  $1,104,496;
Mr. Johnson  $815,000;
Mr. Olson  $5,216,000; and
Mr. Zerbe  $505,202. In addition, all unvested
employee stock options held by any of these executive officers
will immediately vest on the date of his termination after the
merger. See  Stock Options above. Also,
if a terminated officer is deemed to have received excess
parachute payments as defined in Section 280G of the
Internal Revenue Code with respect to his severance payment,
Kent will pay the terminated officer an additional amount
sufficient to pay all excise taxes applicable to the
excess parachute payments.

Indemnification; Directors and
Officers Insurance

Avnet has agreed that Kent, as the surviving corporation in the
merger, and Avnet will at all times after the effective time of
the merger indemnify each present and former Kent officer and
director to the fullest extent permitted by Texas law and
Kents articles of incorporation and by-laws, against
losses he or she incurs which arise out of or relate to service
as an officer or director before the effective time. Avnet has
also agreed that for six years after the effective time, it will
maintain directors and officers liability insurance
covering Kents pre-merger officers and directors who are
currently covered by Kents existing policies, on terms
substantially no less advantageous to them than Kents
existing insurance. See The Merger Agreement 
Covenants  Indemnification; Directors and
Officers Insurance on page 63.

Kents Convertible Notes

In September and October 1997, Kent issued $207,000,000 of
4.5% Convertible Subordinated Notes due 2004, under the terms of
an Indenture between Kent Electronics Corporation, as Issuer,
and Texas Commerce Bank National Association, as Trustee, dated
as of September 23, 1997. The notes are, at the
holders option, convertible into an aggregate of 4,179,285
shares of Kent common stock based on a conversion price of
$49.53 per share, subject to adjustment in certain events.
Interest is payable semi-annually on March 1 and September 1 of
each year, and the Notes are redeemable at the option of the
Company at set redemption prices (which is currently 101.93% of
principal and will be 101.29% of principal beginning
September 1, 2002, and 100.64% of principal beginning
September 1, 2003), plus accrued interest.

As a result of the merger, Avnet will assume Kents
obligations under the notes in accordance with the terms of the
indenture, and the notes will, at the holders option, be
convertible into an aggregate of 3,635,977 shares of Avnet
common stock (the 4,179,285 shares of Kent common stock
multiplied by the merger

exchange ratio (0.87)) at a conversion price of $56.93 per share
(the pre-merger conversion price of $49.53 divided by the merger
exchange ratio).

Under the indenture, the merger will be a change in
control and, therefore, will be a repurchase
event that will entitle each holder of notes, at the
holders option, to require Avnet to repurchase all or a
portion of such holders notes at a price equal to 100% of
the principal amount of the notes, plus accrued and unpaid
interest through the date of repurchase. Kent will be required
to give note holders notice within 15 days after the
occurrence of the repurchase event (that is, the closing of the
merger), and the note holders may exercise their repurchase
rights within 30 days after Kent gives the required notice.
If all note holders were to exercise their repurchase right with
respect to all of their notes, Avnet will be required to pay to
the holders $207,000,000 plus accrued and unpaid interest
through the date of repurchase.

Public Trading Markets

The Kent common stock is currently listed on the New York Stock
Exchange under the symbol KNT. Upon consummation of
the merger, the Kent common stock will be delisted from the
Exchange and deregistered under the Securities Exchange Act of
1934.

The Avnet common stock is currently listed on the New York Stock
Exchange and the Pacific Exchange under the symbol
AVT and will continue to be listed on both exchanges
after the merger. See Market Price and Dividend
Information.

No Dissenters Rights

Article 5.11 of the Texas Business Corporation Act provides
that a shareholder of a Texas corporation may have the right to
dissent from a plan of merger to which the corporation is a
party if shareholder approval of the merger is required by Texas
law and the shareholder was entitled to vote on the merger.
Article 5.12 of the Texas Business Corporation Act provides
a procedure under which a dissenting shareholder may receive the
fair value in cash of his or her shares, either by
agreement with the surviving corporation in the merger or as
determined in a judicial proceeding. However, dissenters
rights are not available to shareholders (a) whose
securities are listed on a national securities exchange or the
Nasdaq National Stock Market or are held of record by not less
than 2,000 holders, and (b) who are not required by the
terms of the plan of merger or plan of exchange to accept for
such shareholders shares any consideration different from
that provided to any other holder of shares of the same class,
and any consideration other than (1) shares of a
corporation that immediately after the merger or exchange will
be part of a class or series of shares which are listed on a
national securities exchange or approved for quotation as a
national market security on an interdealer quotation system, or
held of record by not less than 2,000 shareholders, and
(2) cash in lieu of fractional shares otherwise entitled to
be received. Because the Kent common stock is listed on the New
York Stock Exchange, and because holders of Kent common stock
will receive in the merger Avnet common stock, which is and
after the merger will be listed on the New York Stock Exchange,
and cash in lieu of fractional Avnet shares, holders of Kent
common stock will not have dissenters rights with respect
to the merger.

Regulatory Approvals

Business combinations such as the merger may not be consummated
until the acquiring entity and the entity to be acquired file
certain information with the United States Department of Justice
and the Federal Trade Commission (the FTC) pursuant
to the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, and
post-filing waiting period requirements have been satisfied.
Avnet and Kent filed the required information and materials with
the Department of Justice and the FTC with respect to the merger
on April 10, 2001, and the required waiting period will
expire at 11:59 p.m. on May 10, 2001, unless
terminated at an earlier date by the FTC or the Department of
Justice, or unless Avnet or Kent shall previously have received
a request from either of them for additional information.

At any time before or after the effective time of the merger,
notwithstanding the expiration of the Hart-Scott waiting period,
the Department of Justice, the FTC, any state or a private
person or entity could seek under federal or state antitrust
laws to enjoin the merger or to cause Avnet to divest itself of
all or part of Kent

or of other Avnet businesses. Based on information available to
them, management of Avnet and Kent believe that the merger can
be effected in compliance with all applicable antitrust laws.
However, there can be no assurance that a challenge to the
merger on antitrust grounds will not be made or that, if such a
challenge is made, Avnet and Kent will prevail. The obligations
of Avnet and Kent to consummate the merger are subject to the
condition that no court or other governmental entity shall have
instituted a proceeding seeking injunctive or other relief in
connection with the merger and related transactions, and that
there shall not be any judgment, decree, injunction, ruling or
order of any court or other governmental entity that prohibits,
restricts or delays consummation of the merger.

Avnet and Kent are not aware of any license or regulatory permit
which is material to the business of Kent and which is likely to
be adversely affected by the merger, or of any approval or other
action by any state, federal or foreign government or
governmental agency (other than the FTC and the Department of
Justice pursuant to the Hart-Scott Act) that would be required
prior to the merger.

Accounting Treatment

Avnet intends to account for the merger by the
pooling-of-interests method of accounting. Under this method of
accounting, the recorded assets and liabilities of Avnet and
Kent will be carried forward at their recorded amounts to Avnet
after the merger, income of Avnet after the merger will include
the income of Avnet and Kent for the entire fiscal year in which
the merger occurs, and the reported income of Avnet and Kent for
prior periods will be combined and restated as income of Avnet
after the merger. In the merger agreement, Kent represented that
it has not taken or agreed to take any action, and agreed that
it will take no action or fail to take any action, which would
prevent the merger from qualifying for pooling-of-interests
accounting treatment. See  Resales of Avnet
Shares by Affiliates of Kent below. It is not a condition
to the merger that Avnet be able to account for it as a pooling
of interests, and accounting for the merger as a purchase rather
than as a pooling of interests would not have a materially
different effect on Avnets post-merger financial condition
or results of operations.

Surrender of Kent Share Certificates

Promptly after the effective time of the merger, Avnets
appointed exchange agent will send to each record holder of Kent
common stock as of the effective time of the merger a letter of
transmittal giving notice of the merger and containing
instructions for surrendering Kent stock certificates in
exchange for Avnet stock certificates. 
You should not attempt
to forward your Kent stock certificates to us until you receive
the letter of transmittal.

From and after the effective time, each Kent stock certificate
will represent only the right to receive the number of Avnet
shares fixed by the merger exchange ratio for each Kent share
evidenced by that Kent certificate and a cash payment without
interest in lieu of any fractional Avnet share. Dividends and
other distributions payable on the Avnet shares after the
effective time of the merger and before the exchange of
certificates by any holder of Kent shares, together with any
cash payment in lieu of a fractional Avnet share, will be
remitted to such holder, without interest, only at the time that
his or her Kent stock certificates are surrendered for exchange.

Resales of Avnet Shares by Affiliates of Kent

None of the Avnet shares received by the Kent shareholders in
the merger will be subject to restrictions on resale or other
transfer by them under the Securities Act of 1933, except that
persons who are affiliates of Kent before the merger
may resell the Avnet shares they receive in the merger only
pursuant to an effective registration statement under the
Securities Act or in transactions exempt from the registration
requirements of the Securities Act by virtue of, for example,
Rule 145 under the Securities Act. An affiliate of Kent is
defined in Rule 144 under the Securities Act as a person
that directly, or indirectly through one or more intermediaries,
controls, or is controlled by, or is under common control with,
Kent.

In general, under Rule 145, an affiliate of Kent, together
with certain members of his or her immediate family, would be
entitled, for a period of one year after the effective time of
the merger, to sell Avnet shares

received in the merger only through unsolicited
brokers transactions or in transactions
directly with a market maker, as such terms are
defined in Rule 144. Additionally, (1) the number of
Avnet shares received in the merger that an affiliate of Kent
may sell within any three-month period during that one-year
period may not exceed the greater of (a) one percent of the
outstanding shares of Avnet common stock, and (b) the
average weekly trading volume of the Avnet common stock during
the four calendar weeks preceding such sale, and (2) Rule
145 would only be available for resales of Avnet shares by
affiliates of Kent at a time when Avnet has filed with the
Securities and Exchange Commission all periodic reports it is
required to have filed under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934
(Forms 10-K, 10-Q and 8-K). After one year from the effective
time, affiliates of Kent who are not affiliates of Avnet would
be able to sell freely the Avnet shares received by them in the
merger, subject only to the above-mentioned periodic reports
requirement, which would continue to apply until two years after
the effective time of the merger, at which time former
affiliates of Kent who are not then affiliates of Avnet would be
able to sell such Avnet shares without any restrictions.

Kent has agreed to identify to Avnet all persons who may be
deemed affiliates of Kent for purposes of Rule 145,
including all directors and executive officers of Kent, and has
advised such persons of the resale restrictions imposed by
applicable securities laws, including the SECs Accounting
Series Release No. 135 (ASR 135).
Under accounting principles generally accepted in the United
States, it is a general condition to the use of
pooling-of-interests accounting for a business combination that
the combination represents a sharing of rights and risks among
the shareholders of the combining entities. ASR 135 and
related interpretations of the SEC staff provide, in general,
that this risk-sharing condition will be satisfied if no
affiliate of either entity in a business combination sells
(privately or publicly), or in any way reduces his risk relative
to, any common shares received in the business combination (or
common shares of either combining company held by an affiliate
of either company) during the period beginning 30 days before
the consummation of the business combination and ending at such
time as financial results covering at least 30 days of
post-merger combined operations have been published. An
agreement entered into before the end of such post-merger period
which requires the sale of shares after such period would
preclude pooling treatment, as would any agreement to reduce the
risk borne by an affiliate shareholder after the combination.

The SEC staff has interpreted ASR 135 to permit certain
immaterial sales by affiliates. To be immaterial, (i) the
sales by an affiliate must not be greater than 10 percent
of that affiliates pre-combination (or equivalent
post-combination) shares, and (ii) the aggregate sales by
all affiliates of a combining entity must not exceed the
equivalent of one percent of that entitys pre-combination
outstanding shares.

Kent agreed in the merger agreement to deliver to Avnet
agreements from Kents directors, executive officers and
other affiliates that they will comply with the provisions of
ASR 135 and related interpretations of the SEC staff. Avnet
agreed in the merger agreement that it will use its reasonable
best efforts to publish, no later than 15 days after the
end of the first month after the effective time of the merger in
which there are at least 30 days of post-merger combined
operations, combined sales and net income data contemplated by
and in accordance with ASR 135.

THE MERGER AGREEMENT

Terms of the Merger

At the effective time of the merger, Alpha Acquisition Corp., a
wholly-owned subsidiary of Avnet, will merge into Kent, the
separate existence of Alpha will cease, and Kent will be the
surviving corporation in the merger and a wholly-owned
subsidiary of Avnet.

At the effective time of the merger,

 

	each share of Kent common stock then issued and outstanding and
	held by Kent, Avnet or Alpha will be retired automatically,

 

	each other share of Kent common stock then issued and
	outstanding will be converted into the right to receive 0.87 of
	a share of Avnet common stock,

 

	each share of Alpha then issued and outstanding will be
	converted into one share of Kent, the surviving corporation, and

 

	each share of Avnet common stock then issued and outstanding
	will remain an issued and outstanding share of Avnet common
	stock.

Fractional shares of Avnet common stock will not be issued to
Kent shareholders pursuant to the merger agreement. Instead,
holders of Kent common stock will receive an amount in cash
(without interest) equal to (1) the fraction of a share of
Avnet common stock to which the holder would otherwise be
entitled, multiplied by (2) $25.84, the average of the
closing prices of a share of Avnet common stock during the five
trading days preceding March 21, 2001, the date of the
merger agreement.

Closing; Effective Time of the Merger

The merger agreement provides that the closing of the merger
will take place on the second business day after the day on
which the last of the conditions to the merger set forth in the
merger agreement is fulfilled or waived, unless Avnet and Kent
agree to another time or date. On or as soon as practicable
after the closing date, Alpha and Kent will deliver articles of
merger to the Secretary of State of Texas. The merger will
become effective when the Secretary of State issues a
certificate of merger or such other time as is set forth in the
articles of merger.

Articles of Incorporation and By-laws of the Surviving
Corporation

The merger agreement provides that the articles of incorporation
and by-laws of Kent as in effect immediately before the
effective time of the merger will continue after the effective
time to be the articles of incorporation and by-laws of the Kent
as the surviving company in the merger, until such time, if
ever, as they may be amended in accordance with Texas law.

Directors and Officers of the Surviving Corporation

The merger agreement provides that the persons serving as
directors of Alpha immediately before the effective time of the
merger will continue as the directors of Kent as the surviving
corporation at and after the effective time of the merger, and
that before the merger Avnet will name persons who will serve as
the officers of Kent at and after the effective time of the
merger.

among others:

 

	the approval of the merger agreement by the shareholders of Kent
	and Avnet,

 

	receipt of all approvals required by any U.S. or foreign
	governmental entity, except where it is not reasonably likely
	that the failure to obtain such approval would have a material

	the absence of any pending governmental proceeding seeking

	suspending the effectiveness of the Form S-4 registration
	statement of which this proxy statement/ prospectus is a part,
	and

 

	receipt by each of Avnet and Kent of an opinion of its counsel
	stating that the merger will be treated for United States
	federal income tax purposes as a tax-free reorganization within
	the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code,
	that each of Kent, Alpha and Avnet will be a party to that
	reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(b) of the
	Code, and that Avnet, Alpha and Kent will not recognize any gain
	in the merger. See Material Federal Income Tax
	Consequences of the Merger (page 70). However, this
	condition will be satisfied with respect to Avnet or Kent if
	counsel to the other delivers the required opinion, even if its
	counsel does not deliver the opinion.

The obligations of each of Avnet and Kent to effect the merger
are also subject to the fulfillment or waiver by each of them of
the following conditions:

 

	the representations and warranties of the other in the merger
	agreement must be true and correct in all material respects both
	as of the date of the merger agreement and on the closing date
	of the merger, except where the failure to be true and correct
	would not have a material adverse effect on the other,

 

	the other must have complied in all material respects with all
	covenants requiring compliance by it prior to the closing date
	of the merger, except where the failure to comply does not
	result in a material adverse effect on the other, or prevent the
	consummation of the transactions contemplated by the merger
	agreement, and

 

	from the date of the merger agreement, no event shall have
	occurred having or likely to have a material adverse effect on
	the other.

Kents obligations to effect the merger are also subject to
the condition that the New York Stock Exchange has approved for
listing the shares of Avnet common stock distributable in the
merger and upon exercise of the Kent stock options which Avnet
is assuming. See  Covenants  Stock
Options on page 63.

Covenants

Access to Information

Kent and Avnet have agreed to give each others
representatives reasonable access during normal business hours
before the effective time of the merger to all its properties,
books, records, documents, tax returns, personnel, auditors and
counsel, and each of them will furnish promptly to the other all
information concerning itself as the other may reasonably
request, as well as all written communications it receives from
or delivers to any governmental entity in respect of the
transactions contemplated by the merger agreement.

Consents

Kent has agreed that it will use its commercially reasonable
efforts to obtain all consents from the other parties to its
material contracts, if necessary or appropriate to allow the
consummation of the merger. Both Kent and Avnet agreed to use
their commercially reasonable efforts to obtain all permits or
approvals of any governmental entity required for the lawful
consummation of the merger.

The Special Meetings

Avnet and Kent each agreed to take all action necessary in
accordance with applicable laws, its charter documents and the
policies of the New York Stock Exchange to convene and hold a
meeting of its shareholders as promptly as practicable to
consider and vote upon the merger agreement and all related
matters, in each case subject to compliance by the directors of
Kent and Avnet with their respective fiduciary duties as advised
by counsel. Each of Kent and Avnet also agreed to recommend,
through its board of directors, that its shareholders approve
the merger agreement and related matters, and to use its best
efforts to obtain such approval unless its board of directors
determines in good faith, after receiving written advice from
counsel, that such recommendation and best efforts would create
a reasonable likelihood of a breach of the fiduciary duties of
its board of directors to its shareholders under applicable law.

Conduct of Kents Business before the
Merger

Kent has agreed that before the effective time of the merger,
unless Avnet otherwise agrees, among other things it will

 

	operate its business only in the ordinary course of business
	consistent with past practices,

 

	use its reasonable efforts to preserve its existing business
	organization, insurance coverage, rights, licenses or permits,
	advantageous business relationships, agreements and credit
	facilities,

 

	retain and keep available the services of its present officers,
	employees and agents,

 

	preserve the goodwill of its customers, suppliers and others
	having business relations with it, and

 

	timely pay all taxes when due in accordance with Kents
	past practices.

Subject to compliance with applicable laws and existing
contractual obligations, Kent and its subsidiaries will not
before the effective time of the merger

 

	enter into any transaction or commitment, or dispose of or
	acquire any properties or assets, except purchases and sales of
	inventory in the ordinary course of business consistent with
	past practices,

 

	implement any new employee benefit plan or employment,
	compensatory or severance agreement,

 

	amend any existing employee benefit plan or employment
	agreement, except as required by law or the merger agreement,

 

	take any action that would be reasonably likely to jeopardize
	the continuance of any material supplier or customer
	relationship,

 

	make any change in the nature of their businesses and operations,

 

	enter into any transaction or agreement with their officers,
	director or affiliates,

 

	incur or agree to incur any obligation or liability for payment
	of more than $250,000 except transactions in the ordinary course
	of business,

 

	make any tax election or make any change in any method or period
	of accounting or any change in any accounting policy, practice
	or procedure,

 

	take or fail to take any action that would prevent, or would be
	reasonably likely to prevent, the merger from qualifying for
	pooling of interests accounting treatment, or

 

	amend their charter documents or by-laws.

Kent will not, before the effective time of the merger,

 

	declare or pay any dividend or make any other distribution in
	respect of its capital stock,

 

	split, combine or reclassify any shares of its capital stock, or
	issue, redeem or acquire any of its equity securities, options,
	warrants or convertible instruments except pursuant to existing
	contractual obligations and commitments, or

 

	grant any more options to purchase its common stock.

Conduct of Avnets Business before
the Merger

Avnet has agreed that before the effective time of the merger,
unless Kent otherwise agrees, it will

 

	operate its business only in the ordinary course of business
	consistent with past practices,

 

	use its reasonable efforts to preserve its existing business
	organization, insurance coverage, rights, licenses or permits,
	advantageous business relationships, agreements and credit
	facilities,

 

	retain and keep available the services of its present officers,
	employees and agents, and

 

	preserve the goodwill of its customers, suppliers and others
	having business relations with it.

Avnet will not, before the effective time of the merger,

 

	amend its certificate of incorporation or by-laws,

 

	declare or pay any dividend or make any other distribution in
	respect of its capital stock, other than its regular quarterly
	cash dividend consistent with past practice, or

 

	split, combine or reclassify any shares of its capital stock, or
	redeem or acquire any of its equity securities, options,
	warrants or convertible instruments except pursuant to existing
	contractual obligations or employee benefit plans.

Agreement Not to Solicit Other Acquisition Proposals

Kent has agreed that it will not, nor will it authorize or
permit any of its subsidiaries, or its or their officers,
directors, employees, consultants, investment bankers,
attorneys, accountants or other representatives or agents,
directly or indirectly, to solicit, initiate or take any other
action to facilitate knowingly any inquiries or the making of
any proposal which is or may reasonably be expected to lead to
an acquisition proposal, or engage in any discussion
or negotiations relating to an acquisition proposal, or accept
any acquisition proposal. An acquisition proposal is any
proposal or offer relating to

 

	any acquisition or purchase of all or a substantial part of the
	assets of Kent or any of its subsidiaries or more than 15% of
	any class of equity securities of Kent or any of its
	subsidiaries, or

 

	any tender offer or exchange offer that if consummated would
	result in any person or entity beneficially owning 15% or more
	of any class of equity securities of Kent or any of its
	subsidiaries, or

 

	a merger, consolidation or other business combination, a sale of
	all or substantially all the assets of Kent, or a
	recapitalization, liquidation or similar transaction involving
	Kent or any of its subsidiaries, other than the proposed
	business combination with Avnet.

However, Kent may comply with the Securities and Exchange
Commission rule with respect to a response to a tender offer.
Kent also may engage in discussions with a third party, who,
without any solicitation or encouragement by Kent, seeks to
initiate such discussions, and may furnish the third party
nonpublic information concerning Kent if the third party has
made a bona fide acquisition proposal which the board of
directors of Kent believes in good faith (after consultation
with its financial advisor) is a superior proposal,
meaning that

 

	the proposal is reasonably capable of being completed, taking
	into account all relevant, legal, financial, regulatory and
	other aspects of the proposal and the source of its financing,

 

	the proposal would, if consummated, result in a transaction more
	favorable to the shareholders of Kent, from a financial point of
	view, than the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement
	with Avnet, and

 

	the person making the proposal has, or is reasonably likely to
	have or obtain, any necessary funds or customary commitments to
	provide any funds necessary to consummate the proposal;

and Kents board of directors concludes in good faith that
entering into discussions with, and furnishing nonpublic
information to, the third party may be necessary for the board
of directors to act in a manner consistent with its fiduciary
duties under applicable law. Kent may accept a superior proposal
at any time before the closing of the merger with Avnet,
provided that Kent terminates the merger agreement.

Stock Options

Currently, there are outstanding options to purchase an
aggregate of 2,441,641 shares of Kent common stock at prices
ranging from $7.25 to $40.13 per share under its employee and
director stock option plans and agreements. At the effective
time of the merger, Avnet will assume Kents obligations
under all these options then outstanding, which will
automatically become options to purchase Avnet shares. The
exercise price per share of Avnet common stock issuable upon
exercise of each such Avnet option will be equal to the per
share exercise price of the related Kent option divided by the
exchange ratio for the conversion of Kent common stock in the
merger (0.87), and the number of shares of Avnet common stock
issuable upon exercise of each such Avnet option will be equal
to the number of shares of Kent common stock that could have
been acquired under the related Kent option multiplied by the
exchange ratio. See The Merger  Interests of
Certain Persons in the Merger and Possible Conflicts of
Interest for information about the options held by
Kents directors and executive officers.

Kent has agreed not to take any action before the merger to
accelerate the vesting of any of its outstanding employee and
director stock options.

Warrants

Currently, there are warrants to purchase an aggregate of
300,000 shares of Kent common stock at a price of $22.8125 per
share. At the effective time of the merger, each such warrant
will be converted into a right to acquire shares of Avnet common
stock. The exercise price per share of Avnet common stock
issuable upon exercise of each such warrant will be equal to
$26.22, which is the per share exercise price of the warrant
before the effective time ($22.8125) divided by the exchange
ratio for the conversion of Kent common stock in the merger
(0.87), and the number of shares of Avnet common stock issuable
upon exercise of each such warrant will be 261,000, which is the
number of shares of Kent common stock that could have been
acquired under such warrant before the effective time multiplied
by the merger exchange ratio.

Avnet Benefit Plans

When the merger is completed, the business of Kent will be
combined with the business of Avnet, and the former Kent
employees will be offered employee benefits which, in the
aggregate, are no less favorable to them than those Avnet
currently provides to its own employees. If an Avnet
employees eligibility to participate in an Avnet benefit
plan, or the vesting of benefits under a plan, is based on the
employees period of service with Avnet, a Kent employee
that becomes an Avnet employee as a result of the merger will
receive credit for his or her period of service with Kent before
the merger as if such service had been for Avnet.

Indemnification; Directors and
Officers Insurance

At all times after the effective time of the merger, Kent, as
the surviving corporation in the merger, and Avnet will
indemnify all present and former directors and officers of Kent
to the maximum extent permitted by Texas law and Kents
current articles of incorporation and by-laws, against all
losses, claims, liabilities, judgments, and amounts paid in
settlement with Avnets and Kents approval, in
connection with any actual or

threatened claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation
arising out of or pertaining to any alleged action or omission
of such directors and officers before the effective time of the
merger. Also,

 

	Kent and Avnet will pay or reimburse, to the maximum extent
	permitted by Texas law, expenses incurred by these directors and
	officers in advance of the final disposition of any such action
	or proceeding, and

 

	Avnet will maintain directors and officers liability
	insurance for six years after the effective time of the merger
	covering Kents current officers and directors on terms
	substantially no less advantageous to them than Kents
	existing insurance.

Also, see The Merger  Interests of Certain
Persons in the Merger and Possible Conflicts of
Interest  Indemnification; Directors and
Officers Insurance (page 53) and
Comparison of Avnet and Kent Shareholder
Rights  Indemnification of Directors and
Officers (page 91).

Termination

The merger agreement may be terminated at any time before the
effective time of the merger, whether before or after approval
by Kents shareholders or Avnets shareholders, by the
mutual written consent of Kent and Avnet. It may also be
terminated by either Kent or Avnet without the consent of the
other if

 

	any court or other governmental entity has issued a final,
	non-appealable order prohibiting the consummation of any of the
	transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, or

 

	the merger has not been completed by September 30, 2001,
	and the party seeking termination has not failed to perform or
	observe in any material respect any of its covenants and
	agreements in the merger agreement, or

 

	the Kent shareholders or the Avnet shareholders do not approve
	the merger agreement, or

 

	the terminating party is not in material breach of any provision
	of the merger agreement in a manner that has or is reasonably
	likely to have a material adverse effect on the terminating
	party, and the non-terminating party has materially breached any
	provision of the merger agreement in a manner which has or is
	reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on the
	non-terminating party, or which may reasonably be expected to
	prevent or materially delay the merger.

Kent may terminate the merger agreement without the consent of
Avnet

 

	if the board of directors of Avnet has withdrawn, modified or
	changed its approval or recommendation of the merger agreement
	or the merger in a manner adverse to Kent, or has resolved to do
	so, or

 

	for the purpose of entering into an agreement for a
	superior proposal. See
	Covenants  Agreement Not to Solicit Other
	Acquisition Proposals above.

Avnet may terminate the merger agreement without the consent of
Kent if

 

	the board of directors of Kent has withdrawn, modified or
	changed its approval or recommendation of the merger agreement
	or the merger in a manner adverse to Avnet, or has resolved to
	do so, or

 

	Kents board of directors has approved or recommended a
	superior proposal, or

 

	Kents board of directors has without Avnets written
	consent redeemed Kents preferred share purchase rights
	attached to the Kent common stock, or amended its shareholder
	rights plan, for any reason other than (1) to facilitate
	the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, or
	(2) following termination of the merger agreement by Kent
	for the purpose of entering into an agreement with a person that
	has made a superior proposal. See Description of Kent
	Capital Stock  Shareholder Rights Plan on
	page 80.

If the merger agreement is terminated as described above, the
merger agreement will become void, without any liability on the
part of Avnet and Kent to each other or to the shareholders of
each other; however, the termination will not relieve

 

	the obligations of Kent and Avnet to indemnify the other party
	for liabilities based on material misstatements or omissions in
	the registration statement of which this proxy
	statement/prospectus is a part, or

 

	the obligations of Kent and Avnet to keep confidential all
	non-public information disclosed by the other in connection with
	the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, or

 

	the obligation of Kent or Avnet to pay a termination fee (see
	below).

Also, if the merger agreement is terminated by either Avnet or
Kent if the terminating party is not in material breach of any
provision of the merger agreement in a manner that has or is
reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on the
terminating party, and the non-terminating party has materially
breached any provision of the merger agreement in a manner that
has or is reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on
the non-terminating party, or which may reasonably be expected
to prevent or materially delay the merger, then the terminating
party may exercise any and all rights or remedies available at
law or in equity for losses to the terminating party, and for
damages, including expenses which the terminating party incurred
in connection with the merger agreement and the transactions
contemplated in the merger agreement.

Termination Fees and Expenses

Whether or not the merger is consummated, each of Avnet and Kent
will pay its own expenses incurred in connection with the merger
agreement and the transactions contemplated by the merger
agreement.

Kent will pay Avnet $1,000,000 in cash if either Avnet or Kent
terminates the merger agreement because the Kent shareholders do
not approve the merger agreement. Kent will also pay to Avnet
$30,000,000 in cash, less any previous payment of the $1,000,000
and any amounts that Avnet recovers from Kent in litigation for
a material breach by Kent of the merger agreement, if

 

	Avnet terminates the merger agreement because the board of
	directors of Kent has withdrawn, modified or changed its
	approval or recommendation of the merger agreement or the merger
	in a manner adverse to Avnet, or has resolved to do so, or

 

	Avnet terminates the merger agreement because Kents board
	of directors has approved or recommended a superior
	proposal, or

 

	Avnet terminates the merger agreement because Kents board
	of directors has without Avnets written consent redeemed
	Kents preferred share purchase rights or amended its
	shareholder rights plan for any reason other than (1) to
	facilitate the transactions contemplated by the merger
	agreement, or (2) following termination of the merger
	agreement by Kent for the purpose of entering into an agreement
	with a person that has made a superior proposal, or

 

	Kent terminates the merger agreement for the purpose of entering
	into an agreement with a person that has made a superior
	proposal, and within one year of the termination date,
	Kent consummates a transaction or series of transactions with
	the person submitting the superior proposal, or with any
	affiliate of that person, and in the transaction more than 50%
	of Kents common stock or a majority of Kents assets
	are transferred to such person or any of its affiliates, or

 

	any person successfully acquires more than 50% of Kents
	common stock, or Kent enters into a written agreement with any
	person other than Avnet that has made or in the future makes an
	acquisition proposal, and consummates a transaction
	or series of transactions with that person or any of its
	affiliates and in the transaction more than 50% of Kents
	common stock or a majority of Kents assets

	are transferred to such person or its affiliates, if such
	transaction is consummated or the acquisition occurs within one
	year following termination of the merger agreement

(a) 

	by Kent because the merger was not completed by
	September 30, 2001, and Kent had not failed to perform or
	observe in any material respect any of its covenants and
	agreements in the merger agreement, or

(b) 

	by Kent because the Kent shareholders did not approve the merger
	agreement, or

(c) 

	by Avnet, at a time when Avnet was not in material breach of any
	provision of the merger agreement in a manner that had or was
	reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on Avnet,
	and Kent had materially breached any provision of the merger
	agreement in a manner that had or was reasonably likely to have
	a material adverse effect on Kent, or which was reasonably
	expected to prevent or materially delay the merger.

Avnet will pay Kent $1,000,000 in cash if either Avnet or Kent
terminates the merger agreement because the Avnet shareholders
do not approve the merger agreement. Avnet will also pay Kent
$30,000,000, less any previous payment of the $1,000,000 and any
amounts that Kent recovers from Avnet in litigation for a
material breach by Avnet of the merger agreement, if Kent
terminates the merger agreement because the board of directors
of Avnet has withdrawn, modified or changed its approval or
recommendation of the merger agreement or the merger in a manner
adverse to Kent, or has resolved to do so.

Amendments, Extension and Waivers

Avnet and Kent may amend the merger agreement in writing at any
time before or after the Avnet shareholders and the Kent
shareholders approve the merger agreement. However, after
approval of the merger agreement by the Kent shareholders, the
merger agreement cannot be amended in any way that would under
Texas law require further approval of the Kent shareholders or
Avnet shareholders unless such further approval is obtained.

At any time before the effective time of the merger, Kent or
Avnet may extend the time for the performance of any of the
obligations or other acts of each other, waive any inaccuracies
in the representations and warranties of each other contained in
the merger agreement or in any document delivered pursuant to
the merger agreement, or waive compliance by each other with any
of the agreements or conditions contained in the merger
agreement. Any agreement of extension or waiver must be in
writing.

OTHER AGREEMENTS

Kent Option

At the time when Avnet and Kent executed and delivered the
merger agreement, they also entered into an option agreement
under which Kent granted Avnet an option (the Kent
Option) to purchase up to 2,863,474 shares of Kent common
stock, representing about 10% of the currently issued and
outstanding Kent common stock, at an exercise price of $22.48
per share, subject to customary anti-dilution adjustments and
payable in cash or by a seven-year senior subordinated Avnet
note. The exercise price is equal to the average of the closing
prices of a share of Avnet common stock during the five trading
days immediately preceding the date of the merger agreement,
multiplied by 0.87, the exchange ratio of Kent common stock into
Avnet common stock in the merger. Avnet may exercise the Kent
Option only after

 

	any person unaffiliated with Avnet or Kent publicly announces an
	intention to acquire more than a majority of the outstanding
	shares of Kent common stock prior to the termination of the
	merger agreement, or

 

	Kent terminates the merger agreement for the purpose of entering
	into a superior proposal, or

 

	Avnet terminates the merger agreement because

(a) 

	Kents board of directors has withdrawn, modified or
	changed its approval or recommendation of the merger agreement
	or the merger in a manner adverse to Avnet, or has resolved to
	do so, or

(b) 

	Kents board of directors has approved or recommended a
	superior proposal, or

(c) 

	Kents board of directors has without Avnets written
	consent redeemed Kents preferred share purchase rights or
	amended its shareholder rights plan for any reason other than
	(1) to facilitate the transactions contemplated by the
	merger agreement, or (2) following termination of the
	merger agreement by Kent for the purpose of entering into an
	agreement with a person that has made a superior proposal, or

 

	Either

(a) 

	Kent terminates the merger agreement because (1) the merger is
	not consummated by September 30, 2001, and Kent has not
	failed to perform or observe in any material respect any of its
	covenants and agreements in the merger agreement, or
	(2) the Kent shareholders did not approve the merger
	agreement, or

(b) 

	Avnet terminates the merger agreement when it is not in material
	breach of any provision of the merger agreement in a manner that
	has or is reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on
	Avnet, because Kent has materially breached any provision of the
	merger agreement in a manner that has or is reasonably likely to
	have a material adverse effect on Kent, or which may reasonably
	be expected to prevent or materially delay the merger,

	and within one year following the termination of the merger
	agreement, any person other than Avnet successfully acquires
	more than 50% of the Kent common stock, or Kent enters into a
	written agreement with any person other than Avnet that has made
	or in the future makes an acquisition proposal, and
	consummates a transaction or series of transactions with that
	person in which more than a majority of the Kent common stock or
	a majority of the assets of Kent are transferred to that person
	or any of its affiliates.

The Kent Option will expire on the earliest to occur of

 

	the effective time of the merger,

 

	the termination of the merger agreement if the Kent Option has
	not become exercisable and cannot become exercisable,

 

	180 days after Kent Option becomes exercisable, and

 

	the date on which Avnets total recovery equals
	$40,000,000.

For a period of 30 days after a put event,
defined as the earlier of the consummation, or the execution of
an agreement providing for, a superior proposal, but
in no event later than 180 days after the Kent Option
becomes exercisable, Avnet will have the right to cancel the
Kent Option and cause Kent or its successor to pay Avnet a
cancellation price equal to the product of

 

	the number of shares as to which the Kent Option remains
	exercisable multiplied by

 

	the excess of (a) the average per share closing price of a
	share of Kent common stock for the five trading days ending on
	the trading day immediately before the occurrence of the put
	event, over (b) the $22.48 exercise price of the Kent
	Option.

Avnet has the right to cause Kent to register for resale under
the Securities Act of 1933 the shares of Kent common stock Avnet
receives upon exercise of the Kent Option. Kent has the right to
cause Avnet to register for resale under the Securities Act any
senior subordinated notes issued by Avnet in payment of amounts
due upon exercise of the Kent Option.

The Kent Option provides that in no event shall Avnets
total recovery exceed $40,000,000 and if it
otherwise would exceed such amount, Avnet must either

	(1)  reduce the number of shares issuable under the Kent
	Option, or

	(2)  deliver to Kent for cancellation shares of Kent common
	stock, or

	(3)  pay cash to Kent, or

	(4)  reduce the amount of the cancellation price of the
	Kent Option, or

	(5)  do any combination of clauses (1) through (4),

so that Avnets actually realized total recovery will not
exceed $40,000,000. The Kent Option may not be exercised for a
number of shares as would, as of the date of exercise, result in
a notional total recovery of more than $40,000,000
and, if exercise of the Kent Option would otherwise result in
the notional total recovery exceeding such amount, Avnet may
take any of the actions specified in clauses (1) through
(5) above so that the notional total recovery will not
exceed $40,000,000.

Total recovery means:

 

	the aggregate amount before taxes of

(A) 

	the excess of (x) the net cash amounts or fair market value
	of any property received by Avnet pursuant to a sale of shares
	issued under the Kent Option (or securities into which such
	shares are converted or exchanged) after payment of applicable
	brokerage or sales commissions and discounts, over (y) 
	Avnets aggregate exercise price for such option shares or
	other securities, plus

(B) 

	all amounts received by Avnet upon the cancellation of the Kent
	Option as described above, plus

(C) 

	any termination fee previously received by Avnet under the
	merger agreement,

minus

 

	all amounts of cash previously paid to Kent pursuant to clause
	(3) above, plus the value of the Kent Option shares
	previously delivered to Kent for cancellation pursuant to clause
	(2) above, which value will be the aggregate exercise price
	paid for such Kent Option shares or other securities.

Notional total recovery, with respect to any number
of shares as to which Avnet may propose to exercise the Kent
Option, is the total recovery, determined as of the date of such
proposed exercise assuming that the Kent Option was exercised on
such date for such number of shares, and assuming that such
shares,

together with all other Kent Option shares held by Avnet and its
affiliates as of such date, were sold for cash at the closing
price for the Kent common stock as of the close of business on
the preceding trading day, less customary brokerage discounts
and commissions.

Nothing in the Kent Option affects Avnets ability to
receive, or relieves Kents obligation to pay, any
termination fee provided for in the Merger Agreement; however,
if and to the extent the total recovery received by Avnet would
exceed $40,000,000 following receipt of such termination
payment, Avnet will be obligated to take the actions specified
in clauses (1) through (5) above on the date on which Avnet
has realized cash and/or property representing a total recovery
in excess of $40,000,000.

Inducement Agreements

Also at the time when Avnet and Kent executed and delivered the
merger agreement, Avnet entered into an inducement agreement
with Larry D. Olson, Stephen J. Chapko, Richard J. Hightower and
Mark A. Zerbe, and a separate inducement agreement with Morrie
K. Abramson (collectively, the Management
Shareholders). In the inducement agreements, each of the
Management Shareholders

 

	granted to Avnet an irrevocable proxy to vote all the shares of
	Kent common stock of which they are the beneficial owners with
	the power to vote (currently 592,250 shares in the aggregate),
	in favor of the approval of the merger agreement and against any
	other proposal for any recapitalization, merger, sale of assets
	or other business combination between Kent and any other person
	or entity other than Avnet or Alpha, or the taking of any action
	which would result in any of the conditions to Avnets
	obligations under the merger agreement not being fulfilled,

 

	agreed that, except as expressly permitted by the merger
	agreement, he will not directly or indirectly initiate, solicit
	or encourage any inquiries or the making or implementation of
	any alternative proposal to acquire his shares of Kent common
	stock, or engage in any negotiations concerning, or provide any
	confidential information or data to, or have any discussions
	with, any person relating to such an alternative proposal, and

 

	agreed that any additional shares of Kent common stock which he
	acquires, whether through a stock split, purchase or otherwise,
	will be subject to the terms of the inducement agreement.

The inducement agreements will expire on the earlier to occur of
the effective time of the merger or the termination of the
merger agreement in accordance with its terms.

The option agreement is attached as Appendix B to this
proxy statement/prospectus and is incorporated herein by
reference. The inducement agreements are attached as
Appendices C-1 and C-2 to this proxy statement/prospectus

MATERIAL FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSEQUENCES OF THE MERGER

The following discussion summarizes the anticipated material
federal income tax consequences of the merger. The summary is
based upon the existing provisions of Internal Revenue Code of
1986, as amended, applicable Treasury regulations promulgated or
proposed thereunder and administrative rulings by the Internal
Revenue Service and judicial authority as of the date of this
proxy statement/ prospectus. All of the foregoing is subject to
change, possibly with retroactive effect, and any change could
affect the continuing validity of the discussion. The discussion
and the opinion of Carter, Ledyard & Milburn assume that
holders of shares of Kent common stock hold such shares as
capital assets. Further, the discussion does not address the tax
consequences that may be relevant to a particular shareholder
subject to special treatment under certain federal income tax
laws, such as dealers in securities, traders in securities that
elect to use a mark-to-market method of accounting, tax-exempt
organizations, foreign persons, persons that hold Kent common
stock as part of a straddle, constructive
sale, or conversion transaction and persons
who acquired shares of Avnet common stock or Kent common stock
through the exercise of employee stock options or rights or
otherwise as compensation or through a tax-qualified retirement
plan. This discussion does not address any consequences arising
under the laws of any state, locality or foreign jurisdiction.
No ruling has been or will be sought from the Internal Revenue
Service as to the anticipated tax consequences of the merger.

Tax Opinions. 
It is a condition to the obligation of each
of Avnet and Kent to complete the merger that it receive an
opinion of its counsel that the merger will be treated for
federal income tax purposes as a reorganization within the
meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code, that Avnet, Alpha
and Kent will each be a party to that reorganization within the
meaning of Section 368(b) of the Code, and that Avnet,
Alpha and Kent will not recognize any gain in the merger.
However, these opinions will not be binding on the Internal
Revenue Service, and there can be no assurance that the IRS will
agree with the conclusions expressed in the opinions. The
opinions are and will be based in part upon certain assumptions
and certain representations made by Kent and Avnet customarily
made and given in transactions of this type.

Tax Consequences of the Merger. 
In the opinion of Carter,
Ledyard & Milburn, assuming that the assumptions and
representations described in the preceding paragraph are true
and complete as of the effective time, the merger will be
treated as a reorganization within the meaning of
Section 368(a) of the Code, and each of Avnet, Kent and
Alpha will be a party to that reorganization within the meaning
of 368(b) of the Code. As a result, subject to the paragraph
below, in general,

 

	Avnet, Alpha and Kent will not recognize any gain as a result of
	the merger,

 

	a holder of Kent common stock will not recognize any gain or
	loss as a result of the conversion of shares of Kent common
	stock into shares of Avnet common stock pursuant to the merger

 

	the aggregate tax basis of the shares of Avnet common stock
	received in the merger will be the same as the aggregate tax
	basis of the shares of Kent common stock converted, and

 

	the holding period of the shares of Avnet common stock received
	in the merger will include the holding period of shares of Kent
	common stock converted.

Cash Received in Lieu of Fractional Shares.
 If a holder
of shares of Kent common stock receives cash in lieu of a
fractional share of Avnet common stock, this fractional share
interest will be treated as having been distributed to the
holder, and the cash amount will be treated as received in
redemption of the fractional share interest. In general, the
holder will recognize capital gain or loss equal to the cash
amount received for the fractional share reduced by the portion
of the holders tax basis in shares of Kent common stock
surrendered that is allocable to the fractional share interest
in Avnet common stock. The capital gain or loss will be
long-term capital gain or loss if the holders holding
period in the Kent common stock allocable to the fractional
share interest for federal income tax purposes is more than one
year.

The preceding summary is not a complete analysis or
discussion of all potential tax effects relevant to the merger.
Kent shareholders are urged to consult their own tax advisers as
to the specific tax consequences to them of the merger,
including tax return reporting requirements, the applicability
and effect of federal, state, local, foreign and other
applicable tax laws and the effect of any proposed changes in
the tax laws.

PRO FORMA FINANCIAL DATA

The following unaudited pro forma combined condensed statements
of income combine Avnets results for its fiscal years
ended June 30, 2000, July 2, 1999 and June 26,
1998 with Kents results for its fiscal years ended
April 1, 2000, April 3, 1999 and March 28, 1998,
giving effect to the merger as if it had occurred on the first
day of Avnets fiscal year. As such, Kents period
from April 2, 2000 to June 30, 2000 has been omitted
from the pro forma condensed combined statements of income.
Kents sales, gross profit, income before income taxes and
net income for that period, excluding discontinued operations,
were approximately $223,313,000, $46,244,000, $9,863,000 and
$5,918,000, respectively. In addition, the unaudited interim pro
forma condensed combined statements of income combine
Avnets results for its first halves ended
December 29, 2000 and December 31, 1999 with
Kents results for its first halves ended
September 30, 2000 and October 2, 1999, giving effect
to the merger as if it occurred on the first day of Avnets
fiscal periods. The unaudited pro forma condensed combined
balance sheet combines the balance sheets of Avnet as of
December 29, 2000 and Kent as of December 30, 2000,
giving effect to the merger as if it had occurred on
December 29, 2000.

The pro forma adjustments reflect the application of
pooling-of-interests accounting as discussed below.
The unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information
and the accompanying notes should be read together with
Avnets and Kents historical financial statements and
related notes contained in the annual reports and other
information that Avnet and Kent have filed with the SEC and
incorporated by reference. See Where You Can Find More
Information on page 94.

The unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information
is provided for informational purposes only and does not purport
to represent what the combined financial position and results of
operations would actually have been had the merger and other pro
forma adjustments in fact occurred on the dates indicated. The
unaudited pro forma condensed combined statements of income do
not include the impact of nonrecurring charges or credits
directly attributable to the transaction. The unaudited pro
forma condensed combined statements of income exclude any
benefits that might result from the merger due to synergies that
may be derived from the elimination of any duplicate costs and
other productivity gains. In addition, the unaudited pro forma
condensed combined financial statements do not reflect costs to
be incurred for integration-related expenses necessary to reduce
costs and increase operational efficiency. The unaudited pro
forma condensed combined financial statements do not purport to
be indicative of the results that actually would have occurred
if the merger had occurred on the dates indicated, or of results
which may be obtained in the future. There have been no material
transactions between Avnet and Kent requiring adjustment in the
unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information.

For financial accounting purposes, it is expected that the
merger will be accounted for using the pooling-of-interests
method of accounting. Accordingly, (1) the historical cost
basis of the assets and liabilities of Avnet and Kent will be
carried forward to the combined company, (2) the results of
operations of the combined company will include the income of
Avnet and Kent for the entire fiscal period in which the
combination occurs and (3) the historical results of
operations of the separate companies for fiscal years before the
merger will be combined and reported as the results of
operations of the combined company. No adjustments have been
made to the historical financial statements of Avnet and Kent to
conform the accounting policies of the combining companies as
the nature and amounts of such adjustments are not expected to
be significant. Upon consummation of the merger, further review
of Kents accounting policies and financial statements may
require restatements of the combined entitys financial
statements to conform to those policies and classifications that
are deemed most appropriate.

Some of the conditions to be met to qualify for
pooling-of-interests accounting cannot be fully assessed until
specified periods of time after the effective time of the merger
have passed because certain of the conditions for
pooling-of-interests accounting treatment address transactions
occurring within those specified periods of time. Certain
events, including divestitures and certain stock transactions,
could disqualify the merger from pooling-of-interests accounting.

Notes to Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Combined Financial
Information

1.  Avnet and Kent estimate that they will incur direct
transaction costs of approximately $12 million associated with
the merger. These costs consist primarily of fees and expenses
of investment bankers, attorneys and accountants, SEC filing
fees, stock exchange listing fees, and financial printing and
other related charges. These expenses have not been reflected in
the unaudited pro forma condensed combined statements of income
as they are considered to be nonrecurring.

2.  Adjustments reflect the cancellation of Kent treasury
shares and the issuance of Avnet common stock to effect the
merger. This amount has been calculated by multiplying the
number of shares of Kent common stock outstanding at
December 29, 2000 (approximately 28,600,000 shares) by the
exchange ratio of 0.87. The number of shares of Avnet common
stock to be issued upon completion of the merger will be based
on the actual number of shares of Kent common stock outstanding
at that time.

3.  The pro forma combined per share amounts and weighted
average common shares reflect the combined weighted average of
Avnet common stock and Kent common stock for all periods
presented, after adjusting the number of shares of Kent common
stock to reflect the exchange ratio of 0.87 of a share of Avnet
common stock for each share of Kent common stock. Additionally,
as discussed on page 53, in 1997, Kent issued $207,000,000
of 4.5% Convertible Subordinated Notes due 2004 (the
Notes). The Notes were anti-dilutive in Kents
historical earnings per share calculations; however, on a pro
forma basis, the Notes are dilutive for certain periods. The pro
forma adjustments to the number of shares used to compute
diluted earnings per share from continuing operations for the
year ended July 2, 1999 and the first half ended
December 29, 2000 reflect the conversion of the Notes into
Avnet common stock as of the beginning of the period presented.

4.  Avnet expects to incur costs subsequent to the merger
to integrate the two companies. These costs will be charged to
operations subsequent to the merger and, therefore, are not
reflected in the unaudited pro forma condensed combined
financial information.

5.  The Avnet historical data used in preparing the
accompanying unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial
information includes the special charges discussed in more
detail in notes 3, 4, 5 and 6 to the selected historical
financial information of Avnet on page 12.

Avnet is authorized to issue 300,000,000 shares of common stock,
par value $1.00 per share. At the close of business on
March 31, 2001, it had outstanding 92,427,557 shares of
common stock and 9,331 treasury shares. All outstanding shares
of common stock are fully paid and nonassessable.

The holders of shares of Avnets common stock have equal
rights to dividends from funds legally available for the payment
of dividends when, as and if declared by Avnets board of
directors, and are entitled, upon liquidation, to share ratably
in any distribution in which holders of common stock
participate. The common stock is not redeemable, has no
preemptive or conversion rights and is not liable for
assessments or further calls. The holders of shares of
Avnets common stock are entitled to one vote for each
share at all meetings of shareholders.

The transfer agent and registrar for Avnets common stock
is Wells Fargo Minnesota, N.A. Avnets common stock is
listed on the New York Stock Exchange and the Pacific Exchange.

Under its certificate of incorporation, Avnet is authorized to
issue up to 3,000,000 shares of preferred stock, in series. For
each series of preferred stock, Avnets board of directors
may fix the relative rights, preferences and limitations as
between the shares of such series, the shares of other series of
Avnet preferred stock, and the shares of Avnet common stock. No
shares of Avnet preferred stock are outstanding.

DESCRIPTION OF KENT CAPITAL STOCK

Kent Common Stock

Kent is authorized to issue 60,000,000 shares of Kent common
stock. Holders of Kent common stock are entitled to one vote per
share on all matters on which they are entitled to vote. Because
holders of Kent common stock do not have cumulative voting
rights, directors are elected by a plurality vote of shares
present at a meeting of shareholders, meaning that the nominees
who receive the greatest number of votes properly cast, even if
less than a majority, will be elected. Except as required by
Texas law for certain extraordinary transactions and as set
forth below under Charter and By-law Provisions, a
majority of the votes cast is sufficient for other actions that
require the vote or concurrence of shareholders. The Kent common
stock is not redeemable and has no conversion or preemptive
rights. All of the outstanding shares of Kent common stock are
fully-paid and nonassessable.

In the event of the liquidation or dissolution of Kent, subject
to the rights of the holders of any outstanding shares of Kent
preferred stock, the holders of Kent common stock are entitled
to share pro rata in any balance of the corporate assets
available for distribution to them.

Kent may pay dividends when and as declared by its board of
directors from funds legally available therefor.

Kent Preferred Stock

Kent is authorized to issue up to 2,000,000 shares of Kent
preferred stock, par value $1.00 per share. No shares of Kent
preferred stock are currently outstanding. The Kent board is
authorized to divide the Kent preferred stock into series and,
with respect to each series, to determine the dividend rights,
dividend rate, conversion rights, voting rights, redemption
rights and terms, liquidation preferences, sinking fund
provisions, the number of shares constituting the series and the
designation of such series. The Kent board could, without
shareholder approval, issue Kent preferred stock with voting
rights and other rights that could adversely affect the voting
power of holders of Kent common stock and could be used to
prevent a hostile takeover of Kent. The Kent board has set the
terms and conditions of a series of Kent preferred stock
consisting of 200,000 shares designated as Kent series A
preferred stock in connection with the adoption of a shareholder
rights plan. See  Shareholder Rights Plan
below. Except in connection with the possible triggering of such
plan, Kent has no present plans to issue any shares of Kent
preferred stock.

Charter and By-law Provisions

The Kent articles of incorporation have a fair price
provision relating to certain business combinations, including
certain mergers, consolidations, asset and stock conveyances,
liquidations and reclassifications. A business combination
includes

 

	a merger or consolidation of Kent or any subsidiary with an
	interested shareholder,

 

	a sale, lease, transfer, exchange, mortgage, pledge, or other
	disposition of all or any substantial part of the consolidated
	assets of Kent and its subsidiaries to any interested
	shareholder,

 

	the adoption of a plan or proposal for the liquidation or
	dissolution of Kent proposed by or on behalf of an interested
	shareholder,

 

	the issuance, pledge or transfer by Kent or any subsidiary of
	any securities of Kent or a subsidiary to an interested
	shareholder, and

 

	any reclassification of securities, recapitalization, merger
	with a subsidiary or other transaction which has the effect of
	increasing an interested shareholders proportionate share
	of the outstanding equity securities of Kent.

Interested shareholder means any person, and any affiliate or
associate of that person, which

 

	is the beneficial owner, as of the date of determination or
	immediately prior to the consummation of a business combination,
	of 10% or more of the voting stock of Kent,

 

	was, at any time within two years preceding the date of
	determination or the consummation of a business combination, the
	beneficial owner of 10% or more of the voting stock of Kent, or

 

	is an assignee of shares of voting stock of Kent which were at
	any time within two years preceding the date of determination or
	the consummation of a business combination beneficially owned by
	an interested shareholder, if such assignment did not involve a
	public offering.

The fair price provision provides that, except in
certain circumstances, any business combination between Kent and
an interested shareholder must be approved by the affirmative
vote of the holders of 80% of all shares of Kent entitled to
vote in elections of directors, unless certain pricing and
procedural requirements regarding the business combination are
satisfied. For instance, one such requirement is that the
aggregate consideration to be paid for each share of Kent common
stock must be at least equal to the highest per share price paid
by the interested shareholder to acquire any share of Kent
common stock during a specified period. Additionally, the higher
voting requirements do not apply to transactions approved by a
majority of the continuing directors. Generally, a
director is deemed to be a continuing director if he was a
director on May 15, 1987, or was appointed by a majority of
other continuing directors or elected by the shareholders after
having been recommended to the shareholders by a majority of
other continuing directors. The fair price provision
could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire
control of Kent.

The Kent board of directors is classified into three classes of
directors who serve staggered three-year terms. Newly created
directorships or vacancies on the board may only be filled by a
majority vote of directors then in office, even if less than a
quorum, and directors may be removed during their term only for
cause and only by the affirmative vote of two-thirds of all
shares of voting stock. The Kent by-laws also require that the
provisions described above may not be further amended, altered,
changed or repealed, nor may the number of directors be
increased, without either the affirmative vote of the holders of
not less than 80% of all shares of capital stock of Kent
entitled to vote at a meeting of shareholders, or the approval
of a majority of directors in office.

Shareholder Rights Plan

On October 21, 1999, the board of directors of Kent created
one preferred share purchase right for each outstanding share of
Kent common stock and issued such rights to Kents
shareholders of record at the close of business on
November 5, 1999. Each right entitles the registered holder
to purchase from the company one

one-hundredth of a share of series A preferred stock, par value
$1.00 per share, at a price of $100 per one one-hundredth of a
share, subject to adjustment. The description and terms of the
rights are fully set forth in a rights agreement between Kent
and ChaseMellon Shareholder Services L.L.C., as rights agent.

Until the distribution date, (a) the rights are
not exercisable, will be evidenced by the Kent common stock
certificates and will be transferable with and only with those
certificates, (b) Kent common stock certificates issued
after November 5, 1999 contain a legend incorporating the
rights agreement by reference, and (c) the surrender for
transfer of any certificates for Kent common stock outstanding
will also constitute the transfer of the rights associated with
the Kent common stock represented by such certificate.

The rights will separate from the Kent common stock and a
distribution date will occur upon the earlier of
(i) a public announcement that a person or group of
affiliated or associated persons has become an acquiring
person by acquiring or obtaining the right to acquire
beneficial ownership of 15% or more of the outstanding shares of
Kent common stock (the date of the announcement being the
Stock Acquisition Date), or (ii) ten business
days (or such later date as may be determined by Kents
board of directors before the distribution date occurs)
following the commencement of a tender offer or exchange offer
that would result in a persons becoming an acquiring
person.

As soon as practicable after the distribution date, rights
certificates will be mailed to holders of record of Kent common
stock as of the close of business on the distribution date and
thereafter the separate rights certificates alone will represent
the rights. All shares of Kent common stock issued before the
distribution date will be issued with rights.

The rights will expire at the close of business on
November 5, 2009, unless earlier redeemed by Kent as
described below.

If a person becomes an acquiring person (except pursuant to a
tender or exchange offer for all outstanding shares of Kent
common stock at a price and on terms that the Kent board of
directors determines to be fair to and otherwise in the best
interests of Kent and its shareholders (a Permitted
Offer)), (a) each holder of a right will thereafter
have the right to receive, upon exercise, shares of Kent common
stock (or, in certain circumstances, cash, property or other
securities of Kent) having a current market price equal to two
times the exercise price of the right, and (b) all rights
that are, or in certain circumstances were, beneficially owned
by or transferred to any acquiring person (or certain related
parties) will be null and void. However, the rights will not be
exercisable in these circumstances until the rights are no
longer redeemable by Kent as described below.

For example, if a person becomes an acquiring person and the
exercise price of a right remains at $100, each right not owned
by an acquiring person or by certain related persons would
entitle its holder to purchase $200 worth of Kent common stock
(or other consideration, as noted above) based upon its then
current market price, for $100. Assuming that the Kent common
stock had a current market price of $20 per share at such time,
the holder of each valid right would be entitled to purchase 10
shares of Kent common stock for $100.

If at any time from and after the time a person becomes an
acquiring person, (i) Kent is acquired in a merger or other
business combination transaction (other than certain mergers
that follow a Permitted Offer), or (ii) 50% or more of
Kents assets or earning power is sold or transferred, each
holder of a right (except rights that previously have been
voided as set forth above) shall thereafter have the right to
receive, upon exercise, a number of shares of common stock of
the acquiring company having a current market price equal to two
times the exercise price of the right.

For example, at the current exercise price of $100 per right,
each right following a business combination or asset sale or
transfer would entitle its holder to purchase $200 worth of
common stock of the acquiring company for $100. Assuming that
the common stock of the acquiring company had a per share value
of $50 at such time, the holder of each issued right would be
entitled to purchase four shares of the common stock of the
acquiring company for $100.

The Purchase Price payable, and the number of one one-hundredths
of a share of series A preferred stock or other securities or
property issuable, upon exercise of the rights are subject to
adjustment to prevent dilution (i) in the event of a stock
dividend on, or a subdivision, combination or reclassification
of, the series A preferred stock, (ii) if holders of the
series A preferred stock are granted certain rights or warrants
to subscribe for series A preferred stock or convertible
securities at less than the current market price of the
series A preferred stock, or (iii) upon the
distribution to holders of the series A preferred stock of
evidences of indebtedness or assets (excluding regular quarterly
cash dividends) or of subscription rights or warrants (other
than those referred to above).

Kent may redeem all but not some of the rights at a price of
$.001 per right payable, at the option of Kent, in cash, shares
of Kent common stock or such other consideration as the Kent
board of directors may determine at any time prior to the
earlier of (1) the close of business on the tenth business
day after a person becomes an acquiring person, and (2) the
expiration date of the rights. When the rights are redeemed,
they will immediately terminate and will evidence only the right
to receive the $.001 redemption price.

At any time after a person becomes an acquiring person and prior
to a persons becoming the beneficial owner of 50% or more
of the shares of Kent common stock then outstanding, Kent may
exchange some or all of the rights (other than rights owned by
an acquiring person or an affiliate or an associate of an
acquiring person, which will have become null and void) at an
exchange ratio of one share of Kent common stock, and/or other
equity securities deemed to have the same value as one share of
Kent common stock, per right, subject to adjustment.

Other than certain provisions relating to the principal economic
terms of the rights, any of the provisions of the rights
agreement may be amended by the board of directors of Kent
before the distribution date. After the distribution date, the
provisions of the rights agreement may be amended by the board
only in order to cure any ambiguity, defect or inconsistency, or
to make changes which do not materially adversely affect the
interests of holders of rights (excluding the interests of any
acquiring person); however, no amendment to adjust the time
period governing redemption may be made at any time when the
rights have ceased to be redeemable.

Although the rights are not intended to prevent a takeover of
Kent at a full and fair price, they have certain anti-takeover
effects. They are designed to deter an attempt to acquire Kent
in a manner which seeks to deprive Kents shareholders of
the full and fair value of their investment and may deter
attempts by significant shareholders to take advantage of Kent
and its shareholders through certain self-dealing transactions.
The rights may cause substantial dilution to a person or group
that acquires or attempts to acquire Kent without the rights
being redeemed. Therefore, the rights should encourage any
potential acquiror to seek to negotiate with the Kent board of
directors. Unless the approval is first obtained from the Kent
board or, in limited circumstances, the shareholders of Kent,
the rights may deter transactions, including tender offers,
which the majority of Kent shareholders may believe are
beneficial to them.

Kent has agreed to take all necessary action so that the
consummation of the merger and other transactions contemplated
thereby will not result in a distribution data for the rights
under the rights agreement.

COMPARISON OF AVNET AND KENT SHAREHOLDER RIGHTS

In connection with the merger, Kent shareholders will receive
common stock of Avnet. Kent is a Texas corporation, and Avnet is
a New York corporation. The laws of Texas and the Kent articles
of incorporation and by-laws differ in significant ways from the
laws of New York and the certificate of incorporation and
by-laws of Avnet. Because of these differences, the rights of
holders of Kent common stock will change when they receive Avnet
common stock in the merger.

Copies of the Kent articles of incorporation and by-laws and the
Avnet certificate of incorporation and by-laws are available
upon request. See Where You Can Find More
Information on page 94.

Below is a summary of some of the material differences between
Texas and New York law and between the articles of incorporation
and by-laws of Kent and the certificate of incorporation and
by-laws of Avnet. It is not practicable to summarize all
differences in this proxy statement/prospectus, but some of the
principal differences which could materially affect the rights
of Kent stockholders include the following:

Voting on Business Combinations

Generally, under Texas law, the vote of shareholders required
for approval of a plan of merger or exchange is the affirmative
vote of the holders of at least two-thirds of the outstanding
shares entitled to vote thereon of each constituent Texas
corporation.

Under New York law, a plan of merger, consolidation or share
exchange must be approved (a) by two-thirds of the votes of
all outstanding shares entitled to vote on the transaction, in
the case of New York corporations that were in existence on
February 22, 1998, such as Avnet, and that do not expressly
provide in their certificates of incorporation for majority
approval of such transactions, and (b) by a majority of the
votes of all outstanding shares entitled to vote on the
transaction, in the case of all other New York corporations. The
Avnet certificate of incorporation does expressly provide for
majority approval of such transactions. New York law also
provides that the holders of shares of a class, or series of a
class, of capital stock of a corporation shall be entitled to
vote together and to vote as a separate class on any merger or
consolidation in which (a) such shares will remain
outstanding after the merger or consolidation or will be
converted into the right to receive shares of stock of the
surviving or consolidated corporation or another corporation and
(b) the charter of the surviving or consolidated
corporation or such other corporation immediately after the
effectiveness of the merger or consolidation would contain any
provision that is not contained in the charter of the pre-merger
corporation and that, if contained in an amendment thereto,
would entitle the holders of shares of such class or series of a
class to vote as a separate class pursuant to the procedures
under New York law for class voting on charter amendments
discussed under  Amendments to Charters.

Approval of the Kent merger by Avnets shareholders is not
required by New York law since Alpha, not Avnet itself, is a
constituent corporation in the proposed merger. Avnet
shareholder approval of the merger is required by the policies
of the New York Stock Exchange because the number of the shares
of Avnet common stock issuable in the merger will be greater
than 20 percent of the number of shares of Avnet common
stock outstanding before the merger.

Though not applicable to the merger of Kent with Alpha
Acquisition Corp., under Texas law, no vote of the shareholders
of the sole surviving corporation in a merger is required (and
no dissenters rights are available to such shareholders)
if (1) the articles of incorporation of the surviving
corporation will not differ from its articles of incorporation
before the merger, (2) each shareholder of the corporation
whose shares were outstanding immediately before the effective
date of the merger will hold the same number of shares, with
identical designations, preferences, limitations and relative
rights, immediately after the effective date of the merger,
(3) the voting power of the number of voting shares
outstanding immediately after the merger, plus the voting power
of the number of voting shares issuable in the merger does not
exceed by more than 20% the voting power of the total number of
voting shares outstanding immediately prior to the merger,
(4) the number of participating shares outstanding
immediately after the merger, plus the number of participating
shares issuable in the merger, will not exceed by more than 20%
the total number of participating shares outstanding immediately
before the merger, and (5) the board of directors of the
corporation adopts a resolution approving the plan of merger.
New York law has no comparable provision.

Anti-takeover Provisions

Business Combination Statutes

The Texas Business Combination Law in general prohibits a
business combination between an issuing public corporation and
an affiliated shareholder, or any affiliate or associate of the
affiliated shareholder for three years after the time the
shareholder became an affiliated shareholder, unless

 

	before that time, the board of directors of the corporation
	approved either the business combination or the transaction that
	resulted in the shareholder becoming an affiliated shareholder,
	or

 

	at least six months after the time that the shareholder became
	an affiliated shareholder, the business combination is approved
	by the affirmative vote at a shareholders meeting of at
	least two-thirds of the outstanding voting shares that are not
	owned by the affiliated shareholder or an affiliate or associate
	of the affiliated shareholder.

The term business combination includes any merger,
share exchange or conversion of an issuing public corporation or
a subsidiary, with or caused by, an affiliated shareholder, and
the sale, lease, exchange, mortgage, pledge, transfer or other
disposition of assets of the corporation or any subsidiary
having an aggregate market value equal to or greater than 10% of
either the aggregate market value of all the assets of the
corporation on a consolidated basis or the aggregate market
value of all the outstanding common stock of the corporation, or
representing 10% or more of the earning power or net income,
determined on a consolidated basis, of the issuing public
corporation; the issuance or transfer by the issuing public
corporation or a subsidiary to an affiliated shareholder or its
affiliate or associate of shares of the corporation or a
subsidiary (other than as a result of the exercise of warrants
or rights to purchase shares of the corporation offered, or a
pro rata share dividend); the adoption of a plan or proposal for
the liquidation or dissolution of an issuing public corporation
proposed by, or pursuant to any agreement, arrangement or
understanding with an affiliated shareholder or its affiliate or
associate; transactions that would increase the affiliated
shareholders proportionate ownership percentage of the
outstanding shares of voting shares or securities convertible
into voting shares of the corporation; and any receipt by the
affiliated shareholder or its affiliate or associate of the
benefit of any loans, advances, guarantees, pledges or other
financial assistance or tax advantage provided by or through the
corporation.

In general, an affiliated shareholder is any person
who is the beneficial owner of 20% or more of the outstanding
voting shares of the issuing public corporation, or that, within
the preceding three-year period, was the beneficial owner of 20%
or more of the then outstanding voting shares of the issuing
public corporation. The term beneficial owner is
broadly defined to include any person that individually, or with
or through such persons affiliates or associates, among
other things, beneficially owns such stock, or has the right to
acquire such stock (whether such right is exercisable
immediately or only after the passage of time) pursuant to an
agreement, arrangement or understanding or upon the exercise of
warrants, or options, or otherwise, or has the right to vote
such stock pursuant to any agreement, arrangement or
understanding, or has an agreement, arrangement or understanding
to acquire, hold, dispose or vote such stock with another person
who beneficially owns, or whose affiliate or associate
beneficially owns the stock.

The term issuing public corporation means a domestic
corporation that has 100 or more shareholders, any class or
series of its voting shares registered under the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934, or any class or series of its voting
shares qualified for trading in a national market system.

The restrictions of the Texas Business Combination Law do not
apply to a business combination of a corporation that has
expressly elected in its articles of incorporation or by-laws or
an amendment thereto not to be subject to it. The restrictions
also do not apply to a business combination with a shareholder
that has inadvertently become an affiliated shareholder and has
divested itself of a sufficient number of voting shares as soon
as practicable and would not at any time within the 3-year
period preceding the announcement date of the business
combination have been an affiliated shareholder but for the
inadvertent acquisition.

Because the Kent articles of incorporation do not opt out of the
Texas Business Combination Law, it is applicable to the merger;
however, the Kent board of directors unanimously approved the
merger and the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement
before Avnet became an interested shareholder.

Also, the Kent articles of incorporation provide in general that
the affirmative vote of the holders of 80% of all shares of
stock of the corporation entitled to vote in elections of
directors is required for the adoption or authorization of a
business combination with or involving any
interested shareholder. See Description of
Kent Capital Stock  Charter and By-Law
Provisions on page 80. Avnets certificate of
incorporation contains no comparable provision.

The business combination provisions of New York law are similar
to the above provisions of the Texas Business Combination Law,
except that (i) an interested shareholder under
New York law is the direct or

indirect beneficial owner of at least 20% (not 10%) of the
corporations voting stock, and (ii) the corporation
may not engage in a business combination (the definition of
which is similar to that under the Texas Business Combination
Law) with an interested shareholder for a period of five (rather
than three) years, unless the business combination or the
purchase of stock by means of which the interested shareholder
became such is approved by the corporations board of
directors in advance of such stock purchase, or unless the
interested shareholder was the beneficial owner of 5% or more of
the corporations outstanding voting stock on
October 30, 1985, and remains so until becoming an
interested shareholder.

After the five-year restricted period, an interested shareholder
of a New York corporation may engage in a business combination
with the corporation if the business combination is approved by
the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the shares
of the corporations voting stock other than those
beneficially owned by the interested shareholder and his
affiliates and associates, or if the value of the aggregate
consideration to be paid by the interested shareholder in
connection with the business combination satisfies certain
fair price formulas specified in the statute, and
the interested shareholder, after becoming such, has not
acquired any additional shares of voting of the corporation,
except as provided in the statute.

The New York business combination statute provides only limited
regulation of certain self-dealing transactions between a
corporation and certain large shareholders. Moreover, wholly
apart from the exceptions mentioned above, there are a number of
additional methods whereby even an interested shareholder can
benefit from a merger or sale of a corporations assets
during the first five years after becoming an interested
shareholder. For example, under New York law, a shareholder,
prior to becoming an interested shareholder, may solicit proxies
or shareholder consents to change the composition of the board
of directors, and the new board which the shareholder has
elected or helped to elect may approve a business combination
with the stockholder without the statutory delay. Also, an
interested shareholder may simply acquire control of the
corporation, remove the incumbent board and thereafter sell
assets to third parties.

Note that the Texas and New York laws

 

	do not prohibit tender offers or in any way regulate when, how,
	at what price or by whom they may be made,

 

	do not in any way delay the purchase of shares in tender offers,

 

	do not interfere with the right of a shareholder, whether
	interested or not, to mount a proxy contest to
	remove incumbent management,

 

	do not prevent a shareholder from buying sufficient stock to
	replace existing management immediately, and

 

	unlike certain other anti-takeover statutes (e.g.
	Indianas), do not eliminate or delay a shareholders
	right to vote on the election of directors or on any other
	corporate matters except certain defined self-dealing
	transactions.

Shareholder Rights Plan

Kent has in place a shareholder rights plan under which there is
one right associated with each share of outstanding Kent common
stock, and each right currently entitles the registered holder,
after the distribution date, to purchase from Kent
one one-hundredth of a share of series A preferred stock at a
price of $100 (subject to adjustment). As discussed above, the
rights have anti-takeover effects. See Description of Kent
Capital Stock  Shareholder Rights Plan on
page 80.

Avnet has no similar rights plan.

Greenmail Statute

In addition to a business combination statute, New York law, but
not Texas law, includes a greenmail type of
anti-takeover provision, designed to prevent a corporation from
buying at a premium price a corporate raiders interest in
the corporation. In general, no publicly held New York
corporation may purchase or agree

to purchase more than 10% of its stock from a shareholder for
more than the market value thereof (as defined) unless purchase
or agreement to purchase is approved by the affirmative vote of
the board of directors followed by the affirmative vote of the
holders of a majority of the votes of all outstanding shares
entitled to vote thereon, or such greater percentage as the
corporations certificate of incorporation may require.
This does not apply when the corporation offers to purchase
shares from all holders of its stock, or with respect to stock
which the holder has owned beneficially for more than two years.

Supermajority Voting

Under Texas law, an amendment to a corporations by-laws
normally requires the affirmative vote of the holders of a
majority of the shares that are entitled to vote on the
amendment, and that voted for or against or expressly abstained
with respect to the amendment, unless the corporations
articles of incorporation or by-laws provide for a different
vote. Kents by-laws provide that the affirmative vote of
the holders of not less than 80% of all shares of Kent stock
entitled to vote at a meeting of shareholders, or the
affirmative vote of a majority of the directors in office, will
be required to amend or repeal any of the provisions of
Kents by-laws relating to

 

	the procedures for determining the business which may be
	conducted at an annual meeting of Kent shareholders,

 

	the classification of the Kent board of directors into three
	classes with staggered three-year terms,

 

	the removal of directors of Kent only for cause and only by a
	two-thirds vote of Kents shareholders,

 

	the filling of vacancies on the board of directors, including
	newly-created directorships, only by majority vote of the
	directors then in office,

 

	the procedure for Kent shareholders to nominate persons for
	election to the Kent board of directors,

 

	any increase in the number of Kent directors, and

 

	restrictions on amendments to the by-laws.

These provisions may have the effect of discouraging hostile or
unsolicited takeover attempts or proxy contests or,
alternatively, may encourage persons considering such actions to
negotiate with the existing Kent board.

Avnets certificate of incorporation and by-laws contain no
supermajority shareholder voting provisions.

Dissenters Appraisal Rights

Texas law generally entitles a shareholder to exercise its
dissenters rights upon a plan of merger (except for the
limited classes of mergers for which no shareholder approval is
required, and as set forth hereunder), the sale, lease, exchange
or other disposition of all, or substantially all, the property
and assets of the corporation if special authorization of the
shareholders is required and the shareholders hold shares
entitled to vote thereon, or a plan of exchange in which the
shares of the corporation held by the shareholders are to be
acquired, in accordance with certain procedural requirements.
Texas law, however, does not provide dissenters rights for
shareholders with respect to any plan of merger in which there
is a single surviving or new domestic or foreign corporation, or
from any plan of exchange if (a) the shares held by the
shareholder are part of a class, the shares of which are listed
on a national securities exchange or quoted on the Nasdaq
National Stock Market or held of record by not less than 2,000
shareholders and (b) the shareholder is not required by the
terms of the plan of merger or plan of exchange to accept for
such shareholders shares any consideration different than
that provided to any other holder of the shares of the same
class, and any consideration other than (1) shares of a
corporation that, immediately after the merger or exchange, will
be part of a class or series of shares which are listed, or
authorized for listing, on a national securities exchange, or
approved for quotation as a national market security on an
interdealer quotation system, or held of record by not less than
2,000 shareholders, and (2) cash in lieu of fractional
shares otherwise entitled to be received.

Shareholders of a New York corporation have the right to dissent
and receive payment of the fair value of their shares, in the
case of

 

	certain amendments or changes to the certificate of
	incorporation adversely affecting their rights,

 

	a merger or consolidation in which the corporation is a
	constituent corporation if the shareholder is entitled to vote
	thereon,

 

	a merger or consolidation where the shareholder is not entitled
	to vote or if the shareholders shares will be canceled or
	exchanged for cash or other consideration other than shares of
	the surviving or consolidated corporation or another corporation,

 

	any sale, lease, exchange or other disposition of all or
	substantially all the corporations assets which requires
	shareholder approval, other than a transaction wholly for cash
	which is conditioned upon the dissolution of the corporation
	within one year of the asset transaction, and

 

	certain share exchanges.

Shareholders do not have appraisal rights with respect to
mergers, consolidations and share exchanges if their shares are
listed on a national securities exchange or designated as a
Nasdaq National Stock Market security. Unlike Texas law, New
York law does not also require for denial of appraisal rights
that the shares to be received in the merger, consolidation or
share exchange are not listed on a national securities exchange,
quoted on the Nasdaq National Stock Market, or held of record by
not less than 2,000 shareholders.

The procedures for perfecting appraisal rights are similar under
New York law and Texas law. New York law provides for a
procedure for the corporation to make a written offer prior to
the commencement of litigation (the Offer) to each
dissenting shareholder to pay cash for his or her shares at a
specified, uniform price which the corporation considers to be
their fair value. If the effective date of the corporate action
dissented from has occurred, the Offer must be accompanied by an
80% advance payment of the Offer price to each dissenting
shareholder who has submitted his or her stock certificates. If
the effective date has not yet occurred, such advance payment
shall be sent forthwith upon its occurrence. If the corporation
and a dissenting shareholder agree upon a price to be paid for
such dissenting shareholders shares within 30 days
after the making of the Offer, payment in full must be made by
the corporation within 60 days of the date on which the
Offer was made or within 60 days of the effective date,
whichever is later. If any dissenting shareholder fails to agree
with the corporation during the aforesaid 30-day period, or if
an Offer is not made within a specified period of time, only
then may a proceeding for judicial appraisal be commenced.

By contrast, Texas law provides that a dissenting shareholder,
not the corporation, must make the initial determination of fair
value and include it in the shareholders written demand
for payment, which the shareholder must deliver to the
corporation within 10 days after the effective date of the
corporate action dissented from. Within 20 days after
receiving this demand for payment from a dissenting shareholder,
the existing, surviving or new corporation must deliver or mail
to the shareholder a written notice in which the corporation
either accepts the fair value claimed in the dissenters
demand and agrees to pay it within 90 days after the
effective date of the corporate action dissented from, or
provides the corporations estimate of the fair value of
the shares, together with an offer to pay the amount of that
estimate within 90 days after the date on which the
corporate action was effected, upon receipt of notice within
60 days after that date from the dissenting shareholder
that he or she agrees to accept that amount. If within
60 days after the date on which the corporate action was
effected, the shareholder and the existing, surviving or new
corporation do not agree on the fair value of the
dissenters shares, then the dissenter or the corporation
may within 60 days after the expiration of the first 60-day
period file a petition in any court of competent jurisdiction in
the county in which the principal office of the Texas
corporation is located, asking for a finding and determination
of the fair value of the dissenters shares.

The concept of fair value in payment for shares upon
exercise of dissenters rights is different under New York
law and Texas law. Under Texas law, fair value must
be determined exclusive of any appreciation or depreciation in
anticipation of the proposed action. New York law does not
exclude such element of value but mandates that the court should
consider the nature of the transaction and its effect on the

corporation and its shareholders, and the concepts and methods
of valuation then customary in the relevant financial and
securities markets.

Amendments to Charters

Texas law requires the affirmative vote of the holders of at
least two-thirds of the outstanding shares entitled to vote
thereon for any amendment to the articles of incorporation,
unless any class or series of shares is entitled to vote thereon
as a class, in which event, the proposed amendment shall be
adopted upon receiving the affirmative vote of the holders of at
least two-thirds of the shares within each class or series of
outstanding shares entitled to vote thereon as a class and of at
least two-thirds of the total outstanding shares entitled to
vote thereon.

Under New York law, amendments to a certificate of incorporation
generally must be approved by vote of a majority of the votes of
all outstanding shares entitled to vote thereon at a meeting of
shareholders. The approval of a majority of the votes of all
outstanding shares of any class of capital stock of a
corporation, voting separately as a class, is required to
approve a proposed amendment to a corporations certificate
of incorporation, whether or not such holders are otherwise
entitled to vote on such amendment by the certificate of
incorporation, that:

 

	would decrease the par value of the shares of such class, change
	any shares of such class into a different number of shares of
	the same class or into the same or a different number of shares
	of a different class, alter or change the designation, relative
	rights, preferences or limitations of the shares of such class,
	including the provision of new conversion rights or the
	alteration of any existing conversion rights, so as to affect
	them adversely;

 

	would exclude or limit the voting rights of such shares, except
	as such rights may be limited by voting rights given to new
	shares then being authorized of any existing or new class or
	series of shares; or

 

	would subordinate their rights by authorizing shares having
	preferences superior to the rights of such existing shares.

Amendments to By-laws

Under Texas law, the corporations board of directors may
amend the by-laws, unless the articles of incorporation or the
statutory provisions reserve the power exclusively to the
shareholders in whole or part, or the shareholders in amending
the by-laws expressly provide that the board of directors may
not amend the by-laws. Moreover, unless the articles of
incorporation or a by-law adopted by the shareholders provides
otherwise, a corporations shareholders may amend the
by-laws even though the by-laws may also be amended by its board
of directors. The Kent articles of incorporation provide that
the board of directors shall have the power to alter, amend, or
repeal the by-laws of the corporation or to adopt new by-laws.

Under New York law, except as otherwise provided in the
certificate of incorporation, by-laws may be amended, repealed
or adopted by a majority of the votes cast by the shares at the
time entitled to vote in the election of any directors. When so
provided in the certificate of incorporation or a by-law adopted
by the shareholders, by-laws also may be amended, repealed or
adopted by the board of directors by such vote as may be therein
specified, which vote may be greater than the vote otherwise
prescribed by New York law, but any by-law adopted by the board
of directors may be amended or repealed by the shareholders
entitled to vote thereon as provided by New York law. The Avnet
certificate of incorporation authorizes the board of directors
to adopt, amend or repeal its by-laws.

Dividends and Distributions

Texas law generally provides that the board of directors of a
corporation may authorize and the corporation may declare and
pay dividends or make other distributions on its outstanding
shares subject to any restrictions in its articles of
incorporation. Kents articles of incorporation contain no
such restrictions. However, distributions may not be made if,
after giving effect to the distribution, the corporation would be

insolvent or the distribution exceeds the surplus (defined as
the excess, if any, of net assets over stated capital) of the
corporation.

Under New York law, a corporation may declare and pay dividends,
or make other distributions in cash or its bonds or its
property, on its outstanding shares except when the corporation
is insolvent or would thereby be made insolvent, or when the
declaration, payment or distribution would be contrary to any
restrictions contained in the certificate of incorporation.
Avnets certificate of incorporation contains no such
restrictions. In general, dividends may be declared or paid and
other distributions may be made out of surplus only, so that the
net assets of the corporation remaining after such declaration,
payment or distribution shall at least equal the amount of its
stated capital.

Shareholder Action by Written Consent

Under Texas law, unless otherwise provided in the certificate of
incorporation, any action required or which may be taken at a
meeting of shareholders, may be taken without a meeting, without
prior notice and without a vote, if a written consent or
consents setting forth the action taken is signed by the holder
or holders of all the shares entitled to vote with respect to
the action that is the subject of the consent. The Kent articles
of incorporation do not authorize shareholders to act by less
than unanimous written consent.

New York law provides that shareholder action may be taken
without a meeting upon the written consent of the holders of all
outstanding shares entitled to vote, or if the certificate of
incorporation so provides, upon the written consent of holders
of outstanding shares having not less than the minimum number of
votes that would be necessary to authorize such action at a
meeting at which all shares entitled to vote thereon were
present and voted. The Avnet certificate of incorporation does
not authorize shareholders to act by less than unanimous written
consent.

Director Nominations and Shareholder Proposals

The Kent by-laws require that to properly bring a director
nomination or shareholder proposal before the annual meeting, a
shareholder must give notice thereof to the corporate secretary
not less than 90 days nor more than 120 days prior to
the first anniversary of the preceding years annual
meeting; provided, however, that in the event that the date of
the meeting is changed by more than 30 days from such
anniversary date, notice by the shareholder to be timely must be
received no later than the close of business on the
10th day following the earlier of the day on which notice
of the date of the meeting was mailed or public disclosure of
the date of the meeting was made. In the event of a special
shareholder meeting at which directors are to be elected, such
notice of nomination shall be given not later than the close of
business on the 10th day following the earlier of the day
on which notice of the date of the meeting was mailed or public
disclosure of the date of the meeting was made.

The Avnet certificate of incorporation and by-laws do not impose
any notice requirements for a director nomination or shareholder
proposal. However, any such proposal is subject to the deadlines
and conditions set out in SEC Rule 14a-8 if the proponent
wants it included in Avnets proxy materials for a meeting
of shareholders.

Special Shareholder Meetings

Under Texas law, special meetings of the shareholders may be
called by the president, the board of directors, a person
authorized by the articles of incorporation or by-laws, or by
the holders of not less than 10% of all the shares entitled to
vote at the special meeting, unless the articles of
incorporation provide otherwise, but in no event may the
articles of incorporation require a number of shares greater
than 50% to call a special meeting. The Kent by-laws provide
that special shareholder meetings may be called by the chairman
of the board, any one of thedirectors, the president or the
holders of not less than one-tenth of all the shares having
voting power at such meeting.

New York law provides that special meetings of shareholders may
be called by the board of directors and by such persons as may
be authorized in the certificate of incorporation or the
by-laws. The Avnet by-laws

provide that special meetings of the shareholders may be called
by the board of directors or the chairman of the board, and
shall be called by the chairman of the board, the president or
the secretary at the written request of shareholders owning 75%
of the shares entitled to vote at the meeting.

New York law also provides that, if, for a period of one month
after the date fixed by or under the by-laws for the annual
meeting of shareholders or, if no date has been so fixed, for a
period of 13 months after the last annual meeting, there is
a failure to elect a sufficient number of directors to conduct
the business of the corporation, the board of directors shall
call a special meeting for the election of directors. If such
special meeting is not called by the board of directors within
two weeks after the expiration of such period or if it is called
but there is a failure to elect such directors for a period of
two months after the expiration of such period, holders of 10%
of the votes of the shares entitled to vote in an election of
directors may, in writing, demand the call of a special meeting
for the election of directors.

Under Texas law, only business within the purpose or purposes
described in the notice of the shareholder meeting may be
conducted at a special meeting of the shareholders. Under New
York law, only such business may be transacted at a special
meeting which is related to the purpose or purposes set forth in
the notice of meeting.

Classified Board of Directors

As permitted by Texas law, Kents by-laws provide that its
board of directors shall be divided into three classes, as
nearly equal in number as possible as determined by the board of
directors, with the term of office of one class expiring each
year.

New York law permits the certificate of incorporation or by-laws
of a New York corporation to divide its directors into as many
as four classes with staggered terms of office. However,
Avnets certificate and by-laws do not so provide for a
classified board of directors. Therefore, all of its directors
are elected annually for one-year terms.

Removal of Directors

Under Texas law, in the case of a corporation whose directors
have been classified as permitted by statutory provisions, and
unless the articles of incorporation provide otherwise, a
director may not be removed except for cause. Kents
by-laws provide that directors may be removed only for cause and
only by the affirmative vote of the holders of 66 2/3% of
all shares of stock entitled to vote at a meeting of
shareholders, voting together as a single class.

New York law provides that any or all of Avnets directors
may be removed for cause by vote of the shareholders, and, if
the certificate of incorporation or the specific provisions of a
by-law adopted by the shareholders so provides, directors may be
removed by action of the board of directors. If the certificate
of incorporation or the by-laws so provide, any or all of the
directors may be removed without cause by vote of the
shareholders. The Avnet certificate of incorporation provides
that directors may be removed without cause by the vote of
shareholders holding a majority of the shares of Avnet common
stock. An action to procure a judgment removing a director for
cause may be brought by the attorney general of New York or by
the holders of 10% of the outstanding shares, whether or not
entitled to vote.

Vacancies on the Board

Texas law and the Kent by-laws provide that any vacancies in the
board of directors shall be filled by the board of directors,
acting by not less than a majority of the directors then in
office, even if less than a quorum. In addition, under Texas
law, any vacancies in the board of directors may also be filled
by election at an annual or special meeting of shareholders
called for that purpose.

New York law provides that newly created directorships resulting
from an increase in the number of directors and vacancies
arising for any reason may be filled by vote of the board of
directors, whether or not constituting a quorum, except that:

 

	vacancies resulting from the removal of directors without cause
	may be filled only by a vote of the shareholders, unless the
	certificate of incorporation or a specific provision of a by-law
	adopted by the shareholders provides that such a vacancy may be
	filled by a vote of the board of directors; and

 

	the certificate of incorporation or by-laws may provide that all
	newly created directorships and vacancies may be filled only by
	a vote of the shareholders.

The Avnet by-laws provide that any vacancy created by the
removal of a director by the shareholders with or without cause
may be filled only by a vote of the shareholders, and that any
vacancy created for any other reason may be filled by a vote of
the board of directors or the shareholders.

Indemnification of Directors and Officers

Texas law and New York law permit a corporation to indemnify its
directors and officers for judgments, fines and other expenses
incurred by them in connection with an action or proceeding. In
connection with any pending, threatened or completed action,
suit, or proceeding, Texas law permits such indemnification only
against judgments, penalties, fines, settlements, and reasonable
expenses actually incurred by the person in connection with the
proceeding, and New York law permits such indemnification only
against amounts paid in settlement and reasonable expenses
incurred. In New York and Texas, indemnification is permitted
only if the director or officer has acted in good faith and in a
manner he or she reasonably believed to be in (in the case of a
director acting in his official capacity as a director of the
corporation) or not opposed to the best interests of the
corporation and, with respect to any criminal proceeding, had no
reasonable cause to believe his or her conduct was unlawful.
Furthermore, both states laws provide that expenses
incurred in defending any action or proceeding may be paid by
the corporation in advance of the final disposition upon receipt
of any written undertaking by or on behalf of the director or
officer to repay the amount paid if it is ultimately determined
that he or she is not entitled to be indemnified by the
corporation. Texas law also requires a written affirmation by
the director or officer of good faith belief that the director
or officer has met the standard of conduct necessary for
indemnification.

In Texas, a provision for a corporation for indemnification and
advancement of expenses, whether contained in the articles of
incorporation, the by-laws, a resolution of shareholders or
directors, an agreement, or otherwise, is generally valid only
to the extent it is consistent with the statutory provisions.

In New York, the statutory provisions for indemnification and
advancement of expenses are not exclusive of any other rights to
which those seeking indemnification or advancement of expenses
may be entitled under the certificate of incorporation or
by-laws or, when authorized thereby, in a resolution of
directors or shareholders or an agreement providing for
indemnification. Such other rights may, for example, provide for
indemnification against judgments and fines. New York law does
not permit such other indemnification in any case where a
judgment or final adjudication adverse to the director or
officer establishes that his or her acts were committed in bad
faith or were the result of active and deliberate dishonesty and
were material to the cause of action so adjudicated, or that he
personally gained in fact a financial profit or other advantage
to which he was not legally entitled.

Avnets and Kents by-laws provide for mandatory
indemnification of directors and officers, and for advancement
of indemnified expenses, to the full extent permitted by New
York law and Texas law, respectively.

Insofar as indemnification for liabilities arising under the
Securities Act may be permitted to directors, officers or
persons controlling Avnet or Kent pursuant to the foregoing
provisions, Avnet and Kent have been informed that, in the
opinion of the SEC, such indemnification is against public
policy as expressed in the Securities Act and is, therefore,
unenforceable.

Both New York law and Texas law permit a corporation to purchase
and maintain insurance on behalf of any director or officer of
the corporation against any liability asserted against him or
her and incurred by him or her in such capacity, whether or not
the corporation would have the power to indemnify the director
or officer against such liability. The directors and officers of
Avnet are currently covered under directors and
officers liability insurance. Such insurance, subject to
annual renewal and certain rights of the insurer to terminate,
provides an aggregate maximum of $50,000,000 of coverage for
directors and officers of Avnet and its subsidiaries against
claims made during the policy period.

Limitation of Personal Liability of Directors

Texas law provides that a corporation may include in its
articles of incorporation a provision which limits or eliminates
the liability of directors to the corporation or its
shareholders for monetary damages for an act or omission in the
directors capacity as a director, except for conduct
specifically excluded from protection. Texas law does not permit
the elimination or any limitation of liability of a director for
breaching the duty of loyalty, failing to act in good faith,
engaging in intentional misconduct or a known violation of law,
obtaining an improper personal benefit from the corporation, or
violating applicable statutes that expressly provide for the
liability of a director. The Kent articles of incorporation
provide that a directors liability to Kent shall be
eliminated or limited to the fullest extent permitted by Texas
law, including any changes in the law after adoption of such
articles.

New York law provides that a corporations certificate of
incorporation may contain a provision eliminating or limiting
the personal liability of directors to the corporation or its
shareholders for damages for any breach of duty in such
capacity. However, no such provision can eliminate or limit the
liability of any director

 

	if a judgment or other final adjudication adverse to such
	director establishes that such directors acts or omissions
	were in bad faith or involved intentional misconduct or a
	knowing violation of law, that the director personally gained in
	fact a financial profit or other advantage to which such
	director was not legally entitled, or that the directors
	acts violated certain provisions of New York law, or

 

	for any act or omission prior to the adoption of such a
	provision in the certificate of incorporation.

The Avnet certificate of incorporation provides that no director
will be personally liable to Avnet or its shareholders for
damages for any breach of duty as a director, except if a
judgment or other final adjudication adverse to him or her
establishes that his or her acts or omissions were in bad faith
or involved intentional misconduct or a knowing violation of
law, or that he or she personally gained in fact a financial
profit or other advantage to which he or she was not legally
entitled, or that his or her acts violated the provision of New
York law that imposes liability on directors who vote for or
concur in

 

	the declaration of a dividend or other distribution to
	shareholders when the corporation is insolvent or would thereby
	be made insolvent or when the declaration or distribution would
	be contrary to any restrictions in the certificate of
	incorporation or when the stated capital of the corporation
	would be impaired thereby, or

 

	the purchase of shares of the corporation except out of surplus
	or, under certain limited circumstances, out of stated capital,
	or

 

	the distribution of assets to shareholders after dissolution of
	the corporation without providing for all known liabilities, or

 

	the making of a loan to a director unless authorized by vote of
	the shareholders.

ADDITIONAL INFORMATION FOR KENT AND AVNET SHAREHOLDERS

Independent Auditors Will Not Be Present at the Special
Meetings

Representatives of Grant Thornton LLP are not expected to be
present at the Kent special meeting, and representatives of
Arthur Andersen LLP are not expected to be present at the Avnet
special meeting.

Shareholder Proposals for the Next Annual Meeting

Kent has not scheduled an annual meeting for 2001 due to the
pending merger. Assuming the merger is completed, no 2001 annual
meeting will be held for Kent. If the merger were not completed,
an annual meeting of shareholders would be held before the end
of calendar year 2001. If such a meeting is held, any proposals
of Kent shareholders intended to be included in the Kent proxy
statement for such meeting would have to be received by Kent at
its corporate headquarters, 1111 Gillingham Lane, Sugar
Land, Texas 77478, attention Corporate Secretary, a reasonable
time before Kent begins to print and mail its proxy materials
with respect to such meeting.

Under Kents by-laws, a shareholder that desires to
nominate a person to be elected as a director of Kent or to
bring any other matter before an annual meeting of shareholders
must give adequate notice to Kents Secretary. To be
adequate, that notice must contain information specified in
Kents by-laws and be received by Kent not less than
90 days nor more than 120 days prior to the date that
is the one year anniversary of the previous years annual
meeting. If, however, the date of the annual meeting is changed
by more than 30 days from the anniversary date, notice of a
nomination or other matter to be brought before the annual
meeting must be received by the 10th day following the earlier
of (1) the date on which notice of the annual meeting was
mailed or (2) the date on which public disclosure of the date of
the annual meeting was made.

Avnet currently anticipates that it will hold its 2001 annual
meeting of shareholders on November 29, 2001. Any Avnet
shareholder who wishes to present a proposal for action at
Avnets 2001 annual meeting should take note that Avnet
must receive his or her proposal on or before 5:00 p.m. on
June 18, 2001, in order for it to be considered for
inclusion in Avnets proxy statement and form of proxy
relating to the 2001 annual meeting. In addition, if at the 2001
annual meeting, a shareholder makes a proposal which is not
included in Avnets proxy statement for the meeting, the
form of proxy issued with Avnets proxy statement may
confer discretionary authority to vote for or against such
shareholder proposal, unless the shareholder proponent shall
have given the Secretary of Avnet notice of such proposal prior
to September 4, 2001, and certain other conditions provided
for in the rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission are
satisfied.

THIS AGREEMENT 
and 
PLAN OF MERGER 
(this

Agreement
) is entered into as of
March 21, 2001 by and between Avnet, Inc., a New York
corporation (
Parent
), Alpha Acquisition

Corporation, a Texas corporation (
Company
).

RECITALS

WHEREAS, the respective Boards of Directors of Parent, Buyer and
Company have each approved the acquisition of Company upon the
terms and subject to the conditions set forth herein;

WHEREAS, to induce Parent and Buyer to enter into this
Agreement, (i) certain beneficial and record holders of capital
stock of Company are entering into an Inducement Agreement (the

Inducement Agreement
) with Parent, the form
of which is attached hereto as Annex A to this Agreement,
pursuant to which, among other things, such record holders have
granted to Parent an irrevocable proxy to vote their capital
stock of Company in favor of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, (ii) Larry D. Olson and Mark A. Zerbe have
each executed and delivered an employment agreement with Parent,
effective as of the Effective Time, in form and substance
acceptable to Parent, and (iii) Company is entering into an

)
granting Parent the right to acquire up to 2,863,474 shares of
common stock, without par value, of Company (
Company

therein, in the form of Annex B to this Agreement;

WHEREAS, Parent, Buyer and Company intend the Merger to qualify
as a reorganization under the provisions of Section 368(a)

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing premises and
of the representations, warranties, covenants and agreements
contained herein, the parties hereto agree as follows:

ARTICLE I

THE MERGER

Section 1.01  
The Merger
. Subject
to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, at the Effective
Time (as defined below), Buyer will be merged with and into
Company and the separate corporate existence of Buyer will
thereupon cease (the 
Merger
). Company will be
the surviving corporation in the Merger (sometimes hereinafter
referred to as the 
Surviving Corporation
) and
will continue to be governed by the laws of the State of Texas.
The separate corporate existence of Company with all its rights,
privileges, immunities, powers and franchises will continue
unaffected by the Merger and Company will succeed to all of the
rights and properties of Buyer and will be subject to all of the
debts and liabilities of Buyer.

Section 1.02  
Closing.
 The closing
of the transactions contemplated hereby (the

Closing
) will take place (i) at the
primary offices of Carter, Ledyard & Milburn at
10:00 A.M., New York time on the second business day after
the day on which the last of the conditions set forth in

Article V 
is fulfilled or waived in accordance with
this Agreement or (ii) at such other place and time or on
such other date as the parties hereto may agree (the date of the
Closing, the 
Closing Date
).

Section 1.03  
Effective Time
.
Subject to the provisions of this Agreement and provided that
this Agreement has not been terminated or abandoned pursuant to

Article VI, 
articles of merger (the

Articles of Merger
) shall be duly prepared,
executed and acknowledged by Company and thereafter delivered to
the Secretary of State of Texas for filing in accordance with
Section 5.04 of the Texas Business Corporation Act

A-5

(the 
TBCA
), on or as soon as practicable
after the Closing Date. The Merger will become effective
immediately upon the issuance of a certificate of merger by the
Secretary of State of Texas pursuant to Section 5.05 of the
TBCA (or, if the Articles of Merger provide for a subsequent
time for effectiveness, at the time thereafter so provided in
the Articles of Merger, as provided in Section 10.03 of the
TBCA); the time of such effectiveness is hereinafter referred to
as the 
Effective Time
; and the date of such
effectiveness is hereinafter referred to as the

Effective Date.

Section 1.04  
Articles of
Incorporation
. The Articles of Incorporation of Company in
effect immediately prior to the Effective Time will be the
Articles of Incorporation of the Surviving Corporation at and
after the Effective Time until duly amended in accordance with
the terms thereof and the applicable provisions of the TBCA.

Section 1.05  
By-Laws
. The By-Laws
of Company in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time
will be the By-Laws of the Surviving Corporation at and after
the Effective Time until duly amended in accordance with the
terms thereof and the applicable provisions of the TBCA.

Section 1.06  
Officers and
Directors
. The persons serving as directors of Buyer
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall continue as the
directors of the Surviving Corporation at and after the
Effective Time, and the individuals specified by Parent in
writing prior to the Effective Time shall be the officers of the
Surviving Corporation at and after the Effective Time, in each
case until their successors have been duly elected or appointed
and qualified or until their earlier death, resignation or
removal in accordance with the Surviving Corporations
Articles of Incorporation and By-Laws.

Section 1.07  
Intentionally Omitted
.

Section 1.08  
Conversion of Shares
.
Except as otherwise provided herein, at the Effective Time:

(a)  Each share of Company Common Stock (
Company
Shares
) issued and outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time (other than shares canceled pursuant to this
Section 1.08) shall, by virtue of the Merger and without
any action on the part of the holder thereof, be converted into
the right to receive 0.87 of a fully paid and nonassessable
share (
Conversion Ratio
) of Common Stock of
Parent, par value $1.00 per share (
Parent
Stock
); 
provided, however
, that if between the
date of this Agreement and the Effective Time the outstanding
shares of Company Common Stock shall have been changed into a
different number of shares or a different class, by reason of
any stock dividend, subdivision, reclassification,
recapitalization, split, combination, or exchange of shares, the
securities to be received by the shareholders of the Company
shall be appropriately and correspondingly adjusted to reflect
such stock dividend, subdivision, reclassification,
recapitalization, split, combination or exchange of shares.

(b)  Each Company Common Share held immediately prior to
the Effective Time by Company, Parent or Buyer or any of their
wholly-owned subsidiaries (other than shares held in trust or
otherwise in a representative capacity) (the 
Canceled
Shares
) shall be retired automatically, and no
consideration shall be payable with respect thereto.

(c)  Each share of common stock of Buyer, par value $1.00
per share, issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall, by virtue of the Merger and without any
action on the part of the holder thereof, be converted into one
share of common stock, without par value, of the Surviving
Corporation.

Section 1.09  
Surrender of Shares;
Transfer Books
.

(a)  
Exchange Agent
. Before the mailing of the Proxy
Statement/ Prospectus, Parent will appoint a bank or trust
company to act as exchange agent (the 
Exchange
Agent
) for the payment of the Merger Consideration.
Parent will furnish the Exchange Agent forthwith upon the
Effective Time with cash (to the extent required by
Section 1.09(e)) and certificates representing such number
of shares of Parent Stock as the Exchange Agent shall require in
order to transmit the Merger Consideration to shareholders
surrendering certificates that immediately prior to the
Effective Time represented Company Shares in accordance with
paragraph (b) of this Section 1.09.

A-6

(b)  
Exchange Procedures for Shares of Company Common
Stock
. As soon as practicable after the Effective Time,
Parent shall cause the Exchange Agent to transmit to each holder
of record of a certificate that immediately prior to the
Effective Time represented Company Shares (i) a letter of
transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be
effected, and risk of loss and title to such certificates shall
pass, only upon proper delivery of the certificates to the
Exchange Agent and shall be in customary form) and
(ii) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of
such certificates in exchange for the Merger Consideration. Each
holder of an outstanding certificate or certificates which
immediately prior to the Effective Time represented Company
Shares shall, upon surrender to the Exchange Agent of such
certificate or certificates in accordance with such letter of
transmittal, duly executed, and acceptance thereof by the
Exchange Agent, be entitled to a certificate or certificates
representing the number of full shares of Parent Stock, if any,
to be received by the holder thereof pursuant to this Agreement
and the cash, if any, payable in lieu of any fractional shares.
The Exchange Agent will accept such certificates upon compliance
with such reasonable terms and conditions as the Exchange Agent
may impose to effect an orderly exchange thereof in accordance
with normal exchange practices. After the Effective Time, there
will be no further transfer on the records of the Surviving
Corporation or its transfer agent of Company Shares which have
been converted pursuant to this Agreement into the right to
receive the Merger Consideration, and if certificates
immediately prior to the Effective Time represented Company
Shares are presented to the Surviving Corporation for transfer,
they will be canceled against delivery of certificates for
Parent Stock (and cash to the extent required by
Section 1.09(e)). If any certificate for such Parent Stock
is to be issued in, or if cash is to be remitted to, a name
other than that in which the certificate that formerly
represented Company Shares surrendered for exchange is
registered, it will be a condition of such exchange that the
certificate so surrendered will be properly endorsed, with
signature guaranteed, or otherwise in proper form for transfer
and that the person requesting such exchange will pay to the
Surviving Corporation or its transfer agent any transfer or
other taxes required by reason of the issuance of certificates
for such Parent Stock in a name other than that of the
registered holder of the certificate surrendered, or establish
to the satisfaction of the Surviving Corporation or its transfer
agent that such tax has been paid or is not applicable. Until
surrendered as contemplated by this Section 1.09(b), each
certificate that formerly represented Company Shares which have
been converted into the right to receive the Merger
Consideration will be deemed at any time after the Effective
Time to represent only the right to receive upon such surrender
the Merger Consideration as contemplated by Section 1.08
and Section 1.09(e). No interest will be paid or will accrue on
any cash payable in lieu of any fractional shares of Parent
Stock.

(c)  
Distributions with Respect to Unexchanged
Shares
. No dividends or other distributions with respect to
Parent Stock with a record date after the Effective Time will be
paid to the holder of any unsurrendered certificate that
formerly represented Company Shares with respect to the shares
of Parent Stock to be received in respect thereof and no cash
payment in lieu of fractional shares will be paid to any such
holder pursuant to Section 1.09(e) until the surrender of
such certificate in accordance with this Article I. Subject
to the effect of applicable laws, following surrender of any
such certificate, there will be paid to the holder of the
certificate representing whole shares of Parent Stock issued in
connection herewith, without interest, (i) at the time of
such surrender the amount of any cash payable in lieu of a
fractional share of Parent Stock to which such holder is
entitled pursuant to Section 1.09(e) and the proportionate
amount of dividends or other distributions with a record date
after the Effective Time theretofore paid with respect to such
whole shares of Parent Stock, and (ii) at the appropriate
payment date, the proportionate amount of dividends or other
distributions with a record date after the Effective Time but
before such surrender and a payment date subsequent to such
surrender payable with respect to such whole shares of Parent
Stock.

(d)  
No Further Ownership Rights in Company Common
Stock
. All Merger Consideration paid upon the surrender for
exchange of certificates that formerly represented Company
Shares in accordance with the terms of this Article I will
be deemed to have been issued and paid in full satisfaction of
all rights pertaining to the Company Shares represented by such
certificates.

(e)  
No Fractional Shares; Exchange Agent
.

	(i)  
No Fractional Shares
. No fractional shares of
	Parent Stock and no certificates or scrip representing
	fractional shares of Parent Stock will be issued in connection
	with the Merger, and such

A-7

	fractional share interests will not entitle the owner thereof to
	vote or to any rights of a shareholder of the Surviving
	Corporation after the Merger.

	(ii)  
Cash Payment in Lieu of Fractional
	Shares
.  Each record holder of Company Shares
	converted pursuant to the Merger who would otherwise have been
	entitled to receive a fraction of a share of Parent Stock (after
	taking into account all Company Shares held by such holder) will
	be entitled to receive, in lieu thereof upon surrender of the
	certificates that immediately prior to the Effective Time
	represented Company Shares, a cash payment (without interest) in
	lieu of such fractional share in an amount equal to the product
	of such fraction multiplied by $25.84.

	(iii)  
Termination of Exchange Agents
	Duties
.  Any holders of certificates that
	immediately prior to the Effective Time represented Company
	Shares who have not complied with this Article I within six
	months after the Effective Time will thereafter look only to
	Parent for payment of the Merger Consideration.

	(iv)  
No Liability
.  None of Parent,
	Buyer, Company or the Exchange Agent will be liable to any
	person in respect of any shares of Parent Stock (or dividends or
	distributions with respect thereto) or cash delivered to a
	public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property,
	escheat or similar law. If any certificates that immediately
	prior to the Effective Time represented Company Shares have not
	been surrendered before such date on which any shares of Parent
	Stock, any cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Stock, or
	any dividends or distributions with respect to shares of Parent
	Stock in respect of such certificate would otherwise escheat to
	or become the property of any governmental entity, any such
	shares, cash, dividends or distributions in respect of such
	certificate shall, to the extent permitted by applicable law,
	become the property of the Surviving Corporation, free and clear
	of all claims or interest of any person previously entitled
	thereto.

Section 1.10  
Options and Warrants.

(a) Prior to the Effective Time, the Board of Directors
of Company and the Board of Directors of Parent (or, if
appropriate, respective committees thereof) shall adopt
appropriate resolutions and take such action as may be required,
under the Option Plans (as defined in Section 2.02) such
that, at the Effective Time,

(i)  each Option Plan shall continue in existence and each
Option (as defined in Section 2.02) under each such Option
Plan, whether or not then exercisable, shall be assumed by
Parent and converted into an option (
Assumed
Option
) to acquire on the same terms and conditions as
were applicable under the Option, shares of Parent Stock;
provided, that the number of shares of Parent Stock subject to
such Assumed Option under such Option Plan shall be determined
by multiplying the number of shares of Company Common Stock
subject to such Option by the Conversion Ratio (with such share
number rounded down to the nearest whole number), and the
exercise price of each such Assumed Option shall be determined
by dividing the exercise price of the Option by the Conversion
Ratio (with such exercise price rounded up to the nearest
penny); provided further, however, that, in the case of any
Option to which Code Section 421 applies by reason of its
qualification under any of Code Sections 422-424, the option
exercise price, the number of shares that may be acquired
pursuant to such option and the terms and conditions of exercise
of such Option shall be determined to comply with Code
Section 425(a), and

(ii)  each Warrant (as defined in Section 2.02),
whether or not then exercisable, will be converted into a right
to acquire shares of Parent Stock, subject to terms and
conditions materially equivalent, in the reasonable judgment of
the Board of Directors of Parent, to the terms and conditions
set out in such Warrant; provided, that the number of shares of
Parent Stock subject to such right shall be determined by
multiplying the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject
to such Warrant by the Conversion Ratio (with such share number
rounded down to the nearest whole number); and the exercise
price of such right shall be determined by dividing the exercise
price of such Warrant by the Conversion Ratio.

(b)  Parent shall take all corporate action necessary to
reserve for issuance a sufficient number of shares of Parent
Stock for delivery upon exercise of the Assumed Options. As soon
as practicable after the Effective Time, Parent shall file a
registration statement on Form S-8 (or any successor or
other appropriate forms) or a post-effective amendment to the
Registration Statement, with respect to the shares of Parent
Stock subject to

A-8

the Assumed Options and shall use its best efforts to maintain
the effectiveness of such registration statement or registration
statements (and maintain the current status of the prospectus or
prospectuses in connection therewith) for so long as any Assumed
Options remain outstanding.

Section 1.11  
Affiliates.

Certificates representing Parent Stock issued to any director or
executive officer of Company or any other Person deemed by
Company to be an 
affiliate, 
for purposes of
Rule 145(c) under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended
(the Securities Act), of Company (
Company
Affiliates
) will bear an appropriate restrictive
legend. On or prior to the Closing Date, Company will deliver to
Parent a list certified by an appropriate executive officer of
Company of all persons who are then Company Affiliates. Company
will promptly amend or supplement this list as changes occur.
Company will cause each person named in any such list, amendment
or supplement to deliver promptly to Parent a letter
substantially in the form of 
Annex C 
to this Agreement.

Section 1.12  
Closing Day Payments.

On the Closing Date and without the further consent of
Parent or Buyer (provided, however, with respect to all payments
which are disclosed in the Disclosure Schedule as estimated
payments, only after reasonable consultation with Parent
concerning the actual payment amounts), Company shall be
entitled to make any payment to employees, advisors or other
parties which are conditioned in whole or in part on the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, to the
extent and only to the extent such persons and such payments are
specifically disclosed in Section 1.12 of the Disclosure
Schedule.

ARTICLE II

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF COMPANY

Company makes the representations and warranties set forth in
this Article II to Parent and Buyer. All representations and
warranties of Company set forth in this Article II are made
subject to the exceptions which are noted in the schedules
delivered by Company to Parent and Buyer concurrently herewith
and identified by the parties as the Disclosure
Schedule. The Disclosure Schedule has been delivered by
Company to Parent and Buyer on the date hereof, and the
Disclosure Schedule has been reviewed and accepted by Parent and
Buyer. Each exception noted in the Disclosure Schedule is
numbered to correspond to the applicable Section of this
Article II or other Article to which such exception refers;
provided, however, that all exceptions set forth in the
Disclosure Schedule shall be deemed to be disclosed not only in
connection with the representation and warranty specifically
referenced on a specified section of the Disclosure Schedule,
but for all purposes relating to each of the other
representations and warranties of Company set forth in this
Article II so long as the relevance of such disclosure to
such other representation or warranty is reasonably apparent
from the terms of such disclosure without investigation by
Parent or Buyer.

Section 2.01  
Organization;
Subsidiaries

(a)  Company is a corporation duly organized, validly
existing and in good standing under the laws of the State of
Texas, and, except as disclosed in Section 2.01 of the
Disclosure Schedule, each of its Subsidiaries is a corporation
duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the
laws of its jurisdiction of incorporation and is in good
standing as a foreign corporation qualified to do business in
each jurisdiction where the properties owned, leased or
operated, or the business conducted by it requires such
qualification, except for such failure to so qualify or to be in
such good standing which is not reasonably likely to have a
Company Material Adverse Effect. Company and its Subsidiaries
have the requisite power and authority to own, lease and operate
their respective properties and to carry on their respective
businesses as now being conducted.

(b)  Section 2.01 of the Disclosure Schedule lists all
Subsidiaries of Company and correctly sets forth the
capitalization of each such Subsidiary, the jurisdiction in
which Company and each such Subsidiary is organized or formed
and each jurisdiction in which Company and each such Subsidiary
is qualified or licensed to do business as a foreign
corporation. As used in this Agreement, the term

Subsidiary 
shall mean, with respect to any
party, any corporation or other organization, whether
incorporated or unincorporated or domestic or foreign to the
United States of which (a) such party or any other
Subsidiary of such party is a general partner (excluding such
partnerships where such party or any Subsidiary of such party
does not have a

A-9

majority of the voting interest in such partnership) or
(b) at least a majority of the securities or other
interests having by their terms ordinary voting power to elect a
majority of the board of directors or others performing similar
functions with respect to such corporation or other organization
is directly or indirectly owned or controlled by such party or
by any one or more of its Subsidiaries, or by such party and one
or more of its Subsidiaries. Section 2.01 of the Disclosure
Schedule correctly lists the current directors and officers of
Company and of each of its Subsidiaries. True, correct and
complete copies of the respective charter documents and by-laws
of Company and each of its Subsidiaries as in effect on the date
hereof have been made available to Buyer.
