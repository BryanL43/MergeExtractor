- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 * For purposes of calculating the filing fee pursuant to Rule 0-11(d), the
   Transaction Valuation was calculated on the basis of (i) 6,044,401
   outstanding shares of common stock, par value $.01 per share, of Exigent
   International, Inc. (the "Shares"), (ii) the tender offer price of $3.55 per
   Share, (iii) 15,132 shares of Class A Preferred Stock, par value $.01 per
   share, of Exigent International, Inc., which shares are convertible into
   Shares and have an aggregate value of $53,718, and (iv) 1,966,496 options to
   acquire Shares with an exercise price of less than $3.55 under Exigent
   International, Inc.'s (i) Incentive Stock Option Plan 1Q (Non-Qualified),
   (ii) Incentive Stock Option Plan 3Q, (iii) Incentive Stock Option Plan 4Q,
   (iv) Independent Directors Stock Option Plan (5NQ), (v) Stock Option Plan 6Q,
   and (vi) Exigent International, Inc. Omnibus Stock Option and Incentive Plan,
   with an aggregate value of $1,540,819. Based on the foregoing, the
   transaction value is equal to the sum of (1) the product of the number of
   outstanding Shares and $3.55 per Share, (2) the product of the number of
   outstanding shares of Class A Preferred Stock and $3.55 per share, and (3)
   the product of (A) 1,966,496 Shares which are subject to options to purchase
   Shares with an exercise price of less than $3.55 per share and (B) the
   difference between $3.55 per Share and the exercise price per Share of such
   options.

** The filing fee, calculated in accordance with Rule 0-11 of the Securities
   Exchange Act of 1934, is 1/50th of one percent of the aggregate Transaction
   Valuation.

                               SUMMARY TERM SHEET

     Manatee Merger Corp. is offering to purchase any and all of the outstanding
shares of common stock (including the associated Series B Junior Participating
Preferred Stock Purchase Rights) of Exigent International, Inc. for $3.55 net
per share in cash, without interest. The following are some of the questions
that you, as a stockholder of Exigent International, Inc., may have and the
answers to those questions. We urge you to read carefully the remainder of this
Offer to Purchase and the Letter of Transmittal because the information in this
summary term sheet is not complete. Additional important information is
contained in the remainder of this Offer to Purchase and the Letter of
Transmittal.

WHO IS OFFERING TO BUY MY SECURITIES?

     Our name is Manatee Merger Corp. We are a Delaware corporation and have
carried on no business other than in connection with the merger agreement. We
are a wholly owned subsidiary of Harris Corporation, a Delaware corporation. See
the "Introduction" and Section 9 of this Offer to Purchase.

WHAT ARE THE CLASSES AND AMOUNTS OF SECURITIES SOUGHT IN THE OFFER?

     We are offering to purchase all of the outstanding shares of common stock
(including the associated Series B Junior Participating Preferred Stock Purchase
Rights) of Exigent International, Inc. All references in this Offer to Purchase
to "rights" shall include all benefits that rights holders may have under
Exigent International, Inc.'s Rights Agreement and, unless the context otherwise
requires, all references to shares in this Offer to Purchase shall include the
rights associated therewith. The rights are not evidenced by separate rights
certificates and a holder of shares is not required to complete any additional
documentation or action in respect of the tender of any rights to which such
stockholder may be entitled. See the "Introduction" and Section 1 of this Offer
to Purchase.

HOW MUCH ARE YOU OFFERING TO PAY, WHAT IS THE FORM OF PAYMENT, AND WILL I HAVE
TO PAY ANY FEES OR COMMISSIONS?

     We are offering to pay $3.55 per share, net to you, in cash. If you are the
record owner of your shares and you tender your shares to us in the offer, you
will not have to pay brokerage fees or similar expenses. If you own your shares
through a broker or other nominee, and your broker tenders your shares on your
behalf, your broker or nominee may charge you a fee for doing so. You should
consult your broker or nominee to determine whether any charges will apply. See
the "Introduction" of this Offer to Purchase.

DO YOU HAVE THE FINANCIAL RESOURCES TO MAKE PAYMENT?

     Harris Corporation will provide us with sufficient funds from its own
resources to purchase all shares validly tendered and not withdrawn in the offer
and to provide funding for the merger, which is expected to follow the
successful completion of the offer. The offer is not conditioned upon any
financing arrangements. See Section 10 of this Offer to Purchase.

IS YOUR FINANCIAL CONDITION RELEVANT TO MY DECISION TO TENDER IN THE OFFER?

     We do not believe our financial condition is relevant to your decision
whether to tender your shares in the offer because the form of payment consists
solely of cash, which will be paid from cash made available to us by Harris. In
addition, the offer applies to all outstanding shares and upon completion of the
offer, we will acquire in the merger all shares that are not tendered in the
offer for the same price paid pursuant to the terms of the offer. The offer is
not subject to any financing condition. See Section 10 of this Offer to
Purchase.

HOW LONG DO I HAVE TO DECIDE WHETHER TO TENDER IN THE OFFER?

     You will have until at least 12:00 midnight, New York City time, on
Tuesday, May 15, 2001, to tender your shares in the offer, unless we extend the
offer. If you cannot deliver everything that is required in order to

                                        ii

make a valid tender by that time, you may be able to use a guaranteed delivery
procedure, which is described later in this Offer to Purchase. See Section 1,
Section 2 and Section 3 of this Offer to Purchase.

CAN THE OFFER BE EXTENDED AND UNDER WHAT CIRCUMSTANCES?

     Subject to the terms of the merger agreement, we can extend the offer to
buy your shares under certain circumstances. We agreed in the merger agreement
that we may extend (and re-extend) the offer without Exigent International,
Inc.'s consent in the following circumstances:

     - on one or more occasions (all such occasions aggregating not more than
       twenty (20) business days) beyond the latest expiration date that would
       otherwise be permitted, if, on the expiration date, any of the conditions
       to the offer have not been satisfied or waived; and

     - for any period required by any rule, regulation, interpretation or
       position of the Securities and Exchange Commission or its staff or as
       required by applicable law. See Section 15 of this Offer to Purchase.

     We also may elect to provide a "subsequent offering period" for the offer.
A subsequent offering period, if one is provided, will be an additional period
of time beginning after we have purchased shares tendered during the offer,
during which stockholders may tender their shares and receive the offer
consideration. We currently do not intend to provide a subsequent offering
period, although we reserve the right to do so. See Section 1 of this Offer to
Purchase.

HOW WILL I BE NOTIFIED IF THE OFFER IS EXTENDED?

     If we extend the offer, we will inform Mellon Investor Services, L.L.C.
(which is the depositary for the offer) of that fact and will make a public
announcement of the extension, not later than 9:00 a.m., New York City time, on
the next business day after the day on which the offer otherwise was scheduled
to expire. See Section 1 of this Offer to Purchase.

WHAT ARE THE MOST SIGNIFICANT CONDITIONS TO THE OFFER?

     We are not obligated to purchase any shares that are validly tendered,
unless the number of shares of common stock validly tendered and not properly
withdrawn before the expiration date of the offer represents at least fifty-one
percent (51%) of the total of the:

     - then outstanding shares of common stock of Exigent International, Inc.;
       plus

     - then outstanding shares of preferred stock of Exigent International,
       Inc.; plus

     - number of shares for which stock options are exercisable between the date
       that we first pay for shares and the date that the merger is completed.

     We refer to this condition as the "minimum condition." Certain stock
options that are exercisable before the date that we first pay for shares are
not exercisable after that date. If none of those stock options are exercised
before the date that we first pay for shares, the number of shares necessary to
satisfy the minimum condition represents approximately fifty-seven percent (57%)
of the presently outstanding shares. If any of those stock options are exercised
prior to the date that we first pay for shares, the number of shares necessary
to satisfy the minimum condition will increase.

     In addition:

     - we are not obligated to purchase shares that are validly tendered if
       there is a material adverse change in Exigent International, Inc. or its
       business or if certain events occur that have a material adverse effect
       on the offer.

     - we are not obligated to purchase shares that are validly tendered if
       Exigent International, Inc. fails to perform or comply in any material
       respect with its obligations under the merger agreement.

                                       iii

     - the offer also is subject to a number of other conditions. We can waive
       any of the conditions to the offer without the consent of Exigent
       International, Inc., except that we cannot waive or decrease the minimum
       condition (i.e., the requirement to purchase fifty-one percent (51%))
       without the consent of Exigent International, Inc. See Section 15 of this
       Offer to Purchase.

     Our offer is not conditioned upon any financing arrangement.

HOW DO I TENDER MY SHARES?

     To tender shares, you must deliver the certificates representing your
shares, together with a completed letter of transmittal, to Mellon Investor
Services, L.L.C., which is the depositary for the offer, prior to the time that
the tender offer expires. If your shares are held in street name, the shares can
be tendered by your nominee through The Depository Trust Company. If you cannot
get any document or instrument that is required to be delivered to the
depositary by the expiration of the tender offer, you may get some extra time to
do so by having a broker, a bank or other fiduciary that is a member of the
Securities Transfer Agents Medallion Program or other eligible institution
guarantee that the missing items will be received by the depositary within three
(3) Nasdaq SmallCap Market trading days after the date of the execution of the
notice of guaranteed delivery. For the tender to be valid, however, the
depositary must receive the missing items within that three (3) trading day
period. See Section 3 of this Offer to Purchase.

UNTIL WHAT TIME CAN I WITHDRAW PREVIOUSLY TENDERED SHARES?

     You can withdraw shares previously tendered at any time until the offer has
expired and, if we have not agreed by June 16, 2001, to accept your shares for
payment, you can withdraw them at any time after such time until we accept
shares for payment. This right to withdraw will not apply to shares tendered
during any subsequent offering period discussed in Section 1 of this Offer to
Purchase unless such shares are not immediately accepted for payment. See
Section 4 of this Offer to Purchase.

HOW DO I WITHDRAW PREVIOUSLY TENDERED SHARES?

     To withdraw shares previously tendered, you must deliver a written notice
of withdrawal, or a facsimile of one, with the required information to the
depositary while you still have the right to withdraw the shares. See Section 4
of this Offer to Purchase.

WHAT DOES EXIGENT INTERNATIONAL, INC.'S BOARD OF DIRECTORS THINK OF THE OFFER?

     We are making the offer pursuant to the merger agreement, which has been
unanimously approved by Exigent International, Inc.'s Board of Directors.
Exigent International, Inc.'s Board of Directors by unanimous vote (1)
determined that the merger agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby,
including the offer and the merger, are fair to and in the best interests of
Exigent International, Inc.'s stockholders, (2) approved and adopted the merger
agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, and (3) recommends that its
stockholders accept the offer, approve the merger agreement and the transactions
contemplated thereby, and tender their shares pursuant to the offer; provided,
however, that such recommendation may be withdrawn or modified to the extent
that Exigent International, Inc.'s Board of Directors determines in good faith
(after having consulted with outside legal counsel) that such action is
necessary in order for its directors to comply with their fiduciary duties to
Exigent International, Inc.'s stockholders under applicable law. See the
"Introduction" of this Offer to Purchase.

HAVE ANY STOCKHOLDERS PREVIOUSLY AGREED TO TENDER THEIR SHARES?

     Yes. We entered into a Voting and Tender Agreement with Bernard R. Smedley
(the Chairman of the Board and the Chief Executive Officer, and current owner of
approximately two and three-tenths percent (2.3%) of the outstanding Shares, of
Exigent International, Inc.), pursuant to which he has agreed to tender all of
his shares in the offer. Mr. Smedley will receive the same per share
consideration as you will receive for each share of Exigent International, Inc.
he tenders in the offer. Mr. Smedley also agreed that, in the event of any vote
of Exigent International, Inc.'s stockholders occurring while the Voting and
Tender Agreement is in
                                        iv

effect, he will vote his shares in favor of the merger agreement and the
transactions contemplated thereby and against certain competing transactions.

WILL THE TENDER OFFER BE FOLLOWED BY A MERGER IF ALL OF EXIGENT INTERNATIONAL,
INC.'S SHARES ARE NOT TENDERED IN THE OFFER?

     Yes. If we accept for payment and pay for a majority of the outstanding
shares of Exigent International, Inc., we will be merged with and into Exigent
International, Inc. At the time of the merger, all remaining stockholders of
Exigent International, Inc. (other than Harris and stockholders properly
exercising appraisal rights) will have their shares converted into the right to
receive $3.55 net per share in cash. See the "Introduction" and Section 13 of
this Offer to Purchase.

IF A MAJORITY OF THE SHARES ARE TENDERED AND ACCEPTED FOR PAYMENT, WILL EXIGENT
INTERNATIONAL, INC. CONTINUE AS A PUBLIC COMPANY?

     No. Following the purchase of shares in the tender offer we expect to
consummate the merger, and following the merger Exigent International, Inc. no
longer will be publicly owned. Even if for some reason the merger does not take
place, if we purchase all of the tendered shares, there may be so few remaining
stockholders and publicly held shares that Exigent International, Inc.'s common
stock will no longer be eligible to be traded on the Nasdaq SmallCap Market, The
Chicago Stock Exchange or any other securities exchange. As a result, there may
not be an active public trading market, or possibly, any public trading market,
for Exigent International, Inc.'s common stock, and Exigent International, Inc.
may cease making filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission or
otherwise cease being required to comply with the Securities and Exchange
Commission's rules relating to publicly held companies. See Section 7 of this
Offer to Purchase.

IF I DECIDE NOT TO TENDER, HOW WILL THE OFFER AFFECT MY SHARES?

     At the time of the merger described above, stockholders not tendering in
the offer will have their shares converted into the right to receive the same
amount of cash per share that they would have received had they tendered their
shares in the offer, subject to appraisal rights properly exercised under
Delaware law. Therefore, if we accept shares tendered in the offer, the only
difference to you between tendering your shares and not tendering your shares is
that you will be paid earlier and will not have appraisal rights if you tender
your shares. However, if for some reason the merger does not take place, the
number of stockholders of Exigent International, Inc. and the number of shares
of Exigent International, Inc. that are still in the hands of the public may be
so small that there no longer will be an active public trading market, or,
possibly, there may not be any public trading market, for Exigent International,
Inc.'s common stock. Also, as described above, Exigent International, Inc. may
cease making filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission or otherwise
being required to comply with the Securities and Exchange Commission's rules
relating to publicly held companies. See the "Introduction," Section 7 and
Section 13 of this Offer to Purchase.

WHAT IS THE MARKET VALUE OF MY SHARES AS OF A RECENT DATE?

     On April 2, 2001, the last completed trading day before we announced the
tender offer, the closing price of Exigent International, Inc.'s common stock
reported by Nasdaq was $1.9375 per share. On April 12, 2001, the closing price
of Exigent International, Inc.'s common stock reported by Nasdaq was $3.47 per
share. We encourage you to obtain a recent quotation for shares of Exigent
International, Inc.'s common stock in deciding whether to tender your shares.
See Section 6 of this Offer to Purchase.

WHAT ARE THE UNITED STATES FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSEQUENCES OF TENDERING MY
SHARES?

     The receipt of cash by you in exchange for your shares pursuant to the
offer or the subsequent proposed merger is a taxable transaction for federal
income tax purposes and also may be a taxable transaction under applicable
foreign, state or local tax laws. In general, assuming you hold your shares as a
capital asset, you will recognize capital gain or loss equal to the difference
between the amount of cash you receive for the shares you

                                        v

tender and your adjusted tax basis in those shares. You should consult your tax
advisor about the particular tax consequences of tendering your shares. See
Section 5 of this Offer to Purchase.

WHO CAN I TALK TO IF I HAVE QUESTIONS ABOUT THE TENDER OFFER?

     You can call Georgeson Shareholder Communications Inc. at (800) 223-2064
(toll free) or Georgeson Shareholder Securities Corporation at (800) 223-2064
(toll free). Georgeson Shareholder Communications Inc. is acting as the
information agent and Georgeson Shareholder Securities Corporation is acting as
the dealer manager for our tender offer. See the back cover of this Offer to
Purchase.

To the holders of Common Stock
of Exigent International, Inc.:

                                  INTRODUCTION

     Manatee Merger Corp., a Delaware corporation (the "Offeror") and a wholly
owned subsidiary of Harris Corporation, a Delaware corporation ("Harris"),
hereby offers to purchase any and all of the outstanding shares of common stock,
par value $.01 per share (the "Common Stock"), of Exigent International, Inc., a
Delaware corporation (the "Company"), including the associated rights to
purchase shares of the Company's Series B Junior Participating Preferred Stock
(the "Rights") authorized under the Rights Agreement, dated as of October 27,
1998, by and between the Company and Reliance Trust Company, as amended (the
"Rights Agreement") (the "Shares"), at a purchase price of $3.55 per Share (the
"Offer Price"), net to the seller in cash, without interest, upon the terms and
subject to the conditions set forth in this Offer to Purchase and in the related
Letter of Transmittal (which, together with any amendments or supplements hereto
or thereto, collectively constitute the "Offer"). All references herein to the
Rights shall include all benefits that may inure to holders of the Rights
pursuant to the Rights Agreement and, unless the context otherwise requires, all
references herein to Shares shall include the Rights. The Rights are not
evidenced by separate rights certificates and no additional action or
documentation is required for a holder of Shares to tender Rights to which such
holder may be entitled.

     Stockholders of record who hold Shares registered in their own name and
tender their Shares directly to the Depositary (as defined below) will not be
obligated to pay brokerage fees, commissions, solicitation fees or, subject to
Instruction 6 in the Letter of Transmittal, stock transfer taxes, if any, on the
purchase of Shares by the Offeror pursuant to the Offer. Stockholders who hold
their Shares through a broker, dealer, commercial bank, trust company or other
nominee should check with such institution as to whether they will be charged
any service fees. Anything in the first sentence of this paragraph to the
contrary notwithstanding, any tendering stockholder or other payee who fails to
complete and sign the Substitute Form W-9 that is included in the Letter of
Transmittal may be subject to a required federal backup withholding tax of
thirty-one percent (31%) of the gross proceeds payable to such stockholder or
other payee pursuant to the Offer. See Section 3 of this Offer to Purchase. The
Offeror will pay all charges and expenses of Georgeson Shareholder Securities
Corporation, which is acting as the Dealer Manager ("Dealer Manager"), Mellon
Investor Services, L.L.C., which is acting as the Depositary (the "Depositary"),
and Georgeson Shareholder Communications Inc. which is acting as the Information
Agent (the "Information Agent") in connection with the Offer. See Section 17 of
this Offer to Purchase.

     The Offer is being made pursuant to the Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated
as of April 2, 2001, by and among the Offeror, Harris and the Company (the
"Merger Agreement"). The Merger Agreement provides that, among other things,
after the purchase of the Shares pursuant to the Offer and the satisfaction of
the other conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement and in accordance with
the relevant provisions of the Delaware General Corporation Law, as amended (the
"DGCL"), the Offeror will be merged with and into the Company (the "Merger").
Following consummation of the Merger, the separate corporate existence of the
Offeror will cease and the Company will continue as the surviving corporation
(the "Surviving Corporation") and will be a wholly owned subsidiary of Harris.
At the effective time of the Merger (the "Effective Time"), each Share and each
share of the Company's Class A Preferred Stock, par value $.01 per share (the
"Class A Preferred Stock"), that is issued and outstanding will be converted
into the right to receive from the Surviving Corporation the Offer Price (or any
higher price that may be paid for each Share pursuant to the Offer) in cash,
without interest thereon, except for (i) Shares owned by the Company, any wholly
owned subsidiary of the Company, the Offeror, Harris or any wholly owned
subsidiary of Harris, and (ii) Shares held by stockholders who properly exercise
their appraisal rights under the DGCL. See Section 12 of this Offer to Purchase.

     In connection with the Merger Agreement, the Offeror and Harris entered
into a Voting and Tender Agreement, dated as of April 2, 2001 (the "Voting and
Tender Agreement"), with Bernard R. Smedley, the Chairman of the Board of
Directors and the Chief Executive Officer of the Company (the "Tendering
Stockholder"), pursuant to which the Tendering Stockholder agreed to tender
139,100 Shares (the

"Committed Shares") owned by the Tendering Stockholder, and any other Shares
that the Tendering Stockholder may acquire upon the exercise of options to
purchase Shares held by the Tendering Stockholder. Pursuant to the Voting and
Tender Agreement, the Tendering Stockholder also agreed that, among other
things, until the Voting and Tender Agreement Termination Date (as defined
herein), the Tendering Stockholder will not transfer the Committed Shares and
will vote the Committed Shares, if any, in favor of the Merger and against
certain competing transactions. The Committed Shares represent approximately two
and three-tenths percent (2.3%) of the Shares that, as of April 2, 2001, were
issued and outstanding.

     The Merger Agreement and the Voting and Tender Agreement are more fully
described in Section 13 of this Offer to Purchase.

     See Section 5 of this Offer to Purchase for a description of certain United
States federal income tax consequences of the Offer and the Merger.

     THE COMPANY'S BOARD OF DIRECTORS UNANIMOUSLY (1) DETERMINED THAT THE MERGER
AGREEMENT AND THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED THEREBY, INCLUDING THE TERMS OF THE
OFFER AND THE MERGER, ARE FAIR TO, AND IN THE BEST INTERESTS OF, THE HOLDERS OF
SHARES, (2) APPROVED AND ADOPTED THE MERGER AGREEMENT, THE VOTING AND TENDER
AGREEMENT, AND THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED THEREBY, INCLUDING THE TERMS OF THE
OFFER AND THE MERGER (COLLECTIVELY, THE "TRANSACTIONS"), AND (3) RECOMMENDS THAT
THE COMPANY'S STOCKHOLDERS ACCEPT THE OFFER, APPROVE THE MERGER AGREEMENT AND
THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED THEREBY, AND TENDER THEIR SHARES PURSUANT TO THE
OFFER.

     The Company's Board of Directors has received a written opinion, dated
April 2, 2001, of CIBC World Markets Corp. ("CIBC World Markets"), the Company's
financial advisor, to the effect that, as of such date and based upon and
subject to certain matters stated in such opinion, the $3.55 per Share cash
consideration to be received in the Offer and the Merger by the holders of
Shares (other than Harris and its affiliates) was fair, from a financial point
of view, to such holders. A copy of the written opinion of CIBC World Markets,
which sets forth the assumptions made, procedures followed, matters considered
and limitations on the review undertaken, is included as Annex B to the
Company's Solicitation/Recommendation Statement on Schedule 14D-9 filed with the
United States Securities and Exchange Commission (the "Commission") in
connection with the Offer, a copy of which is being furnished to stockholders
concurrently with this Offer to Purchase. Holders of Shares are encouraged to
read the full text of such opinion carefully.

     The Merger Agreement provides that, promptly after the Offeror acquires the
Shares pursuant to the Offer, the Offeror will be entitled to designate up to
such number of directors, rounded up to the next whole number, on the Company's
Board of Directors, subject to compliance with Section 14(f) of the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), as will make the
percentage of the Company's directors designated by the Offeror equal to the
percentage that the aggregate number of Shares beneficially owned by the Offeror
or any of its affiliates bears to the total number of Shares then outstanding.
The Company has agreed to take promptly all actions necessary to cause the
Offeror's designees to be so elected, including increasing the size of the
Company's Board of Directors and/or obtaining the resignation of such number of
directors as is necessary to enable the Offeror's designees to be elected or
appointed to the Company's Board of Directors.

     The Offer is conditioned upon, among other things, (i) there being validly
tendered and not withdrawn prior to the expiration of the Offer that number of
Shares constituting at least fifty-one percent (51%) of the Voting Shares (the
"Minimum Condition"), and (ii) the satisfaction of certain other terms and
conditions. See Section 15 of this Offer to Purchase. For purposes of this Offer
to Purchase, "Voting Shares" means the then outstanding Shares, together with
(a) all of the Company's then outstanding shares of Class A Preferred Stock, and
(b) all of the Shares issuable under Options (as defined in Section 13 of this
Offer to Purchase) that are or may become exercisable between the date on which
the Offeror first pays for Shares validly tendered and not withdrawn pursuant to
the Offer (the "Tender Offer Acceptance Date") and the Effective Time (as
defined below) or under any other option, warrant, convertible security or right
or other commitment or arrangement in effect on the Tender Offer Acceptance
Date.

     The Company has publicly reported that, as of April 2, 2001, there were
6,044,401 Shares and 15,132 shares of Class A Preferred Stock issued and
outstanding and that there were Options to acquire 2,621,797 Shares. Under their
respective terms, at least 1,965,528 of the Options will cease to be exercisable
on the Tender Offer Acceptance Date. Accordingly, assuming that none of the
Options are exercised prior to the Tender Offer Acceptance Date, it is
anticipated that there will be 6,715,802 Voting Shares (an aggregate of
6,059,533 Shares and shares of Class A Preferred Stock and 656,269 Shares
issuable under Options) on the Tender Offer Acceptance Date. In that event, the
Minimum Condition would be satisfied if at least 3,425,059 Shares, or
approximately fifty-seven percent (57%) of the outstanding Shares as of April 2,
2001, are validly tendered and not withdrawn prior to the Expiration Date (as
defined in Section 1 of this Offer to Purchase). In the event that, prior to the
Tender Offer Acceptance Date any Options are exercised, the number of Shares
that would constitute the Minimum Condition will be adjusted so that, after such
issuance, the Minimum Condition equals at least fifty-one percent (51%) of the
then issued and outstanding Voting Shares. See Section 13 of this Offer to
Purchase for a discussion of (i) the treatment of Options as a result of the
Merger, and (ii) the amount of money that members of the Company's Board of
Directors will receive in respect of their Options.

     If the Minimum Condition or any other condition to the Offer has not been
satisfied by 12:00 midnight, New York City time, on May 15, 2001 (or any other
time then set as the Expiration Date), the Offeror may, subject to the terms of
the Merger Agreement as described below, elect to (i) withdraw the Offer or
allow it to expire and not accept for payment any Shares and return all tendered
Shares to tendering holders of Shares, (ii) extend the Offer and, subject to
applicable withdrawal rights, retain all tendered Shares until the expiration of
the Offer, as extended. The Offeror reserves the right, in its sole discretion,
to terminate the Offer, at any time prior to accepting Shares for payment
pursuant to the Offer, if any of the conditions set forth in Section 15 of this
Offer to Purchase have not been satisfied, or waive such condition (in the case
of the Minimum Condition, with the consent of the Company) and purchase all
Shares validly tendered and not withdrawn prior to the expiration of the Offer.

     If the Minimum Condition and the other conditions to the Offer are
satisfied and the Offer is consummated, the Offeror will own a sufficient number
of Shares to ensure that the Merger will be approved. Under the DGCL, if, after
consummation of the Offer, the Offeror and/or Harris own at least ninety percent
(90%) of the Shares then outstanding and ninety percent (90%) of the shares of
Class A Preferred Stock then outstanding, then the Offeror will be able to cause
the Merger to occur without a vote of the Company's stockholders. If, however,
the Offeror and/or Harris own, directly or indirectly, more than fifty percent
(50%) but less than ninety percent (90%) of the then outstanding Shares and
shares of Class A Preferred Stock as a result of the Offer or otherwise, the
DGCL provides that the Merger may not be consummated unless holders of at least
a majority of the then outstanding shares of the Company's capital stock
affirmatively vote in favor of the Merger. In the event that the Offer is
consummated but the Offeror does not acquire at least ninety percent (90%) of
the then outstanding Shares and shares of Class A Preferred Stock as of any
scheduled Expiration Date (as defined in Section 1 of this Offer to Purchase) as
a result of the Offer or otherwise, the Company is required to duly call, give
notice of, convene and hold a meeting of its stockholders as soon as practicable
for the purpose of considering and taking action on the Merger Agreement and the
Transactions. Under those circumstances, a significantly longer period of time
will be required to effect the Merger.

                                THE TENDER OFFER

1. TERMS OF THE OFFER.

     Upon the terms and subject to the conditions of the Offer (including, if
the Offer is extended or amended, the terms and conditions of any extension or
amendment), the Offeror will accept for payment and purchase all Shares validly
tendered prior to the Expiration Date (as defined below) and not withdrawn in
accordance with Section 4 of this Offer to Purchase. The term "Expiration Date"
means 12:00 midnight, New York City time, on Tuesday, May 15, 2001, unless the
Offeror has extended the period of time for which the Offer is open, in which
event the term "Expiration Date" will mean the latest time and date at which the
Offer, as so extended by the Offeror, will expire.

     THE OFFER IS CONDITIONED UPON, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE SATISFACTION OF THE
MINIMUM CONDITION AND CERTAIN OTHER TERMS AND CONDITIONS DESCRIBED IN SECTION 15
OF THIS OFFER TO PURCHASE (COLLECTIVELY, THE "OFFER CONDITIONS"). IN ADDITION,
THE OFFEROR RESERVES THE RIGHT (BUT IS NOT OBLIGATED), IN ACCORDANCE WITH
APPLICABLE RULES AND REGULATIONS OF THE COMMISSION, AND SUBJECT TO THE
LIMITATIONS SET FORTH IN THE MERGER AGREEMENT, TO WAIVE ANY OF THE OFFER
CONDITIONS. THE MINIMUM CONDITION, HOWEVER, CAN BE WAIVED ONLY WITH THE PRIOR
WRITTEN CONSENT OF THE COMPANY. In other words, the Offeror is not required to
accept for payment or, subject to any applicable rules and regulations of the
Commission, including Rule 14e-1(c) under the Exchange Act, pay for any Shares
tendered pursuant to the Offer, and may postpone the acceptance for payment or,
subject to the restriction referred to above, payment for any Shares tendered
pursuant to the Offer, and may terminate or amend, subject to certain
limitations set forth in the Merger Agreement, the Offer (whether or not any
Shares have theretofore been purchased or paid for pursuant to the Offer) and
not accept for payment any Shares, if the Offer Conditions are not satisfied or
waived by the Offeror. Accordingly, if the Offer Conditions have not been
satisfied by 12:00 midnight, New York City time, on May 15, 2001 (or any other
time then set as the Expiration Date), the Offeror may, subject to the terms of
the Merger Agreement as described below, elect to (i) withdraw the Offer or
allow it to expire and not accept for payment any Shares and return all tendered
Shares to tendering holders of Shares, (ii) extend the Offer and, subject to
applicable withdrawal rights, retain all tendered Shares until the expiration of
the Offer, as extended, or (iii) waive such condition (in the case of the
Minimum Condition, only with the consent of the Company) and purchase all Shares
validly tendered and not withdrawn prior to the expiration of the Offer.

     The Merger Agreement provides that the Offeror will not amend or waive the
Minimum Condition without the consent of the Company, decrease the Offer Price
or the number of Shares sought, impose any further conditions to the Offer, or
amend any other term or condition of the Offer in any manner materially adverse
to the holders of the Shares. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Merger
Agreement allows the Offeror, in its sole and absolute discretion and without
the consent of the Company, to extend the Offer (i) on one (1) or more occasions
(all such occasions aggregating not more than twenty (20) business days) beyond
the current Expiration Date, if, on such Expiration Date, any of the conditions
to the Offer have not been satisfied or waived (an "Elective Extension"), (ii)
for any period required by any rule, regulation, interpretation or position of
the Commission or its staff or as required by applicable law (a "Required
Extension"), and (iii) for one (1) or more subsequent offering periods (each, a
"Subsequent Offering Period") of up to an additional twenty (20) business days
in the aggregate pursuant to Rule 14d-11 under the Exchange Act. PURSUANT TO
RULE 14d-7 UNDER THE EXCHANGE ACT, NO WITHDRAWAL RIGHTS APPLY TO SHARES TENDERED
DURING A SUBSEQUENT OFFERING PERIOD AND NO WITHDRAWAL RIGHTS APPLY DURING THE
SUBSEQUENT OFFERING PERIOD WITH RESPECT TO SHARES TENDERED IN THE OFFER AND
ACCEPTED FOR PAYMENT. During a Subsequent Offering Period, the Offeror promptly
will purchase and pay for any Shares tendered at the same price paid in the
Offer. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Merger Agreement provides that in no
event may the Offer be extended beyond the date of termination of the Merger
Agreement. The Offeror currently does not intend to provide a Subsequent
Offering Period, although it reserves the right to do so. See Section 15 of this
Offer to Purchase for the Offeror's, Harris', and the Company's termination
rights.

     In the event the Offeror chooses to extend the period during which the
Offer is open, subject to the limitations set forth in this Offer to Purchase
and the Merger Agreement, the Offeror will give oral or written notice of such
extension to the Depositary and will make a public announcement of such
extension as

discussed below. There can be no assurance that the Offeror will exercise its
right to extend the Offer. During any extension other than a Subsequent Offering
Period (see discussion above), all Shares previously tendered and not withdrawn
will remain subject to the Offer and subject to the right of a tendering holder
of Shares to withdraw such holder's Shares. See Section 4 of this Offer to
Purchase. Under no circumstances will the Offeror pay interest on the purchase
price for tendered Shares, whether or not it extends the Offer.

     Subject to the applicable rules and regulations of the Commission and
subject to the limitations set forth in the Merger Agreement, the Offeror
expressly reserves the right, at any time and from time to time, in its sole
discretion, (i) to delay payment for any Shares regardless of whether such
Shares were theretofore accepted for payment, or to terminate the Offer and not
to accept for payment or pay for any Shares not theretofore accepted for payment
or paid for, upon the failure of any of the Offer Conditions (other than a
failure arising during a Subsequent Offering Period) to be satisfied, by giving
oral or written notice of such delay or termination to the Depositary, and (ii)
at any time or from time to time, to amend the Offer. The Offeror's right to
delay payment for any Shares or not to pay for any Shares theretofore accepted
for payment is subject to the Merger Agreement and the applicable rules and
regulations of the Commission, including Rule 14e-1(c) under the Exchange Act,
relating to the Offeror's obligation to pay for or return tendered Shares
promptly after the termination or withdrawal of the Offer.

     Any extension of the period during which the Offer is open, delay in
acceptance for payment, or termination or amendment of the Offer will be
followed, as promptly as practicable, by public announcement thereof, such
announcement in the case of an extension to be issued no later than 9:00 a.m.,
New York City time, on the next business day after the previously scheduled
Expiration Date, in accordance with the public announcement requirements of Rule
14d-4(c) and Rule 14e-1(d) under the Exchange Act. Subject to applicable law
(including Rule 14d-4(d) and Rule 14d-6(c) which require that any material
change in the information published, sent or given to stockholders in connection
with the Offer be promptly disseminated to stockholders in a manner reasonably
designed to inform stockholders of such change), and without limiting the manner
in which the Offeror may choose to make any public announcement, the Offeror
shall have no obligations to publish, advertise or otherwise communicate any
such public announcement other than by issuing a press release to the Dow Jones
News Service and making any appropriate filing with the Commission.

     If, subject to the terms of the Merger Agreement, the Offeror makes a
material change in the terms of the Offer or the information concerning the
Offer, or if it waives a material condition of the Offer (including a waiver of
the Minimum Condition made with the consent of the Company), the Offeror will
disseminate additional tender offer materials (including by public announcement
as set forth above) and extend the Offer if and to the extent required by Rule
14d-4(c), Rule 14d-6(d) and Rule 14e-1 under the Exchange Act or otherwise. The
minimum period during which the Offer must remain open following material
changes in the terms of the Offer or the information concerning the Offer, other
than a change in price, the percentage of securities sought or inclusion of or
change to a dealer's soliciting fee, will depend upon the facts and
circumstances, including the materiality of the changes. In the Commission's
view, an offer should remain open for a minimum of five (5) business days from
the date the material change is first published, sent or given to stockholders,
and, if material changes are made with respect to information not materially
less significant than the Offer Price and the percentage of securities sought, a
minimum of ten (10) business days may be required to allow for adequate
dissemination to stockholders and investor response. With respect to a change in
price or, subject to certain limitations, a change in the percentage of
securities sought or the inclusion of or change to a dealer's soliciting fee, a
minimum of ten (10) business days generally is required to allow for adequate
dissemination to stockholders and investor response. Accordingly, if prior to
the Expiration Date, the Offeror decides, in its sole and absolute discretion,
to increase the consideration offered in the Offer to holders of Shares and if,
at the time that notice of such increase is first published, sent or given to
holders of Shares, the Offer is scheduled to expire at any time earlier than the
expiration of a period ending on the tenth (10th) business day from, and
including, the date that such notice is first so published, sent or given, then
the Offer will be extended at least until the expiration of such period of ten
(10) business days. For purposes of the Offer, a "business day" means any day
other than a Saturday, Sunday or a federal holiday and consists of the time
period from 12:01 a.m. through 12:00 midnight, New York City time.

     In connection with the Offer, the Company and the Company's transfer agent
have provided the Offeror with the names and addresses of all record holders of
Shares and security position listings for the purpose of disseminating the Offer
to holders of Shares. This Offer to Purchase, the related Letter of Transmittal
and other relevant materials will be mailed by the Offeror to record holders of
Shares and will be furnished by the Offeror to brokers, dealers, commercial
banks, trust companies and similar persons whose names, or the names of whose
nominees, appear on the Company's stockholder list or, if applicable, who are
listed as participants in a clearing agency's security position listing, for
subsequent transmittal to beneficial owners of Shares.

2. ACCEPTANCE FOR PAYMENT AND PAYMENT FOR SHARES.

     Upon the terms and subject to the Offer Conditions (including, if the Offer
is extended or amended, the terms and conditions of any such extension or
amendment), the Offeror will accept for payment and will pay for all Shares
validly tendered and not withdrawn in accordance with Section 4 of this Offer to
Purchase promptly after the later to occur of (a) the Expiration Date, and (b)
the satisfaction or waiver of the Offer Conditions. Subject to compliance with
Rule 14e-1(c) under the Exchange Act, the Offeror expressly reserves the right,
in its sole and absolute discretion, to delay acceptance of, or payment for,
Shares in order to comply in whole or in part with any applicable law. See
Section 1 and Section 16 of this Offer to Purchase. If the Offeror desires to
delay payment for Shares accepted for payment pursuant to the Offer, and such
delay would otherwise be in contravention of Rule 14e-1(c) under the Exchange
Act, the Offeror will extend the Offer. See Section 1 of this Offer to Purchase.

     In all cases, payment for Shares accepted for payment pursuant to the Offer
will be made only after timely receipt by the Depositary of (i) certificates
representing such Shares or a timely confirmation (a "Book-Entry Confirmation")
of a book-entry transfer of such Shares into the Depositary's account at The
Depository Trust Company (the "Book-Entry Transfer Facility"), pursuant to the
procedures set forth in Section 3 of this Offer to Purchase, (ii) a properly
completed and executed Letter of Transmittal (or a facsimile thereof), with all
required signature guarantees or, in the case of a book-entry transfer of
Shares, an Agent's Message (as defined below), and (iii) any other documents
required by the Letter of Transmittal. Accordingly, tendering holders of Shares
may be paid at different times depending upon when certificates are received by
the Depository or Book-Entry Confirmations with respect to Shares are received
into the Depositary's account at the Book-Entry Transfer Facility. UNDER NO
CIRCUMSTANCES WILL INTEREST BE PAID ON THE OFFER PRICE TO BE PAID BY THE
OFFEROR, REGARDLESS OF ANY EXTENSION OF THE OFFER OR ANY DELAY IN MAKING ANY
PAYMENT.

     The term "Agent's Message" means a message transmitted through electronic
means by the Book-Entry Transfer Facility, in accordance with the normal
procedures of such Book-Entry Transfer Facility and the Depositary, to and
received by the Depositary and forming a part of a Book-Entry Confirmation,
which states that the Book-Entry Transfer Facility has received an express
acknowledgment from the participant in the Book-Entry Transfer Facility
tendering the Shares that such participant has received and agrees to be bound
by the terms of the Letter of Transmittal and that the Offeror may enforce such
agreement against the participant.

     For purposes of the Offer, the Offeror will be deemed to have accepted for
payment, and thereby purchased, Shares validly tendered prior to the Expiration
Date and not withdrawn as, if and when the Offeror gives oral or written notice
to the Depositary of the Offeror's acceptance of such Shares for payment
pursuant to the Offer. In all cases, payment for Shares so accepted for payment
will be made by deposit of the purchase price with the Depositary, which will
act as payment agent for tendering stockholders for the purpose of receiving
payment from the Offeror and transmitting such payment to tendering
stockholders. If, for any reason whatsoever, acceptance for payment of any
Shares tendered pursuant to the Offer is delayed, or the Offeror is unable to
accept for payment Shares tendered pursuant to the Offer, then, without
prejudice to the Offeror's rights under the Offer (but subject to compliance
with Rule 14e-1(c) under the Exchange Act, which requires that the Offeror pay
the Offer Price or return the tendered Shares promptly after any termination or
withdrawal of the Offer), the Depositary may, nevertheless, on behalf of the
Offeror, retain tendered Shares, and such Shares may not be withdrawn except to
the extent that the tendering stockholders

are entitled to withdrawal rights as described in Section 4 of this Offer to
Purchase. UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES WILL INTEREST BE PAID ON THE OFFER PRICE BY
REASON OF ANY DELAY IN MAKING SUCH PAYMENTS.

     The Offeror immediately will accept for payment and promptly pay for all
Shares validly tendered during any Subsequent Offering Period. See Section 1 of
this Offer to Purchase. The procedures for tendering Shares and guaranteed
delivery set forth in Section 2 of this Offer to Purchase will apply during any
Subsequent Offering Period.

     If any tendered Shares are not accepted for payment and paid for pursuant
to the Offer for any reason, or if certificates are submitted representing more
Shares than are tendered, certificates representing such Shares will be
returned, without expense, to the tendering stockholder (or, in the case of
Shares delivered by book-entry transfer to the Book-Entry Transfer Facility,
such Shares will be credited to an account maintained within such Book-Entry
Transfer Facility), as promptly as practicable after the expiration, termination
or withdrawal of the Offer.

     IF, PRIOR TO THE EXPIRATION DATE, THE OFFEROR INCREASES THE OFFER PRICE TO
BE PAID FOR SHARES PURSUANT TO THE OFFER, THE OFFEROR WILL PAY SUCH INCREASED
OFFER PRICE FOR ALL SHARES ACCEPTED FOR PAYMENT OR PAID FOR PURSUANT TO THE
OFFER, WHETHER OR NOT SUCH SHARES WERE TENDERED, ACCEPTED FOR PAYMENT OR PAID
FOR PRIOR TO SUCH INCREASE IN THE OFFER PRICE.

     Subject to the terms of the Merger Agreement, the Offeror reserves the
right to transfer or assign, in whole or in part, to Harris or to one or more
any direct or indirect wholly owned subsidiaries of Harris, the right to
purchase Shares tendered pursuant to the Offer, but any such transfer or
assignment will not relieve the Offeror of its obligations under the Offer and
will in no way prejudice the rights of tendering stockholders to receive payment
for Shares validly tendered and accepted for payment pursuant to the Offer.

3. PROCEDURE FOR TENDERING SHARES.

     Valid Tenders of Shares. Except as set forth below, in order for Shares to
be validly tendered pursuant to the Offer, a properly completed and duly
executed Letter of Transmittal (or a facsimile thereof), together with any
required signature guarantees for Shares, or, in the case of a book-entry
transfer of Shares, an Agent's Message, and any other documents required by the
Letter of Transmittal, must be received by the Depositary at one of its
addresses set forth on the back cover of this Offer to Purchase prior to the
Expiration Date. In addition, either (i) certificates representing tendered
Shares must be received by the Depositary along with the Letter of Transmittal,
or such Shares must be tendered pursuant to the procedure for book-entry
transfer set forth below, and a Book-Entry Confirmation must be received by the
Depositary, in each case prior to the Expiration Date, or (ii) the guaranteed
delivery procedures set forth below must be complied with. No alternative,
conditional or contingent tenders will be accepted.

     THE METHOD OF DELIVERY OF SHARES, THE LETTER OF TRANSMITTAL AND ALL OTHER
REQUIRED DOCUMENTS, INCLUDING DELIVERY THROUGH THE BOOK-ENTRY TRANSFER FACILITY,
IS AT THE OPTION AND SOLE RISK OF THE TENDERING STOCKHOLDER. SHARES, THE LETTER
OF TRANSMITTAL AND ALL OTHER REQUIRED DOCUMENTS WILL BE DEEMED DELIVERED ONLY
WHEN ACTUALLY RECEIVED BY THE DEPOSITARY (INCLUDING, IN THE CASE OF A BOOK-ENTRY
TRANSFER OF SHARES, BY A BOOK-ENTRY CONFIRMATION). IF DELIVERY IS BY MAIL,
REGISTERED MAIL WITH RETURN RECEIPT REQUESTED, PROPERLY INSURED, IS RECOMMENDED.
IN ALL CASES, SUFFICIENT TIME SHOULD BE ALLOWED TO ENSURE TIMELY DELIVERY.

     Book-Entry Transfer of Shares. The Depositary will establish an account
with respect to the Shares at the Book-Entry Transfer Facility for purposes of
the Offer. Any financial institution that is a participant in the Book-Entry
Transfer Facility's system may make book-entry delivery of Shares by causing the
Book-Entry Transfer Facility to transfer such Shares into the Depositary's
account at the Book-Entry Transfer Facility in accordance with the Book-Entry
Transfer Facility's procedures for transfer. However, although delivery of
Shares may be effected through book-entry transfer into the Depositary's account
at the Book-Entry Transfer Facility, a properly completed and duly executed
Letter of Transmittal (or a facsimile thereof), with any required signature
guarantees, or an Agent's Message in connection with a book-entry transfer, and
any other required documents, must, in any case, be transmitted to and received
by the Depositary at one of its addresses set forth on the back cover of this
Offer to Purchase prior to the Expiration Date or the guaranteed delivery

procedures described below must be complied with. DELIVERY OF DOCUMENTS TO THE
BOOK-ENTRY TRANSFER FACILITY DOES NOT CONSTITUTE DELIVERY TO THE DEPOSITARY.

     Signature Guarantee for Shares. All signatures on the Letter of Transmittal
must be guaranteed by a bank, broker, dealer, credit union, savings association
or other entity that is a member in good standing of the Security Transfer
Agent's Medallion Program or by any other bank, broker, dealer, credit union,
savings association or other entity that is an "eligible guarantor institution,"
as such term is defined in Rule 17Ad-15 under the Exchange Act (each, an
"Eligible Institution"), unless (i) such Letter of Transmittal is signed by the
registered holder of the Shares tendered therewith, unless such holder has
completed either the box labeled "Special Delivery Instructions" or the box
labeled "Special Payment Instructions" on the Letter of Transmittal, or (ii)
Shares are tendered for the account of any Eligible Institution.

     If a certificate representing Shares is registered in the name of a person
or persons other than the signatory of the Letter of Transmittal, or if payment
is to be made or delivered to, or certificates for unpurchased Shares are to be
issued or returned to, a person other than the registered holder, then the
tendered certificates must be endorsed or accompanied by duly executed stock
powers, in either case signed exactly as the name or names of the registered
stockholder or stockholders appear on the certificates, with the signatures on
the certificates or stock powers guaranteed by an Eligible Institution as
provided in the Letter of Transmittal. If the Letter of Transmittal or stock
powers are signed or any certificate is endorsed by trustees, executors,
administrators, guardians, attorneys-in-fact, officer of corporations or others
acting in a fiduciary or representative capacity, such persons should so
indicate when signing and, unless waived by the Offeror, proper evidence
satisfactory to the Offeror of their authority to so act must be submitted. See
Instruction 1 and Instruction 5 in the Letter of Transmittal.

     If the certificates are forwarded separately to the Depositary, a properly
completed and duly executed Letter of Transmittal (or a facsimile thereof) must
accompany each such delivery.

     Guaranteed Delivery of Shares. If a stockholder desires to tender Shares
pursuant to the Offer and such stockholder's certificates representing Shares
are not immediately available or time will not permit all required documents to
reach the Depositary prior to the Expiration Date or the procedures for
book-entry transfer of Shares cannot be completed on a timely basis, such Shares
may nevertheless be tendered if all of the following guaranteed delivery
procedures are duly complied with:

          (i) the tender is made by or through an Eligible Institution;

          (ii) a properly completed and duly executed Notice of Guaranteed
     Delivery, substantially in the form provided by the Offeror, is received by
     the Depositary, as provided below, prior to the Expiration Date; and

          (iii) (A) the certificates (or a Book-Entry Confirmation) representing
     all tendered Shares, in proper form for transfer together with a properly
     completed and duly executed Letter of Transmittal (or a facsimile thereof),
     and any required signature guarantees, or, in the case of a book-entry
     transfer, an Agent's Message, and (B) any other documents required by the
     Letter of Transmittal are received by the Depositary within three (3)
     trading days after the date of execution of such Notice of Guaranteed
     Delivery. The term "trading day" means any day on which the Nasdaq SmallCap
     Market is open for business.

     The Notice of Guaranteed Delivery may be delivered by hand or transmitted
by facsimile transmission or mail to the Depositary and must include (i) a
guarantee by an Eligible Institution in the form set forth in the Notice of
Guaranteed Delivery, and (ii) a representation that the stockholder on whose
behalf the tender is being made is deemed to own the Shares being tendered
within the meaning of Rule 14e-4 under the Exchange Act.

     BACKUP FEDERAL INCOME TAX WITHHOLDING. TO PREVENT "BACKUP" FEDERAL INCOME
TAX WITHHOLDING EQUAL TO THIRTY-ONE PERCENT (31%) OF THE GROSS PAYMENTS RECEIVED
PURSUANT TO THE OFFER, EACH TENDERING STOCKHOLDER MUST, SUBJECT TO CERTAIN
EXCEPTIONS, PROVIDE THE DEPOSITARY WITH SUCH STOCKHOLDER'S CORRECT TAXPAYER
IDENTIFICATION NUMBER ("TIN") AND CERTIFY THAT SUCH STOCKHOLDER IS NOT SUBJECT
TO BACKUP FEDERAL INCOME TAX

WITHHOLDING BY COMPLETING THE SUBSTITUTE FORM W-9 INCLUDED IN THE LETTER OF
TRANSMITTAL. FOREIGN STOCKHOLDERS GENERALLY MUST SUBMIT A PROPERLY COMPLETED
FORM W-8, CERTIFYING NON-UNITED STATES STATUS, TO AVOID BACKUP WITHHOLDING. SUCH
FORMS MAY BE OBTAINED FROM THE DEPOSITARY. FOR A DISCUSSION OF THE MATERIAL
FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSEQUENCES TO TENDERING SHARES IN THE OFFER, SEE SECTION 5
OF THIS OFFER TO PURCHASE. ALSO SEE INSTRUCTION 8 AND INSTRUCTION 9 IN THE
LETTER OF TRANSMITTAL.

     Determination of Validity. All questions as to the form of documents and
the validity, eligibility (including time of receipt) and acceptance for payment
of all tendered Shares will be determined by the Offeror, in its sole and
absolute discretion, and its determination will be final and binding on all
persons. The Offeror reserves the absolute right to reject any or all tenders of
any Shares that it determines are not in proper form or the acceptance of or
payment for which may, in the opinion of the Offeror's counsel, be unlawful. The
Offeror also reserves the absolute right to waive any of the Offer Conditions,
subject to applicable law and the limitations set forth in the Merger Agreement,
or any defect or irregularity in the tender of any Shares whether or not similar
defects or irregularities are waived in the case of other stockholders. The
Minimum Condition, however, can be waived only with the consent of the Company.
The Offeror's interpretation of the terms and conditions of the Offer (including
the Letter of Transmittal and the Instructions to the Letter of Transmittal)
will be final and binding on all persons. No tender of Shares will be deemed to
have been validly made until all defects and irregularities relating thereto
have been cured or waived to the satisfaction of the Offeror. None of the
Offeror, Harris, the Depositary, the Dealer Manager, the Information Agent or
any other person will be under any duty to give notification of any defects or
irregularities in tenders, nor shall any of them incur any liability for failure
to give any such notification.

     Other Requirements. By executing the Letter of Transmittal as set forth
above (including through delivery of an Agent's Message), a tendering
stockholder irrevocably appoints designees of the Offeror as such stockholder's
agents, attorneys-in-fact and proxies, each with full power of substitution, in
the manner set forth in the Letter of Transmittal, to exercise all voting and
other rights of such stockholder as each such agent, attorney-in-fact and proxy
or his, her or its substitute shall in his, her or its sole judgment deem
proper, with respect to all of the Shares tendered by such holder and accepted
for payment by the Offeror (and any and all other Shares or other rights or
securities issued or issuable in respect of such Shares on or after the date of
this Offer to Purchase). All such powers of attorney and proxies will be
considered irrevocable and coupled with an interest in the tendered Shares. This
appointment is effective if, when, and only to the extent that, the Offeror
accepts such Shares for payment pursuant to the Offer. Upon such acceptance for
payment, all prior powers of attorney, proxies and written consents granted by
such stockholder at any time with respect to such Shares or other securities or
rights issued or issuable in respect of such Shares will, without further
action, be revoked and no subsequent powers of attorney or proxies may be given
or written consents executed by such stockholder (and, if given or executed,
will not be deemed effective). Such designees of the Offeror, with respect to
the Shares and other securities or rights issued or issuable in respect of such
Shares, will be empowered to exercise all voting and other rights of such
stockholder as they, in their sole and absolute discretion, deem proper in
respect of any annual or special meeting of the Company's stockholders, or any
adjournment or postponement thereof, any actions by written consent in lieu of
any such meeting or otherwise. In order for Shares to be deemed validly
tendered, immediately upon the Offeror's payment for such Shares, the Offeror
must be able to exercise full voting and other rights with respect to such
Shares and the other securities or rights issued or issuable in respect of such
Shares, including voting at any meeting of stockholders (whether annual or
special or whether or not adjourned).

     A tender of Shares pursuant to any of the procedures described above will
constitute the tendering stockholder's acceptance of the terms and conditions of
the Offer, as well as the tendering stockholder's representation and warranty to
the Offeror that (i) such stockholder has the full power and authority to
tender, sell, assign and transfer the tendered Shares (and any and all Shares or
other securities issued or issuable in respect of such Shares), (ii) when the
same are accepted for payment by the Offeror, the Offeror will acquire good and
unencumbered title thereto, free and clear of all liens, restrictions, charges
and encumbrances and not subject to any adverse claims, (iii) such stockholder
has a net long position in such Shares being tendered within the meaning of Rule
14e-4 under the Exchange Act, and (iv) the tender of such Shares complies with
Rule 14e-4 under the Exchange Act. It is a violation of Rule 14e-4 under the
Exchange Act for a person,

directly or indirectly, to tender Shares for such person's own account unless,
at the time of tender, the person so tendering (i) has a net long position equal
to or greater than the amount of (x) the Shares tendered, or (y) other
securities immediately convertible into or exchangeable or exercisable for the
Shares tendered and such person will acquire such Shares for tender by
conversion, exchange or exercise, and (ii) will cause such Shares to be
delivered in accordance with the terms of the Offer. Rule 14e-4 provides a
similar restriction applicable to the tender or guarantee of a tender on behalf
of another person.

     Tender Constitutes an Agreement. The Offeror's acceptance for payment of
Shares tendered pursuant to the Offer will constitute a binding agreement
between the tendering stockholder and the Offeror upon the terms and subject to
the conditions of the Offer.

4. WITHDRAWAL RIGHTS.

     Except as otherwise provided in this Section 4, tenders of Shares made
pursuant to the Offer are irrevocable. Shares tendered pursuant to the Offer may
be withdrawn at any time prior to the Expiration Date and, unless previously
accepted for payment pursuant to the Offer, also may be withdrawn at any time
after June 16, 2001. If the Offeror extends the Offer, is delayed in its
acceptance for payment of any Shares tendered, or is unable to accept for
payment or pay for Shares tendered pursuant to the Offer for any reason
whatsoever, then, without prejudice to the Offeror's rights under the Offer, the
Depositary may, on behalf of the Offeror, retain tendered Shares, and such
Shares may not be withdrawn except to the extent that the tendering stockholders
are entitled to and duly exercise withdrawal rights as set forth in this Section
4. No withdrawal rights will apply to Shares tendered into a Subsequent Offering
Period and no withdrawal rights apply during the Subsequent Offering Period with
respect to Shares tendered in the Offer and accepted for payment.

     For a withdrawal of Shares tendered pursuant to the Offer to be effective,
a written or facsimile transmission notice of withdrawal must be timely received
by the Depositary at one of its addresses set forth on the back cover of this
Offer to Purchase. Any notice of withdrawal must specify the name of the person
who tendered the Shares to be withdrawn, the number of Shares to be withdrawn
and the name(s) in which the certificates representing such Shares are
registered, if different from the name of the person who tendered such Shares.
If certificates representing Shares to be withdrawn have been delivered or
otherwise identified to the Depositary, then, prior to the physical release of
such certificates, the name(s) of the registered holder(s) and the serial
numbers shown on such certificates also must be submitted to the Depositary and,
unless such Shares have been tendered for the account of an Eligible
Institution, the signatures on the notice of withdrawal must be guaranteed by an
Eligible Institution. If Shares have been tendered pursuant to the procedures
for book-entry transfer set forth in Section 3 of this Offer to Purchase, any
notice of withdrawal also must specify the name and number of the account at the
Book-Entry Transfer Facility to be credited with such withdrawn Shares and
otherwise must comply with such Book-Entry Transfer Facility's procedures.

     Withdrawals of tenders of Shares may not be rescinded, and Shares properly
withdrawn thereafter will be deemed not validly tendered for purposes of the
Offer. However, withdrawn Shares may be retendered at any subsequent time prior
to the Expiration Date or during a Subsequent Offering Period by again following
any of the procedures described in Section 3 of this Offer to Purchase. See
Section 1 of this Offer to Purchase.

     All questions as to the form and validity (including time of receipt) of a
notice of withdrawal will be determined by the Offeror, in its sole and absolute
discretion, and its determination will be final and binding on all persons. None
of the Offeror, Harris, the Depositary, the Dealer Manager, the Information
Agent or any other person will be under any duty to give notification of any
defects or irregularities in any notice of withdrawal, nor shall any of them
incur any liability for failure to give any such notification.

5. CERTAIN UNITED STATES FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSEQUENCES.

     The following is a summary of certain United States federal income tax
consequences of the Offer and the Merger to beneficial owners of Shares whose
Shares are purchased pursuant to the Offer or whose Shares are converted to cash
in the Merger. The discussion is for general information only and does not
purport to consider all aspects of United States federal income taxation that
might be relevant to beneficial owners of

Shares. The discussion is based on current provisions of the Internal Revenue
Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"), proposed, temporary and final regulations
promulgated thereunder, and administrative and judicial interpretations thereof,
all of which are subject to change possibly on a retroactive basis. The
discussion applies only to beneficial owners of Shares in whose hands Shares are
capital assets within the meaning of Section 1221 of the Code, and may not apply
to Shares received pursuant to the exercise of employee stock options or
otherwise as compensation, or to certain types of beneficial owners of Shares
(such as banks, insurance companies, tax-exempt organizations, mutual funds,
financial institutions and broker-dealers) who might be subject to special
rules. This discussion does not discuss the federal income tax consequences to a
holder of Shares that is an Employee Stock Ownership Plan, as defined in Section
4975(e)(7) of the Code, or to the participants of any such plan. In addition,
this discussion does not discuss the United States federal income tax
consequences to a beneficial owner of Shares who is not a U.S. Holder (as
defined below) for United States federal income tax purposes, nor does it
consider the effect of any foreign, state or local tax laws. For purposes of
this Offer to Purchase, "U.S. Holder" means a holder of Shares who or which is
(i) an individual who is a citizen or resident of the United States for United
States federal income tax purposes, (ii) a corporation or other entity taxable
as a corporation, or a limited partnership, limited liability company or other
entity taxable as a partnership, created or organized under the laws of the
United States or any state thereof (including the District of Columbia), (iii)
an estate the income of which is subject to United States federal income tax
regardless of its source, or (iv) a trust if a court within the United States is
able to exercise primary supervision over the administration of the trust and
one (1) or more United States persons have the authority to control all
substantial decisions of the trust.

     BECAUSE INDIVIDUAL CIRCUMSTANCES MAY DIFFER, EACH BENEFICIAL OWNER OF
SHARES SHOULD CONSULT SUCH BENEFICIAL OWNER'S OWN TAX ADVISOR TO DETERMINE THE
APPLICABILITY OF THE RULES DISCUSSED BELOW TO SUCH BENEFICIAL OWNER AND THE
PARTICULAR TAX EFFECTS TO SUCH BENEFICIAL OWNER OF THE OFFER AND THE MERGER,
INCLUDING THE APPLICATION AND EFFECT OF STATE, LOCAL AND OTHER TAX LAWS.

     The receipt of cash for Shares pursuant to the Offer or the receipt of cash
for Shares pursuant to the Merger will be a taxable transaction for United
States federal income tax purposes (and also may be a taxable transaction under
applicable state, local or other tax laws). In general, for United States
federal income tax purposes, a beneficial owner of Shares will recognize gain or
loss equal to the difference (if any) between the amount of cash received and
such beneficial owner's adjusted tax basis in the Shares sold pursuant to the
Offer or Shares converted to cash in the Merger (or adjusted pursuant to the
Merger). Gain or loss must be determined separately for each block of Shares
(i.e., Shares acquired at the same cost in a single transaction) sold pursuant
to the Offer or converted to cash in the Merger. In general, such gain or loss
will be capital gain or loss and will be long-term capital gain or loss if the
beneficial owner held the Shares for more than one (1) year as of the date of
sale (in the case of the Offer) or held the Shares for more than one (1) year as
of the Effective Time (in the case of the Merger). The excess of net long-term
capital gains over net short-term capital losses currently is taxed at a maximum
rate of twenty percent (20%) for noncorporate taxpayers. The receipt of cash for
Shares pursuant to the exercise of appraisal rights, if any, generally will be
taxed in the same manner described above.

     Payments in connection with the Offer or the Merger might be subject to
"backup withholding" at a rate of thirty-one percent (31%), unless a beneficial
owner of Shares (a) is a corporation or comes within certain exempt categories
and, when required, demonstrates this fact, or (b) provides a correct TIN to the
Depositary, certifies as to no loss of exemption from backup withholding and
otherwise complies with applicable requirements of the backup withholding rules.
A beneficial owner who does not provide a correct TIN may be subject to
penalties imposed by the Internal Revenue Service. Any amount paid as backup
withholding does not constitute an additional tax and will be creditable against
the beneficial owner's United States federal income tax liability. Each
beneficial owner of Shares should consult with his or her own tax advisor as to
his or her qualification for exemption from backup withholding and the procedure
for obtaining such exemption. Those tendering their Shares in the Offer may
prevent backup withholding by completing the Substitute Form W-9 included in the
Letter of Transmittal. See Section 3 of this Offer to Purchase. Similarly, those
who convert their Shares into cash in the Merger may prevent backup withholding
by completing the Substitute Form W-9 provided by the paying agent for the
Merger.

     The Offeror and Harris will be entitled to deduct and withhold from the
consideration otherwise payable in connection with the Offer or the Merger to
any holder of Shares such amounts as the Offeror or Harris is required to deduct
and withhold with respect to the making of such payment. To the extent that
amounts are so withheld by the Offeror or Harris, such withheld amounts shall be
treated for all purposes of the Merger Agreement as having been paid to the
holder of the Shares in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made
by the Offeror or Harris.

     The Rights trade together with the Common Stock. On April 2, 2001, the last
full day of trading prior to the public announcement of the execution of the
Merger Agreement, according to publicly available sources, the reported closing
price per Share on the Nasdaq SmallCap Market was $1.9375. On April 12, 2001,
the reported closing price per Share on the Nasdaq SmallCap Market was $3.47.
HOLDERS OF SHARES ARE URGED TO OBTAIN CURRENT MARKET QUOTATIONS FOR THE SHARES.

     The Company has not declared or paid any cash dividends on the Shares. In
addition, the Merger Agreement prohibits the Company from declaring or paying
any dividends on the Shares prior to the date (the "Offeror Election Date") on
which the Offeror or Harris has the right to designate members of the Company's
Board of Directors, as discussed in Section 12 and Section 13 of this Offer to
Purchase.

7. CERTAIN EFFECTS OF THE TRANSACTION.

     Effect on the Market for the Shares. The purchase of the Shares by the
Offeror pursuant to the Offer will reduce the number of Shares that otherwise
might trade publicly and will reduce the number of holders of Shares.
Consequently, depending upon the number of Shares purchased and the number of
remaining holders of Shares, the purchase of Shares pursuant to the Offer could
adversely affect the liquidity and market value of the remaining Shares held by
the public. The Company has advised the Offeror that, as of March 30, 2001,
there were approximately 1,106 holders of record and approximately 1,900
beneficial owners of the Shares. The Offeror cannot predict whether the
reduction in the number of Shares that might otherwise trade publicly would have
an adverse or beneficial effect on the market price for or marketability of the
Shares or whether it would cause future market prices to be greater or less than
the Offer Price.

     Stock Quotations. The Shares currently are listed and traded on the Nasdaq
SmallCap Market, and The Chicago Stock Exchange, which constitute the principal
trading markets for the Shares. Depending upon the aggregate market value and
the number of Shares purchased pursuant to the Offer, the Shares no longer may
meet the standards for continued listing on the Nasdaq SmallCap Market and/or
The Chicago Stock Exchange. According to its published guidelines, the Nasdaq
SmallCap Market normally will consider suspending dealings in, or removing from
the list, the common stock of a company that does not have (i) $2,000,000 in net
tangible assets, $35,000,000 in market capitalization, or $500,000 net income in
the latest fiscal year or two (2) of the last three (3) fiscal years, (ii) a
public float of five hundred thousand (500,000) shares with a market value equal
to $1,000,000, (iii) two (2) market makers; (iv) a minimum bid price of $1.00
per share of common stock, and (v) three hundred (300) shareholders (defined as
round lot holders who own one hundred (100) or more shares of common stock).
According to its published guidelines, The Chicago Stock Exchange normally will
consider suspending dealings in, or removing from the list, the common stock of
a company that does not have (i) net tangible assets of at least (a) $2,000,000
if the issuer has sustained losses from continuing operations and/or net losses
in two (2) of its three (3) most recent fiscal years, or (b) $4,000,000 if the
issuer has sustained losses from continuing operations and/or net losses in
three (3) of its four (4) most recent fiscal years, (ii) a public distribution
of at least four hundred (400) public beneficial shareholders, or at least three
hundred (300) beneficial holders of one hundred shares (100) shares or more,
provided that, in either case, there must be at least two hundred thousand
(200,000) publicly held shares, and (iii) at least $1,000,000 aggregate market
value. Shares held, directly or indirectly, by an officer or director of the
Company or their immediate families, or by any beneficial owner of more than ten
percent (10%) of the Shares, ordinarily will not be considered as being publicly
held for this purpose.

     If, as a result of the purchase of Shares pursuant to the Offer, the Shares
no longer meet the requirements for continued listing on the Nasdaq SmallCap
Market or The Chicago Stock Exchange, the market for the Shares could be
affected adversely. In the event the Shares no longer are eligible for
quotations on the Nasdaq SmallCap Market or The Chicago Stock Exchange,
quotations still might be available from other sources. The extent of the public
market for the Shares and the availability of such quotations would, however,
depend upon the number of holders of such Shares remaining at such time, the
interest in maintaining a market in such Shares on the part of securities firms,
the possible termination of registration of such Shares under the Exchange Act
as described below and other factors.

     Exchange Act Registration. The Shares currently are registered under the
Exchange Act. Such registration may be terminated upon application by the
Company to the Commission if the Shares are not listed on a national securities
exchange or held by three hundred (300) or more holders of record. It is the
Offeror's intention to seek to cause an application for such termination to be
made as soon after consummation of the Offer as the requirements for termination
of registration of the Shares are met. If such registration was terminated,
certain provisions of the Exchange Act no longer would apply to the Shares of
the Company. For instance, the Company no longer would be required to disclose
publicly in proxy materials distributed to stockholders the information that it
now must provide under the Exchange Act or to make public disclosure of
financial and other information in annual, quarterly and other reports required
to be filed with the Commission under the Exchange Act; the Company no longer
would be subject to Rule 13e-3 under the Exchange Act relating to "going
private" transactions; and the officers, directors and ten percent (10%)
stockholders of the Company no longer would be subject to the "short-swing"
insider trading reporting and profit recovery provisions under the Exchange Act.
Furthermore, if such registration was terminated, the ability of "affiliates" of
the Company and persons holding "restricted securities" of the Company to
dispose of such securities under Rule 144 or Rule 144A promulgated under the
Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act"), may be impaired, or,
with respect to certain persons, eliminated.

     Even if registration of the Shares is not terminated prior to the Merger,
following the consummation of the Merger the Shares no longer will be eligible
for Nasdaq SmallCap Market or The Chicago Stock Exchange listing and quotation
and the registration of the Shares under the Exchange Act will be terminated.

     Margin Regulations. The Shares are currently "margin securities" under the
regulations of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (the
"Federal Reserve Board"), which has the effect, among other things, of allowing
brokers to extend credit on the collateral of such Shares for the purpose of
buying, carrying

or trading in securities ("Purpose Loans"). Depending upon factors similar to
those described above regarding listing and market quotations, it is possible
that, following the Offer, the Shares no longer would constitute "margin
securities" for purposes of the margin regulations of the Federal Reserve Board
and therefore no longer could be used as collateral for Purpose Loans made by
brokers. If registration of Shares under the Exchange Act was terminated, such
Shares no longer would be "margin securities."

     Other Financial Information. The Company does not, as a matter of course,
make public any forecasts or projections as to its financial performance.
However, in the course of the discussions and information exchange between
representatives of Harris and the Company, which is described in Section 11 of
this Offer to Purchase, the Company provided Harris with certain information
about the Company and its financial performance that we believe is not publicly
available. The information provided included projected financial information for
the fiscal years ending December 31, 2001 and December 31, 2002 (the
"Projections"). The Projections were prepared by the Company's management for
internal planning and budgeting purposes only. The projections included
estimates of (i) net sales of $42.0 million and $46.2 million for the Company's
fiscal years ending December 31, 2001 and December 31, 2002, respectively, and
(ii) earnings before interest and taxes of $1.5 and $1.7 million for the
Company's fiscal years ending December 31, 2001 and December 31, 2002,
respectively. None of the assumptions underlying the Projections give effect to
the Offer or the Merger.

     The Company advised the Offeror and Harris that the Projections were not
prepared with a view to public disclosure or in compliance with published
guidelines of the Commission or the guidelines established by the American
Institute of Certified Public Accountants regarding projections. A reference to
the Projections is included in this Offer to Purchase only because they were
provided to Harris during the evaluation of the Company. The Projections contain
forward-looking statements, do not purport to present results of operations in
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and have not been
audited, compiled or examined by the Company's independent auditors. The summary
of projected financial data set forth in the paragraph above is presented for
the limited purpose of giving the Company's stockholders access to financial
data prepared by the Company's management that was made available to Harris in
connection with its evaluation of the Company. While presented with numerical
specificity, the Projections are based upon a variety of

assumptions relating to commercial acceptance of the Company's products and
technology, industry performance, general business and economic conditions, the
business of the Company and other matters that may not be realized and are
subject to significant uncertainties and contingencies, many of which are beyond
the control of the Company. There can be no assurance that the Projections will
be realized, and actual results may vary materially from those shown. The
inclusion of such Projections herein should not be regarded as an indication
that the Offeror, Harris, the Company or any of their respective affiliates or
representatives considers the Projections an accurate prediction of future
events. Harris performed an independent assessment of the Company's value and
did not rely to any material degree upon the Projections.

     THE FOREGOING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS ARE SUBJECT TO CERTAIN RISKS AND
UNCERTAINTIES THAT COULD CAUSE ACTUAL RESULTS TO DIFFER MATERIALLY FROM THE
PROJECTIONS. THE COMPANY HAS ADVISED THE OFFEROR AND HARRIS THAT ITS INTERNAL
FINANCIAL FORECASTS (UPON WHICH THE PROJECTIONS PROVIDED TO HARRIS WERE BASED IN
PART) ARE, IN GENERAL, PREPARED SOLELY FOR INTERNAL USE AND CAPITAL BUDGETING
AND OTHER MANAGEMENT DECISIONS, AND ARE SUBJECTIVE IN MANY RESPECTS AND THUS
SUSCEPTIBLE TO INTERPRETATIONS AND PERIODIC REVISION BASED ON ACTUAL EXPERIENCE
AND BUSINESS DEVELOPMENTS. THE PROJECTIONS ALSO REFLECT NUMEROUS ASSUMPTIONS
(NOT ALL OF WHICH WERE PROVIDED TO HARRIS), ALL MADE BY MANAGEMENT OF THE
COMPANY, WITH RESPECT TO INDUSTRY PERFORMANCE, GENERAL BUSINESS, ECONOMIC,
MARKET AND FINANCIAL CONDITIONS AND OTHER MATTERS, INCLUDING EFFECTIVE TAX RATES
CONSISTENT WITH HISTORICAL LEVELS FOR THE COMPANY, ALL OF WHICH ARE DIFFICULT TO
PREDICT, MANY OF WHICH ARE BEYOND THE COMPANY'S CONTROL AND NONE OF WHICH WERE
SUBJECT TO APPROVAL BY THE OFFEROR OR HARRIS. ACCORDINGLY, WE CANNOT ASSURE YOU
THAT THE ASSUMPTIONS MADE IN PREPARING THE PROJECTIONS WILL PROVE ACCURATE, AND
ACTUAL RESULTS MAY BE MATERIALLY GREATER OR LESS THAN THOSE CONTAINED IN THE
PROJECTIONS. THE PROJECTIONS DO NOT GIVE EFFECT TO THE OFFER OR THE POTENTIAL
COMBINED OPERATIONS OF HARRIS AND THE COMPANY OR ANY CHANGES THAT MAY BE MADE TO
THE COMPANY'S OPERATIONS OR STRATEGY AFTER THE CONSUMMATION OF THE OFFER AND THE
MERGER. THE INCLUSION OF THE PROJECTIONS SHOULD NOT BE REGARDED AS AN INDICATION
THAT ANY OF THE OFFEROR, HARRIS OR THE COMPANY OR THEIR RESPECTIVE AFFILIATES OR
REPRESENTATIVES CONSIDERED OR CONSIDER THE PROJECTIONS TO BE A RELIABLE
PREDICTION OF FUTURE EVENTS, AND THE PROJECTIONS SHOULD NOT BE RELIED UPON AS
SUCH. NONE OF THE OFFEROR, HARRIS, THE COMPANY OR ANY OF THEIR RESPECTIVE
AFFILIATES OR REPRESENTATIVES ASSUMES ANY RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE VALIDITY,
REASONABLENESS, ACCURACY OR COMPLETENESS OF THE PROJECTIONS. NONE OF THE
OFFEROR, HARRIS OR THE COMPANY OR ANY OF THEIR RESPECTIVE AFFILIATES OR
REPRESENTATIVES HAS MADE, OR MAKES, ANY REPRESENTATION TO ANY PERSON REGARDING
THE INFORMATION CONTAINED IN THE PROJECTIONS AND NONE OF THEM INTENDS TO
PUBLICLY UPDATE OR OTHERWISE PUBLICLY REVISE THE PROJECTIONS TO REFLECT
CIRCUMSTANCES EXISTING AFTER THE DATE WHEN MADE OR TO REFLECT THE OCCURRENCE OF
FUTURE EVENTS EVEN IN THE EVENT THAT ANY OR ALL OF THE ASSUMPTIONS UNDERLYING
THE PROJECTIONS ARE SHOWN TO BE IN ERROR OR IF EXPERIENCE OR FUTURE CHANGES MAKE
IT CLEAR THAT THE PROJECTIONS WILL NOT BE REALIZED.

     Available Information. The Company is subject to the informational filing
requirements of the Exchange Act and, in accordance therewith, is obligated to
file periodic reports, proxy statements and other information with the
Commission relating to its business, financial condition and other matters. The

     Except for 1,200 Shares owned by Robert K. Henry, a Vice President of the
Offeror and the President of the Government Communications Systems Division of
Harris, all of which Shares were purchased by Mr. Henry more than sixty (60)
days prior to the date hereof, neither the Offeror nor Harris or, to the best
knowledge of the Offeror or Harris, any of the persons listed on Annex I to this
Offer to Purchase or any associate or majority-owned subsidiary of the Offeror
or Harris or any of the persons so listed, (i) beneficially owns or has any
right to acquire, directly or indirectly, any Shares, or (ii) has effected any
transaction in the Shares during the past sixty (60) days.

     Except as provided in the Merger Agreement and the Voting and Tender
Agreement, or as otherwise described in this Offer to Purchase, neither the
Offeror nor Harris or, to the best knowledge of the Offeror or Harris, any of
the persons listed on Annex I to this Offer to Purchase, has any contract,
arrangement, understanding or relationship with any other person with respect to
any securities of the Company, including any contract, arrangement,
understanding or relationship concerning the transfer or the voting of any such
securities, finder's fees, joint ventures, loan or option arrangements, puts or

the Offeror), or, to the best knowledge of the Offeror and Harris, any of the

Company or any of its affiliates, on the other hand, concerning a merger,

executive

officers, directors or affiliates that would require disclosure under the rules
and regulations of the Commission applicable to the Offer.

     During the past five (5) years, none of the Offeror, Harris or any of the
executive officers or directors listed on Annex I to this Offer to Purchase has
been (i) convicted in a criminal proceeding (excluding traffic violations or
similar misdemeanors), or (ii) a party to any judicial or administrative
proceeding (except for matters that were dismissed without sanction or
settlement) that resulted in a judgment, decree or final order enjoining the
person from future violations of, or prohibiting activities subject to, federal
or state securities laws, or a finding of any violation of federal or state
securities laws.

10. SOURCE AND AMOUNT OF FUNDS.

     The Offeror estimates that the total amount of funds required to (i)
purchase all of the Shares pursuant to the Offer, (ii) consummate the Merger,
and (iii) pay all fees and expenses related to the Offer and the Merger will be
approximately $25 million. Such amount assumes the purchase of all Shares
underlying options that were outstanding as of April 2, 2001 and that have an
exercise price of less than $3.55 per Share. See the "Introduction" and Section
17 of this Offer to Purchase. The Offeror will obtain such funds from Harris in
the form of capital contributions and/or advances. Harris currently anticipates
providing the funds necessary for such capital contributions and/or advances
from cash on hand. The Offer is not subject to a financing condition.

     While the foregoing represents the current intention of the Offeror and
Harris with respect to the financial arrangements for such funds, such financial
arrangements may change depending upon such factors as the Offeror and Harris
deem appropriate.

11. BACKGROUND OF THE OFFER; PAST CONTACTS, TRANSACTIONS, NEGOTIATIONS AND
AGREEMENTS WITH THE COMPANY.

     Past Transactions between Harris and the Company. Certain of Harris'
operations are conducted in the same industry segment as those of the Company.
In addition, the principal executive offices of each of Harris and the Company
are located in Melbourne, Florida, and certain of the Company's executives had
previously held executive positions with Harris. Accordingly, Harris has
generally been aware of the Company and its business activities for some time.

     On February 2, 2000, Exigent Software Technology, Inc., a Florida
corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, entered into a
services subcontract with Harris. The nature of this work is classified. On
August 4, 2000, Exigent Digital Telecom & Wireless Networks, Inc., a Delaware
corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, entered into a
subcontract with Harris whereby it agreed to provide JTRS integration support
and XML definition.

     Background of the Offer. In November 2000, the Company announced that its
Board of Directors had authorized the Company's management to explore strategic
alternatives, including the possible sale of all or a part of the Company's
assets, and that the Company had retained CIBC World Markets as its financial
advisor to assist the Company in these efforts.

     During November 2000, Harris was contacted to solicit Harris' interest in a
possible transaction with the Company. Harris was requested to submit a
preliminary indication of interest during the month of January 2001.

     In January 2001, Harris submitted a preliminary indication of interest
reflecting a total equity valuation for the Company of $16 million in cash. This
proposal was based solely on Harris' review of publicly available information.
As of January 26, Harris entered into a confidentiality agreement to enable
Harris access to non-public information of the Company, and Harris was provided
with a descriptive memorandum concerning the Company. The confidentiality
agreement contained customary standstill provisions with respect to acquisitions
by Harris of Company securities.

     During the week of February 5, 2001, Harris orally increased its
preliminary indication of interest to reflect a total equity valuation for the
Company of $22 million in cash.

     During February and March 2001, Harris commenced a broader due diligence of
the Company. During the week of February 26, 2001, the Company provided Harris
with access to detailed information concerning the Company at an off-site
location, and Harris attended Company management presentations regarding the
Company and its business operations.

     By letter dated March 19, 2001, Harris submitted a written bid to acquire
one hundred percent (100%) of the Company's fully-diluted capital stock for $22
million in cash.

     During negotiations conducted from March 21, 2001 through March 23, 2001,
Harris orally increased its offer to $23 million in cash.

     From March 23, 2001 until April 2, 2001, the parties, assisted by their
respective legal advisors, negotiated the terms of the definitive Merger
Agreement and discussed the open transaction terms to be negotiated.

     On April 2, 2001, the Board of Directors of Harris approved the transaction
and all further actions related thereto and authorized and approved certain
officers of Harris to negotiate and execute any documents or other instruments
required to complete the transaction.

     On April 2, 2001, the Board of Directors of the Company met and unanimously
voted to approve the Merger Agreement and the Voting and Tender Agreement.

     In the evening of April 2, 2001, the Company, Harris and the Offeror
executed the Merger Agreement, and Bernard R. Smedley, Harris and the Offeror
executed the Voting and Tender Agreement.

     On April 3, 2001, prior to the opening of financial markets, Harris and the
Company issued a joint press release announcing the transaction. On April 17,
2001, the Offeror commenced the Offer.

12. PURPOSE OF THE OFFER AND THE MERGER; PLANS FOR THE COMPANY; APPRAISAL
RIGHTS.

     The purpose of the Offer, the Merger, the Merger Agreement and the
Transactions is to enable Harris to acquire control of, and the entire equity
interest in, the Company. Through the Offer, the Offeror intends to acquire
control of, and a majority equity interest in, the Company. Following the
completion of the Offer, Harris intends to acquire any outstanding Shares not
owned by the Offeror by consummating the Merger. The Merger Agreement provides
for a merger of the Offeror with and into the Company, with the Company being
the surviving corporation.

     Under the DGCL, the approval of the Company's Board of Directors and,
unless the Merger is consummated pursuant to section 253 of the DGCL as
described below, the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the
outstanding shares of capital stock of the Company are required to approve and
adopt the Merger Agreement. The Company's Board of Directors has adopted
unanimously the Merger Agreement and the Transactions, and, unless the Merger is
consummated pursuant to the short form merger provisions under the DGCL as
described below (in which case no action by the Company's stockholders will be
required to consummate the Merger), the only remaining required corporate action
of the Company to consummate the Merger would be the approval and adoption of
the Merger Agreement by the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the
then outstanding shares of capital stock of the Company. If the Minimum
Condition is satisfied and the Offeror purchases the Shares tendered pursuant to
the Offer, the Offeror will have sufficient voting power to approve and adopt
the Merger Agreement without the affirmative vote of any other stockholder of
the Company.

     Short-Form Merger. Section 253 of the DGCL provides that, if a parent
corporation owns at least ninety percent (90%) of the outstanding shares of each
class of capital stock of a subsidiary corporation, the merger of the parent
corporation with the subsidiary corporation may be effected by having the board
of directors of the parent corporation approve and adopt a resolution or plan of
merger and by making the appropriate filings with the Delaware Secretary of
State, without any action or vote on the part of the subsidiary corporation's
stockholders. Accordingly, if the Offeror acquires, pursuant to the Offer or
otherwise, at least ninety percent (90%) of the outstanding Shares and ninety
percent (90%) of the outstanding shares of the Class A Preferred Stock, the
Offeror will be able to effect the Merger without a vote of the Company's
stockholders. However, if

the Offeror does not acquire at least ninety percent (90%) of the Shares and
ninety percent (90%) of the shares of Class A Preferred Stock pursuant to the
Offer or otherwise, a longer period of time may be required to effect the
Merger, because a vote of the Company's stockholders would be required under the
DGCL.

     Appraisal Rights. Stockholders do not have appraisal rights as a result of
the Offer. However, if the Merger is consummated, holders of Shares at the
Effective Time will have certain rights pursuant to the provisions of Section
262 of the DGCL to dissent from the Merger and demand appraisal of their Shares.
Under Section 262 of the DGCL, dissenting stockholders who comply with the
applicable statutory procedures will be entitled to receive a judicial
determination of the fair value of their Shares (exclusive of any element of
value arising from the accomplishment or expectation of the Merger) and to
receive payment of such fair value in cash, together with a fair rate of
interest, if any. Any such judicial determination of the fair value of Shares
could be based upon factors other than, or in addition to, the Offer Price or
the market value of the Shares. The value so determined could be more or less
than the Offer Price.

     THE FOREGOING SUMMARY OF SECTION 262 DOES NOT PURPORT TO BE COMPLETE AND IS
QUALIFIED IN ITS ENTIRETY BY REFERENCE TO SECTION 262. FAILURE TO FOLLOW THE
STEPS REQUIRED BY SECTION 262 OF THE DGCL FOR PERFECTING APPRAISAL RIGHTS MAY
RESULT IN THE LOSS OF SUCH RIGHTS.

     Rule 13e-3. The Commission has adopted Rule 13e-3 under the Exchange Act,
which is applicable to certain "going private" transactions and which may, under
certain circumstances, be applicable to the Merger or another business
combination in which the Offeror seeks to acquire the remaining Shares not held
by it following the purchase of Shares pursuant to the Offer. The Offeror
believes, however, that Rule 13e-3 will not be applicable to the Merger if the
Merger is consummated within one (1) year after the termination of the Offer at
the Offer Price. If applicable, Rule 13e-3 requires, among other things, that
certain financial information concerning the Company and certain information
relating to the fairness of the proposed transaction and the consideration
offered to minority stockholders in such transaction be filed with the
Commission and disclosed to stockholders prior to consummation of the
transaction.

     Plans for the Company. Harris will continue to evaluate the business and
operations of the Company during the pendency of the Offer and after the
consummation of the Offer and the Merger. Harris intends to seek additional
information about the Company during this period. Thereafter, Harris intends to
review such information as part of a comprehensive review of the Company's
assets, corporate structure, capitalization, business, operations, policies,
management and personnel with a view to optimizing the Company's potential
contribution to Harris' business. After such review, Harris will determine what
actions or changes, if any, would be desirable in light of the circumstances
that then exist, including steps to integrate the operations of the Surviving
Corporation and the operations of Harris.

     Except as indicated in this Offer to Purchase, Harris does not have any
current plans or proposals that relate to or would result in any of the
following: an extraordinary transaction, such as a merger, reorganization or
liquidation, involving the Company or any of the Subsidiaries; a sale or
transfer of a material amount of assets of the Company or any of the
Subsidiaries; any change in the present Board of Directors or management of the
Company; any material change in the present dividend rate or policy, or
indebtedness or capitalization of the Company; or any other material change in
the Company's corporate structure or business. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
promptly after the Offeror acquires the Shares pursuant to the Offer, the
Offeror will be entitled to designate such number of directors, rounded up to
the next whole number, on the Company's Board of Directors of the Company,
subject to compliance with Section 14(f) of the Exchange Act, as is equal to the
product of the total number of directors on the Company's Board of Directors
(giving effect to the directors designated by the Offeror) multiplied by the
percentage that the number of Shares beneficially owned by the Offeror or any
affiliate of the Offeror bears to the total number of Shares then outstanding.
The Company is obligated to take promptly all actions necessary to cause the
Offeror's designees to be elected as directors of the Company. In addition,
assuming the designation of directors as aforesaid and so long as there are
holders of Shares other than Harris or any of its subsidiaries, Harris expects
that the Company's Board of Directors would not declare dividends on the Shares.

     The Offeror and Harris intend to cause the Company to make an application
for termination of registration of the Shares as soon as possible after
consummation of the Offer if the Shares are then eligible for

such termination. In such event, following the consummation of the Merger, there
will be no publicly traded Shares outstanding. See Section 7 of this Offer to
Purchase.

13. THE MERGER AGREEMENT AND CERTAIN OTHER AGREEMENTS.

     The following summary of certain provisions of the Merger Agreement and the
Voting and Tender Agreement, copies of which are filed as exhibits to the
Schedule TO referred to in Section 18 of this Offer to Purchase, is qualified in
its entirety by reference to the text of such agreements. The following summary
may not contain all of the information that is important to you. The Merger
Agreement and the Voting and Tender Agreement may be examined and copies may be
obtained from the Commission in the same manner as set forth in Section 8 of
this Offer to Purchase.

  The Merger Agreement.

     The Offer. The Merger Agreement provides that the Offeror will commence the
Offer as promptly as reasonably practicable, but in any event within fifteen
(15) days, following the date of the Merger Agreement. Upon the terms and
subject to the prior satisfaction or waiver of the Offer Conditions, including
the Minimum Condition, the Offeror will purchase all Shares validly tendered
pursuant to the Offer. For a description of the Offer Conditions, see Section 15
of this Offer to Purchase. The Merger Agreement provides that the Offeror will
not amend or waive the Minimum Condition, decrease the Offer Price, decrease the
number of Shares sought in the Offer, impose any further conditions to the Offer
or amend any condition of the Offer in a manner materially adverse to the
holders of Shares without the consent of the Company. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, the Merger Agreement provides that the Offeror, without the consent
of the Company, may extend the Offer (i) for one (1) or more subsequent offering
periods of up to an additional twenty (20) business days in the aggregate if at
the scheduled or extended Expiration Date any of the conditions to the Offer
have not been satisfied or waived, (ii) for any period required by any rule,
regulation, interpretation or position of the Commission or the staff of the
Commission applicable to the Offer or any period required by applicable law, and
(iii) for one (1) or more subsequent offering periods of up to an additional
twenty (20) business days in the aggregate pursuant to Rule 14d-11 under the
Exchange Act. The Merger Agreement further provides, however, that in no event
may the Offer be extended beyond the date of termination of the Merger
Agreement, and either party has the right to terminate the Merger Agreement if
the Tender Offer Acceptance Date has not occurred on or before June 1, 2001, or
if the Effective Time has not occurred on or before December 31, 2001.

     The Merger. The Merger Agreement provides that as promptly as practicable
and in no event later than ninety (90) days after the consummation of the Offer
and subject to the terms and conditions thereof, in the event that the Offeror
acquires at least ninety percent (90%) of the outstanding Shares and ninety
percent (90%) of the outstanding shares of Class A Preferred Stock, the Offeror
shall be merged with and into the Company in accordance with Delaware law and,
as a result of the Merger, the separate corporate existence of the Offeror shall
cease and the Company shall continue as the surviving corporation (the
"Surviving Corporation"). In the event that the Offeror does not acquire at
least ninety percent (90%) of the Shares and ninety percent (90%) of the
outstanding shares of Class A Preferred Stock, the Company will duly call, give
notice of, convene and hold an annual or special meeting of its stockholders as
soon as practicable following the consummation of the Offer for the purpose of
considering and taking action on the Merger Agreement and the Merger.

     The respective obligations of the Offeror and Harris, on the one hand, and
the Company, on the other hand, to effect the Merger are subject to the
satisfaction of each of the following conditions: (i) the Merger Agreement shall
have been approved by the affirmative vote of the Company's stockholders, to the
extent required by applicable law, the Company's Certificate of Incorporation
and Bylaws, the Nasdaq SmallCap Market and The Chicago Stock Exchange; (ii) no
United States (federal, state or local) or foreign government, or governmental,
regulatory or administrative authority, agency or commission or court of
competent jurisdiction ("Governmental Authority") shall have enacted, issued,
promulgated, enforced or entered any law, order, executive order, stay, decree,
judgment, injunction or other order or statute, rule or regulation that is in
final effect and that has the effect of making the acquisition of Shares by the
Offeror or

Harris or any affiliate of either of them illegal or otherwise preventing or
prohibiting consummation of the Transactions; and (iii) the Offeror shall have
purchased all Shares validly tendered and not withdrawn pursuant to the Offer
sufficient to satisfy the Minimum Condition, unless any failure to purchase is a
result of a breach of the Offeror's obligation to purchase any Shares validly
tendered and not withdrawn pursuant to the Offer.

     At the Effective Time of the Merger, (i) each issued and outstanding Share
(other than Shares that are owned by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries,
Shares owned by Harris, the Offeror or any other wholly owned Subsidiary of
Harris, and Shares held by stockholders exercising appraisal rights under
Delaware law) and share of Class A Preferred Stock will be converted into the
right to receive an amount in cash equal to the Offer Price paid pursuant to the
Offer, without interest, and (ii) each issued and outstanding share of the
common stock, par value $.01 per share, of the Offeror will be converted into
one share of common stock, par value $.01 per share, of the Surviving
Corporation and shall constitute the only outstanding shares of capital stock of
the Surviving Corporation.

     The Company's Board of Directors. The Merger Agreement provides that
promptly upon the purchase by the Offeror of Shares pursuant to the Offer, the
Offeror shall be entitled to designate up to such number of directors, rounded
up to the next whole number, on the Company's Board of Directors as is equal to
the product of the total number of directors on the Company's Board of Directors
(giving effect to the directors designated by the Offeror) multiplied by the
percentage that the number of Shares beneficially owned by the Offeror or any
affiliate of the Offeror bears to the total number of Shares then outstanding.
The Company is obligated to take promptly all actions necessary to cause the
Offeror's designees to be elected as directors of the Company, including
increasing the size of the Company's Board of Directors or securing the
resignations of such number of its incumbent directors or both. At such time,
the Company also is required to cause persons designated by the Offeror to
constitute the same percentage as persons designated by the Offeror constitutes
of the Company's Board of Directors of (i) each committee of the Company's Board
of Directors, (ii) each board of directors of each domestic Subsidiary, and
(iii) each committee of each board of directors of each domestic Subsidiary, in
each case only to the extent permitted by applicable law.

     Stockholders' Meeting. If required by applicable law in order to consummate
the Merger, the Company, in accordance with applicable law and the Company's
Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws, has agreed to (a) duly call, give
notice of, convene and hold an annual or special meeting of its stockholders as
soon as practicable following consummation of the Offer for the purpose of
considering and taking action on the Merger Agreement and the Transactions, and
(b) subject to the fiduciary obligations of the Company's Board of Directors,
include in the Proxy Statement for such meeting the recommendation of the
Company's Board of Directors that the Company's stockholders approve the Merger
Agreement and the Transactions and use its reasonable best efforts to obtain
such approval. To the extent permitted by law, the Offeror and Harris each agree
to vote all Shares beneficially owned by them in favor of the Merger. If the
Offeror acquires at least fifty-one percent (51%) of the outstanding Shares, the
Offeror will have sufficient voting power to approve the Merger, even if no
other stockholder votes in favor of the Merger.

     The Merger Agreement provides that in the event that the Offeror and Harris
acquire in the aggregate at least ninety percent (90%) of the outstanding Shares
and at least ninety percent (90%) of the outstanding shares of Class A Preferred
Stock, pursuant to the Offer or otherwise, the Offeror, Harris and the Company
will, at the request of Harris, take all necessary and appropriate action to
cause the Merger to become effective as soon as practicable after such
acquisition, without a meeting of Company's stockholders, in accordance with
Delaware law.

     Proxy Statement. If required by applicable law in order to consummate the
Merger, as promptly as practicable after the purchase of all Shares validly
tendered and not withdrawn pursuant to the Offer, the Company shall file a Proxy
Statement with the Commission under the Exchange Act, and shall use its
reasonable best efforts to have the Proxy Statement cleared by the Commission.
The Company is required to give Harris and its counsel the opportunity to review
the Proxy Statement prior to its being filed with the Commission and to give
Harris and its counsel the opportunity to review all amendments and supplements
to

the Proxy Statement and all responses to requests for additional information and
replies to comments prior to their being filed with, or sent to, the Commission.

     Options. Immediately after the Effective Time, each outstanding option to

Incentive Stock Option Plan 1Q (Non-Qualified), (b) Incentive Stock Option Plan
2Q, (c) Incentive Stock Option Plan 3Q, (d) Incentive Stock Option Plan 4Q, (e)
Independent Directors Stock Option Plan (5Q), (f) Stock Option Plan 6NQ, and (g)
Exigent International, Inc. Omnibus Stock Option and Incentive Plan (such plans

that is then exercisable or vested, subject to the Company's receipt of any
required consent of the holders of such Options, shall be canceled by the
Company, and each holder of a canceled Option shall be entitled to receive from
the Offeror at the same time as payment for Shares is made by the Offeror in
connection with the Merger, in consideration for the cancellation of such
Option, an amount in cash equal to the product of (i) the number of Shares
previously subject to such Option, and (ii) the excess, if any, of the Offer
Price over the exercise price per Share previously subject to such Option. Each
Option that is not canceled as described above shall continue to have, and be
subject to, the same terms and conditions set forth in the applicable Company
Option Plan and agreement pursuant to which such Option was issued as in effect
immediately prior to the Effective Time, except that (i) each of the Shares for
which such Option is exercisable shall at the Effective Time be converted into
the right to receive an amount in cash equal to the Offer Price, and (ii) such
Option shall therefore be exercisable for an amount in cash equal to the product
of (x) the excess, if any, of the Offer Price over the per share exercise price

to such Option. Based on information supplied by the Company in its
Solicitation/Recommendation Statement on Schedule 14D-9, the Company's executive
officers and the members of its Board of Directors collectively will receive in
respect of Options to purchase Shares held by them an aggregate of approximately
$516,733, net of any exercise price paid by them.

Time, and the provisions in any other employee benefit plan, program or
arrangement of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries providing for the
issuance, transfer or grant of any capital stock of the Company or any interest
in respect of any capital stock of the Company will become inoperative as of the
Effective Time. The Company is required to ensure that, following the Effective
Time, no holder of an Option or any participant in any Company Option Plan or
other employee benefit plan, program or arrangement of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries shall have any right thereunder to acquire any capital stock of the
Company or the Surviving Corporation.

     Interim Operations; Covenants. Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, the
Company has agreed that, between the date of the Merger Agreement and the

accordance with past practice, or settle or compromise any pending or threatened
litigation which is material or which relates to the Transactions; (h) grant or
convey to any person any rights, including by way of sale, license or
sublicense, in any of the Company's intellectual property; (i) make any
significant change in any tax or accounting methods, principles or practices or
systems of internal accounting controls, except as may be appropriate to conform
to changes in tax laws or generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP"); (j)
after the date of the Merger Agreement, file any material tax return without the
prior consent of Harris, which consent will not be unreasonably withheld; (k)
(i) take any action that would make any representation and warranty of the
Company contained in the Merger Agreement inaccurate in any material respect at
the Expiration Date, including only extensions resulting from an Elective
Extension or a Required Extension (the "MC Offer Expiration Date"), or (ii) omit
to take any commercially reasonable course of action necessary to prevent any
such representation or warranty from being inaccurate in any material respect at
such time; or (l) agree to commit to do any of the foregoing.

     Access to Information; Confidentiality. Pursuant to the Merger Agreement
and subject to a customary confidentiality agreement entered into by Harris
dated January 26, 2001 (the "Confidentiality Agreement"), from the date of the
Merger Agreement to the election or appointment of the Offeror's designees to
the Company's Board of Directors upon the purchase by the Offeror of Shares
pursuant to the Offer, the Company will provide Harris, during normal business
hours and upon reasonable notice, access to all financial, operating and other
data and information regarding the business of the Company as Harris reasonably
requests, other than information and documents that in the opinion of the
Company's counsel may not be disclosed under applicable law.

     No Solicitation. Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, the Company has agreed
that neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries will, directly or
indirectly, through any officer, director, employee, agent or otherwise,
solicit, initiate or encourage the submission of any proposal or offer from any
person relating to any acquisition or purchase of all or any material portion of
the assets of, or any equity interest in, the Company or any Subsidiary or any
merger, consolidation, share exchange, business combination or other similar

transaction with the Company or any Subsidiary (a "Business Combination
Proposal") or participate in any negotiations regarding, or furnish or make
available to any other person any information with respect to, or otherwise
cooperate in any way with, or assist or participate in, facilitate or encourage,
any effort or attempt by any other person to do or seek or provide access to the
properties, books or records of the Company or any Subsidiary to any person in
connection with, any of the foregoing; provided, however, that the foregoing
shall not prohibit the Company from complying with the applicable provisions of
the Exchange Act or furnishing information to, or entering into discussions or
negotiations with or providing access to the properties, books or records of the
Company or any Subsidiary to any person in connection with an unsolicited
Business Combination Proposal by such person received by the Company after the
date of the Merger Agreement, if, and only to the extent that (a) a majority of
the disinterested members of the Company's Board of Directors, after
consultation with the Company's independent financial advisor and based on the
advice of outside counsel, determines in good faith that such action is required
in order for the Company's Board of Directors not to breach its fiduciary duties
to stockholders imposed by law, and (b) prior to furnishing such information to,
or entering into discussions or negotiations with, such person, the Company (i)
gives Harris as promptly as practicable prior written notice of the Company's
intention to furnish such information or begin such discussions, the identity of
such person and the material terms of such Business Combination Proposal, and
(ii) receives from such person an executed confidentiality agreement on terms no
less favorable to the Company than those contained in the Confidentiality
Agreement.

     The Company also has agreed, pursuant to the Merger Agreement, that neither
the Company's Board of Directors nor any committee thereof shall (i) withdraw or
modify, or propose to withdraw or modify, in a manner adverse to the Offeror or
Harris, the approval or recommendation by such Board of Directors or any such
committee of the Offer, the Merger Agreement or the Merger, or (ii) approve or
recommend, or propose to approve or recommend, any Business Combination
Proposal. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company's Board of Directors, to
the extent required by the fiduciary obligations thereof, as determined in good
faith by a majority of the disinterested members thereof based on the advice of
outside counsel, may approve or recommend (and, in connection therewith,
withdraw or modify its approval or recommendation of the Offer, the Merger
Agreement and the Merger) a Superior Proposal. "Superior Proposal" means a bona
fide Business Combination Proposal made by a third party to acquire, directly or
indirectly, more than fifty percent (50%) of the Shares then outstanding or all
or a material portion of the assets of the Company and the Subsidiaries, and
otherwise on terms that a majority of the disinterested members of the Company's
Board of Directors determines in its good faith judgment (after consultation
with the Company's independent financial advisor) to be more favorable to the
holders of Shares than the Offer and the Merger from a financial perspective and
for which financing, to the extent required, is then committed or which, in the
good faith judgment of a majority of such disinterested members (after
consultation with the Company's independent financial advisor), is reasonably
likely to be financed by such third party.

     Indemnification and Insurance. Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, the
Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation shall
contain provisions no less favorable with respect to indemnification than are
set forth in the Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws of the Company, which
provisions shall not be amended, repealed or otherwise modified for a period of
six (6) years from the Effective Time in any manner that would affect adversely
the rights thereunder of individuals who at any time prior to the Effective Time
were directors, officers or employees of the Company or any of the Subsidiaries,
unless such modification shall be required by Delaware law. In addition, from
and after the Effective Time, Harris and the Surviving Corporation shall
indemnify, defend and hold harmless each person who is now, or has been at any
time prior to the date of the Merger Agreement or who becomes prior to the
Effective Time, an officer, director, employee or agent of the Company or any of
the Subsidiaries (collectively, the "Indemnified Parties") against all losses,
expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees), claims, damages, liabilities or
amounts that are paid in settlement of, with the approval of the Surviving
Corporation (which approval shall not unreasonably be withheld), or otherwise in
connection with, any threatened or actual claim, action, suit, proceeding or
investigation (a "Claim"), based in whole or in part on or arising in whole or
in part out of the fact that the Indemnified Party (or the person controlled by
the Indemnified Party) is or was a director, officer, employee or agent of the
Company or any of the Subsidiaries and pertaining to any matter existing or
arising out of actions or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time
(including any Claim arising out of the Merger

Agreement or any of the Transactions), whether asserted or claimed prior to, at
or after the Effective Time, in each case to the fullest extent permitted under
Delaware law and by the Company's Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws as in
effect on the date of the Merger Agreement, and shall pay any expenses, as
incurred, in advance of the disposition of any such action or proceeding to each
Indemnified Party to the fullest extent permitted under Delaware law and by the
Company's Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws as in effect on the date of
the Merger Agreement.

     Harris also has agreed, pursuant to the Merger Agreement, to maintain in
effect for three (3) years from the Effective Time, if available, the current
directors' and officers' liability insurance policies maintained by the Company
(provided that Harris may substitute therefor policies of at least the same
coverage containing terms and conditions that are not materially less favorable)
with respect to matters occurring prior to the Effective Time; provided,
however, that in the event that the annual premium for such coverage is more
than two (2) times the annual premium for such coverage as of the date of the
Merger Agreement, Harris shall be obligated only to maintain the best coverage
that reasonably can be obtained for an annual premium equal to two (2) times the
annual premium in effect as of the date of the Merger Agreement; provided,
further, that in no event shall the policy limits of such coverage be less than
two-thirds ( 2/3) of the policy limits in effect on the date of the Merger
Agreement.

     Employee Benefits. Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, the Company is
required to terminate the Exigent International, Inc. Employee 401(K) Profit
Sharing and Employee Stock Ownership Plan and the Exigent International, Inc.
Money Purchase Pension Plan and Trust prior to the Effective Time. The Company
also was required to, and did, suspend purchases and contributions under the
Exigent International, Inc. Employee Stock Purchase Plan, effective as of April
1, 2001 through the Effective Time.

     The Merger Agreement also provides that, following the Offeror Election
Date, Harris is required to cause the Company (and, after the Merger, the
Surviving Corporation) and each of the Subsidiaries to honor all accrued benefit
obligations to current and former employees and directors under the Company's or
such Subsidiaries' employee benefit plans and fringe benefit plans in existence
on the date of the Merger Agreement and all employment or severance agreements
entered into by the Company or any of the Subsidiaries or adopted by the
Company's Board of Directors prior to the date of the Merger Agreement;
provided, however, that nothing shall prevent Harris or the Company (and, after
the Merger, the Surviving Corporation) from taking any action with respect to
such plans, obligations or agreements or refraining from taking any such action
which is permitted or provided for under the terms thereof or under applicable
law.

     The Merger Agreement further provides that, among other things, employees
of the Company and the Subsidiaries will be eligible to participate in Harris'
employee benefit plans and programs as of the Effective Time in accordance with
the terms and conditions of such plans and programs as applicable to similarly
situated employees of Harris or its subsidiaries, as the case may be, and
applicable law. Employees of the Company and the Subsidiaries (and, after the
Merger, the Surviving Corporation) will be given credit for their length of
service with the Company and any Subsidiaries under all employee benefit plans,
programs and policies of the Surviving Corporation or Harris in which they are
eligible to participate or become participants for all purposes thereunder,
except to the extent that such crediting would produce a duplication of benefits
or violate any provision of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974,
as amended, or the Code. Harris is required to provide and recognize all accrued
but unused vacation and sick days of employees of the Company and the
Subsidiaries as of the Effective Time.

     Amendment to the Rights Agreement. The Company represented and warranted to
the Offeror and Harris in the Merger Agreement that (i) the Company's Board of
Directors has taken all necessary action (including any amendment thereof) under
the Rights Agreement (without redeeming the Rights) so that none of the
execution or delivery of the Merger Agreement, the making or consummation of the
Offer (including the acquisition of Shares pursuant to the Offer), the
consummation of the Voting and Tender Agreement or the consummation of any of
the Transactions will cause (a) the Rights to become exercisable under the
Rights Agreement or to separate from the stock certificates to which they are
attached, (b) an "Acquisition Date" under the Rights Agreement to occur, or (c)
the Offeror, Harris or any of their affiliates to

be deemed an "Acquiring Person" under the Rights Agreement; and (ii) the Rights
Agreement, as so amended, has not been further amended or modified.

     Representations and Warranties. Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, the
Company also made other customary representations and warranties to the Offeror
and Harris with respect to, among other things, its organization;
capitalization; corporate authority; no conflict; required filings and consents;
financial statements; public filings; conduct of business; employee benefit
plans; intellectual property; labor matters; compliance with laws; tax matters;
litigation; environmental matters; tangible property; opinion of the Company's
financial advisor; brokers; material contracts; undisclosed liabilities; and the
absence of any Material Adverse Effect since December 31, 2000. For purposes of
the Merger Agreement and this Offer to Purchase, "Material Adverse Effect"
means, with respect to any person, any event, change or effect, individually or
together with any other event, change or effect, that is or is reasonably likely
to be materially adverse (i) to the financial condition, business or results of
operations of such person, taken as a whole, or (ii) the ability of the Company
to perform its obligations under the Merger Agreement or to consummate any of
the Transactions. The following, however, shall not be deemed in themselves,
either alone or in combination, to constitute, a Material Adverse Effect: (i)
any change in the market price or trading volume of the Shares after the date of
the Merger Agreement; (ii) any adverse change, effect, event, occurrence, state
of facts or developments attributable to or caused by the deterioration in
performance of Harris or its affiliates in its capacity as a customer or
supplier of the Company; (iii) any adverse change, effect, event, occurrence,
state of facts or developments directly caused by the announcement or pendency
of the Offer or the Merger (including any cancellations of or delays in customer
orders, any reduction in sales, any disruption in supplier, distributor, partner
or similar relationships or any loss of employees); (iv) any adverse change,
effect, event, occurrence state of facts or developments directly caused by,
resulting from, or attributable to conditions affecting the technology and space
industries as a whole or the United States or world economies as a whole, and
not having a materially disproportionate effect on the Company; (v) any adverse
change, effect, event, occurrence state of facts or developments resulting from
or attributable or relating to out-of-pocket fees and expenses (including legal,
accounting, investment banking and other fees and expenses) incurred in
connection with the Transactions; or (vi) any adverse change, effect, event,
occurrence state of facts or developments directly caused by compliance with the
terms of, or the taking of any action required by, the Merger Agreement; and
provided further, that with respect to any dispute regarding whether any adverse
change, effect, event, occurrence state of facts or developments is "directly
caused" by any of the foregoing, the Offeror and Harris have the burden of proof
by a preponderance of the evidence.

     Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, the Offeror and Harris have made
customary representations and warranties to the Company with respect to, among
other things, their organization; corporate authority; no conflict; required
filings and consents; brokers; and financial resources.

     Termination; Fees. The Merger Agreement may be terminated and the Offer,
the Merger and the other Transactions may be abandoned at any time prior to the
Tender Offer Acceptance Date, as follows:

          (a) by mutual written consent duly authorized by the boards of
     directors of each of the Offeror, Harris and the Company prior to the
     Tender Offer Acceptance Date;

          (b) by either Harris or the Company if the Tender Offer Acceptance
     Date shall not have occurred on or before June 1, 2001 or the Effective
     Time shall not have occurred on or before December 31, 2001; provided,
     however, that the right to terminate the Merger Agreement pursuant to this
     provision shall not be available to any party whose failure to fulfill any
     obligation under the Merger Agreement has been the cause of, or resulted
     in, the failure of the Tender Offer Acceptance Date or the Effective Time
     to occur on or before such date;

          (c) by Harris if: (i) due to an occurrence or circumstance that
     results in a failure to satisfy any Offer Condition, the Offeror shall have
     (A) terminated the Offer without having accepted any Shares for payment
     thereunder, or (B) failed to pay for Shares pursuant to the Offer within
     ninety (90) days following the commencement of the Offer, unless any such
     termination or failure listed above shall have been caused by or resulted
     from the failure of the Offeror or Harris to perform in any material
     respect any covenant or agreement of either of them contained in the Merger
     Agreement or the material breach by

     the Offeror or Harris of any representation or warranty of either of them
     contained in the Merger Agreement; or (ii) prior to the purchase of Shares
     pursuant to the Offer, (A) the Company's Board of Directors shall have
     failed to recommend or withdraws its approval or recommendation of the
     Merger Agreement, the Merger or the Offer or shall have resolved to do so,
     (B) the Company's Board of Directors shall have recommended to the
     Company's stockholders, or entered into, or publicly announced its
     intention to consummate, an agreement or agreement in principle with
     respect to any Superior Proposal or resolved to do so, (C) a cash tender
     offer or exchange offer for fifty percent (50%) or more of the outstanding
     shares of capital stock of the Company is commenced (other than by Harris
     or its affiliates) and the Company's Board of Directors fails to recommend
     against the Company's stockholders tendering their shares into such tender
     offer or exchange offer, (D) the Company shall have breached any of its
     obligations with respect to the solicitation of Business Combination
     Proposals (see the paragraph entitled "No Solicitation" in Section 13 of
     this Offer to Purchase), (E) the Company's Board of Directors shall exempt
     any other person from the provisions of Section 203 of the DGCL or Section
     607.0902 of the Florida Business Corporation Act, or (F) any person shall
     have become an "Acquiring Person" under the Rights Agreement, or the
     Company's Board of Directors shall have taken action excluding a person
     from becoming an "Acquiring Person" who, in the absence of such Board
     action, would otherwise be an "Acquiring Person" under the Rights
     Agreement; or

          (d) by the Company if: (i) the Offeror shall have (A) failed to
     commence the Offer within fifteen (15) days following the date of the
     Merger Agreement, (B) terminated the Offer without having accepted any
     Shares for payment thereunder, or (C) failed to pay for Shares pursuant to
     the terms of the Offer or as required under the DGCL, unless such failure
     or termination listed above shall have been caused by or resulted from the
     failure of the Company or the Tendering Stockholder to perform in any
     material respect any covenant or agreement contained in the Merger
     Agreement or the Voting and Tender Agreement, respectively, or the material
     breach by the Company or the Tendering Stockholder of any representation or
     warranty contained in the Merger Agreement or the Voting and Tender
     Agreement, respectively; or (ii) the Company's Board of Directors shall
     approve, and the Company shall enter into, a definitive agreement providing
     for the implementation of a Superior Proposal.

     The above-referenced termination provisions are sometimes referred to,
collectively, or individually, as the "Termination Rights."

     Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, the Company is required to pay Harris the
Harris Expenses (defined below) and the Termination Fee (defined below) if the
Merger Agreement is terminated pursuant to paragraph (c)(ii) or (d)(ii) of the
Termination Rights; provided, however, that in the event the Merger Agreement is
terminated pursuant to clauses (B), (C), (E) or (F) of paragraph (c)(ii) or
pursuant to paragraph (d)(ii) of the Termination Rights, the Termination Fee
shall not be payable unless the Superior Proposal, tender offer or other
transaction giving rise to the termination is consummated. In addition, in the
event that after the date of the Merger Agreement a Business Combination
Proposal shall have been made to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or
stockholders or any person shall have announced an intention (whether or not
conditional) to make a Business Combination Proposal and thereafter the Merger
Agreement is terminated pursuant to paragraph (c)(i) or paragraph (d)(i) of the
Termination Rights as a result of the Minimum Condition not being satisfied and
within twelve (12) months of such termination such person acquires, directly or
indirectly, more than fifty percent (50%) of the Shares then outstanding or all
or a material portion of the assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries, then
the Company shall pay Harris an amount equal to the Termination Fee, less any
amounts, if any, paid pursuant to the immediately preceding sentence. Any
amounts payable pursuant to the immediately preceding sentence are payable upon
the consummation of the transaction or the occurrence of the event giving rise
to such obligation.

     For purposes of the Merger Agreement and this Offer to Purchase,
"Termination Fee" means a fee equal to $690,000, less any previously paid Harris
Expenses, and "Harris Expenses" means the documented out-of-pocket fees and
expenses reasonably incurred and paid by or on behalf of Harris in connection
with the Merger Agreement, the Offer, the Merger, the Voting and Tender
Agreement or the consummation of any of the transactions contemplated thereby,
including all governmental filing fees and fees and expenses of counsel,

commercial banks, printers, paying agents, dealer managers, accountants, experts
and consultants up to a maximum amount of $400,000.

     Except as described in this Section 13, all costs and expenses incurred in
connection with the Merger Agreement and the Transactions shall be paid by the
party incurring such expenses, whether or not any Transaction is consummated.

     Amendment. The Merger Agreement may be amended by the Company's, the
Offeror's and Harris' respective Boards of Directors at any time prior to the
Effective Time; provided, however, that after the Merger Agreement and the
Transactions are approved by the Company's stockholders, if necessary, the
Merger Agreement may not be amended if such amendment would violate the DGCL.
The Merger Agreement may not be amended except by an instrument in writing
signed by the Company, the Offeror and Harris.

  The Voting and Tender Agreement.

     Pursuant to the Voting and Tender Agreement, the Tendering Stockholder has
agreed that, (a) he shall vote the Shares held by him in favor of the Merger and
the Merger Agreement; (b) he shall vote his Shares against (i) any merger
agreement or merger (other than the Merger Agreement and the Merger),
consolidation, combination, sale of substantial assets, reorganization,
recapitalization, dissolution, liquidation or winding up of or by the Company or
any other Business Combination Proposal, or (ii) any amendment of the Company's
Certificate of Incorporation or Bylaws or other proposal or transaction
involving the Company or any of its affiliates, which amendment or other
proposal or transaction would in any manner impede, frustrate, prevent or
nullify the Merger Agreement, the Merger or any of the other Transactions; (c)
he shall not (i) sell, transfer, pledge, assign or otherwise dispose of, or
enter into any contract, option or other arrangement (including any profit
sharing arrangement) with respect to the sale, transfer, pledge, assignment or
other disposition of, his Shares to any person other than the Offeror or the
Offeror's designee, or (ii) enter into any voting arrangement, whether by proxy,
voting agreement or otherwise, in connection, directly or indirectly, with any
Business Combination Proposal; and (d) so long as the Merger Agreement has not
been terminated and the Offer is not amended in a manner prohibited by the
Merger Agreement, he shall tender pursuant to the Offer, and not withdraw any of
the Shares owned by him.

     The Voting and Tender Agreement terminates upon the earlier of (i) the
Effective Time, (ii) the termination of the Merger Agreement (see the paragraph
entitled "Termination; Fees" above); provided, however, that the Voting and
Tender Agreement will not terminate until ninety (90) days after a termination
pursuant to clause (ii) above if (A) the Merger Agreement is terminated by
Harris or the Offeror pursuant to paragraph (c) of the Termination Rights
because of the withdrawal or modification in the approval or recommendation, by
the Company's Board of Directors or any committee thereof, of the Offer, the
Merger and the Merger Agreement, as provided in paragraph (d) of Section 15 of
this Offer to Purchase, or because the Company's Board of Directors or any

the time of such withdrawal or modification, or the adoption of such resolution,
a Superior Proposal shall have been made, (B) the Merger Agreement has been

Directors or any committee thereof has adopted a resolution to effect such
approval or recommendation, as provided in paragraph (d) of Section 15 of this
Offer to Purchase, or (C) the Merger Agreement is terminated by the Company
pursuant to paragraph (d)(ii) of the Termination Rights, (iii) the Merger
Agreement is amended in a manner adverse to the Tendering Stockholder without
his consent, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed, or
(iv) the failure of the Offeror to make the Offer in accordance with the Merger
or the failure of the Offeror to comply with the terms of the Offer.

  The Confidentiality Agreement.

     Pursuant to the Confidentiality Agreement, Harris agreed to keep
confidential certain information regarding the Company. The Confidentiality
Agreement also contains customary non-solicitation and standstill provisions.

14. DIVIDENDS AND DISTRIBUTIONS.

     As described above, the Merger Agreement provides that, prior to the
Offeror Election Date, the Company will not, and will not permit any Subsidiary
to, (a) issue, sell, pledge, dispose of, grant, encumber or authorize the
issuance, sale, pledge, disposition, grant or encumbrance of, (i) any shares of
capital stock of the Company or any Subsidiary of any class, or any options,
warrants, convertible securities or other rights of any kind of acquire any

issuable under agreements in effect on the date of the Merger Agreement and
shares of capital stock issuable pursuant to Options or employee benefit plans
in effect on the date of the Merger Agreement), or (ii) any of the Company's or
any Subsidiary's assets, except for sales in the ordinary course of business and

otherwise acquire, directly or indirectly, any of its capital stock.

15. CERTAIN CONDITIONS TO THE OFFEROR'S OBLIGATIONS.

     at the time of the commencement of the Offer, a material acceleration or
     worsening thereof;

          (f) the Company shall have failed to perform or comply in any material
     respects with all agreements and covenants required by the Merger Agreement
     to be performed or complied with by it at, or any of the representations
     and warranties of the Company contained in the Merger Agreement that are
     qualified as to materiality shall fail to be true and correct, or any such
     representations and warranties that are not so qualified shall fail to be
     true and correct in all material respects, each as of the MC Offer
     Expiration Date as though made on and as of such date, except that those
     representations and warranties which address matters only as of a
     particular date shall remain true and correct, or true and correct in all
     material aspects, as the case may be, as of such date;

          (g) the Merger Agreement shall have been terminated in accordance with
     its terms;

          (h) the Offeror and the Company shall have agreed that the Offeror
     shall terminate the Offer or postpone the acceptance for payment of or
     payment for Shares thereunder; or

          (i) all consents of and notices to or filings with Governmental
     Authorities (including specifically those applicable to defense industry
     contractors) and third parties required to be obtained prior to the MC
     Offer Expiration Date under the Merger Agreement shall not have been
     obtained or made, other than those the absence of which, individually or in
     the aggregate, would not have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company or
     prevent or materially delay consummation of any of the Transactions.

     The foregoing conditions are for the sole benefit of the Offeror and
Harris, and may be asserted by the Offeror or Harris regardless of the
circumstances giving rise to any such condition or may be waived by the Offeror
or Harris in whole or in part at any time and from time to time in their sole
discretion. The failure by the Offeror or Harris at any time to exercise any of
the foregoing rights shall not be deemed a waiver of any such right; the waiver
of any such right with respect to particular facts and other circumstances shall
not be deemed a waiver with respect to any other facts and circumstances; and
each such right shall be deemed an ongoing right that may be asserted at any
time and from time to time.

16. CERTAIN LEGAL MATTERS.

     Except as described in this Section 16, based on a review of publicly
available filings by the Company with the Commission and other publicly
available information concerning the Company, the Offeror is not aware of any
approval or other action by any governmental or administrative agency that would
be required for the acquisition or ownership of Shares by the Offeror as
contemplated herein. Should any such approval or other action be required, it
will be sought, but the Offeror has no current intention to delay the purchase
of

Shares tendered pursuant to the Offer pending the outcome of any such matter,
subject, however, to the Offeror's right to decline to purchase Shares if any of
the conditions specified in Section 15 of this Offer to Purchase shall have
occurred. There can be no assurance that any such approval or other action, if
needed, would be obtained or would be obtained without substantial conditions,
or that adverse consequences might not result to the Company's business or that
certain parts of the Company's business might not have to be disposed of if any
such approvals were not obtained or other action taken.

     U.S. Antitrust. The Offeror is not aware of any approval or other action by
any governmental or administrative agency that would be required for the
acquisition or ownership of Shares by the Offeror as contemplated herein under
the provisions of the HSR Act.

     Section 203 of the DGCL. The Company is incorporated under the laws of the
State of Delaware. As a Delaware corporation, the Company is subject to Section
203 of the DGCL. In general, Section 203 would prevent an "interested
stockholder" (generally defined as a person beneficially owning fifteen percent
(15%) or more of a corporation's voting stock) from engaging in a "business
combination" (defined to include mergers and certain other actions with a
Delaware corporation) for three (3) years following the date such person became
an interested stockholder unless: (1) before such person became an interested
stockholder, the board of directors of the corporation approved the transaction
in which the interested stockholder became an interested stockholder or approved
the business combination, (2) upon consummation of the transaction that resulted
in the interested stockholder becoming an interested stockholder, the interested
stockholder owned at least eighty-five percent (85%) of the voting stock of the
corporation outstanding at the time the transaction commenced (excluding for
purposes of determining the number of shares of outstanding stock held by
directors who are also officers and by employee stock plans that do not allow
plan participants to determine confidentially whether to tender shares), or (3)
following the transaction in which such person became an interested stockholder,
the business combination is (x) approved by the board of directors of the
corporation, and (y) authorized at a meeting of the stockholders by the
affirmative vote of the holders of a least sixty-six and two-thirds percent
(66 2/3%) of the outstanding voting stock of the corporation not owned by the
interested stockholder. In accordance with the provisions of Section 203, the
Company's Board of Directors unanimously has approved the Merger Agreement and,
therefore, the restrictions of Section 203 are inapplicable to the Offer, the
Merger and the other Transactions.

     Florida Control Share Acquisitions. The Company also is subject to Section
607.0902 of the Florida Business Corporation Act (the "Florida Control Share
Acquisition Statute"). The Florida Control Share Acquisition Statute applies to
publicly held corporations, such as the Company, that have a sufficient presence
in Florida and provides that shares of such corporations that are acquired in a
"control share acquisition" generally will have no voting rights unless such
rights are conferred on those shares by the vote of the holders of a majority of
all the outstanding shares other than interested shares. A "control share
acquisition" is defined, with certain exceptions, as the acquisition of the
ownership of voting shares that would cause the acquiror to have voting power
within the following ranges or to move upward from one range into another: (i)
twenty percent (20%), but less than thirty-three and one-third percent
(33 1/3%); (ii) thirty-three and one-third percent (33 1/3%), but less than
fifty percent (50%); or (iii) fifty percent (50%) or more of such votes. The
Florida Control Share Acquisition Statute does not apply to an acquisition of
shares if such acquisition has been approved by the board of directors of that
corporation before the acquisition. In accordance with the provisions of the
Florida Control Share Acquisition Statute, the Company's Board of Directors
unanimously has approved the Merger Agreement and, therefore, the restrictions
of the Florida Control Share Acquisition Statute are inapplicable to the Offer,
the Merger and the other Transactions.

     Other State Takeover Laws. The Company and certain of its Subsidiaries
conduct business in a number of other states throughout the United States, some
of which have adopted laws and regulations applicable to offers to acquire
shares of corporations that are incorporated or have substantial assets,
stockholders and/or a principal place of business in such states. In Edgar v.
Mite Corp., the Supreme court of the United States held that the Illinois
Business Takeover Statute, which involved state securities laws that made the
takeover of certain corporations more difficult, imposed a substantial burden on
interstate commerce and was therefore unconstitutional. In CTS Corp. v. Dynamics
Corp. of America, however, the Supreme Court of the United States held that a
state may, as a matter of corporate law and, in particular, those laws
concerning corporate

governance, constitutionally disqualify a potential acquiror from voting on the
affairs of a target corporation without prior approval of the remaining
stockholders, provided that such laws were applicable only under certain
conditions, in particular, that the corporation has a substantial number of
stockholders in and is incorporated under the laws of such state. Subsequently,
in TLX Acquisition Corp. v. Telex Corp., a federal district court in Oklahoma
ruled that certain Oklahoma statutes were unconstitutional insofar as they
applied to corporations incorporated outside Oklahoma in that they would subject
such corporations to inconsistent regulations. Similarly, in Tyson Foods, Inc.
v. McReynolds, a federal district court in Tennessee ruled that four (4)
Tennessee takeover statutes were unconstitutional as applied to corporations
incorporated outside Tennessee. This decision was affirmed by the United States
Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit.

     Except as otherwise discussed in this Offer to Purchase, neither the
Offeror nor Harris has determined whether any other state takeover laws and
regulations will by their terms apply to the Transactions, and, except as set
forth above, neither the Offeror nor Harris presently has sought to comply with
any state takeover statute or regulations. The Offeror and Harris reserve the
right to challenge the applicability or validity of any state law or regulation
purporting to apply to the Transactions, and neither anything in this Offer to
Purchase nor any action taken in connection herewith is intended as a waiver of
such right. In the event it is asserted that one (1) or more state takeover laws
is applicable to the Transactions and an appropriate court does not determine
that such law(s) is inapplicable or invalid as applied to the Transactions, the
Offeror and/or Harris might be required to file certain information with, or to
receive approval from, the relevant state authorities. In addition, if enjoined,
the Offeror might be unable to accept for payment or pay for Shares tendered
pursuant to the Offer, or be delayed in continuing or consummating the
Transactions. In such event, the Offeror may not be obligated to accept for
payment any Shares tendered. See Section 15 of this Offer to Purchase.

17. FEES AND EXPENSES.

     Neither the Offeror nor Harris, nor any officer, director, stockholder,
agent or other representative of the Offeror or Harris, will pay any fees or
commissions to any broker, dealer or other person (other than the Information
Agent and the Dealer Manager) for soliciting tenders of Shares pursuant to or
making recommendations in connection with the Offer. Brokers, dealers,
commercial banks and trust companies and other nominees will, upon request, be
reimbursed by the Offeror for customary mailing and handling expenses incurred
by them in forwarding materials to their customers.

     Georgeson Shareholder Securities Corporation ("Georgeson Securities") is
acting as Dealer Manager in connection with the Offer. Harris has agreed to pay
Georgeson Securities reasonable compensation for such services. In addition,
Harris has agreed to reimburse Georgeson Securities for its reasonable
out-of-pocket expenses related to its engagement and has agreed to indemnify
Georgeson Securities against certain liabilities in connection with the Offer.

     The Offeror has retained Georgeson Shareholder Communications Inc. as
Information Agent and Mellon Investor Services, L.L.C. as Depositary in
connection with the Offer. The Information Agent and the Depositary will receive
reasonable and customary compensation for their services hereunder and
reimbursement for their reasonable out-of-pocket expenses. The Information Agent
and the Depositary also will be indemnified by the Offeror against certain
liabilities in connection with the Offer. The Information Agent may contact
holders of Shares by mail, e-mail, telex, telegraph and personal interviews and
may request brokers, dealers and other nominee holders of Shares to forward
materials relating to the Offer to beneficial owners of Shares.

18. MISCELLANEOUS.

     The Offer is not being made to, nor will tenders be accepted from or on
behalf of, holders of Shares residing in any jurisdiction in which the making or
acceptance thereof would not be in compliance with the laws of such
jurisdiction. However, the Offeror, in its sole and absolute discretion, may
take such action as it may deem necessary to enable it to make the Offer in any
such jurisdiction and extend the Offer to holders of Shares in such
jurisdiction.

     NO PERSON HAS BEEN AUTHORIZED TO GIVE ANY INFORMATION OR MAKE ANY
REPRESENTATION ON BEHALF OF THE OFFEROR OTHER THAN AS CONTAINED IN THIS OFFER TO
PURCHASE OR IN THE LETTER OF TRANSMITTAL AND, IF ANY SUCH INFORMATION OR
REPRESENTATION IS GIVEN OR MADE, IT SHOULD NOT BE RELIED UPON AS HAVING BEEN
AUTHORIZED BY THE OFFEROR OR HARRIS.

     The Offeror and Harris have filed with the Commission the Schedule TO,
pursuant to Section 14(d)(1) of the Exchange Act and Rule 14d-3 promulgated
thereunder, furnishing certain information with respect to the Offer. The
Schedule TO and any amendments thereto, including exhibits, may be examined and
copies may be obtained at the same places and in the same manner as set forth
with respect to the Company in Section 8 of this Offer to Purchase (except that
they will not be available at the regional offices of the Commission).

Ladies and Gentlemen:

     The undersigned hereby tenders to Manatee Merger Corp. (the "Offeror"), a
Delaware corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of Harris Corporation, a
Delaware corporation ("Harris"), the above-described shares of Common Stock
(including the associated Series B Junior Participating Preferred Stock Purchase
Rights), par value $0.01 per share (the "Shares"), of Exigent International,
Inc., a Delaware corporation (the "Company"), pursuant to the Offeror's offer to
purchase all of the outstanding Shares at a purchase price of $3.55 per Share,
net to the seller in cash, without interest, upon the terms and subject to the
conditions set forth in the Offer to Purchase, receipt of which is hereby
acknowledged, and in this Letter of Transmittal (which, together with the Offer
to Purchase, and any amendments or supplements hereto or thereto, collectively
constitute the "Offer"). The Offer is being made in connection with the
Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of April 2, 2001 (the "Merger
Agreement"), among Harris, the Offeror, and the Company.

     Subject to and effective upon acceptance for payment of and payment for the
Shares tendered herewith, the undersigned hereby sells, assigns and transfers to
or upon the order of the Offeror all right, title and interest in and to all the
Shares that are being tendered hereby (and any and all other Shares or other
securities issued or issuable in respect thereof) and appoints the Depositary
the true and lawful agent and attorney-in-fact of the undersigned with respect
to such Shares (and all such other Shares or securities), with full power of
substitution (such power of attorney being deemed to be an irrevocable power
coupled with an interest), to (a) deliver certificates for such Shares (and all
such other Shares or securities), or transfer ownership of such Shares (and all
such other Shares or securities) on the account books maintained by the
Book-Entry Transfer Facility, together, in any such case, with all accompanying
evidences of transfer and authenticity, to or upon the order of the Offeror, (b)
present such Shares (and all such other Shares or securities) for transfer on
the books of the Company and (c) receive all benefits and otherwise exercise all
rights of beneficial ownership of such Shares (and all such other Shares or
securities), all in accordance with the terms of the Offer.

     The undersigned hereby irrevocably appoints each designee of the Offeror as
the agent, attorney-in-fact and proxy of the undersigned, each with full power
of substitution, to exercise all voting and other rights of the undersigned in
such manner as each such attorney and proxy or his substitute shall in his sole
judgment deem proper, with respect to all of the Shares tendered hereby which
have been accepted for payment by the Offeror prior to the time of any vote or
other action (and any and all other Shares or other securities or rights issued
or issuable in respect of such Shares) at any meeting of shareholders of the
Company (whether annual or special and whether or not an adjourned meeting), any
actions by written consent in lieu of any such meeting or otherwise. This proxy
is irrevocable, is coupled with an interest in the Shares and is granted in
consideration of, and is effective upon, the acceptance for payment of such
Shares by the Offeror in accordance with the terms of the Offer. Such acceptance
for payment shall revoke any other power of attorney, proxy or written consent
granted by the undersigned at any time with respect to such Shares (and all such
other Shares or other securities or rights), and no subsequent powers of
attorney or proxies will be given or written consents will be executed by the
undersigned (and if given or executed, will not be deemed effective). The
undersigned understands that in order for Shares to be deemed validly tendered,
immediately upon the acceptance for payment of such Shares, the Offeror or its
designee must be able to exercise full voting rights with respect to such Shares
and other securities, including voting at any meeting of shareholders.

     The undersigned hereby represents and warrants that the undersigned has
full power and authority to tender, sell, assign and transfer the Shares
tendered hereby (and any and all other Shares or other securities or rights
issued or issuable in respect of such Shares) and that when the same are
accepted for payment by the Offeror, the Offeror will acquire good and
unencumbered title thereto, free and clear of all liens, restrictions, charges
and encumbrances and not subject to any adverse claims. The undersigned, upon
request, will execute and deliver any additional documents deemed by the
Depositary or the Offeror to be necessary or desirable to complete the sale,
assignment and transfer of the Shares tendered hereby (and all such other Shares
or other securities or rights).

     All authority herein conferred or agreed to be conferred shall survive the
death or incapacity of the undersigned, and any obligation of the undersigned
hereunder shall be binding upon the heirs, personal representatives, successors
and assigns of the undersigned. Except as stated in the Offer, this tender is
irrevocable.

     The undersigned understands that tenders of Shares pursuant to any one of
the procedures described in Section 3 of the Offer to Purchase and in the
instructions hereto will constitute an agreement between the undersigned and the
Offeror upon the terms and subject to the conditions of the Offer.

     Unless otherwise indicated under "Special Payment Instructions," please
issue the check for the purchase price of any Shares accepted for payment, and
return any Shares not tendered or not accepted for payment, in the name(s) of
the undersigned.

     Similarly, unless otherwise indicated under "Special Delivery
Instructions," please mail the check for the purchase price of any Shares
accepted for payment and return any certificates for Shares not tendered or not
accepted for payment (and accompanying documents, as appropriate) to the
undersigned at the address shown below the undersigned's signature(s). In the
event that both "Special Payment Instructions" and "Special Delivery
Instructions" are completed, please issue the check for the purchase price of
any Shares purchased and return any Shares not tendered or not purchased in the
name(s) of, and deliver said check and any certificates to, the person(s) so

that any Shares not accepted for payment be returned by crediting such account

"Special Payment Instructions," to transfer any Shares from the name of the
registered holder(s) thereof if the Offeror does not accept for payment any of
the Shares so tendered.

             FORMING PART OF THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF THE OFFER

     1.  GUARANTEE OF SIGNATURES FOR SHARES.   Except as otherwise provided
below, signatures on all Letters of Transmittal for Shares must be guaranteed by
a firm that is a bank, broker, dealer, credit union, savings association or
other entity which is a member in good standing of the Securities Transfer
Agents Medallion Program or by any other bank, broker, dealer, credit union,
savings association or other entity which is an "eligible guarantor
institution," as such term is defined in Rule 17Ad-15 under the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934 (each of the foregoing constituting an "Eligible
Institution"), unless the Shares tendered thereby are tendered (i) by a
registered holder of Shares who has not completed either the box labeled
"Special Payment Instructions" or the box labeled "Special Delivery
Instructions" on the Letter of Transmittal or (ii) for the account of an
Eligible Institution. See Instruction 5. If the certificates for Shares are
registered in the name of a person or persons other than the signer of this
Letter of Transmittal, or if payment is to be made or delivered to, or
certificates for unpurchased Shares are to be issued or returned to, a person
other than the registered owner or owners, then the tendered certificates must
be endorsed or accompanied by duly executed stock powers, signed exactly as the
name or names of the registered owner or owners appear on the certificates or
stock powers, with the signatures on the certificates or stock powers guaranteed
by an Eligible Institution as provided herein. See Instruction 5.

     2.  DELIVERY OF LETTER OF TRANSMITTAL AND SHARES.  This Letter of
Transmittal is to be used either if certificates for Shares are to be forwarded
herewith or, unless an Agent's Message (as defined in the Offer to Purchase) is
utilized, if the delivery of Shares is to be made by book-entry transfer
pursuant to the procedures set forth in Section 3 of the Offer to Purchase.
Certificates for all physically delivered Shares, or a confirmation of a
book-entry transfer into the Depositary's account at the Book-Entry Transfer
Facility of all Shares delivered electronically, as well as a properly completed
and duly executed Letter of Transmittal (or a facsimile thereof) and any other
documents required by this Letter of Transmittal, or an Agent's Message in the
case of a book-entry delivery, must be received by the Depositary at one of its
addresses set forth on the front page of this Letter of Transmittal prior to the
Expiration Date. Stockholders who cannot deliver their Shares and all other
required documents to the Depositary prior to the Expiration Date must tender
their Shares pursuant to the guaranteed delivery procedures set forth in Section
3 of the Offer to Purchase. Pursuant to such procedures: (a) such tender must be
made by or through an Eligible Institution; (b) a properly completed and duly
executed Notice of Guaranteed Delivery, substantially in the form provided by
the Offeror, must be received by the Depositary prior to the Expiration Date;
and (c) the certificates for all tendered Shares, in proper form for tender, or
a confirmation of a book-entry transfer into the Depositary's account at the
Book-Entry Transfer Facility of all Shares delivered electronically, as well as
a properly completed and duly executed Letter of Transmittal (or a facsimile
thereof), and any other documents required by this Letter of Transmittal, must
be received by the Depositary within three trading days after the date of
execution of such Notice of Guaranteed Delivery, all as provided in Section 3 of
the Offer to Purchase. The term "trading day" is any day on which the Nasdaq
SmallCap Market is open for business.

     THE METHOD OF DELIVERY OF SHARES, THE LETTER OF TRANSMITTAL AND ALL OTHER
REQUIRED DOCUMENTS, INCLUDING DELIVERY THROUGH THE BOOK-ENTRY TRANSFER FACILITY,
IS AT THE OPTION AND SOLE RISK OF THE TENDERING HOLDER OF SHARES. SHARES WILL BE
DEEMED DELIVERED ONLY WHEN ACTUALLY RECEIVED BY THE DEPOSITARY (INCLUDING, IN
THE CASE OF A BOOK-ENTRY TRANSFER, BY A CONFIRMATION OF A BOOK-ENTRY TRANSFER).
IF DELIVERY IS BY MAIL, REGISTERED MAIL WITH RETURN RECEIPT REQUESTED, PROPERLY
INSURED, IS RECOMMENDED. IN ALL CASES, SUFFICIENT TIME SHOULD BE ALLOWED TO
ENSURE TIMELY DELIVERY.

     No alternative, conditional or contingent tenders will be accepted, and no
fractional Shares will be purchased. By executing this Letter of Transmittal (or
a facsimile thereof), the tendering holder of Shares waives any right to receive
any notice of the acceptance for payment of the Shares.

     3.  INADEQUATE SPACE.  If the space provided herein is inadequate, the
certificate numbers, the number of Shares and any other required information
should be listed on a separate schedule attached hereto and separately signed on
each page thereof in the same manner as this Letter of Transmittal is signed.

     4.  PARTIAL TENDERS (NOT APPLICABLE TO HOLDERS OF SHARES WHO TENDER BY
BOOK-ENTRY TRANSFER).  If fewer than all the Shares represented by any
certificate delivered to the Depositary are to be tendered, fill in the number
of Shares which are to be tendered in the box entitled "Number of Shares
Tendered." In such case, a new certificate for the remainder of the Shares
represented by the old certificate will be sent to the person(s) signing this
Letter of Transmittal unless otherwise provided in the appropriate box marked
"Special Payment Instructions" and/or "Special Delivery Instructions" on this
Letter of Transmittal, as promptly as practicable following the Expiration Date.
All Shares represented by certificates delivered to the Depositary will be
deemed to have been tendered unless otherwise indicated.

     5.  SIGNATURES ON LETTER OF TRANSMITTAL; STOCK POWERS AND ENDORSEMENTS.  If
this Letter of Transmittal is signed by the registered holder(s) of the Shares
tendered hereby, the signature(s) must correspond with the name(s) as written on
the face of the certificates without alteration, enlargement or any change
whatsoever.

     If any of the Shares tendered hereby are held of record by two or more
persons, all such persons must sign this Letter of Transmittal.

     If any of the Shares tendered hereby are registered in different names on
different certificates, it will be necessary to complete, sign and submit as
many separate Letters of Transmittal as there are different registrations of
certificates.

     If this Letter of Transmittal is signed by the registered holder(s) of the
Shares tendered hereby, no endorsements of certificates or separate stock powers
are required unless payment of the purchase price is to be made, or Shares not
tendered or not purchased are to be returned, in the name of any person other
than the registered holder(s), in which case the certificate(s) for such Shares
tendered hereby must be endorsed, or accompanied by, appropriate stock powers,
signed exactly as the name(s) of the registered holder(s) appear(s) on the
certificate for such Shares. Signatures on any such certificates or stock powers
must be guaranteed by an Eligible Institution.

     If this Letter of Transmittal is signed by a person other than the
registered holder(s) of the Shares tendered hereby, the certificate must be
endorsed or accompanied by appropriate stock powers, signed exactly as the
name(s) of the registered holder(s) appear(s) on the certificates for such
Shares. Signature(s) on any such certificates or stock must be guaranteed by an
Eligible Institution.

     If this Letter of Transmittal or any certificate or stock power is signed
by a trustee, executor, administrator, guardian, attorney-in-fact, officer of a
corporation or other person acting in a fiduciary or representative capacity,
such person should so indicate when signing, and proper evidence satisfactory to
the Offeror of the authority of such person so to act must be submitted.

     6.  STOCK TRANSFER TAXES.  The Offeror will pay or cause to be paid any
stock transfer taxes with respect to the sale and transfer of any Shares to it
or its order pursuant to the Offer. If, however, payment of the purchase price
is to be made to, or Shares not tendered or not purchased are to be returned in
the name of, any person other than the registered holder(s), then the amount of
any stock transfer taxes (whether imposed on the registered holder(s), such
other person or otherwise) payable on account of the transfer to such person
will be deducted from the purchase price unless satisfactory evidence of the
payment of such taxes, or exemption therefrom, is submitted.

     Except as provided in this Instruction 6, it will not be necessary for
transfer tax stamps to be affixed to the certificates listed in this Letter of
Transmittal.

     7.  SPECIAL PAYMENT AND DELIVERY INSTRUCTION.  If the check for the
purchase price of any Shares purchased is to be issued, or any Shares not
tendered or not purchased are to be returned, in the name of a person other than
the person(s) signing this Letter of Transmittal or if the check or any
certificates for Shares not tendered or not purchased are to be mailed to
someone other than the person(s) signing this Letter of Transmittal or to the
person(s) signing this Letter of Transmittal at an address other than that shown
above, the appropriate boxes on this Letter of Transmittal should be completed.
Holders of Shares tendering Shares by book-entry transfer may request that
Shares not purchased be credited to such account at the Book-Entry Transfer
Facility as such holder of Shares may designate under "Special Payment
Instructions." If no such instructions are given, any such Shares not purchased
will be returned by crediting the account at the Book-Entry Transfer Facility
designated above.

     8.  SUBSTITUTE FORM W-9.  Under U.S. Federal income tax law, a tendering
holder of Shares whose Shares are accepted for payment is required to provide
the Depositary with such holder's correct taxpayer identification number ("TIN")
on Substitute Form W-9, which is provided below, unless an exemption applies.
Failure to provide the information on the Substitute Form W-9 may subject the
tendering holder of Shares to a $50 penalty and to 31% federal income tax backup
withholding on the payment of the purchase price for the Shares.

     9.  FOREIGN HOLDERS.  Foreign holders must submit a completed IRS Form W-8
to avoid 31% backup withholding. IRS Form W-8 may be obtained by contacting the
Depositary at one of the addresses on the face of this Letter of Transmittal.

     10.  REQUESTS FOR ASSISTANCE OR ADDITIONAL COPIES.  Requests for assistance
or additional copies of the Offer to Purchase and this Letter of Transmittal may
be obtained from the Information Agent at its address or telephone number set
forth below.

     11.  WAIVER OF CONDITIONS.  The conditions of the Offer may be waived by
the Offeror (subject to certain limitations in the Merger Agreement), in whole
or in part, at any time or from time to time, in the Offeror's sole discretion.

     12.  LOST, DESTROYED, MUTILATED, OR STOLEN CERTIFICATES.  If any
certificate(s) representing Shares has been lost, destroyed, mutilated, or
stolen, the holder of such Shares should promptly notify the Depositary by
calling 1-(800) 777-3674. The holder of Shares will then be instructed as to the
steps to be taken in order to replace the certificate(s) or agreement(s). This
Letter of Transmittal and related documents cannot be processed until the
procedures for replacing lost, destroyed, mutilated or stolen certificates have
been followed.

     IMPORTANT:  THIS LETTER OF TRANSMITTAL OR A FACSIMILE COPY HEREOF (TOGETHER
WITH CERTIFICATES OR CONFIRMATION OF BOOK-ENTRY TRANSFER AND ALL OTHER REQUIRED
DOCUMENTS) OR A NOTICE OF GUARANTEED DELIVERY MUST BE RECEIVED BY THE DEPOSITARY
PRIOR TO THE EXPIRATION DATE (AS DEFINED IN THE OFFER TO PURCHASE).

                           IMPORTANT TAX INFORMATION

     Under federal income tax law, a holder of Shares whose tendered Shares are
accepted for payment is required to provide the Depositary with such holder's
correct TIN on the Substitute Form W-9. If such holder of Shares is an
individual, the TIN is such holder's Social Security Number. If the Depositary
is not provided with the correct TIN, the holder of Shares may be subject to a
$50 penalty imposed by the Internal Revenue Service. In addition, payments that
are made to such holder of Shares with respect to Shares purchased pursuant to
the Offer may be subject to backup withholding.

     Certain holders of Shares (including, among others, all corporations and
certain foreign individuals) are not subject to these backup withholding and
reporting requirements. In order for a foreign individual to qualify as an
exempt recipient, that holder of Shares must submit a statement, signed under
penalties of perjury, attesting to that individual's exempt status. Such
statements may be obtained from the Depositary. All exempt recipients (including
foreign persons wishing to qualify as exempt recipients) should see the enclosed
Guidelines for Certification of Taxpayer Identification Number on Substitute
Form W-9 for additional instructions.

     If backup withholding applies, the Depositary is required to withhold 31%
of any payments made to the holder of Shares. Backup withholding is not an
additional tax. Rather, the tax liability of persons subject to backup
withholding will be reduced by the amount of tax withheld. If backup withholding
results in an overpayment of taxes, a refund may be obtained.

PURPOSE OF SUBSTITUTE FORM W-9

     To prevent backup federal income tax withholding on payments that are made
to a holder of Shares with respect to Shares purchased pursuant to the Offer,
the holder is required to notify the Depositary of such holder's correct TIN by
completing the form certifying that the TIN provided on the Substitute Form W-9
is correct.

WHAT NUMBER TO GIVE THE DEPOSITARY

     The holder of Shares is required to give the Depositary the Social Security
Number or Employer Identification Number of the record owner of the Shares. If
the Shares are in more than one name or are not in the name of the actual owner,
consult the enclosed Guidelines for Certification of Taxpayer Identification
Number on Substitute Form W-9 for additional guidelines on which number to
report.

          2. The Board of Directors of the Company unanimously has determined
     that the Offer and the Merger (as defined in the Offer to Purchase) are
     fair to, and in the best interests of, the Company's holders of Shares, has
     approved the Offer, the Merger and the Merger Agreement and unanimously
     recommends that the holders of Shares accept the Offer and tender their
     Shares pursuant to the Offer.

          3. The Offer is being made for all of the outstanding Shares.

          4. The Offer and withdrawal rights will expire at 12:00 Midnight, New
     York City time, on Tuesday, May 15, 2001, unless the Offer is extended.

          5. The Offer is conditioned upon, among other things, (i) there being
     validly tendered and not withdrawn prior to the expiration of the Offer
     that number of Shares constituting at least fifty-one percent (51%) of the
     Voting Shares (the "Minimum Condition"), and (ii) the satisfaction of
     certain other terms and conditions. For purposes of this letter, "Voting
     Shares" means the then outstanding Shares, together with (a) all of the
     Company's then outstanding shares of Class A Preferred Stock, par value
     $.01 per share, and (b) all of the Shares issuable under Options (as
     defined in the Merger Agreement) that are or may become exercisable between

     the Merger Agreement, elect to (i) withdraw the Offer or allow it to expire
     and not accept for payment any Shares and return all tendered Shares to
     tendering holders of Shares, or (ii) extend the Offer as provided in the
     Merger Agreement and, subject to applicable withdrawal rights, retain all
     tendered Shares until the expiration of the Offer, as extended, or (iii)
     waive such condition (in the case of the Minimum Condition, with the
     consent of the Company) and purchase all Shares validly tendered and not
     withdrawn prior to the expiration of the Offer.

          6. Tendering holders of Shares will not be obligated to pay brokerage
     fees or commissions or, except as set forth in Instruction 6 of the Letter
     of Transmittal, stock transfer taxes on the transfer of Shares pursuant to
     the Offer.

     In order for holders of Shares to accept the Offer, (i) a duly executed and
properly completed Letter of Transmittal (or facsimile thereof) and any required
signature guarantees or, in the case of a book-entry transfer, an Agent's
Message (as defined in the Offer to Purchase) or other required documents should
be sent to the Depositary and (ii) Certificates representing the tendered Shares
or a timely Book-Entry Confirmation (as defined in the Offer to Purchase) should
be delivered to the Depositary in accordance with the instructions set forth in
the Offer.

     If holders of Shares wish to tender, but it is impracticable for them to

procedures for book-entry transfer prior to the Expiration Date, a tender must
be effected by following the guaranteed delivery procedures specified in Section
3 of the Offer to Purchase.

     Neither the Offeror, Harris nor any officer, director, shareholder, agent
or other representative of the Offeror will pay any fees or commissions to any

described in the Offer to Purchase) for soliciting tenders of Shares pursuant to
the Offer. The Offeror will, however, upon request, reimburse you for customary
mailing and handling expenses incurred by you in forwarding any of the enclosed
materials to your clients. The Offeror will pay or cause to be paid any transfer
taxes payable on the transfer of Shares to it, except as otherwise provided in
Instruction 6 of the Letter of Transmittal.

     Any inquiries you may have with respect to the Offer should be addressed to

To Our Clients:

     Enclosed for your consideration are the Offer to Purchase, dated April 17,
2001 (the "Offer to Purchase"), and the related Letter of Transmittal (which,
together with any amendments or supplements thereto, collectively constitute the
"Offer") relating to an offer by Manatee Merger Corp., a Delaware corporation
(the "Offeror") and a wholly owned subsidiary of Harris Corporation, a Delaware
corporation ("Harris"), to purchase all outstanding shares of Common Stock
(including the associated Series B Junior Participating Preferred Stock Purchase
Rights), par value $0.01 per share (the "Shares"), of Exigent International,
Inc., a Delaware corporation (the "Company"), at a purchase price of $3.55 per
Share, net to the seller in cash, without interest, upon the terms and subject
to the conditions set forth in the Offer. Also enclosed is a letter to holders
of Shares of the Company from Bernard R. Smedley, the Chairman of the Board and
Chief Executive Officer of the Company, together with a
Solicitation/Recommendation Statement on Schedule 14D-9 filed with the
Securities and Exchange Commission by the Company and mailed to the holders of
Shares. The Offer is being made in connection with the Agreement and Plan of
Merger, dated as of April 2, 2001, among Harris, the Offeror and the Company
(the "Merger Agreement"). This material is being forwarded to you as the
beneficial owner of Shares carried by us in your account but not registered in
your name.

     WE ARE THE HOLDER OF RECORD OF SHARES HELD BY US FOR YOUR ACCOUNT. A TENDER
OF SUCH SHARES CAN BE MADE ONLY BY US AS THE HOLDER OF RECORD AND PURSUANT TO
YOUR INSTRUCTIONS. THE LETTER OF TRANSMITTAL IS FURNISHED TO YOU FOR YOUR
INFORMATION ONLY AND CANNOT BE USED BY YOU TO TENDER SHARES HELD BY US FOR YOUR
ACCOUNT.

     If a holder desires to tender Shares pursuant to the Offer and such
holder's certificates for Shares are not immediately available or time will not
permit all required documents to reach the Depositary (as defined in the Offer
to Purchase) prior to the Expiration Date (as defined in the Offer to Purchase)
or the procedure for book-entry transfer of Shares cannot be completed on a
timely basis, such Shares may nevertheless be tendered according to the
guaranteed delivery procedures set forth in Section 3 of the Offer to Purchase.
See Instruction 2 of the Letter of Transmittal. Delivery of documents to the
Book-Entry Transfer Facility (as defined in the Offer to Purchase) in accordance
with the Book-Entry Transfer Facility's procedures does not constitute delivery
to the Depositary.

     Accordingly, we request instructions as to whether you wish to tender any
or all of the Shares held by us for your account, upon the terms and conditions
set forth in the Offer.

     Please note the following:

          1. The tender price is $3.55 per Share net to the seller in cash
     without interest.

          2. The Board of Directors of the Company unanimously has determined
     that the Offer and the Merger (as defined in the Offer to Purchase) are
     fair to, and in the best interests of, the Company's holders of Shares, has
     approved the Offer, the Merger and the Merger Agreement and unanimously
     recommends that the holders of Shares accept the Offer and tender their
     Shares pursuant to the Offer.

          3. The Offer is being made for all of the outstanding Shares.

          4. The Offer and withdrawal rights will expire at 12:00 Midnight, New
     York City time, on Tuesday, May 15, 2001, unless the Offer is extended.

          5. The Offer is conditioned upon, among other things, (i) there being
     validly tendered and not withdrawn prior to the expiration of the Offer
     that number of Shares constituting at least fifty-one percent (51%) of the
     Voting Shares (the "Minimum Condition"), and (ii) the satisfaction of
     certain other terms and conditions. For purposes of this letter, "Voting
     Shares" means the then outstanding Shares, together with (a) all of the
     Company's then outstanding shares of Class A Preferred Stock, par value
     $.01 per share, and (b) all of the Shares issuable under Options (as
     defined in the Merger Agreement) that are or may become exercisable between
     the date on which the Offeror first pays for Shares validly tendered and

     and the Effective Time (as defined in the Merger Agreement) or under any
     other option, warrant, convertible security or right or other commitment or
     arrangement in effect on the Tender Offer Acceptance Date. If the Minimum
     Condition or any other condition to the Offer is not satisfied by 12:00
     Midnight, New York City time, on Tuesday, May 15, 2001 (or any other time
     then set as the Expiration Date), the Offeror may, subject to the terms of
     the Merger Agreement, elect to (i) withdraw the Offer or allow it to expire
     and not accept for payment any Shares and return all tendered Shares to
     tendering holders of Shares, or (ii) extend the Offer as provided in the
     Merger Agreement and, subject to applicable withdrawal rights, retain all

     waive such condition (in the case of the Minimum Condition, with the
     consent of the Company) and purchase all shares validly tendered and not
     withdrawn prior to the expiration of the Offer.

          6. Tendering holders of Shares will not be obligated to pay brokerage
     fees or commissions or, except as set forth in Instruction 6 of the Letter
     of Transmittal, stock transfer taxes on the transfer of Shares pursuant to
     the Offer.

     If you wish to have us tender any or all of the Shares, please so instruct
us by completing, executing, detaching and returning to us the instruction form
contained in this letter. An envelope to return your instruction to us is
enclosed. If you authorize tender of your Shares, all such Shares will be
tendered unless otherwise indicated in such instruction form. PLEASE FORWARD
YOUR INSTRUCTIONS TO US AS SOON AS POSSIBLE TO ALLOW US AMPLE TIME TO TENDER
YOUR SHARES ON YOUR BEHALF PRIOR TO THE EXPIRATION OF THE OFFER.

     The Offer is made solely by the Offer to Purchase and the related Letter of
Transmittal and any supplements or amendments thereto. The Offer is not being
made to, nor will tenders be accepted from or on behalf of, holders of Shares
residing in any jurisdiction in which the making of the Offer or acceptance
thereof would not be in compliance with the securities laws of such
jurisdiction. In any jurisdiction where the securities, blue sky or other laws
require the Offer to be made by a licensed broker or dealer, the Offer will be
deemed to be made on behalf of the Offeror by one or more registered brokers or
dealers licensed under the laws of such jurisdiction.

Security Administration or the Internal Revenue Service.

PAYEES EXEMPT FROM BACKUP WITHHOLDING

    which have at least one nonresident alien partner.

  Exempt payees described above should file a Substitute Form W-9 to avoid
possible erroneous backup withholding. FILE THIS FORM WITH THE PAYER, FURNISH
YOUR TAXPAYER IDENTIFICATION NUMBER, WRITE "EXEMPT" ON THE FACE OF THE FORM, AND
RETURN IT TO THE PAYER. IF THE PAYMENTS ARE INTEREST, DIVIDENDS, OR PATRONAGE
DIVIDENDS, ALSO SIGN AND DATE THE FORM.

  Certain payments other than interest, dividends and patronage dividends that
are not subject to information reporting are also not subject to backup
withholding. For details, see the regulations under sections 6041, 6041A(a),
6045, and 6050A.

  PRIVACY ACT NOTICE. -- Section 6109 requires most recipients of dividend,
interest, or other payments to give taxpayer identification numbers to payers
who must report the payments to the IRS. The IRS uses the numbers for
identification purposes and to help verify the accuracy of your tax return.
Payers must be given the numbers whether or not recipients are required to file
tax returns. Payers must generally withhold 31% of taxable interest, dividend
and certain other payments to a payee who does not furnish a taxpayer
identification number to a payer. Certain penalties may also apply.

PENALTIES
(1) PENALTY FOR FAILURE TO FURNISH TAXPAYER IDENTIFICATION NUMBER. -- If you
fail to furnish your taxpayer identification number to a payer, you are subject
to a penalty of $50 for each such failure unless your failure is due to
reasonable cause and not to willful neglect.
(2) CIVIL PENALTY FOR FALSE INFORMATION WITH RESPECT TO WITHHOLDING. -- If you
make a false statement with no reasonable basis which results in no imposition
of backup withholding, you are subject to a penalty of $500.
(3) CRIMINAL PENALTY FOR FALSIFYING INFORMATION. -- Falsifying certifications or
affirmations may subject you to criminal penalties including fines and/or
imprisonment.

                  FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION CONTACT YOUR TAX
                  CONSULTANT OR THE INTERNAL REVENUE SERVICE.

                               HARRIS CORPORATION

         Manatee Merger Corp., a Delaware corporation (the "Offeror") and a
wholly owned subsidiary of Harris Corporation, a Delaware corporation
("Harris"), is offering to purchase all outstanding shares of Common Stock
(including the associated Series B Junior Participating Preferred Stock Purchase
Rights), par value $0.01 per share (the "Shares"), of Exigent International,
Inc., a Delaware corporation (the "Company"), at a purchase price of $3.55 per
Share, net to the seller in cash (subject to applicable withholding taxes),
without interest, upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the
Offer to Purchase, dated April 17, 2001 (the "Offer to Purchase"), and in the
related Letter of Transmittal (which, together with any amendments or
supplements thereto, collectively constitute the "Offer"). Unless the context
indicates otherwise, all references to Shares shall include the associated
Rights issued pursuant to the Rights Agreement dated as of October 27, 1998,
between the Company and Reliance Trust Company, as amended. The purpose of the
Offer is for Harris to acquire a majority voting interest in the Company as a
first stop in acquiring all of the equity of the Company.

         The Offer is being made pursuant to the Agreement and Plan of Merger,
dated as of April 2, 2001 (the "Merger Agreement"), among Harris, the Offeror
and the Company. The Merger Agreement provides that after the purchase of the
Shares pursuant to the Offer and the satisfaction of the other conditions set
forth in the Merger Agreement and in accordance with the relevant provisions of
the Delaware General Corporation Law, as amended (the "DGCL"), the Offeror will
be merged with and into the Company (the "Merger"). At the effective time of the
Merger (the "Effective Time"), each Share that is issued and outstanding (other
than Shares owned by Harris, the Offeror or any wholly owned subsidiary of
Harris or Shares held by shareholders who perfect their appraisal rights under
the DGCL) will be canceled and converted into the right to receive $3.55 (or any
higher price that may be paid for each Share pursuant to the Offer) in cash,
without interest thereon.

  THE OFFER AND WITHDRAWAL RIGHTS WILL EXPIRE AT 12:00 MIDNIGHT, NEW YORK CITY
         TIME, ON TUESDAY, MAY 15, 2001, UNLESS THE OFFER IS EXTENDED.

         THE OFFER IS CONDITIONED UPON, AMONG OTHER THINGS, (I) THERE BEING
VALIDLY TENDERED AND NOT WITHDRAWN PRIOR TO THE EXPIRATION OF THE OFFER SHARES
THAT, WHEN COMBINED WITH THE SHARES, IF ANY, ALREADY OWNED BY HARRIS AND ITS
DIRECT OR INDIRECT SUBSIDIARIES, CONSTITUTE AT LEAST 51% OF THE COMPANY'S THEN
OUTSTANDING "VOTING SHARES" (DEFINED AS THE SHARES, THE THEN ISSUED AND
OUTSTANDING SHARES OF THE COMPANY'S CLASS A PREFERRED STOCK, PAR VALUE $0.01 PER
SHARE, AND ALL SHARES ISSUABLE UNDER OPTIONS (AS DEFINED IN THE MERGER
AGREEMENT) THAT ARE OR MAY BECOME EXERCISABLE BETWEEN SUCH EXPIRATION DATE AND
THE EFFECTIVE TIME OR UNDER ANY OTHER OPTION, WARRANT, CONVERTIBLE SECURITY OR
RIGHT OR OTHER COMMITMENT OR ARRANGEMENT) (THE "MINIMUM CONDITION") AND (II) THE
SATISFACTION OF CERTAIN OTHER TERMS AND CONDITIONS. SEE SECTION 15 OF THE OFFER
TO PURCHASE.

         In connection with the Merger Agreement, Harris and the Offeror entered
into a Voting and Tender Agreement dated as of April 2, 2001 with Bernard R.
Smedley, Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer of the Company,
whereby he has agreed, among other things, to tender all of his Shares pursuant
to the Offer.

         THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS OF THE COMPANY HAS UNANIMOUSLY APPROVED THE
MERGER AGREEMENT, THE OFFER AND THE MERGER, HAS DETERMINED THAT THE TERMS OF THE
OFFER AND THE MERGER ARE FAIR TO, AND IN THE BEST INTERESTS OF, THE HOLDERS OF
SHARES AND UNANIMOUSLY RECOMMENDS THAT THE HOLDERS OF SHARES ACCEPT THE OFFER
AND TENDER THEIR SHARES PURSUANT TO THE OFFER.

         For purposes of the Offer, the Offeror will be deemed to have accepted
for payment, and thereby purchased, Shares validly tendered and not withdrawn,
if and when the Offeror gives oral or written notice to Mellon Investor
Services, L.L.C. (the "Depositary") of the Offeror's acceptance of such Shares
for payment. In all cases, payment for Shares purchased pursuant to the Offer
will be made by deposit of the purchase price with the Depositary, which shall
act as agent for tendering holders of Shares for the purpose of receiving
payment from the Offeror and transmitting payment to the tendering holders of
Shares. Payment for Shares purchased pursuant to the Offer will be made only
after timely receipt by the Depositary of (i) certificates for such Shares, or
timely confirmation of a book-entry transfer of such Shares into the
Depositary's account at the Book-Entry Transfer Facility (as defined in the
Offer to Purchase), (ii) a properly completed and executed Letter of Transmittal
(or facsimile thereof), with any required signature guarantees or, in the case
of a book-entry transfer of Shares, an Agent's Message (as defined in the Offer
to Purchase), and (iii) any other documents required by the Letter of
Transmittal.

         If the Minimum Condition or any other condition to the Offer is not
satisfied by 12:00 Midnight, New York City time, on Tuesday, May 15, 2001 (or
any other time then set as the Expiration Date), the Offeror may, subject to the
terms of the Merger Agreement, elect to (i) withdraw the Offer or allow it to
expire and not accept for payment any Shares and return all tendered Shares to
tendering holders of Shares, (ii) extend the Offer as provided in the Merger
Agreement and, subject to applicable withdrawal rights, retain all tendered
Shares until the expiration of the Offer, as extended, or (iii) waive such
condition (in the case of the Minimum Condition, with the consent of the
Company) and purchase all Shares validly tendered and not withdrawn prior to
expiration of the Offer. The Offeror reserves the right, in its sole discretion,
to terminate the Offer if, at any time prior to the payment for Shares pursuant
to the Offer, any of the conditions set forth in the Offer to Purchase that
relate to the Offeror's obligations to purchase the Shares, including the
Minimum Condition, have not been satisfied.

         The term "Expiration Date" shall mean 12:00 Midnight, New York City
time, on Tuesday, May 15, 2001, unless the Offeror shall have extended the
period of time for which the Offer is open, in which event the term "Expiration
Date" shall mean the latest time and date at which the Offer, as so extended,
shall expire. The Offeror does not currently intend to make a subsequent
offering period available following the Expiration Date pursuant to Rule 14d-11
under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"),
although it reserves the right to do so.

         Subject to the limitations set forth in the Offer and the Merger
Agreement, the Offeror reserves the right, at any time or from time to time in
its sole discretion, to extend the period during which the Offer is open by
giving oral or written notice of such extension to the Depositary and by making
a public announcement of such extension. There can be no assurance that the
Offeror will exercise its right to extend the Offer. Any extension of the period
during which the Offer is open will be followed, as promptly as practicable, by
public announcement thereof, such announcement to be issued not later than 9:00
a.m., New York City time, on the next business day after the previously
scheduled Expiration Date. During any extension, all Shares previously tendered
and not withdrawn will remain subject to the Offer and subject to the right of a
tendering holder of Shares to withdraw such holder's Shares. Under no
circumstances will the Offeror pay interest on the purchase price for tendered
Shares, regardless of any extension of the Offer or any delay in making such
payment.

         Except as otherwise provided in Section 4 of the Offer to Purchase,
tenders of Shares made pursuant to the Offer are irrevocable. Shares tendered
pursuant to the Offer may be withdrawn at any time prior to the Expiration Date,
and, unless theretofore accepted for payment, may also be withdrawn at any time
after June 16, 2001. For a withdrawal to be effective, a written or facsimile
transmission notice of withdrawal must be timely received by the Depositary at
one of its addresses set forth on the back cover of the Offer to Purchase. Any
such notice of withdrawal must specify the name of the person who tendered the
Shares to be withdrawn, the number of Shares to be withdrawn and (if
certificates representing Shares have been tendered) the name in which the
certificates or agreements are registered, if different from the name of the
person who tendered the Shares. If certificates representing Shares have been
delivered or otherwise identified to the Depositary, then, prior to the physical
release of such certificates, the serial numbers shown on such certificates must
be submitted to the Depositary and, unless such Shares have been tendered for
the account of an Eligible Institution (as defined in the Offer to Purchase),
the signatures on the notice of withdrawal must be guaranteed by an Eligible
Institution. If Shares have been tendered pursuant to the procedures for
book-entry transfer, any notice of withdrawal must also specify the name and
number of the account at the Book-Entry Transfer Facility to be credited with
the withdrawn Shares and must otherwise comply with such Book-Entry Transfer
Facility's

procedures. All questions as to the form and validity (including time of
receipt) of a notice of withdrawal will be determined by the Offeror, in its
sole discretion, and its determination shall be final and binding on all
parties.

         The information required to be disclosed by paragraph (d)(1) of Rule
14d-6 of the Exchange Act is contained in the Offer to Purchase and is
incorporated herein by reference.

         The Company has provided to the Offeror its lists of holders of Shares
and security position listings for the purpose of disseminating the Offer to
holders of Shares. The Offer to Purchase, the Letter of Transmittal and other
materials are being mailed to record holders of Shares and will be mailed to
brokers, dealers, commercial banks, trust companies and similar persons whose
names, or the names of whose nominees, appear on the lists of holders of Shares
or, if applicable, who are listed as participants in a clearing agency's
security position listing, for subsequent transmittal to beneficial owners of
Shares.

         THE OFFER TO PURCHASE AND THE RELATED LETTER OF TRANSMITTAL CONTAIN
IMPORTANT INFORMATION THAT SHOULD BE READ BEFORE ANY DECISION IS MADE WITH
RESPECT TO THE OFFER.

         The receipt of cash for Shares pursuant to the Offer will be a taxable
transaction for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Holders of Shares should
consult with their own tax advisors as to the specific tax consequences of the
Offer and the Merger to them. See Section 5 of the Offer to Purchase for
additional information.

         Any questions or requests for assistance or for copies of the Offer to
Purchase and the related Letter of Transmittal and other tender offer materials
may be directed to the Information Agent or the Dealer Manager as set forth

                          AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER

         AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER, dated as of April 2, 2001 (this
"AGREEMENT"), by and among Harris Corporation, a Delaware corporation
("ACQUIROR"), Manatee Merger Corp., a Delaware corporation and a direct, wholly
owned subsidiary of Acquiror ("ACQUIROR SUB"), and Exigent International, Inc.,
a Delaware corporation (the "TARGET").

                              W I T N E S S E T H:

         WHEREAS, the Boards of Directors of Acquiror, Acquiror Sub and the
Target have each determined that it is advisable and in the best interests of
their respective companies and shareholders for Acquiror, through Acquiror Sub,
to acquire the Target upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth
herein;

         WHEREAS, in furtherance of such acquisition, it is proposed that
Acquiror will cause Acquiror Sub to make a cash tender offer (as it may be
amended from time to time as permitted by this Agreement, the "OFFER") to
acquire all of the issued and outstanding shares of common stock, par value
$0.01 per share, of the Target ("TARGET COMMON STOCK") including the associated
rights ("RIGHTS") to purchase shares of Series B Junior Participating Preferred
Stock issued pursuant to the Target's Rights Plan (as hereinafter defined) (the
shares of Target Common Stock, together with the associated Rights being
hereinafter individually referred to as a "SHARE" and being hereinafter
collectively referred to as the "SHARES") for $3.55 per Share (such amount, or
any greater amount per Share paid pursuant to the Offer being hereinafter
referred to as the "PER SHARE AMOUNT") net to the seller in cash, without
interest thereon, upon the terms and subject to the conditions of this
Agreement, including ANNEX A hereto, and the Offer;

         WHEREAS, the Board of Directors of Acquiror and Acquiror Sub have
approved the making of the Offer and the transactions related thereto;

         WHEREAS, the Board of Directors of the Target has (a) approved this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, including the Offer and (b)
declared the advisability and fairness of this Agreement and resolved and
agreed, subject to the terms and conditions contained herein, to recommend that
holders of Shares tender their Shares pursuant to the Offer;

         WHEREAS, also in furtherance of such acquisition, the Boards of
Directors of Acquiror, Acquiror Sub and the Target have each approved the merger
(the "MERGER") of Acquiror Sub with and into the Target in accordance with the
Delaware General Corporation Act ("DELAWARE LAW") following the consummation of
the Offer pursuant to which each issued and outstanding Share not owned by the
Acquiror or the Target and not constituting Dissenting Shares (as hereinafter
defined) will be converted into the right to receive the per Share consideration
paid pursuant to the Offer and upon the terms and subject to the conditions set
forth herein;

         WHEREAS, in order to induce Acquiror and Acquiror Sub to enter into
this Agreement, concurrently herewith Acquiror and a certain shareholder of the

Target (the "Tendering Shareholder") are entering into a Voting and Tender
Agreement dated as of the date hereof (the "VOTING AND TENDER AGREEMENT") in the
form attached hereto as EXHIBIT A; and

         WHEREAS, the parties hereto desire to make certain representations,
warranties, covenants and agreements in connection herewith.

         NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the mutual
covenants and agreements herein contained, and intending to be legally bound
hereby, Acquiror, Acquiror Sub and the Target hereby agree as follows:

                                    ARTICLE I

                                    THE OFFER

         SECTION 1.01. THE OFFER. (a) Provided that this Agreement shall not
have been terminated in accordance with Section 8.01 and none of the events set
forth in ANNEX A hereto shall have occurred or be existing (unless such event
shall have been waived by Acquiror Sub), Acquiror shall cause Acquiror Sub to
commence, and Acquiror Sub shall commence, the Offer at the Per Share Amount as
prompt as reasonably practicable after the date hereof, but in no event later
than fifteen (15) days after the date hereof. The initial expiration date for
the Offer (the "INITIAL OFFER EXPIRATION DATE") shall be no longer than twenty
(20) business days following the commencement of the Offer. The obligation of
Acquiror Sub to accept for payment and pay for Shares tendered pursuant to the
Offer shall be subject only to (i) the condition (the "MINIMUM CONDITION") that
at least the number of Shares that, when combined with the Shares, if any,
already owned by Acquiror and its direct and indirect subsidiaries, constitute
fifty-one percent (51%) of the "Voting Shares" shall have been validly tendered
and not withdrawn prior to the expiration of the Offer and (ii) the satisfaction
or waiver of the other conditions set forth in ANNEX A hereto and to the terms
and conditions of this Agreement. "VOTING SHARES" means the then outstanding
Shares, together with all of the then issued and outstanding shares of Class A
Preferred Stock, par value $.01 per share (the "Class A Preferred Stock") and
all of the Shares issuable under Options (as defined in Section 2.07) that are
or may become exercisable between the Tender Offer Acceptance Date (as defined
below) and the Effective Time (as defined in Section 2.02) or under any other
option, warrant, convertible security or right or other commitment or
arrangement in effect on the Tender Offer Acceptance Date. Acquiror Sub
expressly reserves the right to waive any such condition (other than the Minimum
Condition), to increase the price per Share payable in the Offer, and to make
any other changes in the terms and conditions of the Offer; provided, however,
that (notwithstanding Section 8.03) no change may be made which (A) decreases
the price per Share payable in the Offer, (B) reduces the maximum number of
Shares to be purchased in the Offer, (C) imposes conditions to the Offer in
addition to those set forth in ANNEX A hereto, (D) amends or changes the terms

and conditions of the Offer in any manner materially adverse to the holders of
Shares (other than Acquiror and its subsidiaries) or (E) changes or waives the
Minimum Condition without the consent of the Target. Notwithstanding the
foregoing sentence, Acquiror Sub may, without the consent of the Target (x)
extend the Offer for one or more subsequent offering periods of up to an
additional 20 business days in the aggregate, if at the scheduled or extended
expiration date of the Offer any of the conditions to Acquiror Sub's obligations
to purchase the Shares have not been satisfied or waived, (y) extend the Offer
for any period required by any rule, regulation, interpretation or position of
the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") or the staff thereof
applicable to the Offer or any period required by applicable law, and (z) extend
the Offer for one or more subsequent offering periods of up to an additional 20
business days in the aggregate pursuant to Rule 14d-11 of the Exchange Act (as
hereinafter defined). For purposes of this Agreement, the "MC OFFER EXPIRATION
DATE" shall mean the expiration date of the Offer, including any extension
occurring pursuant to clause (x) or clause (y) of the immediately preceding
sentence and the "Tender Offer Acceptance Date" means the date on which Acquiror
Sub shall have first paid for Shares validly tendered and not withdrawn pursuant
to the Offer. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Offer may not be extended
beyond the date of termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section 8. The Per
Share Amount shall, subject to applicable withholding of taxes, be net to the
seller in cash, without interest thereon, upon the terms and subject to the
conditions of the Offer. Subject to the terms and conditions of the Offer
(including, without limitation, the Minimum Condition), Acquiror Sub shall
accept for payment and pay, as promptly as practicable after expiration of the
Offer, for all Shares validly tendered and not withdrawn.

         (b) As soon as reasonably practicable on the date of commencement of
the Offer, Acquiror Sub shall file with the SEC and disseminate to holders of
Shares to the extent required by law a Tender Offer Statement on Schedule TO
(together with all amendments and supplements thereto, the "SCHEDULE TO") with
respect to the Offer and the other Transactions (as hereinafter defined). The
Schedule TO shall contain or shall incorporate by reference an offer to purchase
(the "OFFER TO PURCHASE") and forms of the related letter of transmittal and any
other appropriate documents (the Schedule TO, the Offer to Purchase and such
other documents, together with all supplements and amendments thereto, being
referred to herein collectively as the "OFFER DOCUMENTS"). Acquiror, Acquiror
Sub and the Target agree to correct promptly any information provided by any of
them for use in the Offer Documents which shall have become false or misleading
in any material respect, and Acquiror and Acquiror Sub further agree to take all
steps necessary to cause the Schedule TO as so corrected to be filed with the
SEC and the other Offer Documents as so corrected to be disseminated to holders
of Shares, in each case as and to the extent required by applicable federal
securities laws. The Target and its counsel shall be given an opportunity to
review and comment on the Offer Documents and any amendments thereto prior to
the filing thereof with the SEC. Acquiror and Acquiror Sub will provide the
Target and its counsel with a copy of any written comments or telephonic
notification of any verbal comments Acquiror or Acquiror Sub may receive from
the SEC or its staff with respect to the Offer Documents promptly after the
receipt thereof and will provide the Target and its counsel with a copy of any
written responses and telephonic notification of any verbal response of
Acquiror, Acquiror Sub or their counsel. In the event that the Offer is
terminated or withdrawn by Acquiror Sub, Acquiror and Acquiror Sub shall cause
all tendered Shares to be returned to the registered holders of the Shares
represented by the certificate or certificates surrendered to the Paying Agent
(as defined herein).

         SECTION 1.02. TARGET ACTION. (a) The Target hereby approves of and
consents to the Offer and represents that (i) the Target's Board of Directors,
at a meeting duly called and held on April 2, 2001, has (A) determined that this
Agreement, the Voting and Tender Agreement and the transactions contemplated
hereby and thereby, including, without limitation, the terms of the Offer and

entering into the Merger (collectively, the "TRANSACTIONS"), are fair to and in
the best interests of the holders of Shares (other than Acquiror and its
Subsidiaries), (B) approved, adopted and declared the advisability of this
Agreement and the Transactions and (C) resolved to recommend, subject to the
conditions set forth herein, that the shareholders of the Target accept the
Offer and approve this Agreement and the Transactions; (D) acknowledged that
such approval is effective for purposes of Section 203 of the Delaware Law and
for purposes of subsection 2(d)(7) of Section 607.0902 of the Florida Statutes
(the "FLORIDA CONTROL-SHARE ACQUISITION LAW"), (E) approved and adopted an
amendment to the Rights Plan (as defined in Section 3.03) providing that the
execution of this Agreement or the Voting and Tender Agreement, or consummation
of the Transactions, will not cause (a) the Rights to become exercisable under
the Rights Plan or to separate from the stock certificates, (b) a Distribution
Date or Share Acquisition Date each as defined in the Rights Plan to occur or
(c) Acquiror, Acquiror Sub or any of their Affiliates to be deemed an Acquiring
Person (as defined in the Rights Plan), and (ii) CIBC World Markets Corp.
("TARGET BANKER") has delivered to the Target's Board of Directors an opinion to
the effect that, as of the date of this Agreement, the consideration to be
received in the Offer and the Merger by the holders of Shares (other than the
Acquiror and its affiliates) is fair, from a financial point of view, to such
holders. The Target has been authorized by Target Banker, subject to prior
review and approval of Target Banker, to include a reproduced copy of such
opinion (or references thereto) in the Offer to Purchase and in the Schedule
14D-9 (as defined in paragraph (b) of this Section 1.02) and the Proxy Statement
referred to in Section 6.02. The Target hereby consents to the inclusion in the
Offer Documents of the recommendation of the Target's Board of Directors
described above; provided, however, that subject to the provisions of Section
6.05, such recommendation may be withdrawn, modified or amended in connection
with a Superior Proposal (as defined in Section 6.05).

         (b) As soon as reasonably practicable on the date of commencement of
the Offer, the Target shall file with the SEC a Solicitation/Recommendation
Statement on Schedule 14D-9 (together with all amendments and supplements
thereto, the "SCHEDULE 14D-9") containing, (subject to the right to withdraw,
amend or modify such recommendation in accordance with Section 6.05), the
recommendation of the Target's Board of Directors described in Section 1.02(a)
and shall disseminate the Schedule 14D-9 to the extent required by Rule 14d-9
promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "EXCHANGE
ACT"), and any other applicable federal securities laws. The Target, Acquiror
and Acquiror Sub agree to correct promptly any information provided by any of
them for use in the Schedule 14D-9 which shall have become false or misleading,
and the Target further agrees to take all steps necessary to cause the Schedule
14D-9 as so corrected to be filed with the SEC and disseminated to holders of
Shares, in each case as and to the extent required by applicable federal
securities laws. The Schedule 14D-9 shall comply in all material respects with
the applicable provisions of the securities laws. Acquiror, Acquiror Sub and
their counsel shall be given an opportunity to review and comment on the
Schedule 14D-9 and any amendments thereto prior to the filing thereof with the
SEC. The Target will provide Acquiror and Acquiror Sub and their counsel with a
copy of any written comments or telephonic notification of any verbal comments
the Target may receive from the SEC or its staff with respect to the Schedule
14D-9 promptly after the receipt thereof and will provide Acquiror and Acquiror
Sub and their counsel with a copy of any written responses and telephonic
notification of any verbal response of the Target or its counsel.

         (c) The Target shall promptly furnish Acquiror Sub with mailing labels
containing the names and addresses of all record holders of Shares and with
security position listings of Shares held in stock depositories, each as of the
most recent date reasonably practicable. The Target shall furnish Acquiror Sub
with such additional information, including, without limitation, updated
listings and computer files of shareholders, mailing labels and security
position listings, and such other assistance as Acquiror, Acquiror Sub or their
agents may reasonably request. Subject to the requirements of applicable law,
and except for such steps as are necessary to disseminate the Offer Documents
and any other documents necessary to consummate the Offer or the Merger,
Acquiror and Acquiror Sub shall hold in confidence the information contained in
such labels, listings and files, shall use such information only in connection
with the Offer and the Merger, and, if this Agreement shall be terminated in
accordance with Section 8.01, shall deliver promptly to the Target all copies of
such information then in their possession and shall certify in writing to the
Target its compliance with this Section 1.02(c).

                                   ARTICLE II

                                   THE MERGER

         SECTION 2.01. THE MERGER. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions
set forth in this Agreement (including Article VII), and in accordance with
Delaware Law, at the Effective Time (as hereinafter defined), Acquiror Sub shall
be merged with and into the Target. As a result of the Merger, the separate
corporate existence of Acquiror Sub shall cease and the Target shall continue as
the surviving corporation of the Merger (the "SURVIVING CORPORATION"). The name
of the Surviving Corporation shall be Harris-Exigent, Inc.. At the election of
the Acquiror, any direct or indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Acquiror may be
substituted for Acquiror Sub as a constituent corporation in the Merger. In such
event, this Agreement shall be deemed modified to reflect the foregoing, and if
requested by Acquiror, the Target agrees to execute an appropriate amendment to
this Agreement in order to reflect the foregoing.

         SECTION 2.02. EFFECTIVE TIME; CLOSING. As promptly as practicable and
in no event later than ninety (90) days after consummation of the Offer, the
satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth in Article VII, (or such
other date as may be agreed by each of the parties hereto), the parties hereto
shall cause the Merger to be consummated by filing a certificate of merger (the
"CERTIFICATE OF MERGER") with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware
(the "SECRETARY") in such form as is required by, and executed in accordance
with the relevant provisions of, Delaware Law. The term "EFFECTIVE TIME" means
the date and time of the filing of the Certificate of Merger with the Secretary
(or such later time as may be agreed in writing by each of the parties hereto
and specified in the Certificate of Merger). Immediately prior to the filing of
the Certificate of Merger, a closing will be held at the Miami, Florida offices
of Baker & McKenzie (or such other place and time as the parties may agree).

         SECTION 2.03. EFFECT OF THE MERGER. The effect of the Merger shall be
as provided in the applicable provisions of Delaware Law.

         SECTION 2.04. ARTICLES OF INCORPORATION; BYLAWS. (a) At the Effective
Time, the Certificate of Incorporation of the Acquiror Sub, as in effect
immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall be the Certificate of
Incorporation of the Surviving Corporation until thereafter amended as permitted
by Delaware Law provided that the name shall be changed to Harris-Exigent, Inc.

         (b) At the Effective Time, the Bylaws of Acquiror Sub, as in effect
immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall be the Bylaws of the Surviving
Corporation until thereafter amended as provided by law, the Certificate of
Incorporation of the Surviving Corporation and such Bylaws.

         SECTION 2.05. DIRECTORS AND OFFICERS. The directors of Acquiror Sub
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the initial directors of the
Surviving Corporation, each to hold office in accordance with the Certificate of
Incorporation and Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation until a successor is
elected or appointed and has qualified or until the earliest of such director's
death, resignation, removal or disqualification, and the officers of the
Acquiror Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the initial
officers of the Surviving Corporation, in each case until their respective
successors are duly elected or appointed and qualified, or as otherwise provided
in the Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation.

         SECTION 2.06. CONVERSION OF SECURITIES. At the Effective Time, by
virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of Acquiror Sub, the
Target or the holders of any of the following shares of capital stock:

         (a) Each Share and each share of Class A Preferred Stock issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than any Shares to be
canceled pursuant to Section 2.06(b) and any Dissenting Shares (as hereinafter
defined)) shall be canceled and shall be converted automatically into the right
to receive an amount equal to the Per Share Amount in cash (the "MERGER
CONSIDERATION") payable, without interest, to the holder of such Share, upon
surrender, in the manner provided in Section 2.09, of the certificate that
formerly evidenced such Share. All such Shares and such shares of Class A
Preferred Stock when so converted shall no longer be outstanding and shall
automatically be cancelled and retired and each holder of a certificate
representing such Shares shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto,
except the right to receive the Merger Consideration, without interest;

         (b) Each Share held in the treasury of the Target and each Share owned
by Acquiror Sub, Acquiror or any direct or indirect wholly owned subsidiary of
Acquiror or of the Target immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be
cancelled without any conversion thereof and no payment or distribution shall be
made with respect thereto; and

         (c) Each share of Common Stock, par value $0.01 per share, of Acquiror
Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be
converted into and exchanged for one validly issued, fully paid and
nonassessable share of Common Stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Surviving
Corporation and shall constitute the only outstanding shares of capital stock of
the Surviving Corporation.

         SECTION 2.07. EMPLOYEE STOCK OPTIONS. Immediately after the Effective
Time, each outstanding option to purchase Shares (in each case, an "OPTION")
granted under the Target's (a) Incentive Stock Option Plan 1Q (Non-Qualified),
(b) Incentive Stock Option Plan 2Q, (c) Incentive Stock Option Plan 3Q, (d)
Incentive Stock Option Plan 4Q, (e) Independent Directors Stock Option Plan
(5NQ), (f) Stock Option Plan 6NQ and (g) Exigent International, Inc. Omnibus
Stock Option and Incentive Plan (such plans (a) - (g) being hereinafter
collectively referred to as the `Target Option Plans"), that is then exercisable
and vested, shall, subject to the Target's receipt of any required consent of
the holders of such Options, be cancelled by the Target, and each holder of a
cancelled Option shall be entitled to receive from Acquiror Sub at the same time
as payment for Shares is made by Acquiror Sub in connection with the Merger, in
consideration for the cancellation of such Option, an amount in cash equal to
the product of (i) the number of Shares previously subject to such Option and
(ii) the excess, if any, of the Per Share Amount over the exercise price per
Share previously subject to such Option. Each Option that is not canceled as
described above shall continue to have, and be subject to, the same terms and
conditions set forth in the applicable Target Option Plan and agreement pursuant
to which such Option was issued as in effect immediately prior to the Effective
Time, except that (i) each of the Shares for which such Option is exercisable
shall at the Effective Time be converted into the right to receive an amount in
cash equal to the Per Share Amount, and (ii) such Option shall therefore be
exercisable for an amount in cash equal to the product of (x) the excess, if
any, of the Per Share Amount over the per-share exercise price for such Option,
multiplied by (y) the number of shares of Target Common Stock previously subject
to such Option.

         SECTION 2.08. DISSENTING SHARES. Notwithstanding any provision of this
Agreement to the contrary, Shares and shares of Class A Preferred Stock that are
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and which are held by
shareholders who shall not have voted in favor of this Agreement or consented
thereto in writing and who shall have timely demanded appraisal rights in
accordance with Section 262 of Delaware Law (collectively, the "DISSENTING
SHARES") shall not be converted into or represent the right to receive the
Merger Consideration. Such shareholders shall be entitled to receive payment of
such consideration as may be determined to be due in respect of such Dissenting
Shares held by them in accordance with the provisions of Delaware Law, except
that all Dissenting Shares held by shareholders who effectively shall have
withdrawn or lost their rights to demand appraisal of such Dissenting Shares
under Delaware Law shall thereupon be deemed to have forfeited such appraisal
rights and converted into and to have become exchangeable for, as of the
Effective Time, the right to receive the Merger Consideration, without any
interest thereon, upon surrender, in the manner provided in Section 2.09, of the
certificate or certificates that formerly evidenced such Shares or such shares
of Class A Preferred Stock. The Target shall give Acquiror (i) prompt notice of
any written notice of intent to seek dissenters' rights received by the Target
and (ii) the opportunity to direct all negotiations and proceedings with respect
to any such notices. The Target shall not, without the prior written consent of
Acquiror, voluntarily make any payment with respect to, or settle, offer to
settle, or otherwise negotiate with respect to, any such notices or demands.

         SECTION 2.09. SURRENDER OF SHARES; STOCK TRANSFER BOOKS. (a) Prior to
the Effective Time, Acquiror Sub shall designate a bank or trust company or
other institution reasonably satisfactory to the Target to act as agent (the
"PAYING AGENT") for the holders of Shares and the holders of the shares of Class
A Preferred Stock in connection with the Merger to receive the funds to which

holders of Shares and shares of Class A Preferred Stock shall become entitled
pursuant to Section 2.06(a). At the Effective Time, Acquiror shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to have sufficient funds to deposit, and shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to deposit in trust with the Paying Agent, cash in the
aggregate amount equal to the product of (i) the sum of the number of Shares and
shares of Class A Preferred Stock, that are in each case outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time (other than Shares or shares of Class A Preferred
Stock owned by Acquiror or Acquiror Sub) and (ii) the Per Share Amount. Such
funds shall be invested by the Paying Agent as directed by the Surviving
Corporation, provided that such investments shall be in obligations of or
guaranteed by the United States of America or of any agency thereof and backed
by the full faith and credit of the United States of America, in commercial
paper obligations rated A-1 or P-1 or better by Moody's Investors Services, Inc.
or Standard & Poor's Corporation, respectively, or in deposit accounts,
certificates of deposit or banker's acceptances of, repurchase or reverse
repurchase agreements with, or Eurodollar time deposits purchased from,
commercial banks with capital, surplus and undivided profits aggregating in
excess of $150 million (based on the most recent financial statements of such
bank which are then publicly available at the SEC or otherwise); PROVIDED,
HOWEVER, that no loss on any investment made pursuant to this Section 2.09 shall
relieve Acquiror or the Surviving Corporation of its obligation to pay the Per
Share Amount for each Share outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time.
Any and all interest and earnings on such funds shall be paid to Acquiror.

         (b) Promptly after the Effective Time, Acquiror shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to mail to each person who was, at the Effective Time, a
holder of record of Shares or shares of Class A Preferred Stock entitled to
receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 2.06(a) a form of letter of
transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of
loss and title to the certificates evidencing such Shares or shares of Class A
Preferred Stock (together, the "CERTIFICATES") shall pass, only upon proper
delivery of the Certificates to the Paying Agent) and instructions for use in
effecting the surrender of the Certificates pursuant to such letter of
transmittal. Upon surrender to the Paying Agent of a Certificate, together with
such letter of transmittal, duly completed and validly executed in accordance
with the instructions thereto, and such other documents as may be required
pursuant to such instructions, the holder of such Certificate shall be entitled
to receive in exchange therefor the Merger Consideration for each Share formerly
evidenced by such Certificate, and such Certificate shall then be canceled.
Until surrendered as contemplated by this Section, each Certificate (other than
Certificates representing Dissenting Shares) shall be deemed at any time after
the Effective Time to represent only the right to receive upon such surrender
the amount of cash, without interest, into which the Shares or shares of Class A
Preferred Stock therefore represented by such Certificate shall have been
converted pursuant to Section 2.6. No interest shall accrue or be paid on the
Merger Consideration payable upon the surrender of any Certificate for the
benefit of the holder of such Certificate. If payment of the Merger
Consideration is to be made to a person other than the person in whose name the
surrendered Certificate is registered on the stock transfer books of the Target,
it shall be a condition of payment that the Certificate so surrendered shall be
endorsed properly or otherwise be in proper form for transfer and that the

person requesting such payment shall have paid all transfer and other taxes
required by reason of the payment of the Merger Consideration to a person other
than the registered holder of the Certificate surrendered or shall have
established to the satisfaction of the Surviving Corporation that such taxes
either have been paid or are not applicable. The Surviving Corporation shall pay
all charges and expenses, including those of the Paying Agent, in connection
with the distribution of the Merger Consideration.

         (c) Any portion of the Merger Consideration made available to the
Paying Agent to pay for Shares or shares of Class A Preferred Stock as to which
appraisal rights have been perfected shall be returned to the Surviving
Corporation upon demand. At any time following 6 months after the Effective
Time, the Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to require the Paying Agent to
deliver to it any funds which had been made available to the Paying Agent and
not disbursed to holders of Shares (including, without limitation, all interest
and other income received by the Paying Agent in respect of all funds made
available to it) and, thereafter, such holders shall be entitled to look to the
Surviving Corporation (subject to abandoned property, escheat and other similar
laws) only as general creditors thereof with respect to any Merger Consideration
that may be payable without interest upon due surrender of the Certificates held
by them. Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither the Surviving Corporation nor
the Paying Agent shall be liable to any holder of a Share or a share of Class A
Preferred Stock for any Merger Consideration delivered in respect of such Share
or share of Class A Preferred Stock to a public official pursuant to any
abandoned property, escheat or other similar law. All cash paid upon surrender
of Certificates in accordance with the terms of this Article II shall be deemed
to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the Shares
and the shares of Class A Preferred Stock previously represented by such
Certificates. If any Certificates have not been surrendered prior to three (3)
years after the Effective Date (or prior to such time on which any payment in
respect thereof would otherwise escheat or become the property of any
governmental unit or agency), the payment in respect of such Certificate shall
become the property of the Surviving Corporation free and clear of all liens or
claims or interest of any person previously entitled thereto.

         (d) Acquiror, Acquiror Sub or the Surviving Corporation, as the case
may be, shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration
otherwise payable to any holder of Target Common Stock or Class A Preferred
Stock pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as may be required to be deducted
and withheld with respect to the making of such payment under the Internal
Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or under any provision of state, local or
foreign tax law. If such amounts are withheld, such amounts shall be treated for
all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of the Shares
or shares of Class A Preferred Stock in respect of which the Surviving
Corporation or Acquiror, as applicable, made such deduction and withholding.

         (e) At the close of business on the day of the Effective Time, the
stock transfer books of the Target shall be closed and, thereafter, there shall
be no further registration of transfers of Shares or shares of Class A Preferred
Stock on the records of the Target. From and after the Effective Time, the
holders of Shares or shares of Class A Preferred Stock outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time shall cease to have any rights with respect to such
Shares or shares of class A Preferred Stock except as otherwise provided herein
or by applicable law.

         SECTION 2.10. ADJUSTMENTS. If during the period between the date of
this Agreement and the Effective Time, any change in the outstanding Shares or
shares of Class A Preferred Stock shall occur by reason of any reclassification,
recapitalization, stock dividend, stock split or combination, exchange or
readjustment of Shares or shares of Class A Preferred Stock, or any stock
dividend thereon with a record date during such period, the price per share to
be paid to holders of Shares or shares of Class A Preferred Stock in the Offer,
the Merger Consideration and any other amounts payable pursuant to this
Agreement, as the case may be, shall be appropriately adjusted.

         SECTION 2.11. LOST CERTIFICATES. If any Certificate shall have been
lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the
person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if
required by the Surviving Corporation, the posting by such person of a bond, in
such reasonable amount as the Surviving Corporation may direct, as indemnity
against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such Certificate,
the Paying Agent will pay, in exchange for such affidavit claiming such
Certificate is lost, stolen or destroyed, the Merger Consideration to be paid in
respect to the Shares or the shares of Class A Preferred Stock represented by
such Certificate, as contemplated by this Article II.

                                   ARTICLE III

                  REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE TARGET

         Except as set forth in the Disclosure Schedule delivered by the Target
and signed by the Target and Acquiror for identification prior to the execution
and delivery of this Agreement (the "TARGET DISCLOSURE SCHEDULE"), the Target
hereby represents and warrants to Acquiror and Acquiror Sub that:

         SECTION 3.01. ORGANIZATION AND QUALIFICATION; SUBSIDIARIES. The Target
is a corporation, and each subsidiary of the Target (a "SUBSIDIARY") is a
corporation, in each case duly incorporated and organized, validly existing and
in good standing under the laws of the jurisdiction of its incorporation and has
the requisite corporate power and authority to own, lease and operate its
properties and to carry on its business as it is now being conducted. The Target
and each Subsidiary are duly qualified or licensed as a foreign corporation to
do business, and are in good standing, in each jurisdiction where the character
of the properties owned, leased or operated by them or the nature of their
business makes such qualification or licensing necessary, except for such
failures to be so qualified or licensed and in good standing that would not,
individually or in the aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect on the Target.
As used in this Agreement, the term "Material Adverse Effect" means with respect
to any person, any event, change or effect, individually or together with any
other event, change or effect, that is or is reasonably likely to be materially
adverse (i) to the financial condition, business or results of operations of
such person and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or (ii) the ability of the
Target to perform its obligations under this Agreement or to consummate any of

the Transactions. The following, however, shall not be deemed in themselves,
either alone or in combination, to constitute, a Material Adverse Effect (A) any
change in the market price or trading volume of the Target's Shares after the
date hereof; (B) any adverse change, effect, event, occurrence, state of facts
or developments attributable to or caused by the deterioration in performance of
the Acquiror or its affiliates in its capacity as a customer or supplier of
Target; (C) any adverse change, effect, event, occurrence, state of facts or
developments directly caused by the announcement or pendency of the Offer or the
Merger (including any cancellations of or delays in customer orders, any
reduction in sales, any disruption in supplier, distributor, partner or similar
relationships or any loss of employees); (D) any adverse change, effect, event,
occurrence state of facts or developments directly caused by, resulting from, or
attributable to conditions affecting the technology and space industries
("TARGET INDUSTRIES") as a whole or the United States or world economies as a
whole; and not having a materially disproportionate effect on the Target; (E)
any adverse change, effect, event, occurrence state of facts or developments
resulting from or attributable or relating to out-of-pocket fees and expenses
(including legal, accounting, investment banking and other fees and expenses)
incurred in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; or
(F) any adverse change, effect, event, occurrence state of facts or developments
directly caused by compliance with the terms of, or the taking of any action
required by, this Agreement; and provided further, that with respect to any
dispute regarding whether any adverse change, effect, event, occurrence state of
facts or developments is "directly caused" by any of the foregoing, Acquiror and
Acquiror Sub shall have the burden of proof by a preponderance of the evidence.
As of the date hereof, a true and correct list of all Subsidiaries, together
with the jurisdiction of organization of each Subsidiary and the percentage of
the outstanding capital stock or other equity interests of each Subsidiary owned
by the Target and each other Subsidiary, is set forth in Section 3.01 of the
Target Disclosure Schedule. Except as disclosed in Section 3.01 of the Target
Disclosure Schedule, the Target does not directly or indirectly own any equity
or similar interest in, or any interest convertible into or exchangeable or
exercisable for any equity or similar interest in, any corporation, partnership,
joint venture or other business association or entity.

         SECTION 3.02. CERTIFICATE OF INCORPORATION AND BYLAWS. The Target has
heretofore furnished or made available to Acquiror a complete and correct copy
of the Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws, each as amended to date, of the
Target and each Subsidiary.

         SECTION 3.03. CAPITALIZATION. The authorized capital stock of the
Target consists of 40,000,000 shares of Common Stock, par value $0.01 per share,
and 5,000,000 shares of Preferred Stock, par value $0.01 per share, 700,000
shares of Class A Preferred Stock, par value $0.01 per share and 40,000 shares
of Series B Junior Participating Preferred Stock (the "Series B Preferred
Stock"), (which shares of Series B Preferred Stock are authorized under that
certain Rights Agreement dated as of October 27, 1998, between the Target and
Reliance Trust Company, as amended (the "RIGHTS PLAN")). At March 30, 2001,
6,035,428 shares of Target Common Stock and 15,132 shares of Target Class A
Preferred Stock were issued and outstanding, all of which are validly issued,
fully paid and nonassessable and free of preemptive rights. As of the same date
2,621,797, shares of Target Common Stock were issuable pursuant to outstanding
Options under the Target Option Plans and there are no shares of treasury stock.
Except as set forth in this Section 3.03 or Section 3.03 of the Target
Disclosure Schedule, as of the date of this Agreement, there are no options,
warrants or other rights, agreements, arrangements or commitments of any
character relating to the issued or unissued capital stock of, or other equity
interests in, the Target or any Subsidiary obligating the Target or any
Subsidiary to issue, sell or otherwise transfer any shares of capital stock of,
or other equity interests in, the Target or any Subsidiary. Section 3.03 of the

Target Disclosure Schedule sets forth the holder, date of grant, exercise price
and whether immediately prior to the execution of this Agreement each such
option, warrant or other agreement is vested and exercisable. There are no
outstanding contractual obligations of the Target or any Subsidiary to
repurchase, redeem or otherwise acquire any shares of Target Common Stock or any
capital stock of any Subsidiary. The Target has delivered to Acquiror complete
and correct copies of all option plans and forms of option agreements. Except as
described in Section 3.03 of the Target Disclosure Schedule, each outstanding
share of capital stock of, or other equity interest in, each Subsidiary is duly
authorized, validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable and is owned by the
Target or a wholly-owned Subsidiary free and clear of any lien or other adverse
claim. None of the outstanding shares of capital stock of the Target or any
Subsidiary has been issued in violation of any preemptive rights of the current
or past shareholders of the Target or any of the Subsidiaries.

         SECTION 3.04. AUTHORITY RELATIVE TO THIS AGREEMENT. The Target has all
necessary corporate power and authority to execute and deliver this Agreement
and, with respect to the Merger, and subject, if required under Delaware Law
with respect to the consummation of the Merger, to the approval of the holders
of the Shares and the holders of the Class A Preferred Stock, to consummate the
transactions contemplated hereby. The execution and delivery of this Agreement
by the Target and the consummation by the Target of the Transactions have been
duly and validly authorized by all necessary corporate action and no other
corporate proceedings on the part of the Target are necessary to authorize this
Agreement or to consummate the Transactions (other than, with respect to the
Merger, the approval of this Agreement and the Merger by the Target's
shareholders in accordance with Delaware Law, if required, and the filing and
recordation of appropriate Certificate of Merger with the Secretary in
accordance with this Agreement and Delaware Law). This Agreement has been duly
and validly executed and delivered by the Target and, assuming the due
authorization, execution and delivery of this Agreement by Acquiror and Acquiror
Sub, constitutes a legal, valid and binding obligation of the Target,
enforceable against the Target in accordance with its terms.

         SECTION 3.05. NO CONFLICT; REQUIRED FILINGS AND CONSENTS. (a) The
execution and delivery of this Agreement by the Target do not, and the
performance of this Agreement by the Target will not, subject to (x) with
respect to the Merger, obtaining the requisite approval of this Agreement and
the Merger by the Target's shareholder in accordance with this Agreement and
Delaware Law, and (y) obtaining the consents, approvals, authorizations and
permits and making the filings described in Section 3.05(a) and Section 3.05(b)
of the Target Disclosure Schedule, (i) conflict with or violate the Certificate
of Incorporation or Bylaws of the Target or any Subsidiary, (ii) conflict with
or violate any law applicable to the Target or any Subsidiary or by which any
property or asset of the Target or any Subsidiary is bound or affected, or (iii)
except as specified in Section 3.05(a)(iii) of the Target Disclosure Schedule,
result in any breach of or constitute a default (or an event which with notice
or lapse of time or both would become a default) under, or give to others any
right of termination, unilateral amendment, acceleration or cancellation of, or
result in the creation of a lien or other encumbrance on any property or asset
of the Target or any Subsidiary, or require the consent of any third party
pursuant to, any note, bond, mortgage, indenture, contract, agreement, lease,

license, permit, franchise or other instrument or obligation to which the Target
or any Subsidiary is a party or by which the Target or any Subsidiary or any
property or asset of the Target or any Subsidiary is bound or affected, except
with respect to clause (iii) above for such conflicts, violations, breaches,
defaults or other occurrences which individually or in the aggregate would not
reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on the Target.

         (b) The execution and delivery of this Agreement by the Target do not,
and the performance of this Agreement by the Target will not, require any
consent, approval, authorization or permit of, or filing with or notification
to, any governmental or regulatory authority, domestic or foreign, except (i)
pursuant to the Exchange Act, state securities or "blue sky" laws ("Blue Sky
Laws"), and filing and recordation of appropriate Certificate of Merger with the
Secretary as required by Delaware Law, (ii) as specified in Section 3.05(b) of
the Target Disclosure Schedule and (iii) where failure to obtain such consents,
approvals, authorizations or permits, or to make such filings or notifications,
would not prevent or delay consummation of the Merger, or otherwise prevent the
Target from performing its obligations under this Agreement and would not,
individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material
Adverse Effect.

         SECTION 3.06 PERMITS; COMPLIANCE. Except as disclosed in Section 3.06
of the Target Disclosure Schedule, each of the Target and the Subsidiaries is in
possession of all franchises, grants, authorizations, licenses, permits,
easements, variances, exceptions, consents, certificates, approvals and orders
of any United States (federal, state or local) or foreign government, or
governmental, regulatory or administrative authority, agency or commission or
court of competent jurisdiction ("GOVERNMENTAL AUTHORITY") necessary for the
Target or any Subsidiary to own, lease and operate its properties or to carry on
its business as it is now being conducted, except for those which the failure to
possess would not individually or in the aggregate reasonably be expected to
have a Material Adverse Effect on the Target (the "TARGET PERMITS") and, as of
the date hereof, no suspension or cancellation of any of the Target Permits is
pending or, to the knowledge of the Target, threatened, except such suspensions
or terminations as would not reasonably be expected, individually or in the
aggregate, to have a Material Adverse Effect on the Target. Except as disclosed
in Section 3.06 of the Target Disclosure Schedule or as would not reasonably be
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on the Target, the Target and each
Subsidiary has at all times since January 1, 1996 and is in compliance with all
applicable laws, regulations and orders and neither the Target nor any
Subsidiary is in conflict with, or in default or violation of, or, with the
giving of notice or the passage of time, would be in conflict with, or in
default or violation of, (a) any law applicable to the Target or any Subsidiary
or by which any property or asset of the Target or any Subsidiary is bound or
affected, (b) any of the Target Permits, or (c) any of the provisions of its
Certificate of Incorporation or Bylaws (or other organizational or governing
instruments).

         SECTION 3.07. SEC FILINGS; FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. (a) The Target has
timely filed and previously made available to Acquiror and Acquiror Sub true and
complete copies of all reports, schedules, forms, registration statements and
other documents required to be filed by the Company with the SEC since its
initial public offering (collectively, the "TARGET SEC REPORTS"). The Target SEC
Reports (i) were prepared in all material respects in accordance with the
requirements of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "SECURITIES ACT"),
and the Exchange Act, as the case may be, and the rules and regulations

thereunder and (ii) did not, at the time they were filed (or at the effective
date thereof in the case of registration statements or on the date of mailing in
the case of a proxy statement), contain any untrue statement of a material fact
or omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in
order to make the statements made therein, in the light of the circumstances
under which they were made, not misleading. No Subsidiary is currently required
to file any form, report or other document with the SEC under Section 12 of the
Exchange Act.

         (b) Each of the financial statements (including, in each case, any
notes thereto) contained in the Target SEC Reports was prepared in accordance
with United States generally accepted accounting principles applied on a
consistent basis ("U.S. GAAP") throughout the periods indicated (except as may
be indicated in the notes thereto and except that financial statements included
with interim reports do not contain all U.S. GAAP notes to such financial
statements) and each fairly presented in all material respects the financial
position, results of operations and changes in shareholders' equity and cash
flows of the Target as at the respective dates thereof and for the respective
periods indicated therein (subject, in the case of unaudited statements, to
normal and recurring year-end adjustments which were not and are not expected,
individually or in the aggregate, to be material in amount or effect).

         (c) Except (i) to the extent set forth on the balance sheet of the
Target and the consolidated Subsidiaries as at December 31, 2001 including the
notes thereto, (ii) as set forth in Section 3.07(c) of the Target Disclosure
Schedule or (iii) as disclosed in any SEC Report filed by the Target after
December 31, 2001, and prior to the date of this Agreement, neither the Target
nor any Subsidiary has any liability or obligation of any nature (whether
accrued, absolute, contingent or otherwise) that is reasonably likely to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on the Target,
except for liabilities and obligations incurred in the ordinary course of
business consistent with past practice since December 31, 2001, which would not,
individually or in the aggregate, be reasonably expected to have a Material
Adverse Effect on the Target.

         SECTION 3.08. ABSENCE OF CERTAIN CHANGES OR EVENTS. Except as
contemplated by, or disclosed pursuant to this Agreement, including Section 3.08
of the Target Disclosure Schedule, or disclosed in any Target SEC Report filed
prior to the date of this Agreement, the Target and the Subsidiaries have
conducted their business only in the ordinary course and in a manner consistent
with past practice and, since December 31, 2000, there has not been (a) any
event or events (whether or not covered by insurance), changes or occurrences
that have had, or are reasonably likely to have, individually or in the
aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on the Target, (b) any material change by
the Target in its tax or accounting methods, principles or practices, or systems
of internal accounting controls, except as may be appropriate to conform to
changes in the tax laws or U.S. GAAP, (c) any entry by the Target or any
Subsidiary into any commitment or transaction, except in the ordinary course of
business and consistent with past practice or current industry conditions, (d)
any declaration, setting aside or payment of any dividend or distribution in
respect of any capital stock of the Target or any redemption, purchase or other
acquisition or exchange of any shares, or securities convertible into any

shares, of the capital stock of the Target or a Subsidiary, (e) any increase in
or establishment of any bonus, insurance, severance, deferred compensation,
pension, retirement, profit sharing, stock option, stock purchase or other
employee benefit plan, except in the ordinary course of business consistent with
past practice or as required pursuant to the terms of the Plans (as defined in
Section 3.10), (f) any granting by the Target or any of its Subsidiaries to any
director, employee or officer of the Target or any of its Subsidiaries of any
increases in compensation, severance or termination pay except in the ordinary
course of business consistent with past practice or any entry by the Target or
any of its Subsidiaries into any employment, severance or termination agreement
with any such director, employee or officer, or (g) incurrence of any additional
debt obligations or other obligations for borrowed money (other than
indebtedness of a Subsidiary to the Target or another Subsidiary) in excess of
an aggregate of $1,000,000 except in the ordinary course of the business of the
Target consistent with past practices.

         SECTION 3.09. ABSENCE OF LITIGATION. Except as disclosed in Section
3.09 of the Target Disclosure Schedule, there is no claim, action, proceeding or
investigation pending against the Target or any Subsidiary or, to the best
knowledge of the Target or any of the Subsidiaries threatened against the Target
or any Subsidiary, or to the best knowledge of Target or any Subsidiary
threatened or pending against any employee or director for which the Target or a
Subsidiary may be liable or against any property, asset, interest or right of
any of them, before any arbitrator or Governmental Authority which (a)
individually or in the aggregate, could reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect on the Target or (b) seeks to and is reasonably likely
to significantly delay or prevent the consummation of the Offer or the Merger.
Neither the Target nor any Subsidiary nor any property or asset of the Target or
any Subsidiary is in violation of any order, writ, judgment, injunction, decree,
determination or award having, individually or in the aggregate, a Material
Adverse Effect on the Target. All existing litigation to which the Target or any
Subsidiary is a party as of the date hereof is listed on Schedule 3.09 of the
Target Disclosure Schedule.

         SECTION 3.10. EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS. (a) Section 3.10 of the Target
Disclosure Schedule lists (a) all employee benefit plans, programs and
arrangements described in Section 3(3) of the Employee Retirement Income
Security Act of 1974, as amended ("ERISA") and all other material employee
benefit plans, programs and arrangements, currently contributed to or maintained
for the benefit of any current or former employee, officer or director of the
Target or any Subsidiary (the "PLANS") and (b) all written contracts and
agreements relating to employment and all severance or change of control
agreements with any of the directors, officers or employees of the Target or any
Subsidiary (other than, in each case, any such contract or agreement that is
terminable by the Target or any Subsidiary at will without penalty or other
adverse consequence) (the "TARGET EMPLOYMENT CONTRACTS"). Section 3.10 of the
Target Disclosure Schedule sets forth the name of each officer or employee of
the Target or any Subsidiary with an annual base compensation greater than
$100,000 and the annual base compensation applicable to each such officer or
employee. The Target has made available to Acquiror a copy, if any, of each
Plan, each material document prepared in connection with each Plan and each
Target Employment Contract. None of the Plans is a multiemployer plan within the
meaning of Section 3(37) of ERISA. Except as set forth in Section 3.10 of the
Target Disclosure Schedule, each Plan has been operated in accordance with its
terms and the requirements of applicable law except where the failure to so

operate would not have a Material Adverse Effect on the Target. The Target does
not currently have any direct or indirect material liability under, arising out
of or by operation of Title IV of ERISA in connection with the termination of,
or withdrawal from, any Plan or other retirement plan or arrangement and, as of
the date hereof, no fact exists or event has occurred that would reasonably be
expected to give rise to any such liability.

         (b) Neither the Target nor any Subsidiary has any liability to the
Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation ("PBGC") other than routine premium costs,
nor has there been any application for waiver or waiver of the minimum funding
standards imposed by Section 412 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as
amended (the "Code") and except as set forth in Section 3.10 of the Target
Disclosure Schedule, no "accumulated funding deficiency" within the meaning of
Section 412(a) of the Code exists (whether or not waived) with respect to any
Plan. Except as set forth in Section 3.10 of the Target Disclosure Schedule, no
Plan has any material unfunded accrued benefits as determined per U.S. GAAP that
are not fully reflected in the Target financial statements.

         (c) Except as set forth in Section 3.10 of the Target Disclosure
Schedule, the Target and any applicable Subsidiary have made full and timely
payment of all amounts required under the terms of each of the Plans that are
employee pension benefit plans as defined in Section 3(2) of ERISA.

         (d) Each Plan that is intended to qualify under section 401(a) of the
Code has received a determination from the Internal Revenue Service stating that
it so qualifies and that its trust is exempt from taxation under section 501(a)
of the Code and, except as set forth in Section 3.10 of the Target Disclosure
Schedule, nothing has occurred since the date of such determination that could
materially adversely affect such qualification or exempt status.

         (e) Except as set forth in Section 3.10 of the Target Disclosure
Schedule, no breaches of fiduciary duty have occurred with respect to any Plan
that might reasonably be expected to give rise to material liability and no
prohibited transaction (within the meaning of Section 406 of ERISA or section
4975 of the Code) has occurred with respect to any Plan that gives rise to or
might reasonably be expected to give rise to material liability.

         (f) Except as set forth in Section 3.10 of the Target Disclosure
Schedule, no Plan that is a "welfare plan" as defined in Section 3(1) of ERISA
provides medical or death benefits with respect to current or former employees
of the Target or any Subsidiary beyond their termination of employment (other
than to the extent required by applicable law).

         (g) The Target and all Subsidiaries have complied in material respects
with the continuation coverage requirements of Title X of the Consolidated
Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985, as amended ("COBRA").

         (h) Except as set forth in Section 3.10 of the Target Disclosure
Schedule, each Plan can be amended or terminated at any time (subject to any
applicable advance notice provision) and without material liability to the
Target other than for benefits accrued prior to such amendment or termination.
Except as set forth in Section 3.10 of the Target Disclosure Schedule, or as
contemplated by this Agreement, no agreement, commitment, or obligation exists
to increase any benefits under any Plan or to adopt any new Plan.

         (i) Except as set forth in Section 3.10 of the Target Disclosure
Schedule, there are no material claims, lawsuits, or arbitrations pending or, to
the best knowledge of the Target or any of the Subsidiaries, threatened
involving any Plan (other than routine claims for benefits) nor is there any
reasonable basis to anticipate any such claims, lawsuits, or arbitrations
involving any Plans.

         SECTION 3.11. LABOR MATTERS. (a) Except as set forth in Section 3.11(a)
of the Target Disclosure Schedule, neither the Target nor any Subsidiary is a
party to, nor does it have any obligation pursuant to, any material oral and
legally binding or written agreement, collective bargaining or otherwise, with
any party regarding the rates of pay or working conditions of any of its
employees, and, except as set forth in Section 3.11(a) of the Target Disclosure
Schedule is obligated under any agreement to recognize or bargain with any labor
organization or union on behalf of its employees.

         (b) Except as set forth in Section 3.11(b) of the Target Disclosure
Schedule, the Target and each Subsidiary is in compliance with all applicable
federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations concerning the
employer-employee relationship and with all agreements relating to the
employment of its employees, including, but not limited to, applicable wage and
hour laws, immigration laws, fair employment laws, safety laws, worker
compensation statutes, unemployment laws and social security laws, except for
such non-compliance as would not have a Material Adverse Effect on the Target
and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole. Neither the Target nor any of its
Subsidiaries is the subject of any litigation asserting that it has committed an
unfair labor practice within the meaning of the National Labor Relations Act or
comparable foreign, state or local law or seeking to compel the Target or any of
its Subsidiaries to bargain with any labor organization as to wages or
conditions of employment. There is no strike or material labor dispute involving
the Target or any Subsidiary pending or, to the knowledge of the Target or any
of the Subsidiaries, threatened.

         SECTION 3.12. TAXES. (a) Except as set forth in Section 3.12 of the
Target Disclosure Schedule, the Target and each of the Subsidiaries have timely
(i) filed all federal, state, local and foreign tax returns required to be filed
by them prior to the date of this Agreement (taking into account extensions),
and all tax returns filed are accurate and complete in all material respects,
(ii) paid or accrued all taxes shown to be due on such returns and paid all
applicable ad valorem and value added taxes as are due and (iii) paid or accrued
all taxes for which a notice of assessment or collection has been received
(other than amounts being contested in good faith by appropriate proceedings).
Except as set forth in Section 3.12 of the Target Disclosure Schedule, neither
the Internal Revenue Service nor any other federal, state, local or foreign
taxing authority has asserted any claim for taxes, or to the best knowledge of
the Target and each of the Subsidiaries, is threatening to assert any claims for
taxes, which claims, individually or in the aggregate, could have a Material
Adverse Effect on the Target. The Target and each Subsidiary has open years for
federal, state and foreign tax returns only as set forth in Section 3.12 of the
Target Disclosure Schedule. The Target and each Subsidiary have, withheld or
collected, and timely paid over to the appropriate governmental authorities (or

are properly holding for such payment) all taxes required by law to be withheld
or collected, except for amounts which would not, individually or in the
aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect on the Target. Neither the Target nor
any of the Subsidiaries has made an election under Section 341(f) of the Code.
There are no liens for taxes upon the assets of the Target or any Subsidiary
(other than liens for taxes that are not yet due or that are being contested in
good faith by appropriate proceedings), except for liens which would not,
individually or in the aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect on the Target.
Except as set forth in Section 3.12 of the Target Disclosure Schedule, neither
the Target nor any of the Subsidiaries has or has had a permanent establishment
in any foreign country, as defined in any applicable tax treaty or convention
between the United States and such foreign country.

         (b) Except as set forth in Section 3.12 of the Target Disclosure
Schedules, neither the Target or any Subsidiary has executed an extension or
waiver of any statute of limitations on the assessment or collection of any tax
due (excluding such statutes that relate to years currently under examination by
the Internal Revenue Service or other applicable taxing authorities) that is
currently in effect.

         (c) The provision for any taxes due or to become due for the Target or
any Subsidiary for the period or periods through and including the date of the
Target financial statements filed in the most recent Target SEC Report that has
been made and is reflected on such financial statements is sufficient to cover
all such taxes in all material respects.

         (d) The Target and each Subsidiary is in compliance with, and its
records contain all information and documents (including properly completed IRS
Forms W-9) necessary to comply with, all applicable information reporting and
tax withholding requirements under federal, foreign, state, and local tax laws,
and such records identify with specificity all accounts subject to backup
withholding under Section 3406 of the Code, except for such instances of
noncompliance and such omissions as are not reasonably likely to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on Target.

any Governmental Authority or the requirements of any Environmental Law; and
(viii) there are no pending or, to the knowledge of the Target, past or

the best knowledge of Target there are no circumstances that can reasonably be
expected to form the basis of any such Environmental Claim, including without
limitation with respect to any off-site disposal location presently or formerly
used by the Target or any of the Subsidiaries.

         (c) The Target and the Subsidiaries have made available to Acquiror
copies of any environmental reports, studies or analyses in its possession or

Directors has received the opinion of Target Banker, dated the date of this

financial point of view, to such holders (other than Acquiror and its
affiliates).

         SECTION 3.15. BROKERS. No broker, finder or investment banker (other
than Target Banker) is entitled to any brokerage, finders or other fee or
commission in connection with the Transactions based upon arrangements made by

furnished to Acquiror a correct copy of all agreements between the Target and
Target Banker pursuant to which such firm would be entitled to any payment
relating to the Transactions.

currently expected to result in the payment or receipt by the Target or any
Subsidiary of more than $100,000 and which is not terminable by the Target or
any Subsidiary without the payment of any penalty or fine on not more than three
months' notice (a "MATERIAL CONTRACT") to which the Target or any Subsidiary is
a party, other than contracts which have been filed as an exhibit to or have
been incorporated by reference in any Target SEC Report. Each Material Contract
is in full force and effect and is enforceable against the parties thereto
(other than the Target) in accordance with its terms, and no condition or state
of facts exists that, with notice or the passage of time, or both, would
constitute a material default by the Target or, to the knowledge of the Target,
any third party under such Material Contracts. The Target has duly complied in
all material respects with the provisions of each Material Contract to which it
is a party.

which, since August 1, 2000, has resulted in a government contracting officer's
determination and finding final decision where the amount in controversy exceeds
or is expected to exceed $100,000, or (v) no claim or equitable adjustment by
the Target or any of its subsidiaries against the U.S. Government in excess of
$100,000.

         (c) For the purposes of this Agreement, with respect to any party,
"GOVERNMENT CONTRACT" means any material prime contract, subcontract, teaming
agreement or arrangement, joint venture, basic ordering agreement, letter

material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the
statements made therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they are
made, not misleading, except that no representation or warranty is made by the
Target with respect to information supplied by Acquiror Sub or Acquiror for
inclusion in the Schedule 14D-9. The Schedule 14D-9 shall comply in all material
respects as to form with the requirements of the Exchange Act and the rules and
regulations thereunder.

         SECTION 3.18. DELAWARE LAW SECTION 203; STATE TAKEOVER LAWS. On or
prior to the date hereof, the Target and each Subsidiary has taken all necessary

(a "LEASE") to cancel or terminate the same (nor has the Target canceled or
terminated any Lease), nor has the Target vacated all or any portion of such

under any Lease; except as set forth in Section 3.20 of the Target Disclosure
Schedule (i) no Lease has been modified, altered or amended in any respect, (ii)
no condition presently exists which would give any lessor the right to cancel or
terminate its Lease and (iii) the Target has no interest in real property other
than the leasehold possessory interest set forth in such Lease; and each of the
Leases is valid and subsisting in full force and effect in accordance with its
terms and constitutes the legal, valid, binding and enforceable obligation of
the lessor thereunder.

         SECTION 3.21. INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY. (a) Section 3.21 of the Target
Disclosure Schedule sets forth a true and complete list of (i) all United States

patent applications, trademarks, trademark registrations and applications, trade
names, service marks, and copyright registrations and applications therefore and
trade secrets licensed to the Target or any of its Subsidiaries (the "LICENSED
RIGHTS").

         (b) Except as set forth in Section 3.21 of the Target's Disclosure
Schedule or except to the extent that the inaccuracy of any of the following (or
the circumstances giving rise to such inaccuracy) could not reasonably be
expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect.

         (i)      (A) the Intellectual Property Rights are free and clear of any
                  Encumbrances including Government Purpose Rights and or
                  Unlimited Rights as defined in the Federal Acquisition
                  Regulation ("FAR") or the Defense Federal Acquisition
                  Regulation ("DFAR"), are not subject to any license (royalty
                  bearing or royalty free) and are not subject to any other
                  agreement requiring any payment to any person or the
                  obligation to grant rights to any person in exchange; and (B)
                  the Licensed Rights are free and clear of any Encumbrances.

         (ii)     To the knowledge of the Target, the validity of the
                  Intellectual Property Rights and title thereto, and the
                  validity of the Licensed Rights, (A) have not been overturned
                  in any prior litigation; and (B) are not being questioned in
                  any pending litigation.

         (iii)    The consummation of the Transaction contemplated hereby will
                  not result in the loss of any Intellectual Property Rights or
                  any of the Licensed Rights.

         (c) Each of the Target and its Subsidiaries owns, or possesses valid
license rights to, all computer software programs that are material to the
conduct of the business of the Target and its Subsidiaries, except to the extent
that the failure thereof could not reasonably be expected to have, individually
or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect and that all material computer
software programs are "commercial computer software" in accordance with the
FAR/DFAR.

         (d) The use of the Intellectual Property Rights does not to the
knowledge of Target conflict with or violate or infringe any intellectual
property rights or (including patents) of any other person except to the extent
that such conflict or violation would not reasonably be expected to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect.

         SECTION 3.22. VOTE REQUIRED. The only votes of the holders of any class
or series of the Target's capital stock, if any, necessary to approve the Merger
is the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the issued and
outstanding shares of the Target's capital stock.

         SECTION 3.23. AMENDMENT TO THE TARGET'S RIGHTS PLAN. The board of
directors of the Target has taken all necessary action (including any amendment
thereof) under the Rights Plan (without redeeming the Rights) so that none of
the execution or delivery of this Agreement, the making or consummation of the
Offer (including the acquisition of Shares pursuant to the Offer under this
Agreement), the consummation of the Merger or the Voting and Tender Agreement or
any other transaction contemplated hereby or thereby will cause (i) the Rights
to become exercisable under the Rights Plan or to separate from the stock
certificates to which they are attached, (ii) an Acquisition Date (as defined in
the Rights Plan) to occur, or (iii) Acquiror, Acquiror Sub or any of their
affiliates to be deemed an Acquiring Person (as defined in the Rights Plan); and
(b) the Rights Plan will expire immediately prior to the Effective Time; and the
Rights Plan, as so amended, has not been further amended or modified. The Target
has furnished Parent with complete and correct copies of all such actions of the
board of directors of the Target.

LEASES; CONDITION TO FACILITIES AND MACHINERY AND EQUIPMENT. (a) Except as
described in Section 3.24 of the Target Disclosure Schedule, the Target and the
Subsidiaries have good and saleable title to all their tangible properties and
assets free and clear of all liens, other than (i) statutory liens not yet
delinquent, or (ii) such imperfections or irregularities of title, liens,
easements, charges or encumbrances as do not individually or in the aggregate
would have a Material Adverse Effect on the Target. All material tangible
properties used in the businesses of the Target and the Subsidiaries are in
working condition, reasonable wear and tear excepted, and are usable in the
ordinary course of business consistent with past practice.

         (b) The accounts receivable of the Target and the Subsidiaries as set
forth on the most recent balance sheet included in the Target financial
statements contained in the Target SEC Reports prior to the date of this

collection losses on such balance sheet has been determined in accordance with
U.S. GAAP.

assets required to operate the business of the Target and the Subsidiaries as
presently conducted.

         SECTION 3.25. ABSENCE OF SENSITIVE PAYMENTS. To the knowledge of the
Target, none of the Target, any of its Subsidiaries or affiliates or any officer
or director of any of them, acting alone or together, has performed any of the
following acts: (i) the making of any contribution, payment, remuneration, gift
or other form of economic benefit (a "PAYMENT") to or for the private use of any
governmental official, employee or agent where the Payment or the purpose of the
Payment was illegal under the laws of the United States or the jurisdiction in
which such payment was made, or (ii) the establishment or maintenance of any
unrecorded fund, asset or liability for any purpose or the making of any false
or artificial entries on its books.

         SECTION 3.26 CHANGE OF CONTROL. Except as set forth in Section 3.26 or
Section 3.10 of the Target Disclosure Schedule, the Target is not a party to any
Material Contract that contains a "change in control," "potential change in
control" or similar provision, which, as a result of the consummation of the

Transactions will (either alone or upon the occurrence of any additional acts or
events) result in any payment (whether severance pay or otherwise) becoming due
from the Target to any person, or the acceleration, termination or modification
of any obligations, rights, or contracts under such Material Contract.

         SECTION 3.27 CERTAIN MATTERS. Notwithstanding any other representation
or disclosure set forth herein or in the Target Disclosure Schedule, the matter
listed on Section 3.27 of the Target Disclosure Schedule is not reasonably
likely to result in a Material Adverse Effect on the Target.

                            ACQUIROR AND ACQUIROR SUB

         Acquiror and Acquiror Sub hereby, jointly and severally, represent and

Acquiror and Acquiror Sub is a corporation duly organized, validly existing and
in good standing under the laws of the jurisdiction of its incorporation and has
the requisite corporate power and authority and all necessary governmental
approvals to own, lease and operate its properties and to carry on its business
as it is now being conducted, except where the failure to have such power,
authority and governmental approvals would not, individually or in the
aggregate, have a material adverse effect on the ability of Acquiror and
Acquiror Sub to perform their obligations hereunder and to consummate the
Transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

         SECTION 4.02. AUTHORITY RELATIVE TO THIS AGREEMENT. Each of Acquiror
and Acquiror Sub has all necessary corporate power and authority to execute and
deliver this Agreement and all other ancillary agreements, to perform its
obligations hereunder and to consummate the Transactions. The execution and
delivery of this Agreement by Acquiror and Acquiror Sub and the consummation by
Acquiror and Acquiror Sub of the Transactions have been duly and validly
authorized by all necessary corporate action and no other corporate proceedings
(including board approvals and votes by shareholders, if necessary) on the part
of Acquiror or Acquiror Sub are necessary to authorize this Agreement or to
consummate the Transactions (other than with respect to the Merger, the filing
and recordation of appropriate Certificate of Merger with the Secretary, as
required by this Agreement and Delaware Law). This Agreement has been duly and
validly executed and delivered by Acquiror and Acquiror Sub and, assuming the
due authorization, execution and delivery of this Agreement by the Target,
constitutes a legal, valid and binding obligation of each of Acquiror and
Acquiror Sub enforceable against each of Acquiror and Acquiror Sub in accordance
with its terms.

         SECTION 4.03. NO CONFLICT; REQUIRED FILINGS AND CONSENTS. (a) The

Certificate of Incorporation or Bylaws of either Acquiror or Acquiror Sub, (ii)
conflict with or violate any law applicable to Acquiror or Acquiror Sub or by
which any property or asset of either of them is bound or affected, or (iii)
result in any breach of or constitute a default (or an event which with notice
or lapse of time or both would become a default) under, or give to others any
rights of termination, amendment, acceleration or cancellation of, or result in
the creation of a lien or other encumbrance on any property or asset of Acquiror
or Acquiror Sub or require the consent of any third party pursuant to, any note,
bond, mortgage, indenture, contract, agreement, lease, license, permit,
franchise or other instrument or obligation material to it to which Acquiror or
Acquiror Sub is a party or by which Acquiror or Acquiror Sub or any property or
asset of any of them is bound or affected, except for any such conflicts,
violations, breaches, defaults or other occurrences which would not,
individually or in the aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect on Acquiror or
prevent Acquiror and Acquiror Sub from performing their respective obligations
under this Agreement and consummating the Transactions.

         (b) The execution and delivery of this Agreement by Acquiror and
Acquiror Sub do not, and the performance of this Agreement by Acquiror and
Acquiror Sub will not require any consent, approval, authorization or permit of,
or filing with or notification to, any governmental or regulatory authority,
domestic or foreign, except (i) pursuant to the Exchange Act, Blue Sky Laws, the
HSR Act and filing and recordation of appropriate Certificate of Merger with the
Secretary as required by this Agreement and Delaware Law and (ii) where failure
to obtain such consents, approvals, authorizations or permits, or to make such
filings or notifications, would not have a Material Adverse Effect on Acquiror
and would not prevent or delay consummation of the Transactions, or otherwise
prevent Acquiror or Acquiror Sub from performing their respective obligations
under this Agreement.

         SECTION 4.04. OFFER DOCUMENTS; PROXY STATEMENT. The Offer Documents
will not, at the time the Offer Documents are filed with the SEC or are first
published, sent or given to shareholders of the Target, as the case may be,
contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material

statement to be sent to the shareholders of the Target in connection with the
Target Shareholders Meeting (such proxy statement, as amended and supplemented,
being referred to herein as the "PROXY STATEMENT") and Schedule 14D-9 will not,
on the date the Proxy Statement or Schedule 14D-9 (or any amendment or
supplement thereto) is first mailed to shareholders of the Target, at the time
of the Shareholders Meeting and at the Effective Time, contain any statement
which, at such time and in light of the circumstances under which it is made, is
false or misleading with respect to any material fact, or omits to state any
material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the
statements therein not false or misleading or necessary to correct any statement
in any earlier communication with respect to the solicitation of proxies for the
Target Shareholders Meeting which shall have become false or misleading;
PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that Acquiror or Acquiror Sub makes no representation or
warranty with respect to information supplied by the Target for inclusion in the
Offer Documents. The Offer Documents shall comply in all material respects as to

form with the requirements of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations
thereunder. If at any time prior to the Effective Time either Acquiror or

         SECTION 6.01. SHAREHOLDERS' MEETING. (a) If required by applicable law
in order to consummate the Merger, the Target shall, in accordance with
applicable law and the Target's Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws, (a)
duly call, give notice of, convene and hold an annual or special meeting of its
shareholders as soon as practicable following consummation of the Offer for the
purpose of considering and taking action on this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby (the "TARGET SHAREHOLDERS MEETING") and (b) subject to the
fiduciary obligations of the Target's Board of Directors as advised by
independent legal counsel, include in the Proxy Statement the recommendation of
the Target's Board of Directors that the shareholders of the Target approve this
Agreement and the Transactions, including, without limitation, the Merger and
use its reasonable best efforts to obtain such approval. To the extent permitted
by law, Acquiror and Acquiror Sub each agree to vote all Shares beneficially
owned by them in favor of the Merger.

         (b) Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 6.01(a), in the event
that Acquiror and Acquiror Sub shall acquire in the aggregate at least 90% of
the outstanding Shares and at least 90% of the then outstanding shares of Class
A Preferred Stock, if any, pursuant to the Offer or otherwise, the parties
hereto shall, at the request of Acquiror, take all necessary and appropriate
action to cause the Merger to become effective as soon as practicable after such
acquisition, without a meeting of shareholders of the Target, in accordance with
Delaware Law.

         SECTION 6.02. PROXY STATEMENT. If required by applicable law in order
to consummate the Merger, as promptly as practicable after the purchase of all
Shares validly tendered and not withdrawn pursuant to the Offer, the Target
shall file the Proxy Statement with the SEC under the Exchange Act, and shall
use its reasonable best efforts to have the Proxy Statement cleared by the SEC.
Acquiror, Acquiror Sub and the Target shall cooperate with each other in the
preparation of the Proxy Statement, and the Target shall notify Acquiror of the
receipt of any comments of the SEC with respect to the Proxy Statement and of
any requests by the SEC for any amendment or supplement thereto or for
additional information and shall provide to Acquiror promptly copies of all
correspondence between the Target or any representative of the Target and the
SEC. The Target shall give Acquiror and its counsel the opportunity to review
the Proxy Statement prior to its being filed with the SEC and shall give
Acquiror and its counsel the opportunity to review all amendments and
supplements to the Proxy Statement and all responses to requests for additional
information and replies to comments prior to their being filed with, or sent to,
the SEC. Each of the Target, Acquiror and Acquiror Sub agrees to use its
reasonable best efforts, after consultation with the other parties hereto, to
respond promptly to all such comments of and requests by the SEC and to cause
the Proxy Statement and all required amendments and supplements thereto to be
mailed to the holders of Shares entitled to vote at the Target Shareholders
Meeting at the earliest practicable time with the intent being to complete the
Merger as soon as practicable.

         SECTION 6.03. TARGET BOARD REPRESENTATION; SECTION 14(F). (a) Promptly
upon the purchase by Acquiror Sub of Shares pursuant to the Offer following
attainment of the Minimum Condition, and from time to time thereafter, Acquiror
Sub shall be entitled to designate up to such number of directors, rounded up to
the next whole number, on the Target's Board of Directors as shall give Acquiror
Sub representation on the Target's Board of Directors equal to the product of
the total number of directors on the Target's Board of Directors (giving effect
to the directors elected pursuant to this sentence) multiplied by the percentage

that the aggregate number of Shares beneficially owned by Acquiror Sub or any
affiliate of Acquiror Sub at such time bears to the total number of Shares then
outstanding, and the Target shall, at such time, promptly take all actions
necessary to cause Acquiror Sub's designees to be elected as directors of the
Target, including increasing the size of the Target's Board of Directors or
securing the resignations of incumbent directors or both. At such times, the
Target shall use its best efforts to cause persons designated by Acquiror Sub to
constitute the same percentage as persons designated by Acquiror Sub shall
constitute of the Target's Board of Directors of (i) each committee of the
Target's Board of Directors (some of whom may be required to be independent as
required by applicable law), (ii) each board of directors of each domestic
Subsidiary and (iii) each committee of each such board, in each case only to the
extent permitted by applicable law. Notwithstanding the foregoing, until the
time Acquiror Sub acquires a majority of the then outstanding Shares, the Target
shall use reasonable efforts to ensure that all the members of the Target's
Board of Directors and each committee of the Target's Board of Directors and
such boards and committees of the domestic Subsidiaries as of the date hereof
who are not employees of the Target shall remain members of the Target's Board
of Directors and of such boards and committees pursuant to the terms of their
office.

         (b) The Target shall promptly take all actions required pursuant to
Section 14(f) of the Exchange Act and Rule 14f-1 promulgated thereunder in order
to fulfill its obligations under this Section 6.03 and shall include in the
Schedule 14D-9 such information with respect to the Target and its officers and
directors as is required under Section 14(f) and Rule 14f-1 to fulfill such
obligations. Acquiror or Acquiror Sub shall supply to the Target and be solely
responsible for any information with respect to either of them and their
nominees, officers, directors and affiliates required by such Section 14(f) and
Rule 14f-1.

         (c) Following the election or appointment of designees of Acquiror Sub
pursuant to this Section 6.03, prior to the Effective Time, any amendment of
this Agreement or the Certificate of Incorporation or Bylaws of the Target, any
termination of this Agreement by the Target, any extension by the Target of the
time for the performance of any of the obligations or other acts of Acquiror or
Acquiror Sub or waiver of any of the Target's rights hereunder shall require the
concurrence of a majority of the directors of the Target then in office who
neither were designated by Acquiror Sub nor are employees of the Target or if no
such directors are then in office, no such amendment, termination, extension or
waiver shall be effected which is materially adverse to the holders of Shares or
the holders of the Class A Preferred Stock (other than Acquiror and its
subsidiaries).

         SECTION 6.04. ACCESS TO INFORMATION; CONFIDENTIALITY. Subject to the
Confidentiality Agreement (as hereinafter defined), from the date hereof to
Acquiror Sub's Election Date, the Target will provide Acquiror, during normal
business hours and upon reasonable notice, access to all financial, operating
and other data and information regarding the business of the Target as Acquiror
reasonably requests, other than information and documents that in the opinion of
Target's counsel may not be disclosed under applicable law. No investigation
pursuant to this Section shall affect any representation or warranty in this
Agreement of any party hereto or any condition to the obligations of the parties
hereto.

         SECTION 6.05.  NO SOLICITATION OF TRANSACTIONS.

         (a) Target shall not, directly or indirectly, through any officer,
director, employee, agent or otherwise and shall not permit any Subsidiary or
any officer, director, employee or agent to, solicit, initiate or encourage the
submission of any proposal or offer from any person relating to any acquisition
or purchase of all or any material portion of the assets of, or any equity
interest in, the Target or any Subsidiary or any merger, consolidation, share
exchange, business combination or other similar transaction with the Target or
any Subsidiary (a "BUSINESS COMBINATION PROPOSAL") or participate in any
negotiations regarding, or furnish or make available to any other person any
information with respect to, or otherwise cooperate in any way with, or assist
or participate in, facilitate or encourage, any effort or attempt by any other
person to do or seek or provide access to the properties, books or records of
Target or any Subsidiary to any person in connection with, any of the foregoing;
PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that nothing contained in this Section 6.05 shall prohibit
the Target from complying with Rule 14e-2 and Rule 14d-9 under the Exchange Act
or furnishing information to, or entering into discussions or negotiations with
or providing access to the properties, books or records of Target or any
Subsidiary to any person in connection with an unsolicited Business Combination
Proposal by such person received by the Target after the date of the Agreement,
if, and only to the extent that, (a) a majority of the disinterested members of
the Target's Board of Directors, after consultation with Target's independent
financial advisor and based on the advice of outside counsel, determines in good
faith that such action is required in order for the Target's Board of Directors
not to breach its fiduciary duties to shareholders imposed by law and (b) prior
to furnishing such information to, or entering into discussions or negotiations
with, such person, the Target (i) gives Acquiror as promptly as practicable
prior written notice of the Target's intention to furnish such information or
begin such discussions, the identity of such person and the material terms of
such Business Combination Proposal and (ii) receives from such person an
executed confidentiality agreement on terms no less favorable to the Target than
those contained in the Confidentiality Agreement. The Target shall keep Acquiror
informed of the material details of any such Business Combination Proposal or
any significant indication of interest in making any Business Combination
Proposal as promptly as practicable. The Target agrees not to release any third
party from, or waive any provision of, any confidentiality or standstill
agreement to which the Target is a party. The Target immediately shall cease and
cause to be terminated all existing discussions or negotiations with any parties
conducted heretofore with respect to any of the foregoing.

         (b) Neither the Board of Directors of Target nor any committee thereof
shall (i) withdraw or modify, or propose to withdraw or modify, in a manner
adverse to Acquiror or Acquiror Sub, the approval or recommendation by such
Board of Directors or any such committee of the Offer, this Agreement or the
Merger or (ii) approve or recommend, or propose to approve or recommend, any
Business Combination Proposal. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Board of
Directors of Target, to the extent required by the fiduciary obligations
thereof, as determined in good faith by a majority of the disinterested members
thereof based on the advice of outside counsel, may approve or recommend (and,
in connection therewith, withdraw or modify its approval or recommendation of
the Offer, this Agreement and the Merger) a Superior Proposal. For purposes of
this Agreement, "SUPERIOR PROPOSAL" means a bona fide Business Combination
Proposal made by a third party to acquire, directly or indirectly, more than

fifty percent 50% of the Shares then outstanding or all or a material portion of
the assets of Target and its subsidiaries and otherwise on terms that a majority
of the disinterested members of the Board of Directors of Target determines in
its good faith judgment (after consultation with the Target's independent
financial advisor) to be more favorable to the holders of Shares than the Offer
and the Merger from a financial perspective and for which financing, to the
extent required, is then committed or which, in the good faith judgment of a
majority of such disinterested members (after consultation with Target's
independent financial advisor, is reasonably likely to be financed by such third
party.

         SECTION 6.06. DIRECTORS' AND OFFICERS' INDEMNIFICATION. (a) The
Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation shall
contain provisions no less favorable with respect to indemnification than are
set forth in the Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws of the Target, which
provisions shall not be amended, repealed or otherwise modified for a period of
six (6) years from the Effective Time in any manner that would affect adversely
the rights thereunder of individuals who at any time prior to the Effective Time
were directors, officers or employees of the Target or any of the Subsidiaries,
unless such modification shall be required by Delaware Law.

         (b) From and after the Effective Time, Acquiror and the Surviving
Corporation shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless each person who is now, or
has been at any time prior to the date of this Agreement or who becomes prior to
the Effective Time, an officer, director, employee or agent of the Target or any
of the Subsidiaries (collectively, the "INDEMNIFIED PARTIES") against all
losses, expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees), claims, damages,
liabilities or amounts that are paid in settlement of, with the approval of the
Surviving Corporation (which approval shall not unreasonably be withheld), or
otherwise in connection with, any threatened or actual claim, action, suit,
proceeding or investigation (a "CLAIM"), based in whole or in part on or arising
in whole or in part out of the fact that the Indemnified Party (or the person
controlled by the Indemnified Party) is or was a director, officer, employee or
agent of the Target or any of the Subsidiaries and pertaining to any matter
existing or arising out of actions or omissions occurring at or prior to the
Effective Time (including, without limitation, any Claim arising out of this
Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated hereby), whether asserted or
claimed prior to, at or after the Effective Time, in each case to the fullest
extent permitted under Delaware Law and by Target's Certificate of Incorporation
and Bylaws as in effect on the date hereof, and shall pay any expenses, as
incurred, in advance of the disposition of any such action or proceeding to each
Indemnified Party to the fullest extent permitted under Delaware Law and by
Target's Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws as in effect on the date
hereof. Without limiting the foregoing, in the event any such Claim is brought
against any of the Indemnified Parties, Acquiror or the Surviving Corporation
shall have the right to assume the defense thereof and neither Acquiror nor the
Surviving Corporation shall be liable to such Indemnified Parties for any legal
expenses of other counsel or any other expenses subsequently incurred by such
Indemnified Parties in connection with the defense thereof, except that if
Acquiror or the Surviving Corporation elects not to assume such defense or
counsel for the Indemnified Parties advises that there are substantive issues
that raise conflicts of interest between Acquiror or the Surviving Corporation
and the Indemnified Parties, such Indemnified Parties may retain counsel
satisfactory to them and which shall be reasonably satisfactory to Acquiror and
the Surviving Corporation and they shall pay all reasonable fees and expenses of

such counsel for such Indemnified Parties. The Indemnified Parties, or the
Acquiror and the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, shall use all
reasonable efforts to assist in the defense of any such Claim, provided that the
Acquiror and the Surviving Corporation shall not be liable for any settlement
effected without their written consent, which consent, however, shall not be
unreasonably withheld. The Acquiror and the Surviving Corporation shall be
obligated pursuant to this paragraph to pay only one law firm to represent the
Indemnified Parties with respect to each such Claim unless there is, as
determined by counsel to the Indemnified Parties, under applicable standards of
professional conduct, a conflict or a reasonable likelihood of a conflict on any
significant issue between the positions of any two or more Indemnified Parties
at the expense of the Acquiror and the Surviving Corporation.

         (c) Prior to the Effective Time, the Target shall, and after the
Effective Time Surviving Corporation and the Acquiror shall, to the fullest
extent permitted by Delaware Law, make reasonable advances to the Indemnified
parties to cover expenses for which such Indemnified Parties would otherwise be
entitled to indemnification pursuant to this Section 6.06, provided, however,
that the person to whom the expenses are advanced provides an undertaking to
repay such advances if it is determined that such person is not entitled to
indemnification.

         (d) Acquiror shall maintain in effect for three years from the
Effective Time, the current directors' and officers' liability insurance
policies maintained by the Target (provided that Acquiror may substitute
therefor policies of at least the same coverage containing terms and conditions
which are not materially less favorable) with respect to matters occurring prior
to the Effective Time; provided, however, that in the event that the annual
premium for such coverage is more than 2.0 times the annual premium for such
coverage as of the date hereof, the Acquiror shall only be obligated to maintain
the best coverage that reasonably can be obtained for an annual premium equal to
the 2.0 times the annual premium in effect as of the date hereof; PROVIDED,
FURTHER, that in no event shall the policy limits of such coverage be less than
2/3 of the policy limits currently in effect.

         (e) In the event the Surviving Corporation or the Acquiror
consolidates, liquidates, dissolves or merges into another entity (which events
are in no way prohibited by this Agreement), proper provisions shall be made so
that the successor and assigns of the Surviving Corporation and the Acquiror
satisfy their respective obligations under this Section 6.06.

         SECTION 6.07. OBLIGATIONS OF ACQUIROR SUB. To the extent applicable,
Acquiror shall take all action necessary to cause Target, in accordance with
Section 6.03, to designate Acquiror Sub's designees to serve on the Target Board
as well as cause Acquiror Sub to perform its obligations under this Agreement
and to consummate the Merger on the terms and subject to the conditions set
forth in this Agreement including, but not limited to, the voting of all its
Shares and shares of Class A Preferred Stock in favor of the Merger.

         SECTION 6.08. PUBLIC ANNOUNCEMENTS. (a) Acquiror, Acquiror Sub and the
Target shall consult with each other before issuing any press release or
otherwise making any public statements with respect to this Agreement or any
Transaction and shall not issue any such press release or make any such public

statement prior to such consultation and (b) prior to the Effective Time, the
Target will not issue any other press release or otherwise make any public
statements regarding its business, except as may be required by law or any
listing agreement with the to which the Target is a party.

         SECTION 6.09. DELIVERY OF SEC DOCUMENTS. The Target shall promptly
deliver to Acquiror true and correct copies of any report, statement or schedule
filed with the SEC subsequent to the date of this Agreement.

         SECTION 6.10. NOTIFICATION OF CERTAIN MATTERS. The Target shall give
prompt notice to Acquiror, and Acquiror shall give prompt notice to the Target,
of (a) the occurrence or non-occurrence of any event the occurrence or
non-occurrence of which would be likely to cause any representation or warranty
contained in this Agreement to be untrue or inaccurate in any material respect
and (b) any failure of the Target, Acquiror or Acquiror Sub, as the case may be,
to comply with or satisfy any covenant, condition or agreement to be complied
with or satisfied by it hereunder; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that the delivery of any
notice pursuant to this Section 6.10 shall not limit or otherwise affect the
remedies or conditions of Closing available hereunder to the party receiving
such notice.

         SECTION 6.11. FURTHER ACTION. At any time and from time to time, each
party to this Agreement agrees, subject to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement, to take such actions and to execute and deliver such documents as may
be necessary to effectuate the purposes of this Agreement at the earliest
practicable time.

         SECTION 6.12 EMPLOYEE BENEFITS.

         (a) The Target shall terminate the Exigent International, Inc. Employee
401(K) Profit Sharing and Employee Stock Ownership Plan and the Exigent
International, Inc. Money Purchase Pension Plan and Trust prior to the Effective
Time (except as otherwise required with respect to the Exigent International,
Inc. Money Purchase Pension Plan and Trust to comply with the provisions of
Section 204(h) of ERISA) and shall deliver to the Acquiror a written board
resolution effecting such termination on or before the Effective Time (except as
otherwise required with respect to the Exigent International, Inc. Money
Purchase Pension Plan and Trust to comply with the provisions of Section 204(h)
of ERISA). Target shall not allocate forfeitures under the Exigent
International, Inc. Employee 401(K) Profit Sharing and Employee Stock Ownership
Plan or the Exigent International, Inc. Money Purchase Pension Plan and Trust or
make any distributions in respect of the termination of such plans until receipt
of a favorable determination letter from the Internal Revenue Service. The
Target shall suspend purchases and contributions under the Exigent
International, Inc. Employee Stock Purchase Plan, effective as of April 1, 2001
through the Effective Time.

         (b) Following the Acquiror Sub's Election Date, Acquiror will cause the
Target (and, after the Merger, the Surviving Corporation) and the Subsidiaries
to honor all accrued benefit obligations to current and former employees and
directors under the Target's or Subsidiaries' employee benefit plans and fringe
benefit plans in existence on the date hereof and disclosed in Section 3.10 of
the Target Disclosure Schedule and all employment or severance agreements
entered into by the Target or any of the Subsidiaries or adopted by the Board of
Directors of the Target prior to the date hereof and disclosed in Sections 3.10

or 6.12(b) of the Target Disclosure Schedule; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that nothing
shall prevent Acquiror or the Target (and, after the Merger, the Surviving
Corporation) from taking any action with respect to such plans, obligations or
agreements or refraining from taking any such action which is permitted or
provided for under the terms thereof or under applicable law.

         (c) Employees of the Target and its Subsidiaries shall be eligible to
participate in the Acquiror's employee benefit plans and programs as of the
Effective Time in accordance with the terms and conditions of such plans and
programs as applicable to similarly situated employees of the Acquiror or its
subsidiaries, as the case may be, and applicable law. Employees of the Target
and the Subsidiaries (and, after the Merger, the Surviving Corporation) shall be
given credit for their length of service with the Target and any Subsidiaries
under all employee benefit plans, programs and policies of the Surviving
Corporation or Acquiror in which they are eligible to participate or become
participants for all purposes thereunder, except to the extent that such
crediting would produce duplication of benefits or violate any provision of
ERISA or the Code. Any clause excluding coverage for pre-existing conditions in
any of the welfare plans (as defined in section 3(1) of ERISA, applied without
regard to the exceptions from coverage contained in sections 4(b)(3), 4(b)(4)

Subsidiaries as in effect on the date hereof. Acquiror shall cause employees of
the Target and its Subsidiaries to be credited under the applicable Welfare
Plans of Acquiror and the Surviving Corporation with any amounts paid toward

maximums under Welfare Plans of the Target or its Subsidiaries. Acquiror shall
provide and recognize all accrued but unused vacation and sick days of employees
of the Target and its Subsidiaries as of the Effective Time.

         SECTION 6.13. APPROPRIATE ACTION: CONSENTS; FILINGS. (a) The Target and
Acquiror shall use their reasonable best efforts to (i) take, or cause to be
taken, all appropriate action, and do, or cause to be done, all things
necessary, proper or advisable under applicable law or required to be taken by
any Governmental Authority or otherwise to consummate and make effective the
Transactions as promptly as practicable, (ii) obtain from any Governmental
Authorities any consents, licenses, permits, waivers, approvals, authorizations
or orders required to be obtained or made by Acquiror or the Target or any of
their subsidiaries in connection with the authorization, execution and delivery
of this Agreement and the consummation of the Transactions, including, without
limitation, the Merger, and (iii) as promptly as practicable, make all necessary
filings, and thereafter make any other required submissions, with respect to
this Agreement and the Merger required under (A) the Exchange Act, and any other
applicable federal or state securities laws, (B) Delaware Law, (C) the HSR Act
and any related governmental request thereunder, and (D) any other applicable
law; PROVIDED that Acquiror and the Target shall cooperate with each other in
connection with the making of all such filings, including providing copies of
all such documents to the non-filing party and its advisors prior to filing and,
if requested, to accept all reasonable additions, deletions or changes suggested

in connection therewith. The Target and Acquiror shall use reasonable best
efforts to furnish to each other all information required for any application or
other filing to be made pursuant to the rules and regulations of any applicable
law (including all information required to be included in the Offer Documents
and the Schedule 14D-9) in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.

         (b) (i) Each of Acquiror and the Target shall give (or shall cause
their respective subsidiaries to give) any notices to third parties, and use,
and cause their respective subsidiaries to use, their reasonable best efforts to
obtain any third party consents (including those set forth in Section
3.05(a)(iii)), (A) necessary to consummate the Transactions, (B) disclosed or
required to be disclosed in the Target Disclosure Schedule or the Acquiror
Disclosure Schedule or (C) required to prevent a Material Adverse Effect from
occurring prior to or after Acquiror Sub's Election Date.

         (ii) In the event that Acquiror or the Target shall fail to obtain any
third party consent described in subsection (b)(i) above, it shall use its best
efforts, and shall take any such actions reasonably requested by the other
party, to minimize any adverse effect upon the Target and Acquiror, their
respective subsidiaries, and their respective businesses resulting, or which
could reasonably be expected to result after Acquiror Sub's Election Date, from
the failure to obtain such consent provided nothing in this provision shall
require or imply a waiver of any condition to the Offer or the Merger.

         (c) From the date of this Agreement until Acquiror Sub's Election Date,
each party shall promptly notify the other party of any pending, or to the best
knowledge of the first party, threatened in writing, action, proceeding or
investigation by or before any Governmental Authority or any other person (i)
challenging or seeking material damages in connection with the Transactions or
(ii) seeking to restrain or prohibit the consummation of the Transactions or
otherwise limit the right of Acquiror or, to the knowledge of such first party,
any Acquiror Subsidiary to own or operate all or any portion of the businesses
or assets of the Target.

         SECTION 6.14.  PAYMENTS IN RESPECT OF TARGET OPTIONS.

         (a) All amounts payable pursuant to Section 2.07 shall be subject to
any required withholding of taxes and shall be paid without interest. Target

as shall be necessary to effectuate the provisions of this Agreement relating
thereto. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement,
payment shall, at Acquiror's request, be withheld in respect of any Option until
all necessary consents are obtained.

         (b) The Target Option Plans shall terminate as of the Effective Time,
and the provisions in any other Plan providing for the issuance, transfer or
grant of any capital stock of Target or any interest in respect of any capital
stock of Target shall be deleted as of the Effective Time of the Merger, and
Target shall ensure that following the Effective Time of the Merger no holder of
a Option or any participant in any Target Option Plan or other Plan shall have
any right thereunder to acquire any capital stock of Target or the Surviving
Corporation.

promulgated, enforced or entered any law, order, executive order, stay, decree,

reasonable best efforts to prevent the entry of any such Order and to appeal the

right to terminate this Agreement under this Section 8.01(b) shall not be
available to any party whose failure to fulfill any obligation under this
Agreement has been the cause of, or resulted in, the failure of the Tender Offer
Acceptance Date or the Effective Time to occur on or before such date; provided,

tolled for any part thereof during which any party to this Agreement shall be
subject to a nonfinal order or other action restraining, enjoining or otherwise
prohibiting the purchase of shares of Target Common Stock pursuant to the Offer
or the consummation of the Merger or the calling or holding of the Target
Shareholders Meeting;

         (c) by Acquiror if: (i) due to an occurrence or circumstance that

Acquiror Sub shall have (A) terminated the Offer without having accepted any
Shares for payment thereunder or (B) failed to pay for Shares pursuant to the
Offer within 90 days following the commencement of the Offer, unless any such
termination or failure listed above shall have been caused by or resulted from
the failure of Acquiror or Acquiror Sub to perform in any material respect any
covenant or agreement of either of them contained in this Agreement or the
material breach by Acquiror or Acquiror Sub of any representation or warranty of
either of them contained in this Agreement; or (ii) prior to the purchase of
Shares pursuant to the Offer, (A) the Target's Board of Directors shall have
failed to recommend or withdraws its approval or recommendation of this
Agreement, the Offer or the Merger or shall have resolved to do so, (B) shall
have recommended to the shareholders of the Target, or entered into, or publicly
announced its intention to consummate, an agreement or agreement in principle
with respect to any Superior Proposal or resolved to do so, or (C) a cash tender
offer or exchange offer for fifty percent (50%) or more of the outstanding
shares of capital stock of the Target is commenced (other than by Acquiror or
its affiliates) and the Target's Board of Directors fails to recommend against
the shareholders of the Target tendering their shares into such tender offer or
exchange offer; (D) the Target shall have breached any of its obligations under
Section 6.05 in any material respect, and such breach shall have had a material
adverse impact on the consummation of the Transactions; (E) the board of
directors of the Target shall exempt any other person from the provisions of
Section 203 of Delaware Law or the Florida Control-Share Acquisition Law; or (F)
any person shall have become an "Acquiring Person" under the Rights Plan, or the
Board of Directors shall have taken action excluding a person from becoming an
Acquiring Person who, in the absence of such Board action, would otherwise be an
Aquiring Person under the Rights Plan; or

         (d) by the Target if: (i) Acquiror Sub shall have (A) failed to
commence the Offer within fifteen (15) days following the date of this
Agreement, (B) terminated the Offer without having accepted any Shares for
payment thereunder or (C) failed to pay for Shares pursuant to the terms of the
Offer or as required under the Act, unless any such failure or termination
listed above shall have been caused by or resulted from the failure of the
Target or the Tendering Shareholder to perform in any material respect any
covenant or agreement contained in this Agreement or the Voting and Tender
Agreement, respectively, or the material breach by the Target or the Tendering
Shareholder of any representation or warranty contained in this Agreement or the
Voting and Tender Agreement, respectively; or (ii) the board of directors of the
Target shall approve, and the Target shall enter into, a definitive agreement
providing for the implementation of a Superior Proposal; provided, however, that
(A) the Target is not and has not been in breach of Section 6.05, with respect
to such Superior Proposal in any material respect and (B) the Target's board of

directors authorizes the Target, subject to complying with the terms of this
Agreement, to enter into a binding written agreement concerning a transaction
that constitutes a Superior Proposal and the Target notifies Acquiror in writing
that it intends to enter into such an agreement, attaching the most current
version of such agreement to such notice;

         SECTION 8.02. FEES AND EXPENSES. (a) The Target shall pay or cause to
be paid, in same day funds to the Acquiror, the "Acquiror Expenses" and the
"Termination Fee" in the event this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section
8.01(c)(ii) or 8.01(d)(ii); provided, however, that in the event this Agreement
is terminated pursuant to clauses (B), (C), (E) or (F) of Section 8.01(c)(ii) or
pursuant to Section 8.01(d)(ii), the Termination Fee shall not be payable unless
the Superior Proposal, tender offer or other transaction giving rise to the
termination is consummated. The "Acquiror Expenses" means the documented
out-of-pocket fees and expenses reasonably incurred and paid by or on behalf of
Acquiror in connection with this Agreement, the Offer, the Merger, the Voting

hereby and thereby, including, without limitation, all governmental filing fees
and fees and expenses of counsel, commercial banks, printers, paying agents,

The Termination Fee means an amount equal to $690,000, less any previously paid
Acquiror Expenses. Any Termination Fee payable pursuant to this Section 8.02(a)
shall be payable as promptly as practicable following the consummation of the
Superior Proposal or other transaction or event giving rise to the obligation to
pay such Termination Fee.

         (b) In addition, in the event that after the date hereof a
Business Combination Proposal shall have been made to the Target or any of its
Subsidiaries or stockholders or any person shall have announced an intention
(whether or not conditional) to make a Business Combination Proposal and
thereafter this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 8.01(c)(i) or
8.01(d)(i) as a result of the Minimum Condition not being satisfied and within
12 months of such termination such person acquires, directly or indirectly, more
than fifty percent (50%) of the Shares then outstanding or all or a material
portion of the assets of Target and its Subsidiaries, then the Target shall pay
Acquiror an amount equal to the Termination Fee, less any amounts, if any, paid
pursuant to Section 8.02(b). Any amounts payable pursuant to this Section
8.02(a) shall be payable upon the consummation of the transaction or the
occurrence of the event giving rise to such obligation.

         (c) Except as set forth in this Section, all costs and expenses
incurred in connection with this Agreement and the Transactions shall be paid by
the party incurring such expenses, whether or not any Transaction is
consummated.

         SECTION 8.03. AMENDMENT. This Agreement may be amended by the parties
hereto by action taken by or on behalf of their respective boards of directors
at any time prior to the Effective Time; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that, after the
approval of this Agreement and the Transactions by the shareholders of the
Target, no amendment may be made which would violate Delaware Law. This
Agreement may not be amended except by an instrument in writing signed by the
parties hereto.

         SECTION 8.04. WAIVER. At any time prior to the Effective Time, any
party hereto may (a) extend the time for the performance of any obligation or
other act of any other party hereto, (b) waive any inaccuracy in the
representations and warranties of any other party contained herein or in any
document delivered pursuant hereto and (c) waive compliance with any agreement
of any other party or condition benefiting such party contained herein. Any such

each of the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement.

                  (b) At any meeting of stockholders of the Target or at any
adjournment thereof or in any other circumstances upon which the Stockholder's

dissolution, liquidation or winding up of or by the Target or any other Business
Combination Proposal or (ii) any amendment of the Target's Certificate of
Incorporation or By-laws or other proposal or transaction involving the Target

or any of its affiliates, which amendment or other proposal or transaction would
in any manner impede, frustrate, prevent or nullify the Merger, the Merger
Agreement or any of the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement.

                  (c) The Stockholder agrees not to (i) sell, transfer, pledge,
assign or otherwise dispose of, or enter into any contract, option or other

Option and (ii) the excess, if any, of the Per Share Amount over the exercise

         4. ASSIGNMENT. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights, interests
or obligations hereunder shall be assigned by any of the parties without the
prior written consent of the other parties, except that Acquiror Sub may assign

remedies, the other party shall be entitled to an injunction restraining any
violation or threatened violation of the provisions of this Agreement. In the
event that any action should be brought in equity to enforce the provisions of
the Agreement, none of the parties will allege, and each of the parties hereby
waives the defense, that there is an adequate remedy at law.

                  (c) JURISDICTION; VENUE. Each party hereby irrevocably submits
to the exclusive jurisdiction of the United States District Court for the
Northern District of Florida in any action, suit or proceeding arising in
connection with this Agreement, and agrees that any such action, suit or
proceeding shall be brought only in such courts (and waives any objection based
on forum non convenience or any other objection to venue therein).

legal substance of the transactions contemplated hereby are not affected in any
manner materially adverse to any party. Upon such determination that any term or
other provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the parties
shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the

Attention:        Gary McArthur
                  Vice President, Corporate Development

Dear Mr. McArthur:

         In connection with the consideration by Harris Corporation ("Harris";
references to "you" or "your" being references to Harris) of a possible
transaction involving Exigent International, Inc., and its affiliates
(collectively the "Company") you have requested information concerning the
Company. As a condition to your being furnished with such information, you agree
to treat any information concerning the Company which is furnished to you by or
on behalf of the Company, or after the date of this letter and regardless of the
manner in which it is furnished, together with analyses, compilations, studies
or other documents or records prepared by you or any of your directors,
officers, employees, affiliates, agents or advisors (including, without
limitation, attorneys, accountants, consultants, bankers, financial advisors and
any representatives of your advisors) (collectively, "Representatives") to the
extent that such analyses, compilations, studies, documents or records contain
or otherwise reflect or are generated from such information (hereinafter
collectively referred to as the "Evaluation Material"), in accordance with the
provisions of this agreement. The term "Evaluation Material" does not include
information which (i) is not clearly labeled as "Evaluation Material",
"confidential", "proprietary" or its equivalent at the time of delivery and
which if disclosed orally is identified as "Evaluation Material" or
"confidential", or "proprietary" or its equivalent at the time of disclosure and
confirmed as such in writing within 20 days of disclosure, (ii) was or becomes
generally available to the public other than as a result of a disclosure by you
or your Representatives, (iii) was or becomes available to you on a
non-confidential basis from a source other than the Company or its advisors
provided that such source is not known to you to be bound by a confidentiality
agreement with the Company or otherwise prohibited from transmitting the
information to you by a contractual, legal or fiduciary obligation or (iv) was
within your possession prior to its being furnished to you by or on behalf of
the Company, as evidenced by your prior internal documentation, provided that
the source of such information was not known by you to be bound by a
confidentiality agreement with the Company or otherwise prohibited from
transmitting the information to you by a contractual, legal or fiduciary
obligation or (v) is independently developed by Harris or its Representatives
without the benefit of the Evaluation Materials supplied hereunder. Any
combination of information shall not be deemed to be within the foregoing
exceptions because individual features of the information are in the public
domain.

         You hereby agree that the Evaluation Material will be used solely for
the purpose of evaluating a possible transaction between the Company and you,
and not used for any commercial purpose, and that such Evaluation Material will
be kept confidential by you and your Representatives; provided, however, that
(a) such Evaluation Material may be disclosed to your Representatives who need
to know such information for the purpose of evaluating any such possible
transaction between the Company and you (it being understood that such
Representatives shall have been informed by you of the confidential and
proprietary nature of the Evaluation Material and advised of this agreement),
(b) any disclosure of such Evaluation Material may be made to which the Company
consents in writing prior to disclosure, (c) any

disclosure of Evaluation Materials may be made with the prior written consent of
the Company; and (d) as otherwise permitted hereby. In any event, you shall be
responsible for any breach of this agreement by any of your Representatives. You
further agree that the Evaluation Material that is in written form shall not be
copied or reproduced at any time without the prior written consent of the
Company, except for distribution to your Representatives in accordance with and
subject to the provisions of this agreement.

         The terms of confidentiality under this agreement shall not be
construed to limit Harris' right to independently develop or acquire products
without use of the Evaluation Material. The Company acknowledges that Harris may
currently or in the future be developing information internally, or receiving
information from other parties, that is similar to the Evaluation Materials.
Accordingly, nothing in this agreement will be construed as a representation or
agreement that Harris will not develop or have developed for its products,
concepts, systems or techniques that are similar to or compete with the
products, concepts, systems or techniques contemplated by or embodied in the
Evaluation Materials provided that Harris does not violate any of its
obligations under this Agreement in connection with such development.

         In addition, without the prior written consent of the other party
hereto, a party will not, and will direct its Representatives not to, disclose
to any person (i) the existence of this agreement and that the Evaluation
Material has been made available to you or your Representatives, (ii) that
discussions or negotiations are taking place concerning a possible transaction
between the Company and you or (iii) any terms, conditions or other facts with
respect to any such possible transaction, including the status thereof.

         In the event that you are requested or required (by oral questions,
interrogatories, requests for information or documents, subpoena, civil
investigative demand or other process) to disclose any Evaluation Material, it
is agreed that you will (unless prohibited by law or legal practice) provide the
Company with prompt notice of any such request or requirement (written if
practical) so that the Company may seek an appropriate protective order or waive
your compliance with the provisions of this agreement. If, failing the entry of
a protective order or the receipt of a waiver hereunder, you are, after
consultation with legal counsel to that effect, legally compelled to disclose
Evaluation Material, you may disclose only that portion of the Evaluation
Material which you are legally compelled to disclose and at the expense of the
Company will use commercially reasonable measures to obtain assurance that
confidential treatment will be accorded to that portion of the Evaluation
Material which is being disclosed. In any event, unless such would subject you
to censure or penalty, you will not oppose action by the Company to obtain an
appropriate protective order or other reliable assurance that confidential
treatment will be accorded the Evaluation Material. Nothing in this paragraph
shall require you to undertake litigation on your behalf or on the behalf of the
Company or to subject you to penalty or legal censure.

         You agree not to, and will cause your Representatives not to, initiate
or maintain contact (except for those contacts made in the ordinary course of
business) in connection with a potential acquisition transaction between you and
the Company with any officer, director or employee of the Company or any other
third party with whom the Company has a business relationship (including
customers or suppliers) regarding the Company's business, operations, prospects
or finances, except with the express written permission of the Company. Until
the earlier of (i) the consummation of an acquisition by Harris and the Company,
(ii) the consummation of an acquisition between the Company and a third party,
or (iii) ninety days from the date of this agreement, no person to whom
Evaluation Material has been furnished or who is otherwise involved in the
evaluation of a potential acquisition shall, without the Company's consent,
directly or indirectly solicit for employment with the Government Communications
Systems Division, any person introduced to you in the evaluation of a
transaction. Notwithstanding the above, (i) nothing in

this paragraph shall prevent Harris from placing a general solicitation
advertisement or employing search firms or consultants provided they are not
directed specifically at such key employees, and (ii) Harris shall not be deemed
to have solicited any such key employee who initiates or solicits employment
from Harris or who has ceased to be an employee of the Company prior to the
commencement of employment discussions between Harris and such employee. It is
understood that unless otherwise directed by the Company, CIBC World Markets
Corp., in its capacity as financial advisor to the Company, will arrange for
appropriate contacts for due diligence purposes. All (i) communications
regarding this transaction, (ii) requests for additional information, (iii)
requests for facility tours or management meetings, and (iv) discussions or
questions regarding procedures, will be submitted or directed to CIBC World
Markets Corp.

         In consideration of your being furnished the Evaluation Materials and
in view of the fact that the Evaluation Materials consist and will consist of
confidential, non-public and proprietary information, you agree that for a
period of one (1) year from the date of this agreement, that, without the prior
written consent of the Company, neither you nor any of your controlled
affiliates as defined in Rule 12b under the Securities Act of 1934, as amended
will, directly or indirectly, alone or in concert with others unless
specifically requested to do so in advance or consented to in writing by the
Company; (i) purchase, offer or agree to purchase, or announce an intention to
purchase any securities or assets, except in the ordinary course of business, of
the Company or any subsidiary or rights or options to acquire the same; (ii)
make, or in any way participate in any "solicitation" of "proxies" to vote or
"consents" (as such terms are used in the rules and regulations of the
Securities and Exchange Commission), or seek to advise or influence any person
with respect to the voting of any voting securities of the Company; (iii)
initiate or support any stockholder proposal with respect to the Company; (iv)
make any public statements and/or announcement with respect to, or submit a
proposal for, or offer of (with or without conditions) any extraordinary
transaction involving the Company or its securities, assets or business or any
subsidiary or division thereof, or of any successor thereto or any controlling
person thereof; (v) seek or propose to influence or control the Company's
management, board of directors, policies or affairs, except in the ordinary
course of a commercial business transaction; (vi) disclose any intention, plan
or arrangement inconsistent with the foregoing; (vii) form, join or in any way
participate in a "group" as defined in Section 13(d)(3) of the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934 (the "Exchange Act") in connection with any of the
foregoing, (viii) take any action that, in the sole judgement of the Company,
may require the Company to make a public announcement concerning any of the
foregoing, except in the ordinary course of business, or (ix) encourage any of
the foregoing. Nothing herein shall prevent Harris from purchasing shares of the
Company in an amount not to exceed 5%.

         You understand and acknowledge that any and all information contained
in the Evaluation Material is being provided without any representation or
warranty, express or implied, as to the accuracy or completeness of the
Evaluation Material, on the part of the Company or CIBC World Markets Corp. You
agree that, except as set forth in a definitive agreement, none of the Company,
CIBC World Markets Corp. or any of their respective affiliates or
representatives shall have any liability to you or any of your Representatives
by virtue of this agreement. It is understood that the scope of any
representations and warranties to be given by the Company will be negotiated
along with other terms and conditions in arriving at a mutually acceptable form
of definitive agreement should discussions between you and the Company progress
to such a point.

         All Evaluation Material disclosed by the Company shall be and shall
remain the property of the Company. In the event that the parties do not proceed
with the transaction that is the subject of this letter promptly after being so
requested by the Company, you shall return or destroy all documents thereof
furnished to you by the Company in writing. Except to the extent a party is
advised by counsel such

destruction is prohibited by law, you will also return to Company or destroy all
written material, memoranda, notes, copies, excerpts and other writings or
recordings whatsoever prepared by you or your Representatives based upon,
containing or otherwise reflecting any Evaluation Material. Any destruction of
materials shall be verified by you in writing by one of your duly authorized
officers.

         The parties agree that unless and until a definitive agreement
regarding a transaction between the Company and you has been executed, neither
the Company nor you will be under any legal obligation of any kind whatsoever
with respect to such a transaction by virtue of this agreement except for the
matters specifically agreed to herein. The parties further acknowledge and agree
that either party reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to reject any and
all proposals made by the other party or any of its Representatives with regard
to a transaction between the Company and you, to terminate discussions and
negotiations with the other party or its Representatives at any time and to
conduct any process for a transaction involving the Company as it may determine.

         It is understood and agreed that money damages may not be a sufficient
remedy for any breach of this agreement and that the Company may be entitled to
specific performance and to seek injunctive or other equitable relief as a
remedy for any such breach and you further agree to waive any requirement for
the security or posting of any bond in connection with such remedy. Such remedy
shall not be deemed to be the exclusive remedy for breach of this agreement but
shall be in addition to all other remedies available at law or equity to the
Company. In the event of litigation relating to this agreement, if a court of
competent jurisdiction determines in a final, non-appealable order that (i) you
or your Representatives have breached this agreement, then you shall reimburse
the Company for its reasonable legal fees and expenses incurred in connection
with such litigation, including any appeals therefrom, or (ii) the Company has
breached this agreement, then the Company shall reimburse you for your
reasonable legal fees and expenses incurred in connection with such litigation,
including any appeals therefrom. If a party is successful in litigation and
determined not to be in breach of the terms hereof it shall be entitled to
recoup reasonable legal fees and expenses incurred in connection with such
litigation.

         This agreement shall be governed and construed in accordance with the
laws of the State of Florida, regardless of the laws that might otherwise govern
under applicable principles of conflicts of law thereof. You agree, on behalf of
yourself and your Representatives, to submit to the jurisdiction of any court of
competent jurisdiction located in the state of Florida to resolve any dispute
relating to this agreement and waive any right to move to dismiss or transfer
any such action brought in any such court on the basis of any objection to
personal jurisdiction or venue.

         Your obligations under this agreement shall automatically expire two
(2) years from the date hereof, except as otherwise explicitly stated above.

         This agreement may be executed in two or more counterparts, each of
which shall be deemed to be an original, but all of which shall constitute one
and the same agreement. This letter agreement may not be amended or modified
except by a written instrument executed by Harris and the Company. Please
confirm that the foregoing is in accordance with your understanding of our
agreement by signing and returning to us a copy of this letter.

Very truly yours,

CIBC WORLD MARKETS CORP.

Exigent International, Inc.
