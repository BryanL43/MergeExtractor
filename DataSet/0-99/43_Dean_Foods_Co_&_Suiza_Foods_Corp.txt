(1) This registration statement covers the number of shares of Suiza Foods
    Corporation common stock, par value $0.01 per share, issuable upon
    consummation of the merger of Dean Foods Company with a wholly-owned
    subsidiary of Suiza. The number of shares of Suiza common stock to be issued

    number of shares of Dean common stock issued and outstanding immediately
    prior to the merger. The proposed maximum amount to be registered is based
    on an exchange ratio of 0.429 shares of Suiza common stock to be issued in
    the merger for each issued and outstanding share of Dean common stock, and
    the number of shares of Dean common stock issued and outstanding as of
    July 10, 2001, which was 35,737,000 shares.

(2) Estimated solely for the purpose of determining the registration fee in
    accordance with Rule 457(c) under the Securities Act. The maximum price per
    share information is based on the average of the high and the low sale
    prices of Suiza's common stock, $0.01 par value per share, reported on the
    New York Stock Exchange on July 10, 2001.

                 MERGER PROPOSED--YOUR VOTE IS VERY IMPORTANT!

                                            , 2001

Dear Stockholder:

    We are pleased to report that on April 4, 2001, the boards of directors of
Suiza Foods Corporation and Dean Foods Company approved a merger agreement that
provides for the combination of our companies.

    Upon completion of the merger, each stockholder of Dean will receive, in
exchange for each Dean share held, 0.429 shares of Suiza's common stock plus
$21.00 in cash, subject to adjustment in certain circumstances as described in
this joint proxy statement/prospectus. Suiza will issue approximately
15.3 million shares of common stock to Dean's stockholders in the merger
(excluding shares to be issued upon the exercise of currently outstanding Dean
stock options). These shares will represent approximately 35% of the outstanding
shares of Suiza's common stock after the merger. Because Dean's name carries a
significant amount of consumer recognition and loyalty as a result of Dean's
76-year history of delivering quality products to its customers, Suiza will
change its name to Dean Foods Company at the time of the merger, and Suiza's
trading symbol on the New York Stock Exchange will change from "SZA" to "DF."

    Our merger agreement contains several conditions which must be satisfied
before we can complete the merger. One such condition requires that Dean's
stockholders approve the merger. Another condition requires that Suiza's
stockholders approve the issuance of Suiza's common stock in connection with the
merger.

    In order to ensure that Suiza has a sufficient number of options and stock
awards available after the merger to reward and incent its expanded ranks of key
employees and directors, Suiza is also proposing that its stockholders approve,
if the merger occurs, (1) Suiza's adoption of Dean's 1989 Stock Awards Plan, and
(2) an increase in the number of shares of its common stock reserved for
issuance under Suiza's 1997 Stock Option and Restricted Stock Plan.

    This joint proxy statement/prospectus contains a great deal of important
information that you should consider in determining your vote. IN PARTICULAR,
PLEASE SEE "RISK FACTORS" BEGINNING ON PAGE 21 FOR A DISCUSSION OF CERTAIN RISKS
THAT YOU SHOULD CONSIDER.

    Both of our companies will hold special stockholder meetings for the purpose
of voting on the proposals described in this joint proxy statement/prospectus.
We are furnishing you this document in connection with the solicitation of your
vote by the boards of directors of our companies at these meetings. The dates,
times and places of the meetings are:

For Suiza's stockholders:              For Dean's stockholders:
[Month and Day], 2001                  [Month and Day], 2001
[Time]                                 [Time]
[Place]                                [Place]

    We are very excited about this transaction, and believe that our companies
will be able to create more value together than either company could achieve
alone. We believe that the merger is in the best interest of our stockholders,
and recommend that you vote "FOR" the proposals described in this joint proxy
statement/ prospectus.

    Please read this document carefully.

    Sincerely,

                             QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS

I AM A DEAN STOCKHOLDER. IF THE MERGER IS COMPLETED, WHAT WILL I RECEIVE IN
EXCHANGE FOR MY SHARES OF DEAN?

    You will receive a combination of cash and Suiza stock. Specifically, you
will receive, in exchange for each of your Dean shares, $21.00 in cash plus
0.429 shares of Suiza's common stock, subject to adjustment if the price of
Suiza's common stock is below $32.71 when the merger occurs. In that case, the
mix of cash and stock that you receive would change. You would receive less cash
and more stock, without changing the total value you receive in exchange for
your Dean shares. For more information, see "The Merger and the Merger
Agreement--What Dean's Stockholders Will Receive" on page 39. The reason for
this adjustment is to ensure that the merger will qualify as a "tax-free
reorganization" under federal tax laws. For more information about the tax
consequences of the merger, see "The Merger and the Merger Agreement--Material
Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger" on page 53. The final mix of cash
and stock will be determined on the day of the merger, and we will issue a press
release on that day announcing the final per share amounts of cash and stock to
be issued in the merger.

I AM A DEAN STOCKHOLDER. WHAT DO I NEED TO DO TO GET MY CASH AND SHARES OF
  SUIZA'S COMMON STOCK?

    Promptly following the merger, Suiza will mail you instructions for
exchanging your shares. You do not need to do anything now, other than read this
document and vote.

WHEN DO YOU EXPECT THE MERGER TO BE COMPLETED?

    In addition to stockholder approvals, we must also obtain certain regulatory
approvals. We are working to obtain these approvals as soon as possible. At this
time, we expect to complete the merger during the third or fourth calendar
quarter of 2001. As soon as we have obtained the necessary regulatory approvals,
we will issue a press release announcing the exact time that the merger will be
completed.

HOW CAN I BE SURE I RECEIVE NOTICE OF ANY PRESS RELEASES ABOUT THE MERGER?

    To receive copies of any Suiza press releases concerning the merger:

    - go to Suiza's website at www.suizafoods.com and click on "Press Releases."
      Sign up to receive e-mail notification of any Suiza press releases by
      entering your internet e-mail address in the box on the middle of the
      page; or

    - call Suiza's Investor Relations department toll-free at 1-800-431-9214 and
      ask to be added to Suiza's mailing list for press releases concerning the
      merger.

    To receive copies of any Dean press releases concerning the merger:

    - go to Dean's website at www.deanfoods.com and click on "Financial" and
      then click on "Financial News." Click on "E-mail Alerts Signup" at the top
      of your screen, and follow the instructions on the screen to receive
      e-mail notification of any Dean press releases; or

    - call Dean's Director of Corporate Communications toll-free at
      1-800-971-3326 and ask to be added to Dean's mailing list for press
      releases concerning the merger.

WHAT DO I NEED TO DO NOW?

    First, you should carefully read this document. The next step is to vote.
Please see the enclosed proxy card for instructions on how to vote.

WHAT IF I VOTE NOW, BUT THEN DECIDE I WANT TO CHANGE MY VOTE?

    You can change your vote at any time before your stockholder meeting for any
reason. If you are a Suiza stockholder, you can change your vote before Suiza's
stockholder meeting by:

    - writing to Suiza or submitting a later-dated proxy to Suiza at 2515
      McKinney Avenue, Suite 1200, Dallas, Texas 75201, Attention: Corporate
      Secretary;

    - voting again by telephone or internet by following the instructions listed
      on the enclosed proxy card (the last vote entered before the meeting
      begins will be counted); or

    - if you are a registered Suiza stockholder, coming to Suiza's stockholder
      meeting and changing your vote in writing.

    If you are a Dean stockholder, you can change your vote before Dean's
stockholder meeting by:

    - writing to Dean or submitting a later-dated proxy to Dean at 3600 North
      River Road, Franklin Park, Illinois 60131, Attention: Corporate Secretary;
      or

    - if you are a registered Dean stockholder, coming to Dean's stockholder
      meeting and changing your vote in writing.

WHAT HAPPENS IF I DON'T VOTE? HOW MANY VOTES ARE NECESSARY TO APPROVE THE
  PROPOSALS?

    If you are a Dean stockholder and you don't vote or you "abstain", your
ballot will have the same effect as if you voted against the merger, because
approval of the merger requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the
outstanding shares of Dean's common stock.

    If you are a Suiza stockholder and you don't vote, your failure to vote may
affect whether there will be enough stockholders present (in person or by proxy)
at the Suiza stockholder meeting to hold the meeting. A majority of Suiza's
outstanding shares must be present (in person or by proxy) at the meeting in
order to conduct the meeting. A Suiza stockholder's failure to vote may also
affect whether the shares issued in the merger and under Dean's stock awards
plan and the additional shares proposed for authorization under Suiza's option
plan will qualify for listing on the New York Stock Exchange. The holders of at
least 50% of Suiza's outstanding stock must vote (by voting any of "yes," "no"
or "abstain") in order for shares issued in the merger, and under Dean's stock
awards plan and the additional shares proposed for authorization under Suiza's
option plan, to be listed on the New York Stock Exchange. If you are a Suiza
stockholder and you "abstain" on any of the three proposals, your ballot will
have the practical effect of a vote against that proposal, because abstaining
shares are counted as shares present at the meeting, and approval of each
proposal requires the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the
shares with voting power present at the meeting. For purposes of the New York
Stock Exchange requirement, "abstaining" is a form of voting.

IF MY SHARES ARE HELD IN A BROKERAGE ACCOUNT, WILL MY BROKER VOTE MY SHARES FOR
  ME?

    Generally, if your shares are held in a brokerage account, they are not
officially registered in your name but, rather, in your broker's name. In this
case, your shares are said to be held in "street name." If your shares are not
held in "street name" by your broker, then you are a "registered stockholder."

    If your shares are held in "street name," you can only vote through your
broker because your shares are officially held in the name of your broker. If
you want to vote in person at the meeting, you must have a proper power of
attorney from your broker. If you want to vote by mail, telephone or internet,
you must do so by following the instructions on the enclosed voting card. Even
though your shares are held in your broker's name, your broker cannot vote for
you without your instruction (although your broker can cause your shares to be
present for quorum purposes even if you do not give an instruction on how to
vote). You should therefore instruct your broker how to vote for you by
following the directions on the enclosed voting card provided by your broker.

    If you are a registered stockholder, your broker cannot vote for you at all,
or cause your shares to be present at the meeting for quorum purposes. If you
are a registered stockholder, you can only vote

by one of the means indicated on the enclosed proxy card or by voting in person
at the meeting. Likewise, you will only be deemed to be present at the meeting
if you come to the meeting in person, or if you vote prior to the meeting (by
voting any of "yes," "no" or "abstain") according to the instructions on the
enclosed proxy card.

    If you received more than one copy of this joint proxy statement/prospectus,
then your shares are probably held in more than one account, and you should vote
on each proxy card that you receive in order to ensure that all of your shares
are voted.

I AM A SUIZA STOCKHOLDER. WILL I RECEIVE ANY CASH OR STOCK AS A RESULT OF THE
  MERGER?

    No. Suiza's stockholders will not receive any cash or stock in connection
with the merger. You will simply continue to hold the stock you currently own.
If you wish to exchange your existing stock certificates after the merger for
certificates that bear Suiza's new name, you may send your certificates, after
the merger, to Suiza's transfer agent for exchange. Your new certificates will
represent exactly the same number of shares as your old certificates.

I AM A DEAN STOCKHOLDER. WILL I HAVE TO PAY TAXES ON THE CASH AND STOCK I
RECEIVE IN THE MERGER?

    You will recognize taxable gain equal to the lesser of (1) the amount of
cash you receive in the merger and (2) an amount equal to (a) the fair market
value of the Suiza common stock and cash that you receive in the merger minus
(b) your tax basis (which is generally equal to your cost) for the shares of
Dean common stock that you are exchanging in the merger. For a further
discussion of the possible tax consequences of the merger, see "The Merger and
the Merger Agreement--Material Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger" on
page 53.

WILL DEAN'S STOCKHOLDERS CONTINUE TO RECEIVE DIVIDENDS AFTER THE MERGER?

    No. Suiza has never paid dividends and does not anticipate paying dividends
in the foreseeable future, even after the merger is completed. However, subject
to approval by Dean's board of directors, Dean will continue paying its regular
quarterly dividend until the merger is completed.

I AM A SUIZA STOCKHOLDER. CAN I VOTE IN FAVOR OF THE MERGER PROPOSAL AND AGAINST
ONE OR BOTH OF THE OPTION PLAN PROPOSALS?

    Yes. When you vote, you will be asked to vote "for," "against" or "abstain"
on the merger proposal and the two option plan proposals as separate votes, and
you can vote for, against or abstain in any combination on Suiza's three
proposals. See the enclosed proxy card.

HOW CAN I FIND OUT WHETHER THE PROPOSALS WERE APPROVED BY THE STOCKHOLDERS?

    Immediately after the stockholder meetings, Suiza and Dean will issue press
releases announcing the voting results of the meetings.

CAN I DEMAND AN APPRAISAL OF MY SHARES?

    Each Dean stockholder has the right to a judicial appraisal of the fair
value of his or her shares under Delaware law. The procedure for perfecting
appraisal rights is described under "The Merger and the Merger
Agreement--Appraisal Rights" on page 55. Suiza's stockholders do not have
appraisal rights.

WHO DO I CALL IF I HAVE FURTHER QUESTIONS?

    Suiza stockholders may call Suiza's Investor Relations department toll-free
at 1-800-431-9214.

    Dean stockholders may call Dean's Director of Corporate Communications
toll-free at 1-800-971-3326.

                                 THE COMPANIES

SUIZA FOODS CORPORATION
AND BLACKHAWK ACQUISITION CORP.

    Suiza Foods Corporation, based in Dallas, Texas, is the leading manufacturer
and distributor of dairy products in the United States. Suiza currently divides
its business into three broad groups, including Suiza Dairy Group, Morningstar
Foods and International/Other.

    Suiza Dairy Group sells primarily fresh dairy products, with its product mix
weighted heavily toward fluid milk, including flavored milks and buttermilk.
Other products that Suiza Dairy Group sells include ice cream and ice cream
novelties, half-and-half and whipping cream, condensed milk, cottage cheese,
sour cream, yogurt, dips, coffee creamers, juice and juice drinks and water.
Suiza Dairy Group manufactures its products in 67 plants in 29 states, and
markets its products primarily on a local or regional basis. Due to the highly
perishable nature of many of its products, it delivers its products directly
from its plants or distribution warehouses to its customers in trucks owned or
leased by Suiza Dairy Group. Suiza Dairy Group has one of the most extensive
refrigerated "direct store delivery" systems in the United States, with over
4,300 delivery routes across the country. In 2000, Suiza Dairy Group
manufactured and marketed approximately two thirds of its dairy products under
its proprietary and licensed brand names. The remaining one third of Suiza Dairy
Group's products were manufactured and sold on a private-label (or "customer
brand") basis for customers. Proprietary brands used in Suiza Dairy Group
include the following regional brands: ADOHR FARMS-Registered Trademark-,
BARBE'S-Registered Trademark-, BROUGHTON-Registered Trademark-, BROWN'S
DAIRY-Registered Trademark-, COUNTRY DELITE-TM-, COUNTRY

licensed brands including BORDEN-Registered Trademark-,
FOREMOST-Registered Trademark- and PET-Registered Trademark-, and under its
proprietary KIDSMILK-Registered Trademark- and FITMILK-Registered Trademark-
brands. In 2000, Suiza Dairy Group's sales comprised approximately 81% of
Suiza's total sales.

    Morningstar Foods sells primarily extended shelf life (ESL) fluid, aerosol
and other dairy and non-dairy products. Its product offerings include dairy and
non-dairy coffee creamers, flavored and unflavored ESL milks, lactose-free milk
and soymilk, aerosol whipped topping, dairy and non-dairy frozen whipped
topping, egg substitute and cultured dairy products. Morningstar Foods markets
its products primarily on a national basis and in several foreign countries.
Unlike Suiza Dairy Group, Morningstar Foods' specialty and ESL products are
delivered to customers primarily by common carrier. Morningstar Foods
manufactures its products in ten plants across the United States. In 2000,
Morningstar Foods manufactured and marketed approximately 40% of its products
under its proprietary and licensed brand names. The remaining approximately 60%
of Morningstar Foods' products were manufactured and sold on a private label (or
"customer brand") basis for customers. Proprietary brands used by Morningstar
Foods include the following national brands: INTERNATIONAL
DELIGHT-Registered Trademark-, SUN SOY-TM-, SECOND NATURE-Registered Trademark-,
NATURALLY YOURS-Registered Trademark- and MOCHA MIX-Registered Trademark-.
Morningstar Foods has also entered into agreements to sell products under
certain partner or licensed brands including HERSHEY'S-Registered Trademark- and
FOLGER'S JAKADA-Registered Trademark-. In 2000, Morningstar Foods' sales
comprised approximately 12% of Suiza's total sales.

    Suiza's international operations consist of its 75% interest in Leche Celta,
one of the largest dairy processors in Spain. Leche Celta operates three plants
in Spain, and sells primarily branded ultra-high temperature (UHT) fluid milk.
Suiza also has operations on the island of Puerto Rico conducted under the name
"Suiza Dairy." Suiza Dairy operates four plants across the island, and
manufactures primarily fresh dairy products with its product mix weighted
heavily toward branded fluid milk and juice drinks. Additionally, Suiza owns
43.1% of Consolidated Container Company, one of the nation's largest
manufacturers of rigid plastic containers.

    Blackhawk Acquisition Corp. is a newly formed Delaware corporation and a
wholly-owned subsidiary of Suiza. Blackhawk was organized solely for the purpose
of effecting the merger with Dean Foods Company. Blackhawk has no material
assets and has not engaged in any activities except for the execution and
approval of the merger agreement.

    The principal executive offices of Suiza and Blackhawk are located at 2515
McKinney Avenue, Suite 1200, Dallas, Texas 75201, telephone number
(214) 303-3400.

                  REASONS FOR THE MERGER (SEE PAGES 33 AND 37)

    Our boards of directors believe that the merger will create value for the
stockholders of both companies by enabling them to participate in a combined
company with enhanced prospects for growth and profitability. Set forth below
are a few of the reasons why we are proposing the merger:

    - We have complementary product offerings and geographic reach. Merging our
      businesses will create the first truly national dairy and specialty food
      company with the geographic reach, management depth and product mix
      necessary to grow and compete effectively against larger, more diversified
      food and beverage companies. Together, we will be better positioned to
      meet the needs of our customers, including our large national customers
      who would benefit from the added service, convenience and value that a
      national dairy company could provide.

    - By combining our businesses, we expect to further reduce our costs, which
      will allow us to become more efficient and, therefore, compete more
      effectively.

    - After the merger, we will have greater resources to invest in innovation
      and marketing. We believe that innovation is critical to increased sales
      and consumption of dairy products, which should benefit the entire
      industry. We also believe that increased marketing will help increase
      sales.

OUR RECOMMENDATIONS TO STOCKHOLDERS CONCERNING THE MERGER (SEE PAGES 36 AND 39)

To Dean's stockholders:

    Dean's board of directors believes that the merger is fair and in the best
interests of Dean and its stockholders and unanimously recommends that you vote
"FOR" the proposal to approve the merger agreement and the merger.

To Suiza's stockholders:

    Suiza's board of directors believes that the merger is fair and in the best
interests of Suiza and its stockholders and unanimously recommends that you vote
"FOR" the proposal:

    - to issue Suiza's common stock to Dean's stockholders in the merger; and

               THE MERGER AND THE MERGER AGREEMENT (SEE PAGE 30)

    We have attached the merger agreement as Annex A to this joint proxy
statement/prospectus. We encourage you to read the merger agreement in its
entirety because it is the legal document that governs the merger.

WHAT DEAN'S STOCKHOLDERS WILL RECEIVE (SEE PAGE 39)

    Each of Dean's stockholders will receive, for each share of Dean's stock
held immediately prior to the merger, $21.00 in cash plus 0.429 shares of
Suiza's common stock, subject to adjustment if Suiza's stock price is below
$32.71 at the time of the merger (as further explained under this heading). Had
the merger occurred on April 4, 2001, the day the merger agreement was signed,
the total value received by each Dean stockholder would have been as follows:

    It is possible that the mix of cash and stock to be received by Dean's
stockholders could change. At the time we entered into the merger agreement, we
structured the merger in a way that we believe allows the merger to qualify as a
"tax-free reorganization" under federal tax laws. Assuming the merger qualifies
as a tax-free reorganization, if you are a Dean stockholder you will recognize
taxable gain equal to the lesser of (1) the amount of cash you receive in the
merger and (2) an amount equal to (a) the fair market value of the Suiza common
stock and cash that you receive in the merger minus (b) your tax basis (which is
generally equal to your cost) for the shares of Dean common stock that you are
exchanging in the merger.

    We have been advised that, in order for the merger to qualify as a tax-free
reorganization, the total value of the stock issued by Suiza to Dean's
stockholders in connection with the merger should be at least 40% of the total
purchase price paid by Suiza for all of Dean's outstanding common stock.
Therefore, in order to preserve the status of the merger as a "tax-free
reorganization," the merger agreement provides that if Suiza's stock price is
below a certain "threshold price" when the merger occurs, the mix of stock and
cash to be delivered to each Dean stockholder will change (without changing the
total value received by each stockholder). Each Dean stockholder would receive
more stock and less cash so that the stock portion of the purchase price
represents at least 40% of the total purchase price.

    The "threshold price" of Suiza's stock (below which the mix of cash and
stock to be received by Dean's stockholders will be adjusted) is $32.71,
assuming none of Dean's stockholders exercise dissenter's rights. If any of
Dean's stockholders exercise dissenter's rights, the "threshold price" will
increase slightly.

    The table below illustrates how the mix of cash and stock paid for each Dean
share would change if the price of Suiza's stock is below $32.71 when the merger
occurs, assuming $32.71 is the "threshold price."

                                                                PER DEAN SHARE

    Suiza will not issue any fractional shares of stock in the merger. If a Dean
stockholder would be entitled to a fractional share of stock, Suiza will instead
pay that stockholder the value of the fractional share in cash. In determining
that value, Suiza will assume that one whole share of stock is worth an amount
equal to the average closing price of Suiza's stock on the New York Stock
Exchange over the 10 trading day period ending two business days prior to the
date the merger occurs.

WHAT SUIZA'S STOCKHOLDERS WILL HOLD AFTER THE MERGER (SEE PAGE 42)

    Suiza's stockholders will not receive any cash or additional stock as a
result of the merger. They will simply continue to own their existing shares of
Suiza's stock after the merger. If you are a Suiza stockholder and you wish to
exchange your existing stock certificates after the merger for certificates that
bear Suiza's new name, you may send your certificates, after the merger, to
Suiza's transfer agent for exchange. Your new certificates will represent
exactly the same number of shares as your old certificates.

OWNERSHIP OF SUIZA AFTER THE MERGER (SEE PAGE 42)

    Suiza will issue approximately 15.3 million shares of common stock (which
would represent approximately 35% of the outstanding shares of Suiza's common
stock after the merger) to Dean's stockholders in the merger, not including
shares to be issued pursuant to stock-based awards outstanding under Dean's 1989
Stock Awards Plan. If all of the options currently outstanding under Dean's plan
were exercised at the time of the merger, Suiza would issue approximately
  million additional shares (assuming the closing price for Suiza's common stock
on the last day before the merger is the same as the closing price for Suiza's
stock on         , 2001, which was $    per share).

MANAGEMENT OF SUIZA AFTER THE MERGER (SEE PAGE 42)

    At the time of the merger, Howard Dean, Chairman of the Board and Chief
Executive Officer of Dean, will become Chairman of the Board of Suiza. Mr. Dean
will also join Suiza's Executive and Management Committees.

    Gregg Engles, current Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer of
Suiza, will retain his title of Chief Executive Officer of Suiza, and he will
re-assume the title of Chairman of the Board upon Mr. Dean's retirement in
June 2002. Suiza has agreed to expand the size of its board of directors from 10
to 15 upon completion of the merger, and to elect five persons appointed by Dean
and agreed upon by Suiza to fill the additional seats. See "The Merger and the
Merger Agreement--Management of Suiza After the Merger" on page   for a list of
those five persons. All of Suiza's current directors will remain on Suiza's
board of directors.

NAME CHANGE AND LISTING OF SUIZA'S COMMON STOCK (SEE PAGE 43)

    Suiza will change its name to "Dean Foods Company" when the merger occurs.
In connection with the name change, Suiza's trading symbol on the New York Stock
Exchange will change from "SZA" to "DF."

REGULATORY MATTERS AND DIVESTITURES (SEE PAGE 43)

    Under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976 (the HSR
Act), the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) and the Antitrust Division of the U.S.
Department of Justice (DOJ) have the right to study the legality of the merger
under the antitrust laws, prior to its consummation. On May 9, 2001, the DOJ
requested certain information and documentation from us in connection with their
review of the merger. We are currently in the process of responding to the
information requests, and expect to have substantially complied with the
requests by the end of July 2001. After we have provided them with the requested
information, the DOJ will have 30 days (or more time if we decide to grant them
an extension) to decide whether to commence litigation to prevent consummation
of the merger. If the DOJ believes that the merger will have adverse competitive
effects, it could commence legal action under the antitrust laws of the United
States seeking a court order to block the transaction altogether, to require
divestiture of various assets of Suiza or Dean, to place restrictions on the
combined company's operations after the merger or require other concessions or
other relief. Private parties (including individual states) may also bring legal
action under the antitrust laws.

    Prior to signing the merger agreement, we analyzed the effects of the
proposed merger under the antitrust laws. In an effort to resolve potential
antitrust concerns, Suiza agreed to transfer to Dairy Farmers of America, Inc.
(DFA), simultaneously with the occurrence of the merger, six plants located in
areas where our operations overlap. In exchange for the six plants and certain
other consideration, DFA will transfer its minority interest in Suiza Dairy
Group to Suiza. DFA has assigned its right to acquire the six plants to National
Dairy Holdings, LP (National Dairy), an entity in which DFA owns a

minority interest. Therefore, Suiza expects to transfer the six plants directly
to National Dairy. See "The Merger and the Merger Agreement--The Related
Transactions" on page 57.

    In addition to the merger, Suiza's transaction with DFA and Suiza's
transaction with National Dairy are subject to review by the DOJ under the HSR
Act prior to their consummation. On May 25, 2001, the DOJ requested certain
information and documentation from Suiza in connection with the DOJ's review of
the transaction between Suiza and DFA. Suiza is currently in the process of
responding to the information request, and expects to have substantially
complied with the request by the end of July 2001. After Suiza has provided the
DOJ with the requested information, the DOJ will have 30 days (or more time if
Suiza decides to grant them an extension) to decide whether to commence
litigation to prevent consummation of Suiza's transaction with DFA or to seek
other concessions or relief. Suiza and National Dairy have not yet received a
request for additional information from the DOJ regarding the transfer of the
six plants from Suiza to National Dairy. However, Suiza expects to receive a
request on or before July 20, 2001. Suiza is already in the process of gathering
information that it anticipates will be requested by the DOJ, and expects to be
in a position to promptly respond to the DOJ's information request. Once Suiza
and National Dairy have provided the DOJ with the requested information, the DOJ
will have 30 days (or more time if Suiza and National Dairy decide to grant them
an extension) to decide whether to commence litigation to prevent consummation
of Suiza's transaction with National Dairy or to seek other concessions or
relief.

    Assuming the divestiture of the six plants, we do not believe that the
merger will violate any antitrust laws. Similarly, we do not believe that either
Suiza's transaction with DFA or Suiza's transaction with National Dairy violates
any antitrust laws. However, we cannot assure you that a governmental agency or
private party will not challenge the merger or either of the related
transactions on antitrust grounds or, if they make a challenge, what the result
will be or how long it could take to resolve any such challenges. Specifically,
we could be required to divest more operations than we currently anticipate or
we could be forced to sell the six plants to someone other than National Dairy,
which could delay completion of the merger and/or lessen the expected benefits
of the merger to the combined company.

    Suiza and Dean have agreed to use reasonable best efforts to avoid or
eliminate all impediments to the merger raised under the antitrust laws by the
DOJ or any other regulator so that the merger may close as soon as possible, and
by December 31, 2001 at the latest. Specifically, we have agreed that we will
make any divestiture or take any other action that limits our ability to operate
any of our current businesses, product lines or assets, so long as the
divestiture or other action is conditioned on the closing of the merger and
would not, in Suiza's opinion, have a material adverse effect on the combined
company. We have also agreed to use reasonable best efforts to avoid or have
lifted any government-imposed restriction that would prevent or delay the merger
beyond December 31, 2001, even if it means defending through litigation any
claim brought by any party opposing the merger. See "The Merger and the Merger
Agreement--Additional Covenants in the Merger Agreement" on page 52.

TERMINATION OF THE MERGER AGREEMENT (SEE PAGE 47)

    CIRCUMSTANCES UNDER WHICH EITHER PARTY CAN TERMINATE THE MERGER
AGREEMENT.  Suiza and Dean could mutually agree to terminate the merger
agreement for any reason at any time. Either Suiza or Dean could also terminate
the merger agreement at any time if any one of the following events occurs:

    - the merger is not completed by December 31, 2001;

    - there is a governmental order that is final and nonappealable preventing
      the closing of the merger;

    - the other party's stockholders fail to give the required approval of the
      merger proposal; or

    - the other party breaches any of its representations, warranties, covenants
      or obligations under the merger agreement, and the breach is incapable of
      being cured, or is not cured, in all material respects, by December 31,

      recommendation in a manner adverse to Dean, or takes any action or makes
      any statement inconsistent with its recommendation; or

    - Dean's board of directors decides to sell its business to another buyer,
      because the other offer is (1) more favorable to Dean's stockholders from
      a financial point of view, (2) likely to be completed and (3) either
      accompanied by financing commitments or not subject to a financing
      contingency.

    EFFECTS OF TERMINATING THE MERGER AGREEMENT.  Dean must pay Suiza a
termination fee of $45 million in cash if:

    - The merger agreement is terminated by Suiza for one of the reasons listed
      under "The Merger and the Merger Agreement--Termination of the Merger
      Agreement--Additional circumstances under which Suiza can terminate the
      merger agreement";

    - The merger agreement is terminated by Dean as a result of Dean's board of
      directors deciding to sell its business to another buyer because the other
      offer is (1) more favorable to Dean's stockholders from a financial point
      of view, (2) likely to be completed and (3) either accompanied by
      financing commitments or not subject to a financing contingency; or

    - Dean receives a proposal from another buyer to buy Dean's business prior
      to termination of the merger agreement, AND THEN

     Suiza and Dean mutually agree to terminate the agreement or Suiza
     terminates the merger agreement because Dean breached a representation or
     covenant in the merger agreement and did not or could not cure it by
     December 31, 2001 or either party terminates the merger agreement because
     the merger is not completed by December 31, 2001 or either party terminates
     the merger agreement because the other party's stockholders failed to
     approve the merger proposals, AND THEN within 180 days after the
     termination, Dean enters into an agreement to sell 50% or more of its
     business to the other buyer.

    If Suiza terminates the merger agreement because Dean's stockholders fail to
approve the merger, Dean must reimburse Suiza for one-half of Suiza's expenses
incurred in connection with the merger, up to a maximum of $10 million. If the
merger agreement is terminated and Dean must pay Suiza a termination fee of
$45 million, Dean must also reimburse Suiza for all of Suiza's expenses incurred
in connection with the merger, up to a maximum of $15 million. If Dean
terminates the merger agreement because Suiza's stockholders fail to approve the
issuance of Suiza's common stock pursuant to the merger agreement, Suiza must
reimburse Dean for one-half of Dean's expenses incurred in connection with the
merger, up to a maximum of $10 million.

TREATMENT OF DEAN STOCK OPTIONS AND OTHER EQUITY INTERESTS (SEE PAGE 49)

    When the merger occurs, each outstanding option to acquire shares of Dean's
common stock will automatically convert into a fully exercisable option to
purchase a certain number of shares of Suiza's common stock. The conversion rate
for Dean's options will depend on the price of Suiza's stock when the merger
occurs. The exercise price of each outstanding option will also be adjusted. Had
the merger closed on             , 2001, an option to purchase 100 shares of
Dean's stock at $    per share would have been converted into an option to
purchase         shares of Suiza's stock at $    per share. All other terms and
conditions that currently apply to the Dean stock options will remain the same.
All other Dean stock-based awards automatically will convert into fully vested
awards with respect to Suiza's common stock based on the same conversion formula
as Dean's options.

MATERIAL FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSEQUENCES OF THE MERGER (SEE PAGE 53)

    For a discussion of the possible tax consequences of the merger to Dean's
stockholders, please see "The Merger and the Merger Agreement--Material Federal
Income Tax Consequences of the Merger" on page 53.

    Because Suiza's stockholders will not receive any cash or stock in the
merger, the merger will not cause Suiza's stockholders to recognize any taxable
gain or loss.

ACCOUNTING TREATMENT (SEE PAGE 54)

    The merger will be accounted for using the purchase method of accounting.

APPRAISAL RIGHTS (SEE PAGE 55)

    Each of Dean's stockholders has the right to a judicial appraisal of the
fair value of his or her shares under Delaware law. The procedure for perfecting
appraisal rights is described under the heading "The Merger and the Merger
Agreement--Appraisal Rights" on page 55. Suiza's stockholders do not have
appraisal rights.

THE RELATED TRANSACTIONS (SEE PAGE 57)

    In connection with the merger, Suiza has entered into an agreement with
Dairy Farmers of America, Inc. (DFA) to purchase DFA's 33.8% interest in Suiza
Dairy Group in exchange for:

    - approximately $165 million in cash, subject to adjustment as described in
      the agreement between Suiza and DFA;

    - a subordinated contingent promissory note in the original principal amount
      of $50 million payable only in the event that Suiza terminates or breaches
      one of its existing milk supply agreements with DFA prior to the twentieth
      anniversary of the merger date; and

    - six plants (and the operations associated with those plants) located in
      areas where Suiza's and Dean's operations overlap. DFA has assigned its
      right to acquire these plants to National Dairy Holdings, LP (National
      Dairy), an entity in which DFA owns a minority interest. Therefore, when
      the merger occurs, Suiza expects to transfer the six plants to National
      Dairy rather than to DFA.

    Also as part of the consideration to be paid to DFA, Suiza intends to amend
one of Suiza's current milk supply agreements with DFA to provide that if Suiza
does not, within a specified period after closing, offer DFA the right to supply
raw milk, or manage the supply of raw milk, to certain of Dean's dairy plants
after the merger, Suiza could be required to pay liquidated damages to DFA in an
amount of up to $80 million. Any such liquidated damages would be paid, without
interest, over a five-year

period and would reduce the principal amount of the $50 million contingent
promissory note described above by an amount equal to approximately 25% of such
payments.

    Suiza's proposed acquisition of DFA's minority interest in Suiza Dairy Group
is contingent on, and is expected to occur simultaneously with, the completion
of the merger. However, completion of the transaction with DFA is not a
condition to completion of the merger.

    References to "the related transactions" in this joint proxy
statement/prospectus are references to (1) Suiza's buy-out of DFA's interest in
Suiza Dairy Group, and (2) Suiza's transfer of the six plants to National Dairy
(as a result of DFA's assignment of its right to acquire such plants to National
Dairy).

    Both related transactions are subject to antitrust review under the
Hart-Scott-Rodino Act. See "Risk Factors--Risks Relating to the Merger--The
merger could be delayed if the related transactions fail to close" on page 23.

               COMPARATIVE MARKET PRICE INFORMATION (SEE PAGE 59)

    The following table sets forth the closing prices per share of Suiza's
common stock and Dean's common stock on the New York Stock Exchange composite
tape on April 4, 2001, the last trading day prior to the public announcement of
the proposed merger, and on             , 2001. The table also sets forth the
value of the Suiza common stock that a Dean stockholder would have received for
one Dean common share and the total value of the cash and Suiza common stock
that a Dean stockholder would have received for one Dean common share, assuming
that the merger had taken place on those dates and assuming that Dean's
stockholders will receive 0.429 shares of Suiza common stock and a cash payment
of $21.00 for each Dean share held. See "The Merger and the Merger Agreement--
What Dean's Stockholders Will Receive" on page 39.

    Set forth below are the income from continuing operations, cash dividends
and book value per common share data for Suiza on a historical basis and on a
pro forma consolidated basis and for Dean on a historical basis and on a pro
forma consolidated basis per Dean equivalent share.

    Dean's equivalent pro forma per share data was computed by multiplying
Suiza's pro forma per share data by the exchange ratio of 0.429 shares of Suiza
common stock for each share of Dean common stock.

    The information below should be read together with Suiza's and Dean's
historical financial statements and related notes contained in the annual
reports and other information that we have filed with the Securities and
Exchange Commission and incorporated by reference in this joint proxy
statement/prospectus and with the pro forma financial information beginning on
page 60. See "Where You Can Find More Information" on page 98. The pro forma
data shown below is unaudited and is presented for illustrative purposes only.
This information is not necessarily indicative of the historical results that
would have occurred had the companies always been combined or the future results
of the combined company after the merger and the related transactions. See
"Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Consolidated Financial Information" on page 60
for an explanation of the assumptions underlying the pro forma financial
information.

               SELECTED HISTORICAL FINANCIAL INFORMATION OF DEAN

    The following selected historical financial information has been derived
from Dean's audited consolidated financial statements as of and for each of the
years ended May 1996 through 2000. The historical financial information for the
nine months ended February 2001 and 2000 is unaudited and derived from the
condensed consolidated financial information included in Dean's Form 10-Q for
the quarter ended February 25, 2001; however, in the opinion of Dean's
management, all adjustments (consisting only of normal recurring adjustments)
necessary for a fair presentation have been made. This information is a summary
and should be read together with Dean's historical financial statements and
related notes contained in the annual reports and other information that Dean

                  OPINIONS OF FINANCIAL ADVISORS (SEE PAGE 68)

    In deciding to approve the merger, the boards of directors of each of Suiza
and Dean considered the opinions of their respective financial advisors as to
the fairness from a financial point of view of the consideration to be paid by
Suiza in the merger.

    On April 4, 2001, Goldman, Sachs & Co. delivered its oral opinion, which it
subsequently confirmed in a written opinion dated April 4, 2001, to Dean's board
of directors that, as of that date, the per share merger consideration to be
received by the holders of Dean common stock was fair from a financial point of
view to the holders of such shares. The opinion of Goldman Sachs does not
constitute a recommendation as to how any Dean stockholder should vote at Dean's
stockholder meeting.

    The full text of the written opinion of Goldman Sachs, dated April 4, 2001,
which sets forth assumptions made, matters considered and limitations on the
review undertaken in connection with the opinion, is contained in Annex B.
DEAN'S STOCKHOLDERS ARE URGED TO, AND SHOULD, READ THE OPINION IN ITS ENTIRETY.

    On April 4, 2001, Bear, Stearns & Co. Inc. and Morgan Stanley & Co.
Incorporated rendered their oral opinions, subsequently confirmed by each in
written opinions dated April 4, 2001, to Suiza's board of directors that, as of
that date, the per share merger consideration to be paid by Suiza pursuant to
the merger agreement was fair from a financial point of view to Suiza. The
opinions of Bear Stearns and Morgan Stanley were directed to Suiza's board of
directors, do not address any other aspect of the transaction and do not
constitute a recommendation as to how any Suiza stockholder should vote at
Suiza's stockholder meeting.

    The full texts of the written opinions of Bear Stearns and Morgan Stanley,
each dated April 4, 2001, which set forth assumptions made, matters considered
and limitations on the review undertaken in connection with the opinions, are
contained in Annexes C and D. SUIZA'S STOCKHOLDERS ARE URGED TO, AND SHOULD,
READ THE OPINIONS IN THEIR ENTIRETY.

            INTERESTS OF CERTAIN PERSONS IN THE MERGER (SEE PAGE 79)

    If you are a Dean stockholder, when you consider the recommendation of
Dean's board of directors that Dean's stockholders vote in favor of the merger
agreement and the merger, you should be aware that some of Dean's executive
officers and directors have interests in the merger that are different from your
own interests as a Dean stockholder. For example:

    - all stock options held by Dean's officers and directors will become
      immediately exercisable upon completion of the merger;

    - if the merger occurs, certain of Dean's officers (including Howard Dean,
      who is also on Dean's board of directors) will receive cash or stock
      awards under performance awards agreements issued pursuant to Dean's 1989
      Stock Awards Plan; and

    - certain of Dean's officers (including Mr. Dean) will receive substantial
      cash payments if their employment is terminated (voluntarily or
      involuntarily) at certain times following the merger.

The purpose of the Dean benefit programs giving rise to these interests is to
encourage Dean's officers and directors to continue serving Dean and working to
maximize stockholder value even though the pending merger may result in their
loss of employment or directorship or their diminished corporate position.

                  SUIZA'S OPTION PLAN PROPOSALS (SEE PAGE 83)

    Suiza believes that granting stock options to its key employees and
directors is an effective way to:

    - attract and retain the best available personnel for positions of
      substantial responsibility; and

    - align the interests of key employees and directors with those of Suiza's
      stockholders.

    Suiza believes that when its employees and directors own stock in the
company, they are motivated to promote the company's success. Therefore, a
significant portion of Suiza's key employees' overall compensation consists of
stock options.

    As a result of the significant number of additional employees that the
combined company will have after the merger occurs, the number of shares
currently available for issuance under Suiza's stock option plan will be
insufficient to meet the combined company's needs after the merger to
effectively create incentives for management of the larger company.

    Therefore, Suiza proposes to adopt Dean's 1989 Stock Awards Plan, if the
merger occurs, and make certain amendments to the plan as described under
"Suiza's Option Plan Proposals--Proposal to Adopt Dean's Stock Awards Plan" on
page 87. If this proposal is approved, Suiza will be authorized to issue up to
1,889,191 shares of its common stock pursuant to options or other stock awards
to be granted under the plan after the merger.

    Suiza also proposes to increase the number of shares reserved for issuance
under Suiza's existing stock option plan from 7.5 million shares to
     million shares, if the merger occurs. See "Suiza's Option Plan
Proposals--Proposal to Increase Suiza's Existing Option Plan" on page 85.

       STOCKHOLDER VOTES REQUIRED TO APPROVE THE PROPOSALS (SEE PAGE 88)

    For Suiza's stockholders:

    In order to approve each of:

    - the proposal to issue shares of Suiza's common stock to Dean's
      stockholders in the merger and to reserve a sufficient number of
      additional shares of Suiza's common stock for issuance pursuant to
      stock-based awards outstanding at the time of the merger under Dean's 1989
      Stock Awards Plan;

    - the proposal to approve Suiza's adoption of Dean's 1989 Stock Awards Plan
      and the reservation of 1,889,191 shares of Suiza's common stock for
      issuance after the merger pursuant to that plan, if the merger occurs; and

    - the proposal to increase the number of shares reserved for issuance under
      Suiza's stock option plan from 7.5 million to      million, if the merger
      occurs,

    holders of at least a majority of Suiza's stock with voting power present
    (in person or by proxy) at Suiza's stockholder meeting must vote "FOR" the
    particular proposal. As of       , 2001, directors and executive officers of
    Suiza and their affiliates were entitled to vote   shares of Suiza's common
    stock, which represented   % of Suiza's stock outstanding on             ,
    2001.

    For Dean's stockholders:

    In order to approve the proposal to approve the merger agreement and the
merger, holders of at least a majority of Dean's outstanding shares must vote
"FOR" the proposal. As of       , directors and executive officers of Dean and
their affiliates were entitled to vote             shares of Dean's common
stock, which represented   % of Dean's stock outstanding on             , 2001.

                                  RISK FACTORS

    This document, and the documents incorporated herein by reference, contain
statements about the future that are not statements of fact, but are merely
estimates. We believe that our estimates are based on reasonable assumptions.
Nevertheless, you should keep in mind that the statements are only estimates.
Actual results may differ materially and adversely. We claim protection for
ourselves in making these "forward-looking" statements under the "safe harbor"
for forward-looking statements provided by the Securities Litigation Reform Act
of 1995.

    The sections in this document which contain forward-looking statements
include this "Risk Factors" section as well as the sections entitled "Questions
and Answers," "Summary Information," "The Merger and the Merger
Agreement--Background of the Merger," "The Merger and the Merger
Agreement--Dean's Reasons for the Merger," "The Merger and the Merger
Agreement--Suiza's Reasons for the Merger," "Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed
Consolidated Financial Information" and "Opinions of Financial Advisors."
Forward-looking statements can be identified by words such as "believes,"
"expects," "anticipates," "intends," "estimates," "plans" or other similar
expressions. Some examples of the forward-looking statements in this document,
and in the documents incorporated herein by reference, include our statements
about:

    - The timing of the completion of proposed merger;

    - The amount of money that each of Suiza and Dean will spend on
      merger-related expenditures, and the timing of those expenditures;

    - The extent of divestitures or other relief that will be necessary to
      obtain regulatory approval for the merger and the related transactions;

    - Suiza's ability to obtain financing for the merger and the related
      transactions upon the terms contemplated;

    - The combined company's sales after the merger;

    - The impact we expect the proposed merger, and the related transactions, to
      have on the combined company's sales and earnings per share;

    - The combined company's ability to successfully integrate our businesses
      within the predicted timeframe;

    - The amount of cost savings and overall operational efficiencies we expect
      to realize as a result of the proposed merger and the related
      transactions;

    - The combined company's ability to implement and continue its branding
      initiatives and product innovations in a cost effective manner and to
      profit from those initiatives; and

    - Each of Suiza's and Dean's ability to meet stated financial goals prior to
      completion of the merger.

    In evaluating our forward-looking statements, and in deciding your vote, you
should carefully consider the risks outlined below, as well as the risks set
forth in Suiza's and Dean's filings with the SEC. See "Where You Can Find More
Information" on page 98.

RISKS RELATING TO THE MERGER

THE VALUE OF THE SUIZA SHARES AND THE AMOUNT OF CASH THAT DEAN'S STOCKHOLDERS
WILL RECEIVE IN THE MERGER DEPENDS ON SUIZA'S STOCK PRICE WHEN THE MERGER
OCCURS, SO DEAN'S STOCKHOLDERS MAY RECEIVE LESS VALUE AND/OR LESS CASH THAN THEY
CURRENTLY ANTICIPATE.

    The value of the Suiza stock to be received by Dean's stockholders, and the
number of Suiza's shares and the amount of cash that each Dean stockholder will
receive, will depend on Suiza's stock price at the time of the merger. The price
of Suiza's stock could be lower at the time of the merger than it is now or was
on April 4, 2001, the date the merger agreement was signed. For examples of how
the value of Suiza's stock to be received by Dean's stockholders, and the number
of shares and the amount of cash to be received, could change by the time of the
merger, see "The Merger and the Merger Agreement--What Dean's Stockholders Will
Receive" on page 39. We expect the merger to be completed during the third or
fourth calendar quarter of 2001. However, the exact timing of completion of the
merger will depend on when we receive regulatory approval for the merger.
Therefore, we cannot be certain when the merger will be completed, or if it will
be completed, and it could take substantially longer than we are expecting.

    There are many factors that could affect the price of Suiza's stock between
now and the time of the merger, many of which are beyond Suiza's control. These
factors include, among others, Suiza's and Dean's operating performance and
financial results between now and the time of the merger (especially as compared
to Suiza's and Dean's projected operating performance and financial results) and
market conditions generally. For more information about various factors that
could affect the companies' operating performance, and therefore Suiza's stock
price, between now and the time of the merger, see "Risk Factors--Risks Relating
to the Combined Company's Business" on page 25, and the other risks set forth in
Suiza's and Dean's filings with the SEC.

OBTAINING REQUIRED REGULATORY APPROVALS AND SATISFYING CLOSING CONDITIONS MAY
DELAY, PREVENT THE COMPLETION OF, OR SUBSTANTIALLY CHANGE THE PROJECTED BENEFITS
OF, THE MERGER.

    Completion of the merger is conditioned upon the expiration or termination
of the "waiting period" under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act
of 1976 and the absence of any governmental order prohibiting the closing of the
transaction or making it illegal, among other conditions. Obtaining regulatory
approval could delay the completion of the merger for a significant period of
time after Suiza's and Dean's stockholders have approved the merger. See "The
Merger and the Merger Agreement--Regulatory Matters and Divestitures" on
page 43 for a description of the regulatory approvals necessary in connection
with the merger. We cannot be certain when or if the required regulatory
approvals will be obtained, or when, or if, the other conditions to closing of
the merger will be satisfied.

    Generally, in order to proceed with the merger, we must first satisfy any
concerns that the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) might have regarding the
competitive effects of the merger. If the DOJ believes that the merger would
violate federal antitrust law by substantially lessening competition in any line
of commerce affecting U.S. consumers, they have the authority to challenge the
merger on antitrust grounds. The DOJ can challenge the merger by seeking a
federal court order temporarily and/or permanently blocking the transaction.
They may also challenge the merger after the merger is completed. We can give no
assurance as to the terms and conditions, if any, that we might be required to
comply with in order to satisfy any antitrust concerns that the DOJ, or any
court reviewing the merger, may have. If we are required to divest operations or
lines of business beyond our current expectations, the benefits of the merger
could be substantially diminished, which could have a material adverse affect on
the financial performance and prospects of the combined company after the
merger. Moreover, we can give no assurance that the DOJ will not attempt to
block the merger altogether, require divestiture of various assets of Suiza or
Dean, place restrictions on the combined company's

operations after the merger, or require other concessions or relief. We also
cannot assure you that any such attempts by the DOJ would not be successful.

    In certain circumstances, state antitrust enforcement officials or private
parties also have the ability to attempt to block the proposed transaction if
they have concerns about the competitive effects of the proposed transaction.
While state approval is not formally required, we can give no assurance that any
such challenge would not be successful.

SUIZA MAY NOT BE ABLE TO OBTAIN THE FINANCING NEEDED FOR THE MERGER ON FAVORABLE
TERMS.

    Suiza has received the commitments of certain lenders to provide financing
for the merger and the related transactions. See "The Merger and the Merger
Agreement--The Related Transactions" on page 57. However, the lenders that
provided the commitments have the right to decide not to actually fund the loan
if there is a material adverse change in the financial, banking or capital
markets generally or in Suiza's or Dean's business between now and the time of
the merger. If a material adverse change does occur, Suiza will be forced to
obtain an alternate source of financing, which may be more expensive for Suiza
and/or have an adverse impact on the combined company's capital structure or may
be unavailable on terms acceptable to Suiza.

THE MERGER COULD BE DELAYED IF THE RELATED TRANSACTIONS FAIL TO CLOSE.

    In connection with the merger, Suiza has agreed to purchase the minority
interest in Suiza Dairy Group, L.P. held by Dairy Farmers of America, Inc.
(DFA). As part of the purchase price for DFA's minority interest in Suiza Dairy
Group, Suiza has agreed to transfer to DFA the assets and related business
operations of six fluid milk processing plants located in areas where Suiza's
operations overlap with Dean's operations. DFA has assigned its right to acquire
these six plants to National Dairy Holdings, LP (National Dairy), an entity in
which DFA holds a minority interest. Therefore, Suiza expects to transfer the
six plants directly to National Dairy.

    Both Suiza's purchase of DFA's minority interest in Suiza Dairy Group and
Suiza's transfer of the six plants to National Dairy are subject to antitrust
review by the Department of Justice (DOJ) under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act. If
the DOJ believes that either transaction would violate federal antitrust law by
substantially lessening competition in any line of commerce affecting U.S.
consumers, it has the authority to challenge one or both of such transactions on
antitrust grounds by seeking to block one or both transactions altogether, or by
seeking various other remedies.

    We cannot be certain when or if regulatory approval for these transactions
will be obtained. Although the closing of these transactions is not a condition
to completion of the merger, a delay in obtaining regulatory approval could
delay completion of the merger. If the DOJ successfully blocks the transfer of
the six plants to National Dairy, or if the transfer of the six plants to
National Dairy fails to be completed for any other reason (such as delay by the
DOJ in approving the transaction), Suiza may be required to find another
purchaser for these plants, which could significantly delay the merger, have a
material adverse impact on the projected benefits of the merger to the combined
company and the combined company's expected financial performance after the
merger, adversely affect the terms on which Suiza can negotiate a sale of these
plants or result in the termination of the merger agreement if Suiza cannot find
another purchaser of the plants on acceptable terms by December 31, 2001.

WE MAY BE UNABLE TO SUCCESSFULLY INTEGRATE SUIZA'S AND DEAN'S OPERATIONS AND
REALIZE THE FULL BENEFITS THAT WE ANTICIPATE FROM THE MERGER.

    The merger involves the integration of two companies that have previously
operated independently. The difficulties of combining Suiza's and Dean's
businesses include:

    - maintaining customer relations so that the combined company does not
      suffer a loss of sales;

    - efficiently coordinating and rationalizing operations, including
      purchasing, production and distribution, among the various facilities of
      both companies in a way that allows the combined company to realize
      projected cost savings; and

    - integrating, retaining and optimizing diverse personnel resources,
      administrative structures and company cultures among various locations.

    Among the factors considered by Suiza's board of directors and Dean's board
of directors in connection with their approvals of the merger agreement were the
opportunities for economies of scale, operating improvements, improved customer
service, expanded product offerings and better marketing and distribution. We
cannot give any assurance that these benefits will be realized within the time
periods or to the extent contemplated. We could be required to invest more
capital than we are expecting or more time and effort by management than we are
expecting in order to realize the benefits we are projecting from the merger,
particularly in light of the operating difficulties that Dean has experienced
over the past year. The combination of our companies could even result in a loss
of certain customers if those customers believe they could get better service or
value from any of our competitors.

    If the combined company fails to effectively manage the integration of our
businesses and the improvement of Dean's business, the combined company's
operations and financial results after the merger will be affected, both
materially and adversely.

THIRD-PARTY RIGHTS COULD BE TRIGGERED BY THE MERGER AND REQUIRE AMENDMENT OR
RE-NEGOTIATION OF CERTAIN CONTRACTS.

    We may be required to re-negotiate or obtain waivers of contractual terms in
contracts with certain customers, suppliers, licensors and business partners in
order to continue the existing business operations of both companies following
the merger. Companies that license or supply products to or are partnered with
Suiza or Dean may compete with each other or with Suiza or Dean, and could
refuse to amend their contracts with Suiza or Dean to accommodate the merger, or
fail to agree to terms acceptable to Suiza or Dean. The failure of either
company to obtain waivers of any change-of-control provisions triggered by the
merger or other terms affected by the merger could give rise to termination or
other rights of the contracting party adverse to Suiza or Dean which could have
a material adverse impact on the combined company's operations following the
merger and negatively impact the expected benefits of the merger.

WE WILL INCUR SIGNIFICANT TRANSACTION EXPENSES AND INTEGRATION-RELATED COSTS IN
CONNECTION WITH THE MERGER TRANSACTION.

    Both Suiza and Dean will incur significant costs and expenses related to the
merger prior to closing (regardless of when or whether the merger is completed),
including costs incurred in attempting to obtain regulatory approval for the
transaction, fees paid to obtain financing commitments and various other
transaction costs. Also, a significant delay in the closing of the merger beyond
our current expectations could substantially burden the financial and management
resources of both companies, which could have an adverse effect on our
operations and/or financial results.

    If any of the conditions to closing contained in the merger agreement are
not timely satisfied in accordance with the terms of the merger agreement, the
merger agreement could be terminated and the transaction would not be completed
at all. In that case, both Suiza and Dean would have incurred significant costs
without achieving the expected benefits of the proposed merger. Suiza is
currently capitalizing its merger-related expenses, while Dean is currently
expensing all of its merger-related expenses. If the merger is not completed,
all costs incurred by Suiza in attempting to complete the merger would be
reflected as expenses on Suiza's consolidated income statement in the period
during

which the merger agreement is terminated, which would have a significant adverse
impact on Suiza's earnings per share in the period such costs are recorded.

    If the merger occurs, the combined company will incur charges to operations
to reflect costs associated with integrating the operations of the two
companies, and these charges could be substantial. Some of these costs may be
expensed after the closing of the merger and could adversely affect the results
of the combined company which could adversely impact the market price of Suiza's
common stock after the merger. Although Suiza and Dean expect that the
elimination of duplicative costs, as well as the realization of other
efficiencies related to the integration of the businesses, may offset additional
expenses over time, we cannot assure you that a net benefit will be achieved as
a result of the merger, in the near term or at all.

THE MERGER COULD CAUSE DILUTION TO THE COMBINED COMPANY'S EARNINGS PER SHARE.

    Although we expect the merger and the related transactions to be accretive
to the combined company's earnings after the merger, the merger and the related
transactions could have a dilutive effect if:

    - the costs of the transaction and integration-related costs exceed our
      expectations;

    - we fail to realize the expected benefits from synergies anticipated from
      the merger;

    - Suiza or Dean substantially underperforms prior to completion of the
      merger; or

    - the combined company substantially underperforms following the merger.

    Dilution to the combined company's earnings per share after the merger could
adversely affect the market price of the combined company's common stock.

RISKS RELATING TO THE COMBINED COMPANY'S BUSINESS

    As part of the purchase price for their Dean shares, Dean's stockholders
will receive shares of Suiza's common stock. Suiza's business is subject to a
number of risks and the combined company's business will continue to be subject
to those risks after completion of the merger. Dean's stockholders should
consider the following risks relating to the combined company's business in
deciding how to vote. Risks specific to Dean's business are not discussed in
this joint proxy statement/prospectus but are incorporated by reference to
Dean's filings with the SEC. See "Where You Can Find More Information" on
page 98.

THE COMBINED COMPANY'S FAILURE TO SUCCESSFULLY COMPETE COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT
ITS PROSPECTS AND FINANCIAL RESULTS.

    Suiza's business is subject to significant competition based on a number of
factors, and the combined company's business will continue to be subject to
significant competition after the merger. If the combined company fails to
successfully compete against its competitors, its business will be adversely
affected.

    Significant consolidation is currently underway in the retail grocery and
food service industries. As the combined company's customer base continues to
consolidate, we expect competition to further intensify as the combined company
competes for the business of fewer customers. As this consolidation continues,
there can be no assurance that the combined company will be able to keep Suiza's
and Dean's existing customers, or to gain new customers. Winning new customers
will be particularly important to the combined company's growth, as demand tends
to be relatively flat in our industry. Moreover, as our customers become larger,
they will have significantly greater purchasing leverage, and may force prices
and margins significantly lower than current levels.

    The combined company could also be adversely affected by any expansion of
capacity by its competitors or by new entrants in our markets. In addition,
dairy processors like Suiza and Dean are facing pressure from other beverage
companies seeking to expand their influence over consumer beverage choices.
These larger competitors may adversely affect the combined company in its fight
for shelf space and consumption of its products.

THE COMBINED COMPANY'S INNOVATION EFFORTS MAY NOT SUCCEED.

    Both Suiza and Dean have invested, and we intend to continue after the
merger to invest, significant resources in product innovation in an effort to
increase sales and profit margins as well as the overall consumption of dairy
products. We believe that innovation will be a significant source of growth in
the dairy industry. Innovation may help improve demand, which has been
relatively flat for a number of years. Further, innovation is particularly
important because we expect margins on non value-added dairy products to be
compressed as our customer base consolidates. The success of the combined
company's innovation initiatives will depend on customer and consumer acceptance
of its products, which could be adversely affected by recent efforts of other
beverage companies to offer alternative dairy and non-dairy products. We cannot
assure you that the combined company's innovation initiatives will be
successful. If these innovation efforts do not succeed, the combined company may
not be able to continue to significantly increase industry demand for our
products and our sales or profit margins.

INCREASES IN THE COMBINED COMPANY'S RAW MATERIAL AND SUPPLY COSTS COULD
ADVERSELY AFFECT THE COMBINED COMPANY'S FINANCIAL RESULTS.

    The most important raw materials that Suiza and Dean use in their operations
are raw milk and cream (including butterfat). These will continue to be the
combined company's primary raw materials after the merger. The prices of these
materials increase and decrease depending on supply and demand and, in some
cases, governmental regulation. Prices of raw milk and cream (including
butterfat) can fluctuate widely over short periods of time. This volatility in
the cost of raw materials could adversely affect the combined company's
performance.

    Also, because the combined company will deliver a majority of its products
directly to customers through its "direct store delivery" system the combined
company will be a large consumer of diesel fuel. Suiza experienced increased
fuel costs in 2000 and 2001 to date as a result of increased fuel prices. An
increase in fuel prices beyond our expectations could adversely affect the
combined company's results of operations.

    Consolidated Container Company, in which Suiza owns a 43.1% interest, uses
high density, polyethylene resin (HDPE) as its primary raw material. Due to
recent increases in the cost of petroleum products, Consolidated Container
incurred sharply increased costs for HDPE during 2000 and the first quarter of
2001, which adversely affected its results of operations for those periods and,
accordingly, Suiza's earnings per share for those periods. Consolidated
Container is also Suiza's primary supplier of plastic bottles. Pursuant to
Suiza's supply agreements with Consolidated Container, the price Suiza pays for
plastic bottles increases as the cost of HDPE increases. Suiza is adversely
affected by these cost increases to the extent they are not passed on to Suiza's
customers. Should the cost of HDPE rise even higher than expected, the combined
company's financial results, including its gross profit and earnings per share,
would be adversely affected.

THE COMBINED COMPANY WILL HAVE SUBSTANTIAL DEBT.

    Suiza has substantial debt and other financial obligations.

    If the merger is completed, the combined company will be even more highly
leveraged. Suiza intends to borrow approximately $750 million to pay the cash
portion of the purchase price for the merger, $165 million to pay the cash
portion of the purchase price for the related transactions (subject

to adjustment), and an additional amount to refinance certain of Dean's
indebtedness. Suiza has pledged the stock of some of its subsidiaries to secure
its existing debt, and the combined company will pledge a substantial portion of
its assets to secure the debt incurred in connection with the merger.

    The combined company's high debt level and new credit agreement will:

    - limit the combined company's ability to obtain additional financing in the
      future;

    - require the combined company to dedicate a significant portion of its cash
      flow to the payment of principal and interest on its debt, which reduces
      the funds it will have available for other purposes;

    - limit the combined company's flexibility in planning for, or reacting to,
      changes in business and market conditions;

    - impose additional financial and operational restrictions; and

    - expose the combined company to interest rate risk since a portion of its
      debt obligations will bear interest at variable rates.

    The combined company's ability to make scheduled payments on its debt and
other financial obligations will depend on its financial and operating
performance. Its financial and operating performance will be subject to
prevailing economic conditions and to financial, business and other factors,
some of which will be beyond the combined company's control. If the combined
company does not comply with the financial and other restrictive covenants under
its debt agreements, it may default under these agreements. Upon default, the
combined company's lenders could accelerate the indebtedness, foreclose against
their collateral or seek other remedies.

THE COMBINED COMPANY MAY BE SUBJECT TO PRODUCT LIABILITY CLAIMS.

    Suiza and Dean sell food products for human consumption, which involves
risks such as:

    - product contamination or spoilage;

    - product tampering; and

    - other adulteration of food products.

    Consumption of an adulterated, contaminated or spoiled product may result in
personal illness or injury. The combined company could be subject to claims or
lawsuits relating to an actual or alleged illness or injury, and the combined
company could incur liabilities that are not insured or that exceed the combined
company's insurance coverages.

    Although both Suiza and Dean maintain quality control programs designed to
address food quality and safety issues, an actual or alleged problem with the
quality, safety or integrity of our products at any of our facilities could
result in:

    - product withdrawals;

    - product recalls;

    - negative publicity;

    - reduced demand for our products;

    - temporary plant closings; and

    - substantial costs of compliance or remediation.

    Any of these events could have a material and adverse effect on the combined
company's financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.

LOSS OF RIGHTS TO ANY OF THE COMBINED COMPANY'S LICENSED BRANDS COULD ADVERSELY
AFFECT THE COMBINED COMPANY.

    Suiza and Dean sell a significant portion of their products under licensed
brand names, such as BORDEN-REGISTERED TRADEMARK-,
COFFEE-MATE-REGISTERED TRADEMARK-, HERSHEY'S-REGISTERED TRADEMARK-, LAND O'
LAKES-REGISTERED TRADEMARK-, NESQUIK-REGISTERED TRADEMARK- and
PET-REGISTERED TRADEMARK-. Should the combined company's rights to manufacture
and sell products under any of these names be terminated, the combined company's
financial performance and results of operations could be materially and
adversely affected.

NEGATIVE PUBLICITY AND/OR SHORTAGES OF MILK SUPPLY RELATED TO MAD COW DISEASE
AND/OR FOOT AND MOUTH DISEASE COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT THE COMBINED COMPANY.

    Recent incidences of bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE or "mad cow
disease") in some European countries have raised public concern about the safety
of eating beef and using or ingesting certain other animal-derived products. The
World Health Organization, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and the United
States Department of Agriculture have all affirmed that BSE is not transmitted
to milk. Moreover, recent incidences of mad cow disease have occurred primarily
in Europe. We are not aware of any cases of disease in humans or livestock
caused by BSE in the United States. However, we are still subject to risk as a
result of public misperception that milk products may be affected by mad cow
disease. To date, Suiza has not seen any measurable impact on its milk sales in
Spain, and neither Suiza nor Dean has seen any measurable impact on its milk
sales in the United States, resulting from concerns about mad cow disease.
However, should public concerns about the safety of milk or milk products
escalate as a result of further occurrences of mad cow disease, or if a case of
the disease is detected in the United States, the combined company could suffer
a loss of sales, which could have a material and adverse affect on its financial
results.

    Foot and Mouth Disease (FMD) is a highly contagious disease of cattle,
swine, sheep, goats, deer, and other cloven-hooved animals. FMD causes severe
losses in the production of meat and milk. While there have been several recent
occurrences of FMD in Europe, the United States has been free of FMD since 1929.
To date, Suiza has not seen a measurable impact on its supply of raw milk in
Spain as a result of FMD. However, should FMD become widespread in Spain, a milk
supply shortage could develop, which would affect Suiza's ability to obtain raw
milk for its Spanish operations and the price that it is required to pay for raw
milk in Spain. If Suiza is unable to obtain a sufficient amount of raw milk to
satisfy its Spanish customers' needs and/or if Suiza is forced to pay a
significantly higher price for raw milk in Spain, the combined company's
financial results in Spain could be materially and adversely affected. Likewise,
if there is an outbreak of FMD in the United States, a shortage of raw milk
could develop in the United States, which would affect the combined company's
ability to obtain raw milk and the price that the combined company is required
to pay for raw milk in the United States. If the combined company is unable to
obtain a sufficient amount of raw milk to satisfy its U.S. customers' needs
and/or if the combined company is forced to pay a significantly higher price for
raw milk in the United States, its consolidated financial results could be
materially and adversely affected.

CERTAIN PROVISIONS OF SUIZA'S CERTIFICATE OF INCORPORATION AND BYLAWS AND
DELAWARE LAW COULD DETER TAKEOVER ATTEMPTS.

    Some provisions in Suiza's certificate of incorporation and bylaws could
delay, prevent or make more difficult a merger, tender offer, proxy contest or
change of control of the combined company. Stockholders of the combined company
might view any such transaction as being in their best interests since the
transaction could result in a higher stock price of the combined company's
common stock. Among other things, Suiza's certificate of incorporation and
bylaws:

    - authorize Suiza's board of directors to issue preferred stock in series
      with the terms of each series to be fixed by Suiza's board of directors;

    - divide Suiza's board of directors into three classes so that only
      approximately one-third of the total number of directors is elected each
      year;

    - permit directors to be removed only for cause; and

    - specify advance notice requirements for stockholder proposals and director
      nominations.

    In addition, with certain exceptions, the Delaware General Corporation Law
will restrict mergers and other business combinations between the combined
company and any stockholder that acquires 15% or more of the combined company's
voting stock.

    Suiza also has a stockholder rights plan which will remain in place
following the merger. Under this plan, after the occurrence of specified events,
stockholders will be able to buy stock from the combined company at reduced
prices. These rights would not extend, however, to persons participating in
takeover attempts without the consent of the board of directors. Accordingly,
this plan could delay, defer, make more difficult or prevent a change of control
of the combined company.

THE COMBINED COMPANY WILL BE SUBJECT TO GOVERNMENTAL REGULATIONS, AND ITS
OPERATIONS AND PROFITABILITY COULD BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY CHANGES IN
REGULATIONS OR NEW REGULATIONS.

    Our operations are subject to federal, foreign, state and local governmental
regulation, and will continue to be after the merger. While Suiza and Dean each
believes that it is in compliance with all material existing governmental
regulations, future material noncompliance by the combined company, or any
material changes in these laws and regulations, could adversely affect the
combined company's ability to operate its business as currently conducted or the
profitability of its operations.

    Under the Federal Milk Marketing Order program, the federal government and
several state agencies establish minimum regional prices paid to producers for
raw milk. These prices, which are calculated by economic formula based on supply
and demand, vary depending on the type of product manufactured using the raw
milk. In New England, the Northeast Dairy Compact Commission sets a minimum
price for milk independent of the price set by the federal milk marketing
orders. The price Suiza pays for raw milk in New England currently exceeds the
price Suiza pays for raw milk in other parts of the country, and we expect that
to continue to be the case after the merger. Other states have considered
adopting compacts among milk producers which would establish minimum prices paid
by milk processors, including the combined company, to raw milk producers in
those states. We do not know whether new compacts will be authorized by Congress
or, if authorized, the extent to which these compacts would increase the prices
the combined company will be required to pay for raw milk. A substantial
increase in the price the combined company is required to pay for raw milk
beyond its expectations could have an adverse effect on the combined company's
results of operations, to the extent those increases are not passed on to
customers. Moreover, even if those costs are passed on to customers, the
combined company could suffer a loss of sales if the price of processed milk and
other dairy products rises beyond the price that the combined company's
customers and consumers are willing to pay.

    The combined company, like others in similar businesses, will also be
subject to a variety of federal, foreign, state and local environmental laws and
regulations including, but not limited to, those regulating waste water and
stormwater, air emissions, storage tanks and hazardous materials.

    Suiza and Dean believe that both companies are currently in material
compliance with all applicable laws and regulations. Future developments,
including increasingly stringent regulations, could require the combined company
to make currently unforeseen expenditures to comply with changed or new
regulations, which could have an adverse effect on the combined company's
results of operations.

                      THE MERGER AND THE MERGER AGREEMENT

    The following summary of the merger and the merger agreement is qualified by
reference to the complete text of the merger agreement. The merger agreement is
incorporated by reference and attached as Annex A.

BACKGROUND OF THE MERGER

    For the last several years, management of Suiza has considered Dean to be a
logical merger partner, primarily because of Suiza's and Dean's complementary
distribution capabilities and product mix. In early 1998, Dean began to explore
various strategic and financial options aimed at increasing stockholder value.
At that time, Suiza and Dean held discussions concerning the possibility of a
business combination. In connection with those discussions, Suiza and Dean
entered into a confidentiality agreement which included a three-year standstill
provision, and conducted limited due diligence, including mutual management
presentations. Suiza and Dean terminated their negotiations in February 1998
primarily due to differences over integration and management succession issues.

    In early 2000, after Suiza acquired Southern Foods, Mr. Dean and Mr. Engles
again began to discuss a merger of the two companies. Although Suiza and Dean
identified a number of benefits to such a combination, the discussions again
stalled.

    In March 2000, Dean retained Goldman, Sachs & Co. to assist Dean in
connection with a possible transaction with Suiza or another entity, and in
consideration of various other financial alternatives available to Dean.

    By late 2000, Suiza began to view Dean as vulnerable to takeover in light of
Dean's then-current market valuation and certain management succession issues
that Suiza perceived at Dean. During the first weekend of December 2000,
Mr. Dean and Mr. Engles attended a social event hosted by Dairy Farmers of
America (DFA). During that weekend, Mr. Engles asked Mr. Dean whether Dean would
be interested in discussing a possible business combination. Mr. Dean indicated
that he had been considering various strategic alternatives for Dean, and that,
given Dean's then current outlook, the timing might be right to again consider a
business combination with Suiza. Mr. Engles and Mr. Dean agreed to meet to
explore the possibility of a transaction.

    On January 26, 2001, at a regularly scheduled meeting, Dean's board of
directors discussed various strategic alternatives for Dean, including the
possibility of a business combination with Suiza. Mr. Dean reviewed his recent
discussions with Mr. Engles, and Goldman Sachs discussed certain transaction
alternatives with the board. Dean's board authorized Mr. Dean to continue
discussions with Suiza.

    On January 31, 2001, Mr. Engles, Mr. Dean and another executive of Suiza met
to further discuss the possibility of a business combination. At the meeting,
Mr. Dean outlined the basic terms on which Dean's board of directors would
consider a combination with Suiza. Mr. Engles and Mr. Dean agreed to arrange a
meeting of their financial advisors to further explore the possibility of a
combination.

    On February 6, 2001, Suiza's and Dean's financial advisors met to discuss
possible terms of a transaction between Suiza and Dean. At that meeting, the
advisors agreed that certain due diligence must be completed before either
company could further consider the transaction.

    Also during January and February 2001, Suiza held several discussions with
DFA, owner of approximately 33.8% of Suiza Dairy Group, concerning the
possibility of a business combination between Suiza and Dean. During Suiza's
discussions with DFA concerning the possible transaction with Dean, Suiza and
DFA agreed that it would not be feasible for Suiza to proceed with the merger
unless Suiza owned 100% of its dairy operations. Therefore, Suiza and DFA began
discussing possible scenarios pursuant to which Suiza would purchase DFA's
interest in Suiza Dairy Group.

    On February 8, 2001, at a meeting held in Dallas, executives of Suiza
advised their board of directors of Suiza's discussions with Dean. Suiza's board
of directors authorized management to continue discussions with Dean.

    On February 9, 2001, Suiza and Dean signed a confidentiality agreement which
included a two-year standstill provision. Shortly thereafter, Dean began
delivering preliminary due diligence information to Suiza. At that time, Suiza
also began considering various structuring issues related to the merger, and
began discussing with its lenders and financial advisors various financing
alternatives for the transactions with Dean and DFA. As Suiza's review of the
due diligence materials provided by Dean progressed, Suiza, with the assistance
of its financial advisors, began to form a preliminary opinion concerning the
value to Suiza of Dean's shares.

    On February 13, 2001, during a special meeting of Dean's board, Dean's
management reported that forecasted earnings for Dean's third quarter and full
fiscal year would likely be below analysts' expectations. Dean's board,
management and financial advisors discussed the impact of the anticipated
earnings shortfall on a potential transaction with Suiza. The next day,
Mr. Dean called Mr. Engles to advise him that Dean would not meet projected
earnings targets for the third and fourth quarters of 2001.

    On February 21, 2001, executives of Suiza and Dean, accompanied by their
financial advisors, met to discuss Suiza's preliminary due diligence findings
and Dean's current and projected financial performance. Mr. Engles indicated to
Mr. Dean that he expected to submit an offer to acquire Dean after obtaining the
approval of Suiza's directors.

    On February 22, 2001, at a special meeting, Dean's directors were briefed by
Dean's management and financial advisors regarding the due diligence meetings
and discussions with Suiza's executives on the previous day.

    Also on February 22, 2001, at a regularly scheduled meeting, executives of
Suiza, together with Suiza's legal and financial advisors, discussed with
Suiza's board the status of Suiza's discussions with Dean, the results of
Suiza's preliminary due diligence investigation, and the preliminary price offer
that Suiza intended to deliver to Dean, subject to further due diligence.
Suiza's board authorized management to make the offer and to continue its due
diligence review. Suiza's legal counsel also presented an analysis of antitrust
issues relating to a combination of Suiza and Dean.

    On February 27, 2001, Suiza, through its financial advisors, delivered its
preliminary price offer to Dean, subject to further due diligence.

    On February 28, 2001, Dean's management and advisors briefed Dean's board
over the telephone on the terms and conditions of Suiza's offer to purchase
Dean.

    On March 5, 2001, at a meeting of Dean's board of directors, Dean's
management and financial advisors described the terms and conditions of Suiza's
purchase offer. Dean's outside legal advisors also reviewed the fiduciary duties
of the directors in connection with the possible sale of the company. Dean's
board also discussed potential synergies from a combination with Suiza, the
proposed timetable for the merger, expected market reaction and strategic
alternatives to the Suiza offer.

    On March 9, 2001, Dean issued a press release announcing that it would not
meet projected earnings targets for the third and fourth fiscal quarters of 2001
and that it had hired Goldman Sachs to assist it in evaluating various strategic
and financial alternatives.

    On March 12, 2001, various executives and representatives of Suiza visited
Dean to conduct further due diligence. On March 13, 2001, as part of the due
diligence process, Suiza's management and Dean's management made presentations
to each other regarding their businesses. Also that week, various executives and
representatives of Dean visited Suiza to begin a due diligence investigation
concerning Suiza's business.

    Throughout March, Suiza's discussions with DFA concerning the terms of
Suiza's buy-out of DFA's interest in Suiza Dairy Group continued. Also
throughout March, Suiza continued its discussions with various commercial
lenders regarding obtaining a commitment for financing for the proposed
transaction, met with certain rating agencies and discussed with communications
professionals Suiza's merger communications plan in the event that an agreement
should be reached between Suiza and Dean.

    On March 20, 2001, Suiza delivered an initial draft of a merger agreement to
Dean.

    On March 21, 2001, Suiza's board of directors held a special meeting. At
that meeting, Suiza's executives and legal and financial advisors discussed with
the board the status of Suiza's discussions with Dean, the results of Suiza's
due diligence investigation and Suiza's financial advisors' recommendations
concerning valuation. Suiza's board of directors decided on a definitive price
offer, and authorized management to deliver the definitive offer and to continue
negotiations with Dean.

    On March 22, 2001, Suiza, through its financial advisors, delivered its
definitive offer to Dean.

    On March 23, 2001, Dean's board of directors held a regularly scheduled
meeting. Dean's management and financial advisors reviewed with the board the
status of their discussions with Suiza, the proposed transaction structure,
financing issues, key contractual terms and due diligence findings as well as
expressions of interest from other parties. Dean's legal counsel also presented
an analysis of antitrust issues relating to a combination of Dean and Suiza.
Dean's board authorized management to continue discussions with Suiza with the
objective of negotiating a final agreement.

    On March 26, 2001, Mr. Dean and Mr. Engles, accompanied by their financial
advisors, met to negotiate the draft merger agreement and to discuss various
management and integration issues. Mr. Engles and Mr. Dean reached agreement on
several key points, and agreed that Mr. Engles, Mr. Dean, other Suiza and Dean
executives and their legal and financial advisors would meet in Dallas on
March 28, 2001 to finalize the merger agreement. During the meeting held on
March 28, Suiza and Dean reached an impasse concerning the consideration to be
paid by Suiza and other key issues, and the companies suspended their merger
discussions.

    On March 29, 2001, Dean's board met and was briefed by Dean's management and
financial and legal advisors regarding the companies' discussions in Dallas.
Dean's advisors reviewed with the board the contractual issues that had not been
resolved, Suiza's proposed agreement with DFA for divestiture of certain Suiza
and Dean plants, DFA's proposed agreement with National Dairy Holding, LP
(National Dairy) assigning DFA's interest in those plants to National Dairy and
the effect of such agreements on a combination of Dean and Suiza. The board
authorized Dean's management and advisors to resume discussions with Suiza.

    On March 30, 2001, Mr. Dean called Mr. Engles. During that conversation,
they reached agreement on several material provisions of the merger agreement,
and agreed to continue discussions through their executives and advisors to
finalize the merger agreement. Also that day, Suiza's board of directors
convened a special meeting to discuss the proposed transaction. Suiza's
management updated Suiza's board on the status of its discussions with Dean, DFA
and Suiza's commercial lenders. Suiza's board authorized management to continue
its negotiations with Dean and agreed to meet again on April 4, 2001 to consider
approving the final transaction.

    From March 30 to April 1, 2001, Suiza's and Dean's executives and advisors
continued negotiating the merger agreement, and Suiza's executives and advisors
continued negotiating the purchase agreement with DFA and the commitment letters
for Suiza's proposed financing.

    On April 2, 2001, Mr. Dean and Mr. Engles, accompanied by certain other
executives and their advisors, met in an attempt to resolve the remaining
material terms of the merger agreement. They

reached agreement on most of the material terms and agreed to attempt to
finalize and sign the agreement on April 4.

    On April 3, 2001, Dean's board of directors met to discuss the previous
days' negotiations between Dean and Suiza. Dean's legal advisors explained the
resolution of the key contractual issues and reviewed the status of Suiza's
related agreements with DFA and DFA's proposed agreement with National Dairy.
Dean's financial advisors also discussed with the board contacts from unrelated
third parties who might have a potential interest in acquiring Dean or a portion
of Dean's assets.

    On April 4, 2001, the merger agreement negotiations were completed. Also on
that day, Suiza's agreement with DFA was finalized and Suiza reached agreement
with its lenders concerning the terms of their financing commitments.

    Also on April 4, 2001, Dean's board of directors met to consider the
proposed merger with Suiza, and approved the merger and the merger agreement.
See "--Dean's Reasons for the Merger" below for a discussion of matters
considered and actions taken at this meeting.

    Also on April 4, 2001, Suiza's board of directors met to consider the
proposed merger with Dean and the proposed transaction with DFA, and approved
both transactions. See "--Suiza's Reasons for the Merger" on page 37 for a
discussion of matters considered and actions taken at this meeting.

    On the evening of April 4, 2001, Suiza received the signed commitments of
its commercial lenders to provide financing for the proposed transactions. Suiza
and Dean then signed the merger agreement and exchanged signature pages. Suiza
also signed the purchase agreement with DFA and the parties exchanged signature
pages.

    On the morning of April 5, 2001, Suiza and Dean issued a joint press release
announcing the proposed merger.

DEAN'S REASONS FOR THE MERGER

    Dean's board of directors approved the merger agreement and the merger by a
unanimous vote of all members. In the course of reaching its decision to approve
the merger agreement and the merger, Dean's board of directors consulted with
Dean's management, as well as its outside legal counsel and its financial
advisor. At its meeting on April 4, 2001, Dean's board of directors unanimously:

    - Determined that the merger is fair and in the best interests of Dean and
      its stockholders and that the cash consideration, the exchange ratio and
      the per share merger consideration is fair from a financial point of view
      to Dean's stockholders;

    - Approved the merger agreement and the merger;

    - Directed that the merger agreement be submitted for consideration by
      Dean's stockholders; and

    - Recommended that Dean's stockholders vote "FOR" the proposal to approve
      the merger agreement and the merger.

    Dean's board of directors identified and considered a variety of potential
positive factors in its deliberations concerning the merger agreement and the
merger, including the following:

    - Dean's and Suiza's financial condition, results of operations, business
      quality, prospects and businesses as separate entities and on a combined
      basis, including:

         -- The revenues, cash flows and operating margins of Dean, Suiza and
            the combined company; and

         -- The recent and historical stock price performance of Dean's common
            stock and Suiza's common stock;

    - the strategic nature of the merger and increased opportunity for growth;

    - the greater financial strength expected to enable the combined company to
      increase research and development expenditures to develop new innovative
      products and increase demand for and consumption of their milk and related
      products;

    - the other potential benefits of scale to be derived from a combination of
      Dean and Suiza, including the expected cost savings and efficiencies,
      improved operating margins, enhanced marketing and sales support, improved
      distribution capabilities and greater ability to serve the rapidly
      consolidating national retail grocery and food services industries;

    - the likely market position and competitiveness resulting from a
      combination of Dean and Suiza, the complementary operating strengths and
      compatible business strategies of the two companies, the potential for
      synergies from a combination of the companies and the resulting potential
      to increase stockholder value;

    - Suiza's demonstrated ability to implement its growth strategy and
      integrate its acquisitions successfully and Suiza's ability to access
      capital markets to fund its growth;

    - Suiza's proven management team;

    - the fact that five persons (including Howard Dean) to be agreed upon by
      Suiza and Dean prior to completion of the merger will be elected to fill
      five new seats on Suiza's board of directors after the merger;

    - the fact that Mr. Dean will become Chairman of the board of directors of
      the combined company and a member of its executive and management
      committees after the merger is completed;

    - the fact that, although Dean did not actively auction its business, Dean
      had publicly announced on March 8, 2001 that it had retained Goldman,
      Sachs & Co. to explore strategic and financial alternatives and did not
      receive any proposals from any other company to merge with or acquire Dean
      or any other attractive proposals for any other transaction with Dean;

    - the possible alternatives to the merger, including continuing to operate
      Dean as an independent company and the associated risks in light of
      (1) Dean's failure to meet quarterly earnings expectations for 8 out of
      the 12 fiscal quarters preceding the approval of the merger agreement,
      (2) the difficulties Dean has experienced in integrating several of its
      recent acquisitions, (3) the competitive pressures Dean has faced and
      expects to continue to face from other dairy and non-dairy beverage
      companies, (4) the steady decline in milk consumption nationwide and
      (5) Howard Dean's planned retirement and Dean's concerns about identifying
      a clear successor capable of effectively leading Dean's business as a
      stand-alone company;

    - the opportunity for Dean's stockholders to participate in a larger company
      and, as stockholders of the combined company, to participate in any
      increases in the value of its businesses following the merger;

    - the fact that the exchange ratio would enable Dean's stockholders after
      the merger to own approximately 36% of the common stock of the combined
      company (on a diluted basis assuming exercise of only the outstanding
      Suiza and Dean options) or approximately 30% of the common stock of the
      combined company (on a diluted basis assuming the exercise of outstanding
      Suiza and Dean options and conversion of Suiza's mandatorily redeemable
      convertible trust issued preferred securities);

    - the intrinsic value and historical market prices of Dean's common stock
      and the fact that the cash consideration and the exchange ratio (based on
      Suiza's trading price at the close of business on April 3, 2001, the last
      trading day before Dean's board of directors approved the merger
      agreement) to be paid by Suiza in the merger together represented a
      premium of 25.7% to Dean's trading price at the close of business on
      April 3, 2001;

    - the directors' belief that the consideration to be paid by Suiza in the
      merger represented the highest price per share that could be negotiated
      with Suiza;

    - the presentation by Goldman, Sachs & Co. to Dean's board of directors on
      April 4, 2001, including the oral opinion of Goldman, Sachs & Co.
      presented to Dean's board of directors to the effect that, as of April 4,
      2001, the per share merger consideration to be received by Dean
      stockholders in the merger was fair from a financial point of view (See
      "Opinions of Financial Advisors--Opinion of Dean's Financial Advisor" on
      page 68);

    - the likely ability to complete the merger as a reorganization for United
      States federal income tax purposes in which Dean stockholders generally
      would not recognize any gain or loss, except for any gain or loss realized
      in connection with the cash component of the merger consideration and any
      cash received for fractional shares of Suiza's common stock (See
      "--Material Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger" on page 53);

    - the financial and non-financial terms and conditions of the merger
      agreement, including:

         -- the merger consideration;

         -- the fact that the closing condition requiring the accuracy of Dean's
            representations in the merger agreement generally excludes any
            inaccuracies that would not have a material adverse effect on Dean;

         -- the fact that Suiza's obligation to complete the merger is not
            conditioned on Suiza's receipt of any financing or on Suiza's
            purchase of the 33.8% limited partnership interest in Suiza Dairy
            Group, held by Dairy Farmers of America, as described under the
            heading "--The Related Transactions" on page 57;

         -- the right of Dean's board of directors, in connection with the
            discharge of their fiduciary duties to Dean and its stockholders or
            in response to certain unsolicited alternative acquisition
            proposals, to withdraw, modify or qualify its recommendation to
            Dean's stockholders to approve the merger agreement and pursue a
            competing transaction with another party, and the financial
            consequences of such withdrawal, modification or qualification;

         -- the absence of any right of Suiza to terminate the merger agreement
            if the value of a share of Suiza common stock rises above any
            particular level prior to the consummation of the merger; and

         -- the fact that Suiza will be required to reimburse Dean for one-half
            of Dean's expenses incurred in connection with the merger, up to a
            maximum of $10 million, if Dean terminates the merger agreement
            because Suiza's stockholders fail to approve the merger; and

    - the belief that the terms of the merger agreement, including Suiza's and
      Dean's representations, warranties and covenants, and the conditions to
      their respective obligations, are reasonable.

    Dean's board of directors also identified and considered a variety of
potential negative factors in its deliberations concerning the merger agreement
and the merger, including the following:

    - the risk that the potential benefits sought in the merger might not be
      fully realized;

    - the possibility that the merger might not be consummated and the potential
      adverse effects of the public announcement of the merger on:

         -- Dean's sales and operating results,

         -- Dean's ability to attract and retain key employees, and

         -- Dean's overall competitive position;

    - the risk that key personnel might not remain employees of the combined
      company following the merger;

    - the absence of any right of Dean to terminate the merger agreement if the
      value of Suiza's common stock falls below any particular level prior to
      the merger;

    - the impact of the loss of Dean's status as an independent company on
      Dean's stockholders, employees, suppliers and customers;

    - the fact that Dean will be required to reimburse Suiza for one-half of
      Suiza's expenses incurred in connection with the merger, up to a maximum
      of $10 million, if Suiza terminates the merger agreement because Dean's
      stockholders fail to approve the merger agreement; and

    - the fact that Suiza does not have an investment grade debt rating.

    Dean's board of directors specifically considered that the inclusion in the
merger agreement of the covenant prohibiting any solicitation by Dean of
alternative acquisition proposals and the $45 million termination fee and up to
$15 million expense reimbursement provisions were each a prerequisite to Suiza's
willingness to enter into the transaction. Dean's board of directors considered
that while these provisions might have the effect of discouraging other offers,
Dean's board of directors retained the ability to negotiate with third parties
expressing an unsolicited interest in Dean after the announcement of the
transaction, and Dean's board of directors determined that the benefits to
Dean's stockholders of securing an agreement with Suiza outweighed any potential
detriment.

    The discussion in this section about the information and factors considered
by Dean's board of directors is not intended to be exhaustive but Dean believes
it includes all material factors considered by Dean's board of directors. In
view of the complexity and wide variety of information and factors, both
positive and negative, considered by Dean's board of directors, Dean's board of
directors did not find it practical to quantify, rank or otherwise assign
relative or specific weights to the factors considered. In addition, Dean's
board of directors did not reach any specific conclusion with respect to each of
the factors considered, or any aspect of any particular factor, but, rather,
conducted an overall analysis of the factors described above, including thorough
discussions with Dean's management and legal and financial advisors. In
considering the factors described above, individual members of Dean's board of
directors may have given different weight to different factors. Dean's board of
directors considered all these factors as a whole and believed the factors
supported its decision to approve the merger agreement and the merger. After
taking into consideration all of the factors described above, Dean's board of
directors concluded that the merger was fair to, and in the best interests of,
Dean and its stockholders and that Dean should proceed with the merger.

RECOMMENDATION OF DEAN'S BOARD OF DIRECTORS

    Dean's board of directors believes that the merger is fair and in the best
interests of Dean and its stockholders and unanimously recommends that Dean's
stockholders vote "FOR" the proposal to approve the merger agreement and the
merger.

DEAN'S COVENANT TO RECOMMEND

    The merger agreement requires Dean's board of directors to recommend
adoption of the merger agreement and the merger to Dean's stockholders. However,
Dean's board of directors is permitted to withdraw or change its recommendation
prior to approval of the merger by Dean's stockholders if Dean's board of
directors determines in good faith, after consultation with its outside counsel,
that it is required to take such action to satisfy its fiduciary duties and Dean
has not breached its non-solicitation duties as described below under
"--Solicitation Restriction on Dean" on page 46.

SUIZA'S REASONS FOR THE MERGER

    Suiza's board of directors believes that the merger will create significant
value for Suiza's stockholders by enabling them to participate in a combined
company with enhanced prospects for growth and profitability. Set forth below
are a few of the reasons why Suiza is proposing the merger:

    - Suiza and Dean have complementary product offerings and geographic reach.
      Merging our businesses will create the first truly national dairy and
      specialty food company with the geographic reach, management depth and
      product mix necessary to grow and compete effectively against larger, more
      diversified food and beverage companies. Together, we will be better
      positioned to meet the needs of our customers, including our large
      national customers who would benefit from the added service, convenience
      and value that a national dairy company could provide.

    - By combining Suiza and Dean, Suiza expects to further reduce costs, which
      will allow Suiza to become more efficient and, therefore, to compete more
      effectively.

    - After the merger, Suiza will have greater resources to invest in
      innovation and marketing. Suiza believes that innovation is critical to
      increased sales and increased consumption, which should benefit the entire
      industry. Increased marketing should help to increase sales.

    At a meeting of Suiza's board of directors held on April 4, 2001, after due
consideration, Suiza's board of directors unanimously took the following
actions, among others:

    - determined that the merger is in the best interest of Suiza and its
      stockholders and that the amount of cash and stock to be delivered to
      Dean's stockholders under the merger agreement is fair from a financial
      point of view to Suiza;

    - approved the merger agreement;

    - approved the issuance and reservation of a sufficient number of shares of
      common stock to comply with Suiza's obligations under the merger
      agreement;

    - approved the indebtedness that Suiza expects to incur in order to pay the
      cash portion of the purchase price for the merger and the related
      transactions;

    - approved the conversion of all outstanding options to acquire shares of
      Dean's stock into options to acquire shares of Suiza's stock in accordance
      with the merger agreement;

    - directed that the proposal to issue Suiza's stock to Dean's stockholders
      and to reserve sufficient shares to permit the exercise of all converted
      Dean stock-based awards pursuant to the merger agreement be submitted to a
      vote of Suiza's stockholders;

    - recommended that Suiza's stockholders vote "FOR" the merger proposal;

    - approved the change of Suiza's name to Dean Foods Company upon closing of
      the merger;

    - approved an increase in the size of Suiza's board from 10 to 15, and
      resolved to agree with Dean on designees to fill those seats at the time
      of the merger and to appoint Howard Dean as Chairman of the Board and a
      member of the Executive Committee of the Board and a member of Suiza's
      management committee until his retirement in June 2002; and

    - approved the transaction with Dairy Farmers of America.

    In approving the transaction and making its recommendation, Suiza's board of
directors consulted with Suiza's management as well as its internal and external
legal counsel and its financial advisors, and it carefully considered the
following material factors:

    - the strategic nature of the merger, including the potential for enabling
      Suiza to better serve customers and the increased opportunities for growth
      that could result from the merger;

    - Suiza's ability after the merger to invest greater amounts in research and
      development in an effort to increase sales and consumption of dairy
      products by developing new and innovative products;

    - various expected cost savings and efficiencies;

    - the potential impact of the proposed merger and the related transaction on
      Suiza's projected financial results, capital structure, and stock price;

    - certain potential adverse effects including potential losses of customers
      or other business relationships;

    - Suiza's demonstrated ability to successfully integrate businesses;

    - with respect to the price to be paid to Dean's stockholders:

         -- Dean's financial condition, recent and projected results of
            operations, business quality and prospects;

         -- Dean's recent and historical stock price performance;

         -- the value of certain of Dean's brands and investments; and

         -- the presentations by Bear, Stearns & Co. Inc. and Morgan Stanley &
            Co. Incorporated to Suiza's board of directors on April 4, 2001,
            including their opinions that, as of April 4, 2001, the per share
            merger consideration to be paid by Suiza was fair from a financial
            point of view to Suiza, as well as the data, assumptions and
            analysis underlying the opinions;

    - certain other terms and conditions of the merger agreement, such as:

         -- Suiza's right to terminate the merger agreement upon a material
            adverse change in Dean's business, operations, assets, financial
            condition or results of operations, taken as a whole;

         -- Dean's agreement not to solicit other bids for Dean or to accept
            unsolicited bids unless the Dean stockholder meeting has not yet
            occurred and the other offer is superior to Suiza's (meaning that it
            is more favorable to Dean's stockholders from a financial point of
            view), is likely to close and is either accompanied by financing
            commitments or not subject to a financing contingency; and

         -- Dean's agreement to pay Suiza a $45 million fee if (1) Suiza
            terminates the merger agreement under certain circumstances, or
            (2) Dean terminates the merger agreement as a result of its
            acceptance of a superior offer or if Dean sells 50% or more of its
            business to another buyer (see "--Solicitation Restriction on Dean"
            on page 46 and "--Termination of the Merger Agreement" on page 47);

    - the likelihood of obtaining regulatory approval for the transaction, the
      likely timeframe for receiving such approval, the possible actions that
      Suiza might be required to take in order to receive such approval, the
      advisability of agreeing in advance to divest certain plants, and which
      plants to divest;

    - the financial and non-financial terms of the proposed financing for the
      merger and the related transactions; and

    - certain corporate governance and management succession issues.

    In view of the number and wide variety of factors considered in connection
with its evaluation of the merger and the complexity of these matters, Suiza's
board of directors did not find it practicable to, nor did it attempt to,
quantify, rank or otherwise assign relative weights to the specific factors that
it considered. Suiza's board of directors considered the separate opinions of
Bear Stearns and Morgan Stanley that, as of April 4, 2001, the per share merger
consideration to be paid by Suiza was fair from a financial point of view to
Suiza. See "Opinions of Financial Advisors--Opinions of Suiza's Financial
Advisors" on page 72. In addition, Suiza's board of directors did not undertake
to make any specific determination as to whether any particular factor, or any
aspect of any particular factor, was favorable or unfavorable to Suiza's board
of directors' ultimate determination or assign any particular weight to any
factor, but rather Suiza's board of directors conducted an overall analysis of
the factors described above, including thorough discussions with and questioning
of Suiza's management and legal and financial advisors. In considering the
factors described above, individual members of Suiza's board of directors may
have given different weight to different factors. Suiza's board of directors
considered all these factors as a whole, and considered the factors, in the
aggregate, to be favorable to Suiza and to support its determination to
recommend the merger and related stock issuance.

RECOMMENDATION OF SUIZA'S BOARD OF DIRECTORS

    Suiza's board of directors believes that the terms of the merger agreement
are fair to and in the best interests of Suiza and its stockholders and
unanimously recommends to its stockholders that they vote "FOR" the proposal to
approve:

    - the issuance of Suiza's common stock in the merger; and

    - the reservation of an additional number of shares of Suiza's common stock
      for issuance pursuant to stock-based awards outstanding at the time of the
      merger under Dean's 1989 Stock Awards Plan.

SUIZA'S COVENANT TO RECOMMEND

    Suiza's board of directors is required to recommend approval of the merger
proposal to you. Suiza's board of directors is permitted to withdraw or change
this recommendation, however, if Dean withdraws or changes its recommendation to
its stockholders.

STRUCTURE OF THE MERGER

    When the merger occurs, Dean will merge into Blackhawk, a direct
wholly-owned subsidiary of Suiza, with Blackhawk being the surviving
corporation, and Blackhawk's name will be changed to Dean Dairy Company.
Effectively, as a result of the merger, Dean will become a wholly-owned
subsidiary of Suiza.

WHAT DEAN'S STOCKHOLDERS WILL RECEIVE

    Each of Dean's stockholders will receive, for each share of Dean's stock
held immediately prior to the merger, $21.00 in cash plus 0.429 shares of
Suiza's common stock, subject to adjustment if Suiza's stock price is below
$32.71 at the time of the merger (as further explained under this heading). Had

the merger occurred on April 4, 2001, the day the merger agreement was signed,
the total value received by each Dean stockholder would have been as follows:

                                                                PER DEAN SHARE

    It is possible that the mix of cash and stock to be received by Dean's
stockholders could change. At the time we entered into the merger agreement, we
structured the merger in a way that we believe allows the merger to qualify as a
"tax-free reorganization" under federal tax laws. Assuming the merger qualifies
as a tax-free reorganization, if you are a Dean stockholder, you will recognize
taxable gain equal to the lesser of (1) the amount of cash you receive in the
merger and (2) an amount equal to (a) the fair market value of the Suiza common
stock and cash that you receive in the merger minus (b) your tax basis (which is
generally equal to your cost) for the shares of Dean common stock that you are
exchanging in the merger.

    We have been advised that, in order for the merger to qualify as a tax-free
reorganization, the total value of the stock issued by Suiza to Dean's
stockholders in connection with the merger should be at least 40% of the total
purchase price paid by Suiza for all of Dean's outstanding common stock.
Therefore, in order to preserve the status of the merger as a "tax-free
reorganization," the merger agreement provides that if Suiza's stock price is
below a certain "threshold price" when the merger

occurs, the mix of cash and stock to be delivered to each Dean stockholder will
change (without changing the total value received by such stockholder). Each
Dean stockholder would receive more stock and less cash so that the stock
portion of the purchase price represents at least 40% of the total purchase
price.

    The "threshold price" of Suiza's stock (below which the mix of stock and
cash to be received by Dean's stockholders will be adjusted) is $32.71, assuming
none of Dean's stockholders exercise dissenter's rights. If any of Dean's
stockholders exercise dissenter's rights, the "threshold price" will increase
slightly.

    The table below illustrates how the mix of cash and stock paid for each Dean
share would change if the price of Suiza's stock is below $32.71 when the merger
occurs, assuming $32.71 is the "threshold price."

                                                                PER DEAN SHARE

    The final mix of cash and stock will be determined on the day of the merger,
and we will issue a press release on that day announcing the final per share
amounts of cash and stock to be paid in the merger.

    Any shares of Dean's common stock owned by Dean at the time of the merger
will be canceled without any payment for those shares.

    If, prior to the time the merger occurs, Suiza's common stock or Dean's
common stock is changed into a different number of shares or different class by
reason of any stock dividend, stock split or similar event, the per share merger
consideration will be appropriately adjusted to provide Dean's stockholders with
the same economic effect as contemplated by the merger agreement.

    Suiza will not issue any fractional shares of stock in the merger. If a Dean
stockholder would be entitled to a fractional share of stock, Suiza will instead
pay that stockholder the value of the fractional share in cash. In determining
that value, Suiza will assume that one whole share of stock is worth an amount
equal to the average closing price of Suiza's common stock on the New York Stock
Exchange over the 10 trading day period ending two business days prior to the
date the merger occurs.

EXCHANGE OF SHARES

    When the merger occurs, Suiza will deposit with a designated exchange agent:

    - the shares of Suiza common stock issuable in exchange for all outstanding
      Dean common stock; and

    - cash sufficient to pay the cash portion of the merger consideration to
      Dean's stockholders.

    Suiza will then cause the exchange agent to mail to Dean's stockholders
instructions for exchanging their shares. When a Dean stockholder surrenders its
shares of Dean's stock to the exchange agent according to the exchange agent's
instructions, it will be entitled to receive Suiza common stock and cash in the
amounts described under "--What Dean's Stockholders Will Receive" on page 39. No
interest will be paid or accrue on the cash portion of the merger consideration.
One year after the merger, the exchange agent will return all remaining shares
and funds to Suiza and any remaining unexchanged shares of Dean common stock may
be surrendered to Suiza in exchange for the merger consideration, without
interest, after that time.

    Dean stockholders who do not exchange their shares will not be entitled to
receive any cash or other distributions payable by Suiza on the Suiza shares
that they would be entitled to receive in the merger until the applicable Dean
shares are surrendered. Upon surrender and subject to applicable laws, however,
those holders will promptly receive distributions already paid to Dean
stockholders who exchanged their shares, without interest, together with cash in
lieu of fractional shares and, at the appropriate payment date, any dividends
and distributions with a record date after the effective date of the merger but
a payment date after surrender of that holder's shares of Dean common stock.

WHAT SUIZA'S STOCKHOLDERS WILL HOLD AFTER THE MERGER

    Suiza's stockholders will not receive any cash or stock in connection with
the merger. They will simply continue to hold the shares of Suiza's stock they
currently own. If Suiza stockholders wish to exchange their existing stock
certificates after the merger for certificates that bear Suiza's new name, they
may send their certificates, after the merger, to Suiza's transfer agent for
exchange. The new certificates will represent exactly the same number of shares
as your old certificates.

OWNERSHIP OF SUIZA AFTER THE MERGER

    Suiza will issue approximately 15.3 million shares of common stock (which
would represent approximately 35% of the outstanding shares of Suiza's common
stock after the merger) to Dean's stockholders in the merger, not including
shares to be issued pursuant to stock-based awards outstanding at the time of
the merger under Dean's 1989 Stock Awards Plan. If all of the options currently
outstanding under Dean's plan were exercised at the time of the merger, Suiza
would issue approximately     million additional shares (assuming the closing
price for Suiza's common stock on the last day before the merger is the same as
the closing price for Suiza's stock on            , 2001, which was $  per
share).

MANAGEMENT OF SUIZA AFTER THE MERGER

    At the time of the merger, Howard Dean, the current Chairman of the Board
and Chief Executive Officer of Dean, will become Chairman of the Board of Suiza.
Mr. Dean will also join Suiza's Executive and Management Committees. Gregg
Engles, the current Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer of Suiza,
will retain his title of Chief Executive Officer of Suiza, and he will re-assume
the title of Chairman of the Board upon Mr. Dean's retirement in June 2002.
Suiza's board of directors has approved a five-seat increase in the size of its
board of directors, effective when the merger occurs. Suiza has agreed to elect
the following five individuals (who were selected by Dean) to fill those five
seats:

    Howard M. Dean, age 64, has been Chairman of Dean's board of directors since
1989. Mr. Dean has served as Dean's Chief Executive Officer since 1987 and
Dean's President and Chief Operating Officer from 1970 to 1989. Mr. Dean also
has served as a director of Ball Corporation (a diversified manufacturer of
containers and hi-tech products) since 1984 and Yellow Corporation (a nationwide
common carrier) since 1987. Mr. Dean has been a director of Dean since 1970 and
is Chairman of the Executive Committee of Dean's board of directors.

    Lewis M. Collens, age 63, is President of Illinois Institute of Technology
and Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of IIT Research Institute and has
served in such capacity since 1990. Mr. Collens was Dean of IIT Chicago-Kent
College of Law from 1974 to 1980 and has been a director of AMSTED Industries (a
manufacturer of components for the railroad and construction industries) since
1991. Mr. Collens has served as a director of Dean since December 1991, is
currently serving as Chairman of the Audit Committee of Dean's board of
directors and is a member of the Corporate Governance Committee of Dean's board
of directors.

    Janet Hill, age 53, is Vice President of Alexander & Associates (a corporate
consulting firm) and has served in such capacity since 1981. Ms. Hill has also
served as a director of Wendy's

International, Inc. (a restaurant corporation) since 1995, Progressive
Corporation (an insurance company) since 1996, Nextel Communications, Inc. (a
wireless communications company) since 1999 and Houghton Mifflin Company (a
publishing company) since 2000. Ms. Hill has been a director of Dean since 1997
and is a member of the Audit Committee of Dean's board of directors.

    John S. Llewellyn, Jr., age 66, has been retired since 1997. Before his

Spray Cranberries, Inc. (marketing cooperative of cranberry and citrus growers)
from 1988 to 1997. Mr. Llewellyn has been a director of Paging Network, Inc. (a
wireless messaging and information delivery company) since 1997 and a director
of Dean since 1994. Mr. Llewellyn serves as a member of the Compensation and
Corporate Governance Committees of Dean's board of directors.

    J. Christopher Reyes, age 47, is Chairman of Reyes Holdings, L.L.C. (a
private food and beverage distribution company) and has served in such capacity
since 1976. Mr. Reyes also has served as a director of Wintrust Financial
Corporation (a financial services holding company) since 1997. Mr. Reyes has
served as a director of Dean since 1999 and is a member of the Audit Committee
of Dean's board of directors.

    Messrs. Collens and Reyes will be elected for a term expiring at the first
annual meeting after the merger, Ms. Hill and Mr. Llewellyn will be elected for
a term expiring at the second annual meeting after the merger, and Mr. Dean will
be elected for a term expiring at the third annual meeting after the merger. All
of Suiza's current directors will remain on Suiza's board of directors.

    Suiza's existing management will remain in place after the merger.

NAME CHANGE AND LISTING OF SUIZA'S COMMON STOCK

    Suiza will change its name to "Dean Foods Company" when the merger occurs.
In connection with the name change, Suiza's trading symbol on the New York Stock
Exchange will change from "SZA" to "DF."

TIMING OF CLOSING

    The closing will occur after the conditions set forth in the merger
agreement have been satisfied or waived, unless Suiza and/or Dean terminate the
merger agreement or agree to a different date. On the closing date, we will
file a certificate of merger with the Secretary of State of the State of
Delaware and make all other filings or recordings required under the Delaware
General Corporation Law, at which time the merger will be effective.

REGULATORY MATTERS AND DIVESTITURES

    Under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976 (the HSR
Act), the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) and the Antitrust Division of the U.S.
Department of Justice (DOJ) have the right to study the legality of the merger
under the antitrust laws, prior to its consummation. On May 9, 2001, the DOJ
requested certain information and documentation from us in connection with their
review of the merger. We are currently in the process of responding to the
information requests, and expect to have substantially complied with the
requests by the end of July 2001. After we have provided them with the requested
information, the DOJ will have 30 days (or more time if we decide to grant them
an extension) to decide whether to commence litigation to prevent consummation
of the merger. If the DOJ believes that the merger will have adverse competitive
effects, it could commence legal action under the antitrust laws of the United
States seeking a court order to block the transaction altogether, to require
divestiture of various assets of Suiza or Dean, to place restrictions on the
combined company's operations after the merger or require other concessions or
other relief. Private parties (including individual states) may also bring legal
action under the antitrust laws.

    Prior to signing the merger agreement, we analyzed the effects of the
proposed merger under the antitrust laws. In an effort to resolve potential
antitrust concerns, Suiza agreed to transfer to Dairy Farmers of America, Inc.
(DFA), simultaneously with the occurrence of the merger, six plants located in
areas where our operations overlap. In exchange for the six plants and certain
other consideration, DFA will transfer its minority interest in Suiza Dairy
Group to Suiza. DFA has assigned its right to acquire the six plants to National
Dairy Holdings, LP (National Dairy), an entity in which DFA owns a minority
interest. Therefore, Suiza expects to transfer the six plants directly to
National Dairy. See "--The Related Transactions" on page 57.

    In addition to the merger, both Suiza's transaction with DFA and Suiza's
transaction with National Dairy are subject to review by the DOJ under the HSR
Act prior to their consummation. On May 25, 2001 the DOJ requested certain
information and documentation from Suiza in connection with the DOJ's review of
the transaction between Suiza and DFA. Suiza is currently in the process of
responding to the information request, and expects to have substantially
complied with the request by the end of July 2001. After Suiza has provided the
DOJ with the requested information, the DOJ will have 30 days (or more time if
Suiza decides to grant them an extension) to decide whether to commence
litigation to prevent consummation of Suiza's transaction with DFA or to seek
other concessions or relief. Suiza and National Dairy have not yet received a
request for additional information from the DOJ regarding the transfer of the
six plants from Suiza to National Dairy. However, Suiza expects to receive a
request on or before July 20, 2001. Suiza is already in the process of gathering
information that it anticipates will be requested by the DOJ, and expects to be
in a position to promptly respond to the DOJ's information request. Once Suiza
and National Dairy have provided the DOJ with the requested information, the DOJ
will have 30 days (or more time if Suiza and National Dairy decide to grant them
an extension) to decide whether to commence litigation to prevent consummation
of the Suiza's transaction with National Dairy or to seek other concessions or
relief.

    Assuming the divestiture of the six plants, we do not believe that the
merger will violate any antitrust laws. Similarly, we do not believe that either
Suiza's transaction with DFA or Suiza's transaction with National Dairy violates
any antitrust laws. However, we cannot assure you that a governmental agency or
private party will not challenge the merger or either of the related
transactions on antitrust grounds or, if they make a challenge, what the result
will be or how long it could take to resolve any such challenges. Specifically,
we could be required to divest more operations than we currently anticipate or
we could be forced to sell the six plants to someone other than National Dairy,
which could delay completion of the merger and/or lessen the expected benefits
of the merger to the combined company.

    Suiza and Dean have agreed to use reasonable best efforts to avoid or
eliminate all impediments to the merger raised under the antitrust laws by the
DOJ or any other regulator so that the merger may close as soon as possible, and
by December 31, 2001 at the latest. Specifically, we have agreed that we will
make any divestiture or take any other action that limits our ability to operate
any of our current businesses, product lines or assets, so long as the
divestiture or other action is conditioned on the closing of the merger and
would not, in Suiza's opinion, have a material adverse effect on the combined
company. We have also agreed to use reasonable best efforts to avoid or have
lifted any government-imposed restriction that would prevent or delay the merger
beyond December 31, 2001, even if it means defending through litigation any
claim brought by any party opposing the merger. See "--Additional Covenants in
the Merger Agreement" on page 52.

      or any of its subsidiaries that has a material adverse effect on Suiza;
      and

    - Dean must receive, at the time of the merger, the written opinion of its
      outside tax counsel that the merger qualifies as a tax-free reorganization
      (see "--Material Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger" on
      page 53).

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES IN THE MERGER AGREEMENT

    The merger agreement contains substantially reciprocal representations and
warranties of Suiza and Dean as to, among other things:

    - the due organization, valid existence and good standing of the companies
      and their subsidiaries;

    - each company's capital structure;

    - each company's authority to enter into the merger agreement and complete
      the merger;

    - required consents from government entities and the absence of conflicts
      with material agreements;

    - each company's compliance with laws;

    - the accuracy of each company's reports filed with the SEC;

    - the accuracy of each company's financial statements;

    - the absence of certain adverse changes or events;

    - full disclosure of liabilities;

    - litigation;

    - employee benefits matters;

    - tax matters;

    - each company's compliance with the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act;

    - environmental matters;

    - required stockholder approvals;

    - broker's or finder's fees;

    - the applicability of certain takeover provisions of state law;

    - each company's insurance;

    - each company's material contracts;

    - each company's principal customers and suppliers;

    - each company's intellectual property;

    - the opinions of each company's financial advisors;

    - each company's rights agreements; and

    - the accuracy of the information supplied for use in this joint proxy
      statement/prospectus.

    Suiza also represented and warranted (1) as to having obtained certain
lenders' commitments to provide financing for the cash portion of the purchase
price for the merger and the related transactions, and (2) as to Blackhawk's
absence of business activities since its incorporation.

    Many of the representations and warranties in the merger agreement are
qualified by a material adverse effect standard, which, for purposes of the
merger agreement, means any change or effect that, individually or when taken
together with all other such changes or effects, would be materially adverse to
the business, operations, assets, financial condition, or results of operations
of the company making the representation and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole.
None of the following will be taken into account in determining whether there
has been a material adverse effect: (1) any change in the market price or
trading volume of the capital stock of the company making the representation
after April 4, 2001, the date of the merger agreement; (2) the suspension of
trading in securities on the NYSE; (3) any adverse change, event, development or
offset arising from or relating to general business or economic conditions, or
general business or economic conditions relating to any industries in which the
company making the representation participates, if it is not specific to the
company making the representation; and (4) any adverse change, event,
development or effect arising from or relating to any change in U.S. generally
accepted accounting principles.

    The representations and warranties in the merger agreement will not survive
the merger.

SOLICITATION RESTRICTION ON DEAN

    Dean has agreed that it and its officers, directors, employees, agents and
representatives will not pursue an alternative business combination transaction.
Prohibited actions include each of the following:

    - initiating, soliciting, encouraging or facilitating any inquiry or offer
      relating to (1) a merger, business combination or other similar
      transaction involving Dean or any of its significant subsidiaries,
      (2) any purchase or sale of 10% or more of Dean's consolidated assets or
      (3) any purchase or sale of or tender offer for Dean's common stock that
      would result in any person owning 20% or more of the total voting power of
      Dean or any of its significant subsidiaries;

    - having any discussions with or providing any information to any person
      relating to such a transaction;

    - approving or recommending such a transaction; and

    - entering into any letter of intent or other agreement relating to such a
      transaction.

    Dean also agreed in the merger agreement to immediately terminate any
ongoing discussions relating to any such transaction.

    Dean is permitted, however, to take any of the above actions in response to
an unsolicited bona fide written offer if:

    - Dean's stockholder meeting has not occurred;

    - Dean has not breached the prohibitions described under this heading;

    - Dean's board of directors determines in good faith, after consultation
      with outside counsel, that it is required to do so to discharge its duties
      under Delaware law or Dean's board of directors concludes in good faith
      that the third party proposal is reasonably likely to result in a proposal
      to Dean's stockholders that is superior to the merger with Suiza, meaning
      that it is (1) more favorable to Dean's stockholders than the merger from
      a financial point of view, (2) likely to be completed, and (3) either
      accompanied by financing commitments or not subject to a financing
      contingency;

    - Dean receives from the other party an executed confidentiality agreement
      containing terms customary for such transactions; and

    - Dean notifies Suiza of the name of the person making the unsolicited
      written offer, and the material terms and conditions of the offer, prior
      to providing any information or data or entering into discussions with the
      third party.

    Dean may not sign any agreement, letter of intent or similar document
accepting any unsolicited or other third party offer, and may not submit to the
vote of its stockholders any proposal to approve an alternative acquisition
transaction, until after the merger agreement is terminated in accordance with
its terms.

    After Dean's stockholder meeting, if the merger is approved, Dean will not
be permitted to accept any alternative business combination proposal, even if
the alternative proposal is unsolicited and/or is, in the opinion of Dean's
board of directors, superior to the proposed merger with Suiza, unless Dean pays
Suiza a $45 million termination fee and reimburses Suiza for all of Suiza's
expenses incurred in connection with the merger, up to a maximum of
$15 million.

TERMINATION OF THE MERGER AGREEMENT

    CIRCUMSTANCES UNDER WHICH EITHER PARTY CAN TERMINATE THE MERGER
AGREEMENT.  Suiza and Dean could mutually agree to terminate the merger
agreement for any reason at any time. Either Suiza or Dean could also terminate
the merger agreement at any time if any one of the following occurs:

    - the merger is not completed by December 31, 2001;

    - there is a governmental order that is final and nonappealable preventing
      the closing of the merger;

    - the other party's stockholders fail to give the required approval of the
      merger proposal; or

    - the other party breaches any of its representations, warranties, covenants
      or obligations under the merger agreement, and the breach is incapable of
      being cured, or is not cured, in all material respects, by December 31,
      2001.

    ADDITIONAL CIRCUMSTANCES UNDER WHICH SUIZA CAN TERMINATE THE MERGER
AGREEMENT.  Suiza can also terminate the merger agreement if:

    - Dean's board of directors fails to call Dean's special stockholder meeting
      in accordance with the merger agreement;

    - Dean's board of directors fails to recommend to Dean's stockholders that
      they vote for the merger;

    - Dean's board of directors withdraws, modifies or qualifies its
      recommendation in a manner adverse to Suiza, or takes any action or makes
      any statement inconsistent with its recommendation; or

    - Dean enters into an agreement to sell its business, or control of its
      business, to another buyer.

    ADDITIONAL CIRCUMSTANCES UNDER WHICH DEAN CAN TERMINATE THE MERGER
AGREEMENT.  Dean can also terminate the merger agreement if:

    - Suiza's board of directors fails to call Suiza's special stockholder
      meeting in accordance with the merger agreement;

    - Suiza's board of directors fails to recommend to Suiza's stockholders that
      they vote for the issuance of Suiza's common stock pursuant to the merger
      agreement;

    - Suiza's board of directors withdraws, modifies or qualifies its
      recommendation in a manner adverse to Dean, or takes any action or makes
      any statement inconsistent with its recommendation; or

    - Dean's board of directors decides to sell its business to another buyer,
      because the other offer is (1) more favorable to Dean's stockholders from
      a financial point of view, (2) likely to be completed and (3) either
      accompanied by financing commitments or not subject to a financing
      contingency.

    EFFECTS OF TERMINATING THE MERGER AGREEMENT.  Dean must pay Suiza a
termination fee of $45 million in cash if:

    - the merger agreement is terminated by Suiza for one of the reasons listed
      above under "--Additional circumstances under which Suiza can terminate
      the merger agreement";

    - the merger agreement is terminated by Dean as a result of Dean's board of
      directors deciding to sell its business to another buyer because the other
      offer is (1) more favorable to Dean's stockholders from a financial point
      of view, (2) likely to be completed and (3) either accompanied by
      financing commitments or not subject to a financing contingency; or

    - Dean receives a proposal from another buyer to buy Dean's business prior
      to termination of the merger agreement, AND THEN

      Suiza and Dean mutually agree to terminate the agreement OR Suiza
      terminates the merger agreement because Dean breached a representation or
      covenant in the merger agreement and did not or could not cure it by
      December 31, 2001 OR either party terminates the merger agreement because
      the merger is not completed by December 31, 2001 OR either party
      terminates the merger agreement because the other party's stockholders
      failed to approve the merger proposals, AND THEN

      within 180 days after the termination, Dean enters into an agreement to
      sell 50% or more of its business to the other buyer.

    If Suiza terminates the merger agreement because Dean's stockholders fail to
approve the merger, Dean must reimburse Suiza for one-half of Suiza's expenses
incurred in connection with the merger, up to a maximum of $10 million. If the
merger agreement is terminated and Dean must pay Suiza a termination fee of
$45 million, Dean must also reimburse Suiza for all of Suiza's expenses incurred
in connection with the merger, up to a maximum of $15 million. If Dean
terminates the merger agreement because Suiza's stockholders fail to approve the
merger, Suiza must reimburse Dean for one-half of Dean's expenses incurred in
connection with the merger, up to a maximum of $10 million.

FEES AND EXPENSES

    Except as described above under "--Termination of the Merger
Agreement--Effects of Terminating the Merger Agreement" on page 48, Suiza and
Dean will pay all their own costs and expenses in connection with the merger
agreement and merger, except that:

    - Blackhawk will pay any and all transfer taxes imposed in connection with
      the merger;

    - Suiza and Dean will share equally expenses relating to independent third
      party analyses of cost savings and operational synergies; and

    - Suiza and Dean will share equally expenses incurred for filing, printing
      and mailing this joint proxy statement/prospectus.

    We estimate that the aggregate transaction costs incurred by Suiza and Dean
in connection with the merger (excluding Suiza's financing fees and related
expenses) will total approximately $58 million.

    Dean's transaction costs will total approximately $27 million, including
approximately $11 million which will be payable regardless of whether the merger
is completed. Dean's transaction costs will consist primarily of fees and
expenses for investment bankers, attorneys, accountants and other professionals,
and financial printing and other related charges.

    Suiza's transaction costs (excluding Suiza's financing fees and related
expenses) will total approximately $31 million, including approximately
$19 million which will be payable regardless of whether the merger is completed.
Suiza's transaction costs consist primarily of fees and expenses for investment
bankers, attorneys, accountants and other professionals, filing fees, stock
exchange listing fees, and financial printing and other related charges. In
addition, Suiza estimates that its financing fees and related expenses will
total approximately $46 million, a substantial portion of which will be payable
regardless of whether the merger is completed.

TREATMENT OF DEAN STOCK OPTIONS AND OTHER EQUITY INTERESTS

    When the merger occurs, each outstanding option to acquire shares of Dean's
common stock will automatically convert into a fully exercisable option to
purchase a number of shares of Suiza's common stock. The conversion rate for
Dean's options will depend on the price of Suiza's stock when the merger occurs.
Also, Dean common stock appreciation rights, phantom stock awards and
performance share awards granted under Dean plans will automatically convert
into fully vested stock appreciation rights, phantom stock awards and
performance share awards with respect to Suiza's common stock based on the same
conversion formula as the options. The formula for determining the precise
number of shares of Suiza common stock into which each outstanding Dean
stock-based award will be exercisable is:

    - the number of shares of Dean common stock to which the corresponding Dean
      option or other stock-based award was subject, multiplied by

    - the sum of (1) the exchange ratio for the number of shares of Suiza common
      stock issued in exchange for shares of Dean common stock in the merger
      (which will be 0.429, subject to adjustment as described under "--What
      Dean's Stockholders Will Receive" on page 39), plus

      (2) the per share cash amount paid in the merger (which will be $21.00,
      subject to adjustment as described under "--What Dean's Stockholders Will
      Receive" on page 39) divided by the closing price for a share of Suiza
      common stock as reported on the NYSE on the last trading day immediately
      preceding the merger closing date,

    - rounded to the nearest whole share of Suiza common stock.

    The per share exercise price for each share of Suiza common stock subject to
the new Suiza option or other stock-based award will equal:

    - the per share exercise price of the corresponding Dean option or other
      stock-based award, divided by

    - the sum of (1) the exchange ratio for the number of shares of Suiza common
      stock issued in exchange for shares of Dean common stock in the merger
      (which will be 0.429, subject to adjustment as described under "--What
      Dean's Stockholders Will Receive" on page 39), plus (2) the per share cash
      amount paid in the merger (which will be $21.00, subject to adjustment as
      described under "--What Dean's Stockholders Will Receive" on page 39)
      divided by the closing price for a share of Suiza common stock as reported
      on the NYSE on the last trading day immediately preceding the merger
      closing date.

    Had the merger closed on             , 2001, an option to purchase 100
shares of Dean's stock at $      per share would have been converted into an
option to purchase   shares of Suiza's stock at $      per share.

    All other terms of Dean's stock options and other stock-based awards will
remain unchanged after the conversion. Suiza has agreed to file a registration
statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission on an appropriate form to
the extent necessary to register shares of Suiza's common stock subject to the
converted options and other stock-based awards.

INTERIM OPERATIONS OF SUIZA AND DEAN

    We have agreed to restrictions on both of our companies until the effective
time of the merger. In general, we are each required to conduct our business in
all material respects in the usual and ordinary course, consistent with past
practice; to use our commercially reasonable efforts to preserve substantially
intact our present business organizations and material lines of business,
maintain our material rights, maintain our assets and preserve our relationships
with key employees, customers, suppliers and others having business dealings
with us; and to perform in all material respects our obligations under our
material contracts.

    In addition, except for specifically enumerated items, Dean is not permitted
to:

    - increase any compensation outside the ordinary course of business, grant
      any severance, establish any bonus plan or other employee benefit plan, or
      amend or take other actions that would be materially adverse to Dean
      regarding any of its material contracts, employee benefit plans or other
      agreements, programs or policies;

    - declare any dividends other than intercompany dividends in the ordinary
      course of business and normal quarterly dividends based on record dates of
      May 25, 2001, August 24, 2001 and November 23, 2001 if the merger has not
      occurred by these dates;

    - redeem or acquire any of its securities;

    - adopt a plan to liquidate, restructure or recapitalize Dean;

    - reclassify any Dean stock or issue any securities in substitution of any
      Dean stock;

    - issue any stock options or modify the terms of any options to make them
      materially less favorable to Dean;

    - acquire or agree to acquire any business except for any acquisitions that
      do not involve the aggregate payment of more than $10 million by Dean and
      that do not present a material risk of making it more difficult to obtain
      any consents or approvals, including antitrust consents, required to close
      the merger;

    - sell, pledge or otherwise dispose of any material assets other than sales
      of inventories and assets in the ordinary course of business and
      consistent with past practice;

    - release any third party from obligations under any confidentiality or
      standstill agreement;

    - amend its bylaws in a way that adversely impacts the closing of the merger
      or amend its charter in any way;

    - incur any obligation for borrowed money that would interfere with the
      merger or increase the cost to Suiza of closing the merger;

    - incur any capital expenditure outside the ordinary course of business;

    - make any loan or investment in any person other than a wholly-owned
      subsidiary;

    - enter into any material contract providing for an exclusive arrangement
      for a term of more than one year;

    - enter into any agreement that could restrict Suiza from competing in any
      line of business or in any geographic area;

    - enter into any specified types of material contract;

    - enter into or extend any exclusive agreement for milk supply unless it
      terminates or can be terminated before December 31, 2001 without penalty;

    - dispose of any part of its investment in White Wave, Inc. or amend any
      agreements relating to that investment; or

    - agree in writing to do any of these things.

    Prior to the merger, Suiza is not permitted to:

    - take any action that would result in its stock being de-listed by the
      NYSE;

    - declare any dividends other than inter-company dividends in the ordinary
      course of business consistent with past practice;

    - amend its charter or bylaws in a way that adversely impacts the closing of
      the merger;

    - repurchase any shares of Suiza common stock during the 10 trading day
      period ending two business days prior to the closing date;

    - close or agree to an acquisition unless it does not present a material
      risk of making it more difficult to obtain any consents or approvals,
      including antitrust consents, required to close the merger; or

    - agree in writing to do any of these things.

CERTAIN EMPLOYEE BENEFIT MATTERS

    The merger agreement provides that Suiza will, for a period of one year from
the date the merger occurs, provide compensation and employee benefits to
current and former Dean employees who are, at the time of the merger closing,
entitled to such compensation and benefits, which in the aggregate are
substantially comparable to the compensation and benefits that Dean currently
provides them. This agreement does not apply to employees covered by collective
bargaining agreements, for whom Suiza

must only comply with the terms of the collective bargaining agreements. Suiza
has also agreed to assume all deferred compensation, incentive compensation or
vacation and other paid time off plans, policies or arrangements maintained or
contributed to by Dean and any employment, consulting, retention, severance or
similar agreement to which Dean is a party with any of its employees, in
accordance with the terms in effect immediately prior to the merger. Suiza may
revise such plans, policies or arrangements for benefits accruing after the
merger occurs.

    The merger agreement also includes detailed covenants of both companies with
respect to various other employee benefits matters.

INDEMNIFICATION OF DEAN'S DIRECTORS AND OFFICERS

    The merger agreement provides that:

    - all rights to indemnification existing in favor of directors, officers or
      employees of Dean in the certificate of incorporation or bylaws of Dean on
      April 4, 2001 as they relate to matters occurring through the date of the
      merger will survive the merger and will continue in full force and effect
      after the merger; and

    - for six years after the date the merger occurs, Suiza will maintain
      officers' and directors' liability insurance covering matters or events
      occurring prior to the effective time of the merger. This insurance must
      be no less favorable than the policies in effect on April 4, 2001, except
      that Suiza is not required to pay more than twice the amount of annual
      premiums paid by Dean prior to the merger.

ADDITIONAL COVENANTS IN THE MERGER AGREEMENT

    We have agreed to other covenants in the merger agreement, including the
following:

    REASONABLE BEST EFFORTS COVENANT.  We have each agreed to use our reasonable
best efforts to take all actions and to do all things necessary, proper or
advisable under the merger agreement and applicable law to complete the merger.
Suiza agreed to use its reasonable best efforts to close the financing
contemplated by its commitment letter, including the execution of the loan
documents contemplated by the financing commitments on or before July 31, 2001,
and to use the funds from the financing to complete the merger.

    AGREEMENT TO SEEK REGULATORY APPROVAL.  We have each agreed to promptly make
all filings under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act regarding the merger, which we have,
and to promptly make any other required submissions under that act. We have each
additionally agreed to use our reasonable best efforts to cooperate with one
another to (1) determine which filings and notifications are required to be made
under applicable law, and which consents are required to be obtained from
governmental entities in order to close the merger; (2) timely make all these
filings and notifications and timely seek all these consents and (3) promptly
respond to any request for information from any governmental entities.

    We have each agreed to use our reasonable best efforts to have lifted or
terminated any order or judgment that would restrain or prevent the closing of
the merger by December 31, 2001. We have also agreed to use our reasonable best
efforts to take any steps necessary to avoid or eliminate all impediments under
any antitrust law asserted by a governmental entity so that the merger may close
as soon as possible and by December 31, 2001 at the latest.

    Additionally, we have agreed to divest or hold separate any of our
respective businesses, product lines or assets, so long as the action is
conditioned upon the merger closing and would not, in Suiza's opinion, have a
material adverse effect on the combined company. Suiza specifically agreed to
divest six specific milk processing plants and assets used to operate such
plants if necessary in order to obtain consent under applicable antitrust laws.
Dean agreed not to take any actions, such as divesting any assets or businesses,
that would limit the combined company's freedom of action regarding its
business, without Suiza's prior written consent.

    ADDITIONAL MUTUAL COVENANTS.  The merger agreement also contains mutual
covenants relating to the holding of our stockholder meetings, access to
information and employees of the other party, and public announcements with
respect to the merger.

MATERIAL FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSEQUENCES OF THE MERGER

    The following discussion summarizes the anticipated material U.S. federal
income tax consequences of the merger to you if you are a Dean stockholder. This
discussion addresses only those stockholders who hold their shares of Dean
common stock as a capital asset. This discussion does not describe all of the
U.S. federal income tax consequences that may be relevant to particular Dean
stockholders in light of their individual circumstances. It also does not
describe all of the U.S. federal income tax consequences if you are subject to
special rules, such as:

    - a financial institution;

    - a mutual fund;

    - a tax-exempt organization;

    - an insurance company;

    - a dealer in securities or foreign currencies;

    - a trader in securities who elects to apply a mark-to-market method of
      accounting;

    - a foreign holder;

    - a person who holds shares of Dean common stock as a hedge against currency
      risk or as part of a straddle, constructive sale or conversion
      transaction; or

    - a person who acquired shares of Dean common stock upon the exercise of
      warrants or employee stock options or otherwise as compensation.

    The following discussion is not binding on the Internal Revenue Service. It
is based upon the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and the related
regulations, rulings and decisions in effect as of the date of this joint proxy
statement/prospectus. All of these rules are subject to change, possibly with
retroactive effect. Tax consequences under state, local and foreign laws and
U.S. federal laws other than U.S. federal income tax laws, are not addressed.

    The merger has been structured so as to qualify as a tax-fee reorganization
under Section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code. Assuming the merger qualifies
as a tax-free reorganization, you will not be required to recognize a taxable
gain on the Suiza common stock you receive in the merger. However, depending on
how much you paid for your shares of Dean common stock, you may have taxable
gain as a result of the cash you receive in the merger. The amount of that gain
will be equal to the lesser of (1) the amount of cash you receive in the merger
and (2) an amount equal to (a) the fair market value of the Suiza common stock
and cash that you receive in the merger minus (b) your tax basis (which is
generally equal to your cost) for the shares of Dean common stock that you are
exchanging in the merger. If you own two or more blocks of Dean common stock
acquired on different days and/or for different prices, this computation must be
made separately for each such block. Any such gain will generally be a long-term
capital gain if you held the shares of Dean common stock exchanged for more than
one year. However, if the receipt of cash has the effect of a distribution of a
dividend (determined by application of Section 302 of the Internal Revenue Code
on a stockholder-by-stockholder basis), this gain will be treated as a dividend,
and taxed as ordinary income, to the extent of your share of the undistributed
accumulated earnings and profits of Dean. The likelihood of dividend treatment
may depend on the value of the Suiza stock received in the merger compared to
the amount of cash received in the merger. The likelihood of dividend treatment
may also depend on whether you, or persons whose stock ownership is attributed
to you, also hold Suiza common stock prior to the merger, and may depend on
other factors. YOU SHOULD CONSULT YOUR TAX ADVISOR CONCERNING THE POSSIBILITY
THAT ALL OR A PORTION OF THE CASH YOU RECEIVE IN EXCHANGE FOR YOUR DEAN COMMON
STOCK WILL BE TREATED AS A DIVIDEND.

    Your aggregate tax basis in the Suiza common stock you receive in the merger
will equal (1) your aggregate tax basis in the shares of Dean common stock you
are exchanging minus (2) the amount of any cash consideration you receive, plus
(3) the amount of gain, if any, you recognize in the merger (including any
portion of such gain that is treated as a dividend). The holding period of the
Suiza common stock you receive generally will include the holding period of the
shares of Dean common stock you exchanged.

    No fractional shares of Suiza common stock will be issued in the merger. If
you receive cash in lieu of a fractional share, you will be treated as having
received such fractional share in the merger and then having exchanged such
fractional share for cash in a redemption by Suiza. You will generally recognize
gain or loss on such a deemed redemption of the fractional share in an amount
equal to the cash received minus your tax basis allocable to the fractional
share. Any capital gain or loss will be long-term capital gain or loss if you
held the common stock exchanged for more than one year.

    If you exercise your appraisal rights and receive a payment in cash for your
Dean common stock, you will recognize capital gain or loss if you held the Dean
common stock as a capital asset at the time the merger occurs. This gain or loss
will be equal to (1) the amount of cash you receive minus (2) your aggregate tax
basis for the shares of Dean common stock so sold, provided that the cash
payment you receive is not treated as a dividend under Section 302 of the
Internal Revenue Code. A sale of Dean common stock pursuant to an exercise of
appraisal rights will not constitute a dividend if you own no stock in Suiza
after the merger, either actually or constructively within the meaning of
Section 318 of the Internal Revenue Code. See "--Appraisal Rights" on page 55.

    Because Suiza's stockholders will not receive any cash or stock in the
merger, the merger will not cause Suiza's stockholders to recognize any gain or
loss.

    This discussion is intended to provide only a general summary of the
material federal income tax consequences of the merger. This discussion is not a
complete analysis or description of all potential federal income tax
consequences of the merger. This discussion does not address tax consequences
that may vary with, or are contingent on, individual circumstances. In addition,
it does not address any non-income tax or any foreign, state or local tax
consequences of the merger. ACCORDINGLY, IF YOU ARE A DEAN STOCKHOLDER, SUIZA
AND DEAN STRONGLY URGE YOU TO CONSULT YOUR OWN TAX ADVISOR TO DETERMINE THE
PARTICULAR UNITED STATES FEDERAL, STATE OR LOCAL OR FOREIGN INCOME OR OTHER TAX
CONSEQUENCES TO YOU OF THE MERGER.

AMENDMENT OF THE MERGER AGREEMENT

    We may amend the merger agreement at any time before or after approval by
our respective stockholders. However, after the stockholders have approved the
proposals, we cannot make an amendment to the merger agreement which requires
further approval by stockholders without such approval.

    At any time before the merger occurs, we may, without stockholder approval:

    - extend the time in which any obligations of the other parties must be
      performed;

    - waive any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties; and

    - waive compliance with any of the agreements or conditions in the merger
      agreement.

ACCOUNTING TREATMENT

    The merger will be accounted for using the purchase method of accounting.
Under this accounting method, Suiza will record Dean's assets and liabilities at
their fair values, and, if the purchase price exceeds the total of these fair
values, Suiza will record the excess as goodwill. Suiza will include Dean's
revenues and expenses in its financial statements beginning on the date the
merger occurs.

APPRAISAL RIGHTS

    If a corporation proposes to merge with another firm, stockholders are
sometimes entitled to appraisal (or dissenters') rights when the transaction
closes, depending on the circumstances. Appraisal rights give a stockholder the
right to receive the fair value for its shares as determined in a judicial
appraisal proceeding, instead of what is being paid in the merger.

    If you are a Dean stockholder, you do have appraisal rights under Delaware
law in connection with the merger. If you are a Suiza stockholder, you are not
entitled to appraisal rights under Delaware law in connection with the merger.

    If you are a Dean stockholder and you do not wish to accept the
consideration to be paid under the merger agreement, you may elect to have the
fair value of your Dean common stock, exclusive of any element of value arising
from the accomplishment or expectation of the merger, judicially determined and
paid in cash, together with a fair rate of interest, if any, provided that you
comply strictly with the provisions and requirements of Section 262 of the
Delaware General Corporation Law.

    The following discussion is not a complete statement of the law pertaining
to appraisal rights under Delaware law, and is qualified in its entirety by the
full text of Section 262, which is attached as Annex E to this joint proxy
statement/prospectus. Each reference in Section 262 and in this summary to a
"stockholder" means a record holder of the shares of Dean common stock who has
asserted appraisal rights.

    Under Section 262, where a proposed merger is to be submitted for approval
at a meeting of stockholders, a corporation must notify each of its stockholders
of record who were such as of the record date for the meeting and for whom
appraisal rights are available, not less than 20 days prior to the meeting, that
appraisal rights are available, and must include in the notice a copy of
Section 262. If you are a Dean stockholder, this joint proxy
statement/prospectus constitutes notice to you of your appraisal rights. If you
are a Dean stockholder and want to exercise appraisal rights or preserve the
right to do so you should review carefully Annex E to this joint proxy
statement/prospectus. If you fail to comply strictly with the procedures
specified in Section 262 on a timely and proper basis you will lose your
appraisal rights. The procedures for exercising your right to appraisal is
complex, so we strongly encourage Dean's stockholders who consider exercising
such rights to seek the advice of counsel.

    If you are a Dean stockholder and you wish to exercise your right to
appraisal under Section 262 of the DGCL, you must satisfy each of the conditions
listed below.

    - You must deliver to Dean a written demand for appraisal of your Dean
      shares before the vote on the merger agreement at the Dean stockholder
      meeting. This written demand for appraisal is in addition to and separate
      from any proxy or vote against the merger agreement. Merely voting
      against, abstaining from voting or failing to vote in favor of adoption of
      the merger agreement will not constitute a demand for appraisal within the
      meaning of Section 262.

    - You must not vote for adoption of the merger agreement. A failure to vote
      will satisfy this requirement, but a vote in favor of the merger agreement
      will constitute a waiver of your right of appraisal. Accordingly, if you
      want to maintain appraisal rights you must either check the "Against" box
      or the "Abstain" box on the proxy card or refrain from executing and
      returning the enclosed proxy card.

    - You must continuously hold the shares from the date of making the demand
      through the effective time of the merger. Accordingly, if you are a record
      holder of Dean stock when you make the written demand for appraisal but
      then transfer the Dean shares prior to the effective time of the merger
      you will lose your right to appraisal.

    If you make a demand for appraisal, you or someone on your behalf must give
notice in your name as it appears on your Dean stock certificates, specifying
your mailing address, the number of shares you own and your intention to demand
appraisal. If your Dean shares are owned of record in a fiduciary capacity, for
example by a trustee, guardian or custodian, the demand should be made in that
capacity, and if the shares are owned of record by more than one person, for
example in a joint tenancy or tenancy in common, the demand should be executed
by or on behalf of all owners. An authorized agent, including one or more joint
owners, may make a demand for appraisal on your behalf. However, the agent must
identify you as the record owner or owners and expressly disclose the fact that,
in making the demand, the agent is acting as agent for the owner or owners.

    A record holder, such as a broker who holds shares as nominee for several
beneficial owners, may exercise appraisal rights with respect to the Dean shares
held for one or more beneficial owners while not exercising the rights with
respect to the Dean shares held for one or more other beneficial owners. The
written demand should set forth the number of shares as to which appraisal is
sought, and where no number of shares is expressly mentioned the demand will be
presumed to cover all shares held in the name of the record owner. If you are a
Dean stockholder who holds shares in brokerage accounts or other nominee forms
and you wish to exercise appraisal rights, we urge you to consult with your
broker to determine the appropriate procedures for the nominee to make a demand
for appraisal.

    If you elect to exercise appraisal rights, you must mail or deliver a
written demand to: Dean Foods Company, 3600 North River Road, Franklin Park,
Illinois 60131, Attention: Corporate Secretary.

    Within ten days after the effective time of the merger, Blackhawk, as the
surviving corporation of the merger, must give written notice that the merger
has become effective to each Dean stockholder who has complied with
Section 262. Within 120 days after the effective time, but not thereafter,
either Blackhawk or any stockholder who has complied with the requirements of
Section 262 may file a petition in the Delaware Court of Chancery seeking a
determination of the value of the shares of Dean common stock held by all
dissenting stockholders. Blackhawk does not presently intend to file a petition,
and if you seek to exercise appraisal rights you should not assume that
Blackhawk will file a petition or that Blackhawk will initiate any negotiations
with respect to the fair value of your shares. If you are a Dean stockholder and
want to have your Dean shares appraised you should be prepared to initiate any
petitions necessary for the perfection of your appraisal rights within the time
periods and in the manner prescribed in Section 262. Since Blackhawk has no
obligation to file a petition, your failure to file a petition within the period
specified could result in a loss of your appraisal rights. In any event, at any
time within 60 days after the effective time, or at any time thereafter with the
written consent of Blackhawk, if you demand appraisal you will have the right to
withdraw your demand and to accept payment of the consideration provided in the
merger agreement.

    If you comply with the provisions of Section 262 within 20 days after the
effective time of the merger, you may request in writing and receive from
Blackhawk a statement setting forth the aggregate number of shares not voted in
favor of the merger agreement and with respect to which demands for appraisal
have been received and the aggregate number of holders of such shares. Blackhawk
must mail this statement to you within 10 days of receipt of your request.

    If you timely file a petition for an appraisal, the Delaware Chancery Court
will hold a hearing on your petition. The court will determine whether you are
entitled to appraisal rights and will appraise the "fair value" of your shares,
exclusive of any element of value arising from the accomplishment or expectation
of the merger, together with a fair rate of interest, if any, to be paid upon
the amount determined to be the fair value. The costs of the action may be
determined by the Delaware Chancery Court and taxed upon the parties as the
Delaware Chancery Court deems equitable. Upon application of a petitioning
former Dean stockholder, the Delaware Chancery Court may also order that all or
a portion of the expenses incurred by any former Dean stockholder in connection
with the appraisal proceeding, including reasonable attorneys' fees and the fees
and expenses of experts, be charged pro

rata against the value of all of the shares entitled to appraisal. IF YOU ARE
CONSIDERING SEEKING APPRAISAL YOU SHOULD BE AWARE THAT THE FAIR VALUE OF YOUR
DEAN SHARES AS DETERMINED UNDER SECTION 262 COULD BE MORE THAN, THE SAME AS, OR
LESS THAN THE CONSIDERATION THAT YOU WOULD RECEIVE PURSUANT TO THE MERGER
AGREEMENT IF YOU DID NOT SEEK APPRAISAL OF YOUR DEAN SHARES, AND THAT THE
OPINION RENDERED BY GOLDMAN SACHS & CO. IS NOT AN OPINION AS TO FAIR VALUE UNDER
SECTION 262.

    In determining fair value, the Delaware Chancery Court is to take into
account all relevant factors. In the case of WEINBERGER V. UOP, INC., the
Delaware Supreme Court discussed the factors that could be considered in
determining fair value in an appraisal proceeding, stating that "proof of value
by any techniques or methods which are generally considered acceptable in the
financial community and otherwise admissible in court" should be considered, and
that "fair price obviously requires consideration of all relevant factors
involving the value of a company." The Delaware Supreme Court stated that, in
making this determination of fair value, the court must consider market value,
asset value, dividends, earnings prospects, the nature of the enterprise and any
other facts which could be ascertained as of the date of the merger that throw
any light on future prospects of the merged corporation. In the Weinberger case,
the Delaware Supreme Court stated that "elements of future value, including the
nature of the enterprise, which are known or susceptible of proof as of the date
of the merger and not the product of speculation, may be considered."
Section 262 provides that fair value is to be "exclusive of any element of value
arising from the accomplishment or expectation of the merger." In CEDE & CO. V.
TECHNICOLOR, INC., the Delaware Supreme Court stated that such exclusion is a
"narrow exclusion [that] does not encompass known elements of value."

    If you properly demand an appraisal in compliance with Section 262 you will
not, after the effective time of the merger, be entitled to vote the shares that
are the subject of the demand for any purpose nor will you be entitled to the
payment of dividends or other distributions on those shares (except dividends or
other distributions payable to holders of record of shares as of a record date
prior to the effective time of the merger).

    At any time before the 60th day after the effective time of the merger you
will have the right to withdraw your demand for appraisal and to accept the
terms offered in the merger. After this period, you may withdraw the demand for
appraisal only with the consent of Blackhawk. If no petition for appraisal is
filed with the Delaware Chancery Court within 120 days after the effective time
of the merger, or if you withdraw the demand for appraisal as discussed in the
preceding sentences, your rights to appraisal will cease, and you will be
entitled to receive the merger consideration. You may withdraw your demand for
appraisal by delivering to Blackhawk a written withdrawal of your demand for
appraisal and acceptance of the merger at the following address: 2515 McKinney
Avenue, Suite 1200, Dallas, Texas 75201, Attention: Corporate Secretary. No
appraisal proceeding in the Delaware Chancery Court may be dismissed as to any
stockholder without the approval of the Delaware Chancery Court, and the
approval may be conditioned upon terms the Delaware Chancery Court deems fair.
If Blackhawk does not approve your request to withdraw a demand for appraisal
when the approval is required and the Delaware Chancery Court does not approve
the dismissal of an appraisal proceeding, you will be entitled to receive only
the appraised value determined in the appraisal proceeding. This value could be
lower than the value of the merger consideration.

    If you fail to comply strictly with the procedures set forth in Section 262
you will lose your statutory appraisal rights.

THE RELATED TRANSACTIONS

    In connection with the merger, Suiza has entered into an agreement with
Dairy Farmers of America (DFA) to purchase DFA's 33.8% interest in Suiza Dairy
Group in exchange for:

    - approximately $165 million in cash, subject to adjustment as described
      below;

    - a subordinated contingent promissory note in the original principal amount
      of $50 million payable only in the event that Suiza terminates or breaches
      one of its existing milk supply agreements with DFA prior to the twentieth
      anniversary of the merger date; and

    - six plants (and the operations associated with those plants) located in
      areas where Suiza's and Dean's operations overlap.

    Also as part of the consideration to be paid to DFA, Suiza intends to amend
one of Suiza's current milk supply agreements with DFA to provide that if Suiza
does not, within a specified period after closing, offer DFA the right to supply
raw milk, or manage the supply of raw milk, to certain of Dean's dairy plants
after the merger, Suiza could be required to pay up to $80 million of liquidated
damages to DFA. Any such liquidated damages would be paid, without interest,
over a five-year period and would reduce the principal amount of the
$50 million contingent promissory note described above by an amount equal to
approximately 25% of such payments.

    The cash portion of the purchase price is subject to adjustment based on
(1) DFA and its affiliate's pro rata share of the earnings of Suiza Dairy Group
and the amount of distributions made by Suiza Dairy Group to DFA and one of its
affiliates before the closing and (2) the level of current assets and current
liabilities associated with the six processing plants to be transferred as part
of the purchase price. In addition, the parties will increase or decrease the
cash portion of the purchase price based on the amount of earnings (before
interest expense, taxes and depreciation and amortization) that the six
processing plants are reasonably expected to generate. Instead of an adjustment
to the cash portion of the purchase price based on such earnings, Suiza and DFA
may agree to the transfer of additional dairy operations to DFA, or some
combination of cash and additional dairy operations. Suiza intends to pay the
cash portion of the purchase price using proceeds from a loan under its new
credit facility. See "Risk Factors--Risks Relating to the Merger--Suiza may not
be able to obtain the financing needed for the merger on favorable terms" on
page 23 and "Where You Can Find More Information" on page 98.

    The promissory note will have a term of twenty years and will bear interest
based on the consumer price index. Interest will not be paid in cash. Instead,
interest will be added to the principal amount of the note annually, up to a
maximum principal amount of $120 million. Suiza may prepay the note in whole or
in part at any time, without penalty. DFA may require Suiza to pay the note in
full if Suiza materially breaches or terminates one of its milk supply
agreements with DFA without renewal or replacement with another milk supply
agreement with DFA. Suiza may terminate the note in the event DFA materially
breaches or terminates one of its milk supply agreements without renewal or
replacement with another milk supply agreement with Suiza, or if DFA becomes
insolvent, enters bankruptcy, liquidates or dissolves. The note will expire at
the end of twenty years, without any obligation by Suiza to pay any portion of
the principal or interest.

    The six dairy plants to be transferred are located where Suiza and Dean have
overlapping operations. The plants are Dean's Barber Dairies fluid milk plant in
Birmingham, Alabama; Suiza's Velda Farms plant in Miami, Florida; Suiza's Velda
Farms plant in Winter Haven, Florida; Dean's H. Meyer Dairy Company plant in
Cincinnati, Ohio; Dean's Coburg Dairy, Inc. plant in North Charleston, South
Carolina; and Dean's Cream O Weber Dairy, Inc. plant in Salt Lake City, Utah.
See "--Additional Covenants in the Merger Agreement" on page 52 for a discussion
of covenants and agreements in the merger agreement that are related to the
transfer of these properties, and "Risk Factors--Risks Relating to the
Merger--The merger could be delayed if the related transactions fail to close"
on page 23.

    DFA has assigned its right to acquire the six plants to National Dairy
Holdings, LP, in which DFA owns a minority interest. Therefore, when the merger
occurs, Suiza expects to transfer the six plants to National Dairy rather than
to DFA.

    Suiza's proposed acquisition of DFA's minority interest in Suiza Dairy Group
is contingent on, and is expected to occur simultaneously with, the completion
of the merger. However, completion of the transaction with DFA is not a
condition to completion of the merger.

    This discussion of the related transactions assumes the terms of certain
amendments to Suiza's agreements with DFA that the parties expect to sign prior
to the time of the merger.

    On April 4, 2001, the last full trading day prior to the public announcement
of the merger, the closing price for Suiza's common stock was $46.44. The
closing price for Dean's common stock was $32.50 on that same day. On
            , 2001, the closing price was $      for Suiza's common stock and
$            for Dean's common stock. WE URGE YOU TO OBTAIN CURRENT MARKET
QUOTATIONS FOR SUIZA'S COMMON STOCK AND DEAN'S COMMON STOCK BEFORE MAKING ANY
DECISION ON THE MERGER.

    When the merger occurs, Suiza will change its name to "Dean Foods Company."
In connection with the name change, Suiza's trading symbol on the NYSE will
change from "SZA" to "DF".

    The merger agreement permits Dean to declare its regular quarterly cash
dividends to stockholders, based on record dates of May 25, 2001, August 24,
2001 and November 23, 2001, if the merger has not occurred by those dates. Dean
declared a dividend of $0.225 per share to stockholders of record on May 25,
2001, which was paid on June 15, 2001. If Dean declares a dividend on one of
these dividend record dates and the closing of the merger occurs prior to the
payment of the dividends, Suiza will pay these dividends on the scheduled
payment date to Dean's stockholders of record as of the particular dividend
record date. Suiza has not paid dividends on its common stock in the past and
does not expect to in the foreseeable future.

        UNAUDITED PRO FORMA CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL INFORMATION

    The pro forma financial information of Suiza shown under this heading for
the year ended December 31, 2000 and the three months ended March 31, 2001 is
derived from the historical financial statements of Suiza and Dean and gives
effect to the merger and the related transactions. The Dean historical financial
information included in the pro forma financial information for the year ended
December 31, 2000 is derived from Dean's results of operations for the twelve
months ended November 26, 2000. The Dean historical financial information
included in the pro forma financial information for the three months ended
March 31, 2001 is derived from Dean's results of operations for the three months
ended February 25, 2001. Dean's actual fiscal year ends on the last Sunday of
May. The pro forma balance sheet data shown under this heading is presented as
if the merger and the related transactions had occurred on March 31, 2001 and
the pro forma income statement data shown under this heading assumes the merger
and the related transactions occurred on January 1, 2000.

    The merger will be treated as a purchase business combination for accounting
purposes, and the Dean assets acquired and liabilities assumed will be recorded
at their fair value. The actual purchase price for the acquisition of Dean
cannot be determined yet since the acquisition has not yet been completed.
Holders of Dean common stock will receive a combination of cash and Suiza common
stock for each share of Dean common stock they own as of the closing of the
merger. For the purpose of the following pro forma financial information, we
have assumed that Suiza's common stock price is $47.83 (based on an average of
closing prices for Suiza's common stock from April 2, 2001 through April 10,
2001) and that 35.6 million shares of Dean common stock are outstanding at the
date of the merger. The allocations of the purchase price to Dean's assets,
intangible assets and liabilities are only preliminary allocations based on
estimates of fair values and will change when actual fair values are determined.

    The pro forma statements of income shown under this heading do not include
cost savings from synergies which may be achievable subsequent to the closing of
the merger or the impact of non-recurring items directly related to the merger.

    The pro forma financial information shown under this heading is unaudited,
is presented for informational purposes only, is not necessarily indicative of
the financial position or results of operations that would actually have
occurred had the merger or the related transactions been consummated as of the
dates or at the beginning of the periods presented, nor is it necessarily
indicative of future operating results or financial position. The pro forma
financial information shown under this heading and the accompanying notes should
be read together with the historical financial statements and related notes
contained in the annual reports and other information that we have filed with
the Securities and Exchange Commission and incorporated by reference in this
joint proxy statement/prospectus. See "Where You Can Find More Information" on
page 98.

NOTES TO UNAUDITED PRO FORMA CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME
(in thousands except share data)

[a] The Emerging Issues Task Force of the Financial Accounting Standards Board
    Issue No. 00-10 "Accounting for Shipping and Handling Fees and Costs" became
    effective for Dean in the fourth quarter of its fiscal year ended May 27,
    2001. This resulted in a reclassification to Dean's income statement for its
    fiscal year ended May 27, 2001; however this reclassification has not been
    reflected in the historical Dean amounts in these pro forma financial
    statements. If this reclassification were recorded in these pro forma
    statements, it would have had the effect of increasing the following line
    items on the income statement for the periods presented. There is no net
    impact to Dean's operations as a result of this reclassification.

                                                                  THREE MONTHS
                                                YEAR ENDED            ENDED
                                             DECEMBER 31, 2000   MARCH 31, 2001
                                             -----------------   ---------------

Net sales..................................       $38,249            $10,589
Cost of sales..............................         2,994                820
Selling and distribution...................        35,255              9,769

[b] On December 1, 2000, Dean sold a $30 million subordinated note which was
    received as part of the proceeds from the sale of Dean's vegetable segment
    in Dean's 1999 fiscal year, for cash proceeds of $10 million. Due to the
    uncertainty of the collectibility of the note, the note was originally
    valued at a nominal amount. As a result of the sale, Dean reversed
    $10 million of the original reserve against the note, resulting in a
    $10 million pre-tax gain in its second quarter of fiscal 2001.

[c] Pro forma adjustment to eliminate Dean's historical amortization of
    goodwill, net of the amounts related to Dean's divested operations.

    On June 29, 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued a new
    business combinations financial accounting standard and a new intangible
    asset financial accounting standard. The new business combinations financial
    accounting standard and the portion of the new intangible asset financial
    accounting standard related to the elimination of the requirement to
    amortize goodwill and intangibles with indefinite lives, are effective for
    acquisistions completed after June 30, 2001 and therefore no amortization
    for goodwill or intangibles with indefinite lives has been included for the
    purchase of Dean. The remaining provisions of the new intangible asset
    financial accounting standard which will discontinue the requirement to
    amortize existing goodwill and existing intangibles with indefinite lives
    for business combinations completed prior to June 30, 2001 are not effective
    for Suiza until January 1, 2002. Since these remaining provisions are not
    yet effective, Suiza will continue to amortize historical goodwill and
    intangibles with indefinite lives until January 1, 2002 when such
    amortization will cease. No pro forma adjustment has been included for the
    elimination of historical Suiza amortization of goodwill and intangibles
    with indefinite lives.

    Suiza has not completed an assessment of the fair value of assets and
    liabilities of Dean and the related business integration plans. Suiza
    expects that the ultimate purchase price allocation will include adjustments
    to the fair values of depreciable tangible assets, allocations of a portion
    of the purchase price to identifiable intangible assets (some of which will
    have indefinite lives) and adjustments to the carrying value of certain
    liabilities. Accordingly, to the extent that such assessments indicate that
    the fair value of the assets and liabilities differ from their net book
    values, such difference would adjust the amounts allocated to those assets
    and liabilities and would change the amounts allocated to goodwill. Assuming
    a weighted average useful life of depreciable assets of 15 years, every
    $5 million of excess purchase price which is reallocated between depreciable
    assets and goodwill will result in a change in depreciation expense for the
    year ended December 31, 2000 of approximately $0.3 million.

[d] Pro forma adjustment to reflect interest expense on the new credit facility
    borrowings and estimated additional borrowings under the receivable-backed
    loan, partially offset by the elimination of interest expense related to the
    debt repaid, as follows:

                                                          YEAR ENDED
                                                         DECEMBER 31,    THREE MONTHS ENDED
                                                             2000          MARCH 31, 2001
                                                         -------------   ------------------

Interest on proceeds under new credit facility assuming
  a weighted average interest rate of 9.13% for the
  year and 8.97% for the three month period............    $171,588           $ 42,143
Interest on estimated additional borrowings under
  receivable-backed loan assuming a weighted average
  interest rate of 6.92% for the year and 6.38% for the
  three month period...................................      15,595              3,594
Letter of credit and commitment fees...................       3,774                919
Amortization of fair value adjustment on Dean's debt...       6,835              1,670
Amortization of deferred financing costs...............       7,293              1,823
Less historical interest expense on the following debt
  repaid:
  Suiza's credit facility, including letter of credit
    and commitment fees................................     (98,266)           (23,050)
  Amortization of deferred financing costs.............      (2,257)              (566)
  Dean's commercial paper..............................     (18,896)            (4,529)
                                                           --------           --------
Pro forma adjustment to interest expense on debt
  facilities...........................................    $ 85,666           $ 22,004
                                                           ========           ========

    A 0.125% increase in the interest rate on the new credit facility and the
    estimated additional borrowings under the receivable-backed loan would
    increase interest expense by $2.8 million and $0.7 million for the year
    ended December 31, 2000 and the three months ended March 31, 2001,
    respectively.

[e] Pro forma adjustment to reflect income taxes at an estimated overall
    effective rate of 38.1%.

[f]  Pro forma adjustment to reclassify the operations of the six milk
    processing plants to be divested to a single line item, "Income on divested
    operations."

[g] Pro forma adjustment to reflect Suiza's acquisition of DFA's minority
    interest in Suiza Dairy Group and the elimination of the minority interest
    charge related to DFA's minority interest. In addition, management fees
    payable to DFA of $1 million and $0.25 million for the year ended
    December 31, 2000 and the three months ended March 31, 2001, respectively,
    have been eliminated.

[h] Pro forma adjustment to reflect interest expense on $172.3 million in
    borrowings under the new credit facility to fund the purchase, assuming a
    weighted average interest rate of 9.13% and 8.97% for the year ended
    December 31, 2000 and the three months ended March 31, 2001, respectively.
    These borrowings will be used to pay the cash portion of consideration (as
    adjusted for DFA's share of undistributed earnings after January 1, 2001) to
    purchase DFA's minority interest in Suiza Dairy Group.

[i]  Pro forma shares reflect historical Suiza basic shares adjusted for the
    issuance of shares to Dean stockholders in connection with the merger.

[j]  Pro forma shares reflect historical Suiza diluted shares adjusted for the
    issuance of shares to Dean stockholders in connection with the merger, and
    the dilutive impact of Dean stock options being converted to Suiza options
    in connection with the merger.

    These pro forma statements of income do not include adjustments to reflect
    cost savings from synergies which may be achieveable subsequent to the
    closing of the merger or the impact of non-recurring items directly related
    to the merger. In connection with the refinancing of existing credit
    facilities, Suiza will record an extraordinary loss of $5.3 million, net of
    income taxes of $3.2 million, related to the write-off of unamortized
    deferred financing costs of the old credit facility. Suiza will also
    recognize an estimated gain of $22.1 million, net of income taxes of
    $14.0 million, on the sale of existing Suiza plants to DFA in connection
    with the purchase of DFA's minority interest in Suiza Dairy Group.

NOTES TO UNAUDITED PRO FORMA CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET
(in thousands except share data)

(a) In connection with the merger, Suiza will pay each Dean stockholder $21.00
    in cash per share and issue 0.429 shares of Suiza common stock for each
    share of Dean common stock held (35.6 million shares in total as of
    March 31, 2001). If Suiza's stock price is below $32.71 at the time of the
    merger, the mix of stock and cash to be delivered to each Dean stockholder
    will be adjusted. In addition, based on Suiza's stock price as of March 31,
    2001, Suiza will issue approximately 0.866 Suiza stock options for each
    outstanding stock option of Dean.

    The following summarizes the total assumed purchase price and related
    preliminary allocation to the net assets acquired:

Total purchase price:
  Fair value of common stock issued based on an average
    Suiza share price of $47.83.............................  $  730,320

  Deferred tax effect of fair value adjustments.............       6,348
                                                              ----------

                                                              ==========

    Suiza has not completed an assessment of the fair value of assets and
    liabilities of Dean and the related business integration plans. Suiza
    expects that the ultimate purchase price allocation will include adjustments
    to the fair values of depreciable tangible assets, allocations of a portion
    of the purchase price to identifiable intangible assets (some of which will
    have indefinite lives) and adjustments to the carrying value of certain
    liabilities, including the establishment of any potential liabilities
    associated with business integration plans and termination and change in
    control benefits. Accordingly, to the extent that such assessments indicate
    that the fair value of the assets and liabilities differ from their net book
    values, such differences would be allocated to those assets and liabilities
    and would change the amounts allocated to goodwill.

(b) In connection with the refinancing of existing credit facilities discussed
    in (c) below, Suiza will record an extraordinary loss of $5.3 million, net
    of income taxes of $3.2 million, related to the write-off of unamortized
    deferred financing costs of the old credit facility.

(c) In connection with the merger, Suiza will enter into a new credit facility,
    will expand its receivable-backed loan facility, and will refinance certain
    indebtedness.

    The following table summarizes the sources and uses of the borrowings under
    the new credit facility and the increase in the receivable-backed loan:

    The $46 million of estimated financing costs are included in "Intangible and
    other assets" in the pro forma balance sheet.

(d) Represents the reclassification to a single line item, "Carrying value of
    assets to be divested," of the historical carrying values of the net assets
    of six divested milk processing plants as part of the purchase price for
    DFA's minority interest in Suiza Dairy Group.

(e) Reflects the acquisition of DFA's minority interest in Suiza Dairy Group for
    estimated consideration of approximately $412.3 million consisting of
    (i) $172.3 million in cash (as adjusted for DFA's share of undistributed
    earnings after January 1, 2001) and (ii) the net assets of six milk
    processing plants at fair value. The estimated consideration does not
    include any amounts related to agreements with DFA related to the
    subordinated contingent promissory note or the contingent liability for
    liquidated damages under an amendment to one of Suiza's milk supply
    agreements. As a result of the acquisition of DFA's minority interest in
    Suiza Dairy Group and the related sale of Suiza plants, Suiza will recognize
    an estimated gain of $22.1 million, net of income taxes of $14.0 million. In
    addition, Suiza will also recognize an additional reduction in equity of
    $6.2 million to fully recognize an accumulated other comprehensive loss on
    interest rate swaps that had previously been partially allocated to DFA's
    minority interest in Suiza Dairy Group.

                         OPINIONS OF FINANCIAL ADVISORS

OPINION OF DEAN'S FINANCIAL ADVISOR

OPINION OF GOLDMAN, SACHS & CO.

    On April 4, 2001, Goldman Sachs delivered its oral opinion, which it
subsequently confirmed in a written opinion dated April 4, 2001, to Dean's board
of directors that, as of April 4, 2001, the per share merger consideration to be
received by Dean's stockholders was fair from a financial point of view to
Dean's stockholders.

    THE FULL TEXT OF THE WRITTEN OPINION OF GOLDMAN SACHS, DATED APRIL 4, 2001,
ATTACHED AS ANNEX B TO THIS JOINT PROXY STATEMENT/PROSPECTUS, INCLUDES GOLDMAN
SACHS' ASSUMPTIONS, MATTERS CONSIDERED AND LIMITATIONS ON THE REVIEW UNDERTAKEN
IN CONNECTION WITH THE OPINION. GOLDMAN SACHS PROVIDED ITS ADVISORY SERVICES AND
ITS OPINION FOR THE INFORMATION AND ASSISTANCE OF DEAN'S BOARD OF DIRECTORS IN
CONNECTION WITH ITS CONSIDERATION OF THE MERGER. IT IS NOT A RECOMMENDATION AS
TO HOW ANY DEAN STOCKHOLDERS SHOULD VOTE AT DEAN'S STOCKHOLDER MEETING OR WITH
RESPECT TO THE MERGER. IF YOU ARE A DEAN STOCKHOLDER, YOU SHOULD READ THE
OPINION IN ANNEX B.

    In connection with its opinion, Goldman Sachs reviewed, among other things:

    - the merger agreement;

    - Dean's annual reports to stockholders and annual reports on Form 10-K for
      the five fiscal years ended May 28, 2000 and Suiza's annual reports to
      stockholders and annual reports on Form 10-K for the five years ended
      December 31, 2000;

    - a number of Dean's and Suiza's interim reports to stockholders and
      quarterly reports on Form 10-Q;

    - a number of other communications from Dean and Suiza to their respective
      stockholders; and

    - a number of internal financial analyses and forecasts for Dean prepared by
      its management and for Suiza prepared by its management, both of which
      included certain cost savings, operating synergies and impacts of proposed
      divestitures projected by the managements of Dean and Suiza to result from
      the merger and the related transactions, including, in the case of those
      forecasts provided by Suiza's management, as adjusted by Dean's management
      (referred to below as the synergies and divestiture impacts).

    Goldman Sachs also held discussions with members of Dean's and Suiza's
senior managements regarding their assessments of the strategic rationale for,
and the potential benefits of, the merger and the past and current business
operations, financial condition and future prospects of each of their companies.
In addition, Goldman Sachs reviewed the reported price and trading activity for
Dean's common stock and Suiza's common stock, compared certain financial and
stock market information for Dean and Suiza with similar information for certain
other companies the securities of which are publicly traded, and reviewed the
financial terms of certain recent business combinations in the dairy, commodity
food and branded food and beverage industries specifically and in other
industries generally. Goldman Sachs also performed such other studies and
analyses that it considered appropriate.

    Goldman Sachs relied upon the accuracy and completeness of all of the
financial, accounting and other information discussed with or reviewed by it and
assumed the accuracy and completeness of that financial, accounting and other
information for purposes of rendering its opinion. In addition, Goldman Sachs
did not make an independent evaluation or appraisal of the assets and
liabilities of Dean or Suiza, nor was any provided to Goldman Sachs. Goldman
Sachs assumed, with the consent of Dean's board of directors, that the internal
financial forecasts prepared by Dean's and Suiza's managements, including the
synergies and divestiture impacts, were reasonably prepared on a basis
reflecting the then

best currently available estimates and judgments of Dean and Suiza. Goldman
Sachs also assumed that all material governmental, regulatory or other consents
and approvals necessary to close the merger will be obtained without any adverse
effect on Dean, Suiza or the combined company or the contemplated benefits of
the merger.

    In addition, Goldman Sachs was not requested to solicit, and did not
solicit, interest from other parties with respect to an acquisition of or other
business combination with Dean.

    The following is a summary of the material financial analyses used by
Goldman Sachs in connection with providing its opinion to Dean's board of
directors. Some of the summaries of the financial analyses include information
presented in table format. You should read the tables together with the full
text of each summary. The tables alone do not constitute a complete description
of the financial analyses.

    HISTORICAL TRADING ANALYSIS.  Goldman Sachs reviewed the historical trading
prices and volumes for Dean's and Suiza's common stock from April 3, 1998
through April 3, 2001. This analysis showed that the weighted average trading
price of Dean's common stock was $34.21 for the last three months of this
period, $32.43 for the last six months of this period, $31.45 for the last year
of this period and $37.48 for the entire three-year period. The weighted average
trading prices of Suiza's common stock was $47.37 for the last three months of
this period, $46.25 for the last six months of this period, $46.09 for the last
year of this period and $41.17 for the entire three-year period.

    SELECTED COMPANIES ANALYSIS.  Goldman Sachs reviewed and compared certain
financial and stock market information for Dean with 14 selected publicly traded
food industry companies with an equity market capitalization ranging from
approximately $320 million to approximately $4 billion, referred to in the table
below as mid-cap food industry companies, and 14 selected publicly traded food
industry companies with equity market capitalizations of more than $9 billion,
referred to in the table below as large-cap food industry companies. Goldman
Sachs selected these companies because they are publicly traded companies with
operations that for purposes of this analysis may be considered similar to Dean.
However, none of the companies used in the selected companies analysis is
identical to Dean or Suiza. The market data and financial information were based
on publicly available financial statements and the earnings estimates were based
on analysts' estimates from IBES, Inc., a data service that compiles estimates
of securities research analysts.

    The following table presents Dean's enterprise value (which is composed of
Dean's equity market capitalization, together with its outstanding debt net of
cash) as a multiple of Dean's latest twelve months of (1) sales, (2) earnings
before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA), and
(3) earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT). The table also presents Dean's
price-to-projected earnings ratios for calendar years 2001 and 2002, based on an
assumed Dean stock price and assumed

total merger consideration. The table then compares this Dean information to the
means and medians presented for the selected mid-cap and large-cap food industry
companies as a group.

    SELECTED TRANSACTION ANALYSIS.  Goldman Sachs reviewed publicly available
information for selected merger or acquisition transactions in the dairy and
commodity food industries in the last ten years. The following table sets forth
the high, mean, median and low enterprise value to sales, EBITDA and EBIT of the
selected comparable transactions, calculated in each case based on available
information for the latest twelve months prior to each transaction:

    DISCOUNTED CASH FLOW ANALYSIS OF DEAN.  Goldman Sachs performed a discounted
cash flow analysis to determine a range of implied present values per share of
Dean's common stock. Cash flows were discounted to the end of March 2001. In
performing this analysis, Goldman Sachs used estimates supplied by Dean's
management, discount rates ranging from 9.0% to 13.0% and multiples of terminal
year 2005 estimated EBITDA ranging from 5.5x to 7.5x. This analysis resulted in
implied per share present values ranging from $34.24 to $58.11.

    Using Dean's management's estimates, Goldman Sachs then performed a
sensitivity analysis with respect to sales growth and EBIT margin. The analysis
was based on an 11.0% discount rate and multiple of terminal year 2005 estimated
EBITDA of 6.5x and used a range of changes in sales growth ranging from a
decrease by 4.0% to an increase by 4.0% and a range of changes in EBIT margin

ranging from a decrease by 1.0% to an increase by 1.0%. This analysis resulted
in implied per share present values ranging from $27.57 to $67.17.

    ILLUSTRATIVE FUTURE MARKET TRADING PRICES ANALYSIS

    DEAN.  Goldman Sachs estimated the range of possible present values of the
estimated future stock price of Dean, as a stand-alone company, to Dean
stockholders. In order to estimate the company's future stock price, Goldman
Sachs used Dean management's projections of earnings per share for Dean on a
stand-alone basis for fiscal years 2001-2004, adjusted such projections to
calendar years ending December 31, 2001-2003, and applied potential one-year
forward price/earnings multiples for Dean ranging from 9.0x to 12.0x. Further,
Goldman Sachs added the payment of assumed dividends of $0.89 in calendar year
2001, $0.91 in calendar year 2002 and $0.93 in calendar year 2003 to the
resulting future stock price in those calendar years. Goldman Sachs then applied
discount rates ranging from 9.0% to 12.0% to calculate the present value of the
future stock price. Goldman Sachs noted that the possible present value of the
future stock price of Dean on a stand-alone basis ranged from $26.88 to $40.40.

    COMBINED COMPANY.  Goldman Sachs estimated the range of possible present
values of the total consideration to be paid to Dean stockholders. Goldman Sachs
assumed that the cash consideration was received tax-free and reinvested in
Suiza stock at Suiza's market price as of April 3, 2001, and then estimated the
range of possible present values of the estimated future stock price of the
combined company to Dean stockholders. Goldman Sachs used Dean management's
projections of GAAP earnings per share for Dean on a stand-alone basis for
fiscal years 2001-2004, adjusted the earnings assuming the effectiveness of the
then proposed new Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) rules (regarding
the non-amortization of goodwill) and then adjusted such projections to calendar
year end 2001-2003. Goldman Sachs used estimates for Suiza GAAP earnings per
share, which were prepared by Suiza's management for calendar year 2001, and
used estimates of IBES, Inc. for earnings per share for calendar years 2002 and
2003, in each case adjusting the earnings assuming the effectiveness of the then
proposed new FASB rules (regarding the non-amortization of goodwill). Goldman
Sachs estimated the pro forma earnings of the combined company for calendar
years 2001, 2002 and 2003, assuming achievement of synergies (net of divestiture
impacts) in calendar years 2001, 2002 and 2003 as estimated by Dean management's
projections and Suiza management's projections, as adjusted by Dean management.
Goldman Sachs estimated the range of possible future stock prices by applying
potential one-year forward price/earnings multiples for the combined
company--ranging from 8.0x to 12.0x--to the estimated earnings per share for the
combined company. Goldman Sachs then applied discount rates ranging from 9.0% to
12.0% to calculate the present value of the future stock price. Goldman Sachs
noted that the implied present value per share to Dean stockholders ranged from
$34.89 to $62.97.

    The preparation of a fairness opinion is a complex process which makes it
difficult to provide a partial analysis or summary description. Selecting
portions of the analyses or of the summary set forth above, without considering
the analyses as a whole, could create an incomplete view of the processes
underlying Goldman Sachs' opinion. In arriving at its fairness determination,
Goldman Sachs considered the results of each of these analyses in their
totality. No company or transaction used in the above analyses as a comparison
is directly comparable to Dean or Suiza or the proposed merger. The analyses
were prepared solely for purposes of Goldman Sachs' providing its opinion to
Dean's board of directors as to the fairness from a financial point of view of
the per share merger consideration to Dean's stockholders. The analyses are not
appraisals and do not necessarily reflect the prices at which businesses or
securities actually may be sold. Analyses based upon forecasts of future results
are not necessarily indicative of actual future results, which may be
significantly more or less favorable than suggested by those analyses. Because
these analyses are inherently subject to uncertainty, being based upon numerous
factors or events beyond the control of the parties or their advisors, none of
Dean,

Suiza, Goldman Sachs or any other person assumes responsibility if future
results are materially different from those forecast. As described above,
Goldman Sachs' opinion to Dean's board of directors was one of many factors
taken into consideration by Dean's board of directors in making its
determination to approve the merger agreement and the merger. This summary is
not a complete description of the analysis performed by Goldman Sachs. If you
are a Dean stockholder, you should read the written opinion of Goldman Sachs set
forth in Annex B.

    INTEREST OF GOLDMAN SACHS IN THE MERGER

    Goldman Sachs, as part of its investment banking business, is continually
engaged in the valuation of businesses and their securities in connection with
mergers and acquisitions, negotiated underwritings, competitive biddings,
secondary distributions of listed and unlisted securities, private placements
and valuations for estate, corporate and other purposes. Goldman Sachs is
familiar with Dean, having provided certain investment banking services to Dean
from time to time, including having acted as underwriter of public offerings of
$250,000,000 aggregate principal amount of 8.15% Senior Notes due 2007 of Dean,
$200,000,000 aggregate principal amount of 6.625% Senior Notes due 2009 of Dean
and $150,000,000 aggregate principal amount of 6.9% Senior Notes due 2017 of
Dean, having acted as a dealer in Dean's commercial paper. Goldman Sachs also
acted as Dean's financial advisor in connection with, and participated in
certain of the negotiations leading to, the merger agreement, and may provide
investment banking services to Suiza in the future. Goldman Sachs provides a
full range of financial advisory and securities services and, in the course of
its normal trading activities, may from time to time effect transactions and
hold securities, including derivative securities, of Dean or Suiza for its own
account and for the accounts of customers.

    Pursuant to a letter agreement dated March 20, 2000, Dean engaged Goldman
Sachs to act as its financial advisor in connection with, among other things, a
possible transaction with Suiza. Pursuant to the terms of the letter agreement,
Dean (1) agreed to pay Goldman Sachs an annual advisory fee of $250,000, payable
on the date of the execution of the letter agreement and on each anniversary of
the date of the letter agreement so long as Dean continued to retain Goldman
Sachs (and paid Goldman Sachs such $250,000 advisory fees in each of March 2000
and March 2001, (2) paid Goldman Sachs when the merger agreement was signed a
fee of $2,500,000, and (3) has agreed to pay Goldman Sachs, when the merger
occurs, a transactional fee equal to 0.725% of the aggregate consideration paid
in the merger, reduced by the $250,000 annual advisory fee paid less than one
year prior to the merger and the $2,500,000 fee previously paid when the merger
agreement was signed. Dean also agreed to reimburse Goldman Sachs for its
reasonable out-of-pocket expenses, including attorney's fees, and to indemnify
Goldman Sachs against certain liabilities, including certain liabilities under
the federal securities laws.

OPINIONS OF SUIZA'S FINANCIAL ADVISORS

    Pursuant to a letter agreement dated March 19, 2001, Suiza retained Bear
Stearns and Morgan Stanley to act as its financial advisors in connection with
the merger. Suiza's board of directors selected Bear Stearns and Morgan Stanley
to act as Suiza's financial advisors based on each firm's qualifications,
expertise, reputation and knowledge of Suiza's business and affairs. At Suiza's
board of directors meeting on April 4, 2001, Bear Stearns and Morgan Stanley
each provided an oral opinion, subsequently confirmed by each in written
opinions dated April 4, 2001, that, as of that date, and based upon and subject
to the various considerations set forth in the respective opinions, the per
share merger consideration to be paid by Suiza pursuant to the merger agreement
was fair from a financial point of view to Suiza.

STANLEY, EACH DATED APRIL 4, 2001, ARE ATTACHED AS ANNEXES C AND D TO THIS JOINT
PROXY STATEMENT/PROSPECTUS. EACH OPINION SETS FORTH ASSUMPTIONS MADE, PROCEDURES

CONSIDERATION TO BE PAID BY SUIZA PURSUANT TO THE MERGER AGREEMENT. THE WRITTEN
OPINIONS OF BEAR STEARNS AND MORGAN STANLEY DO NOT ADDRESS ANY OTHER ASPECT OF
THE TRANSACTION AND ARE NOT RECOMMENDATIONS TO SUIZA'S STOCKHOLDERS AS TO HOW TO

SUMMARY OF THE OPINIONS OF BEAR STEARNS AND MORGAN STANLEY AND IS QUALIFIED IN
ITS ENTIRETY BY REFERENCE TO THE FULL TEXT OF THE OPINIONS. IF YOU ARE A SUIZA
STOCKHOLDER, YOU ARE URGED TO CAREFULLY READ THE ENTIRE OPINIONS IN ANNEXES C
AND D.

    Neither Bear Stearns' nor Morgan Stanley's opinion addresses the merits of
the underlying business decision by Suiza to engage in the merger and related
transactions. In addition, neither Bear Stearns' nor Morgan Stanley's opinion
addresses the prices at which the Suiza common stock will actually trade at any
time and neither Bear Stearns nor Morgan Stanley expresses any recommendation or
opinion as to how the holders of Suiza common stock should vote at Suiza's
special meeting.

    OPINION OF BEAR STEARNS

projections and estimates of the synergies expected to result from the merger,
provided to Bear Stearns by Suiza's management. With respect to the projected
financial results of each of Suiza and Dean and the potential synergies that
could be achieved upon consummation of the merger, Bear Stearns assumed, with
Suiza's consent, that the information provided was reasonably prepared on bases
reflecting the best currently available estimates and judgments of senior
managements of Suiza and Dean as to the expected future performance of Suiza and
Dean. Bear Stearns did not assume any responsibility for the independent
verification of any such information or of the projections and estimates of the
potential synergies provided to it.

    In arriving at its opinion, Bear Stearns did not perform or obtain any
independent appraisal of the assets or liabilities (contingent or otherwise) of
Suiza or Dean, nor was it furnished with any such appraisals. Bear Stearns
assumed that:

    - the merger will qualify as a tax-free reorganization for federal income
      tax purposes;

    - the final form of each of the merger agreement and the agreements for the
      related transactions would not vary in any respect material to its
      analysis of the last drafts provided to it; and

    - the merger and the related transactions would each be consummated in a
      timely manner and in accordance with the terms of the merger agreement and
      agreements for the related transactions, in each case, without any

the accuracy and completeness of the information reviewed by it for the purposes
of its opinion. In relying on the financial statements and the other financial
and operating data provided by Suiza and Dean, including financial projections
and information relating to certain strategic, financial and operational
benefits anticipated from the merger, Morgan Stanley assumed, with Suiza's

valuation or appraisal of the assets or liabilities of Suiza or Dean, nor was

necessarily based on financial, economic, market and other conditions in effect
on, and the information made available to Morgan Stanley as of, April 4, 2001.

    Morgan Stanley assumed, with Suiza's consent, that the merger and the
related transactions would be consummated in a timely manner and in accordance
with the terms set forth in the merger agreement and the agreements for the
related transactions, and that obtaining all necessary regulatory approvals for

PRESENTATION TO SUIZA'S BOARD OF DIRECTORS

    THE FOLLOWING IS A SUMMARY OF THE MATERIAL FINANCIAL ANALYSES JOINTLY
PERFORMED BY BEAR STEARNS AND MORGAN STANLEY AND JOINTLY PRESENTED TO SUIZA'S
BOARD OF DIRECTORS ON APRIL 4, 2001, IN CONNECTION WITH THE RENDERING OF THE
ORAL AND WRITTEN OPINIONS OF BEAR STEARNS AND MORGAN STANLEY. BEAR STEARNS AND
MORGAN STANLEY JOINTLY PREPARED THE PRESENTATION MADE TO SUIZA'S BOARD OF
DIRECTORS AND EACH OF THEM RELIED ON THE ANALYSES INCLUDED IN THE PRESENTATION
IN RENDERING THEIR OPINIONS.

    While the following summaries describe the material analyses and factors
reviewed by Bear Stearns and Morgan Stanley for their opinions, the descriptions
are not intended to be a comprehensive description of all the analyses performed
and factors considered by Bear Stearns and Morgan Stanley in arriving at their
opinions. The preparation of a fairness opinion is a complex process involving
the application of subjective business judgment in determining the most
appropriate and relevant methods of financial analysis and, therefore, is not
necessarily susceptible to partial analysis or summary description. In arriving
at their opinions, Bear Stearns and Morgan Stanley considered the results of all
of their analyses as a whole. Furthermore, Bear Stearns and Morgan Stanley
believe that selecting any portion of their analyses, without considering all
analyses, would create an incomplete view of the processes underlying their
opinions. In addition, Bear Stearns and Morgan Stanley may have given

various analyses and factors more or less weight than other analyses and factors
and may have deemed various assumptions more or less probable than other
assumptions, so that the ranges of valuations resulting from any particular
analysis described below should not be taken to be the views of either Bear
Stearns or Morgan Stanley of the actual value of Suiza or Dean.

    Some of these summaries of financial analyses include information presented
in tabular format. In order to understand fully the financial analyses used by
Bear Stearns and Morgan Stanley, the tables must be read together with the text
of each summary. The tables alone do not constitute a complete description of
the financial analyses.

    HISTORICAL PUBLIC MARKET TRADING VALUE.  Bear Stearns and Morgan Stanley
reviewed the recent stock price performance of Suiza and Dean based on an
analysis of the historical closing prices and trading volumes for the period
beginning April 5, 1999, and ending April 3, 2001, each as reported on the New
York Stock Exchange. The following table lists the low and high daily closing
prices of shares of Suiza common stock and Dean common stock for this period.

                                                                  HISTORICAL

    COMPARABLE PUBLICLY TRADED COMPANIES ANALYSIS.  Bear Stearns and Morgan
Stanley compared financial information of Suiza and Dean with financial
information for nine publicly traded companies which Bear Stearns and Morgan
Stanley deemed generally comparable to Suiza and Dean. The companies included
the following three baking companies and six commodity food companies:

          BAKING COMPANIES                   COMMODITY FOOD COMPANIES
- -------------------------------------  -------------------------------------

Earthgrains Company                    Del Monte Foods Company
Flowers Foods, Inc.                    Dole Food Company, Inc.
Interstate Bakeries Corp.              Fresh Del Monte Produce, Inc.
                                       Pilgrim's Pride Corp.
                                       Smithfield Foods, Inc.
                                       Tyson Foods, Inc.

    Bear Stearns and Morgan Stanley analyzed, among other things, the current
enterprise value (i.e., market value of equity adjusted for capital structure)
of each company expressed as a multiple of last twelve months (LTM) earnings
before expenses for interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA), and
the market price per share of each company's common stock on April 3, 2001,
expressed as a multiple of estimated calendar year 2001 net earnings per share.
As of April 3, 2001, and based on estimates of net earnings per share taken from
securities research analysts, in the case of the comparable publicly traded
companies, and from financial projections prepared by Suiza's management, in the

(1) Harmonic mean is calculated by taking the reciprocal of the arithmetic mean
    of the reciprocals of the applicable multiples and is used to give equal
    investment weight to each of the comparable companies.

    No company used in the comparable publicly traded companies analysis is
identical to Suiza or Dean. In evaluating the comparable publicly traded
companies analysis, Bear Stearns and Morgan Stanley made judgments and
assumptions with regard to industry performance, general business, economic,
market and financial conditions and other matters, many of which are beyond the
control of Suiza and Dean. These other matters include the impact of competition
on Suiza, Dean and the comparable companies and the industries in which they are
principally engaged, such industries' growth and the absence of any material
adverse change in the financial condition and prospects of Suiza, Dean or the
comparable companies or the industries in which they are principally engaged or
in the financial markets in general.

    ANALYSIS OF SELECTED PRECEDENT TRANSACTIONS.  As part of their analyses,
Bear Stearns and Morgan Stanley reviewed publicly available information
regarding the following nine transactions since 1997 involving companies which
operate in the dairy industry:

     DATE                             ACQUIROR                                     TARGET

September 2000  Dean Foods Company                                    Land O' Lakes, Inc.

September 1999  Suiza Foods Corporation                               Southern Foods Group, L.P.

April 1999      Parmalat Finanziaria SpA                              Farmland Dairies, Inc.

                                                                      (tablespreads and egg-substitutes
                                                                      businesses)

November 1997   Saputo Group Inc.                                     Stella Foods, Inc.

    For each of these transactions, Bear Stearns and Morgan Stanley reviewed the
prices paid and analyzed the implied enterprise value of the acquired company as
a multiple of LTM EBITDA. This analysis indicated multiples ranging from 5.9x to
9.0x LTM EBITDA for these transactions, with a median multiple of 7.9x and a
harmonic mean of 7.7x. Bear Stearns and Morgan Stanley also analyzed the
enterprise value as a multiple of LTM EBITDA for Dean implied by the per share
merger consideration. Based on EBITDA for Dean for the LTM period ended
February 28, 2001, as adjusted by Suiza management, the per share merger
consideration implied a multiple of 6.9x, based on a closing share price for
Suiza of $46.39 on April 3, 2001.

    No transaction used in the analysis of selected precedent transactions is
identical to the merger. In evaluating these transactions, Bear Stearns and
Morgan Stanley made judgments and assumptions with regard to industry
performance, business, economic, market and financial conditions an other
matters, many of which are beyond the control of Suiza and Dean. These other
matters include the impact of competition on Suiza, Dean, or the companies
involved in the precedent transactions and the industries in which they are
principally engaged, such industries' growth and the absence of any material
adverse change in the financial condition and prospects of Suiza, Dean or the
companies involved in the precedent transactions or the industries in which they
are principally engaged or in the financial markets in general.

    DISCOUNTED CASH FLOW ANALYSIS.  Bear Stearns and Morgan Stanley performed a
discounted cash flow analysis of Dean using a financial forecast for Dean
prepared by Dean's management as adjusted

and projected by Suiza. Bear Stearns and Morgan Stanley calculated Dean's
discounted cash flow value by using discount rates ranging from 7.5% to 9.0% and
terminal values based on perpetual annual growth rates for unlevered free cash
flow of 0.5% to 1.5%. This analysis yielded a range of per share values for Dean
common stock of $32.75 to $51.50.

    SECURITIES RESEARCH ANALYSTS' DISCOUNTED PRICE TARGETS FOR SUIZA COMMON
STOCK.  Bear Stearns and Morgan Stanley reviewed and analyzed future public
market trading price targets for Suiza common stock prepared and published by
securities research analysts during the period from February 15, 2001, to
March 9, 2001. These targets reflected each research analyst's estimate of the
future public market trading price of Suiza common stock at the end of the
particular time period considered for each estimate. Using a discount rate of
10.5%, Suiza's cost of equity as estimated using the capital asset pricing
model, Bear Stearns and Morgan Stanley discounted these estimates to April 3,
2001 to arrive at a range of present values of these targets of $45 to $59 per
Suiza common share.

    Bear Stearns and Morgan Stanley noted that the public market trading prices
published by the securities research analysts do not reflect current market
trading prices for Suiza common stock and that these estimates are subject to
uncertainties, including the future financial performance of Suiza and future
financial market conditions.

    PRO FORMA ANALYSIS OF THE TRANSACTION.  Bear Stearns and Morgan Stanley
analyzed the impact of the merger, pro forma as if the merger closed on
January 1, 2001, on Suiza and observed that, based on financial projections for
Suiza and estimates of synergies, each as prepared by Suiza's management, and on
a financial forecast for Dean prepared by Dean's management as adjusted and
projected by Suiza's management, the transaction would result in accretion to
cash earnings per share for Suiza stockholders in calendar year 2001 and
accretion to current GAAP earnings per share for Suiza stockholders in calendar
year 2002. Bear Stearns and Morgan Stanley also noted that the pro forma
analysis suggested that the transaction would result in a more leveraged capital
structure for Suiza.

    In performing their analyses, Bear Stearns and Morgan Stanley made numerous
assumptions with respect to industry performance, general business and economic
conditions and other matters, many of which are beyond the control of Suiza or
Dean. Any estimates contained in the financial advisors' analyses are not
necessarily indicative of future results or actual values, which may be
significantly more or less favorable than those suggested by the estimates.
These analyses were prepared solely as part of the analyses of Bear Stearns and
Morgan Stanley of the fairness to Suiza from a financial point of view of the
per share merger consideration to be paid by Suiza and were conducted in
connection with the delivery of the opinions of Bear Stearns and Morgan Stanley
to Suiza's board of directors.

    The per share merger consideration to be paid by Suiza and other terms of
the merger were determined through arm's-length negotiations between Suiza and
Dean and were approved by Suiza's board of directors. Bear Stearns and Morgan
Stanley provided advice to Suiza during the negotiations; however, neither Bear
Stearns nor Morgan Stanley recommended any specific merger consideration to
Suiza or that any given merger consideration constituted the only appropriate
consideration for the merger. As described above, the opinions of Bear Stearns
and Morgan Stanley were among many factors taken into consideration by Suiza's
board of directors in making its decision to approve the merger and related
transactions. Consequently, the analyses of Bear Stearns and Morgan Stanley as
described above should not be viewed as determinative of whether Suiza's board
of directors would have been willing to agree to a different amount or form of
merger consideration to be paid by Suiza in connection with the merger.

    INTERESTS OF BEAR STEARNS AND MORGAN STANLEY IN THE MERGER

    Each of Bear Stearns and Morgan Stanley is an internationally recognized
investment banking and advisory firm. Each of Bear Stearns and Morgan Stanley,
as part of its investment banking and financial advisory businesses, is
continuously engaged in the valuation of businesses and securities in

connection with mergers and acquisitions, negotiated underwritings, competitive
biddings, secondary distributions of listed and unlisted securities, private
placements and valuations for corporate and other purposes.

    Bear Stearns previously has been engaged by Suiza to provide certain
investment banking and financial advisory services for which Bear Stearns
received customary fees. In the ordinary course of business, Bear Stearns may
actively trade the equity and debt securities of Suiza and Dean for its own
account and for the account of its customers and, accordingly, may at any time
hold a long or short position in such securities.

    In the ordinary course of business, Morgan Stanley and its affiliates may
from time to time trade in the securities or indebtedness of Suiza or Dean for
its own account, the accounts of investment funds and other clients under the
management of Morgan Stanley and for the accounts of customers and, accordingly,
may at any time hold a long or short position in such securities or
indebtedness. In the past, Morgan Stanley and its affiliates have provided
financial advisory and financing services for Dean and have received fees for
the rendering of these services.

    Pursuant to their engagement letter with Suiza, Bear Stearns and Morgan
Stanley provided financial advisory services and financial fairness opinions to
Suiza in connection with the merger and Suiza agreed to pay an aggregate fee of
$12 million to Bear Stearns and Morgan Stanley in respect of the services
provided. A substantial portion of this fee is contingent on successful
consummation of the merger. Suiza has also agreed to reimburse Bear Stearns and
Morgan Stanley for their expenses incurred in performing their services. In
addition, Suiza has agreed to indemnify each of Bear Stearns and Morgan Stanley
and their affiliates, their respective directors, officers, agents and employees
and each person, if any, controlling Bear Stearns or Morgan Stanley or any of
their affiliates against certain liabilities and expenses, including certain
liabilities under the federal securities laws, related to or arising out of the
engagement of Bear Stearns and Morgan Stanley.

                   INTERESTS OF CERTAIN PERSONS IN THE MERGER

    In considering the recommendations of Dean's board of directors with respect
to the merger, you should be aware that certain members of the management and
the board of directors of Dean have interests in the merger that may be
different from, or in addition to, the interests of the other stockholders of
Dean.

    Agreements between Dean and its directors, officers and employees described
below provide that if Dean's stockholders approve the merger, the stock option,
stock award or other benefit provided in such agreement will vest, and the
director, officer or employee will have the right to receive certain cash and
stock awards and/or the right to receive certain payments if their employment is
terminated, as provided in these agreements. Dean expects to amend such
agreements to provide that such persons will only receive those benefits if the
merger occurs. The description of the agreements below assumes that such
amendments have been made.

    In certain cases, if the payments or other benefits described below, either
alone or together with other benefits, would constitute a "parachute payment"
under Section 280G of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, the combined company
will be required to reimburse the employee receiving the payment or other
benefit for the Federal excise taxes that are imposed on those payments or other
benefits plus the additional taxes due on the reimbursement. Reimbursements for
these potential amounts to 18 of Dean's officers could approximate $6 million.

TERMINATION AND CHANGE IN CONTROL BENEFITS

    Dean is a party to agreements with 18 of its officers which provide that in
the event the officer's employment is terminated within two years after a
"change in control" of Dean, other than at

retirement after the officer's "normal retirement date," a termination for "good
cause," death, or being permanently disabled for six months, the officer will be
paid certain guaranteed amounts. These guaranteed amounts are also payable if
the officer voluntarily terminates employment within the 60-day period that
begins on the first anniversary of the merger. The guaranteed payments include
all salary and accrued vacation through the date of termination, incentive
compensation accrued but not yet paid for the preceding year, prorated incentive
compensation for the current year, and two times the officer's base salary and
annual incentive bonus, plus the cost of financial planning and tax preparation
services for the most recent year. In addition, during the two years following
such termination (or any lesser period until the executive's death, disability
or normal retirement date), the combined company will continue all health,
dental, life, accident and disability coverage for the officer, or will arrange
for substantially the same benefits for the officer. The coverage described in
the preceding sentence is in each case subject to offset for any substantially
similar benefits provided by a new employer. The officer will also be provided
certain outplacement services and will be given credit under the Supplemental
Benefit Plan for service during the two-year period, and his or her compensation
for purposes of this plan will reflect the payments referred to above. Dean also
agreed to reimburse the executive for legal fees and expenses incurred by any of
these officers in enforcing any right or benefit provided by the change in
control agreements. For purposes of these agreements, the completion of the
merger will constitute a "change in control" of Dean, entitling the officers to
the benefits under the agreements, and the combined company will assume the
obligation to pay these benefits. If all of the payments are triggered, the
total cash payment, excluding tax reimbursements, would be approximately
$15 million.

DEAN'S STOCK OPTIONS

    1989 STOCK AWARDS PLAN

    Under Dean's 1989 Stock Awards Plan, certain of Dean's officers and certain
employees have been granted incentive options or non-qualified options to
purchase shares of Dean common stock at the market value of the common stock on
the date of grant, stock appreciation rights and/or restricted Dean common
stock, and performance shares awards. As of             , 2001, options to
purchase       shares of Dean common stock (which will automatically convert
into options to purchase Suiza stock as described under "The Merger and the
Merger Agreement--Treatment of Dean Stock Options and Other Equity Interests" on
page 49) are held by Dean officers and employees pursuant to this plan. When
granted, the options became exercisable 25% per year, commencing one year after
the grant. As of            , 2001, options to purchase         shares of Dean's
stock (which will automatically convert into options to purchase Suiza stock as
described under "The Merger and the Merger Agreement--Treatment of Dean Stock
Options and Other Equity Interests" on page 49) are not exercisable. When the
merger occurs, all of the options that are not currently exercisable will become
exercisable. All options not exercised before the merger will be converted into
options to acquire Suiza common stock.

    Eighteen of Dean's key employees are covered by performance awards
agreements issued under the 1989 Stock Awards Plan pursuant to which they are
entitled to cash payments if Dean's earnings per share meets certain performance
levels. If Dean's earnings per share are less than the target, the employee may
be entitled to a smaller payment, and if Dean's earnings per share exceed the
target, the employee is entitled to a larger payment up to a maximum of 200% of
the award that would be paid had the earnings per share met or exceeded the
target. If the merger occurs, all awards that were granted at least one year
prior to the completion of the merger will be vested and the employees'
performance goals will automatically be considered to be satisfied at the 100%
level in calculating the amount of the award. The award will be payable in cash
or in shares of Suiza's stock, at the election of the employee, subject to the
same conversion formula that applies to all other stock-based awards under
Dean's 1989 Stock Awards Plan. See "The Merger and the Merger
Agreement--Treatment of

Dean Stock Options and Other Equity Interests" on page 49. If each of these
employees elects to receive cash, the total payments to employees would be
approximately $4.0 million. If any employee elects to receive Suiza shares, he
or she will receive 115% of the number of shares that his or her cash award
otherwise would have purchased. Shares will not be distributed to the employee
until one year after the date the merger occurs.

    1996 DIRECTOR STOCK AWARDS PLAN

    Under Dean's 1996 Director Stock Awards Plan, the non-employee members of
Dean's board of directors have been granted non-qualified options to purchase
shares of Dean common stock at the market value on the date of grant, stock
appreciation rights and/or restricted Dean common stock. As of             ,
2001, options to purchase       shares of Dean's stock (which will automatically
convert into options to purchase Suiza stock as described under "The Merger and
the Merger Agreement--Treatment of Dean Stock Options and Other Equity
Interests" on page 49) are held by Dean directors pursuant to this plan. When
granted, the options became exercisable 33 1/3% per year, commencing one year
after the grant. As of            , 2001, options to purchase         shares of
Dean's stock (which will automatically convert into options to purchase Suiza
stock as described under "The Merger and the Merger Agreement--Treatment of Dean
Stock Options and Other Equity Interests" on page 49) are not exercisable. When
the merger occurs, all of the options that are not currently exercisable will
become exercisable. All options not exercised before the merger will be
converted into options to purchase Suiza stock, subject to the same conversion
formula that applies to all other stock-based awards under Dean's 1989 Stock
Awards Plan. See "The Merger and the Merger Agreement--Treatment of Dean Stock
Options and Other Equity Interests" on page 49. A director may, in lieu of
exercising the option, surrender it to the combined company in return for a cash
payment equal to (1) the highest fair market value of Dean stock during the
thirty days preceding or succeeding the completion of the merger less (2) the
exercise price of the option.

DEFERRED COMPENSATION PLANS

    Under Dean's Deferred Compensation Plan and Directors Deferred Compensation
Plan, certain key employees and directors have elected to defer a portion of
their compensation until after termination of their employment. Deferrals earn
interest at a guaranteed rate. If a change in control occurs, the committee that
administers the plan may elect to pay the deferred compensation to the
participants.

SUPPLEMENTAL BENEFIT PLAN

    The Dean Supplemental Benefit Plan provides retirement benefits in excess of
the benefits payable under the Dean pension and savings plans for approximately
65 employees. The benefit amount payable under the Supplemental Benefit Plan is
equal to the sum of (1) the matching and profit sharing contributions that would
have been made to the savings plan but for the compensation limitations
applicable to the savings plan under the Internal Revenue Code, and (2) the
benefit that the employees cannot receive under the pension plan because of the
compensation and benefit limitations of the Internal Revenue Code. Individuals
who were officers of Dean as of October 1, 1996 are entitled to some minimum
benefit guarantees. Immediately prior to a change in control, Dean will be
required to establish a trust, commonly called a rabbi trust, and to pay
approximately $14 million to such trust, which represents the projected value of
the benefits payable under the Supplemental Benefit Plan.

MERGER SEVERANCE PLAN

    Each Dean employee at the Rosemont, Franklin Park and Rockford, Illinois
facilities will be entitled to benefits under the Merger Severance Plan if
within one year after the merger (1) the employee is involuntarily terminated
other than for cause or as a result of disability, (2) his or her

compensation is reduced, or (3) the employee declines a relocation of greater
than 50 miles from his or her current place of employment. The amount of
severance required to be paid varies based on the job classification and years
of service of the employee. Option-eligible employees and above are entitled to
2 weeks of pay for each year of service with a minimum of 26 weeks and a maximum
of 52 weeks and a prorated bonus payment. Bonus-eligible employees are entitled
to 1.5 weeks of pay for each year of service with a minimum of 21 weeks and a
maximum of 52 weeks and a prorated bonus payment. Non-bonus-level "exempt
employees" are entitled to 1.5 weeks of pay for each year of service with a
minimum of 17 weeks and a maximum of 52 weeks. "Nonexempt" and hourly employees
are entitled to 1 week of pay for each year of service with a minimum of 13
weeks and a maximum of 26 weeks. Health, dental and life insurance benefits will
continue during the severance period and the combined company will be obligated
to provide limited outplacement assistance and pay for unused vacation time.

DEAN DISCRETIONARY STAY BONUS POOL

    Dean has established a plan under which it will pay up to $5.0 million in
bonuses to approximately 180 employees who remain in the employ of the combined
company for four months following the merger, unless such employee is terminated
prior to such date. If the merger agreement is terminated, the stay bonuses will
be paid to the eligible employees who are employed by Dean at the time the
agreement is terminated.

DEAN RESIGNATION AND RETIREMENT PAYMENTS

    Dean has agreed to make various payments and provide certain continuing
benefits to Richard E. Bailey, its former President and Chief Operating Officer,
in connection with his resignation, including the value of continuing life,
health and dental insurance, outplacement services and financial counseling
services. Of these payment and benefit amounts, $1.35 million is contingent upon
the closing of the merger. In addition, Mr. Bailey's outstanding stock options
became immediately exercisable on April 30, 2001.

INDEMNIFICATION; DIRECTORS' AND OFFICERS' INSURANCE

    The combined company is obligated, for six years after the merger, to
maintain in effect Dean's current directors' and officers' liability insurance
covering acts or omissions occurring prior to the time the merger occurs, with
the limitation that the combined company is not required to expend on annual
premiums for this insurance more than twice the amount of the annual premiums
paid by Dean prior to the merger.

    The combined company is obligated, to the fullest extent permitted by law,
to indemnify and hold harmless, and provide advancement of expenses to, each
person who is or has been an officer or director of Dean with respect to acts or
omissions by them in their capacities as officers, directors or employees of
Dean or taken at the request of Dean at any time on or prior to the effective
time of the merger, including for acts and omissions occurring in connection
with the approval of the merger agreement and the merger.

                         SUIZA'S OPTION PLAN PROPOSALS

REASONS FOR THE OPTION PLAN PROPOSALS

    Suiza believes that granting stock options to its key employees and
directors is an effective way to:

    - attract and retain the best available personnel for positions of
      substantial responsibility; and

    - align the interests of its key employees and directors with those of
      Suiza's stockholders.

    Suiza believes that when its employees and directors own stock in the
company, they are motivated to promote the company's success. Therefore, a
significant portion of Suiza's key employees' overall compensation consists of
stock options.

    As a result of the significant number of additional employees that the
combined company will have after the merger occurs, the number of shares
currently available for issuance under Suiza's stock option plan will be
insufficient to meet the combined company's needs after the merger to
effectively create incentives for management of the larger company.

    Therefore, Suiza proposes, if the merger occurs, to adopt Dean's Stock
Awards Plan and to increase the number of shares reserved for issuance under
Suiza's existing plan.

PROPOSAL TO ADOPT DEAN'S STOCK AWARDS PLAN

    In connection with the merger, a number of shares of Suiza's common stock
will be reserved for issuance pursuant to stock-based awards outstanding at the
time of the merger under Dean's 1989 Stock Awards Plan (which will automatically
convert into options to purchase Suiza stock as described under "The Merger and
the Merger Agreement--Treatment of Dean Stock Options and Other Equity
Interests" on page 49). In addition, Suiza proposes to adopt Dean's 1989 Stock
Awards Plan, and reserve an additional 1,889,191 shares of Suiza's common stock
for issuance under the plan after the merger occurs.

    If the proposal is approved, Suiza will amend Dean's plan to provide that:

    - directors and key employees of Suiza and each of Suiza's affiliated
      companies, including Dean, will be eligible for grants under the plan;

    - non-employee directors will only be eligible for grants of nonqualified
      stock options, restricted stock and stock appreciation rights (SARs) under
      the plan;

    - stock-based awards granted under the plan will relate to the stock of
      Suiza rather than Dean; and

    - the limitation in Dean's plan that prevents Dean from issuing options to
      purchase more than 500,000 shares in a 10-year period to any one employee
      will not apply after the merger occurs.

    The following is a brief summary of some of the terms of the plan, as
expected to be amended. The full plan, as it will be amended and restated, is
attached as Annex F to this joint proxy statement/ prospectus.

ABOUT THE DEAN STOCK AWARDS PLAN

    - The Stock Option Committee of Suiza's board of directors will administer
      the plan. That committee is made up of only non-employee directors.

    - The Stock Option Committee may amend or discontinue the plan at any time
      subject to certain restrictions in the plan. Stockholder approval is
      required for some amendments, as required by the Internal Revenue Code and
      stock exchange rules. No amendment may adversely affect any

      previously granted option or other award, unless the holder of the award
      consents. No incentive stock options may be granted under the plan after
      July 24, 2007.

    - From time to time Suiza's Chief Executive Officer will recommend to the
      Stock Option Committee persons he believes should receive grants under the
      plan. The committee will consider, but need not accept, the Chief
      Executive Officer's recommendations.

    - The plan will be amended to allow for grants of stock options (incentive
      or nonqualified), restricted stock, SARs, performance share awards, and
      other awards authorized by the plan to key employees of Suiza (including
      employees who are directors) and its subsidiaries, including Dean and its
      subsidiaries, and grants of nonqualified stock options, restricted stock
      and SARs to non-employee directors. As of             , 2001 there were
            holders of options, restricted stock, SARs, and performance share
      awards under the plan.

    - The Stock Option Committee decides the terms of all grants and awards
      under the plan. However, incentive stock options must comply with certain
      requirements imposed by the Internal Revenue Code, including that the
      exercise price may not be less than the fair market value of the common
      stock on the grant date, and the term may not exceed 10 years.

    - Option exercise prices may be paid in cash or in shares of Suiza common
      stock or a combination of cash and shares.

    - The plan was originally adopted in 1989, and amended in each of 1994, 1997
      and 1999.

    - SARS. The Stock Option Committee may grant SARs to employees or
      non-employee directors in connection with or instead of an option. An
      employee or director who receives an SAR will receive on exercise the
      excess of the fair market value of a specified number of shares at the
      time of exercise over a specified price for such stock. The Stock Option
      Committee will decide whether to pay the amount in shares, cash or a
      combination of cash and shares, and may take into account any preference
      expressed by the holder of the SAR. The Stock Option Committee may also
      grant SARs as an alternative to a previously or contemporaneously granted
      option. In this case, the optionee will have a right to receive the excess
      of the fair market value of the shares the optionee would have purchased
      by exercising the option over the option price. The option is cancelled to
      the extent the SAR is exercised and the SAR is cancelled to the extent the
      option is exercised.

    - PERFORMANCE SHARES AWARDS. The Stock Option Committee may grant
      performance shares awards that will give an employee the right to receive
      payments based on whether performance goals are achieved during a period
      of at least one fiscal year determined by the committee. The payments may
      be in cash, shares, or a combination of cash or shares. The Stock Option
      Committee will set performance goals, which are tied to one or more
      financial performance criteria including return on invested capital, total
      stockholder return (i.e., appreciation in the market price of Suiza common
      stock plus dividends paid), return on stockholders' equity and/or earnings
      per share. The committee will also adopt a formula that will establish a
      range between a minimum level of achievement that must be attained before
      any amount will be paid, and a maximum level of achievement that will
      result in a maximum payment. No recipient of a performance shares award
      has any rights as a stockholder until certificates representing any shares
      earned under the award are issued to the recipient. The committee may
      impose restrictions on the transfer of shares issued pursuant to such
      awards. Except as otherwise provided by the committee, on a termination of
      employment during the performance measurement period, the performance
      shares award is forfeited by the employee.

    - OTHER AWARDS. The Stock Option Committee may grant other awards under the
      plan, either alone or in addition to options, SARs, restricted stock and
      performance shares awards. These may include convertible securities and
      other forms of award measured in whole or in part by the

      value of shares, the performance of the employee or the performance of
      Suiza or any affiliate. Such awards may be payable in shares, cash or a
      combination of cash and shares. The Stock Option Committee determines the
      numbers of shares to be awarded pursuant to such awards and all other
      conditions of the awards. In the case of awards involving the right to
      purchase shares, the purchase price may not be less than 85% of the fair
      market value of such shares at the time the award is granted and not less
      than the par value of such stock.

    - SUPPLEMENTAL CASH PAYMENTS. A non-qualified option or SAR agreement may
      provide that on exercise Suiza will make a cash payment to the holder of
      such non-qualified option or SAR based on a formula designed to reimburse
      the individual for any income tax liability resulting from such exercise.

    - Shares subject to options, restricted stock, SARs or performance shares
      award, or other award grants that are cancelled or forfeited become
      immediately available for re-issuance.

    See Annex G to this joint proxy statement/prospectus for tax information
about the plan.

PROPOSAL TO INCREASE SUIZA'S EXISTING OPTION PLAN

    In addition to adopting Dean's plan, Suiza also proposes to increase the
number of shares reserved for issuance under its existing option plan from
7.5 million to      million. Suiza's board of directors believes that both of
these actions are necessary to ensure that the combined company has a sufficient
pool of options and other stock awards to incent its expanded ranks of key
employees after the merger.

ABOUT SUIZA'S STOCK OPTION PLAN

    - As of             , 2001 there were          shares issuable under
      currently outstanding awards and          shares remaining available for
      issuance pursuant to Suiza's existing plan.

    - Suiza's stock option plan is administered by the Stock Option Committee of
      Suiza's board of directors. That committee is made up of only non-employee
      directors.

    - The plan does not have a fixed termination date. However, the Stock Option
      Committee may amend or discontinue the plan at any time subject to certain
      restrictions in the plan. Stockholder approval is required for some
      amendments, to the extent required by the Internal Revenue Code and stock
      exchange requirements. No amendment may adversely affect any previously
      granted option or restricted stock award, unless the holder of the award
      consents.

    - From time to time Suiza's Chief Executive Officer will recommend to the
      Stock Option Committee persons he believes should receive grants under the
      plan. The committee will consider, but need not accept, the Chief
      Executive Officer's recommendations.

    - The plan allows for grants of stock options (incentive or nonqualified)
      and restricted stock to certain directors, key employees and consultants
      of Suiza. Suiza currently has approximately 500 holders of options or
      restricted stock under the plan.

    - Each non-employee director, including members of the Stock Option
      Committee, automatically receives nonqualified options to purchase 7,500
      shares of common stock on June 30 of each year of his term. Those options
      are immediately exercisable and have an exercise price equal to the
      closing market price of Suiza's common stock on the date of the grant.

    - Suiza's non-employee directors may elect to receive their annual fee in
      shares of restricted stock rather than in cash. Shares issued as fees are
      issued under the plan. Suiza's officers and key employees are also
      eligible to receive grants of restricted stock. No more than       shares
      of restricted stock may be issued under the plan.

    - The plan was amended effective April 1, 1999 to prohibit re-pricing of
      options without approval of Suiza's stockholders. Suiza has never
      re-priced its stock options.

    - The Stock Option Committee decides the terms of all grants and awards
      under the plan. However, incentive stock options must comply with certain
      requirements imposed by the Internal Revenue Code, including that the
      exercise price may not be less than the fair market value of Suiza's
      common stock on the grant date, and the term may not exceed 10 years.

    - Option exercise prices may be paid in cash or, at Suiza's option, in
      shares of Suiza's common stock in which case the exercise must be
      completed in a brokered transaction.

    - If an option holder dies or becomes disabled, all of his or her vested
      options may be exercised any time within 1 year (or the remaining term of
      the option, if less). If a person ceases to be employed by Suiza for any
      reason, other than death or retirement, he or she must exercise any vested
      options within 60 days.

    - If an option holder retires, any unvested options held by such holder will
      automatically vest, if such person has reached the age of 65. Such vested
      options may be exercised at any time prior to the 10th anniversary of the
      grant date.

    - Shares subject to options or restricted stock grants that are cancelled or
      forfeited become immediately available for re-issuance.

    - The plan was adopted by Suiza's board of directors in February 1997 and
      approved by Suiza's stockholders in 1997. The number of shares reserved
      for issuance under the plan was increased in November 1997, May 1998,
      May 1999 and May 2000.

    In considering your vote, please remember that Suiza's officers and
directors are eligible for grants and awards under the plan. You should also
note that, if the merger occurs and Suiza's stockholders pass both option plan
proposals, a total of approximately             shares of Suiza common stock
will be available for issuance under all of Suiza's stock option and stock award
plans after the merger.

    See Annex H to this joint proxy statement/prospectus for tax information
about Suiza's stock option plan.

RECOMMENDATION OF SUIZA'S BOARD OF DIRECTORS

    Suiza's board of directors has adopted and unanimously approved both of the
option plan proposals, and recommends that Suiza's stockholders vote "FOR" both
of these proposals.

                               present.

    VOTING IN PERSON.  If you plan to attend a meeting and wish to vote in
person, we will give you a ballot at the meeting. However, if your shares are
held in the name of your broker or other nominee, you must obtain a proxy,
executed in your favor, from your broker to be able to vote at the meeting.

    BROKER NON-VOTES.  If your shares are held in an account at a broker or
bank, you must instruct the broker or bank on how to vote your shares. If you do
not instruct your broker on how to vote for you, your broker may turn in a
ballot for you that will count your shares as present for quorum purposes, but
your broker will not be entitled to vote on the proposals for you. If your
broker takes this action, it is called a "broker non-vote." If you are a Dean
stockholder and you do not instruct your broker on how to vote by marking your
vote in the broker's proxy form enclosed with this mailing, your failure to so
instruct your broker will have the same effect as a vote against the merger
agreement and the merger. If you are a Suiza stockholder and do not instruct
your broker on how to vote, your broker non-vote will not affect the outcome of
the vote on the merger proposal or the option plan proposal at Suiza's
stockholder meeting. Your broker will vote for you only if you provide
instructions on how to vote by marking your vote in the broker's proxy form
enclosed with this mailing.

    PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES.  We will provide reasonable assistance (including
audio enhancement) to help you participate in the stockholder meetings if you
tell us about your disability and your plan to attend Suiza's or Dean's
stockholder meeting. Please call or write Suiza Investor Relations or Dean's
Corporate Secretary in advance if you require these services or other special
accommodations at your stockholder meeting at the number or address under
"Summary Information--The Companies" on page 4.

PROXY SOLICITATION

    We will each pay our own costs of soliciting proxies.

    In addition to this mailing, our employees may solicit proxies personally,
electronically or by telephone. Suiza estimates that it will pay the firm of
Georgeson & Co. a fee of approximately $            plus expenses to help with
the solicitation. Dean estimates that it will also pay

Morrow & Co. a fee of approximately $            plus expenses to help with the
solicitation. The extent to which these proxy soliciting efforts will be
necessary depends entirely upon how promptly proxies are submitted. You should
submit your proxy without delay. We also reimburse brokers and other nominees
for their expenses in sending these materials to you and getting your voting
instructions.

    Do not send in any stock certificates with your proxy cards. Suiza will mail
transmittal forms with instructions for the surrender of Dean common stock as
soon as practicable after the completion of the merger.

corporation (the "Company").

    WHEREAS, the Company, upon the terms and subject to the conditions of this
Agreement and in accordance with the Delaware General Corporation Law ("Delaware
Law"), will merge with and into Merger Sub (the "Merger"), and pursuant thereto,
the issued and outstanding shares of common stock, $1.00 par value per share, of
the Company (the "Company Common Stock") will be converted into the right to
receive the merger consideration set forth herein;

    WHEREAS, the Board of Directors of the Company has determined that the
Merger is advisable, fair to, and in the best interests of, the Company and its
stockholders and has approved and adopted this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby;

    WHEREAS, the Board of Directors of Parent has determined that the Merger is
advisable, fair to, and in the best interests of, Parent and its stockholders
and has approved and adopted this Agreement and the transactions contemplated
hereby;

    WHEREAS, the Board of Directors of Merger Sub has approved and adopted this
Agreement and Parent, as the sole stockholder of Merger Sub, will adopt this
Agreement promptly after the execution hereof by the parties hereto;

    WHEREAS, for federal income tax purposes, it is intended that the Merger

amended (the "Code"); and

    NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the respective
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements set forth in this
Agreement, the parties hereto agree as follows:

                                   ARTICLE I

                                   THE MERGER

    SECTION 1.01. THE MERGER. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set
forth in this Agreement (including SECTION 2.01(B)), and in accordance with
Delaware Law, at the Effective Time (as defined in SECTION 1.02), the Company

this Agreement (the "Closing") will take place at the offices of Hughes & Luce,
L.L.P., 1717 Main Street, Dallas, Texas as soon as practicable (but in any event
within two business days) after the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set
forth in ARTICLE VII, or at such other date, time and place as Parent and the
Company may agree; provided, that the conditions set forth in ARTICLE VII shall
have been satisfied or waived at or prior to such time. The date on which the
Closing takes place is referred to herein as the "Closing Date." As promptly as
practicable on the Closing Date, the parties hereto will cause the Merger to be
consummated by filing a certificate of merger with the Secretary of State of the
State of Delaware, in such form as required by, and executed in accordance with,
the relevant provisions of Delaware Law (the date and time of such filing, or
such later date or time agreed upon by Parent and the Company and set forth
therein, being the "Effective Time").

                                      A-5

    SECTION 1.03. EFFECT OF THE MERGER. At the Effective Time, the effect of the
Merger will be as provided in the applicable provisions of Delaware Law. Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, and subject thereto, at the Effective
Time, all the properties, rights, privileges and powers of the Company and
Merger Sub will vest in the Surviving Corporation, and all debts, liabilities
and duties of the Company and the Merger Sub will become the debts, liabilities
and duties of the Surviving Corporation.

    SECTION 1.04. CERTIFICATE OF INCORPORATION; BYLAWS. At the Effective Time,
the certificate of incorporation of Merger Sub, as in effect immediately prior
to the Effective Time, will be the certificate of incorporation of the Surviving
Corporation and thereafter will continue to be its certificate of incorporation
until amended as provided therein and pursuant to Delaware Law. The bylaws of
Merger Sub, as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, will be the
bylaws of the Surviving Corporation and thereafter will continue to be its
bylaws until amended as provided therein and pursuant to Delaware Law.

    SECTION 1.05. DIRECTORS AND OFFICERS. The directors of Merger Sub will be
the directors of the Surviving Corporation at the Effective Time, each to hold
office in accordance with the charter and bylaws of the Surviving Corporation,
in each case until their respective successors are duly elected or appointed and
qualified. The officers of Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time
will be the officers of the Surviving Corporation at the Effective Time, each to
hold office in accordance with the bylaws of the Surviving Corporation, in each
case until their respective successors are duly elected or appointed and
qualified.

                                   ARTICLE II

               CONVERSION OF SECURITIES; EXCHANGE OF CERTIFICATES

    SECTION 2.01. MERGER CONSIDERATION; CONVERSION AND CANCELLATION OF
SECURITIES. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any
action on the part of the Parent and Merger Sub, the Company or their respective
stockholders:

        (a) Subject to the other provisions of this ARTICLE II, each share of
    Company Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
    Effective Time (excluding any Company Common Stock described in
    SECTION 2.01(D)) will be converted into the right to receive (i) $21.00 in
    cash (as may be adjusted in accordance with SECTION 2.01(B), the "Cash
    Consideration") and (ii) 0.429 (as may be adjusted in accordance with
    SECTION 2.01(B), the "Exchange Ratio") shares of common stock, $.01 par
    value per share, of Parent ("Parent Common Stock") (such Cash Consideration
    and Parent Common Stock collectively, the "Per Share Merger Consideration").

        (b) If on the day upon which the Effective Time occurs (or if no trading
    of Parent Common Stock on the New York Stock Exchange (the "NYSE") takes
    place prior to the Effective Time on such day, the last date prior to the
    date upon which the Effective Time occurs upon which there was trading of
    Parent Common Stock on the NYSE), the fair market value, based on the volume
    weighted average per share sales price of the Parent Common Stock on that
    day on the NYSE ("Parent Common Stock Closing Price"), of all shares of
    Parent Common Stock to be delivered in connection with the Merger, minus the
    product of (x) the Parent Common Stock Closing Price and (y) 20,000 (the
    "Total Stock Value") would be (but for adjustments made pursuant to this
    SECTION 1.01(B)) less than 40% of the sum of (i) the number of the Converted
    Shares (as defined in SECTION 2.01(E)) multiplied by the Cash Consideration,
    (ii) the amount of cash paid by Parent and/or any of its subsidiaries to
    acquire shares of Company Common Stock within the two year period prior to
    the date of the Merger, (iii) the Total Stock Value, (iv) the number of
    Dissenting Shares, multiplied by the sum of (A) the Cash Consideration and
    (B) the product of the Exchange Ratio (prior to any adjustment) and the
    Parent Common Stock Closing Price, and (v) the product of (x) the Parent
    Common Stock Closing Price and (y) 20,000 (such sum being referred to as the

                                      A-6

    "Total Merger Consideration") then the Exchange Ratio and the Cash
    Consideration shall be adjusted as follows: The adjusted Exchange Ratio
    shall be equal to (i) the sum of (A) 40% of the dollar amount of the Total
    Merger Consideration determined as provided in the preceding sentence and
    (B) the product of (x) the Parent Common Stock Closing Price and
    (y) 20,000, divided by (ii) the product of (A) the number of Converted
    Shares and (B) the Parent Common Stock Closing Price, and the adjusted Cash
    Consideration shall be equal to (i) 60% of the dollar amount of the Total
    Merger Consideration as determined above, minus the sum of (A) the amount of
    cash paid by Parent and/or any of its subsidiaries to acquire shares of
    Company Common Stock within the two year period prior to the date of the
    Merger, (B) the number of Dissenting Shares, multiplied by the sum of
    (x) the Cash Consideration (prior to any adjustment) and (y) the product of
    the Exchange Ratio (prior to any adjustment) and the Parent Common Stock
    Closing Price, and (C) the product of (x) the Parent Common Stock Closing
    Price and (y) 20,000, divided by (ii) the number of Converted Shares.

        (c) Notwithstanding the foregoing subsection (a), if between the date of
    this Agreement and the Effective Time, the outstanding shares of Parent
    Common Stock or Company Common Stock will have been changed into a different
    number of shares by reason of any dividend payable in stock, split,
    combination or similar event, the Per Share Merger Consideration will be
    correspondingly adjusted to reflect such stock dividend, split, combination
    or similar event.

        (d) Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary,
    (i) each share of Company Common Stock held in the treasury of the Company
    or owned by any subsidiary of the Company, and each share of Company Common
    Stock owned by Parent, Merger Sub or any other subsidiary of Parent
    immediately prior to the Effective Time will be canceled and extinguished
    without any conversion thereof and no payment shall be made with respect
    thereto, and (ii) each share of Company Common Stock that is issued and
    outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and that is held by a
    stockholder who has properly exercised appraisal rights with respect thereto
    in accordance with Section 262 of Delaware Law (the "Dissenting Shares"),
    will not be converted into or be exchangeable for the right to receive the
    Per Share Merger Consideration, and such stockholder will be entitled to
    receive payment of the appraised value of each such share in accordance with
    the provisions of Section 262 of Delaware Law unless and until such
    stockholder fails to perfect or will have effectively waived, withdrawn or
    lost its rights to appraisal and payment in accordance with Delaware Law.
    If, after the Effective Time, any stockholder holding Dissenting Shares
    fails to perfect or shall have effectively waived, withdrawn or lost such
    appraisal right, such shares of Company Common Stock will thereupon be
    treated as if they had been converted into and to have become exchangeable
    for, at the Effective Time, the right to receive the Per Share Merger
    Consideration to which such stockholder is entitled, without any interest
    thereon. The Company will give Parent prompt notice of any demands received
    by the Company for appraisal of shares of Company Common Stock and, prior to
    the Effective Time, Parent will have the right to participate in all
    negotiations and proceedings with respect to such demands. Prior to the
    Effective Time, the Company will not, except with the prior written consent
    of Parent, make any payment with respect to, or settle or offer to settle,
    any such demands or agree to do any of the foregoing.

        (e) All shares of Company Common Stock shall cease to be outstanding and
    will automatically be canceled and retired, and each certificate previously
    evidencing Company Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the
    Effective Time (other than Company Common Stock described in
    SECTION 2.01(D)) (the "Converted Shares") will thereafter represent the
    right to receive, subject to SECTION 2.03(C), that number of shares of
    Parent Common Stock and the Cash Consideration determined pursuant to
    SECTION 2.01(A) (the "Merger Consideration") and, if applicable, cash
    pursuant to SECTION 2.03(C). The owners of certificates previously
    evidencing Converted Shares will cease to have any rights with respect to
    such Converted Shares except as otherwise provided herein or by law. Such
    certificates previously evidencing Converted Shares will

                                      A-7

    be exchanged for certificates evidencing whole shares of Parent Common Stock
    upon the surrender of such certificates in accordance with the provisions of
    SECTION 2.03, without interest. No fractional shares of Parent Common Stock
    will be issued in connection with the Merger and, in lieu thereof, a cash
    payment shall be made pursuant to SECTION 2.03(C).

        (f) Each share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of Merger Sub
    issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time will be
    converted into one share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the
    Surviving Corporation.

    SECTION 2.02. TREATMENT OF STOCK OPTIONS AND OTHER EQUITY-BASED AWARDS.

    (a) Each outstanding option to purchase, stock appreciation right, phantom
stock award, or performance share award (other than performance share awards
which are generally payable in cash) relating to Company Common Stock
(collectively, a "Company Common Stock Award") granted prior to the Effective
Time and which remains outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time will
cease to represent a right to acquire shares of Company Common Stock and will be
converted (as so converted, a "Company Converted Stock Award"), at the Effective
Time, into an option to acquire, stock appreciation right, phantom stock award,
or performance share award (other than performance share awards which are
generally payable in cash) relating to, as applicable, on the same terms and
conditions as were applicable under the Company Common Stock Award (but taking
into account any change thereto, including the acceleration thereof provided for
in the applicable Company stock option plan or in any award agreement by reason
of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby) that number of shares
of Parent Common Stock determined by multiplying (a) the number of shares of
Company Common Stock subject to such Company Common Stock Award by (b) the sum
of (i) the Exchange Ratio plus (ii) the Cash Consideration per share divided by
the closing price for a share of Parent Common Stock as reported on the NYSE on
the last trading day immediately preceding the Closing Date (such sum, the
"Stock Award Exchange Ratio") (rounded, if necessary, to the nearest whole share
of Parent Common Stock). The exercise price per share for each share of Parent
Common Stock subject to such Company Converted Stock Award will be equal to the
per share exercise price specified in the Company Common Stock Award divided by
the Stock Award Exchange Ratio (rounded to the nearest one-hundredth of a cent).
Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the case of any Company Common Stock Award to
which Section 421 of the Code applies by reason of its qualification under
Section 422 of the Code, the option price, the number of shares subject to such
option and the terms and conditions of exercise of such option will be
determined in a manner consistent with the requirements of Section 424(a) of the
Code. Performance share awards which are generally payable in cash, but which
permit the holder to elect receipt of shares (as provided in the applicable
grant agreement), shall be converted into a right to elect to receive new shares
of Parent Common Stock.

    (b) As soon as practicable after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause to
be included under a registration statement on Form S-8 of Parent all shares of
Parent Common Stock which are subject to Company Converted Stock Awards, and
shall maintain the effectiveness of such registration statement until all
Company Converted Stock Awards have been exercised, expired or forfeited.

    SECTION 2.03. EXCHANGE AND SURRENDER OF CERTIFICATES.

    (a) As soon as practicable after the Effective Time, each record holder of
certificates previously evidencing Converted Shares will be entitled to receive,
and Parent shall cause the Exchange Agent (as defined in
SECTION 2.03(E) below) to issue and pay, as applicable, to each such record
holder or to such persons as such holder may request upon surrender of such
certificates to the Exchange Agent, (i) a certificate or certificates
representing the number of whole shares of Parent Common Stock into which the
Converted Shares so surrendered will have been converted as aforesaid, in such
denominations and registered in such names as such holder may request, and
(ii) the Cash Consideration into which the Converted Shares so surrendered will
have been converted. If such holder would otherwise be entitled to fractional
shares of Parent Common Stock, such holder will upon surrender of the
certificates

                                      A-8

representing such shares held as aforesaid, be paid an amount in cash in
accordance with the provisions of SECTION 2.03(C). Until so surrendered and
exchanged, each certificate previously evidencing Converted Shares will
represent solely the right to receive the Merger Consideration and cash in lieu
of fractional shares. Unless and until any such certificates will be so
surrendered and exchanged, no dividends or other distributions payable to the
holders of record of Parent Common Stock as of any time on or after the
Effective Time will be paid to the holders of record of Converted Shares;
PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that Parent will deposit with the Exchange Agent any such
dividends or other distributions payable with respect to the Parent Common Stock
represented by any unsurrendered certificates evidencing Converted Shares, and
upon any such surrender and exchange of such certificates, Parent will cause the
Exchange Agent to pay to the holders of record of Converted Shares (i) the
amount, without interest thereon, of dividends and other distributions, if any,
with a record date on or after the Effective Time theretofore paid with respect
to such whole shares of Parent Common Stock, and (ii) at the appropriate payment
date, the amount of dividends or other distributions, if any, with a record date
on or after the Effective Time but prior to surrender and a payment date
occurring after surrender, payable with respect to such whole shares of Parent
Common Stock.

    (b) All shares of Parent Common Stock issued and all Cash Consideration paid
upon the surrender for exchange of certificates previously representing
Converted Shares in accordance with the terms hereof (including any cash paid
pursuant to SECTION 2.03(C)) will be deemed to have been issued in full
satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such Converted Shares. At and after the
Effective Time, there will be no further registration of transfers on the stock
transfer books of the Surviving Corporation of Company Common Stock that was
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective
Time, certificates that previously evidenced Converted Shares are presented to
the Surviving Corporation for any reason, they will be canceled and exchanged as
provided in this ARTICLE II.

    (c) No certificates or scrip evidencing fractional shares of Parent Common
Stock will be issued upon the surrender for exchange of certificates, and such
fractional share interests will not entitle the owner thereof to any rights of a
stockholder of Parent. In lieu of any such fractional shares, Parent will cause
the Exchange Agent to pay to the owner thereof, upon surrender of such
certificate for exchange pursuant to this ARTICLE II, an amount in cash (without
interest), rounded to the nearest cent, determined by multiplying (i) the
Closing Price by (ii) the
