                        SPECIAL MEETING OF STOCKHOLDERS

Dear Mediconsult Stockholder,

     The boards of directors of Andrx Corporation and Mediconsult.com, Inc.
have approved a merger agreement that will result in Mediconsult becoming a
wholly-owned subsidiary of Andrx Corporation. If the merger is completed, you
will receive shares of the class of Andrx Corporation common stock, which
tracks the Internet business of Andrx Corporation, known as the Cybear Group,
and is referred to as Cybear tracking stock, in exchange for your shares of
Mediconsult common stock. The Cybear Group, includes Andrx Corporation's Cybear
Inc. subsidiary and, upon completion of the merger, will include Mediconsult.
We expect that the merger will be tax-free to you and Andrx Corporation. The
boards of directors of Andrx Corporation and Mediconsult believe that the
merger should provide benefits to both Mediconsult and Andrx Corporation.

     Mediconsult stockholders will receive, in the aggregate and subject to
adjustment, 11,731,459 shares of Cybear tracking stock in the merger, or
approximately 42.9% of the issued and outstanding shares of Cybear tracking
stock following the merger. You will receive 0.1430 shares, subject to
adjustment, of Cybear tracking stock for each share of Mediconsult common stock
you own. Under the merger agreement, options and warrants to purchase
Mediconsult common stock that are outstanding immediately before the effective
time of the merger will be assumed by Andrx Corporation and converted into
options and warrants to purchase Cybear tracking stock at the rate of 0.1430
shares, subject to adjustment, of Cybear tracking stock for each share of
Mediconsult common stock into which your option or warrant is convertible. The
merger is subject to several conditions, including the restructuring of certain
obligations and the amendment of certain agreements of Mediconsult.

     The number of shares of Cybear tracking stock you will receive in the
merger is subject to adjustment. By adopting the merger agreement, Mediconsult
stockholders agree that 20% of the total number of shares of Cybear tracking
stock to be issued in the merger will not be issued until a balance sheet as of
the closing date of the merger is agreed upon by Andrx Corporation and
Mediconsult. Consequently, the exact number of shares of Cybear tracking stock
Mediconsult's stockholders will receive may be less than 11,731,459 but not
less than 9,385,723. We anticipate that immediately after the merger,
approximately 42.9% of the outstanding shares of Cybear tracking stock will be
held by former Mediconsult stockholders or noteholders. The exact percentage
will depend on the adjustment made, if any.

     Andrx Corporation and Mediconsult also entered into a credit agreement
which is more fully described herein.

     The board of directors of Mediconsult has unanimously approved the merger
and the merger agreement and determined that the merger is advisable, fair to
and in the best interests of Mediconsult and its stockholders. The merger
cannot be completed unless the Mediconsult stockholders adopt the merger
agreement by the vote of the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of
Mediconsult common stock. Whether or not you plan to attend the special
meeting, please take the time to vote by completing and mailing the enclosed
proxy card to us. If you attend the special meeting, you may vote in person
even if you previously returned your proxy. To adopt the merger agreement, you
MUST vote "FOR" the proposal by following the instructions stated on the
enclosed proxy card. If you do not vote at all, it will in effect count as a
vote against the proposal. We urge you to vote FOR the merger.

     Robert A. Jennings, a principal stockholder, and JHC Limited, an entity
controlled by Mr. Jennings, together representing 12,597,752 shares of
Mediconsult common stock or 22.6% of the outstanding shares of Mediconsult
common stock have already agreed to vote in favor of the merger.

     Please see pages 27 through 44 for a description of risk factors that may
affect the value of the Cybear tracking stock to be issued to you in the
merger, along with other risk factors pertaining to the merger that you should
consider.

     This document provides you with detailed information about the merger. We
encourage you to read this document carefully in its entirety.

                                        Sincerely yours,

                                        Ian D. Sutcliffe
                                        Chief Executive Officer
                                        Mediconsult.com, Inc.

Neither the Securities and Exchange Commission nor any state securities
commission has approved or disapproved of this transaction or the Cybear
tracking stock to be issued in the merger or determined if this proxy
statement/prospectus is accurate or adequate. Any representation to the
contrary is a criminal offense.

          This proxy statement/prospectus is dated February 13, 2001,
      and was first mailed to stockholders on or about February 13, 2001.

                             MEDICONSULT.COM, INC.

     In September 2000, Andrx Corporation reorganized and acquired the
outstanding shares of common stock of Cybear Inc. that it did not own,
reincorporated in Delaware and created two new classes of common stock:

   o Andrx common stock, to track the performance of the Andrx Group, which
      includes Andrx Corporation and subsidiaries, other than its Cybear Inc.
      subsidiary and certain potential future Internet businesses of Andrx
      Corporation; and

   o Cybear tracking stock, to track the performance of the Cybear Group,
      which includes Cybear Inc., its subsidiaries, certain potential future
      Internet businesses of Andrx Corporation, and upon completion of the
      merger will include Mediconsult.

     As used in this proxy statement/prospectus, "Andrx Corporation" refers to
Andrx Corporation and all of its subsidiaries. "Andrx" refers to Andrx
Corporation and all of its subsidiaries prior to the September 2000
reorganization and to Andrx and its subsidiaries, other than Cybear Inc. after
the reorganization. "Cybear" refers to Cybear Inc. and its subsidiaries prior
to and following the reorganization. "Mediconsult" refers to Mediconsult.com,
Inc. and its subsidiaries. "We" refers to Andrx Corporation and Mediconsult,
collectively.

     The information in this proxy statement/prospectus with respect to Andrx
Corporation gives effect to the two-for-one stock splits in June 1999 and April
2000 of the Andrx common stock.

                                      iii

                                    SUMMARY

     This summary contains selected information from this document and may not
contain all of the information that is important to you. To understand the
merger fully, we strongly encourage you to read this entire document carefully,
including the annexes, and the documents to which we refer. A list of documents
that Andrx Corporation incorporates by reference appears under the heading
"Where You Can Find More Information."

                                 The Companies

Andrx Corporation
4955 Orange Drive
Davie, Florida 33314
Telephone: (954) 584-0300

     Andrx formulates and commercializes controlled-release oral
pharmaceuticals using its proprietary drug delivery technologies. Andrx markets
and sells Cartia XT(R) and Diltia XT(R), its generic or bioequivalent versions
of Cardizem(R) CD and Dilacor XR(R).

     Andrx has eight proprietary drug delivery technologies that it has
patented for certain applications or for which it has filed for patent
protection for certain applications. Andrx believes its technologies are
flexible and can be modified to apply to a variety of pharmaceutical products.
Andrx uses its proprietary drug delivery technologies and formulation skills to
develop:

     o bioequivalent versions of selected controlled-release brand name
pharmaceuticals; and

   o brand name controlled-release formulations of existing immediate-release
     or controlled-release drugs where it believes that the application of
     Andrx's drug delivery technologies may improve the efficacy or other
     characteristics of those products.

     Controlled-release drug delivery technologies generally provide more
consistent and appropriate drug levels in the bloodstream than
immediate-release dosage forms and may improve drug efficacy and reduce side
effects by releasing drug dosages at specific times and in specific locations
in the body. These technologies also allow for the development of "patient
friendly" dosage forms, which reduce the number of times a drug must be taken,
thus improving patient compliance.

     Through its distribution operations, Andrx also sell drugs manufactured by
third parties primarily to independent pharmacies, pharmacy chains which do not
maintain their own central warehousing facilities and pharmacy buying groups.

     Cybear is an information technology company that is using the Internet to
improve the efficiency of clinical, administrative and communications tasks
associated with patient care from providers through the secure and reliable
transmission of this information.

Mediconsult.com, Inc.
560 White Plains Road
Tarrytown, New York 10591
Telephone: (914) 332-6100

     Mediconsult.com, Inc. is a provider of solutions using the Internet to
educate and connect doctors and patients. Mediconsult's websites and Internet
services educate physicians, educate chronic patients

and enable more effective doctor-patient relationships. Mediconsult provides
doctors and patients with access to relevant communities, reliable tools and
quality medical information that Mediconsult believes save doctors time and
improve health outcomes for their patients.

     Mediconsult's focus is on the chronic medical conditions that are the
cause of the majority of healthcare spending. By fostering communities of
physicians and patients centered on prevalent medical conditions and health
issues, Mediconsult believes that it creates significant opportunities for
pharmaceutical and other healthcare companies to effectively reach physician
and patient audiences using Internet-based medical education, marketing and
sponsorship programs.

The Merger (See page 52)

     The boards of directors of Andrx Corporation and Mediconsult approved a
merger agreement that will result in Mediconsult becoming part of Cybear. If
the merger is completed, you will receive shares of Cybear tracking stock in
exchange for your shares of Mediconsult common stock. We strongly encourage you
to read the merger agreement, attached as Annex A to this document, carefully
because it is the legal document that governs the merger.

     You will receive, in the aggregate and subject to adjustment,
approximately 11,731,459 shares of Cybear tracking stock in the merger, or
approximately 42.9% of the issued and outstanding shares of Cybear tracking
stock following the merger. You will receive 0.1430 shares, subject to
adjustment, of Cybear tracking stock for each share of Mediconsult common stock
you own. Under the merger agreement, options and warrants to purchase
Mediconsult common stock that are outstanding immediately before the effective
time of the merger will be assumed by Andrx Corporation and converted into
options and warrants to purchase Cybear tracking stock at the rate of 0.1430
shares, subject to adjustment, of Cybear tracking stock for each share of
Mediconsult common stock into which your option or warrant is convertible. The
merger is subject to several conditions, including the restructuring of certain
obligations and amendment of certain agreements of Mediconsult. The number of
shares of Cybear tracking stock Mediconsult's stockholders will receive is,
however, subject to adjustment. Therefore, the exact number of shares of Cybear
tracking stock Mediconsult stockholders will receive may be less than
11,731,459 but not less than 9,385,723.

     We anticipate that immediately after the merger, approximately 42.9% of
the outstanding shares of Cybear tracking stock will be held by former
Mediconsult stockholders and parties who will receive shares of Mediconsult
common stock prior to the merger in connection with the restructuring of
certain obligations and amendment of certain agreements. The exact percentage
will depend on the adjustment made, if any.

Risks Involved with the Merger (See page 27)

     An investment in Cybear tracking stock involves a high degree of risk. You
should carefully consider the risk factors set forth in the section entitled
"Risk Factors."

Special Meeting (See page 49)

Record Date; Voting Power

     If you are a Mediconsult stockholder, you are entitled to vote at the
special meeting if you owned shares of Mediconsult common stock as of the
record date for that special meeting, which was the close of business on
January 31, 2001.

     On the record date, there were 55,690,636 shares of Mediconsult common
stock outstanding. For each share of Mediconsult common stock owned on that
date, Mediconsult stockholders will have one vote at the special meeting.

Quorum; Required Vote of Mediconsult Common Stockholders

     The holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of Mediconsult common
stock must be present, in person or by proxy, at the special meeting for there
to be a quorum. The merger requires the approval by a majority of all of the
outstanding shares of Mediconsult common stock entitled to vote at the
Mediconsult special meeting. If you fail to vote or abstain from voting, it has
the effect of a vote against the merger. Robert A. Jennings, a principal
stockholder and director, and JHC Limited, an entity controlled by Mr.
Jennings, together representing 12,597,752 shares of Mediconsult common stock
or 22.6% of the outstanding shares of Mediconsult common stock, have already
agreed to vote in favor of the merger. As of January 31, 2001, Andrx
Corporation, its directors and executive officers, and their affiliates, held
no shares of Mediconsult common stock.

Share Ownership of Management and Directors

     On January 31, 2001, directors and executive officers of Mediconsult owned
and were entitled to vote 15,383,752 shares of Mediconsult common stock, or
approximately 27.2% of the Mediconsult common stock outstanding on that date.

Mediconsult's Reasons for the Merger (See page 52)

     At the meeting held by the Mediconsult board of directors on January 9,
2001, the Mediconsult board of directors, by a unanimous vote of all directors,
determined that the terms of the merger were advisable, fair to, and in the
best interests of, Mediconsult and its stockholders, approved the merger
agreement and authorized and directed certain executive officers to execute the
merger agreement on behalf of Mediconsult.

     Mediconsult executed the merger agreement on January 9, 2001 and issued a
press release announcing the merger agreement and the transactions contemplated
therein on January 10, 2001.

     Accordingly, the Mediconsult board of directors, having unanimously
approved the merger agreement and determined that the merger is advisable, fair
to, and in the best interests of, Mediconsult and its stockholders, recommends
that the Mediconsult stockholders vote FOR adoption of the merger agreement.

     The decision of the Mediconsult board of directors to approve the merger
agreement on January 9, 2001, followed several months of exploring and
analyzing the various strategic and financial alternatives available to
Mediconsult. During this period, the Mediconsult board of directors met
numerous times and reviewed in detail the business, results of operations and
prospects of Mediconsult.

     In making its recommendation to the Mediconsult stockholders with respect
to the merger, the Mediconsult board of directors considered a number of
factors. These factors, to which no relative weights have been assigned,
include the following:

     o The investigation and review by the Mediconsult board of directors of
the merger;

   o The knowledge and review by the Mediconsult board of directors and its
     advisors of the current business, assets and financial condition and
     future prospects of Mediconsult, including its working capital deficit;

   o The information provided to the Mediconsult board of directors by the
     officers of Mediconsult with respect to the financial terms and other
     aspects of the merger;

   o The presentation of McFarland Dewey & Co., LLC, Mediconsult's financial
     advisor, delivered to the Mediconsult board of directors at its meetings
     on January 4, 2001 and January 9, 2001,

     including McFarland Dewey's written opinion, dated January 9, 2001, that,
     as of such date, and based upon and subject to the assumptions,
     limitations and qualifications set forth in such opinion, the exchange
     ratio, including any adjustment, is fair to the Mediconsult stockholders
     from a financial point of view (see " -- Opinion of Mediconsult's
     Financial Advisor");

   o The review of the material terms and conditions of the merger as
     reflected in the merger agreement, including the amount and form of
     consideration;

   o The review of the material terms and conditions of the interim financing
     provided to Mediconsult by Cybear, including the amount of the principal,
     the interest rate, the maturity date, the fact that the loan would be
     evidenced by a note secured by the assets and common stock of Physicians'
     Online, Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of Mediconsult, as well as
     warrants to purchase shares of Mediconsult's common stock;

   o Alternatives to the merger, including a proposed strategic transaction
     with a third party other than Andrx Corporation, the risks of liquidation
     and other alternatives that are less attractive for Mediconsult
     stockholders;

   o The fact that the combined companies will be positioned to service the
     growing needs of the on-line healthcare industry and hope to expand upon
     their relationships with key clients and to attract additional client
     relationships by offering a complete range of on-line services;

   o The structure of the merger, which would permit holders of Mediconsult
     common stock (except for the holders of notes) to convert all of their
     shares of Mediconsult common stock on a tax-free basis; and

   o Such other matters as the Mediconsult board of directors deemed
     appropriate or necessary in considering the merger.

Opinion of McFarland Dewey (See page 53)

     An opinion was rendered to Mediconsult's board of directors by McFarland
Dewey, as to the fairness, from a financial point of view, of the exchange
ratio to the Mediconsult's stockholders in the merger. The Mediconsult board of
directors received an oral opinion on January 9, 2001, subsequently confirmed
in writing as of the same date, from McFarland Dewey to the effect that, as of
the date of the opinion and based upon and subject to the matters described in
the opinion, the exchange ratio is fair, from a financial point of view to the
holders of Mediconsult common stock. We have included this opinion as Annex B
to this document.

     The opinion is directed to the Mediconsult's board of directors and is not
a recommendation to stockholders with respect to any matter relating to the
merger. We urge you to read carefully the opinion in its entirety.

Recommendations to Stockholders (See page 58)

     The Mediconsult's board of directors believes that the merger is
advisable, fair to and in the best interests of Mediconsult and for its
stockholders and unanimously recommends that Mediconsult's stockholders vote
FOR the merger.

United States Federal Income Tax Considerations (See page 75)

     We believe that for U.S. federal income tax purposes, the Mediconsult
stockholders generally should not recognize any gain or loss as a result of the
merger, except with respect to cash received by the Mediconsult stockholders in
lieu of fractional shares of Cybear tracking stock and any cash paid to
dissenting stockholders.

     The U.S. federal income tax consequences are summarized below under the
heading "United States Federal Income Tax Considerations." Tax matters are very
complex and the tax consequences of the merger to you could depend on the facts
of your own situation. We urge you to consult your tax advisors for a full
description of the tax consequences of the merger to you.

Appraisal Rights (See page 87)

     Mediconsult is a Delaware corporation. If the Cybear tracking stock is not
listed for trading on the Nasdaq National Market on the effective date of the
merger, the Mediconsult stockholders will have the right to an appraisal of the
value of their shares of Mediconsult common stock, if any. If the Cybear
tracking stock is listed for trading on the Nasdaq National Market on the
effective date of the merger, the Mediconsult stockholders will have no
appraisal rights. Nasdaq has recently notified Andrx Corporation that the
Cybear tracking stock is not in compliance with the continued listing
requirements.

     If appraisal rights exist, any Mediconsult stockholder who does not wish
to receive the 0.1430 shares of Cybear tracking stock for each share of
Mediconsult common stock he, she or it holds in connection with the merger has
the right under Delaware law to have the "fair value" of his, her or its shares
determined by the Delaware Chancery Court. This "right of appraisal" is subject
to a number of restrictions and technical requirements. Generally, in order to
exercise appraisal rights:

     o you must not vote in favor of the merger; and

   o you must make a written demand for appraisal in compliance with Delaware
     law before the vote on the merger.

     Merely voting against the merger will not protect your right of appraisal.
Annex E to this proxy statement/prospectus contains the Delaware statutory
provision relating to your appraisal rights. Failure to follow all of the steps
required by this provision will result in the loss of your appraisal rights.
The Delaware law requirements for exercising appraisal rights are explained on
pages 87 to 90 of this proxy statement/prospectus.

Accounting Treatment (See page 91)

     The acquisition of the shares of Mediconsult common stock from the
Mediconsult stockholders will be accounted for by Andrx Corporation as a
purchase of a business. Under this method of accounting, the assets and
liabilities of Mediconsult acquired by Andrx Corporation will be recorded at
their fair value, and any excess of Andrx Corporation's purchase price over the
fair value will be accounted for as goodwill, which will be amortized over no
more than five years and allocated to Cybear.

Principal Provisions of the Merger Agreement (See page 78)

     The merger agreement contemplates the merger of a wholly-owned subsidiary
of Andrx Corporation with and into Mediconsult, with Mediconsult surviving the
merger. Upon the consummation of the merger, Mediconsult will become a
wholly-owned subsidiary of Andrx Corporation and part of Cybear. The merger
will become effective on the date and time that the certificate of merger is
filed with the Delaware Secretary of State or such other date and time
specified in the certificate of merger.

     The merger agreement contains representations and warranties by Andrx
Corporation, a wholly-owned subsidiary and Mediconsult which are customary for
agreements of this nature. The merger agreement also contains customary
covenants. Some of the covenants include:

   o Mediconsult's agreement to obtain an agreement from Robert A. Jennings, a
     director and principal stockholder of Mediconsult, and from JHC Limited,
     an entity controlled by Mr. Jennings, to vote in favor of the merger.

   o Andrx Corporation's agreement to cause Cybear Inc. to provide Mediconsult
     with up to $2,000,000 in interim financing to fund its operating
     activities until the consummation of the merger or termination of the
     merger agreement.

   o Mediconsult's agreement that it will not solicit, initiate or encourage
     or take any action which would facilitate a takeover proposal or engage in
     negotiations or disclose any nonpublic information or give access to its
     properties, books or records to any person who is considering making or
     has made a takeover proposal. Mediconsult may engage in negotiations,
     however, under certain conditions.

     The merger will be completed only if specific conditions are satisfied or
waived, including the restructuring of certain obligations and amendment of
certain agreements.

     The merger agreement can be terminated at any time before the merger is
completed. In certain circumstances, Mediconsult has agreed to pay Andrx
Corporation a termination fee of $1,000,000 and granted to Andrx Corporation a
breakup warrant to purchase up to 19.9% of Mediconsult's common stock as of the
termination date. The termination fee and the breakup warrant, along with the
nonsolicitation provisions, may discourage third parties who are interested in
acquiring a significant stake in Mediconsult, and these provisions are intended
by Andrx Corporation to increase the likelihood that the merger will be
completed.

Description of Andrx Corporation Capital Stock (See page 59)

     Andrx Corporation's capital structure consists of two classes of common
stock, Andrx common stock and Cybear tracking stock, and preferred stock. Andrx
Corporation's certificate of incorporation sets forth the details of this
capital structure and is attached as Annex C to this document. We strongly
encourage you to read the certificate of incorporation carefully in its
entirety because the certificate of incorporation governs your rights as a
holder of the Cybear tracking stock.

     The certificate of incorporation provides for the following rights and
preferences with respect to the two classes of Andrx Corporation common stock:

Voting Rights

   o On all matters as to which both classes of common stock vote together as
     a single class, each outstanding share of Andrx common stock will have one
     vote, and each outstanding share of Cybear tracking stock has a number of
     votes equal to the quotient of the average market value of a share of
     Cybear tracking stock divided by the average market value of a share of
     Andrx common stock during the 20 consecutive trading days ending on the
     tenth trading day prior to the record date for determination of the
     stockholders entitled to vote, subject to some exceptions and
     qualifications. Cybear tracking stock in no event may represent in excess
     of 25% of the total voting power of all outstanding shares of Andrx
     Corporation common stock.

Sale of Cybear

   o Upon a sale or other disposition by Andrx Corporation of all or
     substantially all of the properties and assets of Cybear, Andrx
     Corporation is required to pay a dividend on the outstanding shares of
     Cybear tracking stock, redeem some or all of the outstanding shares of
     Cybear tracking stock or convert outstanding shares of Cybear tracking
     stock into shares of Andrx common stock, subject to some exceptions more
     fully described in the description of the Andrx Corporation capital stock.

Optional Conversion

   o At any time after September 8, 2001, or the occurrence of tax-related
     events, the Andrx Corporation board of directors may convert shares of
     Cybear tracking stock into Andrx common stock at a specified ratio of
     market prices.

Dividends

   o Funds available for dividends on Andrx common stock and Cybear tracking
     stock are limited to the lesser of the amount that would be legally
     available for the payment of dividends on the stock of such group if the
     group were a separate company and an amount equal to the funds legally
     available for the payment of dividends for Andrx Corporation as a whole.

   o Subject to the prior payment of dividends on outstanding shares of
     preferred stock and the limitations described above, the Andrx Corporation
     board of directors may choose to declare and pay dividends on either
     class, or both classes, of common stock, in equal or unequal amounts.

Liquidation

   o In the event of a dissolution or liquidation and winding-up of Andrx
     Corporation after payment or provision for payment of the debts and other
     liabilities of Andrx Corporation and full preferential amounts to which
     holders of preferred stock are entitled, the holders of Andrx Corporation
     common stock and Cybear tracking stock will be entitled to receive the net
     assets, if any, of Andrx Corporation remaining for distribution on a per
     share basis in proportion to the specified liquidation units per share of
     each class, as more fully described herein. The liquidation rights of
     holders of the respective classes may not bear any relationship to the
     relative market values or relative voting rights of the two classes.

Comparative Per Share Market Price and Dividend Information (See page 47)

     Cybear tracking stock is quoted on the Nasdaq National Market under the
symbol "CYBA." Mediconsult common stock is quoted on the Nasdaq National Market
under the symbol "MCNS." On January 8, 2001, the last full trading day prior to
public announcement of the proposed merger, the closing price per share of
Cybear tracking stock was $0.2031 and the closing price per share of
Mediconsult common stock was $0.1562. On February 12, 2001, the most recent
practicable date prior to the filing of this document, the closing price per
share of Cybear tracking stock was $0.4375 and the closing price per share of
Mediconsult common stock was $0.0938.

     Andrx Corporation and Mediconsult have been notified by Nasdaq that the
Cybear tracking stock and Mediconsult common stock do not meet the requirements
for continued listing. Accordingly, both Cybear tracking stock and Mediconsult
common stock may be delisted from the Nasdaq National Market for failure to
meet the requirements for continued listing. See "Price Range of Common Stocks
and Dividend Information."

(1) Certain prior years' amounts have been reclassified to conform with the
    current year presentation.

(2) Net income attributed to Andrx common stock is based on the consolidated
    results of Andrx, including the majority ownership of Cybear though
    September 6, 2000 and the net income of Andrx excluding Andrx's 100%
    ownership of Cybear from September 7, 2000 to September 30, 2000.

(3) Cybear's net loss for the nine months ended September 30, 2000 reflects
    only the $5,299 of net loss attributable to the period subsequent to the
    reorganization (from September 7, 2000 to September 30, 2000).

(4) Cybear tracking stock is common stock of Andrx Corporation, but is designed
    to reflect the business of Cybear. Holders of Cybear tracking stock have
    no specific rights to the assets designated to Cybear, as Andrx
    Corporation continues to hold title to all of Cybear's assets and is
    responsible for all of its liabilities, regardless of how it allocates
    assets and liabilities among the classes of common stock for financial
    statement presentation purposes. Holders of Cybear tracking stock are
    therefore subject to the risks of investing in the business, assets and
    liabilities of Andrx Corporation as a whole. For instance, the assets
    allocated to each class of common stock are subject to Company-wide claims
    of creditors and stockholder litigation.

                      ANDRX CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES
           UNAUDITED PRO FORMA CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL DATA

     The unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated balance sheets as of
September 30, 2000 and the unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated
statements of operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2000 and for
the year ended December 31, 1999 give pro forma effect to:

   1. Andrx Corporation's reorganization which occurred on September 7, 2000.
     The reorganization created two classes of Andrx Corporation common stock:
     Cybear tracking stock, to separately track the performance of Cybear, and
     Andrx common stock, to track the performance of Andrx Corporation and its
     subsidiaries, other than its ownership of Cybear.

   2. The planned merger of Mediconsult with a wholly-owned subsidiary of
     Andrx Corporation. Upon completion of the merger, Mediconsult will be
     wholly-owned by Andrx Corporation and its results will be included in
     Cybear.

     Two sets of pro forma condensed consolidated financial data are being
presented: Andrx Corporation and Cybear. The unaudited pro forma condensed
consolidated balance sheets include the effects of the merger as if it occurred
as of September 30, 2000. Andrx Corporation's and Cybear's historical balance
sheets as of September 30, 2000 already include the effects of the
reorganization. The unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated statements of
operations give effect to the reorganization and the merger as if they had
occurred at the beginning of the periods presented.

     Andrx Corporation is presenting the consolidated financial information of
Cybear in these Cybear unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated financial
statements. Cybear tracking stock is common stock of Andrx Corporation, but is
designed to reflect the business of Cybear. Holders of Cybear tracking stock
have no specific rights to the assets designated to Cybear. Andrx Corporation
continues to hold title to all of Cybear's assets and is responsible for all of
its liabilities, regardless of how Andrx Corporation allocates assets and
liabilities among the classes of common stocks for financial statement
presentation purposes. Holders of Cybear tracking stock are, therefore, subject
to the risks of investing in the business, assets and liabilities of Andrx
Corporation as a whole. For instance, the assets allocated to each class of
common stock are subject to Company-wide claims of creditors and stockholder
litigation.

     The unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated financial data is provided
for informational purposes only and is not necessarily indicative of the
results of operations or financial position had the transactions assumed
therein occurred, nor is it necessarily indicative of the results of operations
that may be expected to occur in the future. Consummation of the merger is
subject to various conditions, including approval by stockholders of
Mediconsult. In addition to stockholder approval, the transaction will be
subject to other conditions, and accordingly, no assurance can be given that
this transaction will be consummated. Furthermore, the unaudited pro forma
condensed consolidated financial data is based upon assumptions that Andrx
Corporation believes are reasonable and should be read in conjunction with the
unaudited consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes thereto
included in Andrx Corporation's and Mediconsult's Quarterly Reports on Form
10-Q for the nine months ended September 30, 2000 and the consolidated
financial statements and accompanying notes thereto, included in Andrx
Corporation's, Cybear's and Mediconsult's Annual Reports on Form 10-K for the
year ended December 31, 1999.

            (in thousands, except for share and per share amounts)

(A) Goodwill resulting from the merger is derived as follows:

         Purchase price for Mediconsult ....................                    $5,756
         Historical net assets of Mediconsult
           at September 30, 2000 ...........................      (155,196)

                                                                  --------

         Restructuring charges .............................                     1,602
         Transaction costs .................................                     1,350
                                                                                ------
                                                                                $8,776
                                                                                ======

  $8,776 has been allocated to goodwill and amortized over an estimated life of
   five years. This results in annual amortization of $1,755. The final
   allocation of purchase price may differ materially from amounts assumed in
   the accompanying pro forma information. An increase or decrease of $0.10 in
   Cybear's common stock price will result in an increase or decrease of
   approximately $1,151 to annual goodwill and therefore in an increase or
   decrease of approximately $230 to annual goodwill amortization.

(B) Represents the elimination of historical Mediconsult goodwill and other
   intangibles of $157,599.

(C) Reflects $1,602 of restructuring charges in connection with the merger,
   consisting of severance costs of $925 and lease terminations and payouts of
   $677. As the effect of the restructuring is non-recurring, it has not been
   included in the unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated statements of
   operations.

(D) Reflects transaction costs of $1,350 incurred as a result of the merger.

(E) Reflects the conversion of $2,335 of notes payable plus accrued interest,
   into 26,227,000 shares of Mediconsult common stock prior to the closing of
   the merger.

(F) Reflects the $5,756 purchase price of Mediconsult allocated to goodwill,
   (approximately 11,512,000 shares of Cybear tracking stock), determined
   based on the exchange ratio of 0.1430 shares of Cybear tracking stock for
   each share of Mediconsult common stock pursuant to the merger agreement and
   an assumed Cybear tracking stock price of $0.50 per share.

(G) Includes intercompany transactions between Andrx and Cybear eliminated in
    historical Andrx Corporation financials which are shown in the respective
    group financial statements, as follows:

    Andrx Group--Prepaid and other current assets .........    $1,663

     attributable to the period subsequent to the reorganization (from
     September 7, 2000 to September 30, 2000). Andrx's historical earnings per
     share for the nine months ended September 30, 2000 includes its ownership
     for the period prior to the reorganization (from January 1, 2000 to
     September 6, 2000).

     granted to Mediconsult employees (as measured by SFAS 123) amounting to
     $1,536 for the nine months ended September 30, 2000 and $2,031 for the
     year ended December 31, 1999. Since Andrx Corporation uses APB 25 to
     account for stock options granted to employees, no compensation charges
     would have been recorded.

                                                                                  ======

     $8,776 has been allocated to goodwill and amortized over an estimated
      life of five years. This results in annual amortization of $1,755. The
      final allocation of purchase price may differ materially from amounts
      assumed in the accompanying pro forma information. An increase or
      decrease of $0.10 in Cybear's common stock price will result in an
      increase or decrease of approximately $1,151 to annual goodwill and
      therefore in an increase or decrease of approximately $230 to annual
      goodwill amortization.

     (B) Represents elimination of historical Mediconsult goodwill and other
 intangibles of $157,599.

   (C) Reflects $1,602 of restructuring charges in connection with the merger,
       consisting of severance costs of $925 and lease terminations and payouts
       of $677. As the effect of the restructuring is non-recurring, it has not
       been included in the unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated
       statements of operations.

     (D) Reflects transaction costs of $1,350 incurred as a result of the
       merger.

   (E) Reflects the conversion of $2,335 of notes payable plus accrued
       interest, into 26,227,000 shares of Mediconsult common stock prior to
       closing of the merger.

   (F) Reflects the $5,756 purchase price of Mediconsult allocated to
       goodwill, (approximately 11,512,000 shares of Cybear tracking stock),
       determined based on the exchange ratio (0.1430) of shares of Cybear
       tracking stock for each share of Mediconsult common stock pursuant to
       the merger agreement and an assumed Cybear tracking stock price of $0.50
       per share.

                                    CYBEAR
              NOTES TO UNAUDITED PRO FORMA CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED
                            STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS
        FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2000 AND THE YEAR ENDED
                               DECEMBER 31, 1999
             (in thousands, except for share and per share amounts)

   (1) For the nine months ended September 30, 2000, reflects the elimination
      of fees and expenses of $1,202 incurred by Cybear in connection with the
      reorganization. As the effect of the costs is non-recurring, they have
      been eliminated in the unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated
      statement of operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2000.

   (2) Reflects the additional amortization of reorganization goodwill of $696
      for the nine months ended September 30, 2000 and $1,045 for the year
      ended December 31, 1999. Such goodwill is amortized on a straight-line
      basis over an estimated life of ten years.

   (3) For the year ended December 31, 1999, reflects the elimination of
      Cybear's historical $2,824 income tax benefit which would not have been
      used by Cybear on a separate income tax return basis as required by the
      new tax sharing agreement between Cybear and Andrx pursuant to the
      reorganization.

   (4) Represents the reversal of compensation expense relating to options
      granted to Mediconsult employees (as measured by SFAS 123) amounting to
      $1,536 for the nine months ended September 30, 2000 and $2,031 for the
      year ended December 31, 1999. Since Cybear uses APB 25 to account for
      stock options granted to employees, no compensation expense would have
      been recorded.

   (5) Represents amortization of the Mediconsult goodwill resulting from the
      merger of $1,316 for the nine months ended September 30, 2000 and $1,755
      for the year ended December 31, 1999 and the elimination of historical
      goodwill amortization of $30,318 for the nine months ended September 30,
      2000 and $3,132 for the year ended December 31, 1999. (See Note A to the
      unaudited proforma condensed consolidated balance sheets.)

   (6) Represents the reversal of interest expense of $193 for the nine months
      ended September 30, 2000 and $43 for the year ended December 31, 1999
      relating to notes payable which were converted into Mediconsult common
      stock in connection with the merger.

                  UNAUDITED COMPARATIVE PER SHARE INFORMATION

     We present below per common share data regarding the income (loss), cash

(1) Mediconsult does not currently intend to pay dividends on its common stock
    and Andrx Corporation does not currently intend to pay dividends on its
    two classes of common stock.

(2) The Mediconsult per share equivalent pro forma data are calculated by
    multiplying the Cybear per share amounts by 0.1430, the exchange ratio for
    the Cybear tracking stock. The Cybear share equivalents remain unchanged,
    as the exchange ratio of Cybear tracking stock is one to one. The Andrx
    share equivalents remain unchanged as the Mediconsult merger is allocated
    only to the Cybear business unit.

                                 RISK FACTORS

     In addition to the other information included and incorporated by
reference in this proxy statement/prospectus, you should carefully consider the
following risk factors relating to the merger before you decide whether to vote
to approve and adopt the merger agreement.

Risks Related to the Merger

     Mediconsult stockholders may never receive 20% of the shares of Cybear
tracking stock to be issued in the merger.

     Twenty percent of the shares of Cybear tracking stock that would otherwise
be received by the Mediconsult stockholders in the merger may be subject to an
adjustment. Andrx Corporation may adjust the number of shares of Cybear
tracking stock each Mediconsult stockholder will receive by an agreed upon
number if the closing date audited balance sheet varies from the Mediconsult
stockholders' equity amount represented in the merger agreement. The closing
date balance sheet is to be audited by Andrx Corporation's independent
certified public accountants. Therefore, the Mediconsult stockholders may never
receive 20% of the shares of Cybear tracking stock to be issued in the merger
or may receive less than the full 20% if there is an adjustment.

     Tax-free treatment of the merger.

     Although the merger is intended to qualify as a tax-free reorganization
for federal income tax purposes, there can be no assurance that the IRS will
treat the merger as a tax-free reorganization within the meaning of Section 368
of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or the Code. If the IRS were
to successfully challenge the federal income tax treatment of the merger
discussed herein, each Mediconsult stockholder would be required to recognize
taxable gain or loss with respect to the Mediconsult common stock surrendered
in the merger.

     Cybear may face challenges in integrating Mediconsult's business into
Cybear and, as a result, may not realize the expected benefits of the
anticipated merger.

     Integrating the operations and personnel of Cybear and Mediconsult will be
a complex process, and Cybear is uncertain that the integration will be
completed rapidly or that it will achieve the anticipated benefits of the
merger. The successful integration of the businesses of the two companies will
require, among other things, integration of the sales and marketing groups and
coordination of development efforts, systems and technology. The diversion of
the attention of management and any difficulties encountered in the process of
combining the businesses of the two companies could cause the disruption of, or
a loss of momentum in, the activities of the combined business. Further, the
process of combining the two businesses of the companies could negatively
affect employee morale and the ability of the combined business to retain some
of its key employees after the merger. The inability to successfully integrate
the operations and personnel of Cybear and Mediconsult, or any significant
delay in achieving integration, could have a material adverse effect on the
business, financial condition and operating results of the combined business
after the merger.

Risks Related to Cybear

     Cybear has a limited operating history and a history of net losses and
there is no assurance that Cybear will report net income in the future.

     A potential investor in Cybear tracking stock should consider the risks,
expenses and difficulties frequently encountered by businesses such as Cybear,
particularly in the new and rapidly evolving market for Internet products,
content and services. There can be no assurance that Cybear will be successful
in addressing these risks. Since its inception, Cybear has been primarily
engaged in product development activities. Cybear has not yet generated any
significant revenues from product sales or any other services. In addition,
Cybear has incurred significant net losses and negative cash flow from
operations since inception.

     Cybear is still in an early stage and may experience difficulties in
developing and commercializing its products.

     Cybear faces all of the risks, uncertainties, expenses, delays, problems
and difficulties typically encountered in establishing a new business and
developing and commercializing new products. Cybear has limited experience in
developing and commercializing software and Internet-based products. It does
not know the potential performance or market acceptance of products that it may
introduce. It is possible that Cybear will have unanticipated expenses,
problems or technical difficulties that could cause material delays in product
commercialization.

     Cybear's operating losses have increased in recent quarters. Cybear
intends to continue to spend in the areas of product development, network
operations, sales and marketing, customer support and administration. As a
result, it expects to continue to incur substantial operating losses for the
foreseeable future, and it may not achieve or sustain profitability.

     Cybear will need to gain market acceptance in order to generate meaningful
revenues and become profitable.

     Cybear cannot be certain that it can achieve sufficient revenues in
relation to its expenses to ever become profitable. Cybear will not generate
any meaningful revenues until and unless its products gain market acceptance by
physicians and other participants in the healthcare industry. Cybear cannot
guarantee that physicians and other participants in the healthcare industry
will accept its products, or even the Internet, as a replacement for
traditional methods of communication and as a source of information and
administrative services. Market acceptance of its products will depend upon
continued growth in the use of the Internet generally and, in particular, as a
source of communications, information and administrative services for the
healthcare industry.

     Cybear anticipates its revenues to be generated primarily from:

     o e-commerce sales of products ordered through the Internet under an
   arrangement with Andrx;

     o transaction fees derived from the use of productivity applications by
   healthcare providers;

     o web developing and hosting fees; and

     o subscriber fees from the users of its products.

     Cybear's revenues to date have been primarily generated from the sale of
products pursuant to an arrangement with Andrx. The Southeast Regional office
of the SEC has commenced a formal private investigation of Cybear, primarily
focusing on Cybear's revenue reporting and internal controls with respect to
Cybearclub LC, the joint venture between Cybear and Andrx intended to promote
the distribution of certain healthcare products through the Internet. Andrx and
Cybear are cooperating voluntarily with the SEC.

     Cybear's business model is still evolving and it is unable to predict the
amount and timing of revenues. If Cybear does achieve profitability, it cannot
be certain that it can sustain or increase profitability on a quarterly or
annual basis in the future.

     Andrx Corporation has recently been notified that the Cybear tracking
stock may be delisted from the Nasdaq National Market, which could cause the
Cybear tracking stock price to fall and decrease the liquidity of the Cybear
tracking stock.

     The Nasdaq Stock Market, Inc. recently notified Andrx Corporation that the
Cybear tracking stock is not in compliance with the continued listing
requirements of the Nasdaq National Market because the Cybear tracking stock
failed to maintain a bid price of $1.00 for a minimum of 30 consecutive trading
days. Unless Cybear tracking stock is in compliance with the minimum bid price
requirement on or prior to February 21, 2001 (subject to certain exclusions for
appeal), the Cybear

tracking stock will be delisted from the Nasdaq National Market and will likely
trade in the over-the-counter market on the OTC Electronic Bulletin Board or
through the "pink sheets." In such event, a stockholder may find it more
difficult to obtain a price quotation for or sell Cybear tracking stock.
Therefore, delisting of the Cybear tracking stock from the Nasdaq National
Market may have an adverse impact on the market price and liquidity of the
Cybear tracking stock.

     The trading price of the Cybear tracking stock has been less than $5.00
per share since it was issued, and therefore, upon delisting from the Nasdaq
National Market, Cybear tracking stock will come within the definition of a
"penny stock." In such event, Cybear tracking stock will be subject to the
penny stock rules and regulations which require additional disclosure by
broker-dealers in connection with any trades involving a penny stock. The
additional burdens imposed on broker-dealers may restrict the ability of
broker-dealers to sell Cybear tracking stock and may affect a stockholder's
ability to resell Cybear tracking stock.

     Cybear may need additional capital to continue its business.

     Cybear believes that its existing capital resources may be sufficient to
enable it to meet its anticipated working capital and capital expenditure
requirements for the balance of 2001. Cybear expects negative cash flows and
net losses to continue for the foreseeable future. As a result, Cybear may need
to raise additional capital through public or private debt or equity financing
or through funding from Andrx Corporation, and has no agreements or
arrangements with respect to raising that capital with Andrx Corporation or any
other party. Additional funding, whether obtained through public or private
debt or equity financing, may not be available when required or may not be
available on terms favorable to Cybear, if at all. If additional financing is
not available, Cybear may be required to delay, scale back or eliminate some or
all of its product development and deployment programs.

     The market price of Cybear tracking stock may fluctuate widely.

     The market price of the Cybear tracking stock may fluctuate widely in
response to a number of events and factors such as:

     o quarterly changes in results of operations of Cybear;

   o announcements of new technological innovations and new products and
      properties by Cybear or its competitors;

     o changes in financial estimates and recommendations by securities
      analysts;

   o the operating and stock price performance of companies that investors may
      deem comparable to Cybear;

   o the board of directors of Andrx Corporation making determinations
      relating to a variety of cash management and allocation matters;

     o the variable voting power of Cybear tracking stock relative to Andrx
      common stock;

     o news relating to trends in Cybear's markets; and

     o general economic conditions.

     The stock market and specifically the stock of Internet companies have
been very volatile. This volatility is often not related to the operating
performance of the companies. This broad market volatility and industry
volatility may reduce the price of Cybear tracking stock, without regard to
Cybear's performance. In addition, Cybear's operating results may be below the
expectations of public market analysts and investors. In such event, there
would be a high possibility that the market price of Cybear tracking stock
would decrease.

     Cybear will not be able to attract users if it fails to establish and
maintain awareness of its products.

     In order to increase its user base, Cybear must establish, maintain and
strengthen the awareness of its products. For it to be successful in
establishing this awareness, healthcare providers must perceive Cybear products
as offering quality, cost-effective information and services, and medical
suppliers, pharmaceutical companies and other vendors to the healthcare
industry must perceive its products as being an effective marketing and sales
channel for their products and services. Cybear's business could be materially
adversely affected if its marketing efforts are not productive.

     Cybear needs to continue product development in order to attract and
retain users.

     If Cybear is unable to develop its products as planned, it will not be
able to attract and retain users, which will impact its ability to generate
revenue.

     Cybear's first product dr.cybear was introduced in March 1999 but still
needs further development. Other Cybear products have not yet been introduced
and are still under development. Cybear will have to commit considerable time,
effort and resources to finalize development and adapt its software to satisfy
specific requirements of potential customers. Cybear product development
efforts may not be successfully completed on a timely basis or at all. Cybear
may not be able to successfully adapt its software to satisfy specific
requirements of potential customers, and Cybear cannot guarantee that
unanticipated events will not occur which would result in increased costs or
material delays in product development or commercialization.

     Technologies as complex as those incorporated into its products may
contain errors that become apparent during commercial use. Remedying product
errors could delay its plans and cause Cybear to incur substantial additional
costs.

     Competition could hamper Cybear's ability to build its user base resulting
in insufficient revenues, which would adversely affect its business.

     Both the ISP market and the ASP market are extremely competitive. Cybear's
competitors include online services or websites targeted to the healthcare
community, general purpose ISPs, publishers and distributors of offline media
targeted to the healthcare community, healthcare information companies and
large data processing and information companies. Any pricing pressures, reduced
margins or loss of market share resulting from its failure to compete
effectively would materially adversely affect its business, financial condition
and operating results. Cybear may not have the financial resources, technical
expertise or marketing and support capabilities to compete successfully.

     Cybear expects competition in its market to increase significantly as new
companies enter the market and current competitors expand their product lines
and services. Many of these potential competitors are likely to enjoy
substantial competitive advantages, including:

   o greater financial, technical and marketing resources that can be devoted
      to the development, promotion and sale of their services;

     o stronger strategic relationships;

     o longer operating histories;

     o greater name recognition; and

     o larger user bases.

     Cybear will not be successful if Internet usage for business and
e-commerce does not increase.

     Cybear's success depends on the increased acceptance and use of the
Internet, which is uncertain. Internet usage in Cybear's business area is at an
early stage of development and is rapidly evolving. The adoption of the
Internet for commerce, particularly by those individuals and companies in the
healthcare industry that historically have relied upon traditional means of
commerce, will require a broad acceptance of new methods of conducting business
and exchanging information. A market for its products and services may not
develop and demand for its services may not emerge or be sustainable. If the
market fails to develop, develops more slowly than expected or becomes
saturated with competitors, or if its services do not achieve or sustain market
acceptance, its business, results of operations and financial condition would
be materially adversely affected.

     Internet usage may be inhibited for a number of reasons, such as:

     o lack of appropriate infrastructure;

     o limitations on access by potential users;

     o security concerns;

     o privacy concerns;

     o inconsistent quality of service; and

     o lack of availability of cost-effective, high-speed service.

     If Internet usage grows, the Internet infrastructure may not be able to
support the demands placed on it by this growth, and performance and
reliability may decline. In addition, websites may from time to time experience
interruptions in their service as a result of outages and other delays
occurring throughout the Internet network infrastructure. If these outages or
delays frequently occur in the future, Internet usage could be adversely
affected and users may not use Cybear's products and services.

     Breaches of Internet security could harm Cybear's business and result in
liability.

     To the extent that Cybear's activities involve the storage and
transmission of proprietary information such as patient information and credit
card numbers, security breaches could expose it to a risk of loss, litigation
and possible liability to users. Cybear's security measures may not prevent
security breaches, which in turn, may have a material adverse effect on its
business, results of operations and financial condition.

     A party who is able to circumvent Cybear's security measures could
misappropriate proprietary and confidential information or cause interruptions
in its operations. Cybear may be required to expend significant capital and
other resources to protect against the threat of security breaches or to
alleviate problems caused by breaches. Concerns over the security of Internet
transactions and the privacy of users may also inhibit the growth of the
Internet generally, especially as a means of conducting commercial
transactions.

     Claims that may be made against Cybear for information retrieved from the
Internet could have material adverse financial effects on its business.

     Due to the fact that materials may be downloaded from Cybear's products
and may be subsequently distributed to others, there is the potential that
claims will be made against Cybear for defamation, negligence, copyright or
trademark infringement or other theories based on the nature and content of
such materials. Similar claims have been brought, sometimes successfully,
against ISPs

in the past. In addition, Cybear could be subject to liability with respect to
content that may be accessible through its products or third party websites
linked from its products.

     Although Andrx Corporation carries general liability insurance for Cybear,
Andrx Corporation's insurance may not cover potential claims of this type or
may not be adequate to cover all costs incurred in defense of potential claims
or to indemnify it for all liability that may be imposed. Any costs or
imposition of liability that is not covered by insurance or in excess of
insurance coverage could have a material adverse effect on Cybear's business,
results of operations and financial condition.

     Cybear and its service and content providers may experience system
failures that could interrupt its services.

     The success of Cybear's business will depend on the capacity, reliability
and security of its network infrastructure. Cybear relies on major
telecommunications providers to provide the external telecommunications
infrastructure necessary for Internet communications. Cybear also depends on
its content and service providers for some of the content and service
applications that it makes available through dr.cybear. Any significant
interruptions in Cybear's services or an increase in response time could result
in a loss of potential or existing users and sponsors and, if sustained or
repeated, could reduce the attractiveness of dr.cybear to them. Although Cybear
maintains insurance for its business, it cannot guarantee that its insurance
will be adequate to compensate it for all losses that may occur or to provide
for costs associated with business interruptions.

     To succeed, Cybear must be able to operate dr.cybear 24 hours a day, seven
days a week, without interruption. To operate without interruption, Cybear's
service and content providers must guard against:

     o damage from fire, power loss and other natural disasters;

     o communications failures;

     o software and hardware errors, failures or crashes;

     o security breaches, computer viruses and similar disruptive problems; and

     o other potential interruptions.

     dr.cybear may be required to accommodate a high volume of traffic and
deliver frequently updated information. Cybear's users may experience slower
response times or system failures due to increased traffic on its site or for a
variety of other reasons. Cybear also depends on service application providers
to provide information and data feeds on a timely basis. dr.cybear could
experience disruptions or interruptions in service due to the failure or delay
in the transmission or receipt of this information. Any significant
interruption in Cybear's operations could have a material adverse effect on its
business, financial condition and operating results.

     If Cybear is unable to manage growth, its business may suffer.

     Cybear's inability to manage growth effectively would have a material
adverse effect on its business, financial condition and operating results.
Cybear must continue to implement and improve its operational, financial and
information systems, and expand, train and manage its employee base. Cybear may
not be able to effectively manage expansion of its operations, and its
facilities, systems, procedures or controls may not be adequate to support its
operations.

     Cybear's ability to implement its business plan depends on its ability to
attract and retain key personnel to implement its business plan.

     Cybear needs to attract and retain highly qualified technical, sales,
customer service and managerial personnel in order to implement its business
plan. Cybear particularly needs these personnel to continue product development
and marketing. Competition for personnel in these areas is intense, and Cybear
cannot guarantee that it will be able to attract or retain a sufficient number
of highly qualified employees in the future. If Cybear is unable to hire and
retain personnel in key positions, its business, financial condition and
operating results could be materially adversely affected.

     Cybear's inability to protect its intellectual property could adversely
impact the acceptance of the dr.cybear product and its financial condition.

     Cybear regards its patents, copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets
including methodologies, practices and tools and other intellectual property
rights as critical to its success. To protect Cybear's rights in these various
forms of intellectual property, it relies on a combination of patent, trademark
and copyright law, trade secret protection and confidentiality agreements and
other contractual arrangements with its employees, affiliates, clients,
strategic partners, acquisition targets and others. Cybear's inability to
protect its intellectual property adequately could have a material adverse
effect on the acceptance of the dr.cybear brand and on its business, financial
condition and operating results.

     Cybear cannot guarantee that its actions to protect its proprietary rights
will be adequate, that third parties will not infringe or misappropriate
intellectual property, or that it will be able to detect unauthorized use of
its intellectual property and take appropriate steps to enforce its rights. It
is possible that Cybear's competitors or others will adopt product or service
names similar to its, thereby impeding its ability to build brand identity and
possibly leading to customer confusion. Moreover, because domain names derive
value from the individual's ability to remember these names, Cybear cannot
guarantee that its domain name will not lose its value if, for example, users
begin to rely on mechanisms other than domain names to access online resources.
In addition, Cybear cannot guarantee that other parties will not assert
infringement claims against it.

     Litigation, whether to enforce or defend Cybear's intellectual property
rights, would divert management resources, be expensive and may not effectively
enable it to protect its intellectual property.

     Cybear's growth might be limited if its Internet activities become subject
to sales or other taxes.

     The tax treatment of the Internet and e-commerce is currently unsettled. A
number of proposals have been made at the federal, state and local level and by
certain foreign governments that could impose taxes on the sale of goods and
services and certain other Internet activities. Cybear cannot predict the
effect of current attempts at taxing or regulating commerce over the Internet.
Any legislation that substantially impairs the growth of e-commerce could have
a material adverse effect on Cybear's business, financial condition and
operating results.

     Government regulation of Internet communications may adversely impact
Cybear's business.

     Cybear could become subject to regulation by the Federal Communications
Commission or another regulatory agency as a provider of basic
telecommunications services. Changes in the regulatory environment relating to
the application of access charges and other support payments to Internet and
Internet telephony providers, regulation of Internet services, including
Internet telephony, and other regulatory changes that directly or indirectly
affect costs imposed on Internet or Internet telephony providers,
telecommunications costs or increase in the likelihood or scope of competition,
could make its communications infrastructure more expensive to operate and have
a material adverse impact on its business, financial condition and operating
results.

     Government regulation of healthcare may adversely impact Cybear's
business.

     The impact of regulatory developments in the healthcare industry is
complex and difficult to predict, and Cybear cannot guarantee that it will not
be materially adversely affected by existing or new regulatory requirements or
interpretations. Participants in the healthcare industry are subject to
extensive and frequently changing regulation under numerous laws administered
by governmental entities at the federal, state and local levels. Many current
laws and regulations, when enacted, did not anticipate the methods of
healthcare communication that Cybear is developing. Cybear believes, however,
that these laws and regulations may nonetheless be applied to its healthcare
communications business. Accordingly, Cybear's healthcare communications
business may be affected by current regulations as well as future regulations
specifically targeted to this new segment of the healthcare industry.

     Current laws and regulations that may affect the healthcare communications
business include:

     o the regulation of confidential patient medical record information;

   o laws relating to the electronic transmission of prescriptions from
      physicians' offices to pharmacies;

   o regulations governing the use of software applications in the diagnosis,
      cure, treatment, mitigation or prevention of disease; and

     o laws or regulations relating to the relationships between or among
healthcare providers.

     There may also be future legislation and regulation in these areas, both
at the state and federal level.

Risks Related to Andrx

     Andrx's business is subject to substantial litigation which could expose
Andrx to unfavorable claims.

     Andrx has and continues to face substantial patent infringement litigation
with respect to the manufacture, use and sale of its products. To date, actions
have been filed against Andrx in connection with substantially all of Andrx's
Abbreviated New Drug Applications or ANDAs. When Andrx files an ANDA, Andrx
usually certifies that it believes the proposed product will not infringe an
unexpired patent which has been listed with the U.S. Food and Drug
Administration, or FDA, as covering the brand name product and/or that such
patent is invalid or unenforceable. Andrx anticipates that additional actions
may be filed as Andrx or Andrx's collaborative partners file additional ANDAs.
Patent litigation may also be brought against Andrx in connection with certain
other products that Andrx may pursue.

     The timing and outcome of this type of litigation is difficult to predict
because of the uncertainties inherent in patent litigation. There can be no
assurance that any of Andrx's products will be commercialized immediately
following FDA's approval of their sale, as Andrx will launch Andrx's products
only after it is both lawful and Andrx determines that it appears prudent to do
so. Andrx's business and financial results could be materially harmed by the
delays in marketing Andrx's products as a result of litigation, an unfavorable
outcome in any litigation or the expense of litigation whether or not it is
successful.

     Andrx is subject to antitrust litigation and an FTC administrative
proceeding relating to a stipulation Andrx entered into with Aventis, S.A.
which, if adversely determined, would harm Andrx's business and financial
results.

     Class and individual actions have been filed against Andrx in a number of
state and federal courts relating to a stipulation Andrx entered into with
Aventis. In each of these suits, Andrx and Aventis and some of Andrx's
affiliates, have been named as co-defendants. Andrx entered into the
stipulation with Aventis in connection with patent infringement litigation that
Aventis brought against Andrx. In the stipulation, Andrx agreed to maintain the
status quo, which included not commencing to market Andrx's bioequivalent
version of Cardizem CD until the earlier of final resolution of the Aventis
litigation or the occurrence of certain other events. Aventis agreed, among
other matters, not to seek a preliminary injunction against Andrx in the
then-pending litigation, granted Andrx the right to obtain a license to the
relevant Aventis' patents at various times and made certain payments to Andrx.
The complaint in each of these actions alleges that by entering into the
stipulation, Andrx and Aventis violated certain antitrust, restraint of trade
and other laws which allegedly gave Aventis and Andrx a monopoly in the U.S.
market for Cardizem CD and a bioequivalent version of that product. The
complaints in each of the class actions seek compensatory damages on behalf of
each class member in an unspecified amount and, in some cases, treble damages,
as well as costs and counsel fees, disgorgement, injunctive relief and other
remedies.

     An adverse outcome in the class actions, individual actions and the
expense to Andrx of defending such actions, whether or not there is an adverse
outcome, could materially harm Andrx's business and financial results.

     On March 16, 2000, Andrx was named as a respondent by the FTC Commission
in an administrative action seeking a cease and desist order against future
agreements similar to the stipulation and other remedies. The complaint in the
administrative proceeding does not seek any monetary remedies from Andrx of any
kind. On November 28, 2000, an order was entered in the administrative
proceeding withdrawing the matter from the adjudicative part of the agency for
the purpose of permitting the FTC to consider a proposed consent agreement
resolving the matter. Andrx does not know when the FTC will consider the
proposed settlement or whether it will be accepted.

     Biovail Corporation International has recently advised Andrx that Andrx's
sale of Cartia XT, Andrx's generic version of Cardizem CD, breaches an
agreement made between Andrx and Aventis to settle patent infringement
litigation over Cartia XT. Biovail claims a right to enforce that agreement
because of its acquisition of the Cardizem line from Aventis and contends that
product allegedly manufactured by Andrx is not in conformity with the agreement
and should be withdrawn from the market. Having investigated the matter, Andrx
believes that Biovail's contention is wholly without merit.

     Andrx's future results of operations will be adversely affected if Andrx
is unable to market new pharmaceutical products and Andrx existing products.

     Andrx's future results of operations will depend significantly upon its
ability to develop and market new pharmaceutical products and its existing
ones, since Andrx only has a limited number of commercialized products and
these and other products typically have declining revenues over their product
life. To date, the FDA has approved the marketing of only four of Andrx's
products. The FDA has tentatively approved three additional products Andrx
developed. These products and other products Andrx may develop typically have
declining revenues over their product lives. Andrx cannot assure you that its
products under development or products submitted to the FDA will be approved
for sale by the FDA or other regulatory authorities.

     Andrx's operating results may vary significantly on an annual or quarterly
basis depending on the timing of, and Andrx's ability to obtain, FDA approvals
for Andrx's new products. Newly introduced bioequivalent pharmaceuticals with
limited or no competition are typically sold at higher selling prices,

often resulting in higher gross profit margins. Competition from other
manufacturers typically results in a decline in selling prices and gross profit
margins. The timing of Andrx's future operating results may also be affected by
a variety of additional factors, including the results of future patent
challenges and market acceptance of Andrx's new products.

     Andrx is subject to stringent governmental regulation and a costly and
time consuming approval process for its products.

     Drug manufacturers are required to obtain FDA approval before marketing
their new drug product candidates. The FDA approval requirements are costly and
time consuming. Andrx cannot assure you that Andrx's bioequivalence or clinical
studies and other data will result in FDA approval to market Andrx's new drug
products. Andrx believes that the FDA's ANDA procedures will apply to its
bioequivalent versions of controlled-release drugs. Andrx cannot assure you
that any of its bioequivalent versions of controlled-release drugs will be
suitable for, or approved as part of, abbreviated applications. Moreover, once
a drug is approved under either procedure, Andrx cannot assure you that it will
not have to withdraw such product from the market if it is not manufactured in
accordance with FDA standards or Andrx's own internal standards.

     Some abbreviated application procedures for bioequivalent
controlled-release drugs and other products are presently the subject of
petitions filed by brand name drug manufacturers, which seek changes from the
FDA in the approval requirements for particular bioequivalent drugs. Andrx
cannot predict at this time whether the FDA will make any changes to Andrx's
abbreviated application requirements as a result of these petitions or the
effect that any changes may have on Andrx. Any changes in FDA regulations or
policies may make abbreviated application approvals more difficult and thus may
materially harm Andrx's business and financial results.

     In order to market a new drug that does not qualify for the FDA's
abbreviated application procedures, Andrx must conduct extensive clinical
trials to demonstrate product safety and efficacy and submit a new drug
application on NDA. The process of completing clinical trials and preparing an
NDA may take several years and requires substantial resources. Andrx has never
submitted an NDA. Andrx cannot assure you that Andrx's studies and filings will
result in FDA approval to market Andrx's new drug products or the timing of any
approval.

     Patent certification requirements for bioequivalent controlled-release
drugs and for some new drugs could also result in significant delays in
obtaining FDA approval if patent infringement litigation is initiated by the
holder or holders of the brand name patents. Delays in obtaining FDA approval
of abbreviated applications and some new drug applications can also result from
a marketing exclusivity period and/or an extension of patent terms.

     Proposed FDA regulations and guidelines may result in Andrx's
bioequivalent products not being able to fully utilize the 180-day marketing
exclusivity period which will affect Andrx's results of operations.

     Any inability to fully use the 180-day marketing exclusivity period for
any of Andrx's products will affect Andrx's results of operations. In August
1999, the FDA proposed to amend its regulations relating to 180-day marketing
exclusivity for which certain bioequivalent drugs may qualify. Andrx cannot
predict whether or what changes the FDA may make to those regulations. In March
2000, the FDA issued new guidelines regarding the timing of approval of ANDAs
following a court decision in patent infringement actions and the start of the
180-day marketing exclusivity period provided for in the Waxman-Hatch
amendments applicable to generic pharmaceuticals. These guidelines could result
in Andrx not being able to utilize all or any portion of the 180-day marketing
exclusivity period on ANDA products Andrx was the first to file on, depending
on the timing of court decisions in patent litigation. Andrx is unable to
predict what impact, if any, the FDA's new guidelines may have on its business
or financial condition.

     Andrx faces uncertainties related to clinical trials which could result in
delays in product development and commercialization.

     Andrx must demonstrate through clinical trials that Andrx's brand name
products under development are safe and effective for use prior to seeking FDA
approval for the commercial sale of these products. There are a number of
difficulties associated with clinical trials and Andrx has limited experience
in conducting and supervising clinical trials. Difficulties with clinical
trials include the possibility that the results may not be indicative of
results that would be obtained from large-scale testing and that patients can
die, suffer adverse medical effects or artificially affect the clinical trial
results. Moreover, Andrx cannot assure you that its clinical trials will
demonstrate sufficient safety and efficacy to obtain FDA approval. A number of
companies in the pharmaceutical industry have suffered significant setbacks in
advanced clinical trials even after promising results in pre-clinical studies.
These failures have often resulted in decreases in stock prices. If any of
Andrx's products under development are not shown to be safe and effective in
clinical trials, Andrx's business and financial results could be materially
harmed by any resulting delays in developing other compounds and conducting
related clinical trials.

     Andrx's business and results of operations could be materially harmed if
Andrx does not comply with the restrictive FDA regulations governing the
manufacturing and distribution of Andrx's products.

     The FDA also regulates the development, manufacture, distribution,
labeling and promotion of prescription drugs, requires that certain records be
kept and reports be made, mandates registration of drug manufacturers and
listing of their products and has the authority to inspect manufacturing
facilities for compliance with Current Good Manufacturing Practices or cGMP
standards. As a wholesale distributor of bioequivalent pharmaceuticals, Andrx
is subject to state licensure and other requirements pertaining to the
wholesale distribution of prescription drugs. Andrx's business and financial
results could be materially harmed by any failure to comply with licensing and
other requirements.

     Other requirements exist for controlled drugs, such as narcotics, which
are regulated by the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration or DEA and comparable
state-level agencies. The FDA also has the authority to withdraw approvals of
previously approved drugs for cause, to request recalls of products, to bar
companies and individuals from future drug application submissions and, through
action in court, to seize products, institute criminal prosecution or close
manufacturing plants in response to violations. The DEA has similar authority
and may also pursue monetary penalties. Andrx's business and financial results
could be materially harmed by these requirements or FDA or DEA actions.

     Andrx's business could suffer if Andrx is unable to increase its
manufacturing capacity.

     Andrx's approximately 35,000 square foot commercial manufacturing facility
is currently being used to manufacture Cartia XT and Diltia XT and is expected
to be only sufficient for these products and for certain of Andrx's other
products. Andrx is in the process of expanding Andrx's manufacturing capacity
in order to be able to manufacture all of the products Andrx intends to develop
and manufacture. If Andrx is unable to do so in a timely manner, Andrx's
business will suffer.

     Andrx's manufacturing facilities must comply with stringent FDA and other
regulatory requirements.

     Andrx's new manufacturing facilities, once completed, will need to be in
compliance with cGMP and inspected. Andrx cannot assure you that such approvals
will be obtained or will be obtained in time to manufacture each of its
additional products as they are approved. Andrx's facilities will be subject to
periodic inspections by the FDA and Andrx cannot assure you that the facilities
will continue to be in compliance with cGMP or other regulatory requirements.
Failure to comply with

such requirements could result in significant delays in the development,
approval and distribution of Andrx's planned products, and may require Andrx to
incur significant additional expense to comply with cGMP or other regulatory
requirements. Andrx's business and financial results could be materially harmed
by an adverse determination by the FDA as a result of any such inspection.
Further, Andrx will depend on other companies to manufacture certain of the
product candidates under development.

     The DEA also periodically inspects facilities for compliance with
security, record keeping, and other requirements that govern controlled
substances. Andrx's business and financial results could be materially harmed
by an adverse determination by the DEA as a result of any such inspection.

     Andrx's business will suffer if Andrx is unable to manage its rapid
growth.

     Andrx's business and financial results will be materially harmed if it
fails to manage growth effectively or to develop a successful marketing
approach. Andrx has experienced rapid growth of its operations. This growth has
required Andrx to expand, upgrade and improve its administrative, operational
and management systems, controls and resources. Andrx anticipates additional
growth in connection with the development, manufacturing and marketing of its
products.

     Andrx faces intense competition in the pharmaceutical industry from both
brand-name and bioequivalent manufacturers, wholesalers and distributors that
could severely limit its growth.

     The pharmaceutical industry is highly competitive and many of Andrx's
competitors have longer operating histories and greater financial, research and
development, marketing and other resources than Andrx. Andrx is subject to
competition from numerous other entities that currently operate or intend to
operate in the pharmaceutical industry, including companies that are engaged in
the development of controlled-release drug delivery technologies and
pharmaceuticals and other manufacturers that may decide to undertake in-house
development of these products. Andrx's bioequivalent products may be subject to
competition from competing bioequivalent products marketed by the patent
holder. In Andrx's pharmaceutical distribution business, Andrx competes with a
number of large wholesalers and other distributors of pharmaceuticals. Andrx
cannot assure you that it will be able to continue to compete successfully with
these companies.

     Andrx depends on its patents and trade secrets and Andrx's future success
is dependent on its ability to protect these secrets and not infringe on the
rights of others.

     Andrx believes that patent and trade secret protection is important to its
business and that its future success will depend in part on its ability to
obtain patents, maintain trade secret protection and operate without infringing
on the rights of others. Andrx has been issued a number of U.S. patents and
have filed additional U.S. and various foreign patent applications relating to
Andrx's drug delivery technologies. Andrx expects to apply for additional U.S.
and foreign patents in the future. The issuance of a patent is not conclusive
as to Andrx's validity or as to the enforceable scope of the claims of the
patent. Andrx cannot assure you that:

     o Andrx's processes or products will not infringe upon the patents of
      third parties;

   o Andrx's patents or any future patents will prevent other companies from
      developing similar or functionally equivalent products or from
      successfully challenging the validity of Andrx's patents;

     o any of Andrx's future processes or products will be patentable; or

     o any pending or additional patents will be issued in any or all
appropriate jurisdictions.

     Andrx's business and financial results could be materially harmed if Andrx
fails to avoid infringement of the patent or proprietary rights of others or to
protect its patent rights.

     Andrx also relies on trade secrets and proprietary knowledge, which Andrx
generally seeks to protect by confidentiality and non-disclosure agreements
with employees, consultants, licensees and pharmaceutical companies. Andrx
cannot assure that these agreements will not be breached, that it will have
adequate remedies for any breach or that its trade secrets will not otherwise
become known by competitors.

     Andrx will need an effective sales organization to market and sell its
future brand products and Andrx's failure to have an effective sales
organization may harm its business.

     Andrx does not have an established sales organization to market and sell
its brand products that it may develop or acquire. Andrx cannot assure you that
prior to the time these products are available for commercial launch, Andrx
will be able to license its products to pharmaceutical companies with sales
organizations, enter into a favorable co-promotion or contract sales
arrangement, or build an effective sales organization. Andrx's inability to
enter into satisfactory sales and marketing arrangements in the future may
materially harm its business and financial results. Andrx may have to rely on
collaborative partners to market its products. These partners may not have the
same interests as Andrx in marketing the products and Andrx may lose control
over the sales of these products.

     Decreases in healthcare reimbursements could limit Andrx's ability to sell
its products or decrease its revenues.

     Andrx's ability to maintain profitability in Andrx's distribution business
or to commercialize its product candidates depends in part on the extent to
which reimbursement for the cost of pharmaceuticals will be available from
government health administration agencies, private health insurers and other
organizations. In addition, third party payors are attempting to control costs
by limiting the level of reimbursement for medical products, including
pharmaceuticals, which may adversely affect the pricing of Andrx's product
candidates. Moreover, healthcare reform has been, and may continue to be, an
area of national and state focus, which could result in the adoption of
measures which could adversely affect the pricing of pharmaceuticals or the
amount of reimbursement available from third party payors. Andrx cannot assure
you that healthcare providers, patients or third party payors will accept and
pay for Andrx's pharmaceuticals. In addition, there is no guarantee that
healthcare reimbursement laws or policies will not materially harm Andrx's
ability to sell its products profitably or prevent it from realizing an
appropriate return on its investment in product development.

     Andrx may be subject to product liability claims and may not have adequate
insurance.

     The design, development and manufacture of Andrx's products or the product
Andrx distributes involve a risk of product liability claims and Andrx cannot
assure you that the coverage limits of its insurance will be sufficient to
cover potential claims. Andrx has obtained product liability insurance and
believe that it is adequate for its current operations, but may seek to
increase its coverage prior to the commercial introduction of its new product
candidates. Product liability insurance is expensive and difficult to obtain
and may not be available in the future on acceptable terms or in sufficient
amounts, if available at all. Andrx's business and financial results could be
materially harmed by a successful claim against Andrx in excess of its
insurance coverage.

Risks Associated With Having Two Classes of Common Stock

     Financial effects on one class could adversely affect the other class.

     Holders of Andrx common stock and Cybear tracking stock are common
stockholders of Andrx Corporation, and will continue to be subject to all of
the risks of an investment in Andrx Corporation and all of its businesses,
assets and liabilities. The assets attributed to one class may be subject to
the

liabilities of the other class, even if these liabilities arise from lawsuits,
contracts or indebtedness attributed to the other class. If Andrx Corporation
is unable to satisfy one classes' liabilities with the assets attributed to it,
Andrx Corporation may satisfy those liabilities with assets it has attributed
to the other class.

     Financial effects on one class that affect the consolidated results of
operations or financial condition of Andrx Corporation could, if significant,
affect the results of operations or financial condition of the other class and
the market price of the common stock relating to the other class. In addition,
net losses of either class and dividends and distributions on, or repurchases
of, either class of common stock will reduce the funds that can be paid as
dividends on each class of common stock under Delaware law. For these reasons,
you should read Andrx Corporation's consolidated financial information
incorporated by reference in this proxy statement/prospectus.

     Holders of each class of common stock will have only limited class
stockholder rights.

     Holders of Andrx common stock and the Cybear tracking stock generally will
not have stockholder rights specific to their corresponding groups. Rather,
stockholders will have customary stockholder rights relating to Andrx
Corporation as a whole. For example, holders of Andrx common stock and the
Cybear tracking stock will vote as a single class to approve a disposition of
all or substantially all of Andrx Corporation's assets and holders of both
classes are entitled to receive a percentage of all of Andrx Corporation's
assets in the case of a liquidation. Holders of either Andrx common stock or
the Cybear tracking stock will have the following rights with respect to their
class of common stock:

   o an opportunity to receive dividends, if any, when, as and if declared by
      Andrx Corporation's board of directors;

   o an opportunity to have the Cybear tracking stock redeemed or converted
      into Andrx common stock upon the disposition of all or substantially all
      of the assets of Cybear; and

   o a right to vote separately as a class only on matters which are set forth
      in the Andrx Corporation certificate of incorporation or as may be
      required under Delaware law under the rules of any exchange or electronic
      trading system.

     Andrx Corporation will not hold separate meetings for holders of Cybear
tracking stock or Andrx common stock.

     The aggregate voting power of all of the outstanding shares of the Cybear
tracking stock is limited to 25% of the total voting power of all of the
outstanding shares of both classes of Andrx Corporation's common stock.

     Except for limited matters on which a separate class vote may be required,
the Andrx common stock and the Cybear tracking stock will vote together as a
single class on all matters requiring a stockholder vote. Matters on which the
Andrx common stock and the Cybear tracking stock will vote together may involve
an apparent or real divergence of interests between the holders of each class
of common stock in the aggregate. The aggregate voting power of all of the
outstanding shares of the Cybear tracking stock is limited to 25% of the total
voting power of all of the outstanding shares of both classes of Andrx
Corporation common stock. Consequently, the aggregate voting power of all of
the outstanding shares of Andrx common stock will represent a majority of the
outstanding voting power of all of the outstanding shares of both classes of
common stock. To the extent that matters come before the stockholders on which
the holders of Andrx common stock and the holders of the Cybear tracking stock
have a divergence of interests but vote as a single class, the holders of Andrx
common stock, to the extent they vote in a similar manner, will be able to
control the vote. These matters may include mergers or other extraordinary
transactions. In addition, the issuance or repurchase of shares of either class
of common stock could cause changes in the relative voting power of the groups,
subject to the 25% limitation on the voting power of the Cybear tracking stock
described above.

     In limited circumstances where a separate class vote is required, the
class of common stock with less than majority voting power can block action.

     If Andrx Corporation's certificate of incorporation, Delaware law or
market rules require a separate vote on any matter by the holders of either the
Andrx common stock or the Cybear tracking stock, those holders could prevent
approval of the matter, even if the holders of a majority of the total number
of votes cast or entitled to be cast, voting together as a class, were to vote
in favor of it.

     Holders of either class of common stock could be adversely affected by a
conversion of the Cybear tracking stock.

     At any time or upon the occurrence of certain tax-related events, Andrx
Corporation's board of directors, in its sole discretion and without
stockholder approval, could determine to convert shares of the Cybear tracking
stock into shares of Andrx common stock, including a conversion at a time when
either or both classes of common stock may be considered to be overvalued or
undervalued. Any conversion at a premium would dilute the interests of the
holders of the Andrx common stock in Andrx Corporation. Any conversion would
also preclude holders of both classes of common stock from retaining their
investment in a security that is intended to reflect separately the performance
of the groups. It may also give holders of shares of converted Cybear tracking
stock a greater or lesser consideration than any consideration a third-party
buyer would pay for all or substantially all of the assets of Cybear.

     Stockholders may not have any remedies for breach of fiduciary duties if
any action by directors and officers has a disadvantageous effect on either
class of common stock.

     Stockholders may not have any remedies if an action or decision of Andrx
Corporation's board of directors or its officers has a disadvantageous effect
on the Andrx common stock or the Cybear tracking stock compared to the other
class of common stock. Recent cases in Delaware Court involving tracking stocks
have indicated that decisions by directors or officers involving differing
treatment of tracking stocks should be judged under the business judgment rule,
unless self-interest is established. The business judgment rule provides that
an informed director or officer will be deemed to have satisfied his or her
fiduciary duties if that person acts in a manner he or she believes in good
faith to be in the best interests of Andrx Corporation. Because of the
application of the business judgment rule, holders of one group's stock who are
disadvantaged by an action of Andrx Corporation's board of directors or
officers may not be able to successfully make claims that a decision involving
different treatment of the Andrx common stock or the Cybear tracking stock was
wrongful, absent a showing of self-interest by directors or officers.

     Stock ownership could cause directors and officers to favor one group over
the other.

     The directors and officers of Andrx Corporation currently own more shares,
including shares subject to stock options, of Andrx common stock than Cybear
tracking stock. As a policy, Andrx Corporation's board of directors
periodically monitors the ownership of shares of Andrx common stock and shares
of Cybear tracking stock by its directors and executive officers and its option
grants to them so that their interests are generally aligned with the two
classes of common stock and with their duty to act in the best interests of
Andrx Corporation and its stockholders as a whole. However, because the actual
value of their interests in Andrx common stock and Cybear tracking stock
currently varies significantly, it is possible that they could favor one group
over the other due to their stock and option holdings.

     Numerous potential conflicts of interests exist between classes of common
stock which may be difficult to resolve by Andrx Corporation's board of
directors or which may be resolved adversely to one of the classes.

     The existence of different classes of common stock could give rise to
occasions when the interests of holders of Andrx common stock and Cybear
tracking stock diverge, conflict or appear to diverge or conflict.

     Andrx Corporation's board of directors may pay more or less dividends on
one group's common stock than if that group was a separate company.

     Andrx Corporation's board of directors has the authority to declare and
pay dividends on each class of common stock in any amount and could, in its
sole discretion, declare and pay dividends exclusively on Andrx common stock,
exclusively on the Cybear tracking stock, or on both, in equal or unequal
amounts. Andrx Corporation's board of directors will not be required to
consider the amount of dividends previously declared on each class, the
respective voting or liquidation rights of each class or any other factor. The
performance of one group may cause Andrx Corporation's board of directors to
pay more or less dividends on the common stock relating to the other group than
if that other group was a stand-alone corporation. In addition, Delaware law
and the Andrx Corporation certificate of incorporation may impose limitations
on the amount of dividends which may be paid on each class of common stock.

     Proceeds of mergers or consolidations may be allocated unfavorably.

     Andrx Corporation's certificate of incorporation and bylaws do not contain
any provisions governing how consideration to be received by holders of Andrx
common stock or the Cybear tracking stock in connection with a merger or
consolidation involving Andrx is to be allocated among holders of each class of
common stock. Andrx Corporation's board of directors will make that
determination. That determination could favor the holders of one class of
common stock at the expense of the holders of the other class of common stock.

     Allocation of corporate opportunities could favor Andrx or Cybear over the
other.

     Andrx Corporation's board of directors may be required to allocate
corporate opportunities between Andrx and Cybear. In some cases, the directors
could determine that a corporate opportunity, such as a business that Andrx may
be acquiring, should be shared by Cybear. Any such decisions could favor one
class at the expense of the other.

     Andrx and Cybear may compete with each other to the detriment of their
businesses.

     The existence of two separate classes of common stock will not prevent
Andrx and Cybear from competing with each other. Any competition between Andrx
and Cybear could be detrimental to the businesses of either or both of them.
Under a policy of the Andrx Corporation board of directors, Andrx and Cybear
will generally not engage in the principal businesses of the other. However,
Andrx Corporation's board of directors will permit indirect competition between
Andrx and Cybear based on a good faith business judgment that such competition
is the best interests of Andrx Corporation and all of its stockholders as a
whole. In addition, Andrx and Cybear may compete in a business that is not a
principal business of the other.

     Andrx and Cybear may finance each other on unfavorable terms.

     It is possible that Andrx Corporation will transfer cash and other
property between Andrx and Cybear to finance each of their business activities.
The party providing the financing will be subject to the risks relating to the
party receiving the financing. Andrx Corporation will account for those
transfers in one of the following ways:

     o as a short-term or long-term loan between groups or as a repayment of a
previous borrowing;

     o as an increase or decrease in the equity interest; or

     o as a sale of assets between the two groups.

     Andrx Corporation's board of directors has not adopted specific criteria
for determining when it will transfer cash or other property as a loan or
repayment, an increase or decrease in equity interest or a sale of assets.
These determinations, including the terms of any transactions accounted for as
debt, could be unfavorable to either the party transferring or the party
receiving the cash or other property. Andrx Corporation's board of directors
expects to make these determinations, either in specific instances or by
setting generally applicable policies, after considering the financing
requirements and objectives of the receiving party, the investment objectives
of the transferring party and the availability, cost and time associated with
alternative financing sources, prevailing interest rates and general economic
conditions.

     Andrx and Cybear cannot assure you that any terms that are fixed for debt
will approximate those that could have been obtained by the borrower if it were
a stand-alone corporation.

     Cybear may not be fully reimbursed for Andrx's use of its tax benefits and
could pay higher future taxes than if it were a stand-alone taxpayer.

     A tax sharing agreement entered into between Andrx and Cybear provides
that tax benefits generated but not used by Cybear in the year generated may be
used by other members of Andrx Corporation's consolidated group. Such other
group members are not required to compensate Cybear for the use of Cybear's tax
attributes. Accordingly, on a cash basis, any tax benefits generated by Cybear
and utilized by other members of the consolidated group will not be available
as a carry-forward to reduce Cybear's future tax liabilities. This could result
in Cybear reporting higher corporate tax liability in the future than would
have been the case if Cybear had retained its tax benefits.

     Holders of the Cybear tracking stock may receive less consideration upon a
sale of all or substantially all of its assets than if the group was a separate
company.

     Andrx Corporation's certificate of incorporation provides that if a
disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of Cybear occurs, Andrx
Corporation must, subject to certain exceptions:

   o distribute to holders of the Cybear tracking stock an amount equal to the
      net proceeds of such disposition, or

   o convert at a 110% exchange ratio the Cybear tracking stock into shares of
      the Andrx common stock.

If Cybear tracking stock was a separate, independent company and its shares
were acquired by another person, certain costs of that disposition, including
corporate level taxes, might or might not be payable in connection with that
acquisition. As a result, stockholders of a separate, independent company might
receive a greater amount than the net proceeds that would be received by
holders of Cybear tracking stock if the assets of Cybear were sold. In
addition, Andrx Corporation cannot assure

you that the net proceeds per share of Cybear tracking stock will be equal to
or more than the market value per share of Cybear tracking stock prior to or
after announcement of a disposition.

     Provisions governing the two classes of common stock could discourage a
change of control and the payment of a premium for shares.

     The existence of two classes of common stock could present complexities
and could pose obstacles, financial or otherwise, to a person seeking to
acquire control of Andrx Corporation. In addition, provisions of Delaware law
and Andrx Corporation's certificate of incorporation and bylaws may also deter
hostile takeover attempts. If Andrx and Cybear were separate, independent
publicly traded companies, any person interested in acquiring either group
without negotiating with the other group's management could seek control of
that entity by obtaining control of its outstanding voting stock by means of a
tender offer or proxy contest. A person interested in acquiring only one group
would still be required to seek control of the majority of the voting power
represented by all the outstanding stock of Andrx.

     Investors may not value the common stock based on group financial
information and policies.

     Andrx Corporation cannot assure you that investors will value the Andrx
common stock and the Cybear tracking stock based on the reported financial
results and prospects of Andrx and Cybear or the dividend policies established
by the board of directors with respect to the groups.

     Andrx Corporation's board of directors may change or make exceptions to
the management and allocation policies to the detriment of one group without
stockholder approval.

     Andrx Corporation's board of directors has adopted management and
allocation policies to govern the relationship between the Andrx common stock
and the Cybear tracking stock. Andrx Corporation's board of directors may
modify or rescind, or make exceptions to, the policies with respect to the
allocation of corporate opportunities, financing arrangements, shared corporate
services, competition between the groups, taxes, debt, interest and other
matters, or may adopt additional policies, in its sole discretion without
stockholder approval. A decision to modify, rescind or make exceptions to these
policies or adopt additional policies, could have different effects on the
holders of the Andrx common stock and the holders of the Cybear tracking stock
or could adversely affect the holders of one class of common stock compared to
the holders of the other class of common stock.

     The anti-takeover provisions of Andrx Corporation's charter documents and
Delaware law could affect stockholders.

     Certain provisions of Andrx Corporation's certificate of incorporation and
bylaws may have anti-takeover effects and may delay, defer or prevent a
takeover attempt of Andrx Corporation. Andrx Corporation is also subject to the
anti-takeover provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation
Law, which will prohibit Andrx Corporation from engaging in a "business
combination" with an "interested stockholder" for a period of three years after
the date of the transaction in which the persons became an interested
stockholder, unless the business combination is approved in a prescribed
manner. The application of Section 203 also could have the effect of delaying
or preventing a change of control of Andrx Corporation.

(1) Commencing January 28, 1999.

     Neither Mediconsult nor Andrx Corporation has ever paid any dividends on
its respective common stock. On February 12, 2001, the most recent practicable
date prior to the filing of this document, the closing price per share as
reported by the Nasdaq National Market of the Cybear tracking stock was $0.4375
and the last closing price per share of the Mediconsult common stock was
$0.0938. We urge stockholders to obtain current quotations.

     In November 2000, Nasdaq notified Mediconsult that the Mediconsult common
stock is not in compliance with the continued listing requirements of the
Nasdaq National Market because the Mediconsult common stock failed to maintain
a bid price of $1.00 for 30 consecutive trading days. In addition, Nasdaq
recently notified Mediconsult that the Mediconsult common stock is not in
compliance with the continued listing requirements of the Nasdaq National
Market because Mediconsult no longer met a minimum net tangible asset
requirement. Mediconsult's failure to comply

with the continued listing requirements may result in the Mediconsult common
stock being delisted. Mediconsult has appealed Nasdaq's decision, delaying the
delisting of the Mediconsult common stock until a decision has been rendered on
Mediconsult's appeal.

     Nasdaq also recently notified Andrx Corporation that the Cybear tracking
stock is not in compliance with the continued listing requirements of the
Nasdaq National Market because the Cybear tracking stock failed to maintain a
bid price of $1.00 for 30 consecutive trading days. If the Cybear tracking
stock does not meet the minimum bid price requirement on or prior to February
21, 2001, Andrx Corporation intends to file an appeal with Nasdaq.

                           THE STOCKHOLDERS MEETING

     We are furnishing this document to the Mediconsult stockholders in
connection with the solicitation of proxies by Mediconsult's board of directors
at a special meeting of its stockholders, and at any adjournments or
postponements of the meeting.

The Mediconsult Special Meeting

Where and When the Mediconsult Special Meeting Will be Held

     The special meeting will be held at the offices of Mediconsult, whose
address is 560 White Plains Road, Tarrytown, New York 10591 starting at 10:00
A.M., local time on March 20, 2001.

What Will be Voted Upon

     At the special meeting, the Mediconsult stockholders will consider and
vote upon a proposal to adopt a merger agreement.

Only Mediconsult Stockholders of Record on January 31, 2001 Are Entitled to
Vote

     Currently, the only outstanding voting securities of Mediconsult are
shares of Mediconsult common stock. Only holders of record of Mediconsult
common stock on the record date, January 31, 2001, are entitled to notice of
and vote at the Mediconsult special meeting. Each holder of record, as of the
record date, of Mediconsult common stock is entitled to cast one vote per
share.

     On the record date, there were 55,690,636 shares of Mediconsult common
stock outstanding and entitled to vote at the Mediconsult special meeting.
These outstanding shares are held by approximately 305 Mediconsult stockholders
of record.

Required Quorum and Vote for Approval

     The holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of Mediconsult common
stock must be present, in person or by proxy, at the special meeting for there
to be a quorum. The favorable vote of a majority of the shares of Mediconsult
common stock outstanding on the Mediconsult record date is required for
adoption of the merger agreement. On the record date, directors and executive
officers of Mediconsult owned and were entitled to vote 15,383,752 shares of
Mediconsult common stock, or approximately 27.2% of the shares of Mediconsult
common stock outstanding on the Mediconsult record date. Robert A. Jennings, a
principal stockholder and director of Mediconsult, and JHC Limited, an entity
controlled by Mr. Jennings, together representing 12,597,752 shares of
Mediconsult common stock or 22.6% of the outstanding shares of Mediconsult
common stock, have already contractually agreed to vote in favor of the merger.

     If you fail to vote or abstain from voting, it has the effect of a vote
against the merger.

Voting of Proxies

     All shares of Mediconsult common stock represented by proxies properly
received prior to or at the Mediconsult special meeting and not revoked, will
be voted in accordance with the instructions indicated in such proxies. If
stockholders do not indicate any instructions on a properly executed and
returned proxy, that proxy will be voted FOR the approval of the merger.

     If any other matters are properly presented at the special meeting for
consideration, the persons named in the enclosed form of proxy, and acting
under that proxy, will have discretion to vote on such matters in accordance
with their best judgment, unless authorization to use that discretion is
withheld. If a proposal to adjourn the special meeting is properly presented,
the persons named in the enclosed form of proxy will not have discretion to
vote shares voted against the proposal to adopt the merger agreement.

     Any proxy given pursuant to this solicitation may be revoked by the person
giving it at any time before it is voted. Proxies may be revoked by:

   o filing, including by telegram or telecopy, with Mediconsult's Secretary,
     before the taking of the vote at the meeting, a written notice of
     revocation bearing a later date than the date of the proxy or a
     later-dated proxy relating to the same shares; or

     o attending the meeting and voting in person.

     In order to vote in person at the special meeting, the Mediconsult
stockholders must attend the meeting and cast their votes in accordance with
the voting procedures established for the meeting. Attendance at a meeting will
not in and of itself constitute a revocation of a proxy. Any written notice of
revocation or subsequent proxy must be sent so as to be delivered at or before
the taking of the vote at the meeting as follows to: Mediconsult.com, Inc., 560
White Plains Road, Tarrytown, New York 10591, Telecopy: (914) 332-6448,
Attention: Secretary.

     It is the policy of Mediconsult to keep confidential proxy cards, ballots
and voting tabulations that identify individual stockholders, except where
disclosure is mandated by law and in other limited circumstances.

     Mediconsult stockholders who require assistance in changing or revoking a
proxy should contact the person at the address or phone number provided in this
document under the caption "Who Can Help Answer Your Questions."

Abstentions; Broker Non Votes

     Adoption of the merger agreement requires a favorable vote of the majority
of all outstanding shares of Mediconsult common stock, so an abstention will
have the effect of a vote against the merger. The failure of a Mediconsult
stockholder to return a proxy will have the effect of not being counted for
purposes of determining the presence of a quorum.

     Under applicable rules, brokers who hold shares in street name for
customers have the authority to vote on some routine proposals when they have
not received instructions from beneficial owners. Under applicable rules, these
brokers are precluded from exercising their voting discretion with respect to
the approval and adoption of non-routine matters like the merger, and, thus,
absent specific instructions from the beneficial owner of shares held in street
name, brokers are not empowered to vote these shares with respect to the
adoption of the merger, i.e., broker non-votes. Therefore, a broker non-vote
will not be counted for purposes of determining the presence of a quorum, but
it will otherwise have the same effect as an abstention.

Solicitation of Proxies

     Mediconsult shall pay the cost of soliciting proxies. In addition to
solicitation by mail, arrangements will be made with brokerage houses and other
custodians, nominees and fiduciaries to send the proxy materials to beneficial
owners, and Mediconsult will, upon written request, reimburse those brokerage
houses and custodians for their reasonable expenses in so doing. Mediconsult
may retain a proxy solicitor to aid in the solicitation of proxies and to
verify records related to the solicitations. Each proxy solicitor will receive
customary fees and expense reimbursement for their services. To the extent
necessary in order to ensure sufficient representation at its meeting,
Mediconsult may request by telephone or telegram the return of proxy cards. The
extent to which this will be necessary depends entirely upon how promptly
proxies are received. We urge stockholders to vote proxies without delay.

Stock Certificates

     Mediconsult stockholders should not send in any stock certificates with
their proxy cards. A transmittal letter with instructions for the surrender of
certificates representing shares of Mediconsult common stock will be mailed to
the Mediconsult stockholders as soon as practicable after the consummation of
the merger.

                      THE MERGER AND THE MERGER AGREEMENT

Description of the Merger

     The merger agreement provides that a wholly-owned a subsidiary of Andrx
Corporation will merge with and into Mediconsult, which shall be the surviving
corporation of the merger and, as a result thereof, become a wholly-owned
subsidiary of Andrx Corporation. Each share of Mediconsult common stock issued
and outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the merger shall be
canceled and extinguished and be converted automatically into the right to
receive 0.1430 shares of Cybear tracking stock, subject to adjustment as
provided in the merger agreement. In addition, options and warrants to purchase
shares of Mediconsult common stock that are outstanding immediately before the
effective time of the merger will be assumed by Andrx Corporation and converted
into options and warrants to purchase shares of Cybear tracking stock at the
rate of 0.1430, subject to adjustment, shares of Cybear tracking stock for each
share of Mediconsult common stock into which the option or warrant is
convertible. If the merger agreement is adopted at the special meeting, all
required consents and approvals are obtained and all other conditions of the
obligations of the parties to consummate the merger are either satisfied or
waived, the merger will be consummated.

Background of the Merger

     During the last several years, Mediconsult has held conversations with a
number of companies to evaluate possible business combinations or strategic
alliances. In the third quarter of 2000, the Mediconsult board of directors
began considering alternatives to maximize stockholder value and raise
additional capital.

     Mediconsult's advisors contacted a number of companies that they and
Mediconsult had identified as candidates for a possible business combination or
strategic alliance with Mediconsult. In the last week of August 2000, Robert A.
Jennings, the then Chairman of Mediconsult, received an indication of interest
from a third party regarding a possible strategic transaction or business
combination between the two companies.

     Beginning the first week in September 2000, Ian Sutcliffe, Chief Executive
Officer of Mediconsult, and E. Michael Ingram, Chief Financial Officer of
Mediconsult, had several telephone conversations with the senior management of
the third party who had expressed an interest in Mediconsult to explore the
possibility of a strategic transaction between the companies.

     An initial meeting with senior management of this third party was held on
Monday, September 18, 2000, to discuss potential terms for a transaction
between the two companies. Meetings between the two parties continued through
the balance of September and into October 2000.

     On October 4, 2000, the Mediconsult board of directors held a special
meeting to discuss possible strategic transactions. At the meeting, Mr. Ingram
disclosed that Mediconsult had been approached by a third party about a
possible transaction between the two companies, a nondisclosure agreement had
been signed by the two companies and due diligence on the third party had
begun.

     At the October 4, 2000 board meeting, Mr. Ingram informed the board of
directors that Mediconsult and its advisors had contacted several other parties
that might be interested in participating in a transaction with Mediconsult.
After contacting the parties, Mediconsult received five responses, of which two
parties declined to engage in discussions. During October, Mediconsult's
management met with three of the parties.

     On October 9, 2000, an initial meeting was held with Timothy Nolan,
President and Chief Operating Officer of Cybear Inc., Andrx Corporation's
wholly-owned subsidiary. Attending for Mediconsult were Messrs. Sutcliffe and
Ingram. This meeting was followed by subsequent meetings in

October and November 2000, attended by additional members of the Cybear and
Mediconsult senior management teams, including complete mutual due diligence
and presentations of corporate strategies and financial plans.

     On October 24, 2000, Mediconsult engaged McFarland Dewey as its financial
advisor.

     On November 2, 2000, the Mediconsult board of directors held a special
meeting to discuss the status of any possible strategic transactions. During
the meeting, Mr. Sutcliffe reported that after exploring options with a number
of potential parties, he believed that only the third party who had approached
Mediconsult in August presented a viable alternative at that time.
Mediconsult's senior management and legal advisors then presented the principal
terms of the proposed combination with the third party who had approached
Mediconsult in August to its board of directors for discussion.

     In the first week of December 2000, Andrx Corporation, via Cybear Inc.,
submitted a proposal to acquire all of the issued and outstanding stock of
Mediconsult in a stock-for-stock acquisition, or a tax-free exchange offer, in
exchange for Cybear tracking stock. On December 4, 2000, the Mediconsult board
of directors held a special meeting to discuss the terms of Cybear's proposal
with Mediconsult's senior management and legal and financial advisors. After
some discussion, the Mediconsult board of directors proposed several
modifications to Cybear's proposal. On December 6, 2000, a term sheet was
signed, including a 21-day exclusivity period.

     On December 8, 2000, Andrx Corporation submitted a draft merger agreement
to Mediconsult. Over the course of the next month, representatives of Andrx
Corporation and Mediconsult and their respective advisors completed their due
diligence investigations and proceeded to negotiate the terms of the final
merger agreement.

     On January 3, 2001, senior executives of both Andrx Corporation and Cybear
made a presentation to the Mediconsult board of directors regarding each of
their respective businesses and the possible benefits of combining Mediconsult
and Cybear.

     On January 4, 2001, the Mediconsult board of directors held a special
meeting to discuss with its financial and legal advisors the details of the
proposed transaction with Cybear, including the consideration of 43%-45% of the
outstanding Cybear tracking stock to be received by Mediconsult's stockholders,
management and certain of Mediconsult's debtors after the merger and a brief
outline of the terms of the $2,000,000 of interim financing that Cybear agreed
to provide to fund Mediconsult's operating costs between the signing and
closing of the proposed transaction. In addition, representatives of Covington
& Burling, Mediconsult's outside legal advisors, made a presentation to the
Mediconsult board of directors regarding their legal due diligence on Cybear
and Andrx Corporation and representatives of McFarland Dewey, financial
advisors to Mediconsult, made a presentation regarding their analysis of the
financial terms of proposed transaction and discussed the results of the
negotiations with the two companies.

     On January 9, 2001, the Mediconsult board of directors held a special
meeting to vote on the proposed transaction with Andrx Corporation and Cybear.
At this meeting, Mr. Ingram summarized the principal terms of the merger
agreement, including the credit agreement and related loan documents. McFarland
Dewey then followed up with a brief review of the presentation they made to the
Mediconsult board of directors at the January 4, 2001 meeting and expressed its
opinion that the exchange ratio was fair to the holders of Mediconsult common
stock, from a financial point of view. Following these presentations and
discussions, the Mediconsult board of directors unanimously approved the merger
agreement. After the close of business that day, Andrx Corporation and
Mediconsult executed the merger agreement and issued a joint press release
announcing the merger on the morning of January 10, 2001.

Opinion of Mediconsult's Financial Advisor

     The board of directors of Mediconsult retained McFarland Dewey to deliver
an opinion in connection with the merger. On January 9, 2001, McFarland Dewey
delivered to the Mediconsult

board of directors an oral opinion, subsequently confirmed by delivery of a
written opinion dated January 9, 2001, to the effect that, as of that date, and
based upon and subject to the factors and assumptions set forth in the opinion,
the exchange ratio was fair from a financial point of view to the holders of
Mediconsult shares.

     The full text of the definitive written McFarland Dewey opinion, dated
January 9, 2001, which sets forth the assumptions made, the procedures
followed, the matters considered and the limitations on the scope of the review
undertaken by McFarland Dewey in rendering its opinion is attached as Annex B
to this proxy statement/prospectus. Mediconsult's stockholders are urged to
read the McFarland Dewey opinion carefully and in its entirety. The summary of
the McFarland Dewey opinion set forth in this proxy statement/prospectus is
qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the opinion.
Mediconsult's stockholders should note that:

   o The opinion does not address the merits of the underlying decision of the
     Mediconsult board of directors to proceed with or effect the merger and
     does not constitute a recommendation to any stockholder as to how such
     stockholder should vote with respect to the merger agreement.

   o McFarland Dewey was not engaged by Mediconsult to participate in or
     advise with respect to the negotiation of the terms of the merger or any
     other alternative transaction and has not done so. Without limiting the
     foregoing, although in connection with the preparation of the opinion,
     McFarland Dewey did not assist Mediconsult in soliciting indications of
     interest from third parties for the acquisition of Mediconsult, McFarland
     Dewey considered the limited market check conducted by Mediconsult's
     previous financial advisor.

   o McFarland Dewey does not express an opinion as to the terms of any
     transaction related to or ancillary to the merger, financial or otherwise,
     such as the financings contemplated by Mediconsult in the form of loan(s)
     from Cybear in connection with the merger.

     The summary set forth below does not purport to be a complete description
of the analyses underlying the McFarland Dewey opinion or the presentation made
by McFarland Dewey to the Mediconsult board of directors. The preparation of a
fairness opinion is a complex analytic process involving various determinations
as to the most appropriate and relevant methods of financial analysis and the
application of those methods to the particular circumstances and, therefore,
such an opinion is not readily susceptible to partial analysis or summary
description. In arriving at its opinion, McFarland Dewey did not attribute any
particular weight to any analysis or factor considered by it, but rather made
qualitative judgments as to the significance and relevance of each analysis and
factor. Accordingly, McFarland Dewey believes that its analysis must be
considered as a whole and that selecting portions of its analysis, without
considering all analyses, would create an incomplete view of the process
underlying its opinion.

     In performing its analyses, numerous assumptions were made with respect to
industry performance, general business, economic, market and financial
conditions and other matters, many of which are beyond the control of McFarland
Dewey, Mediconsult, Cybear or Andrx Corporation. Any estimates contained in the
analyses performed by McFarland Dewey are not necessarily indicative of actual
values or future results, which may be significantly more or less favorable
than suggested by such analyses. Additionally, estimates of the value of
businesses or securities do not purport to be appraisals or to reflect the
prices at which such businesses or securities might actually be sold.
Accordingly, such analyses and estimates are inherently subject to substantial
uncertainty. In addition, as described above, the McFarland Dewey opinion was
among several factors taken into consideration by the Mediconsult board of
directors in making its determination to approve the merger. Consequently, the
McFarland Dewey analyses described below should not be viewed as determinative

of the decision of the Mediconsult board of directors or Mediconsult's
management with respect to the fairness of the exchange ratio of the merger.

     In arriving at its opinion, McFarland Dewey, among other things:

   o reviewed certain publicly available business and financial information
     relating to Mediconsult, Andrx Corporation and Cybear which McFarland
     Dewey deemed to be relevant;

   o reviewed certain confidential information, including financial forecasts
     furnished to McFarland Dewey by Mediconsult, relating to the business,
     earnings, cash flow, assets, liabilities and prospects of each of
     Mediconsult and Cybear;

   o conducted discussions with members of senior management and
     representatives of Mediconsult, Andrx Corporation and Cybear concerning
     the matters described in the clauses above, as well as their respective
     businesses and prospects before and after giving effect to the merger;

     o visited the facilities of both Mediconsult and Cybear;

   o reviewed the market prices and valuation multiples for Mediconsult shares
     of outstanding common stock and Cybear shares of outstanding tracking
     stock and compared them with those of certain publicly traded companies
     which McFarland Dewey deemed to be relevant;

   o reviewed the results of operations of Mediconsult and Cybear and compared
     them with those of certain publicly traded companies which McFarland Dewey
     deemed to be relevant;

   o compared the proposed financial terms of the merger with the financial
     terms of certain other transactions which McFarland Dewey deemed to be
     relevant;

   o reviewed the impact of the merger on the combined company which reflected
     the impact of purchase accounting;

     o reviewed a draft of the merger agreement dated January 5, 2001; and

   o reviewed such other financial studies and analyses and took into account
     such other matters as McFarland Dewey deemed relevant, including McFarland
     Dewey's assessment of general economic, market and monetary conditions.

     In preparing its opinion, McFarland Dewey assumed and relied on the
accuracy and completeness of all information supplied or otherwise made
available to McFarland Dewey, discussed with or reviewed by McFarland Dewey, or
publicly available. McFarland Dewey did not assume any responsibility for
independently verifying such information. McFarland Dewey has not undertaken an
independent evaluation or appraisal of any of the assets or liabilities of
Mediconsult or Cybear or been furnished with any such evaluation or appraisal.

     Additionally, McFarland Dewey assumed that:

   o Mediconsult would be unable to secure alternative financing in sufficient
     time to provide working capital to continue operations, and that if such
     financing was not obtained, Mediconsult would be unable to continue as a
     going concern in the absence of the consummation of the merger and would
     likely seek protection from creditors under the bankruptcy laws;

   o based on time constraints and Mediconsult's current circumstances, the
     merger is the best available transaction or course of action practically
     available that would address Mediconsult's liquidity and other financial
     concerns;

   o the information furnished to or discussed with McFarland Dewey by
     Mediconsult or Cybear has been prepared on a reasonable basis in
     accordance with industry practice and, with respect to financial planning
     data, reflects the best currently available estimates and judgment of
     Mediconsult's or Cybear's management as to the expected future financial
     performance of Mediconsult or Cybear, and that the management of
     Mediconsult or Cybear is not aware of any information or facts that would
     make the information provided to McFarland Dewey incomplete or misleading;

   o there have been no material changes in Mediconsult's assets, financial
     condition, results of operations, business or prospects since the date of
     the last financial statements or information made available to McFarland
     Dewey;

   o the merger will be accounted for as a purchase under generally accepted
     accounting principles and that it will qualify as a tax-free
     reorganization for U.S. federal income tax purposes; and

   o that the final form of the merger agreement would be substantially
     similar to the last draft reviewed by McFarland Dewey.

     The McFarland Dewey opinion is necessarily based upon market, economic and
other conditions as they existed on, and could be evaluated as of, the date of
such opinion. Other than as set forth in the draft merger agreement reviewed by
McFarland Dewey, McFarland Dewey assumed that no material third party approvals
regarding Mediconsult or Cybear with respect to any contracts or otherwise will
be necessary.

     McFarland Dewey reviewed and analyzed the proposed terms of the merger,
and observed that:

     o Following the merger, Mediconsult would be a wholly-owned subsidiary of
Andrx Corporation;

   o As a result of the merger, each issued and outstanding share of common
     stock of Mediconsult would be converted into the right to receive 0.1430
     shares of Cybear tracking stock, subject to the adjustment provided for in
     the merger agreement. If the maximum adjustment was made, the exchange
     ratio would be reduced to 0.1144.

     o Mediconsult had negative working capital of approximately $7,179,000 as
     of December 31, 2000;

   o Upon signing of the merger agreement, Cybear agreed to loan Mediconsult
     up to $2,000,000 with a maturity date of July 15, 2001;

   o Mediconsult's shares of common stock outstanding as of the consummation
     of the merger will increase to approximately 82,056,000 shares due to the
     conversion of existing Mediconsult liabilities to common stock; and

   o Total transaction value, based on 82,056,000 shares of outstanding
     Mediconsult common stock, was approximately $6,556,000.

     The following is a brief summary of the material analyses prepared by
McFarland Dewey in connection with the rendering of the McFarland Dewey
opinion.

     Stock Price History. To provide contextual data and comparative market
data, McFarland Dewey examined the history of the trading prices for both
Cybear tracking stock and Mediconsult common stock and their relative
relationships to each other for the latest twelve months and compared the
results to the NASDAQ Index and S & P 500 Index. This information was prepared
solely to provide background information regarding the stock prices of
Mediconsult and Cybear over the periods indicated below as both companies
similarly under-performed the two indices.

     Comparison of Selected Comparable Companies. McFarland Dewey compared the
trading multiples for Mediconsult to corresponding multiples of a select group
of e-health companies

consisting of Allscripts Inc, drkoop.com Inc., Drugstore.com Inc,
HealthCentral.com, HealthGate Data Corporation, Healthstream Inc,
Medicalogic/Medscape Inc, PlanetRX.com, Sciquest.com Inc, WebMD Corporation,
and Cybear. Based on its analysis, McFarland Dewey derived a summary reference
range of implied enterprise values of Mediconsult.

     The following table summarizes the results of McFarland Dewey's company
comparable analyses.

     The analysis indicated that, with the exception of Transaction Value to
Book Value, Mediconsult's implied multiples exceeded the low end of the range
of comparable multiples but were well below the adjusted average and median
multiples. None of the comparable companies is identical to Mediconsult.
Accordingly, an analysis of the results of the foregoing involves complex
considerations and judgments concerning differences in financial and operating
characteristics of the comparable companies and other factors that could
ultimately affect the value of Mediconsult.

     Analysis of Selected Comparable Transactions. McFarland Dewey reviewed
certain publicly available information regarding fifty-four select e-health
related acquisitions and calculated transaction value to last twelve months
sales multiples for such transactions. Due to the significant downturn in the
public markets at the end of March 2000, the fifty-four transactions were
separated into two groups; pre- and post-market downturn. Based on
Mediconsult's last twelve months negative EBIT and net income, McFarland Dewey
did not consider EBIT and net income to be a useful comparison.

     The following table summarizes the results of McFarland Dewey's analysis
of transactions comparable to the merger.

     The analysis indicated that Mediconsult's implied multiples were below the
low end of the range of comparable multiples. No company or transaction used in
the above analysis as a comparison was identical to Mediconsult. Accordingly,
an analysis of the results of the comparison is not purely mathematical; rather
it involves complex considerations and judgments concerning differences in
historical and projected financial and operating characteristics of the
comparable acquired companies and other factors that could affect the
acquisition value of such companies and Mediconsult.

     Discounted Cash Flow Analysis. As the future viability of Mediconsult as a
going concern is assumed to be in question beyond March 2001, McFarland Dewey
believes that a discounted cash flow analysis would not be a meaningful measure
of value or reference for comparative value.

     Earnings Per Share Analysis And Balance Sheet Effect. McFarland Dewey
reviewed the accretion or dilution that the merger would have on pro forma
earnings per share indicated by the projections prepared by the managements of
Mediconsult and Cybear and by the total annual expense reduction for the fiscal
year 2001, resulting from the merger. McFarland Dewey also reviewed the impact
that the merger would have on the projected pro forma balance sheet.

     McFarland Dewey has, in the past, provided financial advisory services to
Mediconsult in connection with its merger with Physicians' Online as well as in
connection with other transactions and received compensation for such services.
Pursuant to a letter dated December 26, 2000, Mediconsult has agreed to pay
McFarland Dewey a cash fee of $250,000 and 500,000 shares of Mediconsult common
stock upon the rendering of the fairness opinion. McFarland Dewey may provide
such services to the surviving corporation in the merger and/or its affiliates
and may receive fees for the rendering of such services.

     Additionally, Mediconsult agreed to reimburse McFarland Dewey for
reasonable out-of-pocket expenses, including, without limitation, reasonable
fees and disbursements of its legal counsel. Mediconsult has also agreed to
indemnify McFarland Dewey and certain related persons for certain liabilities
related to or arising out of its engagement, including liabilities under the
federal securities laws.

     Mediconsult retained McFarland Dewey based upon McFarland Dewey's
experience and expertise. McFarland Dewey, as part of its investment banking
business, is engaged in the valuation of businesses and securities in
connection with mergers and acquisitions, competitive bids, private placements
and valuations for corporate and other purposes.

Recommendation of Mediconsult's Board of Directors

     Mediconsult's board of directors believes that the merger is advisable,
fair to and in the best interests of Mediconsult and its stockholders and
unanimously recommends to its stockholders that they vote "FOR" the proposal to
adopt the merger agreement.

Interests of Certain Directors, Officers and Affiliates in the Merger

     Other than as described herein, no director or executive officer of
Mediconsult, and no associate of any such person, has any substantial interest,
direct or indirect, in the merger, other than an interest arising from the
ownership of Mediconsult common stock, in which case the director or officer
receives no extra or special benefit not shared on a pro rata basis by all
other holders of Mediconsult common stock.

     Certain members of Mediconsult's management and board of directors may be
deemed to have interests in the merger in addition to their interests as
stockholders of Mediconsult generally. In each case, the Mediconsult board of
directors either was aware of these factors or, with respect to interests that
arose subsequent to the signing of the merger agreement, was aware of their
potential, and considered them, among other matters, in approving the merger
agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby.

     Indemnification. The merger agreement provides that Andrx Corporation
shall for a period of four years after the effective time of the merger
indemnify, defend and hold harmless, to the fullest extent permitted under
applicable law, each present and former director, officer, employee, trustee
and agent of Mediconsult or any of its subsidiaries, including each person
controlling any of the foregoing persons, for any acts or omissions, or alleged
acts or omissions, by them in their capacities as such to

the extent they were indemnified by Mediconsult on the date of the merger
agreement. Andrx Corporation shall also maintain Mediconsult's existing
directors' and officers' liability insurance policies, or policies providing
terms at least as favorable as the existing policies, for a period of four
years after the effective time of the merger.

Description of Andrx Corporation Capital Stock

     Under Andrx Corporation's current capital structure, there are two classes
of common stock-- Andrx common stock and Cybear tracking stock. Specifically,
the Cybear tracking stock is common stock of Andrx that, unlike typical common
stock, is designed to track the financial performance of a specific group of
Andrx Corporation's business operations and related allocated assets, rather
than operations and assets of the entire company. For instance, operations and
assets dedicated to Andrx Corporation's Internet assets are referred to as
Cybear. Therefore, the Cybear tracking stock is not stock of Cybear, but rather
a class of Andrx Corporation's common stock containing special provisions
intended to tie the value of that stock primarily to the operations and assets
that it attributes to Cybear.

     The chief mechanism intended to cause the Cybear tracking stock to "track"
the financial performance of Cybear are special provisions in Andrx
Corporation's certificate of incorporation governing dividends and
distributions. The provisions governing dividends provide that Andrx
Corporation's board of directors has discretion to decide if and when to
declare dividends subject to certain limitations. Those limitations are
dependent, in part, upon the excess of earnings and paid-in capital or of the
fair value of the net assets allocated to Cybear over the outstanding Cybear
tracking stock's combined par value and amounts needed to satisfy preferences
and debt obligations allocated to the related division. Within these and other,
general limitations under the certificate of incorporation and Delaware law,
the amount of any dividend payment will be at the Andrx Corporation's board of
directors' discretion. When deciding whether to declare a dividend, and for how
much, the board of directors would consider, among other things, the earnings,
financial condition, capital requirements and level of indebtedness of Andrx or
Cybear, as the case may be. To date, Andrx Corporation has never paid or
declared a cash dividend on shares of any of its series of common stock, nor
does Andrx Corporation anticipate doing so in the foreseeable future. Unless
declared, dividends do not accrue on the Cybear tracking stock.

     Andrx Corporation aids investors in evaluating the net worth and earnings
performance of each of its groups by:

     o defining in its certificate of incorporation, those assets that will
initially comprise the group; and

   o publishing quarterly financial statements that break out the assets and
     liabilities and results of operations of each group for the reported
     periods.

The financial statements include audited annual and unaudited quarterly
financial statements and separate management's discussions and analysis for
each group division and Andrx Corporation. Andrx Corporation manages and
accounts for transactions between the groups and with third parties, and any
resulting re-allocations of assets and liabilities, by applying consistently
between the groups a detailed set of policies established by its board of
directors. The policies appear in Annex D of this proxy statement/prospectus.
With some exceptions contained in the policies, Andrx Corporation's board of
directors retains the discretion to revise the policies at any time, subject to
its fiduciary duties to stockholders.

     The separate financial statements do not represent any physical
segregation of assets among divisions or separate division accounts. They are
an accounting presentation only, for the purpose of permitting investors to
assess the financial performance of the operations and assets allocated to each
group.

     While the common stocks are designed to reflect a group's performance,
they remain common stocks of the entire company. Therefore, a holder of Cybear
tracking stock is a common stockholder

subject to the risks of investing in the business, assets and liabilities of
Andrx Corporation as a whole. For instance, the assets allocated to any group
are nonetheless subject to company-wide claims of creditors, product liability
plaintiffs and stockholder litigation. Also, in the event of Andrx
Corporation's liquidation, insolvency or similar event, a holder of Andrx
Corporation common stock would have no direct claim against the assets
allocated to the corresponding tracked group; a holder of common stock would
only have the rights of a common stockholder in the combined assets of Andrx
Corporation, subject also to Andrx Corporation's allocation of liquidation
units as discussed below under the heading "Liquidation."

     If the merger is approved, you will be exchanging your Mediconsult common
stock for Cybear tracking stock. A summary of the material terms of the Andrx
capital stock is set forth below. The summary is not complete. We encourage you
to read the certificate of incorporation which is attached as Annex C.

Authorized and Outstanding Shares

     The certificate of incorporation authorizes Andrx Corporation to issue
151,000,000 shares of capital stock as follows: 100,000,000 shares of a class
of common stock, designated as Andrx common stock, 50,000,000 shares of a class
of common stock, designated as Cybear tracking stock, and 1,000,000 shares of
preferred stock. Shares of each class of stock will have a par value of $0.001
per share. The board of directors will be able to issue shares of preferred
stock in series, without stockholder approval. As of February 9, 2001,
69,642,251 shares of Andrx common stock, 15,207,250 shares of the Cybear
tracking stock, and no shares of preferred stock were issued and outstanding.

Dividends

     Dividends on the Andrx common stock and dividends on the Cybear tracking
stock are limited to an amount not greater than the Available Dividend Amount
as defined in the certificate of incorporation for the relevant group.

     Delaware law limits the amount of distributions on capital stock to the
legally available funds, which are determined on the basis of the entire
company, and not only the respective groups. As a result, the amount of legally
available funds will reflect the amount of any net losses of each group, any
distributions on Andrx common stock, Cybear tracking stock or any preferred
stock and any repurchases of Andrx common stock, Cybear tracking stock or
certain preferred stock. Dividend payments on the Andrx common stock and on the
Cybear tracking stock could be precluded because legally available funds are
not available under Delaware law, even though the Available Dividend Amount
test for the particular relevant group was met. Andrx Corporation cannot assure
stockholders that there will be an Available Dividend Amount for either group.

     Subject to the prior payment of dividends on any outstanding shares of
preferred stock and the limitations described above, the board of directors is
able, in its sole discretion, to declare and pay dividends exclusively on the
Andrx common stock, exclusively on the Cybear tracking stock or on both, in
equal or unequal amounts. In making its dividend decisions, the board of
directors will not be required to take into account the relative Available
Dividend Amounts for the two groups, the amount of prior dividends declared on
either class, the respective voting or liquidation rights of either class or
any other factor.

Conversion and Redemption

     The certificate of incorporation permits the conversion or redemption of
Andrx common stock and Cybear tracking stock.

     Mandatory Dividend, Redemption or Conversion of Common Stock If
Disposition of Cybear Assets Occurs. If Andrx Corporation sells, transfers,
assigns or otherwise disposes of, in one

transaction or a series of related transactions, all or substantially all of
the properties and assets attributed to Cybear, Andrx Corporation is required,
except as described below, to:

   o pay a dividend in cash and/or securities or other property to the holders
     of the Cybear tracking stock having a fair value equal to the net proceeds
     of the disposition;

   o if the disposition involves all, but not merely substantially all, of
     such properties and assets, redeem all outstanding shares of the Cybear
     tracking stock for cash and/or securities or other property having a fair
     value equal to the net proceeds of the disposition;

   o if the disposition involves substantially all, but not all, of such
     properties and assets, redeem or exchange that number of whole shares of
     the class of Cybear tracking stock as have in the aggregate an average
     market value, during the period of ten consecutive trading days beginning
     on the 26th trading day immediately succeeding the consummation date,
     closest to the net proceeds of the disposition; and the redemption price
     will be cash and/or securities or other property having a fair value equal
     to such net proceeds; or

   o convert each outstanding share of Cybear tracking stock to a number of
     shares of Andrx common stock equal to 110% of the ratio of the average
     market value of one share of Cybear tracking stock to the average market
     value of one share of Andrx common stock during the 10-trading day period
     beginning on the 26th trading day following the disposition date.

     Andrx Corporation may only pay a dividend or redeem shares of common stock
as set forth above if it has legally available funds under Delaware law and the
amount to be paid to holders is less than or equal to the Available Dividend
Amount for the Cybear Group. Andrx Corporation is required to pay this dividend
or complete a redemption or conversion on or prior to the 95th trading day
following the disposition.

     For purposes of determining whether a disposition has occurred,
"substantially all of the properties and assets" attributed to Cybear means a
portion of such properties and assets:

   o that represents at least 80% of the then fair value of the properties and
     assets attributed to Cybear; or

   o from which were derived at least 80% of the aggregate revenues of Cybear
     for the immediately preceding 12 fiscal quarterly periods.

     The "net proceeds" of a disposition means an amount equal to what remains
of the gross proceeds of the disposition after any payment of, or reasonable
provision is made as determined by the board of directors for:

   o any taxes payable by Andrx Corporation or which would have been payable
     but for the utilization of tax benefits attributable to Andrx, in respect
     of the disposition or in respect of any resulting dividend or redemption;

   o any transaction costs, including, without limitation, any legal,
     investment banking and accounting fees and expenses; and

   o any liabilities of or attributed to Cybear, including, without
     limitation, any liabilities for deferred taxes, any indemnity or guarantee
     obligations incurred in connection with the disposition or otherwise, any
     liabilities for future purchase price adjustments and any preferential
     amounts plus any accumulated and unpaid dividends in respect of the
     preferred stock attributed to Cybear.

     Andrx Corporation may elect to pay the dividend or redemption price in
connection with a disposition either in the same form as the proceeds of the
disposition were received or in any other

combination of cash, securities or other property that the Andrx Corporation
board of directors determines will have an aggregate market value of not less
than the fair value of the net proceeds.

     The following illustration demonstrates the provisions requiring a
mandatory dividend, redemption or conversion if a disposition occurs. If:

   o 60 million shares of Andrx common stock and 30 million shares of Cybear
     tracking stock were outstanding,

   o the net proceeds of the disposition of substantially all, but not all, of
     the assets of Cybear equals $50 million,

   o the average market value of the Cybear tracking stock during the
     10-trading day valuation period was $2 per share and

   o the average market value of the Andrx common stock during the same
     valuation period was $100 per share,

then Andrx Corporation could do any of the following:

     (1) pay a dividend to the holders of shares of Cybear tracking stock equal
to:

                 net proceeds                 =     $50 million      =     $1.66 per share
- -------------------------------------------         --------------
       number of outstanding shares of               30 million
            Cybear tracking stock

     (2) redeem for $2 per share a number of shares of Cybear tracking stock
equal to:

         net proceeds         =     $50 million      =     25,000,000 shares
- ---------------------------         --------------
   average market value of            2 million
    Cybear tracking stock

     (3) convert each outstanding share of Cybear tracking stock into a number
of shares of Andrx common stock equal to:

            Average market value of
  1.1 x      Cybear tracking stock      =     1.1 x     $  2 per share     =     0.022 shares
            -------------------------                   ----------------
            Average market value of                     $100 per share
               Andrx common stock

     Exceptions to the Dividend, Redemption or Conversion Requirement if a
Disposition Occurs.  Andrx Corporation is not required to take any of the above
actions for any disposition of all or substantially all of the properties and
assets of Cybear in a transaction or series of related transactions that
results in Andrx Corporation receiving for such properties and assets primarily
equity securities of any entity which:

   o acquires such properties or assets or succeeds to the business conducted
     with such properties or assets or controls such acquiror or successor; and

   o is primarily engaged or proposes to engage primarily in one or more
     businesses similar or complementary to the businesses conducted by Cybear
     prior to the disposition, as determined by the board of directors.

     The purpose of this exception is to enable Andrx Corporation technically
to "dispose" of properties or assets of Cybear to other entities engaged or
proposing to engage in businesses similar or complementary to those of Cybear
without requiring a dividend on, or a conversion or redemption

of, Cybear tracking stock, so long as Andrx Corporation holds an equity
interest in that entity. A joint venture in which Andrx Corporation owns a
direct or indirect equity interest is an example of such an acquiror. Andrx
Corporation is not required to control that entity, whether by ownership or
contract provisions.

     Andrx Corporation is also not required to effect a dividend, redemption or
conversion if the disposition is:

   o of all or substantially all of its properties and assets in one
     transaction or a series of related transactions in connection with its
     dissolution, liquidation or winding up and the distribution of its assets
     to stockholders;

   o on a pro rata basis, such as in a spin-off, to the holders of all
     outstanding shares of Cybear tracking stock; or

     o made to any person or entity controlled by it, as determined by the
board of directors.

     Notices If Disposition of Group Assets Occurs. Not later than the 20th
trading day after the consummation of a disposition, Andrx Corporation will
announce publicly by press release:

     o the estimated net proceeds of the disposition;

     o the number of outstanding shares of the Cybear tracking stock; and

   o the number of shares of Cybear tracking stock into or for which
     convertible securities are then convertible, exchangeable or exercisable
     and the conversion, exchange or exercise price thereof.

     Not earlier than the 36th trading day and not later than the 40th trading
day after the consummation of the disposition, Andrx Corporation will announce
publicly by press release whether it will pay a dividend or redeem shares of
common stock with the net proceeds of the disposition or convert the Cybear
tracking stock into the Andrx common stock.

     Andrx Corporation is required to cause to be mailed to each holder of
shares of the Cybear tracking stock the additional notices and other
information required by the certificate of incorporation.

     Conversion of Cybear Tracking Stock at Andrx Corporation's Option at Any
Time. The Andrx Corporation board of directors may at any time after September
8, 2001, or at any time after a tax event occurs, convert each share of Cybear
tracking stock into a number of shares of Andrx common stock equal to a
percentage as set forth below of the ratio of the average market values of the
Cybear tracking stock to the Andrx common stock over a 20-trading day period.

 Any conversion date occurring after the following   Percentage of market value ratio of
 anniversary of the September 2000 reorganization    Cybear tracking stock to the Andrx
 and on or prior to the next such anniversary        common stock
- ---------------------------------------------------  ------------------------------------
 First ...........................................                   125%
 Second ..........................................                   120%
 Third ...........................................                   115%
 Fourth and Thereafter ...........................                   110%

     Andrx Corporation will calculate the ratio as of the fifth trading day
prior to the date it mails the conversion notice to holders. However, if a tax
event occurs at any time subsequent to the effective date, a factor of 100%
rather than the above percentages will be applied to the ratio of the average
market values. This means that the holders of the Cybear tracking stock will
not receive any premium in such conversion.

     "Tax event" means the receipt by Andrx Corporation of an opinion of its
tax advisors that, as a result of:

   o any amendment to, or change in, the laws or regulations interpreting such
     laws of the United States or any political subdivision or taxing
     authority, including any announced proposed change by an applicable
     legislative committee or its chair in such laws or by an administrative
     agency in such regulations, or

   o any official or administrative pronouncement, action or judicial decision
     interpreting or applying such laws or regulations,

it is more likely than not that for United States federal income tax purposes:

   o Andrx Corporation or its stockholders are, or, at any time in the future,
     will be subject to tax upon the issuance of shares of either Andrx common
     stock or Cybear tracking stock, or

   o Andrx common stock or Cybear tracking stock is not or, at any time in the
     future, will not be treated solely as stock of Andrx Corporation.

     These provisions allow Andrx Corporation the flexibility to recapitalize
the two classes of common stock into one class of common stock that would,
after such reorganization, represent an equity interest in all of its
businesses. The optional conversion or redemption could be exercised at any
future time if the Andrx Corporation board of directors determines that, under
the facts and circumstances then existing, an equity structure consisting of
two classes of common stock was no longer in the best interests of all of its
stockholders. Such exchange could be exercised, however, at a time that is
disadvantageous to the holders of one of the classes of common stock.

     Many factors could affect the market values of the Andrx common stock or
the Cybear tracking stock, including the results of operations of Andrx
Corporation and those of each of the groups, trading volume and general
economic and market conditions. Market values could also be affected by
decisions by the board of directors or management that investors perceive to
affect differently one class of common stock compared to the other. These
decisions could include changes to the management and allocation policies,
transfers of assets between groups, allocations of corporate opportunities and
financing resources between the groups and changes in dividend policies.

     The following illustration demonstrates the calculation of the number of
shares issuable upon conversion of Cybear tracking stock into shares of Andrx
common stock at Andrx Corporation's option between the second and third
anniversaries of the reorganization. If:

     o a tax event has not occurred,

   o 30 million shares of Cybear tracking stock and 60 million shares of Andrx
     common stock were outstanding immediately prior to a conversion,

   o the average market value of one share of the Cybear tracking stock over
     the 10-trading day valuation period was $2, and

   o the average market value of one share of Andrx common stock over the same
     valuation period was $100, then each share of Cybear tracking stock could
     be converted into 0.02 shares of Andrx common stock based on the following
     calculation:

  1.2 x     $  2      =     0.02 shares
            ----
            $100

     Redemption in Exchange for Stock of Subsidiary. The Andrx Corporation
board of directors may redeem on a pro rata basis all of the outstanding shares
of Andrx common stock or Cybear

tracking stock for shares of the common stock of one or more of its
wholly-owned subsidiaries which own all of the assets and liabilities
attributed to the relevant group. If at the time of any such redemption of
Andrx common stock, Andrx is entitled to Number of Cybear Designated Shares, as
defined in the certificate of incorporation, it will also issue an equal number
of shares of Cybear tracking stock either to (1) the holders of the Andrx
common stock or (2) one or more of those Andrx Corporation subsidiaries. Andrx
Corporation may redeem shares of common stock for subsidiary stock only if it
has legally available funds under Delaware law.

     These provisions are intended to give Andrx Corporation increased
flexibility with respect to spinning-off the assets of one of the groups by
transferring the assets of that group to one or more wholly-owned subsidiaries
and redeeming the shares of common stock related to that group in exchange for
stock of such subsidiary or subsidiaries. As a result of any such redemption,
holders of each class of common stock would hold securities of separate legal
entities operating in distinct lines of business. Such a redemption could be
authorized by the board of directors at any time in the future if it determines
that, under the facts and circumstances then existing, an equity structure
comprised of the Andrx common stock and the Cybear tracking stock is no longer
in the best interests of all of the stockholders as a whole.

     Selection of Shares for Redemption. If less than all of the outstanding
shares of a class of common stock are to be redeemed, Andrx Corporation will
redeem such shares proportionately from among the holders of outstanding shares
of such common stock or by such method as may be determined by its board of
directors to be equitable.

     Fractional Interests; Transfer Taxes. Andrx Corporation will not be
required to issue fractional shares of any capital stock or any fractional
securities to any holder of either class of common stock upon any conversion,
redemption, dividend or other distribution described above. If a fraction is
not issued to a holder, Andrx Corporation will pay cash instead of such
fraction.

     Andrx Corporation will pay all documentary, stamp or similar issue or
transfer taxes that may be payable in respect of the issue or delivery of any
shares of capital stock and/or other securities on conversion or redemption of
shares.

Voting Rights

     The certificate of incorporation provides that the entire voting power of
the stockholders will be vested in the holders of common stock, who will be
entitled to vote on any matter on which stockholders are entitled to vote,
except as otherwise required by the board of directors or provided by law or
stock exchange rules, by the terms of any outstanding preferred stock or by any
provision of the certificate of incorporation restricting the power to vote on
a specified matter to other stockholders. Holders of common stock will vote as
a single class on each matter on which holders of common stock are generally
entitled to vote.

     On all matters as to which both classes of common stock vote together as a
single class:

     o each share of Andrx common stock will have one vote; and

   o each share of Cybear tracking stock will have a number of votes equal to
     the quotient of the average market value of a share of Cybear tracking
     stock over the 20-trading day period ending on the 10th trading day prior
     to the record date for determining the holders of common stock entitled to
     vote, divided by the average market value of a share of Andrx common stock
     over the same period; provided, however, in the event the holders of the
     Cybear tracking stock shall hold in excess of 25% of the total voting
     power, the vote of Cybear tracking stock shall be reduced to represent 25%
     of the total voting power.

     Accordingly, the relative per share voting rights of the Andrx common
stock and the Cybear tracking stock will fluctuate depending on changes in the
relative market values of shares of such classes of common stock.

     The Andrx common stock currently has and Andrx Corporation expects that it
will continue to have a substantial majority of the voting power because it
expects that the aggregate market value of the outstanding shares of Andrx
common stock will be substantially greater than the aggregate market value of
the outstanding shares of Cybear tracking stock. As of the record date, the
holders of the Cybear tracking stock have less than 1% of the total voting
power of Andrx Corporation common stock.

     Andrx Corporation will set forth the number of outstanding shares of Andrx
common stock and Cybear tracking stock in its Annual Report on Form 10-K and
its Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q filed under the Exchange Act. Andrx
Corporation will disclose in any proxy statement for a stockholders' meeting
the number of outstanding shares and per share voting rights of the Andrx
common stock and the Cybear tracking stock.

     If shares of only one class of common stock are outstanding, each share of
that class will have one vote. If either class of common stock is entitled to
vote as a separate class with respect to any matter, each share of that class
will, for purpose of such vote, have one vote on such matter.

     Fluctuations in the relative voting rights of the Andrx common stock and
the Cybear tracking stock could influence an investor interested in acquiring
and maintaining a fixed percentage of the voting power of the stock to acquire
such percentage of both classes of common stock, and would limit the ability of
investors in one class to acquire for the same consideration relatively more or
less votes per share than investors in the other class.

     The holders of Andrx common stock and Cybear tracking stock will not have
any rights to vote separately as a class on any matter coming before the Andrx
Corporation stockholders, except for certain limited class voting rights
provided under Delaware law. In addition to the approval of the holders of a
majority of the voting power of all shares of common stock voting together as a
single class, the approval of a majority of the outstanding shares of the Andrx
common stock or the Cybear tracking stock, voting as a separate class, would be
required under Delaware law to approve any amendment to the certificate of
incorporation that would change the par value of the shares of the class or
alter or change the powers, preferences or special rights of the shares of such
class so as to affect them adversely. As permitted by Delaware law, the
certificate of incorporation provides that an amendment to the certificate of
incorporation that increases or decreases the number of authorized shares of
Andrx common stock or Cybear tracking stock will only require the approval of
the holders of a majority of the voting power of all shares of common stock,
voting together as a single class, and will not require the approval of the
holders of the class of common stock affected by such amendment, voting as a
separate class.

     The following illustration demonstrates the calculation of the number of
votes each share of Cybear tracking stock would be entitled on all matters on
which holders of Andrx common stock and Cybear tracking stock vote as a single
class.

     If the average market value for the 20-trading day valuation period was $2
for the Cybear tracking stock and $100 for the Andrx common stock, each share
of Andrx common stock would have one vote and each share of Cybear tracking
stock would have 0.02 votes based on the following calculation:

  $  2      =     0.02 votes
- ------
  $100

     Assuming 60 million shares of Andrx common stock and 30 million shares of
Cybear tracking stock were outstanding, the shares of Andrx common stock would
represent approximately 99% of the total voting power and the shares of Cybear
tracking stock would represent approximately 1% of the total voting power.

Liquidation

     Currently, in the event of a liquidation, dissolution or termination,
after payment, or provision for payment, of its debts and other liabilities and
the payment of full preferential amounts to which the

holders of any preferred stock are entitled, holders of existing Andrx common
stock and Cybear tracking stock are entitled to share equally in their
remaining net assets.

     The certificate of incorporation provides that in the event of a
dissolution, liquidation or winding up, after payment or provision for payment
of the debts and other liabilities and full preferential amounts to which
holders of any preferred stock are entitled, regardless of the group to which
such shares of preferred stock were attributed, the holders of Andrx common
stock and Cybear tracking stock will be entitled to receive the assets
remaining for distribution to holders of common stock on a per share basis in
proportion to the liquidation units per share of such class. Each share of
Andrx common stock has one liquidation unit. Each share of Cybear tracking
stock will have a number of liquidation units equal to the quotient of the
average market value of a share of Cybear tracking stock over the 20-trading
day period ending on the 40th trading day after the effective date of the
reorganization, divided by the average market value of a share of Andrx common
stock over the same period.

     After the number of liquidation units to which each share of Cybear
tracking stock is entitled has been calculated in accordance with this formula,
that number will not be changed without the approval of holders of the class of
common stock adversely affected. As a result, after the date of the calculation
of the number of liquidation units to which the Cybear tracking stock is
entitled, the liquidation rights of the holders of the respective classes of
common stock may not bear any relationship to the relative market values or the
relative voting rights of the two classes. Andrx Corporation's financial
advisors believe that, in general, these liquidation provisions are immaterial
to trading in the Andrx common stock and the Cybear tracking stock.

     No holder of Andrx common stock has any special right to receive specific
assets of Andrx and no holder of Cybear tracking stock has any special right to
receive specific assets of Cybear in the case of the dissolution, liquidation
or winding up of Andrx Corporation.

     If Andrx Corporation subdivides or combines the outstanding shares of
either class of common stock or declare a dividend or other distribution of
shares of either class of common stock to holders of such class of common
stock, the number of liquidation units of either class of common stock will be
appropriately adjusted, as determined by the board of directors, to avoid any
dilution in the aggregate, relative liquidation rights of any class of common
stock.

     Neither a merger nor consolidation of Andrx Corporation into or with any
other corporation, nor any sale, transfer or lease of all or any part of its
assets, will, alone, be deemed a liquidation or winding up of Andrx
Corporation, or cause its dissolution for purposes of these liquidation
provisions.

Determinations by the Board of Directors

     Any determinations made in good faith by the Andrx Corporation board of
directors under any provision described under "Description of Andrx common
stock and Cybear tracking stock," and any determinations with respect to any
group or the rights of holders of shares of either class of common stock, will
be final and binding on all of Andrx Corporation's stockholders, subject to the
rights of stockholders under applicable Delaware law and under the federal
securities laws.

Preemptive Rights

     Neither the holders of the Andrx common stock nor the holders of the
Cybear tracking stock have any preemptive rights or any rights to convert their
shares into any other securities of Andrx Corporation.

Cybear Designated Shares

     Andrx, in the future, may hold an equity interest in Cybear in the form of
"Number of Cybear Designated Shares" as a result of future contributions of
cash or property to Cybear described below.

The Andrx Corporation board of directors could create Number of Cybear
Designated Shares if it determines that (1) Cybear requires additional equity
capital to finance its business and (2) Andrx should supply that capital.

     Number of Cybear Designated Shares are authorized shares of Cybear
tracking stock that are not issued and outstanding, but which the board of
directors, pursuant to the management and allocation policies, may from time to
time issue without allocating the proceeds or other benefits of such issuance
to Cybear. The Number of Cybear Designated Shares are not eligible to receive
dividends and can not be voted.

     The Number of Cybear Designated Shares will initially be zero but from
     time to time will be:

   o adjusted as appropriate to reflect subdivisions and combinations of the
     Cybear tracking stock and dividends or distributions of shares of Cybear
     tracking stock to holders of Cybear tracking stock and other
     reclassifications of Cybear tracking stock;

   o increased by a number equal to the quotient obtained by dividing (1) the
     fair value of all cash or other property attributed to Andrx that is
     contributed to Cybear to increase the Number of Cybear Designated Shares
     by (2) the average market value of Cybear tracking stock over the
     20-trading day period immediately prior to the date of transfer;

   o decreased by a number equal to the quotient obtained by dividing (1) the
     fair value of all cash or other property attributed to Cybear that is
     contributed to Andrx to reduce the Number of Cybear Designated Shares by
     (2) the average market value of Cybear tracking stock over the 20-trading
     day period immediately prior to the date of contribution; and

   o decreased by the number of newly issued shares of Cybear tracking stock,
     the proceeds of which have been allocated to Andrx, or issued as a
     dividend or distribution or by reclassification, exchange or otherwise to
     holders of Andrx common stock.

Preferred Stock

     The Andrx Corporation board of directors is authorized to issue shares of
preferred stock at any time, without stockholder approval. It has the authority
to determine all aspects of those shares, including the following:

     o the designation and number of shares;

   o the dividend rate and preferences, if any, which dividends on that series
     of preferred stock will have compared to any other class or series of
     Andrx Corporation capital stock;

     o the voting rights, if any;

     o the conversion privileges, if any, applicable to that series;

   o the redemption price or prices and the other terms of redemption, if any,
     applicable to that series;

     o sinking fund provisions; and

     o the voluntary and involuntary liquidation preferences.

     Any of these terms could have an adverse effect on the availability of
earnings for distribution to the holders of Cybear tracking stock or for other
corporate purposes. Voting rights of holders of preferred stock could adversely
affect the voting power of stockholders of Cybear tracking stock,

Andrx common stock or both and could have the effect of delaying, deferring or
impeding a change of control of Andrx Corporation. This could protect the
continuity of Andrx Corporation's management and possibly deprive stockholders
of an opportunity to sell their shares at prices higher than the prevailing
market prices.

Description of Management and Allocation Policies

     Andrx Corporation's board of directors established policies to address a
number of issues with respect to the financing of Andrx and Cybear, competition
between groups, inter-group business transactions, corporate opportunities and
the allocation of debt, corporate overhead, interest, taxes and other charges
between the two groups. These policies establish charges between the two groups
on an objective basis and, except as described below, to ensure that
transactions between Andrx and Cybear are made on terms that approximate the
terms that could be obtained from unaffiliated third parties. We have included
these policies as Annex D.

     A summary of the management and allocation policies that are currently in
place are set forth below.

Policies Subject to Change without Stockholder Approval

     The board of directors may modify, rescind or make exceptions to these
policies, or may adopt additional policies, in its sole discretion without
stockholder approval. However, the board of directors has no present plans to
do so. A board of directors' decision to modify or rescind such policies, or
adopt additional policies could have different effects upon holders of Andrx
common stock and holders of Cybear tracking stock or could result in a benefit
or detriment to one class of stockholders compared to the other class. The
board of directors would make any such decision in accordance with its good
faith business judgment that such decision is in the best interests of Andrx
Corporation and all of its stockholders as a whole.

Interests to be Attributed to the Groups

     It is Andrx Corporation's intent to attribute to Cybear all of its
interests worldwide in Internet business related to the healthcare industry
other than any Internet business related to the marketing, manufacture,
purchase, warehousing, developing, sale and distribution of pharmaceuticals.
Accordingly, upon completion of the merger, Mediconsult will become part of
Cybear. All other of Andrx Corporation's interests not allocated to Cybear are
allocated to Andrx.

Fiduciary and Management Responsibilities

     Under Delaware law, absent an abuse of discretion, a director or officer
will be deemed to have satisfied his or her fiduciary duties to Andrx
Corporation and its stockholders if that person is disinterested and acts in
accordance with his or her good faith business judgment in the interests of
Andrx Corporation and all of the stockholders as a whole. The board of
directors in establishing policies with regard to intracompany matters such as
business transactions between groups and allocations of assets, liabilities,
debt, corporate overhead, taxes, interest, corporate opportunities and other
matters, will consider various factors and information which could benefit or
cause detriment to the stockholders of the respective groups and will make
determinations in the best interests of Andrx Corporation and all of the
stockholders as a whole.

Common Stock Ownership of Directors and Senior Officers

     As a policy, the Andrx Corporation board of directors will periodically
monitor the ownership of shares of Andrx common stock and shares of Cybear
tracking stock by its directors and senior officers and the options granted to
them so that their interests are generally aligned with the two classes of
common stock and with their duty to act in the best interests of Andrx
Corporation and the

stockholders as a whole. However, because of the differences in trading values
between Andrx common stock and Cybear tracking stock, the actual value of their
interests in Andrx common stock and Cybear tracking stock will vary
significantly. Accordingly, it is possible that directors or senior officers
could favor one group over the other due to their stock and option holdings.

Financing Activities

     Most financial and treasury activities are managed on a centralized basis.
These activities include but are not limited to the issuance and repayment of
short-term and long-term debt and the issuance and repurchase of any preferred
stock. If a transfer of cash or other property allocated to one group to the
other group occurs, Andrx Corporation will account for such transfer in one of
the following ways, as determined by its board of directors except as set forth
in a tax sharing agreement entered into by Andrx and Cybear:

   o As a short-term or long-term loan from one group to the other, or as a
     repayment of a previous borrowing, as described under "Inter-Group Loans"
     below;

   o As an increase or decrease in the Number of Cybear Designated Shares, as
     described under "Future Equity Contributions to be Reflected as Cybear
     Tracking Stock Designated Shares" below; or

     o As a sale of assets between the two groups.

     The board of directors has not adopted specific criteria to determine
which of the foregoing will be applied to a particular transfer of cash or
property from one group to the other. The board of directors will make these
determinations, either in specific instances or by setting applicable policies
generally, in the exercise of its business judgment based on all relevant
circumstances. All transfers of material assets from one group to the other
will be made on a fair value basis for the foregoing purposes, as determined by
the board of directors. See "Transfers of Assets Between Groups."

     Although debt and preferred stock may be allocated between groups, the
debt and preferred stock will remain obligations of Andrx Corporation and all
of its stockholders will be subject to the risks associated with those
obligations.

     Debt. Debt will be allocated between the groups or, in its entirety to a
particular group. If debt for a particular financing is allocated in its
entirety to one group, the interest rate, amortization, maturity, redemption
and other terms shall be on then prevailing terms on which Andrx Corporation
could borrow such funds. Any expense related to debt that is allocated in its
entirety to a group will be allocated in whole to that group.

     Preferred Stock. Preferred stock, if issued, will be allocated between the
groups or, if the board of directors so determines, in its entirety to a
particular group. If Andrx Corporation allocates preferred stock for a
particular financing in its entirety to one group, that group will be charged
the dividend cost. If the dividend cost is higher than Andrx Corporation's
actual cost, the other group will receive a credit for an amount equal to the
difference as compensation for the use of its credit capacity. Any expense
related to preferred stock that is allocated in its entirety to a group will be
allocated in whole to that group.

     Inter-Group Loans. Cash or other property that is allocated to one group
that is transferred to the other group, could, if so determined by the board of
directors, be accounted for either as a short-term loan or as a long-term loan.
The board of directors will establish the terms on which short-term and
long-term loans between the groups will be made, including interest rate,
amortization schedule, maturity and redemption terms. The terms, however, shall
reflect the then prevailing terms on which Andrx Corporation could borrow the
funds.

     Future Equity Contributions to be Reflected as Cybear Tracking Stock
Designated Shares. Cash or other property allocated to Andrx that is
contributed as additional equity to Cybear will increase the

Number of Cybear Designated Shares. Cash or other property allocated to Cybear
that is transferred to Andrx will, if so determined by the Andrx Corporation
board of directors, decrease the Number of Cybear Designated Shares.

     Equity Issuances and Repurchases and Dividends. All financial effects of
issuances and repurchases of shares of Andrx common stock or shares of Cybear
tracking stock will be reflected entirely in the financial statements of that
group except as described in the next sentence. All financial effects of
issuances of additional shares of Cybear tracking stock, which have been
reflected as a reduction in the Number of Cybear Designated Shares, will be
reflected entirely in the financial statements of Andrx Corporation. Financial
effects of dividends or other distributions on, and purchases of, shares of
Andrx common stock or Cybear tracking stock will be reflected entirely in the
respective financial statements of Andrx and Cybear.

Competition Between Groups

     Neither Andrx nor Cybear will engage in each other's principal businesses,
except for joint transactions with each other. Joint transactions may include
joint ventures or other collaborative arrangements to develop, market, sell and
support new products and services. Third parties may also participate in such
joint transactions. See "Transfers of Assets Between Groups--Joint
Transactions." The terms of any joint transactions will be determined by the
Andrx Corporation board of directors.

     The Andrx Corporation board of directors will make decisions whether to
permit indirect competition between the groups. Indirect competition could
occur if and when:

   o one group uses products of third parties in that group's products rather
     than using the other group's products;

   o a third party uses a product of one group in the third party's products
     which compete with the other group's products; or

   o a group licenses technology allocated to that group to a third party that
     is a competitor of the other group.

     The groups may compete in a business which is not a principal business of
the other group.

Transfers of Assets Between Groups

     The certificate of incorporation permits the transfer of assets between
groups without stockholder approval. All such transfers will be made at fair
value, as determined by Andrx Corporation's board of directors, except as
described below. The consideration for such transfers may be paid by one group
to the other in cash or other consideration, as determined by the board of
directors.

     The board of directors has adopted specific policies for the sale of
products and services between groups and joint transactions with each other and
third parties as set forth below.

     Sales of Products and Services Between Groups. A group will sell products
or services to the other group on terms that would be available from third
parties in commercial transactions. If terms for such transactions are not
available from a third party, the purchasing group will (1) pay for such
products at fair value as determined by the board of directors and (2) pay for
such services at fair value, as determined by Andrx Corporation's board of
directors, or at the cost, including overhead, of the selling group.

     Joint Transactions. The groups may from time to time engage in
transactions jointly, including with third parties, as described under
"Competition Between Groups." Research and development and other services
performed by one group for a joint venture or other collaborative arrangement
will be charged at fair value, as determined by the board of directors.

Review of Corporate Opportunities

     The board of directors reviews any matter which involves the allocation of
a corporate opportunity to either the Andrx common stock or the Cybear tracking
stock or in part to the Andrx common stock and in part to the Cybear tracking
stock. In accordance with Delaware law, the board of directors will make its
determination with regard to the allocation of any such opportunity and the
benefit of such opportunity in accordance with its good faith business judgment
of the best interests of Andrx Corporation and all of its stockholders as a
whole. Among the factors that the board of directors may consider in making
this allocation is whether a particular corporate opportunity is principally
related to the business of Andrx or Cybear; whether one group, because of its
managerial or operational expertise, will be better positioned to undertake the
corporate opportunity; and existing contractual agreements and restrictions.

Financial Statements

     Andrx Corporation prepares financial statements in accordance with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, consistently
applied, for Andrx and Cybear, and these financial statements, taken together,
comprise all of the accounts included in our corresponding consolidated
financial statements. The financial statements of each of Andrx and Cybear
reflect the financial condition, results of operations and cash flows of the
businesses included therein.

Allocation Matters

     Group financial statements also include allocated portions of Andrx
Corporation's debt, interest corporate overhead and costs of administrative
shared services and taxes. Andrx Corporation makes these allocations for the
purpose of preparing each group's financial statements; however, holders of
Andrx common stock and Cybear tracking stock will continue to be subject to all
of the risks associated with an investment in Andrx Corporation and all of its
businesses, assets and liabilities.

     In addition to allocating debt and interest as described above under
"Financing Activities" and assets as described above under "Transfers of Assets
Between Groups," Andrx Corporation's board of directors has adopted the
following allocation policies:

   o Direct Charges. Andrx Corporation allocates direct expenses incurred on
     behalf of a group to that group.

   o Corporate Overhead and Administrative Shared Services. Andrx Corporation
     allocates a portion of the corporate overhead to Andrx and Cybear based
     upon the use of services by that group. Corporate overhead includes costs
     of our executive management, payroll, human resources, legal, auditing,
     tax, mergers and acquisitions, treasury, and strategic planning functions.
     Andrx Corporation allocates in a similar manner a portion of the costs of
     administrative shared services, such as information technology services.
     Where determinations based on use alone are not practical, Andrx
     Corporation uses other methods and criteria that it believes is equitable
     and provides a reasonable estimate of the cost attributable to the groups.

   o Taxes. Andrx Corporation allocates the federal income tax provisions and
     related tax payments and refunds between the groups based on a tax sharing
     agreement.

Capital Stock Committee

     Andrx Corporation established a capital stock committee of the board of
directors as part of the September 2000 reorganization. Timothy Nolan was also
appointed as Cybear's designee on Andrx Corporation's board of directors.
Provided Mr. Nolan is a member of the board of directors, he will be a member
of the capital stock committee, however, in the event that he is a member of
the capital stock committee, the capital stock committee will have at least one
other member. The capital stock committee will have authority to:

   o Interpret, make determinations under, and oversee the implementation of
     these policies in order to resolve potential and actual conflicts between
     the groups.

   o Adopt additional general policies governing the relationship between
     Andrx and Cybear with respect to these policies; and

   o Engage the services of accountants, investment bankers, appraisers,
     attorneys and other service providers to assist in discharging its duties.

     The decisions of the capital stock committee will be subject to ultimate
approval of the board of directors.

Comparison of Stockholder Rights

     Following the merger, the rights of the Mediconsult stockholders will
cease to be governed by the existing certificate of incorporation and existing
bylaws of Mediconsult but will continue to be governed by Delaware law.
Instead, the rights of the Mediconsult stockholders will be governed by Andrx
Corporation's certificate of incorporation and bylaws.

     The following is a brief summary of the material ways in which the rights
of Mediconsult stockholders will change because of the merger.

Amendments to Certificate of Incorporation.

     Andrx Corporation's certificate of incorporation requires an affirmative
vote of the holders of at least a majority of all outstanding shares entitled
to vote at a meeting to amend its certificate of incorporation, except to amend
the provisions relating to directors, special meetings of stockholders,
stockholder action and bylaws which require a vote of at least two-thirds of
all outstanding shares entitled to vote without a meeting. Mediconsult's
existing certificate of incorporation requires an affirmative vote of the
holders of at least a majority of all outstanding shares entitled to vote at a
meeting to amend its certificate of incorporation, except any amendment
pertaining to the indemnification of officers and directors of Mediconsult,
which requires a vote of at least two-thirds of all outstanding shares entitled
to vote.

Amendments to Bylaws.

     Andrx Corporation's certificate of incorporation and bylaws both require
an affirmative vote of the holders of at least a majority of all outstanding
shares entitled to vote at a meeting to amend its bylaws, except the provisions
relating to directors, special meetings of stockholders, notice of stockholder
proposals and stockholder action without a meeting, which require a vote of at
least two-thirds of all outstanding share entitled to vote. Mediconsult's
existing certificate of incorporation requires a two-thirds vote of all
outstanding shares entitled to vote to amend the bylaws. Mediconsult's existing
bylaws require the affirmative vote of the majority of directors present at a
meeting of the board of directors at which a quorum is present to amend the
bylaws.

Number of Directors.

     Andrx Corporation's certificate of incorporation and bylaws provide that
the number of directors will not be less than three and not more than 12. The
certificate of incorporation also provides that the number of directors will be
fixed by resolution of the board of directors. Under Mediconsult's existing
bylaws, the number of directors will not be less than one and not more than 10
and provides that the number of directors will be fixed by resolution of the
board of directors.

Classified Board of Directors.

     Andrx Corporation's certificate of incorporation and bylaws provide for
the board of directors to be divided into three classes of directors serving
staggered terms. This results in approximately one-third of the directors being
elected each year. Mediconsult does not have a classified board of directors.

Removal of Directors.

     Andrx Corporation's certificate of incorporation and bylaws provide that a
director may only be removed for cause and by a two-thirds vote of all
outstanding shares entitled to vote. Mediconsult's existing bylaws provide that
a director may be removed with or without cause in a manner consistent with
Delaware corporation law.

Filing Newly Created Directorships and Vacancies.

     Under Delaware law, Andrx Corporation's bylaws and Mediconsult's bylaws,
whenever a vacancy occurs on the board of directors, including a vacancy
resulting from an increase in the number of directors, it may be filled by the
affirmative vote of a majority of the remaining directors, though less than a
quorum of directors, or by the stockholders, unless the certificate of
incorporation provide otherwise.

Business combinations with substantial stockholders.

     Delaware law contains a statutory provision which is intended to curb
abusive takeovers of Delaware corporations. Section 203 of the Delaware
Corporation Law addresses the problem by preventing certain business
combinations of the corporation with interested stockholders within three years
after such stockholders become interested. Section 203 provides, with certain
exceptions, that a Delaware corporation may not engage in any of a broad range
of business combinations with a person or an affiliate, or associate of such
person, who is an "interested stockholder" for a period of three years from the
date that such person became an interested stockholder unless:

   o the transaction resulting in a person becoming an interested stockholder,
     or the business combination, is approved by the board of directors of the
     corporation before the person becomes an interested stockholder;

   o the interested stockholder acquired 85% or more of the outstanding voting
     stock of the corporation in the same transaction that makes such person an
     interested stockholder (excluding shares owned by persons who are both
     officers and directors of the corporation, and shares held by certain
     employee stock ownership plans); or

   o on or after the date the person becomes an interested stockholder, the
     business combination is approved by the corporation's board of directors
     and by the holders of at least 66 2/3% of the corporation's outstanding
     voting stock at an annual or special meeting, excluding shares owned by
     the interested stockholder.

Under Section 203, an "interested stockholder" is defined as any person who is:

     o the owner of 15% or more of the outstanding voting stock of the
     corporation; or

   o an affiliate or associate of the corporation and who was the owner of 15%
     or more of the outstanding voting stock of the corporation at any time
     within the three year period immediately prior to the date on which it is
     sought to be determined whether such person is an interested stockholder.

Indemnification of directors and officers.

     Andrx Corporation's bylaws and Mediconsult's existing certificate of
incorporation provide that directors or officers be indemnified against any
liability (including any judgment, settlement, penalty or fine) incurred in
connection with any legal proceeding provided the director, officer or employee
acted in good faith and in a manner they reasonably believed to be in or not
opposed to the best interests of Andrx Corporation or Mediconsult,
respectively.

     Andrx Corporation's bylaws and Mediconsult's existing certificate of
incorporation generally provide that all reasonable expenses of the indemnified
director or officer be paid in advance of the final proceeding to the fullest
extent permitted by law.

Special Meetings of Stockholders.

     Under Delaware law, a special meeting of stockholders may be called by the
corporation's board of directors or by such persons as may be authorized by the
corporation's certificate of incorporation or bylaws.

     Andrx Corporation's bylaws provide that a special meeting may be called by
the chief executive officer, a majority of the board of directors or 33.3% of
the stockholders entitled to vote. Mediconsult's existing bylaws provide that a
special meeting may be called by its president, board of directors, the holders
of not less than one-tenth of all shares entitled to vote at the meeting, or
legal counsel.

Dissenter's Rights.

     Delaware law provides that dissenting stockholders who follow prescribed
statutory procedures are entitled to appraisal rights in the case of a merger
of a corporation, except that such rights are not provided when:

     o no vote of the stockholders is required for the merger; or

   o shares of the corporation are listed on a national securities exchange on
     the record date or held by more than 2,000 stockholders and are to be
     exchanged solely for shares of stock of another corporation which are
     listed on a national securities exchange or held by more than 2,000
     stockholders.

Certain Anti-Takeover Provisions

     Andrx Corporation's certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain
certain anti-takeover measures which are intended to protect the stockholders
by rendering it more difficult for a person or persons to obtain control of
Andrx Corporation without the cooperation of its management. The anti-takeover
provisions include an advance notice requirement for any stockholder proposals
or nominations for the election of a director and a provision for a staggered
board of directors.

     Andrx Corporation's bylaws provide that any stockholder proposals and
nominations for the election of directors be delivered to Andrx Corporation no
less than 60 days nor more than 90 days in advance of a meeting. However, in
the event that less than 70 days notice of the meeting is provided to the
stockholders, the stockholders must provide Andrx Corporation with its notice
no later than 10 days following the date Andrx Corporation's notice was made.
Such stockholder notice must contain (1) a brief description of the business
desired to be brought before the meeting and the reasons for conducting such
business at the annual meeting, (2) the name and record address of the
stockholder, (3) the class and number of shares of capital stock which are
beneficially owned by the stockholder and (4) any material interest of the
stockholder in such business. Mediconsult's bylaws do not contain such a
provision.

     The inclusion of such "anti-takeover" provisions in the Andrx Corporation
certificate of incorporation may delay, deter or prevent a takeover which the
stockholders may consider to be in their best interests, thereby possibly
depriving holders of Andrx's securities of certain opportunities to sell or
otherwise dispose of their securities at above-market prices, or limit the
ability of stockholders to remove incumbent directors as readily as the
stockholders may consider to be in their best interests.

United States Federal Income Tax Considerations

     The following discussion is a summary of the material U.S. federal income
tax consequences of the merger and reflects the opinion of Broad and Cassel.
The discussion is based on the Code, the

Treasury Department regulations promulgated under the Code, published positions
of the IRS, and court decisions now in effect, all of which are subject to
change, potentially with retroactive effect. In particular, Congress could
enact legislation or the Treasury Department could issue regulations affecting
the treatment of stock with characteristics similar to the Cybear tracking
stock.

     This discussion addresses only those stockholders who hold Mediconsult
common stock as a capital asset and will, after the merger, hold Cybear
tracking stock as a capital asset. However, this discussion does not address
the Mediconsult stockholders who were creditors of Mediconsult and have
exchanged their claims against Mediconsult for Mediconsult common stock in
anticipation of exchanging the Mediconsult common stock for Cybear tracking
stock. This discussion does not discuss all aspects of U.S. federal income
taxation that may be relevant to stockholders in light of their particular tax
circumstances. In particular, this discussion does not address the U.S. federal
income taxation of stockholders subject to special treatment under the Code,
such as the following:

     o Tax-exempt entities;

     o Partnerships, S corporations, or other pass-through entities;

     o Mutual funds and regulated investment companies;

     o Small business investment companies;

     o Insurance companies and other financial institutions;

     o Broker-dealers and dealers in securities;

     o Traders that mark their positions to market;

   o Stockholders who hold their shares as part of a hedge, appreciated
     financial position, straddle, or conversion transaction;

   o Stockholders who acquired their shares through the exercise of options or
     otherwise as compensation or through a tax-qualified retirement plan;

     o Individuals who are not citizens or residents of the U.S.;

     o Estates and trusts not subject to U.S. federal income tax; and

     o Foreign corporations and other foreign entities.

     Finally, this discussion does not address any consequences under state,
local or foreign tax laws.

Mediconsult stockholders should consult with their own tax advisors with regard
to the application of the federal income tax laws, as well as to the
applicability and effect of any state, local or foreign tax laws to which you
may be subject.

     Andrx Corporation has obtained an opinion from Broad and Cassel regarding
the material U.S. federal income tax consequences of the merger, which is based
on the law in effect on the date this proxy statement/prospectus is filed with
the SEC. The opinion from Broad and Cassel is being filed with the SEC as an
exhibit to this proxy statement/prospectus. The opinion relies on factual
assumptions, including an assumption that there have been no changes in
existing facts, that the Cybear tracking stock will be issued in accordance
with the certificate of incorporation, that cash paid for fractional shares and
to pay dissenting stockholders does not exceed 20% of the total merger
consideration, and that the merger will be completed in accordance with the
merger agreement. The opinion also relies on representations contained in
certificates furnished to Broad and Cassel by

officers of Andrx Corporation in connection with Broad and Cassel rendering its
opinion. If any of these assumptions or representations are inaccurate, the
conclusions contained in the opinion could be affected. Moreover, the opinion
of Broad and Cassel is not binding on the IRS, and there can be no assurance
that views expressed in the opinion, if challenged, would be sustained in
court.

     Broad and Cassel is of the opinion that the Cybear tracking stock should
be treated as voting common stock of Andrx Corporation for U.S. federal income
tax purposes.

     No advance ruling has been sought from the IRS on the U.S. federal income
tax consequences of the merger, including the classification of the Cybear
tracking stock. The IRS has announced that it will not issue any advance
rulings on the classification of an instrument that has certain voting and
liquidation rights in an issuing corporation but whose dividend rights are
determined by reference to the earnings of a segregated portion of the issuing
corporation's assets, including assets held by a subsidiary. Broad and Cassel's
opinion is not binding on the IRS. In addition, there are no court decisions or
other authorities that bear directly on the treatment of stock with
characteristics similar to the Cybear tracking stock. It is possible, therefore
that the IRS could successfully take the position that:

   o The Cybear tracking stock is stock of a separate corporation and not
     capital stock of Andrx Corporation.

     o The receipt of Cybear tracking stock is a taxable event to Mediconsult
stockholders.

     The IRS could also attempt to recharacterize certain indebtedness of
Mediconsult as equity, which recharacterization could affect the tax
consequences of the merger. If the IRS were to prevail, the merger may not be
tax-free and each Mediconsult stockholder could recognize gain or loss equal to
the difference between the (i) fair market value of the Cybear tracking stock
received in the transaction (as of the merger date) and (ii) such stockholder's
adjusted tax basis in the Mediconsult common stock surrendered.

     Broad and Cassel, however, is of the opinion that the IRS should not
prevail in any of the above assertions. Accordingly, the discussion below of
the material U.S. federal income tax consequences of the merger to Mediconsult
stockholders, assumes that the Cybear tracking stock will be treated as voting
common stock of Andrx Corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes and that
any debt of Mediconsult will not be recharacterized as equity.

     The material U.S. federal income tax consequences to Mediconsult's
stockholders are as follows:

   o The merger of Andrx Corporation's wholly-owned subsidiary into
     Mediconsult with Mediconsult surviving the merger should qualify as a
     reorganization within the meaning of Sections 368(a)(1)(A) and (a)(2)(E)
     of Code.

   o Each Mediconsult stockholder should recognize no gain or loss as a result
     of the exchange of Mediconsult common stock solely for shares of Cybear
     tracking stock pursuant to the merger under Section 354(a)(1) of the Code,
     except with respect to any cash received by a Mediconsult stockholder
     instead of a fractional share of Cybear tracking stock.

   o Each Mediconsult stockholder should have a tax basis in the shares of
     Cybear tracking stock received in the merger equal to the tax basis of the
     Mediconsult common stock surrendered in the merger less any tax basis
     attributable to a fractional share of Cybear tracking stock for which cash
     is received.

   o Each Mediconsult stockholder's holding period for shares of Cybear
     tracking stock received in the merger should include the stockholder's
     holding period for the Mediconsult common stock exchanged therefor.

   o If any Mediconsult stockholder receives cash instead of a fractional
     share of Cybear tracking stock, the stockholder should recognize capital
     gain or loss equal to the amount of cash received less the amount of basis
     allocated to the fractional share interest. The gain or loss will be
     long-term capital gain or loss if the share of Mediconsult common stock
     exchanged for the fractional share of Cybear tracking stock was held for
     more than one year at the effective time of the merger, except that if
     Mediconsult is determined to be a "collapsible corporation", any gain
     recognized by a Mediconsult stockholder who directly or indirectly has
     ever owned more than 5% of the outstanding stock of Mediconsult may be
     treated as ordinary income.

   o Any Mediconsult stockholder who receives cash as a result of exercising
     appraisal rights, if any, will generally recognize capital gain or loss
     equal to the amount of cash received less such stockholder's tax basis in
     the Mediconsult common stock provided that such cash payment is not
     treated as a dividend for U.S. federal income tax purposes. The gain or
     loss will be long-term capital gain or loss if the share of Mediconsult
     common stock was held for more than one year at the effective time of the
     merger, except that if Mediconsult is determined to be a "collapsible
     corporation", any gain recognized by a Mediconsult stockholder who
     directly or indirectly has ever owned more than 5% of the value of the
     outstanding stock of Mediconsult, may be treated as ordinary income.
     Generally, a disposition of Mediconsult common stock pursuant to an
     exercise of appraisal rights will not be treated as a dividend if the
     stockholder exercising such rights does not own, directly or indirectly,
     any Andrx common stock or Cybear tracking stock immediately after the
     merger.

     The foregoing is not intended to be a complete analysis or description of
all potential U.S. federal income tax consequences or any other consequences of
the merger. In addition, this discussion does not address tax consequences
which may vary with, or are contingent on, your individual circumstances.
Moreover, this discussion does not address any non-income tax or any foreign,
state or local tax consequences of the merger. Accordingly, you are strongly
urged to consult with your tax advisor to determine the particular U.S.
federal, state, local or foreign income or other tax consequences to you of the
merger.

Principal Provisions of the Merger Agreement

     Set forth below is a description of the material terms of the merger
agreement. We urge stockholders to carefully read, in its entirety, the merger
agreement, which we have attached as Annex A to this proxy statement/prospectus
and incorporated into this document by reference. If there is any discrepancy
between the terms of the merger agreement and the following summary, the merger
agreement will control.

General

     The merger agreement contemplates that a wholly-owned subsidiary of Andrx
Corporation will merge with and into Mediconsult, with Mediconsult surviving
the merger and becoming part of Cybear. The merger will become effective on the
date and time that the certificate of merger is filed with the Delaware
Secretary of State or such other date and time specified in the certificate of
merger.

Conversion of Shares and Consideration to be Received in the Merger

     At the effective time of the merger:

   o each issued and outstanding share of Mediconsult common stock, other than
     treasury stock owned by Mediconsult, shares held by Andrx Corporation or
     any of its subsidiaries or shares held by persons entitled to appraisal
     rights, if any, will be converted into the right to receive 0.1430 shares
     of Cybear tracking stock, subject to adjustment as described below;

   o each outstanding stock option under the Mediconsult stock option plans
     and each Mediconsult warrant will be converted into separately exercisable
     options and warrants to acquire the

     number of shares of Cybear tracking stock equal to the product of the
     number of Mediconsult common stock that were issuable upon exercise
     multiplied by 0.1430, subject to adjustment as described below; and

   o the exercise price for the shares of Cybear tracking stock issuable upon
     exercise of the assumed Mediconsult options and warrants will be equal to
     the quotient determined by dividing the existing exercise price of the
     Mediconsult option or Mediconsult warrant by 0.1430, subject to adjustment
     as described below;

Adjustment to the Consideration to be Received in the Merger

     The number of shares the Mediconsult stockholders will receive is subject
to an adjustment. By approving the merger agreement, the Mediconsult
stockholders agree that 20% of the total number of shares of Cybear tracking
stock that may be issued to them will not be issued until after the effective
date of the merger. These shares will be issued, subject to an adjustment, if
any, once a balance sheet as of the closing date of the merger is agreed upon
by Andrx Corporation and Mediconsult. By approving the merger agreement, the
Mediconsult stockholders also agree to appoint Ian D. Sutcliffe as the
representative of the Mediconsult stockholders with respect to the adjustment.

     Within 90 days after the closing date, Andrx Corporation will present to
Mr. Sutcliffe a closing balance sheet as of the closing date audited by Andrx
Corporation's independent certified public accountants. For each $250,000 by
which Mediconsult's stockholder equity amount exceeds the Mediconsult
stockholder equity amount set forth in the merger agreement, the 0.1430
exchange ratio for each share of Mediconsult common stock will be adjusted
downward by 0.0128 of a share of Cybear tracking stock up to a maximum of
0.0286 of a share of Cybear tracking stock. Therefore, the exact number of
shares of Cybear tracking stock the Mediconsult stockholders will receive may
be less than 11,731,459 but not less than 9,385,723.

     Mr. Sutcliffe, as the Mediconsult stockholders' representative, will
handle any and all disputes relating to the adjustment. The remaining shares of
Cybear tracking stock will be distributed to the Mediconsult stockholders once
the adjustment amount has been agreed to.

of Merger Sub."

Principal Covenants

     Voting Agreements. Pursuant to the merger agreement, Mediconsult agreed to
obtain an agreement from Robert A. Jennings, a director and principal
stockholder, and JHC Limited, an entity controlled by Mr. Jennings, to vote in
favor of the merger.

     Interim Financing. In connection with the merger agreement, Andrx
Corporation agreed to cause Cybear Inc. to provide Mediconsult with up to
$2,000,000 in interim financing to fund Mediconsult's operating activities
until the closing date or the termination of the merger agreement. See "Interim
Financing" on page 87 for a further discussion of the interim financing.

     Conduct of Business Pending the Merger. Pursuant to the merger agreement,
Mediconsult has agreed that, until the effective time of the merger, subject to
certain exceptions, Mediconsult will carry on business in the same manner as
conducted prior to the date of the merger agreement.

     No Solicitation of Transactions. Pursuant to the merger agreement,
Mediconsult has agreed that it will not solicit, initiate, encourage or take
any action which would facilitate a takeover proposal or engage in negotiations
with or disclose any nonpublic information or give access to its properties,
books of records to any person who is considering making or has made a takeover
proposal. However, Mediconsult's board of directors are not prohibited from
taking and disclosing to its stockholders a position with respect to an
unsolicited tender offer pursuant to Rules 14d-9 and 14e-2 promulgated under
the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.

     In addition, Mediconsult may engage in any of the otherwise prohibited
acts referred to above, other than soliciting, initiating or encouraging any
takeover proposal, if:

     o its board of directors receives an unsolicited takeover proposal;

   o its board of directors believes in good faith after receiving advice from
     a reputable financial advisor that the unsolicited takeover proposal is
     reasonably capable of being consummated and

     would, if consummated, be reasonably likely to result in a transaction
     more favorable than the merger to the Mediconsult stockholders;

   o its board of directors determines in good faith that the failure to
     entertain and consider an unsolicited takeover proposal which is believed
     to be superior could reasonably be deemed to be inconsistent with its
     fiduciary duties to the Mediconsult stockholders under applicable law; and

   o it notifies Andrx Corporation of its receipt of a takeover proposal and
     any determination by its board of directors and delivers to Andrx
     Corporation a copy of the proposal, or a summary of any oral proposals,
     and all documents containing or referring to non-public information about
     it that are supplied to the third party making such takeover proposal.

     Mediconsult has also agreed not to agree to endorse, and will not permit
any of its officers, directors, employees or other representatives to agree to
or endorse, any takeover proposal or withdraw its recommendation of the merger
agreement and merger unless its board of directors believes in good faith,
after receiving advice from a reputable financial advisor, that such action is
required in order for its board of directors to comply with its fiduciary
duties to stockholders under applicable law and Mediconsult has terminated the
merger agreement. Mediconsult will also notify Andrx Corporation within 24
hours after its receipt of any takeover proposal and keep Andrx Corporation
fully informed of the status and details of such takeover proposal.

     Mediconsult has agreed to notify Andrx Corporation of any receipt of any
notice that any person is considering making a takeover proposal or any request
for nonpublic information or access to its properties, books or records by any
person considering making or that has made a takeover proposal and is required
to keep Andrx Corporation fully informed of the status and details of any such
notice, request, correspondence or communications.

     Insurance and Indemnification. The merger agreement provides that Andrx
Corporation, for four years after the effective time of the merger, shall
indemnify, to the fullest extent permitted under applicable law but no more
than currently provided by Mediconsult, past or current officer, director,
employee, trustee or agent of Mediconsult against all amounts paid in
connection with any claim pertaining to acts or omissions in their capacities
before or after the effective time. In addition, Andrx Corporation shall
reimburse indemnified parties for reasonable fees and expenses in bringing any
action to enforce rights or to collect money due under the merger agreement.

     The merger agreement also provides that, for four years after the
effective time of the merger, Andrx Corporation shall maintain or shall cause
to be maintained, directors and officers liability insurance on terms at least
as favorable as Mediconsult's directors and officers liability insurance
policies in effect prior to the effective date of the merger.

     Assumption of Stock Options. At the effective time of the merger, Andrx
Corporation will assume all outstanding options to purchase Mediconsult common
stock.

     Assumption of Warrants. Prior to the effective time of the merger, Andrx
Corporation will assume all outstanding Mediconsult warrants.

     Other Covenants. The merger agreement contains additional covenants,
including covenants relating to:

     o notices and consents;

     o preparation, filing and distribution of this proxy statement/prospectus;

     o cooperation regarding filings with governmental and other agencies and
   organizations;

     o coordination of the Mediconsult stockholders' meeting;

     o access to information;

     o notice of developments;

     o tax filings and tax opinions; and

     o press releases.

     In addition, the merger agreement contains a general covenant requiring
each party to use its reasonable best efforts to effect the consummation of the
merger.

     Conditions. The merger will be completed only if certain conditions are
satisfied or waived, including the following:

   o the merger agreement has been adopted by the vote of the holders of a
     majority of the outstanding shares of Mediconsult common stock;

   o the SEC shall have declared the registration statement on Form S-4
     effective and no stop order suspending its effectiveness shall have been
     issued and no proceeding for that purpose, and no similar proceeding, with
     respect to this proxy statement/prospectus shall have been initiated or
     threatened in writing by the SEC; and

     o there shall be no court order that prohibits the merger.

     Andrx Corporation's obligation to complete the merger is subject to the
satisfaction or waiver of each of the following additional conditions before
completion of the merger:

   o Mediconsult's representations and warranties must be true and correct
     when made and as of the closing of the merger.

   o Mediconsult must have complied with and performed in all material
     respects all of its covenants under the merger agreement;

     o there shall not have been a material adverse effect on Mediconsult;

   o Andrx Corporation must have been provided with a certificate executed on

     Corporation ; and

     o There shall not have been a material adverse effect on Andrx

     Termination of the Merger Agreement. At any time prior to the completion
of the merger, the merger agreement may be terminated under the following
circumstances if the terminating party is authorized to do so by its board of
directors:

     o By mutual written consent of Andrx Corporation and Mediconsult;

     o By either Andrx Corporation or Mediconsult, if:

     o Without any fault on the part of the terminating party, the closing
        does not occur on or before May 15, 2001;

     o There shall be a final nonappealable order of a court preventing the
        consummation of the merger or there shall be a law, statute, rule,
        regulation or order enacted or issued which has the effect of making
        the merger illegal;

     o The merger agreement has not been adopted by the vote of the holders of
        a majority of the outstanding shares of Mediconsult common stock;

     o By Andrx Corporation, if:

     o Mediconsult breaches any of its representations, warranties or
        covenants to the extent that it would cause the conditions to closing
        not to be satisfied, and the breach is not cured within 30 days of the
        receipt by Mediconsult of notice of the breach;

     o The Mediconsult board of directors withdraws or modifies its
        recommendation of the merger agreement or the merger in a manner
        adverse to Andrx Corporation or resolves to do so;

     o The Mediconsult board of directors recommends, endorses, accepts or
        agrees to a takeover proposal or resolves to do so; or

     o Mediconsult solicits, initiates, encourages or agrees to any takeover
        proposal or engages in any negotiations with, discloses any non-public
        information relating to Mediconsult or any of its subsidiaries to, or
        affords access to the properties, books or records of Mediconsult to,
        any person that has advised Mediconsult that it may be considering
        making, or that has made, a takeover proposal, or Mediconsult otherwise
        breaches the non-solicitation provisions of the merger agreement.

     o By Mediconsult, if:

     o Andrx Corporation breaches any of its representations, warranties or
        covenants to the extent that it would cause the conditions to closing
        not to be satisfied, and the breach is not cured within 30 days
        following the receipt by Andrx Corporation of written notice of the
        breach; or

     o After receiving the unsolicited takeover proposal, Mediconsult's board
        of directors, in compliance with the procedures set forth in the merger
        agreement, determines in good faith that such takeover proposal is
        superior to the merger and that it is required by its fiduciary duty to
        accept such takeover proposal and advises Andrx Corporation of such
        action.

     Payment of Fees and Expenses. Whether or not the merger is consummated,
subject to certain exceptions discussed in this proxy statement/prospectus, all
costs and expenses incurred in connection with the merger agreement and the
merger will be paid by the party incurring the expense except that expenses
incurred in connection with filing and printing the proxy statement/prospectus
and the registration statement, and registration and filing fees incurred in
connection with the proxy statement/
prospectus and the registration statement shall be shared equally.

     If the merger agreement is terminated because:

   o of fraud or the willful or intentional breach or failure to perform by
     Andrx Corporation or Mediconsult of any of its representations, warranties
     or covenants in the merger agreement or the breakup warrant, the purpose
     of which is to terminate the merger agreement;

then the breaching party will pay the other party a termination fee of $750,000
within five business days from the termination of the merger agreement.

     If the merger agreement is terminated because:

   o The closing does not occur on or before May 15, 2001 because Mediconsult
     fails to satisfy a closing condition;

   o The merger agreement has not been adopted by the vote of the holders of a
     majority of the outstanding shares of Mediconsult common stock; or

   o After receiving an unsolicited takeover proposal, Mediconsult's board of
     directors, in compliance with the procedures set forth in the merger
     agreement, determines in good faith that such takeover proposal is
     superior to the merger and that it is required by its fiduciary duty to
     accept such takeover proposal and advises Andrx Corporation of such
     action; or

   o the Mediconsult board of directors changes or withdraws or modifies its
     recommendation of the merger agreement or the merger in an adverse manner;
     and

   o by January 9, 2002, (i) Mediconsult sells the capital stock of its
     wholly-owned subsidiary, Physicians' Online, Inc. or substantially all of
     Physicians' Online's assets, or (ii) the transaction substantially
     contemplated by the superior proposal is consummated, or (iii) Mediconsult
     closes a financing transaction or series of financing transactions with
     net proceeds equal to or greater than $7,500,000;

then Mediconsult will pay Andrx Corporation a termination fee of $1,000,000,
and will issue a breakup warrant to purchase up to 19.9% of the then
outstanding capital stock of Mediconsult within five business days of the
consummation of any transaction described above. For so long as the Mediconsult
common stock is traded on the Nasdaq National Market, the maximum number of
shares of Mediconsult common stock issuable pursuant to the breakup warrant,
the warrant issued in connection with the interim financing discussed below,
and upon conversion of the note below, is limited to 19.9% of Mediconsult's
issued and outstanding common stock. The breakup warrant is exercisable at a
price of $0.125 per share and is exercisable at any time after Mediconsult
becomes obligated to pay the $1,000,000 termination fee until one year from the
termination of the merger agreement.

     If the merger agreement is terminated because:

   o Either party breaches any of its representations, warranties, covenants
     or obligations in the merger agreement to the extent that the breach
     causes a condition to closing not to be satisfied and the breach is not
     cured within 30 days following receipt by the other party of written
     notice of the breach;

then the breaching party will pay to and reimburse the non-breaching party for
all actual out-of-pocket expenses incurred by the non-breaching party in
connection with the merger agreement and the transactions contemplated by the
merger agreement within five business days from the breaching party's receipt of
a statement from the non-breaching party indicating the amount of such
out-of-pocket expenses that have been incurred. In addition, if the merger
agreement is terminated as a result of a nonwillful material breach or failure
to perform related to one of the foregoing reasons for termination by the
breaching party, the non-breaching party will have the right to recover any
damages arising from such non-willful material breach or failure to perform.

Interim Financing

     On January 9, 2001, Mediconsult and Physicians' Online entered into a
credit agreement with Cybear Inc. whereby Cybear Inc. agreed to provide
Mediconsult with interim financing not to exceed $2,000,000. The interim
financing is to be used by Mediconsult to fund its and Physicians' Online's
operating activities until the closing date. The credit agreement shall be due
and payable on July 15, 2001 and contains the customary representations,
warranties, covenants, conditions and events of default.

     The interim financing is evidenced by a note. If the merger agreement is
terminated, the note is convertible into Mediconsult common stock at a
conversion price equal to $0.125 at any time. If the Mediconsult common stock
is still listed for trading on the Nasdaq National Market, the note is
convertible into no more than 19.9% of the then outstanding shares of
Mediconsult common stock. The note contains registration rights and
antidilution adjustments, including adjustments for issuances of shares at less
than the conversion price.

     The interim financing is secured by a pledge of all of Physicians'
Online's outstanding common stock as evidenced by a pledge agreement and a
security interest in all of Physicians' Online's assets as evidenced by a
security agreement.

     In connection with the credit agreement, Mediconsult issued to Cybear Inc.
a warrant to purchase 8,926,502 shares of Mediconsult common stock at an
exercise price of $0.125 per share. The warrant is only exercisable in the
event the merger agreement is terminated and will be exercisable until January
9, 2006. The warrant contains registration rights and the customary
antidilution adjustments, including adjustments for issuances of shares at less
than the exercise price.

Appraisal Rights

     Mediconsult is a Delaware corporation. If the Cybear tracking stock is not
listed for trading on the Nasdaq National Market on the effective date of the
merger, Mediconsult's stockholders will have the right to an appraisal of the
value of their Mediconsult common stock. If the Cybear tracking stock is listed
for trading on the Nasdaq National Market on the effective date of the merger,
the Mediconsult stockholders will have no appraisal rights.

     If appraisal rights exist under Section 262 of the Delaware General
Corporation Law, any holder of Mediconsult common stock who does not wish to
accept the merger consideration may dissent from the merger and elect to have
the fair value of the stockholder's shares of Mediconsult common stock
(exclusive of any element of value arising from the accomplishment or
expectation of the merger) judicially determined and paid to the stockholder in
cash, together with a fair rate of interest, if any, provided that the
stockholder complies with the provisions of Section 262 of the Delaware General
Corporation Law. The following discussion is not a complete statement of the
law pertaining to appraisal rights under Delaware law, and is qualified in its
entirety by the full text of Section 262, which is provided in its entirety as
Annex E to this proxy statement/prospectus and assumes appraisal rights exist.
All references in Section 262 and in this summary to a "stockholder" are to the
record holder of the shares of Mediconsult common stock as to which appraisal
rights are asserted. A person having a beneficial interest in shares of common
stock held of record in the name of another person,

such as a broker or nominee, must act promptly to cause the record holder to
follow properly the steps summarized below and in a timely manner to perfect
appraisal rights.

     Under Section 262, where a proposed merger is to be submitted for approval
at a meeting of stockholders, as in the case of the special meeting, the
corporation, not less than 20 days prior to the meeting, must notify each of
its stockholders entitled to appraisal rights that the appraisal rights are
available and include in the notice a copy of Section 262. This proxy
statement/prospectus shall constitute the notice to the holders of common
stock, and the applicable Delaware law provisions are attached to this proxy
statement/prospectus as Annex E. Any stockholder who wishes to exercise
appraisal rights or who wishes to preserve the right to do so should review
carefully the following discussion and Annex E to this proxy
statement/prospectus because failure to comply with the procedures specified in
Section 262 timely and properly will result in the loss of appraisal rights.
Moreover, because of the complexity of the procedures for exercising the right
to seek appraisal of the common stock, Mediconsult believes that stockholders
who consider exercising these rights should seek the advice of counsel.

     Any holder of common stock wishing to exercise the right to dissent from
the merger and demand appraisal under Section 262 must satisfy each of the
following conditions:

   o The stockholder must deliver to Mediconsult a written demand for
     appraisal of the stockholder's shares before the vote on the merger
     agreement at the special meeting, which demand will be sufficient if it
     reasonably informs Mediconsult of the identity of the stockholder and that
     the stockholder intends thereby to demand the appraisal of the holder's
     shares.

   o The stockholder must not vote its shares of common stock in favor of the
     merger agreement. Because a proxy which does not contain voting
     instructions will, unless revoked, be voted in favor of the merger
     agreement, a stockholder who votes by proxy and who wishes to exercise
     appraisal rights must vote against the merger agreement or abstain from
     voting on the merger agreement.

   o The stockholder must continuously hold the shares from the date of making
     the demand through the effective time of the merger. Accordingly, a
     stockholder who is the record holder of shares of common stock on the date
     the written demand for appraisal is made but who thereafter transfers the
     shares prior to the effective time of the merger will lose any right to
     appraisal in respect of that stockholder's shares. Neither voting (in
     person or by proxy) against, abstaining from voting on or failing to vote
     on the proposal to adopt the merger agreement will constitute a written
     demand for appraisal within the meaning of Section 262. The written demand
     for appraisal must be in addition to and separate from any such proxy or
     vote.

     Only a holder of record of shares of common stock issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the effective time of the merger is entitled to assert
appraisal rights for the shares of common stock registered in that holder's
name. A demand for appraisal should be executed by or on behalf of the
stockholder of record, fully and correctly, as that stockholder's name appears
on the stock certificates, should specify the stockholder's name and mailing
address, the number of shares of common stock owned and that the stockholder
intends thereby to demand appraisal of the stockholder's common stock. If the
shares are owned of record in a fiduciary capacity, such as by a trustee,
guardian or custodian, execution of the demand should be made in that capacity,
and if the shares are owned of record by more than one person as in a joint
tenancy or tenancy in common, the demand should be executed by or on behalf of
all owners. An authorized agent, including one or more joint owners, may
execute a demand for appraisal on behalf of a stockholder; however, the agent
must identify the record owner or owners and expressly disclose the fact that,
in executing the demand, the agent is acting as agent for the owner or owners.
A record holder such as a broker who holds shares as nominee for several
beneficial owners may exercise appraisal rights with respect to the shares held
for one or more beneficial owners while not exercising these rights with
respect to the shares held for other beneficial owners; in that case, the
written demand should set forth the number of shares as to

which appraisal is sought, and where no number of shares is expressly mentioned
the demand will be presumed to cover all shares held in the name of the record
owner. Stockholders who hold their shares in brokerage accounts or other
nominee forms and who wish to exercise appraisal rights are urged to consult
with their brokers to determine the appropriate procedures for the making of a
demand for appraisal by a nominee.

     A stockholder who elects to exercise appraisal rights under Section 262
should mail or deliver prior to the special meeting a written demand to:
Mediconsult.com, Inc., 560 White Plains Road, Tarrytown, New York 10591,
Attention: Secretary.

     Within 10 days after the effective time of the merger, the surviving
corporation must send a notice as to the effectiveness of the merger to each
former Mediconsult stockholder who has made a written demand for appraisal in
accordance with Section 262 and who has not voted in favor of the merger
agreement. Within 120 days after the effective time of the merger, but not
thereafter, either the surviving corporation or any dissenting stockholder who
has complied with the requirements of Section 262 may file a petition in the
Delaware Chancery Court demanding a determination of the value of the shares of
common stock held by all dissenting stockholders. Mediconsult is under no
obligation to and has no present intent to file a petition for appraisal, and
stockholders seeking to exercise appraisal rights should not assume that the
surviving corporation will file such a petition or that the surviving
corporation will initiate any negotiations with respect to the fair value of
such shares. Accordingly, stockholders who desire to have their shares
appraised should initiate any petitions necessary for the perfection of their
appraisal rights within the time periods and in the manner prescribed in
Section 262. Inasmuch as Mediconsult has no obligation to file such a petition,
the failure of a stockholder to do so within the period specified could nullify
that stockholder's previous written demand for appraisal. In any event, at any
time within 60 days after the effective time (or at any time thereafter with
the written consent of Mediconsult), any stockholder who has demanded appraisal
has the right to withdraw the demand and to accept payment of the merger
consideration. Under the merger agreement, Mediconsult has agreed that, except
with the prior written consent of Andrx Corporation, it will not voluntarily
make any payment with respect to, or offer to settle, or settle, any such
purchase demand.

     Within 120 days after the effective time of the merger, any stockholder
who has complied with the provisions of Section 262 to that point in time will
be entitled to receive from the surviving corporation, upon written request, a
statement setting forth the aggregate number of shares not voted in favor of
the merger agreement and with respect to which demands for appraisal have been
received and the aggregate number of holders of these shares. The surviving
corporation must mail the statement to the stockholder within 10 days of
receipt of the request or within 10 days after expiration of the period for
delivery of demands for appraisals under Section 262, whichever is later.

     A stockholder timely filing a petition for appraisal with the Delaware
Chancery Court must deliver a copy to the surviving corporation, which will
then be obligated within 20 days to provide the Delaware Chancery Court with a
duly verified list containing the names and addresses of all stockholders who
have demanded appraisal of their shares. After notice to these stockholders,
the Delaware Chancery Court is empowered to conduct a hearing on the petition
to determine which stockholders are entitled to appraisal rights. The Delaware
Chancery Court may require stockholders who have demanded an appraisal for
their shares and who hold stock represented by certificates to submit their
certificates to the Register in Chancery for notation thereon of the pendency
of the appraisal proceedings, and if any stockholder fails to comply with the
requirement, the Delaware Chancery Court may dismiss the proceedings as to that
stockholder.

     After determining the stockholders entitled to an appraisal, the Delaware
Chancery Court will appraise the "fair value" of their shares, exclusive of any
element of value arising from the accomplishment or expectation of the merger,
together with a fair rate of interest, if any, to be paid upon the amount
determined to be the fair value. The costs of the action may be determined by
the Delaware Chancery Court and taxed upon the parties as the Delaware Chancery
Court deems

equitable. Upon application of a dissenting stockholder, the Delaware Chancery
Court may also order that all or a portion of the expenses incurred by any
stockholder in connection with the appraisal proceeding, including, without
limitation, reasonable attorneys' fees and the fees and expenses of experts, be
charged pro rata against the value of all of the shares entitled to appraisal.

     Stockholders considering seeking appraisal should be aware that the fair
value of their shares as determined under Section 262 could be more than, the
same as or less than the merger consideration they would receive under the
merger agreement if they did not seek appraisal of their shares. Stockholders
should also be aware that investment banking opinions are not opinions as to
fair value under Section 262.

     In determining fair value and, if applicable, a fair rate of interest, the
Delaware Chancery Court is to take into account all relevant factors. In
Weinberger v. UOP, Inc., the Delaware Supreme Court discussed the factors that
could be considered in determining fair value in an appraisal proceeding,
stating that "proof of value by any techniques or methods that are generally
considered acceptable in the financial community and otherwise admissible in
court" should be considered, and that "fair price obviously requires
consideration of all relevant factors involving the value of a company." The
Delaware Supreme Court stated that, in making this determination of fair value,
the court must consider market value, asset value, dividends, earnings
prospects, the nature of the enterprise and any other facts that could be
ascertained as of the date of the merger that throw any light on future
prospects of the merged corporation. In Weinberger, the Delaware Supreme Court
stated that "elements of future value, including the nature of the enterprise,
that are known or susceptible of proof as of the date of the merger and not the
product of speculation, may be considered." Section 262 provides that fair
value is to be "exclusive of any element of value arising from the
accomplishment or expectation of the merger."

     Any stockholder who has duly demanded an appraisal in compliance with
Section 262 will not, after the effective time of the merger, be entitled to
vote the shares subject to the demand for any purpose or be entitled to the
payment of dividends or other distributions on those shares (except dividends
or other distributions payable to holders of record of shares as of a record
date prior to the effective time of the merger).

     Any stockholder may withdraw its demand for appraisal and accept the
merger consideration by delivering to the surviving corporation a written
withdrawal of the stockholder's demand for appraisal, except that (1) any such
attempt to withdraw made more than 60 days after the effective time of the
merger will require written approval of the surviving corporation and (2) no
appraisal proceeding in the Delaware Chancery Court shall be dismissed as to
any stockholder without the approval of the Delaware Chancery Court, and such
approval may be conditioned upon such terms as the Delaware Chancery Court
deems just. If the surviving corporation does not approve a stockholder's
request to withdraw a demand for appraisal when such approval is required or if
the Delaware Chancery Court does not approve the dismissal of an appraisal
proceeding, the stockholder would be entitled to receive only the appraised
value determined in any such appraisal proceeding, which value could be lower
than the value of the merger consideration.

     If, after the effective time of the merger, the shares of a dissenting
stockholder shall lose their status of dissenting share, Andrx Corporation
shall issue and deliver, upon surrender by such stockholder of the certificates
representing shares of Mediconsult common stock, the number of shares of Cybear
tracking stock to which such stockholder would otherwise be entitled to under
the merger agreement.

     Failure to comply strictly with all of the procedures set forth in Section
262 will result in the loss of a stockholder's statutory appraisal rights, if
available. Consequently, any stockholder wishing to exercise appraisal rights
is urged to consult legal counsel before attempting to exercise such rights.

Accounting Treatment

     The acquisition of Mediconsult will be accounted for by Andrx Corporation
as a purchase of a business. Under this method of accounting, the assets and
liabilities of Mediconsult acquired will be recorded at their fair value, and
any excess of Andrx Corporation's purchase price over the fair value will be
accounted for as goodwill, which will be amortized over no more than five years
years and allocated to Cybear.

Stock Exchange Listings

     Cybear tracking stock is quoted on the Nasdaq National Market under the
symbol "CYBA." Mediconsult common stock is quoted on the Nasdaq National Market
under the symbol "MCNS." Both Cybear tracking stock and Mediconsult common
stock may, however, be delisted from the Nasdaq National Market for failure to
meet the requirements for continued listing. See "Price Range of Existing
Common Stocks and Dividend Information" on pages 47 to 48.

Stock Transfer and Exchange Agent

     American Stock Transfer & Trust Company, the transfer agent for the Cybear
tracking stock, will act as the exchange agent for the merger.

Exchange Procedures

     Upon consummation of the merger, the transfer agent will mail to all
holders of outstanding Mediconsult common stock a letter of transmittal and
instructions for surrendering their stock certificates of Mediconsult common
stock. Upon proper surrender of such stock certificates, the Mediconsult common
stock will be exchanged for 80% of the shares of Cybear tracking stock to be
issued to the Mediconsult stockholders. Shortly after the merger, the
Mediconsult stockholders will be mailed stock certificates representing their
shares of Cybear tracking stock. Once Andrx Corporation and Mediconsult agree
on a balance sheet dated as of the closing date of the merger and any resulting
adjustment, stockholders will be mailed stock certificates representing their
remaining Cybear tracking stock shares, if any.

Financial Advisor

     McFarland Dewey is acting as Mediconsult's sole advisor with respect to
the merger. Mediconsult agreed to pay McFarland Dewey a fee of $250,000 and
500,000 shares of Mediconsult common stock.

     Mediconsult has also agreed to reimburse McFarland Dewey for its
reasonable out-of-pocket expenses, including the fees and expenses of their
lawyers, and to indemnify them against liabilities under the Securities Act and
certain other liabilities.

               MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF CONDITION
                   AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OF MEDICONSULT

Introduction

     Mediconsult uses the Internet to educate and connect doctors and patients.
Its Web communities and interactive solutions educate physicians, educate
patients and enable more effective doctor-patient relationships. Mediconsult
provides relevant tools, reliable services and quality medical information,
that save doctors time and improve health outcomes for their patients.

     Mediconsult's focus is on the chronic medical conditions that are
responsible for the majority of healthcare spending. By fostering communities
centered on prevalent medical conditions and health issues, Mediconsult
believes that it creates significant opportunities for pharmaceutical and other
healthcare companies to effectively reach physician and patient audiences using
Internet-based educational, marketing and sponsorship programs.

Background

     For the period from the inception of Mediconsult's operations in April
1996 through January 1997, its operating activities related primarily to the
initial development of the mediconsult.com website and operating
infrastructure, and the recruitment of employees. Since the launch of
mediconsult.com in 1996, Mediconsult focused on developing and organizing
content in an easy to navigate format, and improving the functionality of
mediconsult.com. During that time, Mediconsult added new sites through
subsequent acquisitions including cyberdiet.com and heartinfo.com, and new
Internet-based healthcare tools through the acquisition of Mood Sciences.

     In the third quarter of 1999, Mediconsult expanded its focus on long-term
strategic relationships with major pharmaceutical manufacturers to include
other Internet-based initiatives in addition to marketing programs. The initial
relationship in this new strategic direction was entered into with
Bristol-Myers Squibb Company in which Mediconsult is working with Bristol-Myers
to develop innovative new approaches to electronic medical education.

     In December 1999, Mediconsult expanded its focus to include a secure
physicians-only service through the acquisition of Physicians' Online, Inc.
Physicians' Online is an Internet online service that provides medical
information, communications, and a transactions network for physicians. It is a
secure, physicians-only environment featuring access to medical databases,
daily medical news, continuing medical education credits, clinical symposia,
e-mail accounts, Internet, discussions with colleagues, secure prescription
transactions, market research and recruiting services, among other services.
Membership is free.

     In February 2000, Mediconsult acquired Web Northstar Interactive, Corp., a
company that specializes in research evaluation. As consideration for the
acquisition, Mediconsult issued approximately 435,000 shares of common stock
for an aggregate price of $2.8 million.

     In March 2000, Mediconsult acquired Storknet, a company dedicated to
pregnancy and parenting issues. As consideration for the acquisition it issued
approximately 34,000 shares of common stock for an aggregate price of $0.2
million.

     In July 2000, Mediconsult announced expense reductions resulting in a
restructuring plan targeted primarily at its consumer website operations as
part of an overall evaluation of potential cost savings. This restructuring
plan highlights Mediconsult's shift toward building its physician community and
developing product offerings for its pharmaceutical clients. Management
believes that the reductions will result in savings of approximately $1 million
per month. The majority of expense reductions are targeted at those business
units that are stand-alone consumer channels. The expense reductions reduced
Mediconsult's headcount by approximately 100 employees, about 45% of the total
workforce at September 30, 2000.

Revenue Sources

     Mediconsult's main sources of revenue have historically been through
services related to the development and support of online education marketing
and sponsorship programs for pharmaceutical and other healthcare companies.
These services continue to be a source of revenue for Mediconsult and typically
include the design, development and management of customized websites relating
to particular pharmaceutical or other health-related products. These services
also include marketing research, focus group testing and online testing of
visitors' preferences. Revenue from these services is recognized on the basis
of contractual commitments over the period of each engagement using the
percentage-of-completion method, based on labor hours and costs incurred as the
measure of progress towards completion. Revenue from support services,
principally the management of websites that Mediconsult develops for its
clients, is recognized ratably over the periods services are provided,
generally on a monthly basis. Payments received from clients prior to the
performance of client services are recorded as unearned revenue.

     Mediconsult also provides advertising services involving the sale of
advertising space on certain websites it owns, manages or sponsors. These
services can be provided separately or as part of a more comprehensive suite of
services provided to its clients. Advertising services include banner
advertisements, polls, surveys, registration programs, coupons and other
interactive forms of advertising. Revenue from advertising sales is recognized
ratably over the period in which the advertisement is displayed, if no
significant obligations remain. In certain cases, advertising revenue from the
sale of advertising space is related to the delivery of impressions or
click-throughs from pages viewed by visitors to its websites. In these cases,
Mediconsult may guarantee a minimum number of impressions or click-throughs by
visitors over a specific period of time. To the extent that revenue is related
to the number of impressions or click-throughs, Mediconsult defers recognition
of this revenue until the required impressions or click-throughs are achieved.
Payments received from advertisers prior to displaying their advertisements are
recorded as deferred revenue. Mediconsult does not recognize revenue from
barter transactions with respect to its advertising services.

     As noted above, in the third quarter Mediconsult expanded its focus on
long term strategic relationships with major pharmaceutical manufacturers to
include other Internet-based initiatives in addition to marketing programs. The
initial relationship in this new strategic direction was entered into with
Bristol-Myers Squibb in which Mediconsult is working with Bristol-Myers to
develop innovative new approaches to electronic medical education. Mediconsult
is currently in the proposal stages for similar relationships with additional
major pharmaceutical companies.

     Mediconsult also derives revenue from licensing content and providing
website support to healthcare and other organizations. These client
organizations make Mediconsult content available to visitors to its websites or
to websites of their clients. Revenue from content licensing is recognized over
the period of the license. In certain cases, Mediconsult designs and develops
these websites. The portion of licensing revenue related to up-front customized
design work is recognized over the period that the work is performed. In
certain cases, Mediconsult realizes additional revenue from management of the
website or its content. Revenue from management services is recognized ratably
over the period the services are performed, generally on a monthly basis.
Mediconsult may also retain the right to place advertising on a website that
hosts its content.

     Although Mediconsult has certain electronic commerce alliances with
merchants of healthcare-oriented books and products, revenue from these
revenue-sharing arrangements has not been material. Revenue from Mediconsult's
share of the proceeds from electronic commerce partners' sales is recognized by
Mediconsult upon notification from its commerce partners of sales attributable
to its websites.

Marketing and Sales Initiatives

     In late 1997, Mediconsult initiated its first significant marketing and
advertising program. Mediconsult was engaged by Novartis Consumer Health Canada
to develop a comprehensive on-line smoking cessation program for its Habitrol
brand, focused on Canadian consumers. Mediconsult developed the website for
this program during early 1998, for which it received payment as services were
performed. Mediconsult receives revenue for maintaining and upgrading this
program, beginning with its launch in June 1998, and receives monthly
advertising revenue for referring visitor traffic to the Habitrol website.
Mediconsult recently expanded the Habitrol program to provide French and
professional healthcare versions of the website.

     Mediconsult has also generated revenue from developing programs for a
number of branded pharmaceutical products for Novartis Pharma, the worldwide
pharmaceutical division of Novartis. Mediconsult is developing a custom version
of an electronic medical education product for Bristol-Myers Squibb. In 1998,
revenue from Novartis and Bristol-Myers Squibb represented $0.7 million or 65%
total revenue. In the twelve months ended December 31, 1999, revenue from
Novartis and Bristol-Myers Squibb represented $5.0 million or 76% of
Mediconsult's total revenue. In the nine months ended September 30, 2000,
revenue from Bristol-Myers Squibb and Eli Lilly Company represented $12.5
million or 72% of our total revenue. The loss of Bristol-Myers Squibb as a
customer or any changes to the existing relationship that are less favorable to
Mediconsult, or any significant reduction in traffic on or through the
Physicians' Online website, will materially and adversely affect Mediconsult's
business, financial condition and results of operations.

     To date, Mediconsult's revenue has been generated primarily by its own
internal sales organization, Pharma Marketing, LLC and, to a lesser extent, by
third party advertising representatives. As of September 30, 2000, Mediconsult
had an internal marketing, sales, program design and product development
organization of 87 professionals. Mediconsult believes that it needs to
increase further the size of its internal marketing and sales organization in
order for it to execute successfully its growth strategy and, accordingly,
Mediconsult intends to hire additional marketing and sales professionals in
2001.

Visitor Traffic

     To improve the depth and breadth of Mediconsult's medical content and to
increase visitor traffic, in 1998 through September 2000, Mediconsult completed
strategic initiatives to purchase, manage or sponsor the following websites and
companies:

   o PharmInfo.com, a leading website providing information on pharmaceutical
     products and clinical trials for pharmacists, physicians and consumers.

     o Inciid.org, a website providing information on infertility.

     o Cyberdiet.com, a website providing tailored nutritional information and
     programs.

   o Heartinfo.org, a leading website that provides high quality content and
     tools focused on heart disease and related areas that have attracted a
     large and growing number of visitors to the www.heartinfo.com website.

   o Mood Sciences, Inc., a company that specializes in mental health disease
     management innovations.

   o POL.net, the flagship site of Physicians' Online, a company with more
     authenticated doctor-users than any other medical website.

     o Web Northstar Interactive Corp., a company specializing in online
research products.

     o Storknet, a website dedicated to pregnancy and parenting issues.

     As a consequence of the July 2000 decision to discontinue its consumer
businesses, Mediconsult initiated efforts in the third quarter of 2000 to sell
its consumer oriented assets. To date, Mediconsult has successfully sold
substantially all of the assets of Cyber-Tech, Inc., Cyberdiet, Inc., and the
Storknet Website. The sale of the Mood Sciences, Inc. assets is currently
pending.

Corporate

     Mediconsult was originally incorporated under the laws of the State of
Colorado in October 1989. In April 1996, it purchased Mediconsult.com Limited,
a Bermuda corporation, through a merger in which Mediconsult.com Limited became
a wholly-owned subsidiary of Mediconsult. In December 1996, Mediconsult
consummated a reincorporation merger pursuant to which it became a Delaware
corporation.

     Mediconsult conducts business primarily through Mediconsult.com Limited,
its Bermudan subsidiary. In addition to Mediconsult.com Limited, Mediconsult
has established subsidiaries in the United States, Canada and the United
Kingdom. Mediconsult's operations are conducted by Mediconsult.com Limited,
which has obtained an exemption from all Bermudan income taxes until the year
2016. Mediconsult.com Limited has, however, entered into service agreements
with other subsidiaries of Mediconsult for their employees to provide services
to Mediconsult.com Limited. These subsidiaries will be subject to income taxes
in their jurisdictions. Mediconsult.com Limited may be deemed to be doing
business in the United States and thereby become subject to US taxation.

Stock Options and Warrants

     Mediconsult expenses stock options granted to employees over their vesting
period, based on their fair value at the date of grant, under Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No. 123 "Accounting For Stock-Based
Compensation." The fair value of options and warrants granted to non-employees
for services provided are expensed over the period the services are performed
in accordance with EITF 96-18, "Accounting for Equity Instruments That Are
Issued to Other Than Employees for Acquiring, or in Conjunction with Selling,
Goods or Services."

     Pursuant to an agreement dated July 28, 1998 with Arnhold and S.
Bleichroeder, Inc. to provide Mediconsult with investment advisory services,
Mediconsult has issued to Arnold and S. Bleichroeder 100,000 shares of common
stock and warrants to purchase an aggregate of 400,000 shares of common stock
with an exercise price of $1.22 per share, which was the closing price of
Mediconsult's common stock on the contract date. Of this amount, warrants for
200,000 shares of common stock were delivered upon the initial filing of a
prospectus and warrants for 200,000 shares of common stock were deliverable in
2000, if certain conditions were met. Warrants for 100,000 shares were
delivered on March 15, 2000. Delivery of the warrants will result in the
recognition of an expense in the statement of operations equal to the fair
value of the warrants on the date of delivery in accordance with EITF 96-18
"Accounting for Equity Instruments That Are Issued to Other Than Employees for
Acquiring, or in Conjunction with Selling Goods or Services." At September 30,
2000, Mediconsult determined that the final 100,000 warrant shares will not
vest.

     On March 23, 2000 the Company and Accenture, formerly known as Andersen
Consulting LLP, entered into a warrant agreement under which Mediconsult issued
Accenture warrants to purchase 1,503,425 shares of Mediconsult's common stock
at an exercise price of $3.8125 per share in connection with consulting
services rendered by Accenture to Mediconsult under a consulting services
agreement signed on September 10, 1999. The warrants have a term of five years
and vest over time,

based upon consulting services performed by Accenture on Mediconsult's behalf.
In connection with the issuance of these warrants, Mediconsult reserved
1,503,425 shares of common stock issuable upon exercise of these warrants.

     During the quarter ended September 30, 2000, Mediconsult offered employees
an opportunity to cancel existing option grants in exchange for new, re-priced
option awards. The re-pricing offer was for the same number of shares
cancelled; however, vesting of the re-priced options began at the new grant
date, and vesting of the new options does not automatically accelerate upon a
change in control of Mediconsult. Of those eligible for the re-pricing, 3
accepted the offer, representing 104,500 option shares. The re-pricing was
effective August 7, 2000. The net affect on the second quarter option expense
as a result of the re-pricing was an increase of $3,641.

     As a result of Mediconsult's restructuring, many participants in
Mediconsult's employee stock option plan were no longer eligible to participate
in the plan, and some or all of those employees' outstanding option grants were
forfeited. The expense previously incurred relative to the issuance of these
option grants which were forfeited by certain employees was reversed in the
same period of the employees' termination, resulting in a credit balance for
the quarter ended September 30, 2000.

Results of Operations

     Revenue. Revenue consists of fees received for the design, development and
implementation of online marketing and advertising programs, including website
development and implementation, advertising services, licensing our content and
website support. Revenue was $0.3 million for the year ended December 31, 1997,
$1.0 million for the year ended December 31, 1998, an increase of 233% over the
prior year, and $6.4 million for the year ended December 31, 1999, an increase
of 540% over the prior year. Revenue was $17.3 million for the nine months
ended September 30, 2000 and $3.7 million for the nine months ended September
30, 1999, an increase of 365%. The period-to-period growth in revenue was
primarily attributable to acquisitions, an increase in the number of clients,
the number of marketing and advertising programs developed and implemented for
those clients and Mediconsult's newly introduced initiatives focused on the
delivery of electronic medical education over the Internet.

     Product And Content Development. Product and content development costs
include expenses incurred by Mediconsult to develop, enhance, manage, monitor
and operate its websites and to develop new products such as electronic medical
education and related products. Prior to 1997, these costs consisted primarily
of third party software development expenses, which were deferred and amortized
over the years ended December 31, 1997 and 1998. From 1997 onwards, these costs
have consisted primarily of salaries and fees paid to employees and consultants
to develop and maintain the software and information contained on Mediconsult's
websites. For the year ended December 31, 1997, these costs were $0.8 million,
for the year ended December 31, 1998, these costs were $1.3 million, an
increase of 63% over the prior year, and for the year ended December 31, 1999
these costs were $7.6 million, an increase of 485% over the prior year. Total
product and content development costs increased from $4.6 million for the nine
months ended September 30, 1999 to $19.8 million for the nine months ended
September 30, 2000. For 1997 and 1998, these costs related primarily to the
development of healthcare content. In 1999 and 2000 these activities were
supplemented by both internal and third party expenses incurred for the
development of new products, such as electronic medical education as well as
costs incurred relating to acquisitions.

     Marketing, Sales And Client Services. Marketing, sales and client services
costs include expenses incurred by Mediconsult to obtain and maintain client
relationships. These costs included salaries and fees paid to employees and
consultants, and programming costs. In 1997, marketing, sales and client
services costs were $1.1 million and for the year ended December 31, 1998,
marketing, sales and client services costs were $1.8 million, an increase of
64% over the prior year. For the year ended December 31, 1999, these costs were
$11.9 million, an increase of 561% over the prior year, consisting primarily of
costs associated with the development and implementation of specific client
marketing programs and of new prototype marketing and advertising programs. A
substantial portion of the increase was attributable to acquisitions and a
marketing agreement entered into with Pharma

Marketing, LLC which resulted in sales and marketing efforts being
significantly increased. Total marketing, sales and client service costs
increased from $7.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 1999 to
$12.1 million for the nine months ended September 30,2000. These costs
increased during this nine month period as Mediconsult's activities in
sponsorships and its medical educational programs increased.

     General And Administrative Expenses. General and administrative expenses
consist primarily of salaries and related costs for general corporate
functions, including finance, accounting and legal expenses, and fees for other
professional services. For the year ended December 31, 1997, general and
administrative expenses were $0.8 million. These expenses were $1.0 million for
the year ended December 31, 1998, an increase of 25% over the prior year, and
$7.1 million for the year ended December 31, 1999, an increase of 610% over the
prior year. Total general and administrative expenses increased from $3.3
million for the nine months ended September 30, 1999 to $5.7 million for the
nine months ended September 30, 2000. The increase in general and
administrative expenses was attributable to increased salaries and related
expenses associated with acquired companies and hiring additional personnel to
support the growth of Mediconsult's operations. In addition, we opened offices
in New York and Toronto in 1999.

     Depreciation And Amortization. Depreciation and amortization expense
includes depreciation of tangible assets and software, using the straight line
method, over the estimated useful lives of the assets. Amortization expense
includes intangible assets such as goodwill. For the year ended December 31,
1997, depreciation and amortization expense was $0.1 million. These expenses
were $0.2 million for the year ended December 31, 1998, an increase of 100%
over the prior year, and $3.8 million for the year ended December 31, 1999, an
increase of 1800% over the prior year. The increases were primarily due to the
growth of Mediconsult, and the acquisitions completed in 1999, principally the
amortization of intangibles arising from the Physicians' Online transaction.
Depreciation and amortization expense increased from $1.4 million for the nine
months ended September 30, 1999 to $32.4 million for the nine months ended
September 30, 2000. These nine month period-to-period increases are primarily
due to the amortization of goodwill from the Physicians' Online acquisition
which was completed in December 1999.

     Restructuring. During the third quarter of 2000, Mediconsult initiated a
restructuring program. The restructuring was intended to reduce its cost
structure for website operations and to focus resources on its core businesses
related to educating and connecting physicians and patients. The restructuring
predominantly affected operations in Mediconsult's Canadian location. During
the third quarter of 2000, a charge of approximately $2.8 million was recorded
with respect to the restructuring of Mediconsult's Canadian location and
website operations. Approximately 100 employees were notified of terminations
as operations were curtailed in line with current demands for Mediconsult's
products. As a result, 96 employees were terminated as of September 30, 2000
and the remaining employees were terminated as of December 31, 2000.

     The restructuring plan was adopted due to several related factors,
including the continued difficulty in successfully executing a consumer
oriented business model and the costs associated with maintaining and enhancing
Mediconsult's consumer web properties, including, mediconsult.com,
heartinfo.org, cyberdiet.com, storknet.com, and pharminfo.com. Furthermore, the
capital market's change in valuation of web-based healthcare companies has made
the raising of additional capital more difficult. As a result of these factors
we adopted the described restructuring during the quarter ended September 30,
2000.

     Mediconsult believes that the actions taken in conjunction with the
restructuring will not adversely affect its ability to increase revenue in any
material fashion. The cost savings associated with the restructuring should
speed Mediconsult's transition to profitability and enhance future cash flows.
It is not anticipated that the cost savings realized as a result of the
restructuring will be offset by future cost increase, unless supported by
additional revenue justifying any such future cost increases.

     Of the total restructuring charge, of $2.8 million, payments of $0.8
million were made in the three months ended September 30, 2000. The balance of
$2.0 million will be paid over time, with the final payments being made upon
the expiration of the lease on the Canadian offices on September 30, 2004.

     Impairment Of Long-Lived Assets. As a further consequence of the factors
described in the foregoing discussion of restructuring charge taken in the
third quarter of 2000, in the same period, Mediconsult realized an impairment
of long-lived assets. A charge of approximately $8.3 million was recorded in
this period related to the write-off of the carrying value of goodwill
originally acquired with the purchase of the operations affected by the
restructuring. Mediconsult has determined that there will be no future cash
flows associated with the goodwill. In addition, certain fixed assets used in
the operations affected by the restructuring will be disposed of during the
fourth quarter of 2000 resulting in a charge of approximately $0.3 million to
reflect a reduction in their carrying value to approximate their fair value,
which is the estimated sales price Mediconsult will receive for the fixed
assets. Mediconsult believes that the actions taken in conjunction with
disposal of these assets will not adversely affect its ability to increase
revenue in any material fashion.

     The charge realized for the impairment of long-lived assets is non-cash
and will have no adverse affect on Mediconsult's future cash flows.

     Fair Value Of Options Granted To Employees. Mediconsult has recorded
compensation expense in connection with the vesting of employee stock options
of $40,235 during the year ended December 31, 1997, $0.3 million during the
year ended December 31, 1998, an increase of 646% over the prior year, and $2.0
million during the year ended December 31, 1999, an increase of 567% over the
prior year. In the nine month period ended September 30, 2000 compensation
expense in connection with the vesting of employee stock options increased to
$1.5 million, an increase of $0.4 million or 36.3% over the expense recognized
in the nine month period ended September 30, 1999 of $1.1 million. The
increases are attributable to an increase in the number of employees and the
number of options being granted to employees and an increase in the value of
each stock option granted.

     Fair Value Of Options Granted To Consultants And Warrants Granted To Third
Parties. The fair value of options and warrants granted to non-employees for
services provided are expensed over the period the services are performed in
accordance with EITF 96-18, "Accounting for Equity Instruments That Are Issued
to Other Than Employees for Acquiring, or in Conjunction with Selling, Goods or
Services." Mediconsult recorded compensation expense in connection with stock
options and warrants granted to consultants and third parties of $0 during the
year ended December 31, 1997, $1.4 million in the year ended December 31, 1998,
and $1.8 million during the year ended December 31, 1999 (an increase of 29%
over the prior year). The related expense increased from $1.7 million for the
nine months ended September 30, 1999 to $1.8 million for the nine months ended
September 30, 2000.

     Compensation expense represents the amortization of deferred compensation
that is measured based on the fair value of the options and warrants granted to
employees, consultants and third parties. These amounts are amortized over the
vesting period of the applicable options. Mediconsult has recorded deferred
compensation for the value of the options granted that have not yet vested of
$0.9 million as of December 31, 1998. $16.1 million as of December 31, 1999 and
$8.3 million as of September 30, 1999.

Quarterly Results of Operations Data

     The following table sets forth certain unaudited quarterly consolidated
statement of operations data for each of the eight quarters ended December 31,
1999. In Mediconsult's opinion, this data has been prepared on substantially
the same basis as the audited financial statements appearing elsewhere in this
report and includes all necessary adjustments, consisting only of normal
recurring adjustments necessary for fair presentation of this data. The
quarterly data should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and
the notes to these statements appearing elsewhere in this report. The results
of operations for any quarter are not necessarily indicative of the results of
operations for any future period.

     Mediconsult has limited operating history upon which to evaluate its
business and predict revenue and planned operating expenses. Mediconsult's
quarterly operating results may vary significantly in the foreseeable future
due to a variety of factors, many of which are outside its control. The timing
of its marketing program and electronic medical education product sales are two
of the most significant factors affecting quarterly results. The time between
the date of initial contact with a potential client and the execution of a
contract with the client typically ranges from six weeks for smaller agreements
nine months for larger agreements. These contracts are also subject to delays
over which Mediconsult has little or no control, including customers budgetary
constraints, their internal acceptance reviews whether or when regulatory
approval of their products is given by the Food and Drug Administration or
other regulatory authority, the possibility of cancellation or delay of
projects by clients and any post-approval actions taken by the FDA or other
regulatory authority, including product recalls. During the selling process,
Mediconsult may expend substantial funds and management resources and yet not
obtain adequate revenue. Once a contract is executed, a significant portion of
Mediconsult's revenue may be derived from custom development efforts and
implementation projects, rather than from recurring fees. As a result,
Mediconsult cannot predict with certainty when it will perform the work
necessary to receive payment for these projects. In addition, traffic levels on
websites have typically fluctuated during the summer, and during year-end and
holiday periods, and Mediconsult could experience a decrease in visitor traffic
to its websites during these periods.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

     Since inception, Mediconsult has financed operations primarily through the
public and private placement of equity securities and advances from its
principal stockholder. Mediconsult's most significant financing transaction was
a public offering completed in April 1999 which raised net proceeds to
Mediconsult of $57 million. As of December 31, 1999, Mediconsult had $22.3
million in cash and cash equivalents compared to $0.1 million at December 31,
1998. In May 2000, Mediconsult received $6.5 million in proceeds from a
placement of equity securities to McKesson HBOC, Inc. As of September 30, 2000,
the cash and cash equivalents balance was $0.9 million.

     Mediconsult has incurred substantial costs to design, develop and
implement Internet-based marketing and advertising programs for clients, to
build brand awareness and to grow its business. As a result, Mediconsult has
incurred operating losses and negative cash flows from operations in each
quarter since commencing operations. As of September 30, 2000, Mediconsult had
an accumulated deficit of $102.0 million. These losses have been primarily
funded through the financing activities described above and by advances
aggregating $5.1 million by a stockholder, an entity controlled by Robert A.
Jennings, Mediconsult's former Chairman and Chief Executive Officer.
Approximately $0.5 million of these advances were repaid and $4.3 million
converted to equity in 1999. The balance was repaid in April 2000.

     To date, Mediconsult has experienced negative cash flows from operating
activities. For the period ended December 31, 1997, net cash used in operating
activities was $2.5 million. For the year ended December 31, 1998, net cash
used in operating activities was $2.7 million. For the year ended December 31,
1999, net cash used in operating activities was $14.4 million. Net cash used in
operating activities for these periods was primarily attributable to net losses
during these periods offset by certain non-cash expenses. For the year ended
December 31, 1999, the increase in net cash used in operating activities was
attributable to a net operating loss of $26.3 million, offset by certain
non-cash items of $11.9 million in the aggregate. This amount was comprised of
deferred compensation expense of $3.9 million related to stock options and
warrants granted to employees and consultants, depreciation of $0.6 million,
amortization of intangibles of $3.1 million, amortization of deferred
compensation related to shares issued for services and membership in Pharma
Marketing LLC of $1.5 million and net changes in operating working capital of
$2.8 million. Net cash used in operating activities during the nine months
ended September 30,1999 was $10.3 million, compared to net cash used in
operating activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2000 of $21.9
million. This increase in cash used was primarily attributable to net losses
during this period, which were partially offset by certain non-cash items of
$49.6 million. This amount was comprised of depreciation and amortization of
$32.4 million, services rendered in exchange for common stock of $2.0 million,
restructuring charges of $2.8 million, impairment of long-lived assets of $8.6
million, and warrants granted to consultants and employees of $6.7 million. Net
cash used reflected several factors, including (1) increased operating expenses
as our business volume increased; (2) an increase in accounts receivable of
$4.7 million; and (3) decreases in accounts payable of $3.3 million.

     For the period ended December 31, 1997, net cash used in investing
activities was $0.1 million. For the year ended December 31, 1998, net cash
used in investing activities was $30,225. For the year ended December 31, 1999,
net cash used in investing activities was $23.7 million. Cash used in investing
activities during 1997 and 1998 related to capital expenditures, primarily the
acquisition of equipment. In 1999, the balance was comprised of $2.4 million of
capital expenditures and $21.3 million on acquisition of subsidiaries, net of
cash acquired of $.2 million. Net cash used in investing activities during the
nine months ended September 30,1999 was $15.7 million, compared to net cash
used in investing activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2000 of
$4.0 million. This decrease in cash used was primarily attributable to the
reduction of acquisition activity and was partially offset by increased fixed
asset purchases.

     For the period ended December 31, 1997, net cash provided by financing
activities was $2.6 million. For the year ended December 31, 1998, net cash
provided by financing activities was $2.4 million. For the year ended December
31, 1999, net cash provided by financing activities was $60.3 million. Net cash
proceeds from financing activities in 1997 and 1998 were primarily attributable
to net proceeds received from unsecured advances from a stockholder in the
aggregate amount of $2.6 million in 1997 and $2.2 million in 1998. By December
31, 1999, $4.3 million of the cash advances from a stockholder made prior to
that date had been converted into junior preferred stock. Net cash provided by
financing activities in 1999 comprised $57 million from the issuance of common
stock and $3.2 million from the issuance of senior preferred stock that was
subsequently converted to common stock. We also had net repayments of $0.2
million to a stockholder in 1999 and realized $0.3 million from the exercise of
stock options. Net cash provided by financing activities during the nine months
ended September 30, 2000 was $4.5 million. The net cash provided by financing
activities in the nine

months ended September 30, 2000 was the result of a $6.5 million private
placement of Mediconsult common stock to McKesson HBOC, Inc. in May 2000.

     As of December 31, 1999, Mediconsult had no principal capital commitments
outstanding. During 2000, Mediconsult expects to repay $5.0 million of notes
payable. In addition, at December 31, 1999 Mediconsult had lease obligations
totaling $1,266,000, as more specifically set forth below:

                Year                    Lease Obligations
- ------------------------------------   ------------------

  2000 .............................       $  434,000
  2001 .............................          227,000

  2004 .............................          160,000
                                           ----------
  Total lease obligations ..........       $1,266,000

     Subsequent to December 31, 1999, Mediconsult has entered into additional
lease agreements which will increase its lease obligations in 2000, 2001, 2002,
2003, and 2004, by $801,567, $915,156, $915,156, $228,789, and $0,
respectively.

     In connection with its sponsorship and management of INCIID.ORG,
Mediconsult has committed to pay INCIID $0.5 million per year beginning in 1999
for three years in equal quarterly installments, in cash or common stock as
Mediconsult determines with respect to each quarter.

     Mediconsult's ability to generate significant revenue is uncertain.
Mediconsult incurred net losses of approximately $2.6 million for the year
ended December 31, 1997, $4.9 million for the year ended December 31, 1998 and
$26.3 million for the year ended December 31, 1999. Mediconsult incurred net
losses attributable to common stockholders of approximately $67.4 million and
$15.9 million for the nine month periods ended September 30, 2000 and September
30, 1999, respectively. Mediconsult expects losses from operations and negative
cash flow to continue for the foreseeable future and at least through the year
2000 as a result of its expansion plans and expectations that operating
expenses will increase in the next several years. The rate at which these
losses will be incurred may increase from current levels. Although Mediconsult
has experienced revenue growth in recent periods, its revenue may not remain at
current levels or increase in the future. If its revenue does not increase and
if spending levels are not adjusted accordingly, Mediconsult may not generate
sufficient revenue to achieve profitability, which would have a material
adverse effect on its business, financial condition and results of operations.
Even if Mediconsult achieves profitability, it may not sustain or increase
profitability on a quarterly or annual basis in the future.

     Mediconsult's working capital requirements depend on numerous factors.
Mediconsult has experienced a substantial increase in expenditures since
inception consistent with growth in its operations and staffing, and
anticipates that this will continue for the foreseeable future. Mediconsult
anticipates incurring additional expenses to increase its marketing and sales
efforts, for new product and content development and for technology and
infrastructure development. Additionally, Mediconsult will continue to evaluate
possible investments in businesses, products and technologies, the expansion of
our marketing and sales programs and more aggressive brand promotions. If
Mediconsult experiences a shortfall in revenue in relation to expenses, or if
its expenses precede increased revenue, its business, financial condition and
results of operation and could be materially and adversely affected.

     Mediconsult has incurred significant losses and negative cash flow from
operations during the nine-months ended September 30, 2000 and expects these
conditions to continue for the foreseeable future. In addition, Mediconsult is
in default on notes payable which were due on October 31, 2000. Mediconsult has
negative working capital and needs additional capital to fund operations and
liquidate liabilities in the ordinary course of business during the year ending
December 31, 2001. Management's current plan, which is discussed in greater
detail below, includes merging with Andrx

Corporation. In the event Mediconsult's planned merger with Andrx is not
completed or if it is otherwise unable to obtain needed capital on appropriate
terms, operations would need to be significantly scaled back or discontinued.

     In January 2001, the Mediconsult board of directors approved a merger
agreement with Andrx Corporation, under which Mediconsult will become a
wholly-owned subsidiary of Andrx Corporation.

     Under the merger agreement, each share of Mediconsult common stock, issued
and outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the merger will
automatically convert into 0.1430 shares of Cybear tracking stock, subject to
adjustment. In addition, options and warrants to acquire Mediconsult common
stock outstanding immediately before the effective time of the merger will be
assumed by Andrx Corporation and converted into options and warrants to acquire
Cybear tracking stock at the rate of 0.1430 shares of Cybear tracking stock,
subject to adjustment. The Cybear tracking stock is a class of Andrx common
stock designed to track the financial performance of Andrx Corporation's
Internet assets, which are referred to as Cybear.

     In connection with the merger, Mediconsult entered into a credit agreement
with Cybear Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of Andrx Corporation, whereby,
Cybear Inc. agreed to provide Mediconsult with up to $2.0 million in interim
financing to fund its operating activities until the effective time of the
merger. Amounts borrowed under such credit agreement are due on July 15, 2001,
and collateralized by all of the outstanding common stock of Physicians Online.
In the event that the merger agreement is terminated, the amount due is
convertible into shares of Mediconsult common stock at a conversion price of
$0.125 per share. In addition, Mediconsult issued Cybear Inc. a warrant to
purchase 8,926,502 shares of Mediconsult common stock at an exercise price of
$0.125 per share, exercisable up to January 9, 2006 but only in the event that
the merger agreement is terminated and Mediconsult is obligated to pay the $1.0
million termination fee.

     In the event that the merger is terminated under certain conditions
defined in the agreement, the breaching party will pay the other party a
termination fee of $750,000. In the event that the merger agreement is
terminated certain conditions defined in the merger agreement, Andrx will
receive a termination fee of $1.0 million, in addition to the issuance of a
warrant to purchase up to 19.9% of the then outstanding capital stock of
Mediconsult.

     Although a significant portion of Mediconsult's revenue is derived from
activities conducted outside the United States, fees paid to Mediconsult have
been and are expected to continue to be paid in U.S. dollars. However, a
substantial portion of Mediconsult's payroll is paid, and it is expected that
rent under leases of office facilities outside the United States will be paid,
in currencies other than U.S. dollars. Because its financial results are
reported in U.S. dollars, they are affected by changes in the value of the
various foreign currencies in which Mediconsult makes payments in relation to
the U.S. dollar. Mediconsult does not cover known or anticipated operating
exposures through foreign currency exchange option or forward contracts. The
primary currency for which Mediconsult has foreign currency exchange rate
exposure is the Canadian dollar. Mediconsult's financial instruments, including
cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued
liabilities and advances from shareholder are carried at cost, which
approximates their fair value because of the short-term maturity of these
instruments.

Impact of Recent Accounting Pronouncements

     Mediconsult's management believes that the future adoption of recently
issued accounting standards will not have a material impact on Mediconsult's
financial statements, except that Mediconsult is currently evaluating the
future impact that Staff Accounting Bulletin 101, "Revenue Recognition," issued
in December 1999 by the Securities and Exchange Commission, will have on its
financial statements.

                            BUSINESS OF MEDICONSULT

Overview

     Mediconsult was founded as a Delaware corporation in 1996. It uses the
Internet to educate and connect doctors and patients. Mediconsult's web
communities and interactive solutions educate physicians, empower patients and
enable more effective doctor-patient relationships. Mediconsult provides
relevant tools, reliable services and quality medical information, that save
doctors time and improve health outcomes for their patients.

     Mediconsult's focus is on the chronic medical conditions that are
responsible for the majority of healthcare spending. By fostering communities
centered on prevalent medical conditions and health issues, Mediconsult
believes it creates significant opportunities for pharmaceutical and other
healthcare companies to effectively reach physician and patient audiences using
Internet-based educational, marketing and sponsorship programs.

     On December 16, 1999, Mediconsult completed the acquisition of Physicians'
Online, Inc., a physicians-only Internet service that provides doctors with
clinically oriented services, tools, and information. It is a secure,
physicians-only environment featuring access to clinical discussion groups,
medical databases, daily medical news, continuing medical education credits,
clinical symposia, e-mail accounts, Internet access, secure prescription
transactions, market research and recruiting services, among other services.
Membership is free so long as the member does not use Physicians' Online as its
Internet Service Provider. Physicians' Online's services are principally
supported by pharmaceutical and direct-to-physician advertising sponsors as
well as subscription fees from its members using it as an Internet Service
Provider and MDDirect, a physician recruitment business.

     Mediconsult address is 560 White Plains Road, 4th Floor, Tarrytown, NY
10591. Its telephone number is (914) 332-6100 and its principal websites are
www.mediconsultinc.com and www.pol.net. Information contained on its websites
is not, and should not be deemed to be, a part of this proxy
statement/prospectus.

Industry Background

     As consumers have become more proactive in their personal healthcare
decisions, they have increasingly searched for information about medical
conditions, treatment alternatives and medical outcomes. This trend has also
accelerated the use and acceptance of the Internet by healthcare providers. The
Internet enables individuals, whether patients or healthcare professionals, to
access large quantities of this information quickly and easily. With this
growth in healthcare information available online, and the ubiquity of the
Internet, physicians and other healthcare professionals have begun to accept
the Internet as a tool enabling them to more effectively and efficiently
provide healthcare to their patients.

     The Rapid Growth Of The Internet. The growth of the Internet as a new
means of communicating, accessing information and engaging in commerce has been
rapid and is expected to accelerate. Jupiter Communications estimates that the
number of Internet users worldwide will grow to approximately 250 million by
the end of 2002. This growth is being driven by a number of factors, including
a growing base of personal computers in the home and workplace, improvements in
network infrastructure, more convenient, faster and inexpensive Internet
access, technological advances in PCs and modems, increased quantity and
quality of content available on the Internet and the overall increased public
awareness of the Internet. Due to its large audience, the Internet represents a
significant channel for advertisers.

     The Interactive Nature Of The Internet. The Internet provides an effective
method for individuals to access large quantities of reliable and independent
information on medical conditions, treatment alternatives and medical outcomes.
Mediconsult believes that access to this information,

together with support groups and interaction with medical experts on-line,
leads to a greater understanding of health issues and improved patient
compliance with pharmaceutical protocols. The Internet also provides an
attractive vehicle for pharmaceutical and other healthcare companies to
increase consumers' awareness of diagnosed and undiagnosed medical conditions
and treatment options. The Internet allows pharmaceutical companies to easily
provide information targeted to visitors' needs, which may lead to improved
patient compliance with prescribed drug therapies. It has been estimated that
10% of prescriptions are never filled, 33% are not properly refilled and 50%
are not taken as prescribed, resulting in poorer health outcomes for patients
and increased expenditures to the overall healthcare system.

     Advertising On The Internet. The Internet's interactive nature, coupled
with the demographics of the Internet healthcare user, makes the Internet an
attractive vehicle for both direct-to-consumer and direct-to-healthcare
professional advertising of prescription pharmaceuticals. Mediconsult believes
that the Internet will capture an increasing portion of this market as
pharmaceutical companies recognize the value of this medium for their products.

     Delivery Of Medical Education Over The Internet. The Internet's
interactive nature and the ability to access the medium from home, office and
many other locations makes the Internet a viable alternative to existing
methods of delivering medical education to healthcare professionals.
Mediconsult believes that the Internet will capture an increasing portion of
spending for medical education as pharmaceutical companies recognize the
Internet as a reliable, cost-effective alternative to traditional methods of
delivering medical education to healthcare professionals.

The Solution

     Through its websites, Mediconsult addresses physicians and consumers'
needs for healthcare information and provides a targeted marketing and
advertising platform for pharmaceutical and other healthcare companies. Key
elements of this solution include:

     High Quality Trusted Content; User-Friendly Environment. Mediconsult
provides its visitors with high quality content on specific medical conditions
and health issues and an easy-to-navigate environment. Its staff searches for
and reviews extensive amounts of health information and selects relevant
material from a wide variety of sources, including medical journals, healthcare
association literature and general periodicals.

     Large, Highly Targeted Audience. Mediconsult's websites are designed to
attract a highly desirable target audience of healthcare professionals and
patients for pharmaceutical manufacturers and other healthcare companies.
Mediconsult has developed a sophisticated, integrated database of demographic
information about healthcare professionals' and patients' needs, habits,
preferences and intentions. Mediconsult is able to identify its visitor traffic
patterns by condition or health issue, which provides relevant information for
clients seeking to target an audience for a particular pharmaceutical product
or condition.

     Broad, Sophisticated Internet Healthcare Marketing And Advertising
Programs. Mediconsult designs, develops, and implements broad, sophisticated
Internet compliance, launch, marketing and direct-to-consumer advertising
programs for pharmaceutical and other healthcare companies and provides ongoing
support services as part of these programs. Mediconsult utilizes its extensive
knowledge of the Internet healthcare user and its high quality, focused content
to effectively design and develop programs focused on a particular product or
health issue. These programs incorporate one or more of a broad spectrum of
Internet-based tools and products ranging from condition diagnosis tools, to
targeted site sponsorships, to customized websites containing relevant content
from its websites. In addition, Mediconsult delivers high quality, real-time
interactive medical education programs via the Internet.

Mediconsult Strategy

     Effective upon its acquisition of Physicians' Online, Mediconsult changed
its business strategy and announced that it would no longer be selling banner
advertisements on its patient-focused websites. Mediconsult is now primarily
focused on physicians as the driving force of most healthcare spending.
Mediconsult operates the first and one of the most active online network of
physicians -- Physicians' Online. Physicians' Online has been operating since
1992. The Physicians' Online network offers a number of services and tools for
physicians that focus on the physician's on-line clinical needs, including:

     o journal articles;
     o medical associations;
     o medical news;
     o practice management tools;
     o continuing medical education;
     o discussion forums;
     o e-mail;
     o Internet access;
     o recruitment services;
     o build-a-website;
     o Rx sample ordering; and
     o e-commerce.

     The Physicians' Online network is accessible only by members that have
been authenticated as practicing U.S.-based physicians prior to their entering
the site. The authentication process requires the physician to provide personal
information that is then matched to the American Medical Association database,
or to provide other appropriate documentation like a medical license, for
example, via fax. Once the physician has been authenticated, Mediconsult
provides him or her with a username and password to use each time they visit
the network.

     Physicians' Online operated an ISP as an additional service to its
members. Historically, approximately half of Physicians' Online's active
members accessed the service through the Physicians' Online ISP. However, in
the Fall of 2000, Mediconsult announced a strategic alliance with AT&T Internet
Services to provide Internet access to the Physicians' Online membership. Since
this announcement, the number of Physicians' Online members accessing the
Physicians' Online Website has declined rapidly as they migrated to other
methods of accessing the Internet. Effective January 31, 2001, the Physicians'
Online ISP will be terminated and all members will be required to access the
site via other ISPs.

     The most popular features of the Physicians' Online site are the clinical
discussion forums, medical literature searches and e-mail. There are more than
35,000 active discussion `threads' on Physicians' Online. Members can post
clinical information about a difficult case and receive advice from their
colleagues.

     As a result of the Physicians' Online merger, Mediconsult has one of the
largest authenticated, physicians-only audiences, combined with one of the
largest patient audiences. This asset allows Mediconsult to focus more intently
on the opportunities in areas such as electronic medical education, as
evidenced by its September 1999 agreement with Bristol-Myers Squibb, and
physician programs such as the Mydoctor.com initiative which allows a
Physicians' Online-member physician to create his or her own custom website in
only minutes.

     In the patient healthcare arena, Mediconsult's primary focus historically
was the design, development and implementation of interactive solutions that
educated physicians, empowered patients and enabled a more effective
physician/patient relationship. Mediconsult continues to create and maintain
communities of doctors and patients and specialize in enabling communication
between

members of these two distinct communities. However, since July 2000, when
Mediconsult announced the discontinuance of its patient-oriented websites, the
importance of direct-to-consumer advertising programs has diminished
substantially. Mediconsult has announced its intent to sell these consumer
sites and has completed the sale of heartinfo.org, cyberdiet.com and
storknet.com. The sale of the Mood Sciences website and assets is pending.

     Broaden Relationships With Pharmaceutical Companies. Mediconsult seeks to
broaden relationships with pharmaceutical companies in several ways. It
attempts to expand relationships with existing clients to broaden the number of
programs, both in terms of number of products and types of client services,
provided to them. For example, Mediconsult's work with the Ethicon Endo-Surgery
unit of Johnson & Johnson as a discussion group sponsor has led to other
opportunities to expand its services within Johnson & Johnson. Mediconsult also
continues to actively pursue a number of additional major pharmaceutical
companies and other healthcare clients with proposals tailored to their
specific products and marketing strategies.

     Build Strong Brand Awareness. Mediconsult believes that establishing brand
awareness is critical to attracting and retaining visitors and advertisers.
Mediconsult seeks to build its brand by creating a superior visitor experience
and creating broad awareness of its name as the trusted, secure, on-line source
for healthcare information for healthcare professionals and their patients.

Products and Services

  Physician-Oriented Products and Services

     Mediconsult primarily designs and develops physician-oriented programs.
These include programs such as electronic medical education, and the
Mydoctor.com suite of products to physicians and patients. Through Physicians'
Online, Mediconsult also offers secure physician-only communities that allow
medical professionals to openly discuss clinical issues and outcomes, and other
services designed to facilitate the physician/patient relationship.

  Marketing and Advertising Programs

     Mediconsult designs, develops and implements sophisticated on-line
marketing and advertising programs for pharmaceutical and other healthcare
companies. These programs are intended to educate physicians and patients on
particular medical conditions, increase their awareness of treatment options,
describe the benefits of various treatments and generally increase compliance
with treatment protocols. Mediconsult's programs include:

     o condition-specific site sponsorships, visitor polls and surveys, to
build brand awareness;

     o condition-specific content, to educate the targeted visitor group;

     o calls to action and other visitor interactions, such as requests for
     product samples;

   o design and development of customized websites focused on a particular
     product, treatment or medical condition; and

     o development of product positioning strategies and initiation of on-line
program launches.

Joint Ventures, Strategic Acquisitions and Relationships

  Joint Ventures

     In February 1999, Mediconsult entered into a memorandum of agreement to
form a 50/50 joint venture with CommonHealth LLP. The venture was intended to
focus on providing pharmaceutical

and other healthcare companies with innovative approaches to marketing their
products in comprehensive marketing and advertising campaigns containing both
significant Internet components and traditional media such as, print,
television and direct marketing. Based upon changed strategic focus, the
documentation to finalize the venture was not completed, and during 1999,
CommonHealth and Mediconsult agreed to terminate the relationship.

  Strategic Acquisitions and Sponsorship Programs

     In the past Mediconsult grew its consumer oriented businesses through
strategic acquisitions and agreements. In July 2000, Mediconsult announced the
discontinuation of its consumer oriented businesses. This announcement led to
the sale of several websites and their associated assets and the termination of
active updating and marketing of the other consumer websites. These
transactions and their current status is as follows:

     Inciid.org. Inciid.org is a website providing information on infertility.
In February 1999, Mediconsult entered into an exclusive sponsorship agreement
with the InterNational Counsel on Infertility Information Dissemination, a
not-for-profit organization granting Mediconsult, among other things, the sole
right to place advertisements on the inciid.org website and to link traffic.
This relationship has been terminated by Mediconsult and is the subject of a
pending arbitration proceeding. The parties have just recently executed a
settlement agreement.

     Cyberdiet.com. Cyberdiet.com is a website providing tailored nutritional
information and programs. On May 11, 1999, Mediconsult completed the
acquisition of CyberDiet, Inc., the owner of cyberdiet.com which provides
tailored nutritional information and programs, in exchange for 400,000 shares
of its common stock issued to the former shareholders of CyberDiet. The total
purchase price, including acquisition costs and assumption of net liabilities,
was $2.8 million. The fair value of shares provided as consideration was
determined by the market price of the shares at the announcement date, February
25, 1999. The excess of the purchase price over net assets acquired was
recorded as goodwill and is being amortized on a straight-line basis over five
years. The cyberdiet.com website and certain related assets were sold to
Dietwatch.com, Inc. in December 2000 in exchange for $250,000 and DietWatch.com
stock valued at $1.0 million.

     Cyber-tech, Inc. Cyber-tech is a company that has developed and provides
high quality content and tools focused on heart disease and related areas that
have attracted a large and growing number of visitors to the www.heartinfo.org
website. On June 14, 1999, Mediconsult acquired all of the capital stock of
Cyber-Tech. The consideration paid to Cyber-Tech shareholders consisted of
$3,765,000 in cash and 267,732 shares of Mediconsult common stock. Mediconsult
and the shareholders of Cyber-Tech also entered into an escrow agreement with
respect to certain of the shares of Mediconsult common stock issued to the
former Cyber-Tech shareholders. The total transaction value, including
acquisition costs, was $7.6 million. The fair value of shares provided as
consideration was determined by the market price of the shares at the
transaction date. The excess of the purchase price over net assets acquired was
allocated to goodwill and other intangible assets. Goodwill and other
intangible assets are being amortized on a straight-line basis over an
estimated useful life of three to five years. Certain assets of Cyber-Tech,
including the heartinfo.org website were sold to Quadrant Healthcom in November
2000.

     Mood Sciences, Inc. Mood Sciences is a company that specializes in mental
health disease management innovations. Mood Sciences was acquired on October
27, 1999, in exchange for 215,000 shares of Mediconsult common stock. The total
purchase price, including acquisition costs of $0.2 million and assumption of
net liabilities of $0.2 million, was $1.9 million. The fair value of shares
provided as consideration was determined by the market price of the shares at
the transaction date. The excess of the purchase price over net assets acquired
was recorded as goodwill and is being amortized on a straight-line basis over
five years. Mediconsult is currently completing negotiations to sell
substantially all of the assets of Mood Sciences to the founder of Mood
Sciences. Mediconsult expects to complete this transaction in the first quarter
of 2001.

     Physicians' Online, Inc. Physicians' Online is a company with more
authenticated doctor-users than most other medical website. On December 16,
1999, Mediconsult acquired the shares of Physicians' Online, a provider of an
exclusive network for physicians in addition to on-line medical information and
communications. Physicians' Online operates a secure, physicians-only
environment featuring access to medical databases, daily medical news,
continuing medical education credits, clinical symposia, e-mail accounts,
Internet access, and other services. As consideration for the acquisition,
Mediconsult issued approximately 18.5 million shares of Mediconsult common
stock. The total value of consideration was $183.1 million, including the
assumption of debt and acquisition costs. Identifiable intangible assets
resulting from the transaction are amortized over periods ranging from three to
five years.

Sales and Marketing

     Until September 1999, Mediconsult's sales and marketing was managed
entirely by Mediconsult employees. In September 1999, Mediconsult entered into
a relationship with Pharma Marketing, LLC under which responsibility for sales
and marketing of certain aspects of its business to pharmaceutical companies is
managed by this newly formed company. Marketing and program design continue to
be managed by its own employees.

     Pharma Marketing is a marketing company formed in September 1999 which, as
its only business, conducts sales and marketing activities on behalf of
Mediconsult. On September 7, 1999, Mediconsult entered into a membership
investment agreement for the purchase of 35% of the aggregate membership
interests of Pharma Marketing for $1,250,000 and 200,000 shares of Mediconsult
common stock. The remaining 65% of Pharma Marketing is owned by a certain
individual. Under the terms of an operating agreement with and among
Mediconsult, Pharma Marketing and the individual, the $1,250,000 contributed by
Mediconsult and 100,000 of the 200,000 shares that Mediconsult issued to Pharma
Marketing, were distributed to this individual in September 1999. In September
2000, the remaining 100,000 shares of Mediconsult common stock were distributed
to this individual.

     Mediconsult generally seeks to hire individuals with significant
experience in program design, marketing and from the Internet and healthcare
industries.

Infrastructure, Operations and Technology

     Mediconsult's operating infrastructure has been designed and implemented
to support the reliable and swift delivery of hundreds of thousands of page
views a day. The design of its websites allows for growth into millions of page
views per day. Web pages are generated and delivered, in response to visitors'
requests by any one of multiple web servers. Key attributes of this
infrastructure include scalability, performance and service availability.

     Mediconsult has deployed a standard production and development server
environment utilizing standard software solutions running on generally
available server hardware platforms. Mediconsult is currently transitioning its
systems hosted at various offsite facilities to an in-house software
environment to be located in the United States in its Tarrytown, NY facilities.
Its web-based software systems use standard, off-the-shelf software components.
Mediconsult's strategy is to license and integrate "best-of-breed" commercially
available technology from industry leaders such as IBM, Sun Microsystems and
Microsoft whenever possible. Mediconsult believes this architecture will allow
it to increase rapidly the scale of its systems in a cost-effective manner.

     Mediconsult's production data is copied to backup tapes each night and
stored at a third party, off-site storage facility. Mediconsult does not have a
comprehensive disaster recovery plan but is in the process of developing such a
plan to respond to system failures. Mediconsult has engaged International
Computer Security Associates to conduct a security audit of its systems. Strict
password management and physical security measures are followed.

Competition

     There are many companies that provide Internet and non-Internet based
education, content, marketing and advertising services to the healthcare
industry. All of these companies compete with Mediconsult for clients, and
Internet healthcare companies also compete with it for visitor traffic.
Mediconsult expects competition to continue to increase as there are no
substantial barriers to entry in its markets. Increased competition could
result in reductions in the fees Mediconsult receives for its services, lower
margins, loss of clients, reduced visitor traffic to its websites, or loss of
market share. Any of these occurrences could materially and adversely affect
its business, financial condition and results of operations. Competition is
also likely to increase significantly, not only as new entities enter the
market, but also as current competitors expand their services. Mediconsult's
principal competitors include:

   o advertising agencies and consulting firms, such as Young & Rubicam and
     Agency.com, that develop marketing and advertising programs for
     pharmaceutical and other healthcare companies;

   o websites that deliver consumer and professional healthcare information,
     either as their sole focus or as part of a more broadly-based site, such
     as iVillage, OnHealth, WebMD, and Medscape;

   o Other, larger companies that either have entered the Internet healthcare
     markets or have announced an intention to do so, such as IMS Health,
     McKesson HBOC, Quintiles Transnational, and National Data Corporation;

   o general purpose consumer online service providers, such as America Online
     and the Microsoft Network;

     o website development firms, such as USWeb/CKS; and

   o publishers and distributors of television, radio and print, such as FOX,
     CBS, Disney, NBC and Time Warner.

     Mediconsult's ability to compete depends on a number of factors, many of
which are outside of its control. These factors include quality of content,
ease of use, timing and market acceptance of new and enhanced services, and
level of sales and marketing efforts.

     Many of its existing competitors, as well as a number of potential new
competitors, have longer operating histories, greater name recognition,
existing relationships with pharmaceutical and other healthcare companies and
significantly greater financial, technical and marketing resources than
Mediconsult does. This may allow them to devote greater resources than
Mediconsult to the development and promotion of their services. These
competitors may also engage in more extensive development efforts, undertake
more far-reaching marketing campaigns, adopt more aggressive pricing policies
and make more attractive offers to existing and potential employees,
advertisers and alliance partners. Mediconsult's competitors may develop
services that are equal or superior to those provided by Mediconsult or that
achieve greater market acceptance and brand recognition than Mediconsult
achieves. In addition, current and potential competitors have established or
may establish cooperative relationships among themselves or with third parties
to increase their ability to address the needs of advertisers. It is possible
that new competitors may emerge and rapidly acquire significant market share.
Mediconsult may not be able to compete successfully or competitive pressures
may have a material adverse effect on its business, results of operations and
financial condition. If clients perceive the Internet generally or its websites
in particular to be a relatively limited or ineffective medium, clients may be
reluctant to devote a significant portion of their budgets to Internet
advertising or to advertise on its websites.

Intellectual Property, Proprietary Rights and Domain Names

     Mediconsult protects its intellectual property through a combination of
trademark and copyright law, trade secret protection and confidentiality with
employees, customers, independent contractors

and strategic partners. Mediconsult pursues the registration of its domain
names, trademarks and service marks in the United States, and has obtained
trademark registration in the United States of the "MEDICONSULT.COM" and
"PHYSICIANS' ONLINE" marks and assert various other trademarks and
servicemarks. Effective trademark, service mark, copyright and trade secret
protection may not be available in every country in which its services and
products are made available on-line. Mediconsult obtains a majority of its
content from the public domain. In addition, Mediconsult creates some of its
own content and obtains rights to use the balance of its content from third
parties. It is possible that Mediconsult could become subject to infringement
actions based upon the content obtained from these third parties. In addition,
others may use this content and Mediconsult may be subject to claims from
licensors. Mediconsult currently has no patents; however, it has one patent
pending which was acquired in the Mood Sciences transaction. This pending
patent will be transferred to the purchaser of the Mood Sciences assets at the
time the transaction closes. Mediconsult does not anticipate that patents will
become significant part of its intellectual property in the future. Mediconsult
seeks to enter into confidentiality agreements with its employees and
independent consultants and has instituted procedures to control access to and
distribution of its technology, documentation and other proprietary information
and the proprietary information of others. The steps Mediconsult takes to
protect its proprietary rights may not be adequate and third parties may
infringe or misappropriate its copyrights, trademarks, service marks and
similar proprietary rights. In addition, other parties may assert claims of
infringement of intellectual property or other proprietary rights against
Mediconsult. The legal status of intellectual property on the Internet is
currently subject to various uncertainties.

Human Resources

     As of September 2000, Mediconsult employed 166 full-time employees, of
whom 19 were in marketing, sales and program design, 68 were in product and
content development, 20 were in administration and corporate services, and 59
were in operations and support. Competition for personnel is intense and
Mediconsult may not be able to retain its senior management or other key
personnel in the future. None of its current employees is represented by a
labor union or is the subject of a collective bargaining agreement. Mediconsult
believes that its relations with employees are good. Since September 30, 2000,
Mediconsult has reduced its workforce substantially. As of January 26, 2001,
Mediconsult employs approximately 85 individuals.

Government Regulation and Legal Uncertainties

     General. There is an increasing number of laws and regulations pertaining
to the Internet. In addition, a number of legislative and regulatory proposals
are under consideration by federal, state, local and foreign governments and
agencies. Laws or regulations may be adopted with respect to the Internet
relating to liability for information retrieved from or transmitted over the
Internet, online content regulation, visitor privacy, taxation and quality of
products and services. Moreover, the applicability to the Internet of existing
laws governing issues such as intellectual property ownership and infringement,
copyright, trademark, trade secret, obscenity, libel, employment and personal
privacy is uncertain and developing. Any new legislation or regulation, or the
application or interpretation of existing laws may have an adverse effect on
Mediconsult's business. In addition to Internet regulation, Mediconsult's
websites may be subject to numerous state and federal laws that govern the
delivery of healthcare services and goods in the United States. These laws
range from laws prohibiting the offer, payment or receipt of remuneration to
induce referrals to entities providing healthcare services and goods to
licensure requirements as well as special protection for healthcare data. These
laws are complicated and are under constant revision and interpretation. These
laws and their active enforcement, particularly in the area of healthcare
fraud, affects the way all healthcare providers structure their business
relationships and deliver healthcare services and goods. New developments in
this area could affect the structure and operation of Mediconsult's business.
In the event some state or federal regulatory agency determined that
Mediconsult's relationship with one or

more of its clients that deliver healthcare services or goods violate any such
laws, then Mediconsult could be subjected to fines and other costs and could be
required to revise or terminate that portion of its business.

     Liability for Information Retrieved From the Company's Websites and From
the Internet.  Content may be accessed on Mediconsult's websites and this
content may be downloaded by visitors and subsequently transmitted to others
over the Internet. This could result in claims against Mediconsult based on a
variety of theories, including defamation, practicing medicine without a
license, malpractice, obscenity, negligence, copyright or trademark
infringement or other theories based on the nature, publication and
distribution of this content. Some of these types of claims have been brought,
sometimes successfully, against providers of Internet services in the past.
Mediconsult could also be exposed to liability with respect to third-party
content that may be posted by visitors in chat rooms or bulletin boards offered
on its websites. It is also possible that if any information contains errors or
false or misleading information, third parties could make claims against
Mediconsult for losses incurred in reliance on such information. In addition,
Mediconsult may be subject to claims alleging that, by directly or indirectly
providing links to other websites, it is liable for copyright or trademark
infringement or the wrongful actions of third parties through their respective
websites. The Communications Decency Act of 1996 provides that, under certain
circumstances, a provider of Internet services shall not be treated as a
publisher or speaker of any information provided by a third-party content
provider. This safe harbor has been interpreted to exempt certain activities of
providers of Internet services. Mediconsult's activities may prevent it from
being able to take advantage of this safe harbor provision. While Mediconsult
attempts to reduce its exposure to such potential liability through, among
other things, visitor policies and disclaimers, the enforceability and
effectiveness of such measures are uncertain. Any claims brought against
Mediconsult in this respect may have a material and adverse effect on its
business.

     On-Line Content Regulations. While Mediconsult does not believe the
content on its websites is obscene or indecent, its websites contain healthcare
content which is explicit in nature and is intended for a mature audience.
Several federal and state statutes prohibit the transmission of certain types
of indecent, obscene or offensive content over the Internet to certain persons.
The enforcement of these statutes and initiatives, and any future enforcement
activities, statutes and initiatives, may result in limitations on the type of
content and advertisements available on Mediconsult's websites. Legislation
regulating online content could dampen the growth in use of the Internet
generally and decrease the acceptance of the Internet as an advertising and
e-commerce medium, which could have a material adverse effect on its business,
results of operations and financial condition. Mediconsult adheres to the
Health on the Network code of conduct which establishes guidelines for health
information on the Internet.

     Privacy Concerns. The Federal Trade Commission, commonly referred to as
the FTC, is considering adopting regulations regarding the collection and use
of personal identifying information obtained from individuals when accessing
websites, with particular emphasis on access by minors. Such regulations may
include requirements that companies establish certain procedures to, among
other things: (1) give adequate notice to consumers regarding information
collection and disclosure practices, (2) provide consumers with the ability to
have personal identifiable information deleted from a company's database, (3)
provide consumers with access to their personal information and with the
ability to rectify inaccurate information, (4) clearly identify affiliations or
a lack thereof with third parties that may collect information or sponsor
activities on a company's website and (5) obtain express parental consent prior
to collecting and using personal identifying information obtained from children
under 13 years of age. Such regulation may also include enforcement and redress
provisions. While Mediconsult has implemented or intends to implement programs
designed to enhance the protection of the privacy of its visitors, including
children, there can be no assurance that such programs will conform with any
regulations adopted by the FTC. The FTC's regulatory and enforcement efforts
may adversely affect the ability to collect demographic and personal
information from visitors, which could have an adverse effect on Mediconsult's
ability to provide highly targeted opportunities for clients, advertisers and
e-commerce marketers.

     It is also possible that "cookies", information keyed to a specific
server, file pathway or directory location that is stored on a visitor's hard
drive, possibly without the visitor's knowledge, used to track demographic
information and to target advertising may become subject to laws limiting or
prohibiting their use. A number of Internet commentators, advocates and
governmental bodies in the United States and other countries have urged the
passage of laws limiting or abolishing the use of cookies. Limitations on or
elimination of Mediconsult's use of cookies could limit the effectiveness of
its targeting of advertisements, which could have a material adverse effect on
its business, results of operations and financial condition.

     The European Union, or EU, has adopted a directive that imposes
restrictions on the collection and use of personal data. Under the Directive,
EU citizens are guaranteed certain rights, including the right of access to
their data, the right to know where the data originated, the right to have
inaccurate data rectified, the right to recourse in the event of unlawful
processing and the right to withhold permission to use their data for direct
marketing. The directive could, among other things, affect U.S. companies that
collect information over the Internet from individuals in EU member countries,
and may impose restrictions that are more stringent than current Internet
privacy standard in the United States. In particular, companies with offices
located in EU countries will not be allowed to send personal information to
countries that do not maintain adequate standards of privacy. The directive
does not, however, define what standards of privacy are adequate. As a result,
there can be no assurance that the directive will not adversely affect the
activities of entities, such as Mediconsult, which engage in data collection
from visitors in EU member countries.

     Domain Names. Domain names are Internet "addresses." The current system
for registering, allocating and managing domain names has been the subject of
litigation, including trademark litigation, and of proposed regulatory reform.
Mediconsult has registered as URLs, the domain names "mediconsult.com,"
"mediconsultinc.com" and "pol.net" among other URLs. Although we have
registered "MEDICONSULT.COM" and "PHYSICIANS' ONLINE" as trademarks, third
parties may bring claims for infringement against Mediconsult for the use of
these trademarks. There can be no assurance that Mediconsult's domain names
will not lose their value, or that Mediconsult will not have to obtain entirely
new domain names in addition to or in lieu of its current domain names if
reform efforts result in a restructuring of the current system.

     Jurisdictions. Due to the global nature of the Internet, it is possible
that, although transmissions by Mediconsult over the Internet originate
primarily in the United States, the governments of other states and foreign
countries might attempt to regulate such transmissions or prosecute Mediconsult
for violations of their laws. These laws may be modified, or new laws enacted,
in the future. Any of the foregoing developments could have a material adverse
effect on Mediconsult's business, results of operations and financial
condition. In addition, as Mediconsult service is available over the Internet
in multiple states and foreign countries, these jurisdictions may claim that we
are required to qualify to do business as a foreign corporation in each state
or foreign country. Mediconsult has not qualified to do business as a foreign
corporation in any jurisdiction. This failure to qualify as a foreign
corporation in a jurisdiction where it is required to do so could subject
Mediconsult to taxes and penalties and could result in its inability to enforce
contracts in such jurisdictions. Any new legislation or regulation, the
application of laws and regulations from jurisdictions whose laws do not
currently apply to our business, or the application of existing laws and
regulations to the Internet and other online services could have a material
adverse effect on Mediconsult business, financial condition and results of
operations.

Description of Property

     Mediconsult maintains corporate headquarters in Tarrytown, New York. The
Tarrytown lease agreement for approximately 24,000 square feet of corporate
headquarters space expires in 2004. Mediconsult operates out of offices in one
additional location Berwyn, Pennsylvania. Mediconsult also has employees
geographically dispersed who work out of home offices, independent or client
offices.

     Mediconsult owns or leases a variety of computers and other computer
equipment for its operational needs. This year Mediconsult significantly
upgraded and expanded its computers and related equipment in order to increase
efficiency, enhance reliability, and provide the necessary base for business
expansion.

     Mediconsult believes that its facilities and equipment are suitable and
adequate for its business as presently conducted.

Legal Proceedings

     Mediconsult's wholly-owned subsidiary, Physicians' Online is a defendant
in a lawsuit in which a former officer and director of Physicians' Online
alleges, among other things, that Physicians' Online violated securities laws
in selling stock to the former officer and that Physicians' Online breached its
employment agreement with the former officer. This action is currently in the
United States District Court in New York. Physicians' Online has made a motion
in the United States District Court action seeking dismissal of the action. By
Order dated August 14, 1997, United States District Court Judge for the
Southern District of New York (a) dismissed the first two counts of the former
officer's Amended Complaint alleging violation of certain provisions of the
Securities Act with prejudice, and (b) dismissed the third, fourth and sixth
counts of the former officer's Amended Complaint alleging securities fraud,
common law fraud and negligent misrepresentation; with leave to replead. By
letter dated November 4, 1997, the former officer notified the Court of the
former officer's decision not to replead the former officer's third, fourth and
sixth counts at this time.

     Mediconsult is party to an arbitration proceeding in New York, New York in
which the International Council of Infertility Information Dissemination is
pursuing a claim that Mediconsult has violated the exclusive sponsorship
agreement between it and Mediconsult. Mediconsult believes it has meritorious
defenses to the claims asserted in the proceeding. Settlement discussions are
currently pending in this matter.

     Mediconsult is also party to a number of other claims and lawsuits
incidental to its business.

     Mediconsult's management, based on the advice of counsel, believes that
the ultimate outcome of these matters, individually or in the aggregate, will
not have a material adverse effect on Mediconsult results of operations.

                 BENEFICIAL SECURITY OWNERSHIP OF MEDICONSULT

     The following table sets forth, as of the record date, information with
respect to the beneficial ownership of Mediconsult's common stock by (1) each
person who is known by Mediconsult to beneficially own 5% or more of
Mediconsult's outstanding common stock, (2) Mediconsult's chief executive
officer and each of the other named executive officers, as defined in the
Securities Exchange Act, (3) each director of Mediconsult, and (4) all
directors and executive officers of Mediconsult as a group. Mediconsult is not
aware of any beneficial owner of more than 5% of the outstanding common stock
other than as set forth in the following table.

     Andrx Corporation's financial statements as of December 31, 1999 and 1998
and for each of the three fiscal years in the period ended December 31, 1999
incorporated by reference in this proxy statement/prospectus and Cybear Inc.'s
financial statements as of December 31, 1999 and 1998 and for each of the two
fiscal years in the period ended December 31, 1999 and the period from February
5, 1997 (inception) through December 31, 1997 have been so included in reliance
on the reports of Arthur Andersen LLP, independent certified public
accountants, given on their authority as experts in giving said reports.

     Mediconsult's consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 1999
and 1998 and for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 1999,
included in this proxy statement/prospectus have been so included in reliance
on the report (which contains an emphasis of matter paragraph relating to
Mediconsult's need to obtain additional capital to fund operations and
liquidate liabilities in the ordinary course of business during the year ending
December 31, 2001, as described in note 21 to the financial statements) of
PricewaterhouseCoopers, independent accountants, given on the authority of said
firm as experts in accounting and auditing.

     PricewaterhouseCoopers, Hamilton, Bermuda, Mediconsult's former public
accounting firm was dismissed on June 20, 2000. Neither of
PricewaterhouseCoopers's reports on the financial statements of Mediconsult for
the past two years contained an adverse opinion or disclaimer of opinion, or
was qualified or modified as to uncertainty, audit scope or accounting
principles. Mediconsult's decision to change public accountants was approved by
both its audit committee and its full board of directors.

     During Mediconsult's two most recent fiscal years, the most recent interim
period for the quarter ended September 30, 2000 and through the date of the
filing of this proxy statement/prospectus, there were no disagreements with
PricewaterhouseCoopers on any matter of accounting principles or practices,
financial statement, disclosure or auditing scope or procedure, which
disagreement, if not resolved to the satisfaction of PricewaterhouseCoopers,
would have caused PricewaterhouseCoopers to make a reference to the subject
matter of the disagreement in connection with its reports in the financial
statements for such years.

     The firm of Ernst & Young LLP was engaged by Mediconsult on June 23, 2000,
as Mediconsult's principal public accountant to audit its financial statements
for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2000.

                       REPORT OF INDEPENDENT ACCOUNTANTS

To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of Mediconsult.com, Inc.

     In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and the
related consolidated statements of operations, changes in stockholders' equity
and of cash flows present fairly, in all material respects, the financial
position of Mediconsult.com, Inc. and its subsidiaries at December 31, 1999 and
1998, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the
three years in the period ended December 31, 1999 in conformity with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America. These financial
statements are the responsibility of the Company's management; our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on
our audits. We conducted our audits of these statements in accordance with
auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America, which
require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about
whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit
includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and
disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles
used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall
financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
reasonable basis for our opinion.

     As discussed in Note 21 to the consolidated financial statements, the
Company has incurred significant losses and negative cash flow from operations
during the nine months ended September 30, 2000 and expects these conditions to
continue for the foreseeable future. In addition, the Company is in default on
notes payable which were due on October 31, 2000. The Company has negative
working capital and needs additional capital to fund operations and liquidate
liabilities in the ordinary course of business during the year ending December
31, 2001. In connection therewith, the Company has entered into an agreement to
merge with a wholly-owned subsidiary of Andrx Corporation.

Non-cash financing and investing activities (Notes 4, 5 and 6)

The accompanying notes are an integral part of these consolidated financial
                                  statements.

                                      F-6

                             MEDICONSULT.COM, INC.

                NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

1. ORGANIZATION

     Mediconsult.com, Inc. ("Mediconsult" or the "Company") is a provider of
physician and patient-oriented healthcare information and services on the world
wide web. The Company's sites provide a source of medical information and are
designed to empower physicians and consumers through increased professional and
consumer education regarding medical conditions and treatment alternatives.
These sites also provide a destination on the Internet where visitors can
interact with others in communities centered around chronic medical conditions
and other health issues. The Company facilitates this environment through an
array of complementary services such as moderated on-line support groups and
discussion forums. The Company operates in an environment of rapid change in
technology and is dependent upon the continued services of its current
employees, consultants and subcontractors.

     The Company was originally incorporated under the laws of the State of
Colorado in October 1989. In April 1996, the Company purchased Mediconsult.com
Limited, a Bermuda corporation (MCL), through a merger in which MCL became a
wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company. In December 1996, the Company
consummated a reincorporation merger pursuant to which Mediconsult became a
Delaware corporation.

     In April 1999 the Company sold 4,800,000 shares of common stock in a
secondary public offering for $13 per share. The Company raised $56,988,792,
net of offering expenses.

2. NEED FOR FUTURE CAPITAL

     The Company has sustained losses and negative cash flows from operations
since inception and expect these conditions to continue for the foreseeable
future. At December 31, 1999 and 1998, the Company had an accumulated deficit
of $34,682,917 and $8,399,011 respectively and working capital (deficit) of
$11,171,076 and $(593,159), respectively. Management expects that available
cash resources as of December 31, 1999, in addition to future revenue generated
from clients, will be sufficient to meet anticipated needs for working capital
and capital expenditures through at least the end of the first quarter of
fiscal 2001. Although the Company believes it has sufficient resources to
support its operations, it may need to raise additional funds in order to fund
more rapid expansion, to develop new or enhance existing services or products,
to respond to competitive pressures, to acquire complementary products,
businesses or technologies and to execute its long term business strategy.
There can be no assurance that any required additional financing will be
available on terms favorable to the Company if at all. If additional funds are
raised by the issuance of equity securities, stockholders will experience
dilution of their ownership interest and these securities may have rights
senior to those of the holders of the common stock. If additional funds are
raised by the issuance of debt or preferred stock, it may subject the Company
to certain limitations of its operations, including limitations on the payment
of dividends. If adequate funds are not available or not available on
acceptable terms, the Company may need to scale back or discontinue operations,
including our inability to fund its expansion, successfully promote its brand
name, take advantage of acquisition opportunities, develop or enhance services
or respond to competitive pressures or execute its business strategy, any of
which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition
and results of operations.

3. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

     A) USE OF ESTIMATES

     The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally
     accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and
     assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and
     disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the
     financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses
     during the reporting period. Significant estimates made by management
     include allowance for doubtful accounts, valuation of intangibles,
     estimated useful lives of tangible and intangible

                                      F-7

                             MEDICONSULT.COM, INC.

          NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS--(Continued)

3. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES--(Continued)
     assets, contingencies, percentage of completion contracts, fair value of
     options and warrants and accruals. Actual results could differ from those
     estimates.

     B) BASIS OF CONSOLIDATION

     These consolidated financial statements include the accounts of
     Mediconsult and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. All intercompany balances
     and transactions have been eliminated on consolidation.

     C) REVENUE RECOGNITION

     The Company's revenues are derived primarily from the development and
     implementation of on-line marketing and advertising programs for
     pharmaceutical and other healthcare companies. Development work could
     include marketing research, focus-group testing, on-line testing of
     visitor preferences, and development of customized client web sites. Such
     revenues are recognized on the basis of contractual commitments over the
     period of each engagement using the percentage-of-completion method based
     on labor hours and costs incurred as the measure of progress towards
     completion. Provisions for contract adjustments and losses are recorded in
     the period that such items are identified. Deferred revenue represents
     amounts billed in advance of services being performed. Unbilled revenue
     represents revenue recognized but not billed. At December 31, 1999,
     unbilled revenue primarily relates to Bristol-Myers Squibb. The Company
     has billed and collected $2 million of such unbilled revenue subsequent to
     December 31, 1999.

     Revenue from the sale of banner advertisements is recognized ratably in
     the period in which the advertisement is displayed, provided that no
     significant Company obligations remain and collection is probable. Company
     obligations typically include guarantees of minimum number of
     "impressions", or times that an advertisement appears in pages viewed by
     users of our on-line properties. To the extent minimum guaranteed
     impressions are not met, the Company defers recognition of the
     corresponding revenues until the remaining guaranteed impression levels
     are achieved.

     Other revenues include licensing, Internet Service Provider subscriptions
     in connection with Physicians' Online, and electronic commerce. Revenues
     from the licensing of content are recognized ratably over the period of
     the license agreement. Subscription service revenues are recognized over
     the period that services are provided.

     D) CONCENTRATION OF CREDIT RISK

     Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to significant
     concentration of credit risk consist primarily of cash and cash
     equivalents, and accounts receivable. Cash and cash equivalents are held
     at six institutions. Accounts receivable are typically uncollateralized
     and are derived from revenues earned from pharmaceutical customers
     primarily located in the United States and Europe. Management performs
     ongoing credit evaluations of the Company's customers and maintains
     reserves for potential credit losses. One customer accounted for 75% of
     the accounts receivable and unbilled revenue balance at December 31, 1999.
     Another customer accounted for 53% of the accounts receivable and unbilled
     revenue balance at December 31, 1998. During 1999 and 1998, two customers
     accounted for 76% and 65% of total revenues, respectively.

     E) CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS

     The Company considers all highly liquid investments which have original
     maturities of three months or less, when acquired, to be cash equivalents.
     The carrying amount reported in the balance sheet for cash and cash
     equivalents approximates its fair value.

          NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS--(Continued)

3. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES--(Continued)
     F) SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT COSTS

     The Company accounts for software development in accordance with Statement
     of Financial Accounting Standards No. 86 "Accounting for Costs of Computer
     Software to Be Sold, Leased or Marketed" which requires that certain
     software product development costs incurred after establishment of
     technological feasibility has been established, be capitalized and
     amortized, commencing the general release of the software to the public,
     over the economic life of the product. To date, the Company did not incur
     such costs.

     Software acquired from third parties or obtained in business combinations
is depreciated over its useful lives.

     G) FIXED ASSETS

     Property and equipment, mainly comprised of purchased computer equipment
     and software is recorded at cost and depreciated using the straight-line
     method over their estimated useful lives of two years. The carrying
     amounts and accumulated depreciation for fixed assets sold or retired are
     eliminated from the respective accounts and gains or losses realized on
     disposition are reflected in the accompanying consolidated statements of
     operations.

     H) INTANGIBLE ASSETS

     Intangible assets are comprised mainly of software, customer lists,
     goodwill and the content and design of certain web sites. Intangible
     assets are amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated future
     periods to be benefited ranging from three to five years.

     Intangible assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes
     in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be
     recoverable. Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a
     comparison of the carrying amount of the assets to future undiscounted
     cash flows of the businesses acquired. If the assets are considered to be
     impaired, the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by
     which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the estimated fair value
     of the assets. To date, no impairment loss has occurred.

     I) MARKETING, SALES AND CLIENT SERVICES

     Advertising costs are recorded as expense the first time an advertisement
     appears. All other advertising costs are expensed as incurred. The Company
     does not incur any direct-response advertising costs.

     J) EMPLOYEE STOCK OPTION COMPENSATION

     The Company accounts for employee stock-based compensation in accordance
     with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards ("SFAS") No. 123
     "Accounting For Stock-Based Compensation." The Company recognizes as an
     expense the fair value of options granted to employees, on the date of the
     grant, and amortizes such expense over the vesting period. The fair value
     of stock options is estimated using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model
     that takes into account the exercise price, expected life of the options,
     current market price of the common stock and its expected volatility,
     expected dividends on the common stock, and the risk-free interest rate
     based on zero-coupon U.S. government issues with a remaining term equal to
     the expected life of the options.

3. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES--(Continued)
     K) CONSULTANT STOCK OPTION AND THIRD PARTY WARRANT COMPENSATION

     The fair value of options and warrants granted to non-employees for
     services rendered is recognized as an expense in accordance with EITF
     96-18, "Accounting for Equity Instruments That Are Issued to Other Than
     Employees for Acquiring, or in Conjunction with Selling, Goods or
     Services."

     L) INCOME TAXES

     The Company accounts for income taxes in accordance with the provisions of
     SFAS 109, "Accounting for Income Taxes." SFAS 109 requires that the
     Company recognize deferred tax liabilities and assets for the expected
     future tax consequences of events that have been included in the financial
     statements or tax returns. Under this method, deferred tax liabilities and
     assets are determined on the basis of the difference between the tax basis
     of assets and liabilities and their respective financial reporting amounts
     ("temporary differences") at the enacted tax rates in effect for the years
     in which the temporary differences are expected to reverse. A valuation
     allowance is established for any deferred tax assets not expected to be
     recoverable.

     M) BASIC AND DILUTED NET LOSS PER SHARE

     Basic earnings (loss) per share is computed by dividing the net loss
     available to common stockholders by the weighted average number of common
     shares outstanding during the period. Diluted earnings (loss) per share
     gives effect to all dilutive potential common shares outstanding during a
     period, consisting primarily of the incremental common shares issuable
     upon conversion of the convertible preferred stock (using the if-converted
     method) and shares issuable upon the exercise of stock options and
     warrants (using the treasury stock method). Common equivalent shares are
     excluded from the computation if their effect is anti-dilutive. Loss
     available to common shareholders is computed by increasing net loss for
     dividends declared in the period on preferred stock and the dividends
     accumulated for the period on cumulative preferred stock from net loss.

     N) COMPREHENSIVE INCOME

     In June 1997, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued
     SFAS 130, "Reporting Comprehensive Income." SFAS 130 establishes standards
     for reporting comprehensive income (loss) and its components in a
     financial statement. Comprehensive income (loss) as defined includes all
     changes in equity (net assets) during a period from non-owner sources. For
     all years presented, the Company's comprehensive loss was equal to net
     loss.

     O) SEGMENTS

     In June 1997, the FASB issued SFAS 131, "Disclosures About Segments Of An
     Enterprise And Related Information." This statement establishes standards
     for reporting information about operating segments in annual financial
     statements. It also establishes standards for related disclosures about
     products and services, geographic areas, and major customers. The Company
     operates in a single segment and therefore, the adoption of SFAS 131 has
     had no impact on the financial statements of the Company.

     P) FAIR VALUES OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

     SFAS 107 "Disclosure About The Fair Value Of Financial Instruments,"
     requires disclosure about the fair value of certain financial instruments.
     The Company's financial instruments, including cash and cash

                                      F-10

                             MEDICONSULT.COM, INC.

          NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS--(Continued)

3. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES--(Continued)
     equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued
     liabilities, notes payable and advances from shareholder are carried at
     cost which approximates their fair value because of the short-term
     maturity of these instruments.

     Q) RECLASSIFICATIONS

     Certain previously reported amounts have been reclassified to conform to
     the 1999 consolidated financial statement presentation.

     R) RECENT PRONOUNCEMENTS

     Management believes that the future adoption of recently issued accounting
     standards will not have a material impact on the Company's financial
     statements, except that the Company is currently evaluating the future
     impact that Staff Accounting Bulletin 101, "Revenue Recognition," issued
     in December 1999 by the Securities and Exchange Commission, may have on
     the Company's financial statements in the future.

4. ACQUISITIONS

     All acquisitions were accounted for as purchased business combinations
under APB 16 "Business Combinations."

     A) PHARMINFO.COM

     On December 31, 1998, the Company acquired the content and design of the
     PharmInfo.com web site in exchange for 100,000 shares of Mediconsult
     common stock. The total purchase price was $0.8 million, equivalent to the
     quoted market price of the Company's shares on the date of close, which
     was recorded as goodwill. The goodwill is being amortized on a
     straight-line basis over an estimated useful life of three years.

     B) CYBERDIET, INC.

     On May 11, 1999, the Company completed the acquisition of CyberDiet, LLC,
     which provides tailored nutritional information and programs, in exchange
     for 400,000 shares of Mediconsult common stock. The total purchase price,
     including acquisition costs and assumption of net liabilities, was $2.8
     million. The fair value of shares provided as consideration was determined
     by the market price of the shares at the announcement date (February 25,
     1999). The excess of the purchase price over net assets acquired was
     recorded as goodwill and is being amortized on a straight-line basis over
     five years.

     C) CYBER-TECH, INC.

     On June 14, 1999, the Company acquired all of the capital stock of
     Cyber-Tech, Inc. ("Cyber-Tech"), a company that has developed on-line
     content and tools focused on heart disease and related areas. The
     consideration paid to Cyber-Tech shareholders consisted of $3,765,000 in
     cash and 267,732 shares of Mediconsult common stock. Mediconsult and the
     shareholders of Cyber-Tech also entered into an escrow agreement with
     respect to certain of the shares of Mediconsult common stock issued to the
     former Cyber-Tech shareholders. The total transaction value, including
     acquisition costs, was $7.6 million. The fair value of shares provided as
     consideration was determined by the market price of the shares at the
     transaction date. The excess of the purchase price over net assets
     acquired was allocated to goodwill and other intangible assets. Goodwill
     and other intangible assets are being amortized on a straight-line basis
     over an estimated useful life of three to five years.

     D) MOOD SCIENCES, INC.

     Mood Sciences, a company that specializes in mental health disease
     management innovations, was acquired on October 27, 1999, in exchange for
     215,000 shares of Mediconsult common stock. The total purchase price,
     including acquisition costs of $0.2 million and assumption of net
     liabilities of $0.2 million, was $1.9 million. The fair value of shares
     provided as consideration was determined by the market price of the shares
     at the transaction date. The excess of the purchase price over net assets
     acquired was recorded as goodwill and is being amortized on a
     straight-line basis over five years.

     E) PHYSICIANS' ONLINE, INC.

     On December 16, 1999, the Company acquired the shares of Physicians'
     Online, Inc. ("POL"), a provider of an exclusive network for physicians in
     addition to on-line medical information and communications. POL operates a
     secure, physicians-only environment featuring access to medical databases,
     daily medical news, continuing medical education credits, clinical
     symposia, e-mail accounts, Internet access, and other services. As
     consideration for the acquisition, the Company issued approximately 18.5
     million shares of Mediconsult common stock. The total value of
     consideration was $183.1 million, including the assumption of debt and
     acquisition costs. The fair value of shares provided as consideration to
     the previous shareholders was determined by the market price of the shares
     at the announcement date (September 7, 1999). The effect on the purchase
     price of the POL vested options was computed in accordance with SFAS 123,
     the value of which was not material. Identifiable intangible assets
     resulting from the transaction are amortized over periods ranging from
     three to five years.

     A summary of the allocation of the total purchase price is as follows:

  Current Assets .........  $    419,483
  Fixed Assets ...........       430,779
  Customer list ..........     6,206,000
  Software ...............     7,730,000
  Work force .............     2,142,000

                            ============

     The fair value assigned to intangible assets acquired was based on an
     appraisal of such assets as of the date of acquisition and the assets are
     being amortized on a straight-line basis over their respective useful
     lives. The estimated useful life of software is three years, work force is
     four years, and all other intangible assets, including goodwill, have an
     estimated useful life of five years. Goodwill represents the excess of the
     purchase price over the fair value of identifiable tangible and intangible
     assets acquired.

     F) UNAUDITED PRO FORMA RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

     Had the acquisitions of Pharminfo.com, CyberDiet, Cyber-Tech, and Mood
     Sciences occurred on January 1, 1998, the unaudited pro forma revenue, net
     loss and related basic and diluted net loss per share for the years ended
     December 31, 1999 and 1998 would have been $7.0 million and $2.2 million,
     $29.5 million and $7.4 million, and $1.12 and $0.39, respectively. Had the
     acquisition of Physicians' Online, Inc. occurred on January 1, 1998, the
     unaudited pro forma revenue, net loss and related basic and diluted net
     loss per share for the years ended December 31, 1999 and 1998 would have
     been $12.0 million and $7.1 million, $74.7 million and $52.9 million, and
     $1.68 and $1.45, respectively. Had all acquisitions occurred on January 1,
     1998, the unaudited pro forma revenue, net loss and related basic and
     diluted net loss per share for the years ended December 31, 1999 and 1998
     would have been $12.6 million and $8.2 million, $77.0 million and $37.4
     million, and $1.72 and $1.48, respectively. Note that the per share data
     was adjusted to reflect the weighted average number of shares of common
     stock as a result of the acquisitions. These unaudited pro forma results
     are based on various assumptions and are not necessarily indicative of
     what would have occurred had the acquisitions been consummated on January
     1, 1998.

5. PHARMA MARKETING, LLC

     On September 7, 1999 the Company entered into various agreements
(collectively "Agreements") whereby, among other things, the Company purchased
a 35% membership interests of Pharma Marketing LLC ("Pharma"), an entity
organized to perform certain sales and marketing operations of the Company and

owned by a certain individual ("Individual"). Under the terms of the
Agreements, Pharma distributed to the individual the $1,250,000 contributed by
the Company and 100,000 of the 200,000 shares contributed by the Company. The
remaining 100,000 shares will be distributed to the individual in the future.
For financial reporting purposes, the cash contributed to Pharma have been
deemed to be cost of services provided by the Individual and as such have been
expensed. Total expense, which includes the cash contributed, other expenses,
and the fair value of Company common stock issued to the Individual, recorded
in connection with these agreements for the year ended December 31, 1999
approximated $3,730,000. The remaining 100,000 shares of the Company's common
stock to be issued to the Individual are being accounted for in accordance with
EITF 96-18. Accordingly, the Company will be required to recognize as an
expense the fair value of the shares of common stock over the vesting period.

     Mediconsult.com, Limited, a subsidiary of the Company, has entered into a
service agreement with Pharma under which Pharma agrees to provide
pharmaceutical sales and marketing services to Mediconsult.com, Limited and its
affiliates. Under this service agreement, Pharma is entitled to receive a
monthly retainer and commissions based on revenues generated under contracts
that Pharma assists in obtaining. Pharma entered into an employment agreement
with the Individual, under which, the Individual is principally responsible for
performing the services under Pharma's service agreement with Mediconsult.com,
Limited.

     Subject to certain conditions described in the operating agreement, the
members of Pharma, other than Mediconsult, have the right to put their Pharma
membership interests to the Company in exchange for shares of the Company's
common stock.

6. NON-CASH FINANCING AND INVESTING ACTIVITIES

converted to common stock. In addition, the Company assumed debt in the amount
of $5.3 million of which $4.7 million was outstanding at December 31, 1999
(Note 9). Non-cash investing activities included the acquisitions noted in
Notes 4 and 5. These resulted in a total of 19,446,569 shares being issued with
a deemed value of $166.8 million.

9. NOTES PAYABLE

     Notes payable consist of advances from POL's shareholders made to provide
POL with working capital prior to the acquisition by Mediconsult. The notes
bear interest at 11% and are repayable as follows:

  February 29, 2000 .........  $2,639,551
  October 31, 2000 ..........   2,334,549

     Accrued interest payable at December 31, 1999 in the amount of $477,276 is
included in accounts payable and accrued liabilities. Subsequent to December
31, 1999, the Company had repaid the notes payable which were due on February
29, 2000.

10. ADVANCES FROM SHAREHOLDER

     Advances from shareholder are interest free and repayable on demand.

11. CAPITAL STOCK

     SENIOR PREFERRED STOCK

     On February 26, 1999, the Company sold in a private placement an aggregate
     of 506,329 shares of newly designated voting senior preferred stock at
     $6.32 per share and warrants exercisable for five years to purchase
     224,000 shares of the senior preferred stock at $6.32 per share to Nazem &
     Company IV, L.P. Transatlantic Venture Fund C.V. (a joint venture of Nazem
     & Company and Banque Nationale de Paris) and certain other individual
     investors, for an aggregate of $3.2 million. The senior preferred stock
     contains a redemption provision whereby the holder has the option to
     receive $6.32 per share, plus declared and unpaid dividends, at any time
     after February 25, 2003. In addition, the Company has recognized a senior
     preferred stock dividend of approximately $859,000. Such amount represents
     the intrinsic value of the beneficial conversion feature using the
     conversion terms that are most beneficial to the holders. During April
     1999, all shares of senior preferred stock and accumulated dividends were
     converted into an equal number of common shares. As of December 31, 1999
     the 224,000 warrants remain outstanding, however such warrants are
     exercisable into an equal number of shares of common stock.

          NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS--(Continued)

11. CAPITAL STOCK--(Continued)

     JUNIOR PREFERRED STOCK

     In September 1998, the board of directors and the stockholders,
     respectively, approved an amendment (the "Amendment") to the Certificate
     of Designation of the Preferred Stock to, among other things, change the
     existing $10 Non-Cumulative Preferred Stock to a cumulative preferred
     stock and change the name to "Preferred Stock". Under the amendment each
     issued and outstanding share of preferred stock entitles the holder of
     record to receive cumulative dividends payable in additional shares of
     preferred stock at the rate of 8% per annum, payable semi-annually. Each
     share of preferred stock is automatically convertible into shares of
     common stock, subject to an adjustment, upon certain occurrences. The
     conversion rate of the preferred stock has standard anti-dilution
     protections in the event of stock splits, dividends, combinations, mergers
     and reorganizations, but is not protected from issuances below the base
     conversion rate. No dividends were declared prior to September 30, 1998,
     when dividends on such shares became cumulative. During April 1999, all
     shares of junior preferred stock and accumulated dividends were converted
     into 3,732,752 common shares.

12. STOCK OPTIONS

     The Company maintains its 1996 Stock Option Plan (the "Plan") to provide
incentives to employees, directors and consultants. The maximum term of options
granted under the Plan is ten years. The board of directors has the exclusive
power over the granting of options and their vesting provisions. During the
year ended December 31, 1999, the number of shares of common stock covered by
the Plan was increased from 2,500,000 to 7,000,000.

     Stock options for common stock comprise:

     During the years ended December 31, 1999 and 1998 the fair values of the
options granted to employees, recognized as deferred expense, excluding options
converted from Physicians' Online in 1999, were $13,162,050 and $1,045,976
respectively. The weighted average exercise price and weighted average fair
value of options whose exercise price was less than the market value at the
grant date during 1999 were $11.43 and $8.71, respectively. The weighted
average exercise price and weighted average fair value of options whose
exercise price was equal to the market value at the grant date during 1999 were
$7.30 and $5.85, respectively. The fair value of unvested options issued in
exchange for POL options was valued at $3,841,314. Such amount will be expensed
over the remaining vesting period.

     The fair values of each option granted was estimated using the
Black-Scholes option-pricing model. The following assumptions were used in
computing the fair value of the option grants in 1999: expected volatility of
the common stock ranging between 110% and 133%; expected lives ranging from one
to five years; zero dividend yield and weighted average risk-free interest
rates ranging between 4.63% and 6.45%.

13. WARRANTS

     In addition to the warrants issued in connection with the senior preferred
stock as discussed in Note 11A, the Company issued warrants to purchase 400,000
shares of common stock at an exercise price of $1.22 per share to Arnhold and
S. Bleichroeder, Inc. in consideration of investment advisory services. These
warrants have been delivered or are being held in escrow and are deliverable as
follows: 200,000 were delivered upon initial filing of Mediconsult's secondary
offering prospectus in April 1999 and have been exercised; 100,000 were
delivered on March 15, 2000; and 100,000 will be delivered on September 15,
2000. The delivery of the remaining 100,000 warrants is subject to the
continued performance of financial advisory services for the Company by a
particular individual on behalf of this firm. Such remaining 100,000 warrants
deliverable in 2000, are being accounted for in accordance with EITF 96-18.
Accordingly, the Company will be required to recognize as an expense the fair
value of the warrants over the vesting period. These warrants, which expire on
March 1, 2004, have net issue election and anti-dilution provisions comparable
to the senior preferred stock warrants. These warrants do not confer upon the
holder any voting or any other right of a stockholder. Total expense associated
with these warrants was $1.8 million during 1999.

14. EARNINGS PER SHARE

     For each of the years ended December 31, 1999, 1998 and 1997, the Company
reported net losses and, therefore, common stock equivalents were not included
in the calculation of diluted earnings per share since such inclusion would
have been anti-dilutive. The following common stock equivalents have been
excluded from diluted per share amounts because their effect would have been
anti-dilutive:

15. INCOME TAXES

     The Company's operations are conducted by its U.S., Bermudan and Canadian
subsidiaries. The Bermuda subsidiary has received an undertaking from the
Bermuda Government exempting it from all local income, profits and capital
gains taxes until the year 2016. At the present time, no such taxes are levied
in Bermuda, however, there can be no assurance that the Bermuda subsidiary will
not be deemed to be transacting business in the U.S. by regulatory authorities
and therefore become subject to U.S. taxation. The Company and its U.S.
subsidiary are Delaware companies and the Canadian subsidiary is incorporated
under the laws of that country. The Company and its U.S. and Canadian
subsidiaries are subject to income tax, however no income tax provision has
been recorded for the years ended December 31, 1999, 1998 or 1997 as the
Company has experienced net operating losses in each year for both U.S. and
foreign income tax purposes.

     The primary difference between the Company's effective income tax rate and
the Federal statutory tax rate is attributable to the valuation allowance
recorded on all deferred tax assets and the difference between the U.S. and
foreign income tax rates.

     The tax effect of temporary differences, net operating losses and tax
credit carryforwards as of December 31, 1999 and 1998 are as follows:

                                          1999           1998

  U.S. Deferred tax assets ........  $  3,530,011    $       --
  Foreign Deferred tax assets .....     2,884,139       580,060
  Valuation allowance .............    (6,414,150)     (580,060)

                                     ============    ==========

     The Company has recorded a valuation allowance against all deferred tax
assets considering its history of net operating losses and uncertainty
regarding the Company's ability to generate sufficient taxable income in the
future to utilize these deferred tax assets.

     As of December 31, 1999 and December 31, 1998, the Company has available,
for U.S. and Canadian tax reporting purposes, net operating loss carryforwards
of approximately $16.6 million and $1.3 million respectively which will expire
in various years through 2019. In addition, at December 31, 1999 and 1998 the
Company has no undistributed foreign earnings.

     The Company has various operating leases in effect for corporate and
operating activities. The operating leases expire over the next one to five

18. LITIGATION

     The Company's wholly owned subsidiary, POL is a defendant in a lawsuit in
which a former officer and director of POL alleges, among other things, that
POL violated securities laws in selling stock to the former officer and that
POL breached its employment agreement with the former officer. This action is
currently in the United States District Court in New York. POL has made a
motion in the United States District Court action seeking dismissal of the
action. By Order dated August 14, 1997, United States District Court Judge for
the Southern District of New York (a) dismissed the first two counts of the
former officer's amended complaint alleging violation of certain provisions of
the Securities Act of 1933 with prejudice, and (b) dismissed the third, fourth
and sixth counts of the former officer's amended complaint alleging securities
fraud, common law fraud and negligent misrepresentation; with leave to replead.
By letter dated November 4, 1997, the former officer notified the Court of the
former officer's decision not to replead the former officer's third, fourth and
sixth counts at this time.

     Management, based on the advice of its legal counsel, believes that the
ultimate outcome of this action will not have a material adverse effect on the
Company's financial position or results of operations.

     The Company is also party to a number of other claims and lawsuits that
are incidental to the ordinary course of business. Management, based on the
advice of its legal counsel, believes that the outcome of any such claims and
lawsuits will not have a material adverse effect on the Company's results of
operations.

21. NEED FOR ADDITIONAL CAPITAL

     The Company has incurred significant losses and negative cash flow from
operations during the nine months ended September 30, 2000 and expects these
conditions to continue for the foreseeable future. In addition, the Company is
in default on notes payable which were due on October 31, 2000. The Company has
negative working capital and needs additional capital to fund operations and
liquidate liabilities in the ordinary course of business during the year ending
December 31, 2001. Management's current plan, which is discussed in greater
detail below, includes merging with a wholly-owned subsidiary of Andrx
Corporation ("Andrx"). In the event the Company's planned merger with Andrx is
not completed or if the Company is otherwise unable to obtain needed capital on

          NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS--(Continued)

21. NEED FOR ADDITIONAL CAPITAL--(Continued)

     In January 2001, the board of directors of the Company approved a merger
agreement with Andrx, under which the Company will become a wholly-owned
subsidiary of Andrx.

     Under the agreement, each share of common stock of the Company, issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the merger will
automatically convert into 0.1430 shares of Cybear tracking stock, subject to
adjustment. In addition, options and warrants to acquire shares of the
Company's common stock outstanding immediately before the effective time of the
merger will be assumed by Andrx and converted into options and warrants to
acquire shares of Cybear tracking stock at the rate of 0.1430 shares of Cybear
tracking stock for each share of Company common stock, subject to adjustment.
The Cybear tracking stock is a class of Andrx common stock designed to track
the financial performance of Andrx Corporation's Internet assets which are
referred to as the Cybear Group.

     In connection with the merger, the Company entered into a credit agreement
with Cybear Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of Andrx, whereby, Cybear Inc.
agreed to provide the Company with up to $2.0 million in interim financing to
fund the Company's operating activities until the effective time of the merger.
Amounts borrowed under such credit agreement are due on July 15, 2001, and
collateralized by all of the outstanding shares of common stock of Physicians
Online, Inc. (a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company). In the event that the
merger agreement is terminated, the amount due is convertible into shares of
the Company's common stock at a conversion price of $0.125 per share. In
addition, the Company issued to Cybear Inc. a warrant to purchase 8,926,502
shares of the Company's common stock at an exercise price of $0.125 per share,
exercisable at any time after the merger agreement is terminated up to January
9, 2006.

     In the event that the merger is terminated under certain conditions
defined in the merger agreement, the breaching party will pay the other party a
termination fee of $750,000. In the event that the merger agreement is
terminated under certain conditions defined in the merger agreement, the
Company will pay Andrx a termination fee of $1.0 million and will issue to
Andrx a warrant to purchase up to 19.9% of the then outstanding capital stock
of the Company.

3. WARRANTS

exercise price of $3.8125 per share in connection with consulting services
rendered by Accenture to the Company under a consulting services agreement

warrants.

4. RESTRUCTURING CHARGES

     During the third quarter of 2000, the Company initiated a restructuring
program. The restructuring is intended to reduce the Company's cost structure
for its web site operations to focus resources on its core businesses related
to educating and connecting physicians and patients. The restructuring
predominantly affects the Company's operations in its Canadian location. During
the

      NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Unaudited)--(Continued)

4. RESTRUCTURING CHARGES--(Continued)
third quarter of 2000, a charge of approximately $2.8 million was recorded with
respect to the restructuring of the Company's Canadian location and web site
operations. Approximately 100 employees were notified of terminations as
operations were curtailed in line with current demands for the company's
products. As a result 96 employees were terminated as of September 30, 2000 and
the remaining employees will be terminated by December 31, 2000. The remaining
restructuring costs relate to non-cancellable operating leases for office space
at the Canadian location and contracts for telephone and web site services.

     The following table illustrates the different components of the
restructuring accrual:

                                                                                         Other

5. IMPAIRMENT OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS

     As a result of the Company's restructuring program resulting in the
closing of its Canadian location and related operations, the Company has
realized an impairment of long-lived assets. A charge of approximately $8.3
million was recorded related to the write-off of the carrying value of goodwill
originally acquired with the purchase of the operations affected by the
restructuring. Management has determined that there are no future cash flows
associated with the goodwill. In addition, certain fixed assets used in the
restructured operations will be disposed of during the fourth quarter resulting
in a charge of approximately $0.3 million to reflect a reduction in their
carrying value to approximate their fair value, which is the estimated disposal
sales price of the fixed assets.

6. DEFAULT ON NOTES PAYABLE

     The Company is in default with respect to all of its notes payable due on
October 31, 2000, of $2.9 million including interest of $0.6 million.
Management is currently in negotiations with the holders of these notes to
arrange payment alternatives.

                           (iii)    Bylaws. Subject to Section 6(g), the bylaws

                           (iv)     Directors. The directors of Merger Sub

than conditions which by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing, but
subject to such conditions) or (b) at such other time, date or place as
Mediconsult and Andrx may agree in writing. The date on which the Closing occurs
is referred to herein as the "Closing Date."

                  (e) Effect on Capital Stock.

                           (i)      Each share of Mediconsult Common Stock
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than any
shares of Mediconsult Common Stock to be canceled pursuant to Section 2(f) or,
if applicable, any shares of Mediconsult Common Stock held by Persons who have
not voted such shares for approval of the Merger and with respect to which such
Persons shall become entitled to exercise dissenters' rights in accordance with
the DGCL (the "Dissenting Shares")) will be canceled and extinguished and be
converted automatically into the right to receive 0.1430 shares of Cybear
Tracking Stock, subject to adjustment as provided for in Section 2(q) (the
"Exchange Ratio"). 80% of the shares of Cybear Tracking Stock into which the
Mediconsult Common Stock shall be converted pursuant to this Section 2(e) shall
be issued upon surrender of the certificates representing such share of
Mediconsult Common Stock in the manner provided in Section 2(l) (or, in the case
of a lost,

                                      A-14

stolen or destroyed certificate, upon delivery of an affidavit and, if required,
bond in the manner provided in Section 2(n)). The remaining 20% of the shares of
Cybear Tracking Stock into which the Mediconsult Common Stock shall be converted
shall be issued to stockholders who have surrendered their certificates
representing shares of Mediconsult Common Stock as provided in the preceding
sentence, following the determination of any adjustment to the Exchange Ratio as
provided in Section 2(q). It is the intention of the Parties that the holders of
Mediconsult Common Stock will, as a result of the Merger, own in the aggregate
approximately 42.9% of the Cybear Tracking Stock outstanding after the Merger on
a fully diluted basis assuming no adjustment in the Exchange Ratio as provided
in Section 2(q).

                           (ii)     At the Effective Time, each outstanding
Mediconsult Option and Mediconsult Warrant shall be assumed by Andrx in
accordance with Section 6.

                  (f) Cancellation of Treasury Stock and Shares of Mediconsult
Common Stock Owned by Andrx. Each share of Mediconsult Common Stock that is
owned by Mediconsult as treasury stock immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall be canceled and extinguished without any conversion thereof. Each share of
Mediconsult Common Stock that is owned by Andrx or any direct or indirect
wholly-owned subsidiary of Andrx immediately prior to the Effective Time shall
be cancelled and extinguished without any conversion thereof.

                  (g) Unvested Mediconsult Common Stock. If any shares of
Mediconsult Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time are
unvested or are subject to a repurchase option, risk of forfeiture or other
condition under any applicable restricted stock purchase agreement, or other
agreement with Mediconsult or under which Mediconsult has any rights, then
(unless such condition terminates by virtue of the Merger pursuant to the
express term of such agreement) the shares of Cybear Tracking Stock issued in
exchange for such shares of Mediconsult Common Stock will also be unvested and
subject to the same repurchase option, risk of forfeiture or other condition,
and the certificates representing such shares of Cybear Tracking Stock may
accordingly be marked with appropriate legends. Mediconsult shall take all
action that may be necessary to ensure that, from and after the Effective Time,
Andrx is entitled to exercise any such repurchase option or other right set
forth in any such restricted stock purchase agreement or other agreement.

                  (h) Capital Stock of Merger Sub. At the Effective Time, each
share of Common Stock, par value $.001 per share, of Merger Sub ("Merger Sub
Common Stock") issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall be converted into and exchanged for one validly issued, fully paid and
nonassessable share of Common Stock, par value $.001 per share, of the Surviving
Corporation, and the Surviving Corporation shall become a wholly owned
subsidiary of Andrx. Each stock certificate of Merger Sub evidencing ownership
of any such shares shall continue to evidence ownership of such share of capital
stock of the Surviving Corporation.

                  (i) Fractional Shares. No fraction of a share of Cybear
Tracking Stock will be issued to the stockholders of Mediconsult in the Merger.
Instead, as promptly as practicable after the Effective Time, the fractional
share interests of Cybear Tracking Stock will be aggregated into whole shares of
Cybear Tracking Stock (provided that after such aggregation, the remaining
fractional share of Cybear Tracking Stock, if any, shall be rounded up to the
next

                                      A-15

whole share) and sold on the open market by the Exchange Agent. The net proceeds
from the sale will be distributed by the Exchange Agent as promptly as
practicable after the Effective Time, to the stockholders entitled to receive
such fractional share interests from Andrx in an amount of cash (rounded to the
nearest whole cent) equal to the product of such fraction, multiplied by the net
proceeds per share received by the Exchange Agent for the sale of the Cybear
Tracking Stock. Andrx shall pay the Exchange Agent's compensation and expenses
in connection with such sale.

                  (j) Exchange Agent. Andrx shall appoint American Stock
Transfer and Trust Company to serve as exchange agent (the "Exchange Agent") in
the Merger.

                  (k) Andrx to Provide Stock and Cash. Promptly after the
Effective Time, Andrx shall make available to the Exchange Agent for exchange in
accordance with Section 2(l) the shares of Cybear Tracking Stock issuable
pursuant to Section 2(l) in exchange for all of the outstanding shares of the
Mediconsult Common Stock immediately prior to the Effective Time and cash in an
amount sufficient for payment of any dividends or distributions payable pursuant
to Section 2(m).

                  (l) Exchange Procedures. Promptly after the Effective Time,
Andrx shall cause the Exchange Agent to mail to each holder of record (as of the
Effective Time) of a certificate or certificates (the "Certificates"), which
immediately prior to the Effective Time represented outstanding shares of
Mediconsult Capital Stock, whose shares were converted into shares of Cybear
Tracking Stock pursuant to Section 2(e) and any dividends or other distributions
pursuant to Section 2(m): (i) a letter of transmittal (which shall specify that
delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall
pass, only upon delivery of the Certificates to the Exchange Agent and shall
contain such other provisions as Andrx may reasonably specify) and (ii)
instructions for use in effecting the surrender of Certificates in exchange for
certificates representing shares of Cybear Tracking Stock and cash in lieu of
fractional shares pursuant to Section 2(i) and any dividends or other
distributions pursuant to Section 2(m). Upon surrender of the Certificates for
cancellation to the Exchange Agent, together with such letter of transmittal,
duly completed and validly executed in accordance with the instructions thereto,
the holders of such Certificates shall be entitled to receive in exchange
therefor certificates representing the number of whole shares of Cybear Tracking
Stock into which their shares of Mediconsult Capital Stock were converted at the
Effective Time and any dividends or distributions payable pursuant to Section
2(m), and payment in lieu of fractional shares which the holder has the right to
receive pursuant to Section 2(i) and the Certificates so surrendered shall
forthwith be canceled. Until so surrendered, outstanding Certificates will be
deemed from and after the Effective Time, for all corporate purposes, subject to
Section 2(m) as to the payment of dividends, to evidence the ownership of the
number of full shares of Cybear Tracking Stock into which such shares of
Mediconsult Capital Stock shall have been so converted (including any voting
notice or other rights associated with the ownership of such share of Cybear
Tracking Stock under the Andrx Certificate of Incorporation or the bylaws of
Andrx or under Delaware law) and the right to receive an amount in cash in lieu
of the issuance of any fractional shares in accordance with Section 2(i) and any
dividends or distributions payable pursuant to Section 2(m). If any portion of
the Cybear Tracking Stock (and any dividends or distributions thereon),
otherwise payable hereunder to any person, is to be issued or paid to a person
other than the person in whose name the Certificate is registered, it shall be a

                                      A-16

condition to such issuance or payment that the Certificate so surrendered shall
be properly endorsed or otherwise be in proper form for transfer and that the
person requesting such issuance or payment shall pay to the Exchange Agent any
transfer or other Taxes required as a result of such issuance or payment to a
person other than the registered holder of such Certificate or establish to the
satisfaction of the Exchange Agent that such Tax has been paid or is not
payable.

                  (m) Dividends; No Further Ownership Rights in Mediconsult
Capital Stock; Etc.

                           (i)      Notwithstanding any other provisions of this
Agreement, no dividends or other distributions declared after the Effective Time
on the Cybear Tracking Stock shall be paid with respect to any shares of
Mediconsult Capital Stock represented by a Certificate until such Certificate is
surrendered for exchange as provided herein. Subject to the effect of applicable
laws, following surrender of any such Certificate, there shall be paid to the
holder of the Cybear Tracking Stock certificates issued in exchange therefor,
without interest, (A) at the time of such surrender, the amount of dividends or
other distributions with a record date after the Effective Time theretofore
payable with respect to such whole shares of Cybear Tracking Stock and not paid,
less the amount of any withholding Taxes which may be required thereon and (B)
at the appropriate payment date, the amount of dividends or other distributions
with a record date after the Effective Time but prior to surrender and a payment
date subsequent to surrender payable with respect to such shares of Cybear
Tracking Stock, less the amount of any withholding Taxes which may be required
thereon.

                           (ii)     All shares of the Cybear Tracking Stock
issued upon surrender of Certificates in accordance with this Section 2 shall be
deemed to be in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the shares of
Mediconsult Capital Stock represented thereby, and from and after the Effective
Time, there shall be no transfers on the stock transfer books of Mediconsult of
the shares of Mediconsult Capital Stock. If, after the Effective Time,
certificates representing any such shares are presented to the Surviving
Corporation, they shall be canceled and exchanged for certificates for the
consideration deliverable in respect thereof pursuant to this Agreement in
accordance with the procedures set forth in Section 2(l).

                           (iii)    Upon demand by Andrx, the Exchange Agent
shall deliver to Andrx any portion of the Cybear Tracking Stock made available
to the Exchange Agent pursuant to Section 2(k) hereof, and cash in lieu of
fractional shares thereof, that remains undistributed to holders of Mediconsult
Capital Stock one year after the Effective Time. Holders of Certificates who
have not complied with this Section 2 prior to such demand shall thereafter look
only to Andrx for payment of any claim to such Cybear Tracking Stock and
dividends or distributions, if any, in respect thereof.

                           (iv)     The Surviving Corporation and Andrx shall be
entitled to deduct and withhold from the Cybear Tracking Stock (and any
dividends or distributions thereon), otherwise payable hereunder, to any person
such amounts as it is required to deduct and withhold with respect to making of
such payment under any provision of federal, state, local or foreign income Tax
law. To the extent that the Surviving Corporation or Andrx so withholds those
amounts, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this
Agreement as having been paid to the holder of Mediconsult Capital Stock in
respect of which such deduction and withholding was made by the Surviving
Corporation or Andrx, as the case may be.

                                      A-17

                  (n) Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates. In the event that
any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an
affidavit of that fact by the person claiming such Certificate to be lost,
stolen or destroyed and, if required by Andrx, the posting by such person of a
bond in such reasonable amount as Andrx may direct as indemnity against any
claim that may be made against it with respect to such Certificate, the Exchange
Agent will issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the
applicable merger consideration and unpaid dividend and distributions on shares
of Cybear Tracking Stock deliverable in respect thereof pursuant to this
Agreement.

                  (o) Dissenters' Rights. Any Dissenting Shares shall not be
converted into shares of Cybear Tracking Stock but shall instead be converted
into the right to receive such consideration as may be determined to be due with
respect to such Dissenting Shares pursuant to the DGCL. Mediconsult agrees that,
except with the prior written consent of Andrx, or as required under the DGCL,
it will not voluntarily make any payment with respect to, or settle or offer to
settle, any such purchase demand. Each holder of Dissenting Shares who, pursuant
to the provisions of the DGCL, becomes entitled to payment of the fair value for
shares of Mediconsult Common Stock shall receive payment therefor (but only
after the value therefor shall have been agreed upon or finally determined
pursuant to such provisions). If, after the Effective Time, any Dissenting
Shares shall lose their status as Dissenting Shares, Andrx shall issue and
deliver, upon surrender by such stockholder of the certificate or certificates
representing shares of Mediconsult Common Stock, the number of shares of Cybear
Tracking Stock to which such stockholder would otherwise be entitled under
Section 2(e) and the Agreement.

                  (p) Tax Consequences. It is intended by the parties hereto
that the Andrx Merger shall constitute a reorganization within the meaning of
Section 368(a)(1)(A) (by reason of Section 368(a)(2)(E)) of the Code. The
parties hereto adopt this Agreement as a "plan of reorganization" within the
meaning of Section 1.368-2(g) and 1.368-3(a) of the United States Income Tax
Regulations.

                  (q) Adjustment to Exchange Ratio.

                           (i)      Closing Balance Sheet. As promptly as
practicable, but in any event within 90 calendar days following the Closing
Date, Andrx shall deliver to the Stockholder Representative a balance sheet as
of the closing date (the "Closing Balance Sheet"), together with a report
thereon of Andrx's Accountants stating that the Closing Balance Sheet fairly
presents the financial condition of Mediconsult as of the Closing Date in
conformity with GAAP, except as hereinafter provided, applied on a basis
consistent with the preparation of the Mediconsult Balance Sheet and in
accordance with the requirements of this Agreement.

                           (ii)     Adjustment. The Closing Balance Sheet shall
be deemed final, conclusive and binding for the purposes of this Section 2(q)
upon the date (the "Adjustment Date") that is the earliest of (A) the failure of
the Stockholder Representative to notify Andrx of a dispute within 20 business
days after the post-marked date or the Stockholder Representative's receipted
date of Andrx's delivery of the Closing Balance Sheet to the Stockholder
Representative, (B) the resolution of all disputes pursuant to Section 2(q)(iii)
by Andrx's Accountants and Mediconsult's Accountants, and (C) the resolution of
all disputes, pursuant to

                                      A-18

Section 2(q)(iii) by the Independent Accountants. In the event that the amount
of the total stockholders equity as shown on the Closing Balance Sheet (the
"Mediconsult Stockholders Equity") is less than the amounts set forth on
Schedule 2(q) (the "Base Stockholders Equity"), then, within three business days
after the Adjustment Date the Exchange Ratio shall be adjusted downward by
0.0128 of a share of Cybear Tracking Stock for each $250,000 by which the Base
Stockholders Equity exceeds the Mediconsult Stockholder Equity (the "Deficit
Amount") up to a maximum of 0.0286 of a share of Cybear Trading Stock.

                           (iii)    Disputes.

                                    (1) Subject to clause (2) of this Section
2(q)(iii), the Closing Balance Sheet delivered by Andrx to the Stockholder
Representative shall be deemed to be and shall be final, conclusive and binding
upon the Parties hereto. The Closing Balance Sheet shall be prepared in
accordance with GAAP on the basis of Mediconsult's historical accounting
practices, consistently applied and shall set forth information and financial
data in form and substance consistent with the comparable information and
financial data set forth in the Mediconsult Financial Statements.

                                    (2) The Stockholder Representative may
dispute the Deficit Amount reflected on the Closing Balance Sheet on the basis
that the amount was not arrived at in accordance with GAAP, applied on a basis
consistent with the preparation of the Mediconsult Balance Sheet (or on the
basis of any judgments made under GAAP); provided, however, that the Stockholder
Representative shall have notified Andrx and Andrx's Accountants in writing of
each disputed item, specifying the amount thereof in dispute and setting forth,
in reasonable detail, the basis for such dispute, within 15 business days after
the date of Andrx's delivery of the Closing Balance Sheet to the Stockholder
Representative. In the event of such a dispute, the Stockholder Representative
may cause Mediconsult's Accountants to inspect the Closing Balance Sheet, and
Mediconsult's Accountants shall have access to any work papers prepared by Andrx
or Andrx's Accountants in the preparation of the Closing Balance Sheet. Upon
completion of the review by Mediconsult's Accountants, which review shall be
completed within ten business days after the date of the Stockholder
Representative's written notice referred to in the first sentence of this
subsection, Mediconsult's Accountants and Andrx's Accountants shall attempt to
reconcile their differences, and any resolution by them as to any disputed
amounts shall be final, conclusive and binding on the Parties hereto. If
Mediconsult's Accountants and Andrx's Accountants are unable to reach a
resolution within 30 business days after the date of the Stockholder
Representative written notice of dispute, Mediconsult's Accountants and Andrx's
Accountants shall submit the items remaining in dispute for resolution to a
nationally recognized accounting firm reasonably acceptable to Mediconsult's
Accountants and Andrx's Accountants (the "Independent Accountants"), which
shall, within 30 business days after such submission, determine and report to
the Stockholder Representative and Andrx upon such remaining disputed items, and
such report shall be final, conclusive and binding on the Stockholder
Representative and Andrx. The fees and disbursements of the Independent
Accountants shall be shared equally by Andrx and the Stockholder Representative.

                                    (3) The resolution of disputed matters with
respect to the Closing Balance Sheet pursuant to the provisions of this Section
2(q) shall not preclude, restrict or

                                      A-19

otherwise adversely affect any of Andrx's rights to indemnification or other
legal remedies under this Agreement.

                                    (4)(i) Subject to the terms and conditions
of this Section 2(q), Ian Sutcliffe is designated as the representative of the
Mediconsult Stockholders (the "Stockholder Representative") by Mediconsult on
behalf of each of the Mediconsult Stockholders to serve, and Andrx hereby
acknowledges that the Stockholder Representative shall serve, as the sole
representative of the Mediconsult Stockholders from and after the Effective Time
with respect to the matters set forth in this Section 2(q). The Stockholder
Representative shall serve in such capacity without compensation except for the
reimbursement of out-of-pocket expenses and indemnification specifically
provided herein. The Stockholder Representative has accepted such designation as
of the date hereof. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this
Agreement, the Stockholder Representative shall have no duties or
responsibilities except those expressly set forth herein, and no implied
covenants, functions, responsibilities, duties, obligations or liabilities on
behalf of any Mediconsult Stockholders shall otherwise exist against the
Stockholder Representative.

                                    (ii)     Each of the Mediconsult
Stockholders by voting in favor of this Agreement at the Mediconsult
Stockholders Meeting and/or by acceptance or receipt of any portion of the
consideration to be paid pursuant to Section 2(e) will and hereby does,
effective as of the Effective Time, irrevocably appoint the Stockholder
Representative as the agent, proxy and attorney-in-fact for such Mediconsult
Stockholder for all purposes of this Section 2(q), including full power and
authority on such Mediconsult Stockholder's behalf (i) to take all actions which
the Stockholder Representative considers necessary or desirable in connection
with the defense, pursuit or settlement of any determinations relating to this
Section 2(q), (ii) to engage and employ agents and representatives (including
accountants, legal counsel and other professionals) and to incur such other
expenses as he shall deem necessary or prudent in connection with the
administration of the foregoing; (iii) to provide for all expenses incurred in
connection with the administration of the foregoing to be paid by directing
Andrx to reimburse the Stockholder Representative for such expenses; (iv) to
accept and receive notices to the Mediconsult Stockholders pursuant to this
Agreement; and (v) to take all other actions and exercise all other rights which
the Stockholder Representative (in his sole discretion) considers necessary or
appropriate in connection with this Agreement. Each of the Mediconsult
Stockholders, by voting in favor of this Agreement at the Mediconsult
Stockholders Meeting and/or by acceptance or receipt of any portion of the
consideration to be paid pursuant to Section 2(e), agrees that such agency and
proxy are coupled with an interest, and are therefore irrevocable without the
consent of the Stockholder Representative and shall survive the death,
incapacity, bankruptcy, dissolution or liquidation of any Mediconsult
Stockholder. All decisions and acts by the Stockholder Representative shall be
binding upon all of the Mediconsult Stockholders, and no Mediconsult Stockholder
shall have the right to object, dissent, protest or otherwise contest the same.

                                    (iii)    If the Stockholder Representative
shall die, become incapacitated, resign or otherwise fail to act on behalf of
the Mediconsult Stockholders for any reason, the Stockholder Representative
shall be such other person as shall be selected by a majority of the persons
serving as directors of Mediconsult immediately prior to the Closing, and

                                      A-20

such substituted representative shall be deemed to be the Stockholder
Representative for all purposes of this Agreement.

                                    (iv)     The Stockholder Representative is
authorized to act on the Mediconsult Stockholders' behalf notwithstanding any
dispute or disagreement among the Mediconsult Stockholders and the other Parties
shall be entitled to rely on any and all action taken by the Stockholder
Representative without any liability to, or obligation to inquire of, any of the
Mediconsult Stockholders even if such Party shall be aware of any actual or
potential dispute or disagreement among the Mediconsult Stockholders. Each of
the other Parties hereto is expressly authorized to rely on the genuineness of
the signature of the Stockholder Representative and, upon receipt of any writing
which reasonably appears to have been signed by the Stockholder Representative,
the other Parties hereto may act upon the same without any further duty of
inquiry as to the genuineness of the writing.

                                    (v)      Neither the Stockholder
Representative nor any agent employed by him shall be liable to any of the
Mediconsult Stockholders relating to the performance of his duties under this
Agreement for any errors in judgment, negligence, oversight, breach of duty or
otherwise except to the extent it is finally determined in a court of competent
jurisdiction by clear and convincing evidence that the actions taken or not
taken by the Stockholder Representative constituted fraud or were taken or not
taken in bad faith. The Stockholder Representative shall be indemnified and held
harmless by Andrx against all damages to be paid or incurred in connection with
any action, suit proceeding or claim to which the Stockholder Representative is
made a party by reason of the fact that he was acting as the Stockholder
Representative pursuant to this Agreement; provided, however, that the
Stockholder Representative shall not be entitled to indemnification hereunder to
the extent it is finally determined in a court of competent jurisdiction that
the actions taken or not taken by the Stockholder Representative constituted
fraud or were taken or not taken in bad faith. The Stockholder Representative
shall be protected in acting upon any notice, statement or certificate believed
by him to be genuine and to have been furnished by the appropriate person and in
acting or refusing to act in good faith or any matter.

                  (r) Taking of Necessary Action, Further Action. If, at any
time after the Effective Time, any further action is necessary or desirable to
carry out the purposes of this Agreement and to vest the Surviving Corporation
with full right, title and possession to all assets, property, rights,
privileges, powers and franchises of Mediconsult and Merger Sub, the officers
and directors of Andrx, Mediconsult and Merger Sub are fully authorized in the
name of their respective companies or otherwise to take, and will take, all such
lawful and necessary action, so long as such action is not inconsistent with
this Agreement.

         3. Representations and Warranties of Mediconsult. Mediconsult
represents and warrants to Andrx and Merger Sub that the statements contained in
this Section 3 are correct and complete as of the date of this Agreement and
will be correct and complete as of the Closing Date (as though made then and as
though the Closing Date were substituted for the date of this Agreement
throughout this Section 3), except as disclosed in or contemplated by the
Mediconsult Public Reports or as set forth on the disclosure schedule
accompanying this Agreement and initialed by the Parties (the "Disclosure
Schedule"). The Disclosure Schedule will be arranged in paragraphs corresponding
to the lettered and numbered paragraphs contained in this Section 3.

                                      A-21

                  (a) Organization, Qualification, and Corporate Power. Each of
Mediconsult and its Subsidiaries is a corporation duly organized, validly
existing, and in good standing under the laws of the jurisdiction of its
incorporation. Each of Mediconsult and its Subsidiaries is duly authorized to
conduct business and is in good standing under the laws of each jurisdiction
where such qualification is required, except where the lack of such
qualification would not have a material adverse effect on the business,
operations, results of operations, assets, liabilities or financial condition of
Mediconsult or Physicians' Online, or on the ability of the Parties to
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (a "Mediconsult
Material Adverse Effect"); it being understood, however, that Mediconsult's
continuing to incur losses, as long as such losses are in the Ordinary Course of
Business, shall not, alone, be deemed to be a Mediconsult Material Adverse
Effect. Each of Mediconsult and its Subsidiaries has full corporate power and
authority to carry on the businesses in which it is engaged and to own and use
the properties owned and used by it. Mediconsult has delivered or made available
to Andrx a true and correct copy of the certificate or articles of
incorporation, as amended, and bylaws, as amended, and any other charter or
organizational documents, each as amended, of Mediconsult and each of its
Subsidiaries. Neither Mediconsult nor any of its Subsidiaries is in violation of
any of the provisions of its certificate or articles of incorporation or bylaws
or other charter or organizational documents, each as amended. Mediconsult is
the owner of all outstanding shares of capital stock or voting securities of
each of its Subsidiaries, except for Pharma Marketing, LLC, which is 35% owned
by Mediconsult, and all such shares and voting securities are duly authorized,
validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable. All of the outstanding shares of
capital stock and voting securities of each such Subsidiary are owned by
Mediconsult, free and clear of all Security Interests or rights of others. There
are no outstanding subscriptions, options, warrants, puts, calls, rights,
exchangeable or convertible securities or other commitments or agreements of any
character relating to the issued or unissued capital stock or other securities
of any such Subsidiary, or otherwise obligating Mediconsult or any such
Subsidiary to issue, transfer, sell, purchase, redeem or otherwise acquire any
such securities. The Disclosure Schedule sets forth all of Mediconsult's
Subsidiaries. Mediconsult does not directly or indirectly own any equity or
similar interest in, or any interest convertible or exchangeable or exercisable
for, any equity or similar interest in, any other corporation, partnership,
joint venture or other business association or entity.

                  (b) Capitalization. The entire authorized capital stock of
Mediconsult consists of 100,000,000 shares of Mediconsult Common Stock, of which
54,190,636 shares are issued and outstanding, and 5,000,000 shares of preferred
stock, each with a par value of $.001 per share, none of which are issued and
outstanding. All of the issued and outstanding shares of Mediconsult Common
Stock have been duly authorized and are validly issued, fully paid, and
nonassessable and are free and clear of any liens or encumbrances other than any
liens or encumbrances created by or imposed upon the holders thereof, and are
not subject to preemptive rights or rights of first refusal created by statute,
the Mediconsult Certificate of Incorporation or bylaws, each as amended, or any
agreement to which Mediconsult is a party or by which it is bound. As of the
close of business on December 31, 2000, Mediconsult has reserved an aggregate of
7,345,270 shares of Mediconsult Common Stock, net of exercises, for issuance to
employees, consultants and directors pursuant to the Mediconsult Option Plans,
of which 3,358,375 shares have been issued pursuant to option exercises or
direct stock purchases, and 3,986,895 shares are subject to outstanding,
unexercised options. As of the close of business on December 31, 2000, there
were 1,703,425 shares of Mediconsult Common Stock issuable

                                      A-22

pursuant to the Mediconsult Warrants. Since September 30, 2000, Mediconsult has
not issued or granted additional options under the Mediconsult Option Plans or
otherwise. Mediconsult has not issued or granted any stock appreciation rights
or performance units under the Mediconsult Option Plans or otherwise. Except for
the rights created pursuant to this Agreement, the Mediconsult Option Plans or
the Mediconsult Warrants, there are no other options, warrants, calls, rights,
commitments or agreements of any character to which Mediconsult is a party or by
which it is bound obligating Mediconsult to issue, deliver, sell, repurchase or
redeem, or cause to be issued, delivered, sold, repurchased or redeemed, any
shares of Mediconsult Capital Stock or obligating Mediconsult to grant, extend,
accelerate the vesting of, change the price of, or otherwise amend or enter into
any such option, warrant, call, right, commitment or agreement. Except for this
Agreement or contemplated hereunder, there are no contracts, commitments or
agreements relating to voting, purchase or sale of Mediconsult Capital Stock (i)
between or among Mediconsult and any of the Mediconsult Stockholders or (ii) to
Mediconsult's Knowledge, between or among any of the Mediconsult Stockholders.
To the extent not terminated prior to Closing, the terms of the Mediconsult
Option Plans and the Mediconsult Warrants permit the assumption of options or
warrants, respectively, to purchase Mediconsult Common Stock as provided in this
Agreement, without the consent or approval of the holders of such securities,
the Mediconsult Stockholders, or otherwise. Since May 1, 1999, none of the forms
of agreements and instruments relating to or issued under the Mediconsult Option
Plans have been amended, modified or supplemented, and there are no agreements
to amend, modify or supplement such agreements or instruments in any case from
the existing forms. All outstanding shares of Mediconsult Common Stock and all
Mediconsult Options and Mediconsult Warrants were issued in compliance with all
applicable federal and state securities laws.

                  (c) Authorization of Transaction. Mediconsult has full power
and authority (including full corporate power and authority) to execute and
deliver this Agreement and to perform its obligations hereunder; provided,
however, that Mediconsult cannot consummate the Merger unless and until it
receives the Required Mediconsult Stockholder Vote and the Certificate of Merger
is filed and recorded pursuant to the DGCL. Assuming the due authorization,
execution and delivery by Andrx and Merger Sub, this Agreement constitutes the
valid and legally binding obligation of Mediconsult, enforceable in accordance
with its terms and conditions except as such enforcement may be limited by (i)
the effect of bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, receivership,
conservatorship, arrangement, moratorium or other laws affecting or relating to
the rights of creditors generally, or (ii) the rules governing the availability
of specific performance, injunctive relief or other equitable remedies and
general principles of equity, regardless of whether considered in a proceeding
in equity or at law.

                  (d) Noncontravention. Neither the execution and the delivery
of this Agreement, nor the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby,
will (i) subject to obtaining the Required Mediconsult Stockholder Vote and (w)
the filing of the Registration Statement with the SEC in accordance with the
Securities Act, (x) the filing of the Certificate of Merger with the Secretary
of State of the State of Delaware, (y) the filing of the Proxy
Statement/Prospectus with the SEC in accordance with the Securities Act and the
Securities Exchange Act and (z) obtaining or filing such consents, approvals,
orders, authorizations, registrations, declarations and filings as may be
required under applicable federal and state securities laws and the HSR Act
(clauses (w) through (z), collectively, the "Required Filings") violate any
constitution, statute, regulation, rule, injunction, judgment, order, decree,
ruling, charge, Governmental Permit or other restriction

                                      A-23

of any Governmental Entity, or court to which any of Mediconsult and its
Subsidiaries is subject; (ii) violate any provision of the charter or bylaws of
any of Mediconsult and its Subsidiaries or; (iii) conflict with, result in a
breach of, constitute a default under, result in the acceleration of, create in
any party the right to accelerate, terminate, modify, or cancel, or require any
notice under any agreement, contract, lease, license, instrument or other
arrangement to which any of Mediconsult and its Subsidiaries is a party or by
which it is bound or to which any of its assets is subject (or result in the
imposition of any Security Interest upon any of its assets), except, in the
cases of (i) and (iii), where the violation, conflict, breach, default,
acceleration, termination, modification, cancellation, or failure to give notice
would not have a Mediconsult Material Adverse Effect. Other than the Required
Filings, none of Mediconsult and its Subsidiaries are required to give any
notice to, make any filing with, or obtain any authorization, consent, or
approval of any government or Governmental Entity in order for the Parties to
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Mediconsult is not
aware of any reason why the approvals of any Governmental Entities necessary to
permit consummation of the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement will not be received without the imposition of a condition or
requirement that would have a Mediconsult Material Adverse Effect.

                  (e) Filings with the SEC. Since January 1, 1999, Mediconsult
has made all filings with the SEC that it has been required to make under the
Securities Act and the Securities Exchange Act (collectively, the "Mediconsult
Public Reports"). Each of the Mediconsult Public Reports has complied in all
material respects with the Securities Act and the Securities Exchange Act in
effect as of their respective dates (or if amended or superseded by a filing
prior to the date of this Agreement, then on the date of such filing). None of
the Mediconsult Public Reports, as of their respective dates (or if amended or
superseded by a filing prior to the date of this Agreement, then on the date of
such filing), contained any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to
state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements made therein, in
light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading except to
the extent corrected by a subsequently filed Mediconsult Public Report.
Mediconsult has delivered or made available to Andrx a correct and complete copy
of each Mediconsult Public Report (together with all exhibits and schedules
thereto and as amended to date) and will promptly make available to Andrx all
Mediconsult Public Reports and the exhibits thereto filed after the date hereof
and prior to the Effective Time. Except as would not have a Mediconsult Material
Adverse Effect, all documents required to be filed as exhibits to the
Mediconsult Public Reports have been so filed, and all material contracts so
filed as exhibits are in full force and effect, except those which have expired
in accordance with their terms, and neither Mediconsult nor any of its
Subsidiaries is in material default thereunder.

                  (f) Financial Statements. The financial statements included in
the Mediconsult Public Reports and as otherwise provided to Andrx (the
"Mediconsult Financial Statements") were complete and correct in all material
respects as of their respective dates, comply in all material respects with the
Securities Exchange Act and the rules and regulations of the SEC promulgated
thereunder and have been prepared in accordance with GAAP applied on a
consistent basis throughout the periods covered thereby (except as may be
indicated in the notes thereto or, in the case of unaudited financial
statements, as may be permitted by the SEC on Form 10-Q under the Securities
Exchange Act), present fairly the financial condition of Mediconsult and its
Subsidiaries as of the indicated dates and the results of operations of
Mediconsult and its Subsidiaries for the indicated periods, are correct and
complete in all

                                      A-24

material respects as of their respective dates, and are consistent with the
books and records of Mediconsult and its Subsidiaries, except that the unaudited
interim financial statements were or are subject to normal and recurring
year-end adjustments which were not, or are not expected to be, material in
amount.

                  (g) Events Subsequent to Most Recent Mediconsult Fiscal Period
End. Since September 30, 2000 (the "Most Recent Mediconsult Fiscal Period End"),
Mediconsult has conducted its business in the Ordinary Course of Business and
there has not occurred, (i) any change, event or condition (whether or not
covered by insurance) that has resulted in, or would result in, a Mediconsult
Material Adverse Effect; provided, however, that for purposes of this section
3(g), the occurrence of any of the following events or circumstances, in and of
themselves and in combination with any of the others, shall not constitute a
Mediconsult Material Adverse Effect: (A) circumstances, changes in, or effects
on Mediconsult or its business caused by (x) changes in its business plan or
methods of operations made at the request of Andrx or (y) actions taken or
decisions made by Andrx, (B) any adverse change, event or effect that is caused
primarily by conditions generally affecting the United States economy, (C) any
adverse change, event or effect that is caused primarily by conditions generally
affecting the healthcare, technology, Internet or service industries, or (D) any
adverse change that is demonstrated to be attributable primarily to the
announcement or discovery of this Agreement and the transactions contemplated
hereby (including employee attrition or any loss of business relationships),
unless such change resulted from a breach by Mediconsult of its obligations
under this Agreement; (ii) any acquisition, sale or transfer of any asset
material to the ongoing business of Mediconsult or any of its Subsidiaries other

revaluation by Mediconsult of any of its or any of its Subsidiaries' assets,
except as required by GAAP; (iv) any declaration, setting aside, or payment of a
dividend or other distribution with respect to the Mediconsult Capital Stock, or
any direct or indirect redemption, purchase or other acquisition by Mediconsult
of any of its shares of the Mediconsult Capital Stock; (v) any contract entered
into by Mediconsult or any of its Subsidiaries, other than in the Ordinary
Course of Business, or any amendment or termination of, or default under, any
contract to which Mediconsult or any of its Subsidiaries is a party or by which
it is bound, which individually or in the aggregate would have a Mediconsult
Material Adverse Effect; (vi) any amendment or change to the Mediconsult
Certificate of Incorporation or bylaws of Mediconsult; (vii) any increase in or
modification (other than a decrease in compensation or other benefits) of the
compensation or benefits payable or to become payable by Mediconsult to any of
its directors, officers or employees (except in the case of employees (other
than officers) increases (x) in the Ordinary Course of Business or (y) as
required by any relevant employee agreement or option agreement); (viii) any
change in the interest rate risk management and hedging policies, procedures or
practices of Mediconsult or any of its Subsidiaries, or any failure to comply
with such policies, procedures and practices; or (ix) any negotiation or
agreement by Mediconsult or any of its Subsidiaries to do any of the things
described in the preceding clauses (i) through (viii) (other than negotiations
with Andrx and its representatives regarding the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement).

                                      A-25

                  (h) Undisclosed Liabilities. Neither Mediconsult nor any of
its Subsidiaries has any obligations or liabilities (contingent or otherwise)
except obligations and liabilities (i) that are fully accrued or provided for in
all material respects in the consolidated balance sheet of Mediconsult as of
November 30, 2000, (the "Mediconsult Balance Sheet") in accordance with GAAP, or
disclosed in the notes therein in accordance with GAAP or (ii) that were
incurred after the Most Recent Mediconsult Fiscal Period End in the Ordinary
Course of Business (none of which results from, arises out of, relates to, is in
the nature of, or was caused by any breach of contract, breach of warranty,
tort, infringement, or violation of law). All material agreements currently in
effect, including all material agreements, arrangements or understandings with
directors and officers of Mediconsult, are filed as exhibits to Mediconsult
Public Reports.

                  (i) Litigation. Neither Mediconsult nor any of its
Subsidiaries is (i) subject to any outstanding injunction, judgment, order,
decree, ruling, or charge, which would have a Mediconsult Material Adverse
Effect, or (ii) a party to or, to Mediconsult's Knowledge, threatened to be made
a party to, any action, suit, proceeding, hearing, or investigation of, in, or
before any Governmental Entity or before any arbitrator which would have a
Mediconsult Material Adverse Effect.

                  (j) Restrictions on Business Activities. There is no
agreement, judgment, injunction, order or decree binding upon Mediconsult or any
of its Subsidiaries which has had or would have the effect of prohibiting or
impairing any current business practice of Mediconsult or any of its
Subsidiaries, any acquisition of property by Mediconsult or any of its
Subsidiaries or the conduct of business by Mediconsult or any of its
Subsidiaries as currently conducted by Mediconsult or any of its Subsidiaries.

                  (k) Compliance With Laws. Each of Mediconsult and its
Subsidiaries has complied in all respects with all applicable federal, state,
local, self-regulatory and foreign laws, statutes, ordinances, rules and

incorporation or bylaws or other charter or organizational documents, each as
amended, or any federal, state, local, self-regulatory or foreign statute, law,
ordinance, rule or regulation applicable to the conduct of its business or the
ownership or operation of its business, except where such noncompliance or
violation would not have a Mediconsult Material Adverse Effect.

                  (l) Title to Property. Mediconsult and its Subsidiaries have
good, valid and marketable title to, or in the case of leased properties and
assets, valid leasehold interests in, all of their respective properties,

The plants, property and equipment of Mediconsult and its Subsidiaries that are
used in the operations of their businesses are in good operating condition and
repair, subject to normal wear and tear. All properties used in the operations

Sheet to the extent GAAP requires the same to be reflected. Schedule 3(l) of the
Disclosure Schedule identifies each parcel of real property owned or leased by
Mediconsult or any of its Subsidiaries.

Adverse Effect.

                                      A-28

                           (vi)     Copyrights.

Effect.

                           (vii)    Trade Secrets.

                                    (1) Mediconsult and its Subsidiaries have
taken reasonable precautions to protect the secrecy, confidentiality, and value

                                    (2) Either Mediconsult or a Subsidiary has
good title and an absolute (but not necessarily exclusive) right to use the
Trade Secrets, except where the failure to have good title and an absolute right
would not have a Mediconsult Material Adverse Effect. The Trade Secrets have not
been used, divulged, or appropriated either for the benefit of any Person (other
than Mediconsult or any of its Subsidiaries) or to the detriment of Mediconsult
or any of its Subsidiaries. No Trade Secret is subject to any adverse claim or

                  (o) Taxes. Mediconsult and each of its Subsidiaries, and any
consolidated, combined, unitary or aggregate group for Tax purposes of which
Mediconsult or any of its Subsidiaries is or has been a member have properly
completed and timely filed all Tax Returns required to be filed by them and have
paid all Taxes shown thereon to be due, other than any Taxes for which adequate
reserves under GAAP have been recorded in the Mediconsult Financial Statements.
Mediconsult has provided adequate accruals in accordance with GAAP in the
Mediconsult Financial Statements for any Taxes that have not been paid, whether
or not shown as being due on any Tax Returns. Mediconsult has no liability for
unpaid Taxes accruing after the Most Recent Mediconsult Fiscal Period End other
than Taxes arising in the Ordinary Course of Business. There is (i) no claim for
Taxes that is a lien against the property of Mediconsult or any of its
Subsidiaries or is being asserted against Mediconsult or any of its Subsidiaries
other than liens for Taxes not yet due and payable, (ii) Mediconsult has not
been notified that any audit of any Tax Return of Mediconsult or any of its
Subsidiaries is being conducted by a Tax Authority, (iii) no extension of the
statute of limitations on the assessment of any Taxes granted by Mediconsult or
any of its Subsidiaries is currently in effect, and (iv) there is no agreement,
contract or arrangement to which Mediconsult or any of its Subsidiaries is a
party that may result in the payment of any amount that would not be deductible
by reason of Sections 280G, 162 or 404 of the Code. Mediconsult has not been and
will not be required to include any adjustment in Taxable income for any Tax
period (or portion thereof) pursuant to Section 481 or 263A of the Code or any
comparable provision under state or foreign Tax laws as a result of
transactions, events or accounting methods employed prior to the Merger. Neither
Mediconsult nor any of its Subsidiaries has filed or will file any consent to
have the provisions of paragraph 341(f)(2) of the Code (or comparable provisions
of any state Tax laws) apply to Mediconsult or any of its Subsidiaries. Neither
Mediconsult nor any of its Subsidiaries is a party to any Tax sharing or Tax
allocation agreement nor does Mediconsult or any of its Subsidiaries owe any
amount under any such agreement. Neither Mediconsult nor any of its Subsidiaries
has ever been a member of a consolidated, combined or unitary group of which
Mediconsult was not the ultimate parent corporation. Any tax liability of
Mediconsult and its Subsidiaries which, individually or in the aggregate, does
not exceed $10,000 shall not be considered a breach of any representation
contained in this Section 3(o).

                  (p) Employee Benefit Plans.

                           (i)      Schedule 3(p) of the Disclosure Schedule
lists, with respect to Mediconsult, any Subsidiary of Mediconsult and any trade
or business (whether or not incorporated) which is treated as a single employer
with Mediconsult (a "Mediconsult ERISA Affiliate") within the meaning of Section
414(b), (c), (m) or (o) of the Code, (1) all employee benefit plans (as defined
in Section 3(3) of ERISA), (2) each loan to a non-officer employee in excess of
$10,000, loans to officers and directors and any stock option, stock purchase,
phantom

                                      A-30

stock, stock appreciation right, supplemental retirement, severance, sabbatical,
medical, dental, vision care, disability, employee relocation, cafeteria benefit
(Code Section 125) or dependent care (Code Section 129), life insurance or
accident insurance plans, programs or arrangements, (3) all bonus, pension,
profit sharing, savings, deferred compensation or incentive plans, programs or
arrangements, (4) other fringe or employee benefit plans, programs or
arrangements that apply to senior management of Mediconsult and that do not
generally apply to all employees, and (5) any current or former employment or
executive compensation or severance agreements, written or otherwise, that are
still operative and in effect for the benefit of, or relating to, any present or
former employee, consultant or director of Mediconsult (together, the
"Mediconsult Employee Plans").

                           (ii)     Mediconsult has furnished or made available
to Andrx a copy of each of the Mediconsult Employee Plans and related plan
documents (including trust documents, insurance policies or contracts, employee
booklets, summary plan descriptions and other authorizing documents, and any
material employee communications relating thereto) and has, with respect to each
Mediconsult Employee Plan which is subject to ERISA reporting requirements,
provided copies or made available to Andrx the Form 5500 reports filed for the
last three plan years. Any Mediconsult Employee Plan intended to be qualified
under Section 401(a) of the Code has either obtained from the IRS a favorable
determination letter as to its qualified status under the Code, including all
amendments to the Code effected by the Tax Reform Act of 1986 and subsequent
legislation, or will apply to the IRS for such a determination letter prior to
the expiration of the requisite period under applicable Treasury Regulations or
IRS pronouncements in which to apply for such determination letter and to make
any amendments necessary to obtain a favorable determination. Mediconsult has
also furnished or made available to Andrx with the most recent IRS determination
letter issued with respect to each such Mediconsult Employee Plan, and nothing
has occurred since the issuance of each such letter which could reasonably be
expected to cause the loss of the Tax-qualified status of any Mediconsult
Employee Plan subject to Code Section 401(a). Mediconsult has also furnished or
made available to Andrx all registration statements and prospectuses prepared in
connection with each Mediconsult Employee Plan.

                           (iii)    None of the Mediconsult Employee Plans
promises or provides retiree medical or other retiree welfare benefits to any
person except as required by Code Section 4980-B; there has been no "prohibited
transaction," as such term is defined in Section 406 of ERISA and Section 4975
of the Code, with respect to any Mediconsult Employee Plan, which could have, in
the aggregate, a Mediconsult Material Adverse Effect; each Mediconsult Employee
Plan has been administered in accordance with its terms and in compliance with
the requirements prescribed by any and all statutes, rules and regulations
(including ERISA and the Code), except as would not have, in the aggregate, a
Mediconsult Material Adverse Effect, and Mediconsult and each Subsidiary or
Mediconsult ERISA Affiliate have performed all obligations required to be
performed by them under, are not in default under or violation of, and have no
Knowledge of any default or violation by any other party to, any of the
Mediconsult Employee Plans except as would not have, in the aggregate, a
Mediconsult Material Adverse Effect; neither Mediconsult nor any Subsidiary or
ERISA Affiliate is subject to any material liability or penalty under Sections
4976 through 4980 of the Code or Title I of ERISA with respect to any of the
Mediconsult Employee Plans; all contributions or premiums required to be made by
Mediconsult or any Subsidiary or Mediconsult ERISA Affiliate to any Mediconsult
Employee Plan have been

                                      A-31

made on or before their due dates and a reasonable amount has been accrued for
contributions to each Mediconsult Employee Plan for the current plan years; with
respect to each Mediconsult Employee Plan, no "reportable event" within the
meaning of Section 4043 of ERISA (excluding any such event for which the 30 day
notice requirement has been waived under the regulations to Section 4043 of
ERISA) nor any event described in Section 4062, 4063 or 4041 or ERISA has
occurred; all outstanding indebtedness for services performed or accrued
vacation, holiday pay, earned commissions, accrued bonuses or other benefits
owed to any present or former employee, consultant or director have been paid
when due; or to the extent set forth in Section 3(p)(iii) of the Disclosure
Schedule accrued on the books of Mediconsult; and no action or failure to act
with respect to any Mediconsult Employee Plan could subject Andrx or the
Surviving Corporation or any of their respective Affiliates or any Mediconsult
Employee Plan to any material Tax, penalty or other liability, for breach of
fiduciary duty or otherwise, under ERISA or any other applicable law, whether by
way of indemnity or otherwise. With respect to each Mediconsult Employee Plan
subject to ERISA as either an employee pension plan within the meaning of
Section 3(2) of ERISA or an employee welfare benefit plan within the meaning of
Section 3(l) of ERISA, Mediconsult has prepared in good faith and timely filed
all requisite governmental reports (which were true and correct in all material
respects as of the date filed) and has properly and timely filed and distributed
or posted all notices and reports to employees required to be filed, distributed
or posted with respect to each such Mediconsult Employee Plan. No suit,
administrative proceeding, action or other litigation has been brought, or to
the Knowledge of Mediconsult is threatened, against or with respect to any such
Mediconsult Employee Plan, including any audit or inquiry by the IRS or United
States Department of Labor, and, to the Knowledge of Mediconsult, there are no
facts that could give rise to any liability in excess of $10,000, individually
or in the aggregate, in the event of any such suit, proceeding, action or other
litigation. No payment or benefit which will or may be made (either as a result
of the Merger or otherwise) by Mediconsult to any employee will be characterized
as an "excess parachute payment" within the meaning of Section 280G(b)(1) of the
Code. Neither Mediconsult nor any Subsidiary or other ERISA Affiliate is a party
to, or has ever been a party to, or has made any contribution to or otherwise
incurred any obligation under, any "multiemployer plan" as defined in Section
3(37) of ERISA. Neither Mediconsult nor any Subsidiary or Mediconsult ERISA
Affiliate currently maintains, sponsors, participates in or contributes to, nor
has it ever maintained, established, sponsored, participated in, or contributed
to, any pension plan (within the meaning of Section 3(2) of ERISA) which is
subject to Part 3 of Subtitle B of Title I of ERISA, Title IV of ERISA or
Section 412 of the Code.

                           (iv)     With respect to each Mediconsult Employee
Plan, Mediconsult and each of its Subsidiaries have complied with: (1) the
applicable health care continuation and notice provisions of COBRA and the
regulations (including proposed regulations) thereunder, (2) the applicable
requirements of the Family Medical and Leave Act of 1993 and the regulations
thereunder, and (3) the applicable requirements of the Health Insurance
Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 and the regulations (including
proposed regulations) thereunder; except to the extent that such failure to
comply with any of the aforementioned rights, would not, in the aggregate, have
a Mediconsult Material Adverse Effect.

                           (v)      The consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement will not (either alone or when taken together)
(1) entitle any current or former employee or other service provider of
Mediconsult, any Mediconsult Subsidiary or any other

                                      A-32

Mediconsult ERISA Affiliate to severance benefits or any other payment, except
as expressly provided in this Agreement, or (2) accelerate the time of payment
or vesting, or increase the amount of compensation due any such employee or
service provider.

                           (vi)     There has been no amendment to, or written
interpretation or announcement (whether or not written) by Mediconsult, any
Subsidiary or other ERISA Affiliate relating to, or change in participation or
coverage under, any Mediconsult Employee Plan which would materially increase
the expense of maintaining such Plan above the level of expense incurred with
respect to that Plan for the most recent fiscal year included in the Mediconsult
Financial Statements.

                           (vii)    There are no outstanding deferrals of any
cash or securities under the Mediconsult Option Plans.

                  (q) Employee Matters.

                           (i)      Neither the execution and delivery of this
Agreement nor the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby will (1)
result in any payment (including, without limitation, severance, unemployment
compensation, golden parachute, bonus or otherwise) becoming due to any
director, officer or employee of Mediconsult or any of its Subsidiaries, (2)
increase any benefits otherwise payable by Mediconsult or (3) result in the
acceleration of the time of payment or vesting of any such benefits.

                           (ii)     Mediconsult and each of its Subsidiaries are
in compliance with all currently applicable laws and regulations respecting
employment, discrimination in employment, terms and conditions of employment,
wages, hours, occupational safety and health and employment practices, and is
not engaged in any unfair labor practice. Mediconsult and each of its
Subsidiaries has withheld all amounts required by law or by agreement to be
withheld from the wages, salaries, and other payments to employees, and is not
liable for any arrears of wages or any material Taxes or any penalty for failure
to comply with any of the foregoing that would have a Mediconsult Material
Adverse Effect. Mediconsult is not liable for any payment to any trust or other
fund or to any Governmental Entity with respect to unemployment compensation
benefits, social security or other benefits or obligations for employees (other
than routine payments to be made in the normal course of business and consistent
with past practice). There are no pending claims against Mediconsult or any of
its Subsidiaries under any workers compensation plan or policy or for long term
disability. Neither Mediconsult nor any of its Subsidiaries has any obligations
under COBRA with respect to any former employees or qualified beneficiaries
thereunder, except for obligations that would not, individually or in the
aggregate, have a Mediconsult Material Adverse Effect. There are no
controversies pending or, to the Knowledge of Mediconsult, threatened between
Mediconsult or any of its Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and any of their
respective employees, on the other hand, which controversies have or would
result in an action, suit, proceeding, claim, arbitration or investigation
before any Governmental Entity which would have a Mediconsult Material Adverse
Effect. Neither Mediconsult nor any of its Subsidiaries is a party to any
collective bargaining agreement or other labor union contract; nor does
Mediconsult have Knowledge of any activities or proceedings of any labor union
to organize any employees of Mediconsult or any of its Subsidiaries. To
Mediconsult's Knowledge, no employees of Mediconsult are in violation of any
term of any

                                      A-33

employment contract, patent disclosure agreement, noncompetition agreement, or
any restrictive covenant to a former employer relating to the right of any such
employee to be employed by Mediconsult because of the nature of the business
conducted or presently proposed to be conducted by Mediconsult or to the use of
trade secrets or proprietary information of others. Except as disclosed in the
Mediconsult Public Reports filed prior to the date of this Agreement,
Mediconsult does not have any employment agreement with any of its officers or
other employees.

                  (r) Interested Party Transactions. Except as disclosed in the
Mediconsult Public Reports filed prior to the date of this Agreement, neither
Mediconsult nor any of its Subsidiaries is indebted to any director, officer,
employee or agent of Mediconsult or any of its Subsidiaries (except for amounts
due as normal salaries and bonuses and in reimbursement of ordinary expenses),
and no such person is indebted to Mediconsult or any of its Subsidiaries other
than any employees (who is not an officer) for nonmaterial amounts, and there
have been no other transactions of the type required to be disclosed pursuant to
Items 402 and 404 of Regulation S-K under the Securities Act and the Securities
Exchange Act.

                  (s) Insurance. Mediconsult and each of its Subsidiaries have
policies of insurance and bonds of the type and in amounts customarily carried
by persons conducting businesses or owning assets similar to those of
Mediconsult and its Subsidiaries. There is no material claim pending under any
of such policies or bonds as to which coverage has been questioned, denied or
disputed by the underwriters of such policies or bonds. All premiums due and
payable under all such policies and bonds have been paid and Mediconsult and its
Subsidiaries are otherwise in compliance in all material respects with the terms
of such policies and bonds. Mediconsult has no Knowledge of any threatened
termination of, or material premium increase with respect to, any of such
policies.

                  (t) Regulatory Matters.

                           (i)      Mediconsult and its Subsidiaries have
complied, and are in compliance, in all respects with all applicable federal,
state, local and self-regulatory laws, statutes, licensing requirements, rules,
and regulations, except where such noncompliance would not have a Mediconsult
Material Adverse Effect. Each of Mediconsult and its Subsidiaries has obtained
and is in compliance in all respects with, all Governmental Permits of any and
all Governmental Entities required for the carrying on of its business and the
maintenance of its assets and such Governmental Permits are in full force and
effect, and there are no circumstances of which Mediconsult is aware which
indicate that any of such Governmental Permits may be revoked or not renewed or
withdrawn or (except to an immaterial or beneficial extent) amended, in whole or
in part, except where such noncompliance would not have a Mediconsult Material
Adverse Effect. Schedule 3(t) to the Disclosure Schedule sets forth a true and
complete list of all Governmental Permits held by or on behalf of Mediconsult or
any of its Subsidiaries. Neither Mediconsult nor any of its Subsidiaries has
received any written or, to the Knowledge of Mediconsult, oral notice from any
Governmental Entity (1) asserting that Mediconsult or any of its Subsidiaries is
not in compliance in any respect with any of the statutes, regulations, or
ordinances that such Governmental Entity enforces or (2) threatening to revoke
cancel or not renew any Governmental Permit or (3) restricting or disqualifying
their activities. After giving effect to the Merger, all Governmental Permits of
the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries

                                      A-34

shall continue to be valid and in full force and effect to the same extent as
they presently are for Mediconsult and its Subsidiaries. There is no order
issued, investigation or proceeding pending or, to Mediconsult's Knowledge,
threatened, or notice served which remains outstanding or unresolved, with
respect to any violation of any law, statute, ordinance, order, writ, decree,
rule, or regulation issued by any Governmental Entity applicable to either
Mediconsult or any of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective directors,
officers, employees or agents.

                           (ii)     Neither Mediconsult nor any of its
Subsidiaries is a party or subject to any agreement, consent decree or order, or
other understanding or arrangement with, or any directive of any Governmental
Entity which imposes any material restrictions on, or otherwise affects in any
material respect, the conduct of the business of Mediconsult or any of its
Subsidiaries. Schedule 3(t) of the Disclosure Schedule sets forth all compliance
or enforcement proceedings or, to the Knowledge of Mediconsult, examinations,
inspections, investigations or inquiries convened, and all fines, sanctions and
other measures imposed by any Governmental Entity against, concerning or
relating to Mediconsult, any of its Subsidiaries, any of their respective
predecessor entities, or any of their respective directors, officers, employees
or agents.

                  (u) Material Contracts.

                           (i)      Except for the contracts included as

penalty, and involves the receipt or payment by Mediconsult or any of its
Subsidiaries of more than $10,000 during any twelve month period;

Exchange Act) or to compete with any Person except for competition in any lines
of business in which neither Party is currently engaged or will foreseeably
engage or any confidentiality, secrecy or non-disclosure contract or agreement

                                      A-36

                                    (17) any agreement which would be terminable
other than by Mediconsult or its Subsidiaries or any agreement that provides for
the payment of money, accelerates or increases benefits, vesting or compensation
or entitles any person to take actions or receive benefits or otherwise triggers
obligations as a result of the Merger or consummation of any of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement not otherwise disclosed in the Disclosure
Schedule; or

                                    (18) any other agreement which is material

or which may have a material affect on Mediconsult's assets or, properties or

                           (ii)     Each of Mediconsult and its Subsidiaries has
performed all of the obligations required to be performed by it and is entitled
to all accrued benefits under, and is not in default, nor to Mediconsult's
Knowledge, has a claim been made that it is in default in respect of, each
Mediconsult Material Contract to which it is a party or by which it is bound,
except where the nonperformance would not have a Mediconsult Material Adverse
Effect. Each of the Mediconsult Material Contracts is in full force and effect
and there exists no default or event of default or event, occurrence, condition
or act, with respect to Mediconsult or its Subsidiaries or, to Mediconsult's
Knowledge, with respect to any other contracting party, which, with the giving
of notice, the lapse of time or the happening of any other event or condition,
would become a material default or event of default under any Mediconsult
Material Contract, except where the failure to give such notice would not have a
Mediconsult Material Adverse Effect. There are no unwritten obligations or
agreements or course of dealings contrary in any material respect to the
specific terms and conditions of any Mediconsult Material Contract. True,
correct and complete copies of all Mediconsult Material Contracts have been
delivered or made available to Andrx or filed as an exhibit to the Mediconsult

options; restricted stock, stock appreciation rights or other rights to acquire
securities under the Mediconsult Option Plans to Mediconsult Employees and
consultants of Mediconsult and its Subsidiaries other than in the Ordinary
Course of Business. Except to the extent provided for under the terms of
agreements in effect as of the date hereof, Mediconsult has not accelerated,
amended or changed the period of exercisability or vesting of options,
restricted stock or other rights granted, under the Mediconsult Option Plans, or
authorized cash payments in exchange for any options, restricted stock or other
rights granted under any of the Mediconsult Option Plans.

                  (w) Opinion of Financial Advisor. Mediconsult has been advised
by its financial advisor, McFarland Dewey, that in such advisor's opinion, as of
the date hereof, the Merger is fair, from a financial point of view, to the
stockholders of Mediconsult. A copy of the written opinion to the foregoing
effect of McFarland Dewey dated as of the date of this Agreement has been
delivered to Andrx or will be delivered to Andrx within five business days from
the date of this Agreement.

                  (x) Tax and Accounting Treatment. Mediconsult has not taken
any action that would interfere with Andrx's or the Surviving Corporation's
ability to account for the Merger as

                                      A-37

a purchase or would prevent the Merger from constituting a transaction
qualifying as a reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code.
Neither Mediconsult nor any of its Affiliates or agents is aware of any
agreement, plan or other circumstance that is not contemplated by this Agreement
that would interfere with Andrx's ability to account for the Merger as a
purchase or prevent the Merger from qualifying as a reorganization within the
meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code.

                  (y) Representations Complete. None of the representations or
warranties made by Mediconsult herein or in any schedule hereto, including the
Disclosure Schedule, or certificate furnished by Mediconsult pursuant to this
Agreement, or the Mediconsult Public Reports, when all such documents are read
together in their entirety, contains or will contain at the Effective Time any
untrue statement of a material fact, or omits or will omit at the Effective Time
to state any material fact necessary in order to make the statements contained
herein or therein, in the light of the circumstances under which made, not
misleading.

                  (a) Organization of Andrx. Andrx is a corporation duly
organized and validly existing under the laws of Delaware. Andrx is duly
authorized to conduct business and is in good standing under the laws of each
jurisdiction where such qualification is required, except where the lack of such
qualification would not have a material adverse effect on the business,
operations, results of operations, assets, liabilities or financial condition of
Andrx, taken as a whole, or on the ability of the Parties to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement (an "Andrx Material Adverse
Effect"). Andrx has full corporate power and authority to carry on the
businesses in which it is engaged and to own and use the properties owned and
used by it. Andrx has delivered or made available to Mediconsult a true and
correct copy of the Andrx Certificate of Incorporation and the bylaws of Andrx,

Certificate of Incorporation or its bylaws, each as amended.

of Andrx Common Stock are issued and outstanding, 50,000,000 shares of Cybear
Tracking Stock, of which 15,207,324 shares of Cybear Tracking Stock are issued

                                      A-38

issued, fully paid, and nonassessable and are free and clear of any liens or
encumbrances other than any liens or encumbrances created by or imposed upon the
holders thereof, and are not subject to preemptive rights or rights of first
refusal created by statute, the Andrx Certificate of Incorporation or the bylaws
of Andrx, each as amended, or any agreement to which Andrx is a party or by
which it is bound. The shares of Cybear Tracking Stock to be issued in the
Merger will be, when issued, duly and validly issued, fully paid and
nonassessable, and not subject to any restriction on transfer imposed by the
Andrx Certificate of Incorporation or bylaws of Andrx. There are no outstanding
or authorized options, warrants, stock appreciation rights, calls, purchase
rights, subscription rights, conversion rights, exchange rights, or other
contracts or commitments that could require Andrx to issue, deliver, sell,
repurchase or redeem, or cause to be issued, delivered, sold, repurchased or
redeemed, any shares of Andrx Capital Stock or obligating Andrx to grant or
otherwise enter into any such option, warrant, call, stock appreciation,
purchase, subscription, conversion, exchange or other right, contract,
commitment or agreement, or otherwise cause to become outstanding any of its
capital stock. There are no contracts, commitments or agreements relating to the
voting, purchase or sale of Andrx Capital Stock (i) between or among Andrx and
any of its stockholders, or (ii) to Andrx's Knowledge, between or among any of
Andrx's stockholders.

                  (c) Authorization of Transaction. Andrx has full power and
authority (including full corporate power and authority) to execute and deliver
this Agreement and to perform its obligations hereunder. This Agreement
constitutes the valid and legally binding obligation of Andrx, enforceable in
accordance with its terms and conditions except as such enforcement may be
limited by (i) the effect of bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization,
receivership, conservatorship, arrangement, moratorium or other laws affecting
or relating to the rights of creditors generally, or (ii) the rules governing
the availability of specific performance, injunctive relief or other equitable
remedies and general principles of equity, regardless of whether considered in a
proceeding in equity or at law.

                  (d) Noncontravention. Neither the execution and the delivery
of this Agreement, nor the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby,
will (i) subject to the Required Filings, violate any constitution, statute,
regulation, rule, injunction, judgment, order, decree, ruling, charge, or other
restriction of any government, or Governmental Entity which Andrx is subject,
(ii) violate any provision of the charter or bylaws of Andrx, or (iii) conflict
with, result in a breach of, constitute a default under, result in the
acceleration of, create in any party the right to accelerate, terminate, modify,
or cancel, or require any notice under any agreement, contract, lease, license,
instrument or other arrangement to which Andrx is a party or by which it is
bound or to which any of its assets is subject, except, in the cases of (i) and
(iii), where the violation, conflict, breach, default, acceleration,
termination, modification, cancellation, or failure to give notice would not
have an Andrx Material Adverse Effect. Other than the Required Filings, Andrx is
not required to give any notice to, make any filing with, or obtain any
authorization, consent, or approval of any government or Governmental Entity in
order for the Parties to consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. Andrx is not aware of any reason why the approvals of any
Governmental Entities necessary to permit consummation of the Merger or the
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement will not be received without
the imposition of a condition or requirement that would have an Andrx Material
Adverse Effect.

                                      A-39

                  (e) Filings with the SEC. Since January 1, 1999, each of Andrx
and Cybear has made all filings with the SEC that it has been required to make
under the Securities Act and the Securities Exchange Act (collectively, the
"Andrx Public Reports"). Each of the Andrx Public Reports has complied in all
material respects with the Securities Act and the Securities Exchange Act in
effect as of their respective dates. None of the Andrx Public Reports, as of
their respective dates (or if amended or superseded by a filing prior to the
date of this Agreement, then on the date of such filing) contained any untrue
statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact necessary in
order to make the statements made therein, in light of the circumstances under
which they were made, not misleading except to the extent corrected by a
subsequently filed Andrx Public Report. Andrx has delivered or made available to
Mediconsult a correct and complete copy of each Andrx Public Report (together
with all exhibits and schedules thereto and as amended to date) and will
promptly make available to Mediconsult all Andrx Public Reports and the exhibits
thereto filed after the date hereof and prior to the Effective Time. Except as
would not have an Andrx Material Adverse Effect, all documents required to be
filed as exhibits to the Andrx Public Reports have been so filed, and all
material contracts so filed as exhibits are in full force and effect, except
those which have expired in accordance with their terms, and Andrx is not in
material default thereunder.

                  (f) Financial Statements. The financial statements included in
Andrx Public Reports were complete and correct in all material respects as of
their respective dates, comply in all material respects with the Securities
Exchange Act and the rules and regulations of the SEC promulgated thereunder and
have been prepared in accordance with GAAP applied on a consistent basis
throughout the periods covered thereby (except as may be indicated in the notes
thereto or, in the case of unaudited financial statements, as may be permitted
by the SEC on Form 10-Q under the Securities Exchange Act), present fairly the
financial condition of Andrx and its Subsidiaries as of the indicated dates and
the results of operations of Andrx and its Subsidiaries for the indicated
periods, are correct and complete in all material respects as of their
respective dates, and are consistent with the books and records of Andrx and its
Subsidiaries, except that the unaudited interim financial statements were or are
subject to normal and recurring year-end adjustments which were not, or are not
expected to be, material in amount.

                  (g) Events Subsequent to Most Recent Andrx Fiscal Period End.
Since September 30, 2000 (the "Most Recent Andrx Fiscal Period End"), there has
not been (i) any change which would have an Andrx Material Adverse Effect, (ii)
any acquisition, sale or transfer of any material assets of Andrx, (iii) any
change in accounting methods or practices (including any change in depreciation
or amortization policies or rates) by Andrx, except as required by concurrent
changes in GAAP, or any revaluation by Andrx of any of its assets, except where
such change will not have an Andrx Material Adverse Effect, (iv) any direct or
indirect redemption, purchase or other acquisition by Andrx of any of the shares
of Andrx Capital Stock, (v) any material contract entered into, other than in
the Ordinary Course of Business, which relates to Cybear, or any material

which relates to Cybear or by which entities relating to Cybear are bound, (vi)
any amendment or change to the Andrx Certificate of Incorporation or bylaws of
Andrx, (vii) any material change in the interest rate risk management and
hedging policies, procedures or practices of Andrx or any of its Subsidiaries,
or any material failure to comply with such policies, procedures or practices;
or (viii) any negotiation or agreement by Andrx or any of its Subsidiaries to do
any of the things described in the preceding clauses (i) through (vii).

                                      A-40

                  (h) Undisclosed Liabilities. Andrx does not have any
obligations or liabilities (contingent or otherwise) except obligations and
liabilities (i) that are fully accrued or provided for in all material respects
in the consolidated balance sheet of Andrx as of the Most Recent Andrx Fiscal
Period End in accordance with GAAP, or disclosed in the notes therein in
accordance with GAAP or (ii) that were incurred after the Most Recent Andrx
Fiscal Period End in the Ordinary Course of Business (none of which results
from, arises out of, relates to, is in the nature of, or was caused by any
breach of contract, breach of warranty, tort, infringement, or violation of
law). All material agreements currently in effect, including all agreements,
arrangements or understandings with directors and officers of Andrx, are filed
as exhibits to the Andrx Public Reports.

                  (i) Brokers' Fees. Andrx does not have any liability or
obligation to pay any fees or commissions to any broker, finder, or agent with
respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement for which any of
Andrx and its Subsidiaries could become liable or obligated except for fees to
be paid to CIBC World Markets Corp.

                  (j) Disclosure. The Registration Statement and the Proxy
Statement/Prospectus will comply with the Securities Act and the Securities
Exchange Act in all material respects. At the time it becomes effective under
the Securities Act the Registration Statement and at the time it is mailed to
the Mediconsult Stockholders and at the time of the Mediconsult Stockholders
Meeting the Proxy Statement/Prospectus will not contain any untrue statement of
a material fact or omit to state a material fact necessary in order to make the
statements made therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they will
be made, not misleading, provided, however, that Andrx makes no representation
or warranty with respect to any information that Mediconsult will supply
specifically for use in the Registration Statement and the Proxy
Statement/Prospectus. None of the information that Andrx will supply
specifically for use in the Registration Statement or the Proxy
Statement/Prospectus will contain any untrue statement of a material fact or
omit to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements made
therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they will be made, not
misleading.

                  (k) Litigation. Andrx is not (i) subject to any outstanding
injunction, judgment, order, decree, ruling, or charge or (ii) a party to or, to
Andrx's Knowledge, threatened to be made a party to, any action, suit,
proceeding, hearing, or investigation of, in, or before any Governmental Entity
or before any arbitrator which would have an Andrx Material Adverse Effect.

                  (l) Compliance With Laws. Each of Andrx and its Subsidiaries
has complied in all respects with all applicable federal, state, local,
self-regulatory and foreign laws, statutes, ordinances, rules and regulations,
and is not in violation in any respect of, and has not received any notices of
violation with respect to, its respective certificate or articles of
incorporation or bylaws or other charter or organizational documents, each as
amended, or any federal, state, local, self-regulatory or foreign statute, law,
ordinance, rule or regulation applicable to the conduct of its business or the
ownership or operation of its business, except where such noncompliance or
violation by Andrx would not have an Andrx Material Adverse Effect.

                  (m) Tax and Accounting Treatment. Neither Andrx nor any of its
directors or officers has taken any action that would interfere with Andrx's or
the Surviving Corporation's

                                      A-41

ability to account for the Merger as a purchase or would prevent the Merger from
constituting a transaction qualifying as a reorganization within the meaning of
Section 368(a) of the Code. Neither Andrx nor any of its Affiliates or agents is
aware of any agreement, plan or other circumstance that would interfere with
Andrx's ability to account for the Merger as a purchase or prevent the Merger

                           (viii)   except as set forth on Schedule 6(d) of the

                           (ix)     except as set forth on Schedule 6(d) of the

will commit to any of the foregoing.

                  (e) Full Access.

                           (i)      Mediconsult will (and will cause each of its
Subsidiaries to) permit representatives of Andrx to have reasonable full access
during normal business hours, upon reasonable notice, to all premises,
properties, personnel, books, records (including Tax records), contracts, and
documents of or pertaining to each of Mediconsult and its Subsidiaries during
the period prior to the Effective Time; provided that Andrx and its
representatives will conduct any such review in a manner that does not interfere
with the normal business operations of Mediconsult. Andrx will (and will cause
each of its employees, agents or other representatives to) treat and hold as
such any Confidential Information it receives from any of Mediconsult and its
Subsidiaries in the course of the reviews contemplated by this Section 6(e)(i),
will not use any of the Confidential Information except in connection with this
Agreement, and, if this Agreement is terminated for any reason whatsoever,
agrees to return to Mediconsult all tangible embodiments (and all copies)
thereof which are in its possession. The provisions of this Section 6(e)(i)
relating to the Confidential Information will survive any termination of this
Agreement. No information or knowledge obtained by Andrx (or any of its
employees, agents or other representatives) in any investigation pursuant to
this Section 6(e)(i) will affect or be deemed to modify any representation or
warranty contained herein or the conditions to the obligations of the Parties to
consummate the Merger.

                                      A-46

                           (ii)     Andrx will (and will cause each of its
Subsidiaries to) permit representatives of Mediconsult to have reasonable full
access during normal business hours, upon reasonable notice, to all premises,
properties, personnel, books, records (including Tax records), contracts, and
documents of or pertaining to each of Andrx and its Subsidiaries during the
period prior to the Effective Time; provided that Mediconsult and its
representatives will conduct any such review in a manner that does not interfere
with the normal business operations of Andrx. Mediconsult will (and will cause
each of its employees, agents or other representatives to) treat and hold as
such any Confidential Information it receives from any of Andrx and its
Subsidiaries in the course of the reviews contemplated by this Section 6(e)(ii),
will not use any of the Confidential Information except in connection with this
Agreement, and, if this Agreement is terminated for any reason whatsoever,
agrees to return to Andrx all tangible embodiments (and all copies) thereof
which are in its possession. The provisions of this Section 6(e)(ii) relating to
the Confidential Information will survive any termination of this Agreement. No
information or knowledge obtained by Mediconsult (or any of its employees,
agents or other representatives) in any investigation pursuant to this Section
6(e)(ii) will affect or be deemed to modify any representation or warranty
contained herein or the conditions to the obligations of the Parties to
consummate the Merger.

                  (f) Notice of Developments. Each Party will give prompt
written notice to the other of any material adverse development causing a breach
of any of its own representations and warranties in Section 3, Section 4 or
Section 5 above. No disclosure by any Party pursuant to this Section 6(f),
however, shall be deemed to amend or supplement the Disclosure Schedule or to
prevent or cure any misrepresentation, breach of warranty, or breach of
covenant.

                  (g) Insurance and Indemnification.

                           (i)      For a period of four years after the
Effective Time, Andrx shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless to the fullest
extent permitted under applicable law each person who is now or has been an
officer, director, employee, trustee or agent of Mediconsult (or any
Subsidiary), including, without limitation, each person controlling any of the
foregoing persons (individually, an "Indemnified Party" and collectively, the
"Indemnified Parties,") against all losses, claims, damages, liabilities, costs
or expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees), judgments, fines, penalties
and amounts paid in settlement in connection with any claim, action, suit,
proceeding or investigation, whether civil, criminal, or administrative, arising
out of or pertaining to acts or omissions, or alleged acts or omissions, by them
in their capacities as such, whether commenced, asserted or claimed before or
after the Effective Time; provided, however, that Andrx shall not be obligated
to indemnify, defend or hold harmless any Indemnified Party in excess of the
amount that Mediconsult currently provides its officers, directors, employees,
trustees or agents. In the event of any such claim, action, suit, proceeding or
investigation (an "Action"): (A) Andrx shall pay the reasonable fees and
expenses of counsel selected by the Indemnified Party, which counsel shall be
reasonably acceptable to Andrx, in advance of the final disposition of any such
Action to the full extent and under all circumstances permitted by applicable
law as in effect on the date hereof, upon receipt of any undertaking required by
applicable law, and (B) Andrx will cooperate in the defense of any such matter;
provided, however, that Andrx shall not be liable for any settlement effected
without its written consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld)
and provided, further, that Andrx shall not be obligated pursuant to this
Section 6(g) to pay the fees and disbursements of more

                                      A-47

than one counsel for all Indemnified Parties in any single Action, except to the
extent that, in the opinion of counsel for the Indemnified Parties, two or more
of such Indemnified Parties have conflicting interests in the outcome of such
action. Andrx may obtain directors' and officers' liability insurance covering
its obligations under this Section. In the event any Indemnified Party is
required to bring any action to enforce rights or to collect moneys due under
this Agreement and is successful in such action, Andrx shall reimburse such
Indemnified Party for all of its expenses in bringing and pursuing such action.

                           (ii)     The certificate of incorporation and bylaws
of the Surviving Corporation will contain provisions with respect to exculpation
and indemnification that are at least as favorable to the Indemnified Parties as
those contained in the Mediconsult Certificate of Incorporation and the bylaws
of Mediconsult as in effect on the date hereof, which provisions will not be
amended, repealed or otherwise modified for a period of four years from the
Effective Time in any manner that would adversely affect the rights thereunder
of any Indemnified Party or of individuals who, immediately prior to the
Effective Time were employees or agents of Mediconsult, unless such modification
is required by law.

                           (iii)    For a period of four years after the
Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall, and Andrx shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to maintain in effect any existing policies of directors'
and officers' liability insurance; provided that Andrx may substitute therefore
policies with coverage containing terms and conditions at least as favorable as
Mediconsult's existing policies with respect to claims arising from facts or
events that occurred prior to the Effective Time, so long as such substitution
shall not result in any gaps or lapses in coverage with respect to matters
occurring prior to the Effective Time.

                           (iv)     The provisions of this Section 6(g) shall
survive the Effective Time and are (x) intended to be for the benefit of, and
will be enforceable by, each of the Indemnified Parties and their heirs and
representatives and (y) in addition to, and not in substitution for, any other
rights to indemnification or contribution that any such Indemnified Party may
have by contract or otherwise.

                           (v)      In the event Mediconsult or the Surviving
Corporation or any of their respective successors or assigns (x) consolidates
with or merges into any other person and shall not be the continuing or
surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger or (y) transfers
a material amount of its properties and assets to any person in a single
transaction or a series of transactions, then, and in each case, Andrx will make
or cause to be made proper provision so that the successors and assigns of
Mediconsult or the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, assume the
indemnification obligations described herein for the benefit of the Indemnified
Parties.

                           (vi)     The provision of this Section 6(g) shall
survive the Effective Time and are (x) intended to be for the benefit of, and
will be enforceable by, each of the Indemnified Parties and their heirs and
representatives and (y) in addition to, and not in substitution for, any other
rights to indemnification or contribution that any such Indemnified party may
have by contract or otherwise.

                                      A-48

                  (h) Mediconsult Options and Warrants.

                           (i)      At the Effective Time, Andrx shall assume
all outstanding Mediconsult Options, whether or not vested, under the
Mediconsult Option Plans (and shall assume the Mediconsult Option Plans and,
prior to the Effective Time all outstanding Mediconsult Warrants, whether or not
then exercisable): (i) Mediconsult represents and warrants to Andrx that
Schedule 6(h) of the Disclosure Schedule sets forth a true and complete list as
of the date hereof of (1) all holders of outstanding options under the
Mediconsult Stock Option Plan, including the number of shares of Mediconsult
Capital Stock subject to each such option, the exercise or vesting schedule, the
exercise price per share and the term of each such option, and (2) all holders
of the Mediconsult Warrants, including the number of shares of Mediconsult
Capital Stock subject to each Mediconsult Warrant, the exercise or vesting
schedule, the exercise price per share and the term of the Mediconsult Warrants.
On the Closing Date, Mediconsult shall deliver to Andrx an updated Schedule 3(b)
current as of such date. Each such option so assumed by Andrx under this
Agreement shall continue to have, and be subject to, the same terms and
conditions set forth in the Mediconsult Option Plans and the applicable stock
option agreements in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, and each
such Mediconsult Warrant so assumed by Andrx under this Agreement shall, after
the Effective Time, continue to have, and be subject to, the same terms and
conditions set forth in the applicable warrant agreements immediately prior to
the Effective Time (including, without limitation, any repurchase rights or
vesting provisions and provisions regarding the acceleration of vesting and
exercisability on certain transactions), except that (1) each such option or
warrant will be exercisable (or will become exercisable in accordance with its
terms) for that number of whole shares of Cybear Tracking Stock equal to the
product of the number of shares of Mediconsult Common Stock that were issuable
upon exercise of such option or warrant (assuming full vesting) immediately
prior to the Effective Time multiplied by the Exchange Ratio and rounded down to
the nearest whole number of shares of Cybear Tracking Stock, and (2) the per
share exercise price for the shares of Cybear Tracking Stock issuable upon
exercise of such assumed option or warrant will be equal to the quotient
determined by dividing the exercise price per share of Mediconsult Common Stock
at which such option or warrant was exercisable immediately prior to the
Effective Time by the Exchange Ratio, rounded up to the nearest whole cent,
subject to any adjustments necessary to protect the status of any option as an
incentive stock option as defined in Section 422(b) of the Code. It is the
intention of the Parties that any options so assumed by Andrx, which qualify as
incentive stock options prior to the Effective Time, also qualify as incentive
stock options, to the maximum extent permissible, following the Effective Time.
Within 30 business days after the Effective Time, Andrx shall issue to each
Person who, immediately prior to the Effective Time was a holder of an
outstanding option under the Mediconsult Option Plans, a document evidencing the
foregoing assumption of such option by Andrx. Within 30 days prior to the
Effective Time, Andrx shall issue to each Person who, immediately prior to the
Effective Time was a holder of an outstanding Mediconsult Warrant, a document
evidencing the foregoing assumption of such warrants by Andrx. At the Effective
Time, (x) all references in the related stock option agreements and warrant
agreements to Mediconsult shall be deemed to refer to Andrx and (y) Andrx shall
assume all of Mediconsult's obligations with respect to Mediconsult's options as
so amended.

                           (ii)     Prior to the Effective Time, Andrx shall
take such action, including, without limitation, obtaining all necessary
individual consents, as shall ensure that the

                                      A-49

Mediconsult Options may be assumed by Andrx and will not have their vesting
accelerated as a result of the consummation of the Merger and the transactions
contemplated hereby.

                  (i) Certain Tax Matters.

                           (i)      Return Filing; Information Sharing Until the
Closing Date:

                                    (1) Mediconsult shall prepare and file, or
cause to be prepared and filed, with the appropriate Governmental Entity all
federal Tax Returns and all material state, local and foreign Tax Returns
required to be filed (with extensions) by or with respect to Mediconsult and its
Subsidiaries, on or prior to the Closing Date; provided, however, Mediconsult
shall not file any Tax Returns until Andrx has had an opportunity to review such
Tax Return and approves such Tax Return.

                                    (2) Mediconsult agrees that it will, and
will cause its Affiliates to, make available all such information, employees and
records of or relating to Mediconsult and its Subsidiaries, as Andrx may request
with respect to matters relating to Taxes (including, without limitation, the
right to make copies of such information and records) and will cooperate with
respect to all matters relating to Taxes (including, without limitation, the
filing of Tax Returns, the filing of amended Tax Returns, audits, and
proceedings); and

                                    (3) If any of Mediconsult or any of its
Subsidiaries or any of their respective Affiliates receives any written notice
from any Tax Authority proposing any audit or adjustment to any Tax relating to
Mediconsult or any Subsidiary or any of their respective Affiliates, Mediconsult
shall give prompt written notice thereof to Andrx, which notice shall describe
in detail each proposed adjustment.

                                    (4) Andrx and Mediconsult shall cooperate in
causing the Merger to qualify as a Tax-free reorganization under Code Section
368(a) and shall treat the Merger as such a reorganization in which no other
property or money (within the meaning of Code Section 356) is received by
Mediconsult stockholders for all Tax purposes, including the reporting of the
Merger as qualifying as such a reorganization on all relevant federal, state,
local and foreign Tax Returns. Andrx and Mediconsult covenant and agree to (and
to cause any Affiliate or successor to their assets or business to) vigorously
and in good faith defend all challenges to the Tax-free status of the Merger.

                           (ii)     Tax Covenants.

                                    (1) Andrx and Merger Sub covenant and agree
not (i) to take any action (or cause the Surviving Corporation to take any
action), and (ii) to fail to take any action (or cause the Surviving Corporation
or any Subsidiaries or Affiliates of Andrx or Merger Sub, respectively, to fail
to take any action) which if taken or not taken, as the case may be, would
reasonably be expected to prevent the Merger from qualifying as a reorganization
within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code.

                                    (2) Mediconsult covenants and agrees not (i)
to take any action and (ii) fail to take any action (or cause any Subsidiaries
or Affiliates of Mediconsult to fail to take any action) other than any action
specifically contemplated by this Agreement which if taken or

                                      A-50

not taken, as the case may be, would reasonably be expected to prevent the
Merger from qualifying as a reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a)
of the Code.

         Each of Andrx and Mediconsult shall execute the officer's certificates
substantially in the form attached as Exhibits A and B hereto, as of the date
the Registration Statement is declared effective by the SEC and as of the
Closing Date; provided, however, that the failure of Andrx, Merger Sub or
Mediconsult to certify as to any matter in such certificates because of an
event, or change in facts or law, in any case outside of such party's control,
shall not constitute a breach of this covenant.

                  (j) No Solicitation. From and after the date of this Agreement
until the Effective Time or earlier termination of this Agreement pursuant to
Section 8, Mediconsult and its Subsidiaries and the officers, directors,
employees, agents, representatives and advisors of Mediconsult and its
Subsidiaries (collectively, the "Representatives") will not, directly or
indirectly, (i) take any action to solicit, initiate, encourage (including by
way of furnishing information) or take any other action designed to facilitate
or agree to any Takeover Proposal or (ii) subject to the next three sentences,
engage in negotiations with, or disclose any nonpublic information relating to
Mediconsult or its Subsidiaries to, or afford access to the properties, books or
records of Mediconsult or any of its Subsidiaries to, any person that has
advised Mediconsult that it may be considering making, or that has made, a
Takeover Proposal; provided, nothing herein shall prohibit Mediconsult's Board
of Directors from taking and disclosing to its stockholders a position with
respect to an unsolicited tender offer pursuant to Rules 14d-9 and 14e-2
promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act. Notwithstanding the immediately
preceding sentence, if an unsolicited Takeover Proposal shall be received by the
Board of Directors of Mediconsult, then, to the extent the Board of Directors of
Mediconsult believes in good faith (after receiving advice from a reputable
financial advisor reasonably acceptable to Andrx) that such Takeover Proposal is
reasonably capable of being consummated and would, if consummated, be reasonably
likely to result in a transaction more favorable to the Mediconsult Stockholders
than the transaction contemplated by this Agreement (any such more favorable
Takeover Proposal being referred to in this Agreement as a "Superior Proposal")
and the Board of Directors of Mediconsult determines in good faith that it could
reasonably be deemed necessary for the Board of Directors of Mediconsult to
further entertain and consider the Superior Proposal in order to comply with its
fiduciary duties to stockholders under applicable law, Mediconsult and its
Representatives may furnish information and afford access to the properties,
books or records of Mediconsult or any of its Subsidiaries to the party making
such Superior Proposal and engage in negotiations with such party, and such
actions shall not be considered a breach of this Section 6(j) or any other
provisions of this Agreement; provided that in any event Mediconsult shall
notify Andrx of the receipt of a Takeover Proposal and shall notify Andrx of any
determination by Mediconsult's Board of Directors and Mediconsult shall deliver
to Andrx a true and complete copy of the Takeover Proposal (or summary of any
oral proposal) received from such third party and all documents containing or
referring to non-public information of Mediconsult that are supplied to such
third party. Further, Mediconsult shall provide such non-public information
pursuant to a nondisclosure agreement containing customary limitations on the
use and disclosure of all written and oral information furnished to such third
party by or on behalf of Mediconsult (which will not contain "standstill" or
similar provisions). In addition, Mediconsult shall not agree to endorse, and
shall not permit any of its officers, directors, employees or other
representatives to agree to or endorse, any Takeover

                                      A-51

Proposal or withdraw its recommendation of this Agreement and the Merger unless
the Board of Directors of Mediconsult believes in good faith (after receiving
advice from a reputable financial advisor reasonably acceptable to Andrx) that
such action is required in order for the Board of Directors to comply with its
fiduciary duties to stockholders under applicable law, and Mediconsult has
terminated this Agreement pursuant to Section 8(a). Mediconsult will promptly
(and in any event within 24 hours) notify Andrx after receipt of any Takeover
Proposal or any notice that any person is considering making a Takeover Proposal
or any request for non-public information relating to Mediconsult or any of its
Subsidiaries or for access to the properties, books or records of Mediconsult or
any of its Subsidiaries by any person that has advised Mediconsult that it may
be considering making, or that has made, a Takeover Proposal (such notice to
include the identity of such person or persons), and will keep Andrx fully
informed of the status and details of any such Takeover Proposal notice, request
or any correspondence or communications related thereto and shall provide Andrx
with a true and complete copy of such Takeover Proposal notice or request or
correspondence or communications related thereto, if it is in writing, or a
complete written summary thereof, if it is not in writing. Mediconsult shall
immediately cease and cause to be terminated any discussion or negotiations with
any persons that may have existed with respect to a Takeover Proposal prior to
the execution of this Agreement.

                  (k) Interim Financing. During the period from the execution of
this Agreement through the earlier of the Closing Date or its termination, Andrx
shall cause to be provided to Mediconsult up to $2,000,000 in interim financing
to fund operating activities in the Ordinary Course of Business pursuant to a
credit agreement of even date herewith, which interim financing will not be used
without the prior consent of Andrx to (i) satisfy any closing conditions set
forth in Section 7; (ii) pay any severance obligations which are not being
currently paid; or (iii) pay any extraordinary expenses outside the Ordinary
Course of Business.

                  (l) Voting Agreement. Within ten days of the date of this
Agreement, Mediconsult will obtain, for the benefit of Andrx, an agreement from
Robert A. Jennings and JHC Limited whereby they agree to vote in favor of this
Agreement and the Merger in substantially the form attached as Exhibit C hereto.

         7. Conditions to Obligation to Close.

                  (a) Conditions to Obligation of Andrx and Merger Sub. The
obligation of Andrx and Merger Sub to consummate the transactions to be
performed by each in connection with the Closing is subject to satisfaction at
or prior to the Closing of the following conditions:

                           (i)      this Agreement and the Merger shall have
received the Required Mediconsult Stockholder Vote;

                           (ii)     the representations and warranties set forth
in Section 3 above shall be true and correct in all respects at and as of the
Closing Date;

                           (iii)    Mediconsult shall have performed and
complied with all of its covenants hereunder in all material respects through
the Closing;

                                      A-52

                           (iv)     no action, suit, or proceeding shall be
pending or threatened before any court or quasi-judicial or administrative
agency of any federal, state, local, or foreign jurisdiction or before any
arbitrator wherein an unfavorable injunction, judgment, order, decree, ruling,
or charge would (A) prevent consummation of any of the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement, (B) cause any of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement to be rescinded following consummation, (C) adversely affect the right
of the Surviving Corporation to own the former assets of Mediconsult, to operate
the former businesses of Mediconsult and to control the former Mediconsult, or
(D) adversely affect the right of any of the former Subsidiaries of Mediconsult
to own its assets and to operate its businesses (and no such injunction,
judgment, order, decree, ruling, or charge shall be in effect);

The parties expressly agree that, other than with respect to the condition set

pending or threatened before any court or quasi-judicial or administrative

         8. Termination.

                  (a) Termination of Agreement. At any time prior to the
Effective Time, either of the Parties may terminate this Agreement with the
prior authorization of its board of directors (whether before or after
stockholder approval) as provided below:

                           (i)      the Parties may terminate this Agreement by
mutual written consent;

                           (ii)     Andrx may terminate this Agreement by giving
written notice to Mediconsult (A) in the event Mediconsult has breached any
representation, warranty, or covenant contained in this Agreement such that the
conditions set forth in Section 7(a)(ii) would not be satisfied as of the time
of such breach or as of the time such representation or warranty shall have
become untrue; provided that Andrx has notified Mediconsult of the breach, and
if the breach is curable by Mediconsult through the exercise of its reasonable
best efforts, Andrx may not terminate pursuant to this Section 8(a)(ii)(A) for a
period of 30 days after the notice of breach, provided that Mediconsult
continues to exercise commercially reasonable efforts to cure such breach (it
being understood that Andrx may not terminate this Agreement pursuant to this
Section 8(a)(ii)(A) for such breach if such breach by Mediconsult is cured
during such 30-day period) or (B) if the Closing shall not have occurred on or
before May 15, 2001, by reason of the failure of any condition precedent under
Section 7(a) hereof (unless the failure results primarily from Andrx breaching
any representation, warranty, or covenant contained in this Agreement);

                           (iii)    Mediconsult may terminate this Agreement by
giving written notice to Andrx (A) in the event Andrx has breached any
representation, warranty, or covenant contained in this Agreement such that the
conditions set forth in Section 7(b)(iii) would not be satisfied as of the time
of such breach or as of the time such representation or warranty shall have
become untrue; provided that Mediconsult has notified Andrx of the breach, and
if the breach is curable by Andrx through the exercise of its reasonable best
efforts, Mediconsult may not terminate pursuant to this Section 8(a)(iii)(A) for
a period of 30 days after the notice of breach, provided that Andrx continues to
exercise commercially reasonable efforts to cure such breach (it being
understood that Mediconsult may not terminate this Agreement pursuant to this
Section 8(a)(iii)(A) for such breach if such breach by Andrx is cured during
such 30-day period) or (B) if the Closing shall not have occurred on or before
May 15, 2001, by reason of the failure of any condition precedent under Section
7(b) hereof (unless the failure results primarily from Mediconsult breaching any
representation, warranty, or covenant contained in this Agreement);

                                      A-56

                           (iv)     Either Party may terminate this Agreement by
giving written notice to the other at any time after the Mediconsult
Stockholders Meeting, (including any adjournment thereof) in the event this
Agreement and the Merger fail to receive the Required Mediconsult Stockholder
Vote;

                           (v)      Mediconsult may terminate this Agreement if
after receiving an unsolicited Takeover Proposal, Mediconsult's Board of
Directors in compliance with the procedures set forth in Section 6(j) determines
in good faith that such Takeover Proposal is a Superior Proposal and that it is
required by its fiduciary duty to accept such Takeover Proposal and advises
Andrx thereof; and

                           (vi)     Either Party may terminate if (A) there
shall be a final nonappealable order of a federal or state court restraining or
prohibiting the consummation of the Merger, or (B) there shall be any action
taken, or any statute, rule, regulation or order enacted, promulgated or issued
or deemed applicable to the Merger by any governmental authority, that would
make the consummation of the Merger illegal.

                  (b) Effect of Termination. If any Party terminates this
Agreement pursuant to Section 8(a) above, all rights and obligations of the
Parties hereunder shall terminate without any liability of any Party to any
other Party except (i) as otherwise provided in this Section 8 or (ii) to the
extent that such termination results from fraud or the willful or intentional
breach by any party of its representations, warranties or covenants set forth in
this Agreement or the Breakup Warrant, the purpose of which is to terminate this
Agreement in which event the breaching party shall pay to the other as
liquidated damages an amount equal to $750,000 by wire transfer to an account
designated by such party within five business days from the termination of this
Agreement; provided that (a) the provisions of Section 6(e) relating to
Confidential Information, Section 8(c) and this Section 8(b) shall remain in
full force and effect and survive any termination of this Agreement. No
termination of this Agreement shall affect the obligations of the Parties
contained in the Confidentiality Agreement, dated on or about October 9, 2000,
between Andrx and Mediconsult, all of which obligations survive the termination
of this Agreement in accordance with their terms.

                  (c) Expenses and Termination Fees.

                           (i)      Subject to Section 8(b) and subsections (ii)
and 8(c)(iii) of this Section 8(c), whether or not the Merger is consummated,
all costs and expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement, the Merger,
and the transactions contemplated hereby (including, without limitation, the
fees and expenses of its advisers, brokers, finders, agents, accountants and
legal counsel) shall be paid by the Party incurring such expense, except that
expenses incurred in connection with the filing and printing the proxy materials
and the Proxy Statement/Prospectus, registration and filing fees incurred in
connection with the Proxy Statement/Prospectus and the HSR Act shall be shared
equally by Andrx and Mediconsult.

                           (ii)     In the event that this Agreement is
terminated pursuant to Section 8(a)(ii)(B), 8(a)(iv), or 8(a)(v) or the Board of
Directors of Mediconsult changes or withdraws or modifies its recommendation of
this Agreement or the Merger or any transaction contemplated hereby in a manner
adverse to or shall have resolved to do any of the foregoing and within 12

                                      A-57

months of the date of this Agreement, Mediconsult sells the capital stock of
Physicians Online or substantially all its assets, the transaction substantially
contemplated by the Takeover Proposal is consummated, or Mediconsult consummates
a financing transaction or series of related financing transactions with net
proceeds equal to or greater than $7,500,000, Mediconsult shall pay Andrx an
amount equal to $1,000,000 by wire transfer to an account designated by Andrx
(the "Cash Breakup Fee") and issue a warrant, in a form substantially similar to
that attached hereto as Exhibit D, to purchase 19.9% of the then outstanding
shares of Mediconsult Common Stock on a fully diluted basis (the "Breakup
Warrant") with an exercise price of $0.125 per share. The Cash Breakup Fee and
Breakup Warrant shall be due and payable within five business days of the
consummation of any of the transactions mentioned in the previous sentence.
Andrx understands and agrees that the sum of the consideration of the Cash
Breakup Fee and Breakup Warrant shall not exceed the maximum consideration
permitted under the DGCL.

                           (iii)    In the event that this Agreement is
terminated pursuant to Section 8(a)(ii)(A) or 8(a)(iii)(A), the non-terminating
Party shall pay to and reimburse the terminating Party the actual out-of-pocket
expenses incurred by the terminating Party in connection with this Agreement and
the transactions contemplated hereby by wire transfer to an account designated
by the terminating Party within five business days from the non-terminating
Party's receipt of a statement from the terminating Party indicating the amount
of such out-of-pocket expenses that have been incurred. In addition, in the
event this Agreement has been terminated pursuant to Section 8(a)(ii)(A) or
8(a)(iii)(A) as a result of a nonwillful material breach of or failure to
perform the provisions of this Agreement by the non-terminating Party, the
terminating Party shall have the right to recover any damages arising from such
nonwillful breach or failure to perform.

         9. Miscellaneous.

                  (a) Survival. None of the representations, warranties,
covenants and other agreements of the Parties contained herein, other than the
provisions in Section 6(g) concerning insurance and indemnification and the

Effective Time or earlier termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.

willful breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or other agreement in

(which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed); provided,
however, that any Party may make any public disclosure it believes in good faith
is required by applicable law or any listing or trading agreement concerning its
publicly-traded securities (in which case the disclosing Party will use its best
efforts to advise the other Party and its counsel at least one day prior to
making the disclosure).

                  (c) No Third Party Beneficiaries. This Agreement shall not

Schedule) constitutes the entire agreement between the Parties and supersedes
any prior understandings, agreements, or representations by or between the
Parties, written or oral, to the extent they are related in any way to the

                                 January 9, 2001

Board of Directors
Mediconsult.com, Inc.
560 White Plains Road
Tarrytown, NY 10591

Gentlemen:

         Mediconsult.com, Inc. ("Mediconsult" or the "Company") and Andrx
Corporation ("Andrx") have proposed entering into an Agreement and Plan of
Merger among Andrx, its wholly-owned subsidiary ("Merger Sub") and Mediconsult,
as outlined in the latest draft dated January 5, 2001 (the "Merger Agreement")
pursuant to which Merger Sub will be merged into Mediconsult in a transaction
(the "Merger") in which each outstanding share of Mediconsult common stock, (the
"Mediconsult Shares"), will be converted into the right to receive 0.143 shares
(the "Exchange Ratio") as set forth in the Merger Agreement of Cybear Group
Common Stock ("Cybear Tracking Stock"). Cybear Tracking Stock is a class of
common stock issued by Andrx to track the performance of Cybear, Inc.
("Cybear"). As a result of the Merger, Mediconsult shall become a wholly-owned
subsidiary of Andrx. It is the intention of the Parties that the holders of
Mediconsult Common Stock will, as a result of the Merger, own in the aggregate
approximately 42.9% of the Cybear Tracking Stock outstanding after the Merger on
a fully diluted basis assuming no adjustment in the Exchange Ratio.

         You have asked us whether, in our opinion, the Exchange Ratio,
including potential adjustments, pursuant to the Merger Agreement is fair from a
financial point of view to the shareholders of Mediconsult, other than Andrx and
its affiliates.

         In arriving at the opinion set forth below, we have, among other
things:

1.       Reviewed certain publicly available business and financial information
         relating to Mediconsult, Andrx and Cybear that we deemed to be
         relevant;

2.       Reviewed certain confidential information furnished to us by
         Mediconsult, including financial forecasts relating to the business,
         earnings, cash flow, assets, liabilities and prospects of Mediconsult,
         and Cybear, as well as the amount and timing of synergies projected by
         management to result from the Merger;

3.       Conducted discussions with members of senior management and
         representatives of Mediconsult, Andrx and Cybear concerning the matters
         described in clauses 1 and 2 above, including assumptions of
         Mediconsult and Cybear relating to financial forecasts, as well as
         their respective businesses and prospects before and after giving
         effect to the Merger and the synergies projected by management; Visited
         the facilities of Mediconsult and Cybear;

4.       Reviewed the market prices and valuation multiples for Mediconsult
         Shares and Cybear Tracking Stock and compared them with those of
         certain publicly traded companies that we deemed to be relevant;

5.       Reviewed the results of operations of Mediconsult and Cybear and
         compared them with those of certain publicly traded companies that we
         deemed to be relevant;

                                      B-1

6.       Compared the proposed financial terms of the Merger with the financial
         terms of certain other transactions that we deemed to be relevant;

7.       Reviewed the potential pro forma financial impact of the Merger;

8.       Reviewed the latest draft dated January 5, 2001 of the Merger Agreement
         which we are advised reflects in all material aspects the final Merger
         Agreement; and

9.       Reviewed such other financial studies and analyses and took into
         account such other matters as we deemed necessary, including our
         assessment of general economic, market and monetary conditions.

         In preparing our opinion, we have assumed and relied on the accuracy
and completeness of all information supplied or otherwise made available to us
for discussion or review, as well as all information publicly available, and we
have not assumed any responsibility for independently verifying such information
nor have we undertaken an independent evaluation or appraisal of any of the
assets or liabilities of Mediconsult or Cybear or been furnished with any such
evaluation or appraisal. With respect to the financial forecast information and
the projected synergies furnished to or discussed with us by Mediconsult or
Cybear, we have assumed with your consent that they have been reasonably
prepared and reflect the best currently available estimates and judgment of
Mediconsult's or Cybear's management as to the expected future financial
performance of Mediconsult or Cybear, as the case may be, and the projected
synergies. We have further assumed with your consent that the Merger will be
accounted for as a purchase under generally accepted accounting principles and
that it will qualify as a tax-free reorganization for U.S. federal income tax
purposes.

         Our opinion is necessarily based upon market, economic and other
conditions as they exist and can be evaluated on, and on the information made
available to us as of, the date hereof. We have assumed that in the course of
obtaining the necessary regulatory or other consents or approvals (contractual
or otherwise) for the Merger, no restrictions, including any divestiture
requirements or amendments or modifications, will be imposed that will have a
material adverse effect on the contemplated benefits of the Merger.

         We have not been engaged by the Company to participate in or advise
with respect to the negotiation of the terms of the Merger or any other
alternative transaction and have not done so. Without limiting the foregoing, in
connection with the preparation of this opinion, we have not been requested by
you or by the Company to, nor did we, solicit or assist the Company in
soliciting indications of interest for the acquisition of the Company. Further,
we express no opinion herein as to the terms of any transaction related or
ancillary to the Merger, financial or otherwise such as the financings
contemplated by Mediconsult in the form of a loan(s) from Cybear in connection
with the Merger.

         We have, in the past, provided financial advisory services to
Mediconsult and have received fees for the rendering of such services. We will
receive fees, including shares of Mediconsult, for providing this fairness
opinion. In addition, Mediconsult has agreed to indemnify us for certain
liabilities arising out of our engagement.

         This opinion is for the use and benefit of the Board of Directors of
Mediconsult. Our opinion does not address the merits of the underlying decision
by Mediconsult to engage in the

                                      B-2

Merger and does not constitute a recommendation to any stockholder as to how
such stockholder should vote on the proposed Merger or any matter related
thereto.

         We are not expressing any opinion herein as to the prices at which
Mediconsult Shares or Cybear Tracking Stock will trade following the
announcement or consummation of the Merger.

         On the basis of and subject to the foregoing, we are of the opinion
that, as of the date hereof, the Exchange Ratio, including potential
adjustments, pursuant to the Merger Agreement is fair from a financial point of
view to the shareholders of Mediconsult, other than Andrx and its affiliates.

                                       Very truly yours,

                                       By: ___________________________

                                      C-2

established in accordance with Article V of the Certificate of Incorporation of
the Corporation, and references to "the Certificate of Incorporation" shall

be amended from time to time. Certain capitalized terms used in this Article
IV, shall have the meanings set forth in Section 2.6 of this Article. For
purposes of this Article IV, the Andrx Stock, when issued, shall be considered
issued in respect of the Andrx Group and the Cybear Stock, when issued, shall

shares of any class or classes of capital stock of the Corporation may be
increased or decreased (but not below the number of shares thereof then
outstanding) by the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the voting
power of the stock of the Corporation entitled to vote generally in the
election of directors.

     Section 2. Common Stock. The voting powers, preferences and relative,
participating, optional or other special rights of the Common Stock, and the
qualifications and restrictions thereon, shall be as follows in this Section 2.

       Section 2.1 Dividends. Subject to any preferences and relative,
participating, optional or other special rights of any outstanding class or
series of preferred stock of the Corporation and any qualifications or
restrictions on either class of Common Stock created thereby, dividends may be
declared and paid upon either class of Common Stock, upon the terms with
respect to each such class, and subject to the limitations provided for below
in this Section 2.1, as the Board of Directors may determine.

      (a) Dividends on Andrx Stock. Dividends on Andrx Stock may be declared
and paid only out of the lesser of (i) the funds of the Corporation legally
available therefor and (ii) the Andrx Group Available Dividend Amount.

      (b) Dividends on Cybear Stock. Dividends on Cybear Stock may be declared
and paid only out of the lesser of (i) the funds of the Corporation legally
available therefor and (ii) the Cybear Group Available Dividend Amount.

      (c) Discrimination in Dividends Between Classes of Common Stock. The
Board of Directors, subject to the provisions of Sections 2.1(a) and 2.1(b),
may at any time declare and pay dividends exclusively on Andrx Stock,
exclusively on Cybear Stock, or on both such classes, in equal or unequal
amounts, notwithstanding the relative amounts of the Available Dividend Amount
with respect to either Group, the amount of dividends previously declared on
either class, the respective voting or liquidation rights of either class or
any other factor.

      (d) Share Distributions. Except as permitted by Sections 2.4(a), the
Board of Directors may declare and pay dividends or distributions of shares of
Andrx Stock or Cybear Stock (or Convertible Securities convertible into or
exchangeable or exercisable for shares of Andrx Stock or Cybear Stock) on
shares of a class of Common Stock or shares of a class or series of preferred
stock of the Corporation only as follows:

       (i)     dividends or distributions of shares of Andrx Stock (or
               Convertible Securities convertible into or exchangeable or
               exercisable for shares of Andrx Stock) on shares of Andrx Stock
               or shares of preferred stock attributed to the Andrx Group;

       (ii)    dividends or distributions of shares of Cybear Stock (or
               Convertible Securities convertible into or exchangeable or
               exercisable for shares of Cybear Stock) on shares of Cybear
               Stock or shares of preferred stock attributed to the Cybear
               Group; and

       (iii)   dividends or distributions of shares of Cybear Stock (or
               Convertible Securities convertible into or exchangeable or
               exercisable for shares of Cybear Stock) on

                                      C-3

               shares of Andrx Stock or shares of preferred stock attributed to
               the Andrx Group, but only if the sum of (1) the number of shares
               of Cybear Stock to be so issued (or the number of such shares
               which would be issuable upon conversion, exchange or exercise of
               any Convertible Securities to be so issued) and (2) the number
               of shares of Cybear Stock which are issuable upon conversion,
               exchange or exercise of any Convertible Securities then
               outstanding that are attributed to the Andrx Group is less than
               or equal to the Number of Cybear Group Designated Shares.

       Section 2.2 Voting Rights. (a) General. Except as otherwise provided by
law, by the terms of any outstanding class or series of preferred stock of the
Corporation or by any provision of the Certificate of Incorporation restricting
the power to vote on a specified matter to other stockholders, the entire
voting power of the stockholders of the Corporation shall be vested in the
holders of the Common Stock, who shall be entitled to vote on any matter on
which the holders of stock of the Corporation shall by law or by the provisions
of the Certificate of Incorporation or Bylaws of the Corporation (the
"Bylaws"), be entitled to vote, and both classes of Common Stock shall vote
thereon together as a single class.

        (b) Number of Votes for each Class of Common Stock. On each matter to be
            voted on by the holders of both classes of Common Stock voting
            together as a single class, the number of votes per share of each
            class shall be as follows:

              (i)    each outstanding share of Andrx Stock shall have one vote;
                     and

              (ii)   each outstanding share of Cybear Stock shall have a number
                     of votes (including a fraction of one vote) equal to the
                     quotient (rounded to the nearest three decimal places) of
                     the average Market Value of one share of Cybear Stock
                     during the 20-Trading-Day Period ending on the tenth
                     Trading Day prior to the record date for determining the
                     stockholders entitled to vote, divided by the average
                     Market Value of a share of Andrx Stock during such
                     20-Trading Day period; provided, however, that in the event
                     the foregoing calculation results in the holders of Cybear
                     Stock holding in excess of 30% of the total voting power of
                     all outstanding shares of Common Stock, the vote of each
                     share of Cybear Stock shall be reduced such that all of the
                     outstanding shares of Cybear Stock in the aggregate
                     represent 25% of the total voting power of all outstanding
                     shares of Common Stock.

       Notwithstanding the foregoing, if shares of only one class of Common
Stock are outstanding on the record date for determining the holders of Common
Stock entitled to vote on any matter, then each share of that class shall be
entitled to one vote and, if either class of Common Stock is entitled to vote
as a separate class with respect to any matter, each share of that class shall,
for purpose of such vote, be entitled to one vote on such matter.

        (c) Class Vote of Cybear Stock. The holders of Cybear Stock, voting as a
            separate class, shall be entitled to approve by the affirmative vote
            of the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares any
            amendment, alteration or repeal of any provision of the Certificate
            of Incorporation which adversely affects the rights, powers, or
            privileges of the Cybear Stock.

        (d) Class Vote of Andrx Stock. The holders of Andrx Stock, voting as a
            separate class, shall be entitled to approve by the affirmative vote
            of the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares any
            amendment, alteration or repeal of any provision of the Certificate
            of Incorporation which adversely affects the rights, powers, or
            privileges of the Andrx Stock.

       Section 2.3 Liquidation Rights. In the event of any voluntary or
involuntary dissolution, liquidation or winding up of the Corporation, after
payment or provision for payment of the debts and

                                      C-4

other liabilities of the Corporation and the full preferential amounts
(including any accumulated and unpaid dividends) to which the holders of any
outstanding shares of preferred stock of the Corporation are entitled
(regardless of the Group to which such shares of preferred stock were
attributed), the holders of the Andrx Stock and Cybear Stock shall be entitled
to receive the assets, if any, of the Corporation remaining for distribution to
holders of Common Stock on a per share basis (regardless of the Group to which
such assets are attributable) in proportion to the respective liquidation units
per share of such class. Each share of Andrx Stock shall have one liquidation
unit and each share of Cybear Stock shall have a number of liquidation units
(including a fraction of one liquidation unit) equal to the quotient (rounded
to the nearest five decimal places) of the average Market Value of one share of
Cybear Stock during the 20-Trading Day period ending on the 40th Trading Day
after the effective date of this Certificate of Incorporation, divided by the
average Market Value of one share of Andrx Stock during such 20-Trading Day
period. Neither the merger nor consolidation of the Corporation into or with
any other corporation, nor a sale, transfer or lease of all or any part of the
assets of the Corporation, shall, alone, be deemed a liquidation or winding up
of the Corporation or cause the dissolution of the Corporation, for purposes of
this Section 2.3.

       If the Corporation shall in any manner subdivide (by stock split,
reclassification or otherwise) or combine (by reverse stock split,
reclassification or otherwise) the outstanding shares of Andrx Stock or Cybear
Stock, or declare a dividend in shares of either class to holders of such
class, the per share liquidation units of either class of Common Stock
specified in the preceding paragraph of this Section 2.3, as adjusted from time
to time, shall be appropriately adjusted as determined by the Board of

                     of Cybear Stock, properly endorsed or assigned for transfer
                     (unless the Corporation shall waive such requirement). The
                     Corporation shall as soon as practicable after receipt of
                     certificates representing such shares of Cybear Stock
                     deliver to the person for whose account such shares of
                     Cybear Stock were so surrendered, or to such person's
                     nominee or nominees, the cash and/ or the certificates or
                     instruments representing the number of whole shares of the
                     kind of capital stock and/or other securities or property
                     to which such person shall be entitled as aforesaid,
                     together with any payment in respect of fractional shares
                     contemplated by Section 2.4(d)(ix), in each case without
                     interest. If less than all of the shares of Cybear Stock
                     represented by any one certificate are to be redeemed, the
                     Corporation shall issue and deliver a new certificate for
                     the shares of Cybear Stock not redeemed.

              (xi)   From and after any applicable Conversion Date or Redemption
                     Date, as the case may be, all rights of a holder of shares
                     of Cybear Stock that were converted or redeemed shall cease
                     except for the right, upon surrender of the certificates
                     representing such shares of Cybear Stock as required by
                     Section 2.4(d)(xi), to receive the cash and/or the
                     certificates or instruments representing shares of the kind
                     and amount of capital stock and/or other securities or
                     property for which such shares were converted or redeemed,
                     together with any payment in respect of fractional shares
                     contemplated by Section 2.4(d)(viii) (which shall be held
                     by the Corporation for the holder of such shares of Cybear
                     Stock that were redeemed

                                      C-12

                     until the receipt of certificates representing such shares
                     of Cybear Stock as provided in Section 2.4(d)(xi)) and
                     rights to dividends as provided in Section 2.4(d)(x), in
                     each case without interest. No holder of a certificate that
                     immediately prior to the applicable Conversion Date or
                     Redemption Date represented shares of a class of Cybear
                     Stock shall be entitled to receive any dividend or other
                     distribution or interest payment with respect to shares of
                     any kind of capital stock or other security or instrument
                     for which Cybear Stock was converted or redeemed until the
                     surrender as required by this Section 2.4 of such
                     certificate in exchange for a certificate or certificates
                     or instrument or instruments representing such capital
                     stock or other security. Subject to applicable escheat and
                     similar laws, upon such surrender, there shall be paid to
                     the holder the amount of any dividends or other
                     distributions (without interest) which theretofore became
                     payable on any class or series of capital stock of the
                     Corporation as of a record date after the Conversion Date
                     or Redemption Date, but that were not paid by reason of the
                     foregoing, with respect to the number of whole shares of
                     the kind of capital stock represented by the certificate or
                     certificates issued upon such surrender. From and after a
                     Conversion Date or Redemption Date, the Corporation shall,
                     however, be entitled to treat the certificates for Cybear
                     Stock that have not yet been surrendered for conversion or
                     redemption as evidencing the ownership of the number of
                     whole shares of the kind or kinds of capital stock of the
                     Corporation for which the shares of Cybear Stock
                     represented by such certificates shall have been converted
                     or redeemed, notwithstanding the failure to surrender such
                     certificates.

              (xii)  The Corporation shall pay any and all documentary, stamp or
                     similar issue or transfer taxes that may be payable in
                     respect of the issuance or delivery of any shares of
                     capital stock and/or other securities upon conversion or
                     redemption of shares of Cybear Stock pursuant to this
                     Section 2.4. The Corporation shall not, however, be
                     required to pay any tax that may be payable in respect of
                     any transfer involved in the issuance or delivery of any
                     shares of capital stock and/or other securities in a name
                     other than that in which the shares of Cybear Stock so
                     converted or redeemed were registered, and no such issuance
                     or delivery shall be made unless and until the person
                     requesting such issuance or delivery has paid to the
                     Corporation the amount of any such tax or has established
                     to the satisfaction of the Corporation that such tax has
                     been paid.

              (xiii) Neither the failure to mail any notice required by this
                     Section 2.4 to any particular holder of Cybear Stock or of
                     Convertible Securities nor any defect therein shall affect
                     the sufficiency thereof with respect to any other holder of
                     outstanding shares of Cybear Stock or of Convertible
                     Securities or the validity of any such conversion or
                     redemption.

              (xiv)  The Board of Directors may establish such rules and
                     requirements to facilitate the effectuation of the
                     transactions contemplated by this Section 2.4 as the Board
                     of Directors shall determine to be appropriate.

     Section 2.5 Application of the Provisions of Article IV.

     (a)  Certain Determinations by the Board of Directors. The Board of
          Directors shall make such determinations with respect to the
          businesses, assets, properties and liabilities to be attributed to the
          Groups, the application of the provisions of the Certificate of
          Incorporation to transactions to be engaged in by the Corporation and
          the voting powers, preferences and relative, participating, optional
          and other special rights of the holders of Cybear Stock, and the
          qualifications and restrictions thereon, provided by the Certificate
          of Incorporation as may be or become necessary or appropriate to the

                                      C-13

          exercise of such powers, preferences and relative, participating,
          optional and other special rights, including, without limiting the
          foregoing, the determinations referred to in this Section 2.5. A
          record of any such determination shall be filed with the records of
          the actions of the Board of Directors.

          (i)       Upon any acquisition by the Corporation or its subsidiaries
                    of any assets or business, or any assumption of liabilities,
                    outside of the ordinary course of business of the Andrx
                    Group or the Cybear Group, as the case may be, the Board of
                    Directors shall determine whether such assets, business and
                    liabilities (or an interest therein) shall be for the
                    benefit of the Andrx Group or the Cybear Group or that an
                    interest therein shall be partly for the benefit of the
                    Andrx Group and partly for the benefit of the Cybear Group
                    and, accordingly, shall be attributed to the Andrx Group or
                    the Cybear Group, or partly to each, in accordance with
                    Section 2.6(c) or 2.6(f), as the case may be.

          (ii)      Upon any issuance of any shares of Cybear Stock at a time
                    when the Number of Cybear Group Designated Shares is greater
                    than zero, the Board of Directors shall determine, based on
                    the use of the proceeds of such issuance and any other
                    relevant factors, whether all or any part of the shares of
                    Cybear Stock so issued shall reduce the Number of Cybear
                    Group Designated Shares and the Number of Cybear Group
                    Designated Shares shall be adjusted accordingly.

          (iii)     Upon any issuance by the Corporation or any subsidiary
                    thereof of any Convertible Securities that are convertible
                    into or exchangeable or exercisable for shares of Cybear
                    Stock, if at the time such Convertible Securities are issued
                    the Number of Cybear Group Designated Shares is greater than
                    zero, the Board of Directors shall determine, based on the
                    use of the proceeds of such issuance and any other relevant
                    factors, whether, upon conversion, exchange or exercise
                    thereof, the issuance of shares of Cybear Stock pursuant
                    thereto shall, in whole or in part, reduce the Number of
                    Cybear Group Designated Shares and the Number of Cybear
                    Group Designated Shares shall be adjusted accordingly.

          (iv)      Upon any issuance of any shares of any class or series of
                    preferred stock of the Corporation, the Board of Directors
                    shall attribute, based on the use of proceeds of such
                    issuance of shares of preferred stock in the business of the
                    Andrx Group or the Cybear Group and any other relevant
                    factors, the shares so issued entirely to the Andrx Group or
                    entirely to the Cybear Group or partly to the Andrx Group
                    also partly to the Cybear Group in such proportion as the
                    Board of Directors shall determine.

          (v)       Upon any redemption or repurchase by the Corporation or any
                    subsidiary thereof of shares of preferred stock of any class
                    or series or of other securities or debt obligations of the
                    Corporation, the Board of Directors shall determine, based
                    on the property used to redeem or purchase such shares,
                    other securities or debt obligations, which, if any, of such
                    shares, other securities or debt obligations redeemed or
                    repurchased shall be attributed to the Andrx Group and
                    which, if any, of such shares, other securities or debt
                    obligations shall be attributed to the Cybear Group and,
                    accordingly, how many of the shares of such class or series
                    of preferred stock or of such other securities, or how much
                    of such debt obligations, that remain outstanding, if any,
                    are thereafter attributed to the Andrx Group or the Cybear
                    Group.

     (b)  Sources of Dividends and Distributions; Use of Proceeds of Share
          Issuances. Notwithstanding the attribution of properties or assets of
          the Corporation to the Andrx Group or Cybear Group as provided by
          Section 2.6(c) or Section 2.6(f), but

                                      C-14

          subject to the limitations of Section 2.1(a), 2.1(b), and 2.1(d), the
          Board of Directors (i) may cause dividends or distributions or other
          payments to the holders of any class of Common Stock or any class or
          series of Preferred Stock to be made out of the properties or assets
          attributed to any Group, subject, however, to any contrary term or
          any series of Preferred Stock fixed in accordance with Section 3, and
          (ii) may cause the proceeds of issuance of any shares of Andrx Stock
          or Cybear Stock or any class or series of Preferred Stock, to
          whichever Group attributable in accordance with Section 2.5(a)(iv),
          to be used in the business of, and to be attributed either to the
          Andrx Group in accordance with Section 2.6(c) or to the Cybear Group
          in accordance with Section 2.6(f).

     (c)  Certain Determinations Not Required. Notwithstanding the foregoing
          provisions of this Section 2.5, the provisions of Section 2.6(c) or
          2.6(f) or any other provision of the Certificate of Incorporation, at
          any time when there are not outstanding both (i) one or more shares of
          Andrx Stock or Convertible Securities convertible into or exchangeable
          or exercisable for Andrx Stock and (ii) one or more shares of Cybear
          Stock or Convertible Securities convertible into or exchangeable or
          exercisable for Cybear Stock, the Corporation need not (A) attribute
          any of the assets or liabilities of the Corporation or any of its
          subsidiaries to the Andrx Group or the Cybear Group or (B) make any
          determination required in connection therewith, nor shall the Board of
          Directors be required to make any of the determinations otherwise
          required by this Article, and in such circumstances the holders of the
          shares of Andrx Stock and Cybear Stock outstanding, as the case may
          be, shall (unless otherwise specifically provided by the Certificate
          of Incorporation) be entitled to all the voting powers, preferences
          and relative, participating, optional and other special rights of both
          classes of Common Stock without differentiation between the Andrx
          Stock and the Cybear Stock.

     (d)  Board Determinations Binding. Subject to applicable law, any
          determinations made in good faith by the Board of Directors of the
          Corporation under any provision of this Section 2.5 or otherwise in
          furtherance of the application of this Section 2 shall be final and
          binding on all stockholders.

       Section 2.6 Certain Definitions. As used in the Certificate of
Incorporation, the following terms shall have the following meanings (with
terms defined in the singular having comparable meaning when used in the plural
and vice versa), unless the context otherwise requires. As used in this Section
2.6, a "contribution" or "transfer" of assets or properties from one Group to
another shall refer to the reattribution of such assets or properties from the
contributing or transferring Group to the other Group and correlative phrases
shall have correlative meanings.

          loss of the Andrx Group for such period determined in accordance with
          generally accepted accounting principles in effect at such time,

          Andrx Group on a basis substantially consistent with attributions of
          income and expense made in the calculation of Andrx Corporation
          Earnings (Loss) Attributable to the Cybear Group, including, without
          limitation, corporate administrative costs, net interest and other
          financial costs and income taxes, increased by (ii) the amount

                                      C-15

          calculation of Andrx Group Earnings (Loss) Attributable to the Andrx
          Corporation, including, without limitation, corporate administrative

          reduced by (ii) the aggregate amount of consolidated allowable tax
          benefits for federal income tax purposes generated by the Cybear
          Group for such period which cannot be utilized by the Cybear Group
          but can be utilized by the Corporation on a consolidated basis for
          such period to the extent such amount was included in the calculation
          of net income or loss under clause (i) for such period ("Excludable
          Cybear Group Tax Benefits").

     (c)  Andrx Group shall mean, as of any date:

          (i)       the interest of the Corporation or any of its subsidiaries
                    on such date in all of the businesses, assets, properties
                    and liabilities of the Corporation or any of its

                    pursuant to transactions in the ordinary course of business
                    of the Andrx Group and the Cybear Group or otherwise as the
                    Board of Directors may have directed as permitted by the
                    Certificate of Incorporation;

          (iii)     all properties and assets transferred to the Andrx Group

                    the Andrx Group, as determined by the Board of Directors as
                    contemplated by Section 2.5(a)(i);

     provided that from and after any transfer of any assets or properties from
the Andrx Group to the Cybear Group, the Andrx Group shall no longer include

                    assets attributed to the Andrx Group less the total
                    liabilities attributed to the Andrx Group (provided that
                    preferred stock shall not be treated as a liability), in
                    each case, as of such date and determined on a basis
                    consistent with that applied in determining Andrx Group
                    Earnings (Loss) Attributable to the Andrx Group, minus (ii)
                    the aggregate par value of, or any greater amount determined
                    in accordance with applicable law to be capital in respect
                    of, all outstanding shares of Andrx Stock and each class or
                    series of preferred stock attributed in accordance with the
                    Certificate of Incorporation to the Andrx Group, or

     Section 1. Number and Term of Directors. The Board of Directors shall
consist of not less than three nor more than twelve members, with the exact
number to be fixed from time to time in the manner provided in the Bylaws. No
decrease in the number of directors shall have the effect of shortening the
term of any incumbent director. The Board of Directors shall be divided into
three classes. The number of directors elected to each class shall be as nearly
equal in number as possible. Each director in the first class shall be elected
to an initial term expiring at the next ensuing annual meeting of stockholders,
each director in the second class shall be elected to an initial term expiring
at the annual meeting of stockholders held one year thereafter and each
director in the third class shall be elected to an initial term expiring at the
annual meeting of stockholders held one year thereafter, in each case until his
or her successor us duly elected and qualified or until his or her earlier
resignation, death, incapacity or removal from office. Upon the expiration of
the initial terms of office for each class of directors, the successor
directors of each class shall be elected for a full term of three years, to
serve until their successors are duly elected and qualified or until their
earlier resignation, death, incapacity or removal from office. The Board of
Directors shall apportion any increase or decrease in the number of directors
among the classes as nearly equal in number as possible.

     Section 2. Vacancies. Whenever any vacancy on the Board of Directors shall
occur due to death, resignation, retirement, disqualification, removal,
increase in the number of directors, or

                                      C-22

otherwise, a majority of the remaining directors in office, although less than
a quorum of the Board of Directors, may fill the vacancy for the balance of the
unexpired term of the vacant directorship, at which time a successor or
successors shall be duly elected by the stockholders and qualified.
Notwithstanding the provisions of any other Article hereof, only the remaining
directors of the Corporation shall have the authority, in accordance with the
procedure stated herein, to fill any vacancy that arises on the Board of
Directors.

     Section 3. Removal. A director may be removed from office prior to the
expiration of his or her term: (i) only for cause; and (ii) only upon the
affirmative vote of at least two-thirds of the outstanding shares of capital
stock of the Corporation entitled to vote for the election of directors.

     Section 4. Amendments. Notwithstanding anything contained in this
Certificate of Incorporation to the contrary, this Article VI shall not be
altered, amended or repealed except by an affirmative vote of at least
two-third of the outstanding shares of capital stock of the Corporation
entitled to vote for the election of directors.

                                 ARTICLE VII.

                       LIMITATION ON DIRECTOR LIABILITY

     A director shall not be personally liable to the Corporation or its
stockholders for monetary damages for breach of fiduciary duty as a director,
except for liability (i) for any breach of the director's duty of loyalty to
the Corporation or its stockholders, (ii) for acts or omissions not in good
faith or which involve intentional misconduct or a knowing violation of law,
(iii) under Section 174 of the DGCL, or (iv) for any transaction from which
such director derives an improper personal benefit. This Article VII shall be
read to authorize the limitation of liability to the fullest extent permitted
under Delaware law. If the DGCL is hereafter amended to authorize the further
or broader elimination or limitation of the personal liability of directors,
then the liability of a director of the Corporation shall be eliminated or
limited to the fullest extent permitted by the DGCL, as so amended. No repeal
or modification of this Article VII shall adversely affect any right of or
protection afforded to a director of the Corporation existing immediately prior
to such repeal or modification.

                                 ARTICLE VIII.

                       SPECIAL MEETINGS OF STOCKHOLDERS

     Except as otherwise require by law and subject to the rights of the
holders of the Preferred Stock, special meetings of the stockholders of the

resolution approved by a majority of the entire Board of Directors, (ii) the
Corporation's Chief Executive Officer or (iii) the holders of at least
one-third of the outstanding shares of capital stock of the Corporation.
Notwithstanding anything contained in this Certificate of Incorporation to the
contrary, this Article VIII shall not be altered, amended or repealed except by
an affirmative vote of at least two-thirds of the outstanding shares of capital
stock of the Corporation entitled to vote at a stockholders' meeting duly
called for such purpose.

the contrary, this Article IX shall not be altered, amended or repealed except

appropriate or advisable.

                                  ARTICLE XI.

                                    BYLAWS

Incorporation to the contrary, this Article XI shall not be altered, amended or
repealed except by an affirmative vote of at least two-thirds of the
outstanding shares of capital stock of the Corporation entitled to vote at a

                                        ANDRX CORPORATION

                                        By:
                                            ------------------------------------
                                            Name:
                                                 -------------------------------
                                            Title:
                                                  ------------------------------

                                      C-24

                                     ANNEX D

                                ANDRX CORPORATION
    Common Stock Policies Governing the Interests of Andrx Corporation to be
             Allocated Between the Andrx Group and the Cybear Group

General

         Because the Andrx Group and the Cybear Group will each be a part of a
single company, Andrx Corporation, a Delaware corporation (the "Company") has
carefully considered a number of issues with respect to the financing of the
Andrx Group and the Cybear Group, competition between the Groups, inter-Group
business transactions, corporate opportunities and the allocation of debt,
corporate overhead, interest, taxes and other charges between the two Groups.
The Company's board of directors (the "Board") and management have established
policies to accomplish the fundamental objectives of the merger and
reorganization (collectively, the "Reorganization"). These policies establish
guidelines to help the Company allocate costs and charges between the two Groups
on an objective basis and, except as described below, to ensure that
transactions between the Andrx Group and the Cybear Group are made on terms that
approximate the terms that could be obtained from unaffiliated third parties.
All capitalized terms used but not defined herein have the respective meaning
assigned thereto in the Company's Restated Certificate of Incorporation (the
"Certificate of Incorporation").

Policies Subject to Change Without Shareholder Approval

         These policies will be effective upon the Reorganization. The Company
is not requesting shareholder approval of these policies.

         The Board may modify or rescind these policies, or may adopt additional
policies, in its sole discretion without shareholder approval, subject to any
limitations imposed by the Board's fiduciary duties and applicable law. However,
the Board has no present plans to modify or rescind these policies or to adopt
additional policies inconsistent with these policies. The Board's decision to
modify or rescind such policies, or adopt additional policies could have
different effects upon holders of Andrx Stock and holders of Cybear Stock or
could result in a benefit or detriment to one class of stockholders compared to
the other class. The Board would make any such decision in accordance with its
good faith business judgment that such decision is in the best interests of the
Company and all of its stockholders as a whole.

Interests to be Attributed to the Andrx Group and the Cybear Group

         It is the current intent of the Company to attribute to the Cybear
Group all of the Company's interests worldwide in Internet business related to
the healthcare industry other than any Internet business related to the
marketing, manufacture, purchase, warehousing, developing, sale and distribution
of pharmaceuticals. All other Company interests not allocated to the Cybear
Group will be allocated to the Andrx Group.

Fiduciary and Management Responsibilities

         Because the Andrx Group and the Cybear Group will be a part of a single
company, the directors and officers will have the same fiduciary duties both to
holders of the Andrx Stock

                                      D-1

and the holders of the Cybear Stock. Under Delaware law, absent an abuse of
discretion, a director or officer will be deemed to have satisfied his or her
fiduciary duties to the Company and its stockholders if that person is
disinterested and acts in accordance with his or her good faith business
judgment in the interests of the Company and all of its stockholders as a whole.
The Board, in establishing policies with regard to intracompany matters such as
business transactions between Groups and allocations of assets, liabilities,
debt, corporate overhead, taxes, interest, corporate opportunities and other
matters, will consider various factors and information which could benefit or
cause detriment to the stockholders of the respective Groups and will make
determinations in the best interests of the Company and all of its stockholders
as a whole.

         The officers of Andrx Corporation prior to the Reorganization will be
the officers of the Company subsequent to the Reorganization, and they will hold
the positions they held previously and will continue to have the same general
responsibilities that they had prior to the Reorganization. The costs
attributable to their responsibilities will be allocated as discussed below
under "Financial Statements; Allocation Matters - Corporate Overhead and
Administrative Shared Services."

         The Company's chief executive officer, with the approval of the Board,
has designated separate management teams for each of the Andrx Group and the
Cybear Group to ensure that the efforts of each team of managers are focused on
the business and operations for which they have responsibility.

Common Stock Ownership of Directors and Senior Officers

         As a policy, the Board will periodically monitor the ownership of
shares of Andrx Stock and shares of Cybear Stock by its directors and senior
officers and its option grants to them so that their interests are generally
aligned with the two classes of common stock and with their duty to act in the
best interests of the Company and its stockholders as a whole. However, because
of the anticipated differences in trading values between the Andrx Stock and the
Cybear Stock, the actual value of their interests in the Andrx Stock and Cybear
Stock may vary significantly.

Financing Activities/Treasury and Cash Management Policies

         The Company will manage most financing and treasury activities on a
centralized basis. These activities include, but are not limited to, the
issuance and repayment of short-term and long-term debt and the issuance and
repurchase of any preferred stock. Each of the Andrx Group and the Cybear Group
will remit its cash receipts to the Company and the Company will fund each
Group's cash disbursements on a daily basis. If the Company transfers cash or
other property allocated to one Group to the other Group, it will account for
such transfer in one of the following ways, as determined by the Board, except
as set forth in the Tax Sharing Agreement entered into between the Company and
its subsidiaries dated the Effective Date (the "Tax Sharing Agreement"):

         o  As a short-term or long-term loan from one Group to the other, or as
            a repayment of a previous borrowing, as described under "Inter-Group
            Loans" below;

                                      D-2

         o  As an increase or decrease in the Number of Cybear Designated
            Shares, as described under "Future Equity Contributions to be
            Reflected as the Number Designated Shares" below; or

         o  As a sale of assets between the two Groups.

         The Board has not adopted specific criteria to determine which of the
foregoing will be applied to a particular transfer of cash or property from one
Group to the other. The Board will make these determinations, either in specific
instances or by setting applicable policies generally, in the exercise of its
business judgment based on all relevant circumstances. The Company will make all
transfers of material assets from one Group to the other on a fair value basis
for the foregoing purposes, as determined by the Board. See "Transfers of Assets
Between Groups."

         Company Debt. The Company will allocate its debt between the Groups or,
if it so determines, in its entirety to a particular Group. If the Company
allocates debt for a particular financing in its entirety to one Group, the
interest rate, amortization, maturity, redemption and other terms shall be on
then prevailing terms on which the Andrx Group could borrow such funds. Any
expense related to debt that is allocated in its entirety to a Group will be
allocated in whole to that Group.

         Preferred Stock. The Company will allocate preferred stock, if issued,
between the Groups or, if it so determines, in its entirety to a particular
Group. If the Company allocates preferred stock for a particular financing in
its entirety to one Group, that Group will be charged the dividend cost. If the
dividend cost is higher than the Company's actual cost, the other Group will
receive a credit for an amount equal to the difference as compensation for the
use of its credit capacity. Any expense related to preferred stock that is
allocated in its entirety to a Group will be allocated in whole to that Group.

         Inter-Group Loans. If the Board decides to account for a transfer of
cash or other property from one Group to the other Group as a short-term or
long-term loan, the Board will establish the terms on which such short-term or
long-term loans between the Groups will be made, including interest rate,
amortization schedule, maturity and redemption terms; provided, however, any
cash transfers from one Group to the other Group will have interest rates,
amortization, maturity, redemption and other terms that reflect the then
prevailing terms on which the Andrx Group could borrow such funds.

         Future Equity Contributions to be Reflected as the Number of Cybear
Designated Shares. Cash or other property that the Company allocates to the
Andrx Group that is contributed as additional equity to the Cybear Group will
increase the Number of Cybear Designated Shares. Cash or other property that the
Company allocates to the Cybear Group that is transferred to the Andrx Group
will, if so determined by the Board, decrease the Number of Cybear Designated
Shares.

         Equity Issuances and Repurchases and Dividends. The Company will
reflect all financial effects of issuances and repurchases of shares of Andrx
Stock or Cybear Stock entirely in the financial statements of that Group except
as described in the next sentence. The Company will reflect all financial
effects of issuances of additional shares of Cybear Stock, which have been
reflected as a reduction in the Number of Cybear Designated Shares, entirely in
the financial statements of the Andrx Group. The Company will reflect financial
effects of

                                      D-3

dividends or other distributions on, and purchases of, shares of Andrx Stock or
Cybear Stock entirely in the respective financial statements of the Andrx Group
and the Cybear Group.

Competition Between Groups

         Neither the Andrx Group nor the Cybear Group intend to engage in each
other's principal businesses. To the extent practicable, the Groups shall
establish joint ventures or other collaborative arrangements to develop, market,
sell and support new products and services where both Groups principal
businesses are involved. Third parties may also participate in such joint
transactions. See "Transfers of Assets Between Groups - Joint Transactions." The
terms of any joint transactions will be determined by the Board. Any existing or
subsequently developed Internet and Internet-based applications of the Andrx
Group which is either related to its pharmaceuticals business or is not related
to the healthcare industry shall not be deemed as competing with the Cybear
Group.

         The Board will make decisions whether to permit indirect competition
between the Groups. Indirect competition could occur if and when:

         o  one Group uses products of third parties in that Group's products
            rather than using the other Group's products;

         o  a third party uses a product of one Group in the third party's
            products which compete with the other Group's products; or

         o  a Group licenses technology allocated to that Group to a third party
            that is a competitor of the other Group.

         The Groups may compete in a business which is not a principal business
of the other Group.

Transfers of Assets Between Groups

         The Articles of Incorporation permits the transfer of assets between
Groups without shareholder approval. The Board has determined that all such
transfers will be made at fair value, as determined by the Board, except as
described below. The consideration for such transfers may be paid by one Group
to the other in cash or other consideration, as determined by the Board.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, all cash and cash equivalents on the balance
sheet of the Cybear Group as of the effective date of the Reorganization (the
"Effective Date") shall be used by the Cybear Group only to fund Cybear Group's
operations.

         The Board has adopted specific policies for the sale of products and
services between Groups and joint transactions with each other and third parties
as set forth below.

         Sales of Products and Services Between Groups. A Group will sell
products or services to the other Group on terms that would be available from
third parties in commercial transactions. If terms for such transactions are not
available from a third party, the purchasing Group will (1) pay for such
products at fair value as determined by the Board and (2) pay for

                                      D-4

such services at fair value, as determined by the Board, or at the cost,
including overhead, of the selling Group.

         Joint Transactions. The Groups may from time to time engage in
transactions jointly, including with third parties, as described under
"Competition Between Groups." Research and development and other services
performed by one Group for a joint venture or other collaborative arrangement
will be charged at fair value, as determined by the Board. The Company will
continue to cause the Andrx Group to provide to the Cybear Group, at no cost or
expense to the Cybear Group, telemarketing and distribution services in
connection with the "Cybear Marketplace" operations.

         Review of Corporate Opportunities

         The Board will review any matter which involves the allocation of a
corporate opportunity to either the Andrx Group or the Cybear Group or in part
to the Andrx Group and in part to the Cybear Group. In accordance with Delaware
law, the Board will make its determination with regard to the allocation of any
such opportunity and the benefit of such opportunity in accordance with its good
faith business judgment of the best interests of the Company and all of its
stockholders as a whole. Among the factors that the Board may consider in making
this allocation is whether a particular corporate opportunity is principally
related to the business of the Andrx Group or the Cybear Group; whether one
Group, because of its managerial or operational expertise, will be better
positioned to undertake the corporate opportunity; and existing contractual
agreements and restrictions.

         Financial Statements

         The Company will prepare financial statements in accordance with
generally accepted accounting principles, consistently applied, for the Andrx
Group and the Cybear Group, and these financial statements, taken together, will
comprise all of the accounts included in the Company's corresponding
consolidated financial statements. The financial statements of each of the Andrx
Group and the Cybear Group will reflect the financial condition, results of
operations and cash flows of the businesses included therein.

         Allocation Matters

         Group financial statements will also include allocated portions of the
Company's debt, interest, and corporate overhead and costs of administrative
shared services. The Company will make these allocations for the purpose of
preparing each Group's financial statements; however, holders of Andrx Stock and
Cybear Stock will continue to be subject to all of the risks associated with an
investment in the Company and all of its businesses, assets and liabilities.

         In addition to allocating debt and interest as described above under
"Financing Activities" and assets as described above under "Transfers of Assets
Between Groups," the Board has adopted the following allocation policies:

         o  Direct Charges. The Company will allocate to a Group all direct
            expenses incurred on behalf of such Group.

                                      D-5

         o  Corporate Overhead and Administrative Shared Services. The Company
            will allocate a portion of its corporate overhead to the Andrx Group
            and the Cybear Group based upon the use of services by that Group.
            Corporate overhead includes, but is not limited to, costs of the
            Company's executive management, payroll, human resources, legal,
            auditing, tax, mergers and acquisitions, treasury, and strategic
            planning functions. The Company will allocate in a similar manner a
            portion of its costs of administrative shared services, such as
            information technology services. Where determinations based on use
            alone are not practical, the Company will use other methods and
            criteria that it believes are equitable and provide a reasonable
            estimate of the cost attributable to the Groups. The allocated costs
            of providing such services and facilities will include, among other
            things, the following:

                           All costs and expenses of personnel employed in
                           connection with the services and facilities,
                           including all direct costs of those personnel, for
                           example payroll, payroll taxes and fringe benefit
                           costs, calculated at the appropriate annual composite
                           rate therefor.

                           All overhead costs and expenses directly related to
                           the personnel, and the services or facilities
                           provided by them, including departmental, divisional
                           and administrative overhead and a reasonable
                           allocation of capital charges for assets used to
                           provide these services or facilities, including
                           equipment and training.

         All materials used in connection with the services or facilities,
billed at their net cost to the provider of the services or facilities plus all
overhead costs and expenses related to the materials, including departmental,
divisional and administrative overhead and a reasonable allocation of capital
charges for assets used to provide the materials.

         The corporate general and administrative services and facilities to be
allocated between the Groups will include general and administrative services
and facilities (for example, legal services, accounting services, tax and
financial services, treasury services, telemarketing services, purchasing and
material procurement, corporate travel, information systems support and
corporate offices, warehouses and other facilities).

         The Company will allocate consolidated federal income tax provisions
and related tax payments or refunds between the Groups based on the Tax Sharing
Agreement.

Capital Stock Committee

         At the Effective Time of the Reorganization, the Company will amend its
bylaws and take whatever other action is required to establish a capital stock
committee of the Company's Board (the "Capital Stock Committee"). To the extent
the Cybear nominee to the Board is a member of the Board, Cybear's nominee shall
be a member of the Capital Stock Committee, however, in the event that Cybear's
nominee is a member of the Capital Stock Committee, the Capital Stock Committee
shall have at least one other member. The Capital Stock Committee will have
authority to:

                                      D-6

         o  Interpret, make determinations under, and oversee the implementation
            of these policies in order to resolve potential and actual conflicts
            between the Groups.

         o  Adopt additional general policies governing the relationship between
            the Andrx Group and the Cybear Group with respect to these policies;
            and

         o  Engage the services of accountants, investment bankers, appraisers,
            attorneys and other service providers to assist in discharging its
            duties.

         The Capital Stock Committee's decision-making authority shall not
extend to general supervision and management of the business enterprises of
either Group. Furthermore, the decisions of the Capital Stock Committee shall be
subject to ultimate approval of the Company's Board.

                        DELAWARE GENERAL CORPORATION LAW

Section 262.      Appraisal rights

         (a) Any stockholder of a corporation of this State who holds shares of
stock on the date of the making of a demand pursuant to subsection (d) of this
section with respect to such shares, who continuously holds such shares through
the effective date of the merger or consolidation, who has otherwise complied
with subsection (d) of this section and who has neither voted in favor of the
merger or consolidation nor consented thereto in writing pursuant to ss. 228 of
this title shall be entitled to an appraisal by the Court of Chancery of the
fair value of the stockholder's shares of stock under the circumstances
described in subsections (b) and (c) of this section. As used in this section,
the word "stockholder" means a holder of record of stock in a stock corporation
and also a member of record of a nonstock corporation; the words "stock" and
"share" mean and include what is ordinarily meant by those words and also
membership or membership interest of a member of a nonstock corporation; and the
words "depository receipt" mean a receipt or other instrument issued by a
depository representing an interest in one or more shares, or fractions thereof,
solely of stock of a corporation, which stock is deposited with the depository.

         (b) Appraisal rights shall be available for the shares of any class or
series of stock of a constituent corporation in a merger or consolidation to be
effected pursuant to ss.251 (other than a merger effected pursuant to ss.251(g)
of this title), ss.252, ss.254, ss.257, ss.258, ss.263 or ss.264 of this title:

                         (1) Provided, however, that no appraisal rights under
this section shall be available for the shares of any class or series of stock,
which stock, or depository receipts in respect thereof, at the record date fixed
to determine the stockholders entitled to receive notice of and to vote at the
meeting of stockholders to act upon the agreement of merger or consolidation,
were either (i) listed on a national securities exchange or designated as a
national market system security on an interdealer quotation system by the
National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. or (ii) held of record by more
than 2,000 holders; and further provided that no appraisal rights shall be
available for any shares of stock of the constituent corporation surviving a
merger if the merger did not require for its approval the vote of the
stockholders of the surviving corporation as provided in subsection (f) of
ss.251 of this title.

                         (2) Notwithstanding paragraph (1) of this subsection,
appraisal rights under this section shall be available for the shares of any
class or series of stock of a constituent corporation if the holders thereof are
required by the terms of an agreement of merger or consolidation pursuant to
ss.ss. 251, 252, 254, 257, 258, 263 and 264 of this title to accept for such
stock anything except:

                              a. Shares of stock of the corporation surviving or
resulting from such merger or consolidation, or depository receipts in respect
thereof;

                              b. Shares of stock of any other corporation, or
depository receipts in respect thereof, which shares of stock (or depository
receipts in respect thereof) or depository receipts at the effective date of the
merger or consolidation will be either listed on a national securities exchange
or designated as a national market system security on an interdealer quotation
system by the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. or held of record
by more than 2,000 holders;

                              c. Cash in lieu of fractional shares or fractional
depository receipts described in the foregoing subparagraphs a. and b. of this
paragraph; or
                                      E-1

                              d. Any combination of the shares of stock,
depository receipts and cash in lieu of fractional shares or fractional
depository receipts described in the foregoing subparagraphs a., b. and c. of
this paragraph.

                  (3) In the event all of the stock of a subsidiary Delaware
corporation party to a merger effected under ss.253 of this title is not owned
by the parent corporation immediately prior to the merger, appraisal rights
shall be available for the shares of the subsidiary Delaware corporation.

         (c) Any corporation may provide in its certificate of incorporation
that appraisal rights under this section shall be available for the shares of
any class or series of its stock as a result of an amendment to its certificate
of incorporation, any merger or consolidation in which the corporation is a
constituent corporation or the sale of all or substantially all of the assets of
the corporation. If the certificate of incorporation contains such a provision,
the procedures of this section, including those set forth in subsections (d) and
(e) of this section, shall apply as nearly as is practicable.

         (d)      Appraisal rights shall be perfected as follows:

                  (1) If a proposed merger or consolidation for which appraisal
rights are provided under this section is to be submitted for approval at a
meeting of stockholders, the corporation, not less than 20 days prior to the
meeting, shall notify each of its stockholders who was such on the record date
for such meeting with respect to shares for which appraisal rights are available
pursuant to subsection (b) or (c) hereof that appraisal rights are available for
any or all of the shares of the constituent corporations, and shall include in
such notice a copy of this section. Each stockholder electing to demand the
appraisal of such stockholder's shares shall deliver to the corporation, before
the taking of the vote on the merger or consolidation, a written demand for
appraisal of such stockholder's shares. Such demand will be sufficient if it
reasonably informs the corporation of the identity of the stockholder and that
the stockholder intends thereby to demand the appraisal of such stockholder's
shares. A proxy or vote against the merger or consolidation shall not constitute
such a demand. A stockholder electing to take such action must do so by a
separate written demand as herein provided. Within 10 days after the effective
date of such merger or consolidation, the surviving or resulting corporation
shall notify each stockholder of each constituent corporation who has complied
with this subsection and has not voted in favor of or consented to the merger or
consolidation of the date that the merger or consolidation has become effective;
or

                  (2) If the merger or consolidation was approved pursuant to
ss.228 or ss.253 of this title, each constituent corporation, either before the
effective date of the merger or consolidation or within ten days thereafter,
shall notify each of the holders of any class or series of stock of such
constituent corporation who are entitled to appraisal rights of the approval of
the merger or consolidation and that appraisal rights are available for any or
all shares of such class or series of stock of such constituent corporation, and
shall include in such notice a copy of this section; provided that, if the
notice is given on or after the effective date of the merger or consolidation,
such notice shall be given by the surviving or resulting corporation to all such
holders of any class or series of stock of a constituent corporation that are
entitled to appraisal rights. Such notice may, and, if given on or after the
effective date of the merger or consolidation, shall, also notify such
stockholders of the effective date of the merger or consolidation. Any
stockholder entitled to appraisal rights may, within 20 days after the date of
mailing of such notice, demand in writing from the surviving or resulting
corporation the appraisal of such holder's shares. Such demand will be
sufficient if it reasonably informs the corporation of the identity of the
stockholder and that the stockholder intends thereby to demand the appraisal of
such holder's shares. If such notice did not notify stockholders of the
effective date of the merger or consolidation, either (i) each such constituent
corporation shall send a second notice before the effective date of the merger
or consolidation notifying each of the holders of any class or series of stock
of such constituent corporation that are entitled to appraisal rights
of the effective date of the merger or consolidation or (ii) the surviving or
resulting corporation shall send such a second notice to all such holders on or
within 10 days after such effective date; provided, however, that if such second
notice is sent more than 20 days following the sending of the first notice, such
second notice need only be sent to each stockholder who is entitled to appraisal

                                      E-2

rights and who has demanded appraisal of such holder's shares in accordance with
this subsection. An affidavit of the secretary or assistant secretary or of the
transfer agent of the corporation that is required to give either notice that
such notice has been given shall, in the absence of fraud, be prima facie
evidence of the facts stated therein. For purposes of determining the
stockholders entitled to receive either notice, each constituent corporation may
fix, in advance, a record date that shall be not more than 10 days prior to the
date the notice is given, provided, that if the notice is given on or after the
effective date of the merger or consolidation, the record date shall be such
effective date. If no record date is fixed and the notice is given prior to the
effective date, the record date shall be the close of business on the day next
preceding the day on which the notice is given.

         (e) Within 120 days after the effective date of the merger or
consolidation, the surviving or resulting corporation or any stockholder who has
complied with subsections (a) and (d) hereof and who is otherwise entitled to
appraisal rights, may file a petition in the Court of Chancery demanding a
determination of the value of the stock of all such stockholders.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, at any time within 60 days after the effective
date of the merger or consolidation, any stockholder shall have the right to
withdraw such stockholder's demand for appraisal and to accept the terms offered
upon the merger or consolidation. Within 120 days after the effective date of
the merger or consolidation, any stockholder who has complied with the
requirements of subsections (a) and (d) hereof, upon written request, shall be
entitled to receive from the corporation surviving the merger or resulting from
the consolidation a statement setting forth the aggregate number of shares not
voted in favor of the merger or consolidation and with respect to which demands
for appraisal have been received and the aggregate number of holders of such
shares. Such written statement shall be mailed to the stockholder within 10 days
after such stockholder's written request for such a statement is received by the
surviving or resulting corporation or within 10 days after expiration of the
period for delivery of demands for appraisal under subsection (d) hereof,
whichever is later.

         (f) Upon the filing of any such petition by a stockholder, service of a
copy thereof shall be made upon the surviving or resulting corporation, which
shall within 20 days after such service file in the office of the Register in
Chancery in which the petition was filed a duly verified list containing the
names and addresses of all stockholders who have demanded payment for their
shares and with whom agreements as to the value of their shares have not been
reached by the surviving or resulting corporation. If the petition shall be
filed by the surviving or resulting corporation, the petition shall be
accompanied by such a duly verified list. The Register in Chancery, if so
ordered by the Court, shall give notice of the time and place fixed for the
hearing of such petition by registered or certified mail to the surviving or
resulting corporation and to the stockholders shown on the list at the addresses
therein stated. Such notice shall also be given by 1 or more publications at
least 1 week before the day of the hearing, in a newspaper of general
circulation published in the City of Wilmington, Delaware or such publication as
the Court deems advisable. The forms of the notices by mail and by publication
shall be approved by the Court, and the costs thereof shall be borne by the
surviving or resulting corporation.

         (g) At the hearing on such petition, the Court shall determine the
stockholders who have complied with this section and who have become entitled to
appraisal rights. The Court may require the stockholders who have demanded an
appraisal for their shares and who hold stock represented by certificates to
submit their certificates of stock to the Register in Chancery for notation
thereon of the pendency of the appraisal proceedings; and if any stockholder
fails to comply with such direction, the Court may dismiss the proceedings as to
such stockholder.

         (h) After determining the stockholders entitled to an appraisal, the
Court shall appraise the shares, determining their fair value exclusive of any
element of value arising from the accomplishment or expectation of the merger or
consolidation, together with a fair rate of interest, if any, to be paid upon
the amount determined to be the fair value. In determining such fair value, the
Court shall take into account all relevant factors. In determining the fair rate
of interest, the Court may consider all relevant factors, including the rate of
interest which the surviving or resulting corporation would have had to pay to
borrow money during the pendency of the proceeding. Upon application by the
surviving or resulting

                                      E-3

corporation or by any stockholder entitled to participate in the appraisal
proceeding, the Court may, in its discretion, permit discovery or other pretrial
proceedings and may proceed to trial upon the appraisal prior to the final
determination of the stockholder entitled to an appraisal. Any stockholder whose
name appears on the list filed by the surviving or resulting corporation
pursuant to subsection (f) of this section and who has submitted such
stockholder's certificates of stock to the Register in Chancery, if such is
required, may participate fully in all proceedings until it is finally
determined that such stockholder is not entitled to appraisal rights under this
section.

         (i) The Court shall direct the payment of the fair value of the shares,
together with interest, if any, by the surviving or resulting corporation to the
stockholders entitled thereto. Interest may be simple or compound, as the Court
may direct. Payment shall be so made to each such stockholder, in the case of
holders of uncertificated stock forthwith, and the case of holders of shares
represented by certificates upon the surrender to the corporation of the
certificates representing such stock. The Court's decree may be enforced as
other decrees in the Court of Chancery may be enforced, whether such surviving
or resulting corporation be a corporation of this State or of any state.

         (j) The costs of the proceeding may be determined by the Court and
taxed upon the parties as the Court deems equitable in the circumstances. Upon
application of a stockholder, the Court may order all or a portion of the
expenses incurred by any stockholder in connection with the appraisal
proceeding, including, without limitation, reasonable attorney's fees and the
fees and expenses of experts, to be charged pro rata against the value of all
the shares entitled to an appraisal.

         (k) From and after the effective date of the merger or consolidation,
no stockholder who has demanded appraisal rights as provided in subsection (d)
of this section shall be entitled to vote such stock for any purpose or to
receive payment of dividends or other distributions on the stock (except
dividends or other distributions payable to stockholders of record at a date
which is prior to the effective date of the merger or consolidation); provided,
however, that if no petition for an appraisal shall be filed within the time
provided in subsection (e) of this section, or if such stockholder shall deliver
to the surviving or resulting corporation a written withdrawal of such
stockholder's demand for an appraisal and an acceptance of the merger or
consolidation, either within 60 days after the effective date of the merger or
consolidation as provided in subsection (e) of this section or thereafter with
the written approval of the corporation, then the right of such stockholder to
an appraisal shall cease. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no appraisal proceeding
in the Court of Chancery shall be dismissed as to any stockholder without the
approval of the Court, and such approval may be conditioned upon such terms as
the Court deems just.

         (l) The shares of the surviving or resulting corporation to which the
shares of such objecting stockholders would have been converted had they
assented to the merger or consolidation shall have the status of authorized and
unissued shares of the surviving or resulting corporation.

                                    PART II

                     INFORMATION NOT REQUIRED IN PROSPECTUS

Item 20: Indemnification of Directors and Officers.

     Section 145 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, or the DGCL, empowers
a corporation to indemnify its directors and officers and to purchase insurance
with respect to liability arising out of their capacity or status as directors
and officers. In addition, Section 102(b)(7) of the DGCL empowers a corporation
to add a provision to its certificate of incorporation limiting the personal
liability of its directors to the corporation and its stockholders for monetary
damages for breach of fiduciary duty as a director; provided that this
provision shall not eliminate or limit the liability of a director: (1) for any
breach of the director's duty of loyalty to the corporation or its
stockholders, (2) for acts or omissions not in good faith or which involve
intentional misconduct or a knowing violation of law, (3) under Section 174 of
the DGCL, or (4) for any transaction from which the director derived an
improper personal benefit. The DGCL provides further that the indemnification
permitted thereunder shall not be deemed exclusive of any other rights to which
the directors and officers may be entitled under a corporation's by-laws, any
agreement, a vote of stockholders or otherwise. The Andrx Corporation
certificate of incorporation eliminates the personal liability of directors to
the fullest extent permitted by Section 102(b)(7) of the DGCL and provides that
it may fully indemnify any person who was or is a party or is threatened to be
made a party to any threatened, pending or completed action, suit or proceeding
(whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative) by reason of the
fact that such person is or was an Andrx Corporation director or officer or is
or was serving at Andrx Corporation's request as a director or officer of
another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust, employee benefit plan
or other enterprise, against expenses (including attorney's fees), judgments,
fines and amounts paid in settlement actually and reasonably incurred by such
person in connection with such action, suit or proceeding.

     Insofar as indemnification for liabilities arising under the Securities
Act may be permitted to directors, officers or persons controlling the
registrant pursuant to the foregoing provisions, the registrant has been
informed that in the opinion of the Securities and Exchange Commission such
indemnification is against public policy as expressed in the Act and is
therefore unenforceable.

Item 22: Undertakings

   (a) The Registrant undertakes:

      (1) The undersigned registrant hereby undertakes that, for purposes of
          determining any liability under the Securities Act of 1933, each
          filing of the registrant's annual report

                                      II-2

         pursuant to section 13(a) or section 15(d) of the Securities Exchange
         Act of 1934 (and, where applicable, each filing of an employee benefit
         plan's annual report pursuant to section 15(d) of the Securities
         Exchange Act of 1934) that is incorporated by reference in the
         registration statement shall be deemed to be a new registration
         statement relating to the securities offered therein, and the offering
         of such securities at that time shall be deemed to be the initial bona
         fide offering thereof.

      (2) Insofar as indemnification for liabilities arising under the
          Securities Act may be permitted to directors, officers and
          controlling persons of the registrant pursuant to the foregoing
          provisions, or otherwise, the registrant has been advised that, in
          the opinion of the Securities and Exchange Commission, such
          indemnification is against public policy as expressed in the
          Securities Act and is, therefore, unenforceable. In the event that a
          claim for indemnification against such liabilities (other than the
          payment by the registrant of expenses incurred or paid by a director,
          officer or controlling person of the registrant in the successful
          defense or any action, suit or proceeding) is asserted by such
          director, officer or controlling person in connection with the
          securities being registered, the registrant will, unless in the
          opinion of its counsel the matter has been settled by controlling
          precedent, submit to a court of appropriate jurisdiction the question
          whether such indemnification by it is against public policy as
          expressed in the Securities Act and will be governed by the final
          adjudication of such issue.

   (b) The undersigned registrant hereby undertakes to respond to requests for
       information that is incorporated by reference into the prospectus
       pursuant to Item 4, 10(b), 11, or 13 of this form, within one business
       day of receipt of such request, and to send the incorporated documents
       by first class mail or other equally prompt means. This includes
       information contained in documents filed subsequent to the effective
       date of the registration statement through the date of responding to the
       request.

   (c) The undersigned registrant hereby undertakes to supply by means of a
       post-effective amendment all information concerning a transaction, and
       the company being acquired involved therein, that was not the subject of
       and included in the registration statement when it became effective.

     Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended,
the Registrant certifies that it has reasonable grounds to believe that it
meets all of the requirements for filing on Form S-4 and has duly caused this

duly authorized, in the City of Fort Lauderdale, State of Florida, on February
