THE INFORMATION IN THIS PROSPECTUS MAY BE CHANGED. TITAN CORPORATION MAY NOT
SELL THESE SECURITIES UNTIL THE REGISTRATION STATEMENT FILED WITH THE SECURITIES
AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION IS EFFECTIVE. THIS PROSPECTUS IS NOT AN OFFER TO SELL
THESE SECURITIES AND TITAN CORPORATION IS NOT SOLICITING OFFERS TO BUY THESE

                                  [TITAN LOGO]

              OFFER TO EXCHANGE OUTSTANDING SHARES OF COMMON STOCK
         (INCLUDING THE ASSOCIATED PREFERRED STOCK PURCHASE RIGHTS) OF

                        DATRON SYSTEMS INCORPORATED FOR

                             SHARES OF COMMON STOCK
           (INCLUDING THE ASSOCIATED PREFERRED STOCK PURCHASE RIGHTS)
                            OF THE TITAN CORPORATION

    THE EXCHANGE OFFER AND WITHDRAWAL RIGHTS WILL EXPIRE AT 12:00 MIDNIGHT, NEW
YORK CITY TIME, ON FRIDAY, AUGUST 3, 2001, UNLESS THE OFFER IS EXTENDED. SHARES
TENDERED PURSUANT TO THIS EXCHANGE OFFER MAY BE WITHDRAWN AT ANY TIME PRIOR TO
THE EXPIRATION OF THE EXCHANGE OFFER, BUT NOT DURING ANY SUBSEQUENT OFFERING
PERIOD.

    On June 24, 2001, The Titan Corporation, or Titan, entered into a merger
agreement with Datron Systems Incorporated, or Datron, providing for a
subsidiary of Titan to acquire all of the outstanding shares of Datron common
stock by means of an exchange offer and a subsequent merger. Datron's board of
directors unanimously approved the merger agreement, determined that the
exchange offer and the merger together are fair to, and in the best interests
of, Datron and its stockholders and unanimously recommends that Datron
stockholders accept the exchange offer and tender their shares pursuant to the
exchange offer.

    Titan, through its wholly-owned subsidiary Gem Acquisition Corp., is
offering to exchange a number of shares of Titan common stock (including the
associated preferred stock purchase rights) determined pursuant to an exchange
ratio, described below, for each outstanding share of Datron common stock
(including the associated preferred stock purchase rights) that is validly
tendered and not properly withdrawn. The exchange ratio is a fraction, rounded
to the fifth decimal point, equal to the quotient of a Datron common stock value
divided by the Titan common stock price as described below. The Datron common
stock value will be determined by dividing $51,226,912 by the number of shares
of Datron common stock outstanding as of, or issuable upon the exercise of stock
options or other rights to acquire shares of Datron common stock outstanding as
of, the date that shares of Datron common stock are accepted for payment
pursuant to the exchange offer. In determining the exchange ratio, the price of
Titan common stock will be based on the average closing sales prices for shares
of Titan common stock during the 10-day trading period ending on July 27, 2001.

    If the average closing sales price of Titan common stock is (1) greater than
or equal to $17.50 per share and less than $19.00 per share, then the exchange
ratio will be equal to the Datron common stock value divided by $19.00,
(2) greater than or equal to $19.00 per share and less than or equal to $26.00
per share, then the exchange ratio will be equal to the Datron common stock
value divided by the average closing sales price of Titan common stock,
(3) greater than $26.00 per share and less than or equal to $27.50 per share,
then the exchange ratio will be equal to the Datron common stock value divided
by $26.00, (4) greater than $27.50 per share, then Titan may elect to terminate
the offer unless Datron agrees to an exchange ratio equal to the product of 1.10
and the Datron common stock value divided by the average closing sales price of
Titan common stock, or, if Titan does not elect to terminate the offer, the
exchange ratio will be equal to the Datron common stock value divided by $26.00,
and (5) less than $17.50 per share, then Datron may elect to terminate the offer
unless Titan agrees to an exchange ratio equal to the product of 0.90 and the
Datron common stock value divided by the average closing sales price of Titan
common stock, or, if Datron does not elect to terminate the offer, the exchange
ratio will be equal to the Datron common stock value divided by $19.00.

    On July 27, 2001, Titan fixed the Titan common stock price for use in
computing the exchange ratio. The exact exchange ratio will be calculated based
upon $19.544, the average closing sales price for shares of Titan common stock
during the 10-day trading period ending on July 27, 2001.

    If completed, the exchange offer will be followed by a merger of Gem
Acquisition Corp. into Datron in which shares of Datron common stock will be
converted into shares of Titan common stock at the same exchange ratio used in
the exchange offer. After completion of the merger, Datron will be a
wholly-owned subsidiary of Titan.

    Titan's obligation to exchange its common stock for Datron common stock in
the exchange offer is subject to the conditions listed in the section entitled
"CERTAIN TERMS OF THE MERGER AGREEMENT--CONDITIONS TO THE EXCHANGE OFFER." Titan
common stock is listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol "TTN" and
Datron common stock is listed on the Nasdaq National Market under the symbol
"DTSI."

FACTORS THAT YOU SHOULD CONSIDER IN CONNECTION WITH THE EXCHANGE OFFER.

              QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS ABOUT THE PROPOSED TRANSACTION

Q: WHAT ARE TITAN AND DATRON PROPOSING?

    A: Titan and Datron have entered into a merger agreement, pursuant to which
Titan is offering to exchange shares of Titan common stock for all of the
outstanding shares of Datron common stock. If the exchange offer is completed,
Gem Acquisition Corp., a wholly-owned subsidiary of Titan, will merge with
Datron. As a result of the exchange offer and the merger, Datron will become a
wholly-owned subsidiary of Titan.

Q: WHAT WOULD I RECEIVE IN EXCHANGE FOR MY SHARES OF DATRON COMMON STOCK?

    A: In exchange for your shares of Datron common stock, you will receive
shares of Titan common stock. The number of shares of Titan common stock that
you will receive will be determined by an exchange ratio, rounded to the fifth
decimal point, equal to the quotient of the Datron common stock value, divided
by the Titan common stock price as described below. The Datron common stock
value will be determined by dividing $51,226,912 by the number of shares of
Datron common stock outstanding as of, or issuable upon the exercise of stock
options or other rights to acquire shares of Datron common stock outstanding as
of, the date that shares of Datron common stock are accepted for payment
pursuant to the exchange offer. If the average closing sales price of Titan
common stock is (1) greater than or equal to $17.50 per share and less than
$19.00 per share, then the exchange ratio will be equal to the Datron common
stock value divided by $19.00, (2) greater than or equal to $19.00 per share and
less than or equal to $26.00 per share, then the exchange ratio will be equal to
the Datron common stock value divided by the average closing sales price of
Titan common stock, (3) greater than $26.00 per share and less than or equal to
$27.50 per share, then the exchange ratio will be equal to the Datron common
stock value divided by $26.00, (4) greater than $27.50 per share, then Titan may
elect to terminate the offer unless Datron agrees to an exchange ratio equal to
the product of 1.10 and the Datron common stock value divided by the average
closing sales price of Titan common stock, or, if Titan does not elect to
terminate the offer, the exchange ratio will be equal to the Datron common stock
value divided by $26.00, and (5) less than $17.50 per share, then Datron may
elect to terminate the offer unless Titan agrees to an exchange ratio equal to
the product of 0.90 and the Datron common stock value divided by the average
closing sales price of Titan common stock, or, if Datron does not elect to
terminate the offer, the exchange ratio will be equal to the Datron common stock
value divided by $19.00. On July 27, 2001, Titan fixed the Titan common stock
price for use in computing the exchange ratio. The exact exchange ratio will be
calculated based upon $19.544, the average closing sales price for shares of
Titan common stock during the 10-day trading period ending on July 27, 2001.
Titan will not issue any fractional shares of common stock in connection with
the exchange offer or the merger. Datron stockholders will instead receive cash
for any fractional shares otherwise issuable to them. For a complete description
of the exchange ratio, please see "THE TRANSACTION--THE EXCHANGE RATIO."

Q: HOW CAN I FIND OUT THE FINAL EXCHANGE RATIO?

    A: We will notify you by issuing a press release announcing the final
exchange ratio and filing that press release with the Securities and Exchange
Commission. Datron stockholders can call our information agent, D.F.
King & Co., Inc., at any time toll free at (800) 628-8510 for the Titan average
closing price for the preceding 10 trading days and the exchange ratio that
would be in effect based on that price. On July 27, 2001, Titan fixed the Titan
common stock price for use in computing the exchange ratio. The exact exchange
ratio will be calculated based upon $19.544, the average closing sales price for
shares of Titan common stock during the 10-day trading period ending on
July 27, 2001. For a table illustrating examples of Titan average closing
prices, the resulting exchange ratios and illustrations of the approximate value
you would receive for your Datron shares, please see "THE

TRANSACTION--ILLUSTRATIVE TABLE OF EXCHANGE RATIOS AND VALUE OF OFFER/MERGER
CONSIDERATION" beginning on page 36.

Q: IS THE EXCHANGE OFFER BEING MADE BY TITAN OR GEM ACQUISITION CORP.?

    A: The exchange offer is technically being made by Gem Acquisition Corp.,
which was formed by Titan specifically for the purpose of making the exchange
offer and otherwise facilitating the transaction. Because Gem Acquisition Corp.
is a wholly-owned transitory subsidiary of Titan, all of the shares of Datron
common stock acquired by Gem Acquisition Corp. in the exchange offer will
actually be beneficially owned and controlled by Titan. Therefore, although Gem
Acquisition Corp. is technically making the exchange offer and will be a party
to the merger, when we discuss the exchange offer and the merger, we generally
refer only to Titan.

Q: HOW LONG WILL IT TAKE TO COMPLETE THE EXCHANGE OFFER AND THE MERGER?

    A: Titan hopes to complete the exchange offer by August 3, 2001. Titan
expects to complete the merger shortly after it completes the exchange offer,
or, if stockholder approval for the merger is required, shortly after the
special meeting of Datron stockholders to approve the merger.

Q: DO I HAVE TO PAY ANY BROKERAGE FEES OR COMMISSIONS?

    A: If you are the record owner of your shares and you tender your shares in
the exchange offer, you will not incur any brokerage fees or commissions. If you
own your shares through a broker or other nominee who tenders the shares on your
behalf, your broker may charge you a commission for doing so. You should consult
with your broker or nominee to determine whether any charges will apply.

Q: WHEN AND HOW CAN I WITHDRAW TENDERED SHARES?

    A: You may withdraw any shares you have tendered at any time prior to the
expiration date as it may be extended, and, unless Titan has accepted and paid
for these shares, you may also withdraw any shares you have tendered at any time
on or after August 3, 2001.

    For a withdrawal to become effective, Titan must receive a written or
facsimile transmission notice of withdrawal by the specified time. In a notice
of withdrawal you must specify your name, the number of shares to be withdrawn
and the name in which the certificates are registered, if different from your
name. If you have delivered to us certificates for shares to be withdrawn, you
must also indicate the serial numbers shown on the particular certificates
evidencing the shares to be withdrawn.

Q: WHAT ARE THE MOST SIGNIFICANT CONDITIONS TO THE EXCHANGE OFFER?

    A: Titan's obligation to accept shares of Datron common stock for exchange
in the exchange offer is subject to several conditions, including:

    - a majority of the outstanding shares of Datron common stock having been
      validly tendered and not properly withdrawn, which is referred to in this
      prospectus as the "minimum tender condition;"

    - the registration statement of which this prospectus is a part having been
      declared effective by the Securities and Exchange Commission; and

    - Datron having not materially breached any covenant in the merger
      agreement, and its representations and warranties in the merger agreement
      being accurate in all material respects.

    These and other conditions to the exchange offer are discussed in this
prospectus in the section entitled "CERTAIN TERMS OF THE MERGER
AGREEMENT--CONDITIONS TO THE EXCHANGE OFFER" beginning on page 77.

Q: HOW DO I PARTICIPATE IN THE EXCHANGE OFFER?

    A: You are urged to read this entire prospectus carefully, and to consider
how the exchange offer and the merger affect you. Then, if you wish to tender
your shares of Datron common stock, you should complete and sign the enclosed
letter of transmittal and return it with your stock certificates to the
designated exchange agent, or, if you hold your shares in "street name" through
a broker, ask your broker to tender your shares. Please read this prospectus
carefully for more information about procedures for tendering your shares, the
timing of the exchange offer, extensions of the exchange offer period and your
rights to withdraw your shares from the exchange offer prior to the expiration
date.

Q: WHAT HAPPENS IF I DO NOT TENDER MY SHARES OF DATRON COMMON STOCK?

    A: If, after completion of the exchange offer, Titan owns a majority of the
outstanding shares of Datron common stock, it intends to complete a merger of
its wholly-owned subsidiary, Gem Acquisition Corp., with Datron. Upon completion
of the merger, each share of Datron common stock that has not been tendered and
accepted for exchange in the exchange offer will be converted into shares of
Titan common stock at the same exchange ratio used in the exchange offer.

Q: WILL I BE TAXED ON THE TITAN SHARES I RECEIVE?

    A: Your receipt of shares of Titan common stock in the transaction will be
tax-free for U.S. federal income tax purposes (except for taxes, if any,
resulting from the receipt of cash instead of fractional shares of Titan common
stock), if (1) the transaction is completed under the current terms of the
merger agreement, (2) the minimum tender condition to the exchange offer is
satisfied, and (3) the merger is completed promptly after the exchange offer.
You are urged to read the information regarding material federal income tax
consequences contained in this prospectus carefully, and to consult with your
tax advisor regarding the consequences of participation in the exchange offer
and/or the merger.

Q: DO THE STATEMENTS ON THE COVER PAGE REGARDING THIS PROSPECTUS BEING SUBJECT
   TO CHANGE AND THE REGISTRATION STATEMENT FILED WITH THE SECURITIES AND
   EXCHANGE COMMISSION NOT YET BEING EFFECTIVE MEAN THAT THE EXCHANGE OFFER HAS
   NOT YET COMMENCED?

    A: No. The exchange offer has commenced and effectiveness of the
registration statement is not necessary for you to tender shares of Datron
common stock.

Q: WHERE CAN I FIND MORE INFORMATION ABOUT TITAN AND DATRON?

    A: You can find more information about Titan and Datron as described in the
section entitled "WHERE YOU CAN FIND MORE INFORMATION," on page 118 of this
prospectus.

THE COMPANIES

    THE TITAN CORPORATION
    3033 Science Park Road
    San Diego, California 92121-1199
    Telephone: (858) 552-9500

    Titan is a diversified technology company that creates, builds and launches
technology-based businesses. Titan Systems, Titan's government business, is a
key provider of information technology and communications solutions, services
and products in the growing federal government information technology market.
Titan Systems also serves as Titan's engine, providing Titan with
government-funded research and development activities that generate technology
and intellectual property that often form the foundation for Titan's commercial
technology applications and new businesses as well as cash flow to fund those
businesses. Titan has developed and continues to develop new businesses, like
its SureBeam and Titan Wireless businesses, from the broad portfolio of
technologies, intellectual property and expertise that Titan has created and
continues to create as part of its work under government contracts and its
self-funded research and development program. In addition, Titan's existing
commercial businesses sometimes generate technologies that can be developed into
other new businesses.

    Titan has worked under government contracts totaling in excess of
$2.0 billion in revenues since 1981. Titan's government contracts generally
permit Titan to retain intellectual property rights in commercial applications
of technologies developed under those contracts. Titan has also supplemented its
internally developed portfolio with technologies, intellectual property and
expertise through strategic

acquisitions of other government information technology companies. Titan's
strategy is to leverage its intellectual property portfolio by creating
commercial technology applications or individual businesses that can be
monetized through either an initial public offering of a subsidiary, a complete
spin-off to Titan's stockholders, an outright sale of a business, or a
technology license or sale.

    Titan has organized its business into four core segments that reflect the
specific markets and industries in which it operates: Titan Systems, SureBeam,
Titan Wireless and Cayenta. In addition, Titan's Emerging Technologies and
Businesses segment develops commercial applications and businesses for
technologies created or acquired by Titan.

    TITAN SYSTEMS provides information technology and communications solutions,
services and products for defense, intelligence, and other U.S. and allied
government agencies.

    SUREBEAM provides electronic food irradiation systems and services.

    TITAN WIRELESS provides satellite-based and wireless-based communication
services and systems which provide cost-effective voice, facsimile, data,
Internet and network communications services in developing countries.

    CAYENTA is a total services provider of information technology services and
software applications for its customers' businesses and governmental functions.

    Titan's EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES AND BUSINESSES segment currently has several
new businesses in development, including businesses in which Titan has applied
for patent protection for the underlying technology.

    Titan maintains a site on the Internet at www.titan.com; however,
information found on Titan's website is not part of this prospectus.

incorporated on June 19, 2001, in the State of Delaware. Gem Acquisition Corp.
has not engaged in any operations and exists solely to make the exchange offer

only to Titan.

markets worldwide including several U.S. government customers such as the U.S.
Department of Defense. Datron was founded in 1969 and became an independent
publicly-held corporation in 1985.

    Datron operates in two business segments through two subsidiaries, Datron
Advanced Technologies Inc., or DAT, which conducts Datron's Antenna and Imaging
Systems business, and Datron World Communications, or DWC, which conducts
Datron's Communications Products business.

THE TRANSACTION (PAGE 35)

    Titan and Datron are proposing a two-part business combination transaction,
in which Titan intends to acquire all of the outstanding shares of Datron common
stock (including the associated preferred stock purchase rights). In the
exchange offer, Titan is offering to exchange a fraction of a share of Titan
common stock (including the associated preferred stock purchase rights) based on
an exchange ratio for each outstanding share of Datron common stock that is
validly tendered and not properly withdrawn. The exchange ratio is a fraction
that is based on the average closing price of Titan common stock and the Datron
common stock value. The Datron common stock value is determined by dividing
$51,226,912 by the number of shares of Datron common stock outstanding as of, or
issuable upon the exercise of stock options or other rights to acquire shares of
Datron common stock outstanding as of, the date that shares of Datron common
stock are accepted for payment pursuant to the exchange offer. The exchange
ratio is described in more detail in the section entitled "THE TRANSACTION--THE
EXCHANGE RATIO" beginning on page 35 of this prospectus.

    Promptly after completion of the exchange offer, Titan intends to merge its
wholly-owned subsidiary, Gem Acquisition Corp., with Datron. Each share of
Datron common stock which has not been tendered and accepted for exchange in the
exchange offer will be converted in the merger into shares of Titan common stock
at the same exchange ratio used in the exchange offer. Titan seeks to acquire
ownership of 100% of the outstanding shares of Datron common stock through the
exchange offer and the merger. The exchange offer and the merger are sometimes
collectively referred to in this prospectus as the "transaction."

    Titan will not issue any fractional shares of common stock in connection
with the exchange offer or the merger. Datron stockholders will instead receive
cash for any fractional shares otherwise issuable to them.

MARKET PRICE AND DIVIDEND INFORMATION (PAGE 13)

    Titan common stock is listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol
"TTN" and Datron common stock is listed on the Nasdaq National Market under the
symbol "DTSI." On June 22, 2001, the last full trading day before the public
announcement of the exchange offer and the merger, the closing sale price per
share of Titan common stock on the New York Stock Exchange Composite Tape was
$19.50 and the closing sale price per share of Datron common stock on the Nasdaq
National Market was $14.00. On July 30, 2001, the most recent practicable date
prior to the filing of this prospectus, the closing sale price per share of
Titan common stock on the New York Stock Exchange Composite Tape was $20.00 and
the closing sale price per share of Datron common stock on the Nasdaq National
Market was $16.08.

DATRON'S REASONS FOR THE EXCHANGE OFFER AND THE MERGER (PAGE 48)

    Datron's board of directors believes that the transaction could result in a
number of benefits to Datron and its stockholders. Datron's reasons for entering
into the transaction and a number of factors considered by Datron's board of
directors in determining whether to enter into the transaction are described
below.

    - The value of the Titan common stock that Datron stockholders will receive
      for their Datron common stock represents a premium over recent and
      historical prices of Datron common stock, and Titan common stock, which
      has a much larger market capitalization than Datron common stock, could
      prove to be less volatile.

    - The structure of the transaction as a tax free reorganization will allow
      Datron stockholders flexibility in their personal tax planning, permitting
      those who wish to defer taxes to do so and permitting others to sell the
      Titan common stock they receive in the transaction and pay taxes currently
      on any gain.

    - The substantial weekly trading volume of Titan common stock in comparison
      to the number of shares of Titan common stock that will be received in the
      transaction by Datron stockholders provides substantially greater
      liquidity to Datron stockholders than they have with respect to Datron
      common stock.

    - The Datron board of directors believes that the combination of Datron and
      Titan will result in strategic advantages to the combined company,
      stemming in part from complementary expertises, that may result in greater
      growth of the combined company than the two companies might acheive
      operating independently.

    - Based on Datron's experience during the nearly two years Philpott Ball &
      Werner has been seeking alternatives to maximize Datron's stockholder
      value, the Datron board of directors believes that the transaction with
      Titan represents the transaction most favorable to the Datron stockholders
      that has been or is likely to be presented to Datron.

    - The Datron board of directors believes that the merger agreement provides
      for a fair method of combining the equities of the two companies and that
      the consideration to be received by the Datron stockholders is fair to
      them.

    See the section entitled "THE TRANSACTION--DATRON'S REASONS FOR THE EXCHANGE
OFFER AND THE MERGER" on page 48 of this prospectus, as well as Datron's
Solicitation/Recommendation Statement on Schedule 14D-9, which is being mailed
to you together with this prospectus.

RECOMMENDATION TO DATRON STOCKHOLDERS

    Datron's board of directors has unanimously approved the merger agreement,
determined that the exchange offer and the merger together are advisable and
fair to and in the best interests of, Datron and its stockholders and
unanimously recommends that Datron stockholders accept the exchange offer and
tender their shares pursuant to the exchange offer. Information about the
unanimous recommendation of Datron's board of directors is more fully described
in Datron's Solicitation/ Recommendation Statement on Schedule 14D-9, which is
being mailed to you together with this prospectus.

OPINION OF DATRON'S FINANCIAL ADVISOR (PAGE 50)

    Datron has received a written opinion, dated June 22, 2001, from Philpott
Ball & Werner, to the effect that, as of the date of the opinion and based on
and subject to the matters described in its opinion, the consideration to be
received pursuant to the merger agreement was fair, from a financial point of
view, to the holders of Datron common stock (other than Titan and its
affiliates). PHILPOTT BALL & WERNER'S OPINION IS ADDRESSED TO THE DATRON BOARD
OF DIRECTORS AND DOES NOT CONSTITUTE A RECOMMENDATION TO ANY STOCKHOLDER
REGARDING WHETHER STOCKHOLDERS SHOULD TENDER SHARES PURSUANT TO THE EXCHANGE
OFFER, OR HOW STOCKHOLDERS SHOULD VOTE OR ACT ON ANY MATTER RELATING TO THE
MERGER.

TIMING OF THE EXCHANGE OFFER (PAGE 35)

    The exchange offer commenced on July 9, 2001 and is currently scheduled to
expire on August 3, 2001. However, under certain circumstances the exchange
offer may be extended.

EXTENSION; TERMINATION AND AMENDMENT (PAGE 38)

    Subject to the terms of the merger agreement, Titan has agreed to extend the
exchange offer for one 10-business day period if, on August 3, 2001, the minimum
tender condition has not been satisfied. Titan may also extend the exchange
offer for successive extension periods not in excess of 10 business days per
extension if, at the scheduled expiration date of the exchange offer, any of the
conditions to the exchange offer has not been satisfied or, where permissible,
waived. In addition, Titan is entitled to extend the exchange offer if required
by the rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission, the New York Stock
Exchange or the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. During an
extension, all shares of Datron common stock previously tendered and not
properly withdrawn will remain subject to the exchange offer, subject to your
right to withdraw your shares of Datron common stock. An extension of the
exchange offer is different than a subsequent offering period. The consequences
of a subsequent offering period are described below.

    Titan reserves the right to make any changes in the terms and conditions of
the exchange offer by giving oral or written notice of the changes to the
Exchange Agent and by making a public announcement thereof. However, without the
prior written consent of Datron, Titan cannot:

    - decrease the number of shares of Datron common stock sought in the
      exchange offer;

    - make any changes to the form or amount of consideration to be paid in
      exchange for shares of Datron common stock in the exchange offer;

    - impose any additional conditions on the exchange offer other than those
      already described in the merger agreement;

    - amend or waive the minimum tender condition or other specified conditions
      as described in the merger agreement;

    - extend the expiration date of the exchange offer, except in the
      circumstances described in the merger agreement; or

    - make any other change to the terms and conditions of the exchange offer
      which is adverse to the holders of shares of Datron common stock.

    Titan is required to follow any extension, termination, amendment or delay,
as promptly as practicable, with a public announcement. Any announcement about
an extension is required to be issued no later than 9:00 a.m., New York City
time, on the next business day after the previously scheduled expiration date of
the exchange offer. Subject to applicable law, including Rules 14d-4(d) and
14d-6(c) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, which require that any
material change in the information published, sent or given to stockholders in
connection with the exchange offer be promptly sent to stockholders in a manner
reasonably designed to inform stockholders of the change, and without limiting
the manner in which Titan may choose to make any public announcement, Titan
assumes no obligation to publish, advertise or otherwise communicate the public
announcement other than by making a release to the Dow Jones News Service.

SUBSEQUENT OFFERING PERIOD (PAGE 39)

    Titan may elect to provide a subsequent offering period of 3 to 20 business
days after the acceptance of shares of Datron common stock in the exchange offer
if the requirements of Rule 14d-11 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934
have been met. You will not have the right to withdraw any

shares of Datron common stock that you tender during the subsequent offering
period. Titan is required to accept for exchange, and to deliver shares of Titan
common stock in exchange for, shares of Datron common stock that are validly
tendered promptly after they are tendered during any subsequent offering period.
If Titan elects to provide a subsequent offering period, it is required to make
a public announcement to that effect no later than 9:00 a.m., New York City
time, on the next business day after the previously scheduled expiration date of
the exchange offer.

WITHDRAWAL RIGHTS (PAGE 40)

    Your tender of shares of Datron common stock pursuant to the exchange offer
is irrevocable, except that, other than during any subsequent offering period,
shares of Datron common stock tendered pursuant to the exchange offer may be
withdrawn at any time prior to the expiration date of the exchange offer, as it
may be extended, and unless Titan previously accepted them for exchange pursuant
to the exchange offer, may also be withdrawn at any time after August 3, 2001.

    If Titan elects to provide a subsequent offering period pursuant to
Rule 14d-11 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, you will not have the
right to withdraw shares of Datron common stock that you tender in the
subsequent offering period.

EXCHANGE OF SHARES OF DATRON COMMON STOCK; DELIVERY OF SHARES OF TITAN COMMON
  STOCK (PAGE 39)

    Upon the terms of, and subject to the conditions to, the exchange offer,
including, if the exchange offer is extended or amended, the terms and
conditions of any extension or amendment, Titan is required to accept for
exchange, and to deliver shares of Titan common stock in exchange for, shares of
Datron common stock validly tendered and not properly withdrawn, promptly after
the expiration date of the exchange offer and promptly after they are tendered
during any subsequent offering period.

PROCEDURE FOR TENDERING (PAGE 41)

    For you to validly tender shares of Datron common stock pursuant to the
exchange offer, a properly completed and duly executed letter of transmittal or
manually executed facsimile of that document, along with any required signature
guarantees, or an agent's message in connection with a book-entry transfer, and
any other required documents, must be transmitted to and received by American
Stock Transfer & Trust Company, the exchange agent for the offer, at the address
on the back cover of this prospectus. In addition, certificates for tendered
shares of Datron common stock must be received by the exchange agent at that
address, or the shares of Datron common stock must be tendered pursuant to the
procedures for book-entry tender, in each case before the expiration date of the
exchange offer.

A STOCKHOLDER VOTE MAY BE REQUIRED TO APPROVE THE MERGER (PAGE 62)

    If, after completion of the exchange offer, as it may be extended and
including any subsequent offering period, Titan owns 90% or more of the
outstanding shares of Datron common stock, the merger can be accomplished
without a vote of Datron stockholders. If, on the other hand, after completion
of the exchange offer, as it may be extended and including any subsequent
offering period, Titan owns more than 50% but less than 90% of the outstanding
shares of Datron common stock, a meeting of Datron stockholders and the
affirmative vote of at least a majority of the shares of Datron common stock
outstanding on the record date for such meeting will be needed to complete the
merger. Since Titan will own a majority of the shares of Datron common stock
outstanding on the record date, approval of the merger by Datron stockholders
will be assured.

THE STOCKHOLDER AGREEMENTS (PAGE 84)

    Datron's directors and officers who have beneficial ownership of 82,509
shares of Datron common stock in the aggregate, which represented approximately
3.0% of the outstanding shares of Datron common stock as of July 30, 2001, have
agreed to tender and not withdraw their shares of Datron common stock in the
exchange offer. In addition, the officers and directors of Datron who are
parties to the stockholder tender agreements may be obligated to exercise vested
options to purchase up to 137,849 shares of Datron common stock in the
aggregate, representing approximately 5.0% of the outstanding shares of Datron
common stock as of July 30, 2001, and tender the shares issued upon exercise of
the options if and to the extent necessary to satisfy the minimum condition for
the exchange offer.

INTERESTS OF DATRON'S OFFICERS AND DIRECTORS IN THE TRANSACTION (PAGE 56)

    When you consider Datron's board of directors' unanimous recommendation that
Datron stockholders accept the exchange offer and tender their shares in the
exchange offer, you should be aware that some Datron officers and directors may
have interests in the transaction that may be different from, or in addition to,
their interests as stockholders of Datron. See the section entitled "THE
TRANSACTION--INTERESTS OF DATRON'S OFFICERS AND DIRECTORS IN THE TRANSACTION" on
page 56 of this prospectus, as well as Datron's Solicitation/Recommendation
Statement on Schedule 14D-9, which is being mailed to you together with this
prospectus.

ASSUMPTION OF DATRON STOCK OPTIONS AND ESPP PURCHASE RIGHTS BY TITAN (PAGE 72)

    Titan has agreed that at the time it accepts shares of Datron common stock
for payment in the exchange offer Titan will assume all outstanding options to
purchase Datron common stock and all outstanding purchase rights under Datron's
Employee Stock Purchase Plan. As a result, at the time when Titan accepts for
payment shares of Datron common stock in the exchange offer, all outstanding
options and all outstanding purchase rights of Datron under its Employee Stock
Purchase Plan will become exercisable solely for shares of Titan common stock.

LIMITATION ON DATRON'S ABILITY TO CONSIDER OTHER ACQUISITION PROPOSALS
  (PAGE 75)

    Datron has agreed not to solicit, initiate, encourage or discuss any
proposal for a business combination or other similar transaction involving the
acquisition or purchase of (1) more than 20% of any class of voting securities
of Datron or any of its subsidiaries or (2) businesses or assets that account
for 20% or more of Datron's consolidated net revenues, net income or assets, or
the liquidation or dissolution of Datron or any of its subsidiaries, prior to
completion of the merger unless the other party has made an unsolicited written
proposal to Datron for a transaction which Datron's board of directors believes
in good faith, after consultation with Datron's financial advisor, is reasonably
likely to be consummated and would, if consummated, be more favorable to
Datron's stockholders than the transaction, and a number of other conditions are
satisfied.

TERMINATION OF THE MERGER AGREEMENT (PAGE 80)

    Titan and Datron can terminate the merger agreement under certain
circumstances, including if the exchange offer is not consummated by August 31,
2001.

TERMINATION FEE (PAGE 83)

    The merger agreement requires Datron to pay Titan a termination fee equal to
$2.0 million in cash as well as expenses not to exceed $300,000 if the merger
agreement is terminated under certain circumstances.

MATERIAL FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSEQUENCES (PAGE 58)

    Titan and Datron believe that the transaction will qualify as a tax-free
reorganization for U.S. federal income tax purposes, if: (1) the transaction is
completed under the current terms of the merger agreement; (2) the minimum
tender condition to the exchange offer is satisfied; and (3) the merger is
completed promptly after the exchange offer. Based on these assumptions, your
receipt of Titan common stock in the transaction will be tax-free for U.S.
federal income tax purposes (except for taxes, if any, resulting from the
receipt of cash instead of fractional shares of Titan common stock).

    The above described tax treatment of the exchange offer and the merger to
Datron stockholders depends on, among other things, some facts that will not be
known before the completion of the merger. Datron stockholders are urged to
carefully read the discussion in the section entitled "THE TRANSACTION--MATERIAL
FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSEQUENCES" beginning on page 58 of this prospectus. That
discussion includes a summary of the U.S. federal income tax consequences of
participation in the exchange offer and the merger in the event that the
assumptions described above are not satisfied.

    TAX MATTERS CAN BE COMPLICATED, AND THE TAX CONSEQUENCES OF THE EXCHANGE
OFFER AND THE MERGER TO YOU WILL DEPEND ON THE FACTS OF YOUR OWN SITUATION. YOU
SHOULD CONSULT YOUR OWN TAX ADVISOR TO FULLY UNDERSTAND THE TAX CONSEQUENCES OF
THE EXCHANGE OFFER AND THE MERGER TO YOU.

ACCOUNTING TREATMENT (PAGE 61)

    Titan will account for the merger as a purchase for financial reporting
purposes.

APPRAISAL RIGHTS (PAGE 63)

    Datron stockholders are not entitled to appraisal rights in connection with
the exchange offer. If, after completion of the exchange offer, as it may be
extended and including any subsequent offering period, Titan owns a majority but
less than 90% of the outstanding shares of Datron common stock, Titan has agreed
to effect a long-form merger as permitted under Delaware law, which would
require notice to and approval of Datron stockholders. Datron stockholders who
have not exchanged their shares of Datron common stock in the exchange offer
would not have appraisal rights in connection with a long-form merger. However,
if a long-form merger is consummated, and if, on the date fixed to determine
stockholders entitled to vote on the merger, the shares of Datron common stock
are (i) not listed on a national securities exchange or quoted through the
Nasdaq National Market or (ii) held of record by less than 2,000 holders, you
will have appraisal rights pursuant to the provisions of Section 262 of the
Delaware General Corporation Law.

    If, however, after completion of the exchange offer, as it may be extended
and including any subsequent offering period, Titan owns 90% or more of the
outstanding shares of Datron common stock, Titan has agreed to effect a
short-form merger as permitted under Delaware law. In the event that Titan
completes the transaction through a short-form merger, stockholders who did not
tender, or who tendered and withdrew, their shares of Datron common stock in the
exchange offer would have the right under Delaware law to demand appraisal of
their shares of Datron common stock, but only if they comply with certain
statutory requirements. Stockholders who comply with the applicable statutory
procedures will be entitled to receive a judicial determination of the fair
value of their shares of Datron common stock (exclusive of any elements of value
arising from the accomplishment or expectation of the merger) and to receive
payment of this fair value in cash, together with a fair rate of interest, if
any. In the event of a short-form merger, information regarding these
requirements will be provided to Datron stockholders who have not exchanged
their shares of Datron common stock in the exchange offer.

REGULATORY APPROVALS (PAGE 62)

    Titan and Datron have determined that no filing of a notification under the
Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act is required in connection with the
exchange offer or the merger. Completion of the exchange offer may be subject to
compliance with a limited number of foreign antitrust regulations. Any required
notifications by any foreign jurisdiction will be filed in due course.

RECENT DEVELOPMENTS

    Titan recently filed a Form S-3 registration statement with the Securities
and Exchange Commission to register 8,048,685 shares of Titan common stock that
Titan may issue to the public, which amount includes the underwriters'
overallotment option. Titan stockholders also included 576,315 shares of Titan
common stock on the Form S-3 registration statement that those stockholders may
sell to the public. On July 26, 2001, Titan announced a public offering of
7,500,000 of the registered shares, which amount includes the 576,315 registered
shares of Titan stockholders, at a public offering price of $18 per share. Titan
may sell an additional 1,125,000 registered shares to the public if the
underwriters exercise their overallotment option, which had not occurred as of
July 26, 2001. Titan expects the offering to close on July 31, 2001, subject to
the satisfaction of customary closing conditions. To the extent that Titan
issues the shares of Titan common stock referred to above, your fully diluted
equity interest in Titan, based on the number of shares of Titan common stock
you receive in exchange for your Datron common shares pursuant to the exchange
offer and the merger, will be proportionately reduced.

    3,472 stockholders of record.

(2) According to Datron, there were, as of July 30, 2001, approximately

COMPARATIVE MARKET PRICE INFORMATION

    The following table presents:

    - the closing sale price of Titan's common stock, as reported on the New
      York Stock Exchange Composite Tape;

    - the closing sale price of Datron's common stock, as reported on the Nasdaq
      National Market; and

    - the market value based on the closing sale price on the dates specified
      below of the shares of Titan common stock to be received in exchange for
      one share of Datron common stock in the offer;

in each case as if the exchange ratio had been determined on June 22, 2001, the
last full trading day prior to the public announcement of the proposed
transaction, and on July 30, 2001, the last day for which such information could
be practicably calculated prior to the date of this prospectus. The numbers have
been calculated assuming that, (1) as of June 22, 2001, the Datron common stock
value would have been $16.00, the average closing price of Titan common stock
would have been $20.80 and the exchange ratio would have been 0.76923 and
(2) as of July 30, 2001, the Datron common stock value would have been
approximately $16.01, the average closing price of Titan common stock was
$19.544 and the exchange ratio was 0.81919. The assumed Datron common stock
value as of July 30, 2001 is based on the quotient obtained by dividing
$51,226,912 by 3,199,622, the total number of shares of Datron common stock
outstanding as of, or issuable upon the exercise of stock options or other
rights to acquire shares of Datron common stock outstanding as of, July 30,
2001. The actual value of

the Titan common shares a Datron stockholder will receive in the transaction may
be higher or lower than the price set forth below.

                                                                   EQUIVALENT

(1) Computed as the product of the closing price for Titan common stock on the
    dates indicated above multiplied by the assumed exchange ratios for those
    dates as set forth above.

BECAUSE THE EXCHANGE RATIO IS BASED IN PART ON THE AVERAGE CLOSING SALES PRICES
OF TITAN COMMON STOCK FOR THE 10 TRADING DAYS ENDING ON JULY 27, 2001, WE URGE
HOLDERS OF DATRON COMMON STOCK TO CALCULATE THE AVERAGE CLOSING SALES PRICES OF
TITAN COMMON STOCK BY OBTAINING CURRENT MARKET QUOTATIONS BEFORE MAKING ANY
DECISION WITH RESPECT TO THE EXCHANGE OFFER. ON JULY 27, 2001, TITAN FIXED THE
TITAN COMMON STOCK PRICE FOR USE IN COMPUTING THE EXCHANGE RATIO. THE EXACT
EXCHANGE RATIO WILL BE CALCULATED BASED UPON $19.544, THE AVERAGE CLOSING SALES
PRICE FOR SHARES OF TITAN COMMON STOCK DURING THE 10-DAY TRADING PERIOD ENDING
ON JULY 27, 2001.

- ------------------------

(1) Titan income information for its latest fiscal year is for the year ended
    December 31, 2000. Datron income information for its latest fiscal year is
    for the year ended March 31, 2001. The pro forma combined data for the
    latest fiscal year combines Titan's historical data for the year ended
    December 31, 2000 with Datron's historical data for the year ended
    March 31, 2001. The pro forma combined data for the three months ended
    March 31, 2001 combines Titan and Datron's historical data for the three
    months ended March 31, 2001.

(2) The historical book value per share is computed by dividing stockholders'
    equity by the number of shares of common stock and equivalents outstanding
    at the end of each period. The pro forma book value per share is computed by
    dividing pro forma stockholders' equity by the pro forma number of shares of
    common stock and equivalents outstanding at the end of each period.

(3) The pro forma net loss per Titan share is computed by combining the net
    income (loss) for Titan and Datron and any pro forma adjustments and
    dividing the sum by the pro forma number of shares of common stock and
    equivalents outstanding at the end of the period. The pro forma

    shares are computed based upon an assumed Titan average closing price of
    $20.00 per share and a Datron common stock value of $16.00, or an
    approximate .80000 exchange ratio.

(4) The amounts for equivalent pro forma combined per Datron share are
    calculated by multiplying the amounts for pro forma combined per Titan share
    by an assumed exchange ratio of .80000. The exchange ratio assumes a Titan
    average closing price of $20.00 per share, and a Datron common stock value
    of $16.00 based on the total diluted Datron shares and options as of
    June 24, 2001.

                                  RISK FACTORS

    YOU SHOULD CONSIDER THE FOLLOWING MATTERS IN DECIDING WHETHER TO TENDER YOUR
SHARES OF DATRON COMMON STOCK IN THE EXCHANGE OFFER. YOU SHOULD CONSIDER THESE
MATTERS IN CONNECTION WITH THE OTHER INFORMATION THAT TITAN HAS INCLUDED OR
INCORPORATED BY REFERENCE INTO THIS PROSPECTUS.

RISKS RELATED TO THE TRANSACTION

THE SHARES OF TITAN COMMON STOCK TO BE RECEIVED BY DATRON STOCKHOLDERS IN THE
TRANSACTION MAY DECREASE IN VALUE AFTER THE EXCHANGE RATIO IS FIXED.

    The exchange ratio is a fraction equal to the quotient of the Datron common
stock value, divided by the price of Titan common stock. The Datron common stock
value will be determined by dividing $51,226,912 by the number of shares of
Datron common stock outstanding as of, or issuable upon the exercise of stock
options or other rights to acquire shares of Datron common stock outstanding as
of, the date that shares of Datron common stock are accepted for payment
pursuant to the exchange offer. In determining the exchange ratio, the price of
Titan common stock will be computed based on the average closing sales prices
for shares of Titan common stock during the 10 trading day period ending on
July 27, 2001. On July 27, 2001, Titan fixed the Titan common stock price for
use in computing the exchange ratio. The exact exchange ratio will be calculated
based upon $19.544, the average closing sales price for shares of Titan common
stock during the 10-day trading period ending on July 27, 2001.

    After the exchange ratio is fixed, the number of shares that Datron
stockholders will receive in the transaction will not change, even if the market
price of Titan common stock changes. There will be no adjustment to the exchange
ratio or right to terminate the merger agreement, the exchange offer or the
merger based solely on fluctuations in the price of Titan common stock after the
exchange ratio has been fixed. In recent years, the stock market has experienced
extreme price and volume fluctuations. These market fluctuations may adversely
affect the market price of Titan common stock. The market price of Titan common
stock upon and after completion of the exchange offer or the merger could be
lower than the market price on the date of the merger agreement or the current
market price. You should obtain recent market quotations of Titan common stock
before you tender your shares.

FAILURE TO RETAIN KEY EMPLOYEES COULD DIMINISH THE BENEFITS OF THE TRANSACTION.

    The successful combination of Titan and Datron will depend in part on the
retention of key personnel. There can be no assurance that Titan will be able to
retain Datron's key management, technical and marketing personnel, or that Titan
will realize the anticipated benefits of the transaction.

IF TITAN AND DATRON ARE NOT SUCCESSFUL IN INTEGRATING THEIR ORGANIZATIONS, THE
ANTICIPATED BENEFITS OF THE TRANSACTION MAY NOT BE REALIZED.

    If Titan and the stockholders of the combined company are to realize the
anticipated benefits of the transaction, the operations of Titan and Datron must
be integrated and combined efficiently. Titan cannot assure you that the
integration will be successful or that the anticipated benefits of the merger
will be fully realized. Similarly, Titan cannot guarantee that the Datron
stockholders will achieve greater value through their ownership of Titan common
stock than they would have achieved as stockholders of Datron as a separate
entity. The dedication of Titan's management resources to integration activities
may detract attention from the day-to-day business of the combined company. The
difficulties of integration may be increased by the need to integrate personnel
with disparate business backgrounds and combine different corporate cultures.
This integration may also be more difficult due to Titan's integration
challenges as a result of its recently completed acquisitions or any future
acquisitions. Titan cannot assure you that there will not be substantial costs
associated with the integration process, that integration activities will not
result in a decrease in revenues or a decrease in

the value of Titan common stock, or that there will not be other material
adverse effects from Titan's integration efforts.

    In addition, after the transaction, Titan intends to develop new products
that combine Datron's assets with Titan's assets. This may result in longer
product implementations, which may cause Datron's revenue and operating income
and the revenue and operating income of Titan's businesses that are
collaborating with Datron to fluctuate and fail to meet expectations. To date,
Titan has not completed its investigation into the challenges--technological,
market-driven or otherwise--to developing and marketing these new products in a
timely and efficient way. There can be no assurance that Titan and Datron will
be able to overcome these challenges, or that a market for such new products
will develop after the transaction.

SALES OF SUBSTANTIAL AMOUNTS OF TITAN'S COMMON STOCK IN THE OPEN MARKET BY
DATRON STOCKHOLDERS COULD DEPRESS TITAN'S STOCK PRICE.

    Other than shares held by affiliates of Datron or Titan, shares of Titan's
common stock that are issued to stockholders of Datron, including those shares
issued upon the exercise of options and employee stock purchase rights, will be
freely tradable without restrictions or further registration under the
Securities Act. If the exchange offer and subsequent merger with Datron closes
and if Datron stockholders sell substantial amounts of Titan common stock in the
public market following the transaction, including shares issued upon the
exercise of outstanding options to purchase our common stock by Datron
optionholders and employee stock purchase rights, the market price of Titan
common stock could fall. These sales might also make it more difficult for Titan
to sell equity or equity-related securities at a time and price that it
otherwise would deem appropriate. The number of shares of Titan common stock
that will be issued in the transaction will be based in part on the average
closing sales price for shares of Titan common stock during the 10-day trading
period ending on July 27, 2001. Based on a Titan average closing price per share
of $19.544, the average closing sales price for shares of Titan common stock
during the 10-day trading period ending on July 27, 2001, and a Datron common
stock value of approximately $16.01, Titan will issue approximately
2,259,536 shares of Titan common stock in the transaction. In addition, Titan
will assume all outstanding options to purchase Datron common stock and all
employee stock purchase rights, which will be converted into options and rights
to acquire approximately 362,472 shares of Titan common stock using the same
exchange ratio which is applicable to Datron common stock in the transaction.

THE RECEIPT OF SHARES OF TITAN COMMON STOCK COULD BE TAXABLE TO YOU, DEPENDING
ON FACTS SURROUNDING THE TRANSACTION.

    Titan and Datron have structured the transaction to qualify as a tax-free
reorganization for federal income tax purposes. As a condition to the completion
of the exchange offer, Titan and Datron are required to obtain opinions of
Cooley Godward LLP and Heller Ehrman White & McAuliffe LLP, respectively, that
the transaction will be treated for federal income tax purposes as a
reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code
of 1986, also referred to as the "Code," if: (1) the transaction is completed
under the current terms of the merger agreement; (2) the minimum tender
condition for the exchange offer is satisfied; and (3) the merger is completed
promptly after the exchange offer. However, the ability to satisfy these factual
assumptions, and therefore the federal income tax consequences of the
transaction, depends in part on facts that will not be available before the
completion of the transaction. If these factual assumptions are not satisfied, a
Datron stockholder's exchange of shares of Datron common stock for shares of
Titan common stock in the exchange offer or the merger could be a taxable
transaction.

RISKS RELATED TO TITAN'S BUSINESS

TITAN'S GROWTH DEPENDS TO A LARGE EXTENT ON THE GROWTH OF ITS COMMERCIAL
BUSINESSES, SOME OF WHICH OPERATE IN NEW AND UNPROVEN MARKETS. IF ONE OR MORE OF
TITAN'S COMMERCIAL BUSINESSES FAIL TO GAIN MARKET ACCEPTANCE OR ACHIEVE
ANTICIPATED REVENUE LEVELS, TITAN MAY NOT BE ABLE TO RECOUP ITS INVESTMENTS IN
OR ADVANCES TO THESE BUSINESSES, ACHIEVE ITS OBJECTIVE OF MONETIZING THESE
BUSINESSES OR ACHIEVE THE OPERATING RESULTS THAT TITAN ANTICIPATES.

    Titan is committed to creating, building and launching technology-based
commercial businesses. As part of implementing this strategy, Titan has
developed the technology-based businesses known as SureBeam, Titan Wireless and
Cayenta, and is in the process of developing and commercializing the technology
applications and businesses in Titan's Emerging Technologies and Businesses
segment. If any of the primary markets targeted by SureBeam or Titan Wireless
fail to develop and grow as Titan anticipates, or those markets do develop and
grow as anticipated but SureBeam's, Titan Wireless's and/ or Cayenta's principal
products and services do not gain market acceptance, Titan's revenues will be
less than Titan expects and Titan may be unable to recoup the equity investments
and intercompany advances Titan has made to develop and grow those businesses.
To grow as currently contemplated, Titan will need to derive an increasing
portion of its revenues from its commercial businesses, including the businesses
in Titan's Emerging Technologies and Businesses segment. If the markets for some
or all of the businesses in Titan's Emerging Technologies and Businesses segment
fail to develop and grow as expected, or those markets do develop and grow as
expected but those businesses' principal products and services do not meet with
market acceptance, Titan's future prospects may suffer. If any of Titan's
businesses fail to grow as Titan anticipates, it may not be able to monetize
these businesses and enable its stockholders to realize value from that process.

SUREBEAM

    SureBeam faces the challenges associated with the risks of a new enterprise
and the commercialization of a technology with an unproven market. The use of
SureBeam's electron beam technology for food irradiation and the market for
electronically irradiated food is at an early stage of development. As of
March 31, 2001, six food processors were selling food electronically irradiated
by SureBeam. Other food processors are testing SureBeam's technology. Titan also
does not know whether or when any fast food or other national chain restaurants
or food retailers will decide to offer irradiated meat and create demand for
SureBeam's electronic food irradiation systems. Titan expects that some food
processors will not irradiate food unless industry leaders first commit to
distribute irradiated food. Market acceptance of SureBeam's technology will also
depend on consumer acceptance of irradiated food. Accordingly, a market for
irradiated foods has only recently begun to develop, and its continued
development will depend on broad acceptance of irradiated foods by consumers,
food producers and providers, restaurant chains and food retailers. This
consumer and market acceptance may not occur.

TITAN WIRELESS

    Titan Wireless's principal strategy is to provide communications services
and systems to developing countries primarily in Asia, Africa, the Middle East
and Latin America. Titan Wireless's future success will depend substantially on
the rate and the extent to which the markets for communications services and
systems develop in the developing countries that it targets. Titan cannot
guarantee that substantial markets for communications services and systems in
these developing countries will ever develop, or if those markets do develop,
that communications services based on fixed-site satellite technology, wireless
local loop technology, or global systems for mobile communications technology,
all of which Titan Wireless can provide, will capture a significant portion of
those markets. The development of a market for communications services and
systems in a particular developing country will depend upon a variety of factors
including whether that country has sufficient resources to support such a market
and

whether the communications services and systems are offered at an affordable
cost to their end users so that adequate traffic can be generated. Titan
Wireless's success will also depend to a significant extent on its continued
ability to identify and enter into strategic relationships with effective local
partners to act as Titan Wireless's intermediaries with local regulators and
experts in the local market. If Titan Wireless is unable to continue to
cultivate and maintain these relationships, its overall business will suffer.

CAYENTA

    Cayenta's market is characterized by fluctuating demand for its products and
services based on overall economic conditions and their impact on government and
corporate information technology budgets as well as changes in user sentiment
toward particular technologies, technology applications and related services.
Cayenta's operating results for the three months ended March 31, 2001 were
adversely affected by a slowdown in corporate spending on commercial information
technology services and e-business software applications. Cayenta's market is
also intensely competitive. Cayenta's competitors include numerous companies
across various segments of the information technology services and software
products markets. Existing or future competitors may independently develop and
patent or copyright technologies that are superior or substantially similar to
Cayenta's technologies. The costs to develop and to provide information
technology services are relatively low. Moreover, barriers to entry,
particularly in the areas of information technology consulting and integrating
software applications, are low. Therefore, Cayenta will likely continue to face
additional competition from new entrants into its market. If overall economic
conditions continue to weaken demand for Cayenta's products and services, or if
Cayenta is unable to anticipate and respond effectively to changing market
conditions or to compete effectively for any reason, its business will suffer.

EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES AND BUSINESSES

    The businesses in Titan's Emerging Technologies and Businesses segment face
the ongoing challenges of developing technology applications that anticipate and
satisfy consumers' requirements and achieving market acceptance for those
technology applications in new and rapidly changing markets. To the extent these
businesses fail to effectively meet either of those challenges, Titan's ability
to execute its monetizing strategy and provide increased value to Titan's
stockholders will be diminished.

TITAN HAS A LIMITED HISTORY OF COMMERCIALIZING NEW TECHNOLOGIES AND TITAN'S
COMMERCIAL BUSINESSES MAY NOT REMAIN OR EVER BECOME SUCCESSFUL.

    In 1991, Titan adopted a strategy of seeking to develop commercial
businesses using technology developed for government purposes in Titan's
government defense business. Titan's SureBeam and Titan Wireless businesses are
a product of this strategy. For the most part, Titan's commercial businesses are
in an early stage of development or have only recently begun to offer their
products, services, systems or solutions in the markets, including new markets,
in which they operate. These technology-based businesses are subject to risks
and uncertainties inherent in companies at these early stages of development,
including:

    - the risks that their base technology will become obsolete and that they
      will fail to respond in a timely and cost-effective manner to rapid
      technological changes;

    - the risks associated with operating in markets that are subject to a high
      degree of competition;

    - the risk that they will have inadequate management resources to capitalize
      on market opportunities and execute their strategy;

    - the risk that they will be unable to manage rapid growth effectively;

    - the risk that they will be unable to execute successfully each portion of
      their business strategy on schedule;

    - the risk that Titan may not identify markets with sufficient opportunities
      to justify Titan's investments in products and solutions for these
      markets;

    - the market and operating risks that are unique to each particular
      business; and

    - the risk that adequate capital may not be available to fund their
      continued development.

    Titan balances its investment objectives for each of its businesses with
Titan's overall profitability objectives. This balancing is a basic part of
Titan's approach to creating and building new commercial businesses and creates
the possibility that any or all of Titan's businesses may not grow at the pace
or to the level that they otherwise might if they were independent companies.
These factors, including the risks identified above, could affect Titan's
ability to monetize its investments in its businesses or diminish the value that
Titan's stockholders ultimately recognize from those investments.

TITAN MAY MAKE EQUITY INVESTMENTS OR INTERCOMPANY ADVANCES TO SOME OF ITS
BUSINESSES WHICH TITAN COULD LOSE OR HAVE TO WRITE OFF.

    Titan has historically funded businesses in its Emerging Technologies and
Businesses segment, as well as its other businesses, with equity investments
and/or intercompany advances, and expects to continue to do so in the future. At
the time Titan makes these investments or advances, these businesses are
typically at an early stage of development. If these businesses do not become
profitable or Titan is unable to monetize its investments in them, Titan could
lose all or a portion of its equity in those businesses and be required to write
off some or all of any amounts advanced.

TITAN'S COMMERCIAL BUSINESSES' GROWTH MAY BE IMPAIRED BECAUSE OF INVESTMENT OR
FUNDING CHOICES TITAN MAKES OR BECAUSE TITAN IS UNABLE TO GENERATE SUFFICIENT
CASH FLOW OR TO ACCESS CAPITAL FROM EXTERNAL SOURCES.

    Titan typically funds its businesses' growth with equity investments,
intercompany advances and/or public or private financing. Titan may choose not
to fund potential growth opportunities for its businesses with equity
investments or intercompany advances based on risk considerations or Titan's
balancing of its investment objectives for those businesses with its overall
profitability objectives. In addition, Titan may be unable to fund potential
growth opportunities for its businesses to the extent that Titan Systems does
not generate sufficient cash flow for Titan to do so or Titan does not otherwise
have capital on hand and/or cannot access adequate capital. Titan may also be
precluded from funding potential growth opportunities for its commercial
businesses with public or private financing based on market conditions. To the
extent that Titan is unable to, or chooses not to, provide capital to its
commercial businesses to fund potential growth opportunities, Titan's commercial
businesses' growth could be impaired.

MARKET CONDITIONS AND LEGAL AND CONTRACTUAL RESTRICTIONS MAY IMPAIR TITAN'S
ABILITY TO MONETIZE ITS INVESTMENTS IN ITS COMMERCIAL TECHNOLOGY APPLICATIONS
AND BUSINESSES.

    Titan cannot guarantee that it will be able to monetize any of its
investments in its commercial technology applications or businesses, whether
through an initial public offering of a subsidiary, a complete spin-off to Titan
stockholders, an outright sale of a subsidiary, or a technology license or sale.
Market or competitive conditions may be such that Titan is unable to complete
initial public offerings of its subsidiaries or spin-offs of its subsidiaries to
Titan's stockholders at valuations that Titan considers appropriate, in which
case Titan may choose to delay or forego initial public offerings or spin-offs
of these subsidiaries. Based on market or competitive conditions, Titan may also
be unable to sell or license its commercial technology applications or sell its
businesses at valuations or for other consideration Titan considers appropriate,
in which case Titan may choose to delay or forego those

sales or licenses. To the extent possible, Titan intends to structure any
initial public offerings that its subsidiaries conduct in a manner to preserve
the ability to later distribute the stock Titan retains in the subsidiaries to
its stockholders on a tax-free basis. Under current law, there are a number of
tax and other legal requirements that must be satisfied in order to successfully
execute this strategy and Titan cannot guarantee that they will be met.
Contractual restrictions may also restrict Titan's ability to successfully
execute this strategy. With the exception of SureBeam and Cayenta, Titan's
credit facility does not permit Titan's subsidiaries to conduct initial public
offerings or, with the exception of Cayenta, allow Titan to distribute the stock
of its subsidiaries to Titan stockholders without the consent of the lenders.
Titan may distribute the stock of Cayenta to Titan stockholders without the
consent of the lenders so long as Titan is in compliance with financial ratios
specified in, and not otherwise in default under, its credit facility.

TITAN DEPENDS ON GOVERNMENT CONTRACTS FOR A SUBSTANTIAL MAJORITY OF ITS REVENUES
AND THE LOSS OF GOVERNMENT CONTRACTS OR A DECLINE IN FUNDING OF EXISTING OR
FUTURE GOVERNMENT CONTRACTS COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT TITAN'S REVENUES AND CASH
FLOWS AND TITAN'S ABILITY TO FUND ITS COMMERCIAL BUSINESSES.

    Titan's revenues from U.S. government business represented approximately 85%
of Titan's total revenues in 1998, approximately 84% of Titan's total revenues
in 1999, approximately 74% of Titan's total revenues in 2000, and approximately
80% of Titan's total revenues for the three months ended March 31, 2001. Titan's
U.S. government contracts are only funded on an annual basis, and the U.S.
government may cancel these contracts at any time without penalty or may change
its requirements, programs or contract budget or decline to exercise option
periods, any of which could reduce Titan's revenues and cash flows from U.S.
government contracts. Titan's revenues and cash flows from U.S. government
contracts could also be reduced by declines in U.S. defense and other federal
agency budgets.

    A significant percentage of Titan's products and services are predominantly
sold and performed under contracts with various parts of the U.S. Navy or U.S.
Air Force or with prime contractors to the U.S. Navy or U.S. Air Force. Although
these various parts of the U.S. Navy or U.S. Air Force are subject to common
budgetary pressures and other factors, Titan's various U.S. Navy and U.S. Air
Force customers exercise independent purchasing decisions. However, because of
such concentration of Titan's contracts, Titan is vulnerable to adverse changes
in its revenues and cash flows if a significant number of Titan's U.S. Navy or
U.S. Air Force contracts and subcontracts are simultaneously delayed or canceled
for budgetary or other reasons.

    In addition to contract cancellations and declines in agency budgets, Titan
may be adversely affected by:

    - budgetary constraints affecting U.S. government spending generally, and
      changes in fiscal policy;

    - curtailment of the U.S government's use of technology services and
      products providers;

    - the adoption of new laws or regulations;

    - technological developments;

    - U.S. government shutdowns, such as that which occurred during the U.S.
      government's 1996 fiscal year; and

    - general economic conditions.

    These or other factors could cause U.S. defense and other federal agencies
to reduce their purchases under contracts, to exercise their right to terminate
contracts or not to exercise options to renew contracts. Any of these actions or
any of the other actions described above could reduce Titan's revenues and cash
flows and impair Titan's ability to make equity investments in or intercompany
advances to its commercial subsidiaries as part of its approach to creating and
building new businesses.

GOVERNMENT AUDITS OF TITAN'S GOVERNMENT CONTRACTS COULD RESULT IN A MATERIAL
CHANGE TO TITAN'S EARNINGS AND HAVE A NEGATIVE EFFECT ON TITAN'S CASH POSITION.

    Titan's government contracts are subject to cost audits by the government.
These audits may occur several years after completion of the audited work. Titan
could have a material charge to its earnings or reduction in its cash position
as a result of an audit, including an audit of one of the companies Titan has
acquired. Some of Titan's acquired companies did not historically impose
internal controls as rigorous as those Titan imposes on the government contracts
it performs, which may increase the likelihood that an audit of their government
contracts could cause a charge to Titan's earnings or reduction in its cash
position.

TITAN'S OPERATING MARGINS MAY DECLINE UNDER ITS FIXED-PRICE CONTRACTS IF TITAN
FAILS TO ESTIMATE ACCURATELY THE TIME AND RESOURCES NECESSARY TO SATISFY TITAN'S
OBLIGATIONS.

    Some of Titan's contracts are fixed-price contracts under which Titan bears
the risk of any cost overruns. Titan's profits are adversely affected if its
costs under these contracts exceed the assumptions Titan used in bidding for the
contract. In 2000, approximately 32% of Titan's revenues were derived from
fixed-price contracts, and in the three months ended March 31, 2001
approximately 24% of Titan's revenues were derived from fixed-price contracts.
Often, Titan is required to fix the price for a contract before Titan finalizes
the project specifications, which increases the risk that Titan will misprice
these contracts. The complexity of many of Titan's engagements makes accurately
estimating Titan's time and resources more difficult.

IF TITAN IS NOT ABLE TO RETAIN ITS CONTRACTS WITH THE U.S. GOVERNMENT AND
SUBCONTRACTS UNDER U.S. GOVERNMENT PRIME CONTRACTS IN THE COMPETITIVE REBIDDING
PROCESS, TITAN'S REVENUES MAY SUFFER.

    Upon expiration of a U.S. government contract or subcontract under a U.S.
government prime contract, if the government customer requires further services
of the type provided in the contract, there is frequently a competitive
rebidding process. Titan cannot guarantee that Titan, or the prime contractor,
will win any particular bid, or that Titan will be able to replace business lost
upon expiration or completion of a contract. Further, all U.S. government
contracts are subject to protest by competitors. The termination of several of
Titan's significant contracts or nonrenewal of several of Titan's significant
contracts, the imposition of fines or damages, or Titan's suspension or
debarment from bidding on additional contracts could result in significant
revenue shortfalls.

TITAN MAY BE LIABLE FOR PENALTIES UNDER A VARIETY OF PROCUREMENT RULES AND
REGULATIONS, AND CHANGES IN GOVERNMENT REGULATIONS COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT
TITAN'S BUSINESS.

    Titan's defense and commercial businesses must comply with and are affected
by various government regulations. Among the most significant regulations are
the following:

    - the U.S. Federal Acquisition Regulations, which comprehensively regulate
      the formation, administration and performance of government contracts;

    - the U.S. Truth in Negotiations Act, which requires certification and
      disclosure of all cost and pricing data in connection with contract
      negotiations;

    - the U.S. Cost Accounting Standards, which impose accounting requirements
      that govern Titan's right to reimbursement under certain cost-based
      government contracts;

    - laws, regulations and Executive Orders restricting the use and
      dissemination of information classified for national security purposes and
      the exportation of certain products and technical data;

    - the U.S. Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, which regulates SureBeam's
      technology as a food additive and is administered by the U.S. Food and
      Drug Administration;

    - regulations relating to using the SureBeam system, including product
      labeling, administered by the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Food Safety
      and Inspection Service and by health and environmental safety departments
      and other regulatory agencies within various states and foreign countries;
      and

    - laws and regulatory requirements relating to satellite communications and
      other wireless communication systems in the developing countries where
      Titan Wireless operates.

    These regulations affect how Titan's customers and Titan do business and, in
some instances, impose added costs on Titan's businesses. Any changes in
applicable laws could adversely affect the financial performance of the business
affected by the changed regulations. With respect to U.S. government contracts,
any failure to comply with applicable laws could result in contract termination,
price or fee reductions or suspension or debarment from contracting with the
U.S. government.

TITAN'S FAILURE TO IDENTIFY, ATTRACT AND RETAIN QUALIFIED TECHNICAL AND
MANAGEMENT PERSONNEL COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT ITS EXISTING BUSINESSES AND ITS
ABILITY TO BUILD ADDITIONAL COMMERCIAL BUSINESSES.

    Titan cannot guarantee that it will be able to attract and retain the highly
qualified technical personnel for each of its segments, including engineers,
computer programmers and personnel with security clearances required for
classified work, that are necessary for maintaining and growing Titan's existing
businesses or building additional commercial businesses. Titan's success also
depends to a significant extent on the continued contributions of Titan's
management personnel for each of its segments. Titan's ability to build
additional commercial businesses in its Emerging Technologies and Businesses
segment will depend in part on Titan's ability to attract management personnel
from outside Titan with relevant market expertise and management skills, and on
Titan's ability to retain and motivate these managers.

TITAN COMPETES IN HIGHLY COMPETITIVE MARKETS AGAINST MANY COMPANIES THAT ARE
LARGER, BETTER FINANCED AND BETTER KNOWN THAN TITAN. IF TITAN IS UNABLE TO
COMPETE EFFECTIVELY, TITAN'S BUSINESS AND PROSPECTS WILL BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED.

    Titan's businesses operate in highly competitive markets. Many of its
competitors are larger, better financed and better known companies who may
compete more effectively than Titan can. Titan's commercial businesses compete
against other technologies as well as against companies with similar products
and services. In order to remain competitive, Titan must invest to keep its
products technically advanced and compete on price and on value added to Titan's
customers. Titan's ability to compete may be adversely affected by limits on
Titan's capital resources and Titan's ability to invest in maintaining and
expanding its market share.

TITAN HAS COMPLETED NUMEROUS STRATEGIC ACQUISITIONS AND MAY COMPLETE OTHERS,
WHICH COULD INCREASE TITAN'S COSTS OR LIABILITIES OR BE DISRUPTIVE.

    Since January 1, 1998, Titan has acquired 13 government information
technology businesses as part of Titan's strategy of consolidating government
information technology businesses. In addition, since January 1, 1999, Titan has
acquired four information technology services and solutions companies as part of
Cayenta's development of its total services provider offering. Several of the
businesses that Titan acquired had themselves acquired other businesses prior to
their acquisition by Titan. The acquisition and integration of new businesses
involves risk. The integration of acquired businesses may

be costly and may result in a decrease in the value of Titan's common stock for
the following reasons, among others:

    - Titan may need to divert more management resources to integration than
      Titan planned, which may adversely affect Titan's ability to pursue other
      more profitable activities;

    - the difficulties of integration may be increased by the necessity of
      coordinating geographically separated organizations, integrating personnel
      with disparate business backgrounds and combining different corporate
      cultures;

    - Titan may not eliminate as many redundant costs as Titan anticipated in
      selecting its acquisition candidates; and

    - one or more of Titan's acquisition candidates also may have liabilities or
      adverse operating issues that Titan failed to discover through its
      diligence prior to the acquisition.

    In addition to the transaction, Titan intends to continue to look for
strategic acquisitions. Titan may not be able to integrate successfully any
acquired businesses without substantial expense, delay or other operational or
financial problems. In addition, instability in the U.S. securities markets and
volatility in Titan's stock price may make acquisitions with Titan's stock more
expensive.

TITAN MAY INCUR SIGNIFICANT COSTS IN PROTECTING TITAN'S INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY
WHICH COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT TITAN'S PROFIT MARGINS. TITAN'S INABILITY TO
PROTECT ITS PATENTS AND PROPRIETARY RIGHTS IN THE U.S. AND FOREIGN COUNTRIES
COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT TITAN'S BUSINESSES' PROSPECTS AND COMPETITIVE POSITIONS.

    As part of Titan's strategy, Titan seeks to protect its proprietary
technology and inventions through patents and other proprietary-right protection
in the U.S. and other countries. The laws of some foreign countries do not
protect proprietary rights to the same extent as the laws of the U.S. If Titan
is unable to obtain or maintain these protections, Titan may not be able to
prevent third parties from using its proprietary rights. In addition, Titan may
incur significant expense both in protecting its intellectual property and in
defending or assessing claims with respect to intellectual property owned by
others.

    Titan assesses the strength of its patent and intellectual property
protection for its technologies and products. Despite Titan's assessments and
Titan's belief in the strength of its patent protection for particular
technologies or products, Titan's patents may not provide effective barriers to
entry against competitors in the markets targeted by particular technologies and
products because Titan's competitors may develop competing technologies and
products that do not infringe upon Titan's patents. Titan also could choose to
modify or abandon one or more planned or current products because of these
assessments or actual or threatened claims by other companies. Titan is not
certain that its pending patent applications will be issued.

    Titan also relies on trade secrets, proprietary know-how and continuing
technological innovation to remain competitive. Titan has taken measures to
protect its trade secrets and know-how, including the use of confidentiality
agreements with Titan's employees, consultants and advisors. It is possible that
these agreements may be breached and that any remedies for a breach will not be
sufficient to compensate Titan for damages incurred. Titan generally controls
and limits access to, and the distribution of, its product documentation and
other proprietary information. Titan also cannot guarantee that other parties
will not independently develop Titan's know-how or otherwise obtain access to
Titan's technology.

    On January 6, 2000, Ion Beam Applications s.a., a Belgian corporation, and
its related U.S. subsidiaries filed an action for declaratory judgment in a
federal court in Virginia against Titan and SureBeam relating to SureBeam's
patents for its SureBeam systems. On Titan's motion, the Virginia court
transferred the case to the Federal District Court in San Diego. The action
attacks the validity of

SureBeam's core Irradiation System Utilizing Conveyor Transported
Article Carriers patent, and seeks a declaration that Ion Beam Applications and
its customers have not infringed any of the claims in SureBeam's patent. On
November 29, 2000, Ion Beam filed an amended complaint alleging, in addition to
the original claims, that Titan and SureBeam have engaged in false advertising,
monopolization, restraint on trade, unfair business practices and unfair
competition, and alleging unenforceability due to patent misuse. Titan and
SureBeam have filed a counterclaim against the plaintiffs alleging infringement
of SureBeam's patent for its SureBeam systems. Titan and SureBeam are seeking
damages and an injunction preventing further infringement of SureBeam's patent.
On April 17, 2001 the court granted Titan's motion to try Titan's and SureBeam's
patent infringement claim and Ion Beam Application's claims against SureBeam's
patent separately and before any trial of Ion Beam Application's claims alleging
false advertising, monopolization, restraint on trade and unfair business
practices. Titan and SureBeam intend to vigorously enforce SureBeam's patents
and prosecute their patent infringement claims against the plaintiffs. Titan and
SureBeam also intend to vigorously defend against all allegations made by the
plaintiffs. However, a finding in favor of Ion Beam Applications in this
litigation could adversely affect SureBeam's business, financial condition and
results of operations by allowing Ion Beam and other potential competitors to
develop and commercialize electron beam food irradiation systems that would
compete against SureBeam's systems and services, thereby potentially reducing
the growth of Titan's SureBeam business segment and preventing SureBeam from
generating the revenues that it expects from food irradiation.

RISKS OF TITAN'S INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS, INCLUDING ECONOMIC CONDITIONS IN
OTHER COUNTRIES, COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT THE PROSPECTS OF ITS TITAN WIRELESS,
SUREBEAM AND CAYENTA BUSINESSES.

    Titan's Titan Wireless, SureBeam and Cayenta businesses each operate in
international markets. Through Titan's subsidiary Titan Wireless, Titan sells
communications services and systems primarily in developing countries. Although
Titan currently sells its communications services and systems primarily in U.S.
dollars, currency devaluations and adverse market conditions in developing
countries in the past have and in the future could negatively affect demand for
Titan's communications services and systems and, consequently, Titan's revenues
for this segment. In addition, Titan may in the future bill for its
communications services in local currency. As a result, revenues in this segment
may be adversely affected by economic conditions in developing countries.
SureBeam also intends to increase its sales of its SureBeam systems abroad as
SureBeam obtains regulatory approvals to market and sell those systems in other
countries. Those jurisdictions may apply different criteria from the U.S.
regulatory agencies in connection with their approval processes. Monitoring
changes in, and SureBeam's compliance with, diverse and numerous foreign
regulatory requirements may increase SureBeam's costs. The possibility of such
added costs due to the complexity of maintaining compliance with varied foreign
regulatory requirements is a risk that all of Titan's businesses that operate in
international markets face. To date, Titan does not believe that the
international operations of its existing businesses currently subject it to
material risks from fluctuations in currency exchange rates. However, as Titan
increases the international operations of its businesses, Titan's risks from
fluctuations in currency exchange rates, to the extent Titan bills for its
products in foreign currencies, will increase.

    Selling products or services in international markets also entails other
market, economic, cultural, legal and political risks, conditions and expenses.
These risks include:

    - trade protective measures and import or export licensing requirements or
      other restrictive actions by foreign governments;

    - reduced protection of intellectual property rights;

    - political and economic instability;

    - difficulties in collecting amounts owed to Titan;

    - difficulties in managing overseas employees and contractors; and

    - changes in applicable laws and regulations, including licensing laws, tax
      laws and regulations.

    Any one of these factors or other international business risks could
adversely affect Titan's financial performance.

THE COVENANTS IN TITAN'S CREDIT FACILITY RESTRICT TITAN'S FINANCIAL AND
OPERATIONAL FLEXIBILITY AND TITAN'S FAILURE TO COMPLY WITH THEM COULD HAVE A
MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON TITAN'S BUSINESS.

    Titan's credit facility contains covenants that restrict, among other
things, Titan's ability to borrow money, make particular types of investments,
including investments in Titan's subsidiaries, or other restricted payments,
swap or sell assets, merge or consolidate, or make acquisitions. An event of
default under Titan's credit facility could allow the lenders to declare all
amounts outstanding to be immediately due and payable. Titan has pledged
substantially all of its consolidated assets and the stock of Titan's
subsidiaries to secure the debt under Titan's credit facility, excluding the
assets of SureBeam and any foreign subsidiaries. If the amounts outstanding
under the credit facility were accelerated, the lenders could proceed against
those consolidated assets and the stock of Titan's subsidiaries. Any event of
default, therefore, could have a material adverse effect on Titan's business.
Titan's credit facility also requires Titan to maintain specified financial
ratios. Titan's ability to meet these financial ratios can be affected by events
beyond Titan's control, and Titan cannot assure you that it will meet those
ratios. Titan also may incur future debt obligations that might subject Titan to
restrictive covenants that could affect Titan's financial and operational
flexibility or subject Titan to other events of default. Any such restrictive
covenants in any future debt obligations Titan incurs could limit Titan's
ability to fund its commercial businesses with equity investments or
intercompany advances, which would impede Titan's ability to execute its
approach to creating and building new businesses.

TITAN'S OPERATING RESULTS MAY BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY DISRUPTIONS IN ITS SUPPLY
OF PRODUCTS AND COMPONENTS OR SERVICES.

    Because Titan's internal manufacturing capacity is limited, Titan uses
contract manufacturers. While Titan uses care in selecting its manufacturers,
this arrangement gives Titan less control over the reliability of supply,
quality and price of products or components than if Titan manufactured them. In
some cases, Titan obtains products from a sole supplier or a limited group of
suppliers. For example, SureBeam relies on one supplier for some of the key
components used to manufacture SureBeam's linear accelerator. Consequently,
Titan risks disruptions in its supply of key products and components if Titan's
suppliers fail or are unable to perform because of strikes, natural disasters,
financial condition or other factors. Any material supply disruptions could
adversely affect Titan's business, financial condition and results of operations
as well as Titan's ongoing product cost structure.

TITAN'S BUSINESS IS SUBJECT TO SIGNIFICANT ENVIRONMENTAL REGULATION. COMPLIANCE
COSTS, OR ANY FUTURE VIOLATIONS OR LIABILITY UNDER ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS, COULD
HARM TITAN'S BUSINESS.

    Titan is subject to environmental and safety laws and regulations governing
the use, storage and disposal of hazardous substances or wastes and imposing
liability for the cleanup of contamination from these substances. Titan cannot
completely eliminate the risk of contamination or injury from these substances
or wastes, and, in the event of such an incident, Titan could be held liable for
any damages that result. From time to time, Titan has been notified of
violations of government and environmental regulations. Titan attempts to
correct these violations promptly without any material impact on Titan's
operations. In addition, Titan may be required to incur significant additional
costs to comply with environmental laws and regulations in the future. These
costs, and any future violations or liability under environmental laws or
regulations, could have a material adverse effect on Titan's business.

RISKS RELATED TO TITAN'S COMMON STOCK

TITAN'S RESULTS OF OPERATIONS HAVE HISTORICALLY FLUCTUATED AND MAY CONTINUE TO
FLUCTUATE SIGNIFICANTLY IN THE FUTURE, WHICH COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT THE MARKET
PRICE OF ITS COMMON STOCK.

    Titan's revenues are affected by factors such as the unpredictability of
sales and contracts awards due to the long procurement process for most of its
products and services, defense and intelligence budgets, the time it takes for
the new markets Titan targets to develop and for Titan to develop and provide
products and services for those markets, competition and general economic
conditions. Titan's product mix and unit volume, its ability to keep expenses
within budgets, its distribution channels and its pricing affect its gross
margins. These factors and other risk factors described herein may adversely
affect Titan's results of operations within a period and cause Titan's financial
results to fluctuate significantly on a quarterly or annual basis. Consequently,
Titan does not believe that comparison of its results of operations from period
to period is necessarily meaningful or predictive of its likely future results
of operations. It is possible that in some future quarter or quarters Titan's
operating results will be below the expectations of public market analysts or
investors. If so, the market price of Titan's common stock may decline
significantly.

MARKET PERCEPTION AND PERFORMANCE OF TITAN'S PUBLICLY-TRADED SUBSIDIARY SUREBEAM
COULD HAVE A DISPROPORTIONATE IMPACT ON TITAN'S STOCK PRICE.

    As the parent company of its publicly-traded subsidiary, SureBeam, the
market price of Titan's common stock could be disproportionately impacted by
negative news or other publicity concerning SureBeam, including public concerns
about the safety of irradiated foods, as well as SureBeam's financial
performance and the market price of its common stock.

ANTI-TAKEOVER PROVISIONS IN TITAN'S CERTIFICATE OF INCORPORATION, BYLAWS AND
DELAWARE LAW, AS WELL AS TITAN'S STOCKHOLDER RIGHTS PLAN, COULD DISCOURAGE,
DELAY OR PREVENT A CHANGE OF CONTROL THAT TITAN'S STOCKHOLDERS MAY FAVOR.

    Provisions in Titan's certificate of incorporation, its bylaws and Delaware
law could make it difficult and expensive for a third party to pursue a takeover
attempt Titan opposes even if a change in control of Titan would be beneficial
to the interests of its stockholders. These provisions could discourage
potential takeover attempts and could adversely affect the market price of
Titan's common stock. These provisions:

    - permit Titan's stockholders to take action by written consent instead of
      at a meeting and to nominate directors or bring other business before
      stockholder meetings only if they comply with advance notice and other
      procedural requirements in Titan's bylaws;

    - authorize Titan's board of directors, without stockholder approval, to
      issue up to 2,931,898 shares of "blank check" preferred stock that could
      be issued by its board of directors to increase the number of outstanding
      shares and prevent a takeover attempt; and

    - prohibit Titan from engaging in mergers and other business combinations
      with stockholders that beneficially own 15% or more of its voting stock,
      or with their affiliates, unless Titan's directors or stockholders approve
      the business combination in the prescribed manner.

    In addition to the provisions described above, in 1995 Titan's board of
directors adopted a "poison pill" stockholder rights plan, which may further
discourage a third party from making a proposal to acquire Titan which Titan has
not solicited or does not approve, even if the acquisition would be beneficial
to Titan's stockholders. As a result, Titan's stockholders who wish to
participate in such a transaction may not have an opportunity to do so. Under
Titan's rights plan, preferred share purchase rights, which are attached to
Titan's common stock, generally will be triggered upon the acquisition, or

actions that would result in the acquisition, of 15% or more of Titan's common
stock by any person or group. If triggered, these rights would entitle Titan's
stockholders other than the acquiror to purchase, for the exercise price, shares
of Titan's common stock having a market value of two times the exercise price.
In addition, if a company acquires Titan in a merger or other business
combination not approved by the board of directors, these rights will entitle
Titan's stockholders other than the acquiror to purchase, for the exercise
price, shares of the common stock of the acquiring company having a market value
of two times the exercise price.

THERE MAY BE VOLATILITY IN THE PRICE OF TITAN'S COMMON STOCK.

    Stock prices of many companies in the high technology industry have
experienced wide fluctuations that have often been unrelated to the operating
performance of these companies. The market price of Titan's common stock may
vary widely as a result of several factors, including:

    - announcements of technological innovations or new commercial products by
      Titan or its competitors;

    - budgetary constraints affecting U.S. government spending generally,
      changes in fiscal policy, and government regulatory initiatives;

    - patent or proprietary rights developments;

    - public concern as to the use or safety of one or more of Titan's
      technologies; and

    - general market conditions.

    These factors could lead to a significant decrease in the market price of
Titan's common stock.

                                THE TRANSACTION

GENERAL DESCRIPTION OF THE EXCHANGE OFFER

    On June 24, 2001, Titan entered into a merger agreement with Datron,
providing for a subsidiary of Titan to acquire all of the outstanding shares of
Datron common stock by means of an exchange offer and a subsequent merger.
Datron's board of directors unanimously approved the merger agreement,
determined that the exchange offer and the merger are fair to, and in the best
interests of, Datron stockholders and recommends that Datron stockholders accept
the exchange offer and tender their shares pursuant to the exchange offer.

    Titan, through its wholly-owned subsidiary Gem Acquisition Corp., is
offering to exchange a number of shares of Titan common stock determined
pursuant to an exchange ratio, described below, for each outstanding share of
Datron common stock that is validly tendered and not properly withdrawn.

    If completed, the exchange offer will be followed by a merger of Gem
Acquisition Corp. into Datron in which shares of Datron common stock will be
converted into shares of Titan common stock at the same exchange ratio used in
the exchange offer. After completion of the merger, Datron will be a
wholly-owned subsidiary of Titan.

    The expiration date of the exchange offer is 12:00 midnight, New York City
time, on August 3, 2001, unless Titan extends the period of time for which the
exchange offer is open, in which case the term "expiration date" means the
latest time and date on which the exchange offer, as so extended, expires.

    If you are the record owner of your shares of Datron common stock and you
tender those shares directly to the exchange agent, you will not incur any
brokerage fees or commissions. If you own your shares of Datron common stock
through a broker or other nominee, and your broker tenders those shares on your
behalf, your broker may charge you a commission for doing so. You should consult
with your broker or nominee to determine whether any charges will apply. Titan
will be responsible for any transfer taxes on the exchange of shares of Datron
common stock pursuant to the exchange offer that are imposed on the acquiror of
the shares of Datron common stock. You will be responsible for any transfer
taxes that are imposed on the transferor.

    Titan's obligation to deliver shares of Titan common stock in exchange for
shares of Datron common stock pursuant to the exchange offer is subject to
several conditions referred to below in the section entitled "CERTAIN TERMS OF
THE MERGER AGREEMENT--CONDITIONS TO THE EXCHANGE OFFER."

THE EXCHANGE RATIO

    The exchange ratio is a fraction (rounded to the fifth decimal point)
computed generally as the quotient of the following two items:

    - the numerator is equal to the Datron common stock value, determined by
      dividing $51,226,912 by the number of shares of Datron common stock
      outstanding as of, or issuable upon the exercise of stock options or other
      rights to acquire shares of Datron common stock outstanding as of, the
      date that shares of Datron common stock are accepted for payment pursuant
      to the exchange offer; and

    - the denominator is equal to a number representing the Titan common stock
      price computed based on certain conditions as described below.

    The exact exchange ratio will be computed based on the average closing sales
price for shares of Titan common stock during the 10-day trading period ending
on July 27, 2001 as follows:

    (i) If the average closing sales price of Titan common stock is greater than
        or equal to $17.50 per share and less than $19.00 per share, then the
        exchange ratio will be equal to the Datron common stock value divided by
        $19.00.

    (ii) If the average closing sales price of Titan common stock is greater
         than or equal to $19.00 per share and less than or equal to $26.00 per
         share, then the exchange ratio will be equal to the Datron common stock
         value divided by the average closing sales price of Titan common stock.

   (iii) If the average closing sales price of Titan common stock is greater
         than $26.00 per share and less than or equal to $27.50 per share, then
         the exchange ratio will be equal to the Datron common stock value
         divided by $26.00.

    (iv) If the average closing price of Titan common stock is greater than
         $27.50 per share, then:

       (A) Titan may elect to terminate the offer unless Datron agrees to an
           exchange ratio equal to the product of 1.10 and the Datron common
           stock value divided by the average closing sales price of Titan
           common stock;

        (B) if Titan elects to terminate the offer and Datron does not make the
            election set forth in clause (i) above, then the offer will be
            terminated; or

        (C) if Titan does not elect to terminate the offer, the exchange ratio
            will be equal to the Datron common stock value divided by $26.00.

    (v) If the average closing sales price of Titan common stock is less than
        $17.50 per share, then:

       (A) Datron may elect to terminate the offer unless Titan agrees to an
           exchange ratio equal to the product of 0.90 and the Datron common
           stock value divided by the average closing sales price of Titan
           common stock;

        (B) if Datron elects to terminate the offer and Titan does not make the
            election set forth in clause (i) above, then the offer will be
            terminated; or

        (C) if Datron does not elect to terminate the offer, the exchange ratio
            will be equal to the Datron common stock value divided by $19.00.

    On July 27, 2001, Titan fixed the Titan common stock price for use in
computing the exchange ratio. The exact exchange ratio will be calculated based
upon $19.544, the average closing sales price for shares of Titan common stock
during the 10-day trading period ending on July 27, 2001.

    As of July 30, 2001, the last practicable date prior to the date of this
prospectus, (i) the number of shares of Datron common stock outstanding, or
issuable upon the exercise of stock options or other rights to acquire shares of
Datron common stock, was 3,199,622, and (ii) the Datron common stock value was
approximately $16.01. Pursuant to the terms of the merger agreement, Datron has
agreed not to issue any rights to acquire Datron common stock or any additional
shares of Datron common stock, except issuances of Datron common stock upon
exercise of existing options to purchase Datron common stock or pursuant to the
terms of Datron's existing Employee Stock Purchase Plan. Unless Datron violates
its obligations under the merger agreement, Titan does not expect that the
Datron common stock value will be materially different from the Datron common
stock value as computed on July 30, 2001.

ILLUSTRATIVE TABLE OF EXCHANGE RATIOS AND VALUE OF OFFER/MERGER CONSIDERATION

    The columns in the following table present:

    - illustrative values of the exchange ratios that would result if the Titan
      average closing price were within a range of $17.50 and $27.50 per share;

    - the fraction of a share of Titan common stock that would be issued for one
      share of Datron common stock at each of the Titan average closing prices
      presented in the table; and

    - the illustrative values of the approximate consideration that would be
      issued in connection with the offer and the merger for one Datron common
      share, which illustrative values are determined by multiplying each of the
      Titan average closing prices presented in the table by the corresponding
      exchange ratio.

    The following table and illustration assumes that the Datron common stock
value is $16.00, the approximate value computed as of July 30, 2001.

    THE VALUES OF TITAN COMMON SHARES IN THE TABLE ABOVE ARE ILLUSTRATIVE ONLY
AND DO NOT REPRESENT THE ACTUAL AMOUNTS PER DATRON COMMON SHARE THAT MIGHT BE
REALIZED BY ANY DATRON STOCKHOLDER ON OR AFTER CONSUMMATION OF THE OFFER OR THE
MERGER. THE AMOUNT ANY DATRON STOCKHOLDER MIGHT REALIZE UPON SALE IN THE MARKET
OF TITAN COMMON SHARES RECEIVED BY THE STOCKHOLDER IN THE OFFER OR THE MERGER
WILL DEPEND UPON THE MARKET PRICE PER SHARE OF TITAN COMMON SHARES AT THE TIME
OF SALE, WHICH MAY FLUCTUATE FOR ANY NUMBER OF REASONS, INCLUDING THOSE SPECIFIC
TO TITAN AND THOSE THAT INFLUENCE THE TRADING PRICES OF EQUITY SECURITIES
GENERALLY.

    On July 27, 2001, Titan fixed the Titan common stock price for use in
computing the exchange ratio. The exact exchange ratio will be calculated based
upon $19.544, the average closing sales price for shares of Titan common stock
during the 10-day trading period ending on July 27, 2001.

    MORE INFORMATION ABOUT THE FINAL EXCHANGE RATIO.  Titan will notify you of
the final exchange ratio by issuing a press release announcing the final
exchange ratio and filing that press release with the SEC. Datron stockholders
can call our information agent, D.F. King & Co., Inc., at any time toll free at
(800) 628-8510 to request information about the Titan average closing price,
including the final exchange ratio for the offer, once determined.

PURPOSE OF THE EXCHANGE OFFER

    Titan is making the exchange offer in order to acquire all of the
outstanding shares of Datron common stock. Titan intends, as soon as practicable
after completion of the exchange offer, to have its wholly-owned subsidiary, Gem
Acquisition Corp., the purchaser in the exchange offer, merge with Datron. The
purpose of the merger is to acquire all shares of Datron common stock not
tendered and exchanged pursuant to the exchange offer. In the merger, each then
outstanding share of Datron common stock, except for treasury shares and shares
that Titan or Gem Acquisition Corp. holds for its own account, and, if
applicable, shares of Datron common stock held by stockholders exercising
appraisal rights, would be converted into shares of Titan common stock at the
same exchange ratio used in the exchange offer.

THE MINIMUM TENDER CONDITION

    The obligation of Titan to accept for exchange and to deliver shares of
Titan common stock in exchange for shares of Datron common stock validly
tendered and not properly withdrawn is subject to the condition that the total
number of shares of Datron common stock validly tendered and not properly
withdrawn, when added to any shares of Datron common stock owned by Titan, is
equal to at least a majority of the total number of shares of Datron common
stock outstanding immediately prior to the expiration date of the exchange
offer, as it may be extended pursuant to the merger agreement. For purposes of
computing the minimum tender condition, Titan will not take into account any
shares of Datron common stock tendered into the offer pursuant to a Notice of
Guaranteed Delivery unless stock certificates or book-entry confirmations are
actually received by the Exchange Agent.

EXTENSION; TERMINATION AND AMENDMENT

    Subject to the terms of the merger agreement, Titan has agreed to extend the
exchange offer for 10 business days if the minimum condition for the exchange is
not satisfied by the expiration of the initial offering period of 20 business
days. After the first extension period, Titan may extend the exchange offer for
successive extension periods not in excess of 10 business days per extension if,
at the scheduled expiration date of the exchange offer, any condition to the
exchange offer has not been satisfied or, where permissible, waived. In
addition, Titan is entitled to extend the exchange offer if required by the
rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission, the New York Stock Exchange or
the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. During an extension, all
shares of Datron common stock previously tendered and not properly withdrawn
will remain subject to the exchange offer, subject to your right to withdraw
your shares of Datron common stock. You should read the discussion below in the
section entitled "WITHDRAWAL RIGHTS" for more details.

    Titan reserves the right to make any changes in the terms and conditions of
the exchange offer by giving oral or written notice of the change to the
Exchange Agent and by making a public announcement. However, without the prior
written consent of Datron, Titan cannot:

    - decrease the number of shares of Datron common stock sought in the
      exchange offer;

    - make any changes to the form or amount of consideration to be issued or
      paid for shares of Datron common stock in the exchange offer;

    - impose any additional conditions on the exchange offer other than those
      already described in the merger agreement;

    - amend or waive the minimum tender condition or other specified conditions
      as described in the merger agreement;

    - extend the initial expiration date of the exchange offer, except under
      circumstances described in the merger agreement; or

    - make any other change to the terms and conditions of the exchange offer
      which is adverse to the holders of shares of Datron common stock.

    Titan is required to follow any extension, termination, amendment or delay,
as promptly as practicable, with a public announcement. In the case of an
extension, the announcement is required to be issued no later than 9:00 a.m.,
New York City time, on the next business day after the previously scheduled
expiration date. Subject to applicable law, including Rules 14d-4(d) and
14d-6(c) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, which require that any
material change in the information published, sent or given to stockholders in
connection with the exchange offer be promptly sent to stockholders in a manner
reasonably designed to inform stockholders of the change, and without limiting
the manner in which Titan may choose to make any public announcement, Titan
assumes no obligation to publish, advertise or otherwise communicate any public
announcement other than by making a release to the Dow Jones News Service.

    If Titan makes a material change in the terms of the exchange offer or the
information concerning the exchange offer, or if it waives a material condition
of the exchange offer, Titan will extend the exchange offer to the extent
required under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. If, prior to the expiration
date and after obtaining Datron's prior written consent, Titan changes the
percentage of shares of Datron common stock being sought or the consideration
offered to you, that change will apply to all stockholders whose shares of
Datron common stock are accepted for exchange pursuant to the exchange offer. If
at the time notice of that change is first published, sent or given to you, the
exchange offer is scheduled to expire at any time earlier than the tenth
business day from and including the date that the notice is first so published,
sent or given, Titan is required to extend the exchange offer until the
expiration of that 10 business day period. For purposes of the exchange offer, a
"business day" means any day other than a Saturday, Sunday or federal holiday
and consists of the time period from 12:01 a.m. through 12:00 midnight, New York
City time.

SUBSEQUENT OFFERING PERIOD

    Titan may elect to provide a subsequent offering period of 3 to 20 business
days after the acceptance of shares of Datron common stock in the exchange offer
if the requirements of Rule 14d-11 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934
have been met. You will not have the right to withdraw any shares of Datron
common stock that you tender during the subsequent offering period. Titan is
required to accept for exchange, and to deliver shares of Titan common stock in
exchange for, shares of Datron common stock that are validly tendered and not
properly withdrawn, promptly after they are tendered during any subsequent
offering period. If Titan elects to provide a subsequent offering period, it is
required to make a public announcement to that effect no later than 9:00 a.m.,
New York City time, on the next business day after the previously scheduled
expiration date.

EXCHANGE OF SHARES OF DATRON COMMON STOCK; DELIVERY OF SHARES OF TITAN COMMON
  STOCK

    Upon the terms of, and subject to the conditions to, the exchange offer
including, if the exchange offer is extended or amended, the terms and
conditions of the extension or amendment, Titan is required to accept for
exchange, and to deliver shares of Titan common stock in exchange for, shares

of Datron common stock that are validly tendered and not properly withdrawn,
promptly after the expiration date and promptly after they are tendered during
any subsequent offering period. In all cases, exchange of shares of Datron
common stock tendered and accepted for exchange pursuant to the exchange offer
will be made only after timely receipt by the Exchange Agent of:

    - certificates for the shares of Datron common stock or a confirmation of a
      book-entry transfer of the shares of Datron common stock in the Exchange
      Agent's account at The Depository Trust Company, which is referred to in
      this prospectus as "DTC"; and

    - a properly completed and duly executed letter of transmittal or a manually
      signed facsimile of that document, and any other required documents.

    For purposes of the exchange offer, Titan will be deemed to have accepted
for exchange shares of Datron common stock validly tendered and not properly
withdrawn as, if and when Titan notifies the Exchange Agent of its acceptance of
the tenders of those shares of Datron common stock. The Exchange Agent is
required to then deliver shares of Titan common stock and cash instead of
fractional shares of Titan common stock in exchange for the shares of Datron
common stock promptly after receipt of the notice referred to in the preceding
sentence. The Exchange Agent will act as agent for Titan for the purpose of
receiving shares of Titan common stock and any cash to be paid instead of any
fractional shares of Titan common stock and transmitting a certificate or
certificates for Titan common stock and cash, if any, to you. You will not
receive any interest on any cash that Titan pays to you, even if there is a
delay in making the exchange.

    If Titan does not accept any tendered shares of Datron common stock for
exchange pursuant to the terms and conditions of the exchange offer for any
reason, or if certificates are submitted for more shares of Datron common stock
than are accepted, Titan is required to return certificates for the unexchanged
shares of Datron common stock to the tendering stockholder or, in the case of
shares of Datron common stock tendered by book-entry transfer of unexchanged
shares of Datron common stock into the Exchange Agent's account at the address
on the back page of this prospectus, pursuant to the procedures described below
in the section entitled "PROCEDURE FOR TENDERING," the shares of Datron common
stock will be credited to an account maintained within DTC, as soon as
practicable following expiration or termination of the exchange offer.

CASH INSTEAD OF FRACTIONAL SHARES OF TITAN COMMON STOCK

    Titan will not issue certificates representing fractional shares of its
common stock in the exchange offer. Instead, each tendering stockholder who
would otherwise be entitled to a fractional share (after aggregating all
fractional shares of Titan common stock that otherwise would be received by the
holder) will receive cash (rounded up to the nearest whole cent), without
interest, equal to the product obtained by multiplying:

    - that fraction of a share of Titan common stock to which such stockholder
      is entitled (after aggregating all fractional shares of Titan common stock
      that otherwise would be received by such stockholder), by

    - the closing sales price of one share of Titan common stock on the New York
      Stock Exchange Composite Transaction Tape (as reported in the Wall Street
      Journal or, if not reported therein, any other authoritative source) on
      the date Titan accepts shares for exchange in the offer.

WITHDRAWAL RIGHTS

    Your tender of shares of Datron common stock pursuant to the exchange offer
is irrevocable, except that, other than during a subsequent offering period,
shares of Datron common stock tendered pursuant to the exchange offer may be
withdrawn at any time prior to the expiration date, and, unless Titan previously
accepted them for exchange pursuant to the exchange offer, may also be withdrawn
at any time after August 3, 2001. If Titan elects to provide a subsequent
offering period in accordance with Rule 14d-11 under the Securities Exchange Act
of 1934, you will not have the right to withdraw any shares of Datron common
stock that you tender during the subsequent offering period.

    For your withdrawal to be effective, the Exchange Agent must receive from
you a written, telex or facsimile transmission notice of withdrawal at its
address on the back cover of this prospectus, and your notice must include your
name, address, social security number, the certificate number(s) and the number
of shares of Datron common stock to be withdrawn as well as the name of the
registered holder, if it is different from that of the person who tendered the
shares of Datron common stock.

    A financial institution must guarantee all signatures on the notice of
withdrawal unless the shares of Datron common stock have been tendered for the
account of an eligible institution. Most banks, savings and loan associations
and brokerage houses are able to provide these signature guarantees for you. The
financial institution must be an "eligible institution" which means it is a
participant in the Securities Transfer Agents Medallion Program. If shares of
Datron common stock have been tendered pursuant to the procedures for book-entry
tender discussed under the caption below entitled "PROCEDURE FOR TENDERING," any
notice of withdrawal must specify the name and number of the account at DTC to
be credited with the withdrawn shares of Datron common stock and must otherwise
comply with the DTC procedures. If certificates have been delivered to the
Exchange Agent, the name of the registered stockholder and the serial numbers of
the particular certificates evidencing the shares of Datron common stock
withdrawn must also be furnished to the Exchange Agent, as stated above, prior
to the physical release of the certificates. Titan will decide all questions
regarding the form and validity (including time of receipt) of any notice of
withdrawal, in its sole discretion, and Titan's decision shall be final and
binding.

    Neither Titan, the Exchange Agent, the Information Agent nor any other
person will be under any duty to give notification of any defects or
irregularities in any notice of withdrawal or will incur any liability for
failure to give proper notification. Any shares of Datron common stock properly
withdrawn will be deemed not to have been validly tendered for purposes of the
exchange offer. However, you may retender withdrawn shares of Datron common
stock by following one of the procedures discussed below in the sections
entitled "PROCEDURE FOR TENDERING" or "GUARANTEED DELIVERY" at any time prior to
the expiration date.

PROCEDURE FOR TENDERING

    For you to validly tender shares of Datron common stock pursuant to the
exchange offer, (a) the enclosed letter of transmittal, properly completed and
duly executed or a manually executed facsimile of that document, along with any
required signature guarantees, or an agent's message in connection with a
book-entry transfer, and any other required documents, must be transmitted to
and received by the Exchange Agent at the address on the back cover of this
prospectus, and certificates for tendered shares of Datron common stock must be
received by the Exchange Agent at that address or the shares of Datron common
stock must be tendered pursuant to the procedures for book-entry tender
described below (and a confirmation of receipt of the tender received, which
confirmation Titan refers to below as a "book-entry confirmation"), in each case
before the expiration date, or (b) you must comply with the guaranteed delivery
procedures described below.

    The term "agent's message" means a message, transmitted by DTC to, and
received by, the Exchange Agent and forming a part of a book-entry confirmation,
which states that DTC has received an express acknowledgment from the
participant in DTC tendering the shares of Datron common stock which are the
subject of the book-entry confirmation, that the participant has received and
agrees to be bound by the terms of the letter of transmittal and that Titan may
enforce that agreement against the participant.

    The Exchange Agent is required to establish accounts with respect to the
shares of Datron common stock at DTC for purposes of the exchange offer by
July 9, 2001, and any financial institution that is a participant in DTC may
make book-entry delivery of the shares of Datron common stock by causing DTC to
transfer tendered shares of Datron common stock into the Exchange Agent's
account

in accordance with DTC's procedure for the transfer. However, although delivery
of shares of Datron common stock may be effected through book-entry transfer at
DTC, the letter of transmittal (or a manually signed facsimile thereof), with
any required signature guarantees, or an agent's message in connection with a
book-entry transfer, and any other required documents, must, in any case, be
transmitted to and received by the Exchange Agent at the address on the back
cover of this prospectus prior to the expiration date, or the guaranteed
delivery procedures described below must be followed.

    Signatures on all letters of transmittal must be guaranteed by an eligible
institution, except in cases in which shares of Datron common stock are tendered
either by a registered holder of shares of Datron common stock who has not
completed the box entitled "SPECIAL ISSUANCE INSTRUCTIONS" on the letter of
transmittal or for the account of an eligible institution.

    If the certificates for shares of Datron common stock are registered in the
name of a person other than the person who signs the letter of transmittal, or
if certificates for unexchanged shares of Datron common stock are to be issued
to a person other than the registered holder(s), the certificates must be
endorsed or accompanied by appropriate stock powers, in either case signed
exactly as the name or names of the registered owner or owners appear on the
certificates, with the signature(s) on the certificates or stock powers
guaranteed in the manner Titan has described above.

    THE METHOD OF DELIVERY OF DATRON STOCK CERTIFICATES AND ALL OTHER REQUIRED
DOCUMENTS, INCLUDING DELIVERY THROUGH DTC, IS AT YOUR OPTION AND RISK, AND THE
DELIVERY WILL BE DEEMED MADE ONLY WHEN ACTUALLY RECEIVED BY THE EXCHANGE AGENT.
IF DELIVERY IS BY MAIL, TITAN RECOMMENDS REGISTERED MAIL WITH RETURN RECEIPT
REQUESTED, PROPERLY INSURED. IN ALL CASES, YOU SHOULD ALLOW SUFFICIENT TIME TO
ENSURE TIMELY DELIVERY.

GUARANTEED DELIVERY

    If you wish to tender shares of Datron common stock pursuant to the exchange
offer and your certificates are not immediately available or you cannot deliver
the certificates and all other required documents to the Exchange Agent prior to
the expiration date or cannot complete the procedure for book-entry transfer on
a timely basis, your shares of Datron common stock may nevertheless be tendered,
so long as all of the following conditions are satisfied:

    - you make your tender by or through an eligible institution;

    - the enclosed notice of guaranteed delivery, properly completed and duly
      executed, substantially in the form enclosed with this prospectus, is
      received by the Exchange Agent as provided below on or prior to the
      expiration date; and

    - the certificates for all tendered shares of Datron common stock or a
      confirmation of a book-entry transfer of tendered securities into the
      Exchange Agent's account at DTC as described above, in proper form for
      transfer, together with a properly completed and duly executed letter of
      transmittal or a manually signed facsimile thereof, with any required
      signature guarantees (or, in the case of a book-entry transfer, an agent's
      message), and all other documents required by the letter of transmittal
      are received by the Exchange Agent within three New York Stock Exchange
      trading days after the date of execution of the notice of guaranteed
      delivery.

    You may deliver the notice of guaranteed delivery by hand or transmit it by
facsimile transmission or mail to the Exchange Agent and you must include a
signature guarantee by an eligible institution in the form provided in that
notice.

    In all cases, Titan is required to exchange shares of Datron common stock
tendered and accepted for exchange pursuant to the exchange offer only after
timely receipt by the Exchange Agent of certificates for shares of Datron common
stock (or timely confirmation of a book-entry transfer of

tendered securities into the Exchange Agent's account at DTC as described
above), properly completed and duly executed letter(s) of transmittal or
manually signed facsimile(s) thereof, or an agent's message in connection with a
book-entry transfer, and any other required documents.

    By executing a letter of transmittal as described above, you irrevocably
appoint Titan's designees as your attorneys-in-fact and proxies, each with full
power of substitution, to the full extent of your rights with respect to your
shares of Datron common stock tendered and accepted for exchange by Titan and
with respect to any and all other shares of Datron common stock and other
securities (other than the shares of Titan common stock) issued or issuable in
respect of the shares of Datron common stock on or after August 3, 2001. That
appointment is effective if and when, and only to the extent that, Titan accepts
the shares of Datron common stock for exchange pursuant to the exchange offer.
All of these proxies shall be considered coupled with an interest in the
tendered shares of Datron common stock and therefore shall not be revocable.
Upon the effectiveness of the appointment, all prior proxies that you have given
will be revoked, and you may not give any subsequent proxies (and, if given,
they will not be deemed effective). Titan's designees will, with respect to the
shares of Datron common stock for which the appointment is effective, be
empowered, among other things, to exercise all of your voting and other rights
as they, in their sole discretion, deem proper at any annual, special or
adjourned meeting of Datron stockholders or otherwise. Titan reserves the right
to require that, in order for shares of Datron common stock to be deemed validly
tendered, immediately upon Titan's exchange of the shares, Titan must be able to
exercise full voting rights with respect to the tendered shares of Datron common
stock.

    Titan will determine questions regarding the validity, form, eligibility
(including time of receipt) and acceptance for exchange of any tender of shares
of Datron common stock, in its sole discretion, and its determination shall be
final and binding. Titan reserves the absolute right to reject any and all
tenders of shares of Datron common stock that it determines are not in proper
form or the acceptance of or exchange for which may, in the opinion of its
counsel, be unlawful. Titan also reserves the absolute right to waive any defect
or irregularity in the tender of any shares of Datron common stock. No tender of
shares of Datron common stock will be deemed to have been validly made until all
defects and irregularities in tenders of shares of Datron common stock have been
cured or waived. Neither Titan, the Exchange Agent, the Information Agent nor
any other person will be under any duty to give notification of any defects or
irregularities in the tender of any shares of Datron common stock or will incur
any liability for failure to give notification. Titan's interpretation of the
terms and conditions of the exchange offer (including the letter of transmittal
and instructions thereto) will be final and binding.

    The tender of shares of Datron common stock pursuant to any of the
procedures described above will constitute a binding agreement between Titan and
you upon the terms and subject to the conditions to the exchange offer.

BACKGROUND OF THE TRANSACTION

    In August 1999, Datron engaged Philpott Ball & Werner, or PBW, as its
financial advisor to assist Datron in seeking strategic alternatives to maximize
stockholder value. In September 1999, Datron received from L-3 Communications
Corporation an unsolicited written expression of interest in acquiring Datron.
After consulting with the Datron board, David A. Derby, Datron's Chairman,
President and Chief Executive Officer, arranged to meet with L-3 Communications'
management to discuss a possible acquisition of Datron by L-3 Communications.
Mr. Derby and a representative of PBW met with L-3 Communications' management in
early October 1999. After a discussion of Datron's and L-3 Communications'
businesses, Mr. Derby indicated that he would be interested in further
discussions with L-3 Communications after it had completed another acquisition
in which it was then engaged. Datron heard nothing further from L-3
Communications at that time.

    In November 1999, after an introduction made by a member of the board of
directors of Titan, representatives of Datron made a presentation to senior
executives of Titan relating to a possible transaction between the two
companies. After these presentations, Titan informed Datron that, given Titan's
engagement with several other significant transactions, Titan would not be able
to pursue a transaction with Datron at that time.

    In February 2000, Datron specifically engaged PBW to find a buyer for
Datron's subsidiary, Datron World Communications, Inc., or Datron World. In
August 2000, L-3 Communications sent PBW a written expression of interest in
acquiring the assets of Datron World. In the course of discussions and due
diligence with respect to Datron World during August and September 2000, L-3
Communications again expressed an interest in acquiring not just Datron World
but all of Datron. On September 15, 2000, L-3 Communications and Datron executed
a confidentiality agreement, including a one-year standstill arrangement, with
respect to a possible acquisition of Datron. Although Datron indicated that it
would be receptive to an acquisition proposal by L-3 Communications, and
although Datron's officers made a presentation to L-3 Communications, L-3
Communications did not pursue further acquisition discussions with Datron. In
October 2000, L-3 Communications informed PBW that it would not be interested in
an acquisition transaction with Datron or in acquiring the assets of Datron
World. Throughout the discussions with L-3 Communications, Datron management
regularly advised the board about developments in the discussions.

    After exploration of opportunities to sell Datron World, the Datron board
concluded that many of the likely buyers for Datron World were either themselves
for sale or undergoing some form of reorganization and that opportunities for a
favorable sale of Datron World were limited at that time. The Datron board
decided instead to explore the possibility of acquiring another company. During
the period from April 2000 to March 2001 Datron engaged in preliminary
discussions with respect to possible acquisitions of or mergers with several
companies, but none of the opportunities were deemed suitable.

    With respect to the possibility of being acquired, Datron concluded that
either there was no serious interest or the consideration suggested by such
potential acquirors did not adequately reflect the value of Datron and, in one
instance, it was doubtful that the potential acquiror had the financial
capability to complete an acquisition of Datron. With respect to the possibility
of acquiring other companies, Datron identified two possible candidates with
complementary businesses. However, after conducting more detailed financial and
business reviews of these companies, Datron concluded they represented too great
a financial and business risk.

    Beginning in November 2000, Acquisitor plc, a United Kingdom company,
started accumulating shares of Datron common stock in market transactions. On
November 15, 2000, Acquisitor filed a statement on Schedule 13D with the SEC
announcing that it had beneficially acquired 7.26% of Datron's common stock and
stating that the purpose of its investment was to have open communications with
the management of Datron in order to monitor their efforts to increase
stockholder value. Acquisitor also stated in its initial Schedule 13D filing
that it may in the future take such actions with respect to its investment in
Datron as it deems appropriate including, without limitation, purchasing
additional shares of common stock in the open market or otherwise, making an
offer to purchase up to all of Datron's outstanding shares of common stock
through a negotiated transaction or otherwise, seeking to nominate a slate of
directors to Datron's board of directors or presenting proposals for
stockholders' consideration at an annual or special meeting of the Datron
stockholders. In the period of time from November 15, 2000 to February 2001,
Acquisitor continued to periodically purchase additional shares of Datron common
stock. To Datron's knowledge, currently Acquisitor beneficially owns
approximately 14.97% of Datron's outstanding common stock. Datron management has
kept the Datron board advised of Acquisitor's accumulations of Datron common
stock on a periodic basis.

    On April 24, 2001, Acquisitor sent a letter to the Chairman of the Board of
Directors of Datron requesting, among other things, that Datron (i) appoint two
persons designated by Acquisitor to serve on Datron's board of directors,
(ii) eliminate Datron's Stockholders' Rights Plan, and (iii) amend Datron's
charter and bylaws to allow a 10% or greater stockholder to call a special
meeting of the stockholders. The April 24, 2001 letter also called for a review
of strategic alternatives available to Datron including a sale of Datron and/or
a change in Datron's management. The Datron board considered Acquisitor's letter
and determined not to comply with Acquisitor's requests. Between November 2000
and April 2001, Duncan Soukup, Acquisitor's managing director, had one meeting
and several telephone conversations with members of Datron's management to
discuss Datron's business, operations and plans. Also, during that time period,
representatives of Acquisitor and Lionheart Group, Inc., an affiliate of
Acquisitor, contacted Datron's officers to discuss publicly available
information about Datron. Datron management kept the Datron board informed of
significant events associated with Acquisitor. On May 18, 2001, in a letter
addressed to Datron, Acquisitor notified Datron that Acquisitor intended to
nominate four of its designees for election to the Datron board and to conduct a
proxy contest to elect Acquisitor's designees to the Datron board. In a separate
letter to the board of directors of Datron, also dated May 18, 2001, Acquisitor
offered, among other things, not to solicit proxies to replace members of the
Datron board if Datron engaged an investment bank with a proven track record in
aerospace, defense and communication industries acceptable to Acquisitor,
redeemed Datron's poison pill and included two of Acquisitor's nominees in
Datron's slate of nominees for director. The Datron board considered and
declined to accept Acquisitor's proposal. Before the board's decision to decline
Acquisitor's proposal was conveyed to Acquisitor, Acquisitor withdrew its offer
to not solicit proxies for its board nominees in a letter dated May 31, 2001. On
June 22, 2001, Acquisitor filed preliminary proxy materials with the SEC for the
purpose of contesting the election of Datron's nominees to the board and
electing Acquisitor's own nominees.

    On March 23, 2001, Mr. Derby received an unsolicited letter from BNP
Paribas, a financial advisor based in New York, seeking information about
Datron, and inquiring whether Datron would be interested in discussions about a
possible transaction. In a subsequent telephone conversation BNP Paribas
identified its client as Zodiac SA, a company domiciled in France. On April 9,
2001, Mr. Derby met with representatives of BNP Paribas. On May 18, 2001, Zodiac
signed a confidentiality agreement, including a one-year standstill arrangement,
with Datron, and on May 24, 2001 Zodiac received a confidential memorandum
describing Datron's business. A meeting between representatives of Datron and
representatives of Zodiac was scheduled for June 18 and 19, 2001 to take place
in Paris during Mr. Derby's business trip to Paris in connection with the Paris
Air Show. That meeting was canceled by Datron on June 18, 2001 after Datron
signed a no-shop agreement with Titan.

    On May 1, 2001, Dr. Gene Ray, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Titan,
called Mr. Derby to request a meeting to discuss the potential synergies between
Titan's e-tenna technology and Datron's mobile satellite communication products.
On May 3, 2001, Dr. Ray sent Mr. Derby materials on e-tenna, together with a
proprietary information agreement that Mr. Derby signed and returned to Titan.

    On May 8, 2001, a newspaper article about Acquisitor's acquisition of Datron
common stock was published in the San Diego Union-Tribune. On May 9, 2001,
Dr. Ray called Mr. Derby to inquire about the San Diego Union-Tribune article
and to inquire about Acquisitor's intentions. Dr. Ray and Mr. Derby agreed to
meet the next day.

    On May 10, 2001, Dr. Ray and Mr. Derby met in Vista, California and
discussed each company's business plans and strategies. On the same day,
Mr. Derby and Dr. Ray executed a confidentiality agreement, including a one-year
standstill arrangement, in connection with a possible acquisition transaction
between Titan and Datron, and Mr. Derby provided to Dr. Ray certain Datron
financial information. Dr. Ray and Mr. Derby agreed to meet again on May 18,
2001.

    On May 18, 2001, Mr. Derby and William Stephan, Chief Financial Officer of
Datron, met at Titan's offices with Dr. Ray and Mellon Baird, Chief Executive
Officer of Titan Systems Corporation, a subsidiary of Titan, to discuss various
aspects of Datron's business and strategies. At that meeting Datron provided to
Titan certain business forecast data, and Dr. Ray expressed Titan's interest in
pursuing an acquisition of Datron.

    On May 31, 2001, in a telephone conversation between Dr. Ray and Mr. Derby,
Dr. Ray proposed that Titan acquire Datron in a stock-for-stock transaction.
Mr. Derby responded that Datron would consider Titan's proposal.

    On June 1, 2001, Messrs. Derby and Stephan met with Dr. Ray and Eric
DeMarco, Titan's Chief Operating Officer. Mr. Stephan presented an analysis of
anticipated cost savings that would result from a business combination of Datron
and Titan. Messrs. Derby, Stephan and DeMarco and Dr. Ray discussed the general
structure of a stock-for-stock transaction, including pricing terms.

    Later in the day, on June 1, 2001, Mr. Derby received a fax from Acquisitor
with an attached letter from L-3 Communications addressed to Acquisitor. The
letter contained L-3 Communications' expression of interest in a possible
acquisition of the assets of Datron. Dr. Ray called Mr. Derby later that day and
offered specific pricing terms for Titan's acquisition proposal. At that time,
Mr. Derby informed Dr. Ray that Datron had received an expression of interest
from another company. Dr. Ray informed Mr. Derby that Titan would provide Datron
a written expression of interest by June 4, 2001.

    On June 4, 2001, Datron received Titan's written expression of interest in
acquiring Datron in a stock-for-stock transaction. The expression of interest
included pricing terms and an adjustment mechanism, or collar, that would adjust
the exchange ratio in response to changes in the average price of Titan stock
over a specified period of time. Later that day, Datron convened a special
telephonic meeting of the Datron board. Representatives of PBW and Heller Ehrman
White & McAuliffe LLP, Datron's legal counsel, participated in the meeting and
provided financial and legal advice to the Datron board. The Datron board
discussed the expression of interest from L-3 Communications and reviewed the
prior history of discussions with that company. The Datron board then reviewed
and discussed Titan's written expression of interest. The Datron board also
considered other possible options available to Datron, including the fact that
Datron had preliminary discussions with financial advisors for Zodiac. At the
end of the meeting, the board unanimously authorized Datron's management to
proceed with negotiations with Titan as expeditiously as possible. PBW was
instructed to contact L-3 Communications and request that L-3 Communications
clarify its proposal and communicate directly with Datron's management rather
than with Acquisitor, which was not authorized to receive acquisition proposals
on behalf of Datron.

    On June 6, 2001, Titan and its outside legal counsel, Cooley Godward LLP,
began a due diligence review of Datron. Simultaneously, Cooley Godward began
drafting definitive acquisition documents. On June 7, 2001, PBW conducted a due
diligence review of Titan and reported to Datron's management the results of its
review. On June 8, 2001, Datron's management conducted additional due diligence
with respect to Titan.

    On June 9, 2001, Titan provided to Datron for review drafts of the
definitive acquisition documents. Between June 13 and June 22, 2001, senior
management and the legal advisors of Titan and Datron conducted a series of
discussions of the terms of the acquisition agreements during several meetings
and conference calls.

    On June 11, 2001, Datron received a letter from L-3 Communications addressed
to Datron. The letter contained an expression of interest in a transaction
pursuant to which L-3 Communications would acquire substantially all of the
assets and assume the liabilities of Datron for approximately $52.0 million in
cash. The expression of interest included a number of assumptions and
contingencies including completion of confirmatory due diligence and the
assumption that Datron would have

$11.0 million of cash on hand and debt of $3.0 million. In that letter, L-3
Communications also requested that Datron agree to a 60-day exclusive
negotiation period with L-3 Communications and a break-up fee of $3.0 million
payable in the event of a breach of the exclusivity arrangement. On June 13,
2001, in a letter on behalf of Datron, PBW responded to L-3 Communications that
(i) a transaction involving the sale of assets would have an adverse tax
consequence for Datron and its stockholders, (ii) a 60-day period of exclusive
negotiations with L-3 Communications would not be acceptable to Datron, and
(iii) a break-up fee would only be appropriate in a definitive agreement and not
in connection with an agreement to negotiate exclusively with L-3
Communications. The PBW letter also informed L-3 Communications that Acquisitor
was not an authorized representative of Datron. On June 14, 2001, L-3
Communications orally advised PBW that it would modify its cash for assets
proposal and would propose to acquire all of Datron's common stock for
approximately $52.0 million in cash. L-3 Communications would require Datron to
agree to a 45-day exclusivity period but would defer requiring a $3.0 million
break-up fee until execution of a definitive agreement. The other assumptions
and contingencies would remain as expressed in L-3 Communications' June 11, 2001
letter.

    On June 15, 2001, the Datron board convened a special meeting with
representatives of PBW and Heller Ehrman present at the meeting. The Datron
board reviewed with Heller Ehrman the structure of the proposed acquisition by
Titan, the pricing terms and the other terms and provisions of the drafts of the
merger agreement and other related agreements. The Datron board discussed PBW's
written analysis of the transaction and received PBW's oral, preliminary opinion
that the transaction was fair to the stockholders of Datron from a financial
point of view. The Datron board was advised by PBW that on June 14, 2001, L-3
Communications had modified its expression of interest in a transaction with
Datron and now proposed to acquire all of Datron's common stock. The Datron
board discussed the price and other terms of the transaction proposed by L-3
Communications. The Datron board unanimously authorized management to continue
negotiating the definitive acquisition agreements with Titan and scheduled
another meeting after final drafts of the definitive acquisition agreements were
distributed to the board.

    On June 15, 2001, Datron agreed with Titan that Datron would cancel a
meeting with Zodiac previously scheduled for June 18 and 19, 2001, if before the
time for the meeting major business issues in the definitive acquisition
documents were resolved in principle. On June 15, 2001, Datron signed a no-shop
agreement with Titan in which it agreed not to engage in acquisition discussions
with any other party until 5 p.m., California time, on June 20, 2001. Datron
agreed to the no-shop agreement with Titan because it believed that (i) it was
very close to signing a favorable agreement with Titan that was subject to very
limited contingencies, (ii) Titan would walk away from the transaction if Datron
declined to sign the no-shop agreement and chose instead to discuss more
speculative transactions with others and (iii) the no shop requested was only
for five days. On June 15, 2001, PBW was instructed by Datron not to respond to
L-3 Communications because Datron had signed a no-shop agreement with Titan.

    On June 22, 2001, the Datron board convened a special meeting and discussed
with legal counsel the draft merger agreement and other related agreements.
Management reported on the progress of the negotiations with Titan since the
last meeting and the final pricing terms. The Datron board also received PBW's
oral opinion that the proposed consideration to be paid pursuant to the merger
agreement was fair to the stockholders of Datron from a financial point of view,
and PBW confirmed that it would subsequently provide a written opinion to the
Datron board. The Datron board unanimously approved the acquisition of Datron by
Titan, the proposed exchange offer, the merger, the merger agreement and related
agreements and voted unanimously to recommend the acquisition to the Datron
stockholders.

    Datron and Titan executed the merger agreement on June 24, 2001, and
announced the transaction in press releases on the morning of June 25, 2001.

    On June 25, 2001, PBW received a letter from L-3 Communications expressing
surprise at the announced acquisition of Datron by Titan and questioning certain
matters related to the expression of interest by L-3 Communications and the
subsequent interactions between Datron representatives and L-3 Communications.

    On June 26, 2001, Heller Ehrman, in a letter on behalf of Datron, responded
to the June 25, 2001 letter from L-3 Communications explaining, among other
things, that the Datron board had acted responsibly and had determined to enter
into a transaction with Titan. On June 27, 2001, Datron filed with the
Securities and Exchange Commission a Current Report on Form 8-K attaching the
L-3 Communications letters and Datron's responses to each of the letters.

    On June 28, 2001, Datron received another letter from L-3 Communications
containing a proposal to acquire all of Datron's common stock, including
options, for $16.25 per share, subject to the cash balances and net assets of
Datron having remained at the levels disclosed in Datron's March 31, 2001
balance sheet. The letter also indicated that L-3 Communications would perform
confirmatory due diligence and negotiate the terms of the transaction before
entering into a definitive agreement.

    The Datron board met by conference telephone call on June 29, 2001, and
discussed L-3's proposal. PBW, Heller Ehrman and Datron's Delaware counsel
consulted with the board, and PBW expressed its view that L-3's proposal was not
superior to the Titan transaction. The Datron board concluded that L-3's most
recent proposal was not superior to the Titan transaction for the reasons
described below in the section "DATRON'S REASONS FOR THE EXCHANGE OFFER AND THE
MERGER."

    On July 3, 2001, Datron sent a letter to L-3 Communications stating that the
Datron board had determined that L-3 Communications' June 28, 2001 acquisition
proposal was not superior to the Titan transaction. On the same day, Datron
filed with the SEC a Current Report on Form 8-K attaching L-3 Communications'
June 28, 2001 letter and Datron's July 3, 2001 response.

DATRON'S REASONS FOR THE EXCHANGE OFFER AND THE MERGER

    In reaching its decision to approve the merger agreement, including the
offer and the merger, the Datron board considered the factors described below:

    OPTIMIZED STOCKHOLDER VALUE.  The Datron board considered the fact that the
value of the Titan common stock that Datron stockholders would receive for their
Datron common stock would represent a premium over recent and historical market
values of Datron common stock. The Datron board also considered the benefits of
owning stock of a company with a large market capitalization, noting that, the
stock of small capitalization companies can be volatile, and historically, large
capitalization stocks have tended to be somewhat less volatile than small
capitalization stocks. The Datron board also noted that the expenses associated
with being a publicly-held company are disproportionately high for companies
with a small market capitalization.

    TAX-FREE REORGANIZATION.  The Datron board also considered the fact that the
transaction with Titan was structured as a tax-free reorganization, which would
allow stockholders flexibility in their personal tax planning. Those who wished
to defer taxes could retain the Titan common stock they receive in the
transaction while others who did not choose to defer taxes could sell their
Titan common stock and pay taxes on any gain currently. Further, Datron
stockholders who hold Datron common stock as a capital asset but who had not
held their Datron stock long enough to qualify for long-term capital gains
treatment could elect to hold Titan stock until the combined periods during
which they held Datron and Titan common stock were long enough to qualify for
long-term capital gains treatment.

    STOCKHOLDER LIQUIDITY.  The weekly trading volume of Titan common stock on
the New York Stock Exchange relative to the number of shares of Titan common
stock to be received by Datron stockholders in the transaction is significant.
The Datron board believed that those stockholders who

wished to liquidate their Titan holdings would be able to do so readily in a
short period of time. By contrast, the weekly trading volume of Datron common
stock on the Nasdaq National Market System is relatively low.

    STRATEGIC FACTORS.  Datron and Titan have similar technological and cultural
backgrounds stemming from their development and production of products for the
U.S. Department of Defense. Both companies have successfully adapted
technologies developed in support of defense contracts for commercial and
consumer applications. The Datron board believed that the companies'
technologies and research and development resources complement each other and
that the combination of Datron and Titan would result in a combined company with
an enhanced development capability and expanded product base. The Datron board
also believed that Datron's experience in financing international sales and its
historically strong international distribution network would be a significant
asset to Titan. The Datron board believed that, as a result of these and other
factors, the combined company could achieve overall increases in sales greater
than the companies might achieve operating independently.

    MOST FAVORABLE OPPORTUNITY.  The Datron board believed that the transaction
with Titan was the transaction most favorable to the Datron stockholders that
had been or was likely to be presented to Datron. The Datron board's belief is
based, in part, on a comparison of the indications of interest that Datron has
received during the time that PBW has been engaged to seek alternatives to
maximize stockholder value. Discussions with other potential acquirors,
including Zodiac, had not advanced beyond preliminary stages. At its June 29,
2001 meeting, the Datron board concluded, after consultation with PBW, that the
June 28, 2001 proposal from L-3 Communications was not superior to the Titan
transaction. PBW noted that the price L-3 Communications proposed was nominally
higher than the price of the Titan transaction and that L-3 Communications had
proposed cash consideration, which was not subject to the market risks to which
Titan's stock consideration was subject. PBW also noted, however, that L-3
Communications' proposal was not an unconditional offer and the consideration
would be taxable to Datron stockholders. Before L-3 Communications would enter
into a binding commitment, it proposed to conduct confirmatory due diligence and
negotiate the terms of the agreements. Further, L-3 Communications' proposal
stated that the proposed price was based on there being no changes in Datron's
net cash and net assets from the amounts reflected in its March 31, 2001 balance
sheet. Datron's net cash had declined materially since March 31, 2001. Datron's
cash would be further reduced by the break-up fee payable to Titan if Datron
consummated a transaction with L-3 Communications. These conditions would likely
result in a further negotiation of or adjustment to the price. In view of the
significant uncertainty as to whether a transaction could be completed with L-3
Communications and as to the terms of such transaction, PBW did not believe that
L-3 Communications' proposal was superior to the Titan transaction. The Datron
board and PBW also considered the past history of dealings with L-3
Communications, including the fact that in both 1999 and 2000 L-3 Communications
had given Datron written indications of interest in acquiring Datron and in each
case, after only limited discussions, had communicated that it no longer had an
interest in an acquisition. In view of its past dealings with L-3 Communications
and the contingencies associated with L-3 Communications' proposal, the Datron
board was not confident that a transaction could be completed with L-3
Communications on the terms in its proposal. Based on these factors, including
its consultation with PBW, the Datron board concluded that L-3 Communications'
proposal was not superior to the Titan transaction. In addition, in making its
decision that the Titan transaction is the most favorable opportunity, the Board
of Datron also considered the nature of the original contact between Mr. Derby
and Zodiac's representatives, the length of time it took for Zodiac to execute
and return a standard non-disclosure agreement and the fact that neither Zodiac
nor its representatives exhibited any urgency to begin discussions with Datron.
In light of the foregoing, the Datron Board noted that the transaction and
negotiations with Titan were progressing satisfactorily and that it would not be
prudent to put a highly probable transaction with Titan at risk by delaying it
to explore what might or might not become an indication of interest by Zodiac.

    CONSIDERATION.  The Datron board believes that the merger agreement with
Titan provides for a fair method of combining the equities of the two companies
and that the consideration to be received by the Datron stockholders is fair to
the Datron stockholders. In reaching this conclusion, the Datron board relied in
part upon its own knowledge of Datron's financial condition, results of
operations, business, technologies, services and products, on both a historical
and prospective basis, as well as current industry, economic and market
conditions. The Datron board also considered the opinion of its financial
advisor, PBW, that the transaction is fair to the stockholders of Datron from a
financial point of view.

    The above discussion of the information and factors considered by the Datron
board is not intended to be exhaustive but is believed to include all material
factors considered by the Datron board. In view of the variety of factors
considered by the Datron board in connection with its evaluation of the offer
and the merger, the Datron board did not find it practicable to and did not
quantify or otherwise assign relative weights to the specific factors considered
in reaching its determination. In addition, the Datron board did not reach any
specific conclusion on each factor considered, or any aspect of any particular
factor, but conducted an overall analysis of these factors. Individual members
of the Datron board may have given different weight to different factors.
However, after taking into account all of the factors described above, the
Datron board has unanimously approved the merger agreement, determined that the
exchange offer and the merger are advisable and fair to, and in the best
interests of, Datron stockholders and unanimously recommends that Datron
stockholders accept the exchange offer and tender their shares pursuant to the
exchange offer.

OPINION OF PHILPOTT BALL & WERNER

    Datron retained PBW in August 1999 to act as its financial adviser in
connection with a possible merger and related matters. Datron selected PBW as
its financial advisor based on Datron's knowledge of PBW developed in the course
of an informal relationship over a number of years. A former investment banker
to Datron introduced George Ball of PBW to Mr. Derby prior to 1999. PBW and
Datron developed an informal relationship in which PBW advised Datron from time
to time on various financial matters. When Datron decided to seek strategic
alternatives to maximize stockholder value in 1999, it selected PBW as its
financial advisor based on the mutual trust that had been established between
the two firms over the years.

    As part of its engagement, PBW agreed to render an opinion with respect to
the fairness, from a financial point of view, of the subject transaction if
requested by Datron's board. In connection with the offer and the merger, PBW
rendered an opinion, dated June 22, 2001, to the Datron board that, as of the
date of the opinion, the consideration to be paid pursuant to the merger
agreement was fair to Datron's stockholders from a financial point of view.
While Titan proposed the original terms of the transaction (including an
exchange price), the terms of the offer and merger resulted from the
negotiations between Datron, whom PBW assisted, and Titan. The opinion was based
upon a review of the companies from a financial point of view.

    The summary of the opinion contained in this prospectus is qualified in its
entirety by reference to the full text of the opinion, dated June 22, 2001,
which has been filed as ANNEX C hereto and is incorporated herein by reference.
The opinion contains a description of the matters considered by PBW and the
limitations on the scope of its investigation. Datron stockholders are
encouraged to read the opinion carefully and in its entirety.

    The opinion is addressed to the Datron board in connection with its
evaluation of the offer and the merger, and it does not constitute a
recommendation to the Datron board to proceed with the merger. Additionally, the
opinion does not constitute a recommendation to any holder of Datron common
stock as to whether to tender shares pursuant to the offer or vote for the
merger. The opinion relates solely to the question of fairness to Datron
stockholders, from a financial point of view, of the

consideration to be received pursuant to the merger agreement. Further, PBW
expresses no opinion as to the structure, terms or effect of any other aspect of
the merger, including, without limitation, any effect resulting from the
application of any bankruptcy proceeding, fraudulent conveyance, or other
international, federal or state insolvency law, or of any pending or threatened
litigation affecting Datron or Titan. PBW also expresses no opinion as to the
tax consequences of the offer or merger.

    As part of its engagement, PBW's activities included, but were not limited
to, the following:

    (i) a review of successive drafts of the merger agreement;

    (ii) discussions with Datron's management concerning the nature of the
         negotiations and the terms of the merger agreement;

   (iii) an investigation of the current operations and future prospects of
         Datron and Titan and thorough interviews with members of Datron's and
         Titan's respective management representatives;

    (iv) a review of the projected exchange ratio of shares of Datron per share
         of Titan based upon the terms of the merger agreement;

    (v) a review of certain Datron and Titan historical financial statements and
        the financial projections of Datron and Titan;

    (vi) a review of the market data for stocks of public companies in the same
         or similar lines of business as Datron and Titan, including
         calculations of public market valuations relative to various financial
         measures including revenue, EBITDA and EBIT;

   (vii) a review of certain acquisitions which PBW deemed comparable for
         analytical purposes;

  (viii) an analysis of the valuations of Datron's and Titan's share prices or
         values based on the discounted present value of respective projected
         cash flows;

    (ix) a review of the industries in which Datron and Titan operate; and

    (x) other analyses which PBW deemed necessary.

    On June 15, 2001, PBW was informed by Datron of the no-shop agreement with
Titan and was instructed not to respond to L-3 concerning L-3's renewed
expression of interest in a transaction with Datron.

    PBW relied upon and assumed, without independent verification, the accuracy
and completeness of all financial and other information publicly available, or
furnished to, or otherwise discussed with PBW, including financial statements
and financial projections, as provided by the management of Datron and Titan.
PBW was not engaged to, and did not, independently verify the information
provided and performed no audit of assets or liabilities and no independent
appraisal of assets or liabilities of either Datron or Titan. PBW has relied
upon the assurances of the management of Datron and Titan that they are not
aware of any facts that would make such information inaccurate or misleading.
The analyses performed by PBW are not necessarily indicative of actual values,
or actual future results that may be significantly more or less favorable than
suggested by such analyses. Such analyses were prepared solely as a part of
PBW's analysis of the fairness, from a financial point of view, to Datron's
stockholders, of the consideration to be paid pursuant to the merger agreement.

    In rendering the opinion, PBW applied its judgment to a variety of complex
analyses and assumptions. PBW may have given various analyses more or less
weight than other analyses and may have deemed various assumptions more or less
probable than other assumptions. The assumptions made and the judgments applied
by PBW in rendering its opinion are not readily susceptible to description
beyond that set forth in the written text of the opinion itself.

    The opinion is necessarily based on economic, market and other conditions in
effect on, and the information made available to PBW as of, the date of the
opinion. The opinion, in any event, is limited to the fairness, from a financial
point of view, to Datron's stockholders of the consideration to be paid to the
stockholders pursuant to the merger agreement.

    Each of the analyses conducted by PBW was carried out to provide a different
perspective on the merger and to enhance the total mix of information. PBW did
not form a conclusion as to whether any individual analysis, considered in
isolation, supported or failed to support an opinion as to the fairness to the
Datron stockholders, from a financial point of view, of the consideration to be
received pursuant to the merger agreement. PBW did not place any specific
reliance or weight on any individual analysis, but instead concluded that its
analyses, taken as a whole, supported its determination. Accordingly, PBW
believes that its analyses must be considered as a whole and that selecting
portions of its analyses or the factors it considered, without considering all
analyses and factors collectively, could create an incomplete view of the
process underlying the analyses performed by PBW in connection with the
preparation of the opinion.

    The following is a brief summary of the material analyses performed by PBW
in preparing the opinion.

    SELECTED PUBLIC COMPANY ANALYSIS.  Using publicly available information, PBW
compared selected financial data of Datron with similar data for 10 small
capitalization communication companies (i) that do substantial business with the
U.S. government and (ii) that have annual revenues of up to $2.0 billion and
averaging $603.0 million, referred to as the electronic communications peers.
PBW considered the electronic communications peers to be engaged in businesses
reasonably comparable to those of Datron and to have operating, organizational
and overall business similarities with Datron, but noted that none of these
companies has the same management, composition, size or combination of
businesses as Datron. The electronic communications peers are:

    - Andrew Corporation

    - Applied Signal Technology, Inc.

    - Comtech Telecommunications Corp.

    - DRS Technologies, Inc.

    - EMS Technologies, Inc.

    - Harris Corporation

    - L-3 Communications

    - Paravant Inc.

    - Raydyne Comstream, Inc.

    - RELM Wireless Communications

    The median, mean and adjusted mean (excluding the maximum and minimum
values) valuation multiples for the electronic communications peer group were
determined. Based upon a review of that information and closing stock prices on
June 19, 2001, PBW determined that the exchange offer and Datron's current stock
price generally are above the median, mean and adjusted mean valuation levels of
its peer group.

                                                                DATRON
ELECTRONIC COMMUNICATION PEERS

- -------------------------------------
                                                  OFFER         PRICE
MEDIAN         MEAN        ADJ. MEAN
                                                 --------      --------
- --------      --------      ---------

Total Invested Capital to:
TTM Revenue....................................     0.8x          0.7x
1.1x          1.0x           1.0x
TTM EBITDA.....................................    16.0x         13.0x
8.4x          8.9x           8.7x
TTM EBIT.......................................    37.9x         30.9x
12.1x         13.6x          12.6x

Note: Total invested capital includes debt and equity. TTM means the trailing 12
months ended March 31, 2001. Adj. Mean equals the mean less the maximum and
minimum values in the data set.

    PBW also calculated a range of imputed values for the equity of Datron based
on the valuation multiples for the electronic communication peers. PBW used the
average multiples of the peer group, after excluding maximum and minimum values
and negative multiples. PBW discounted the valuation multiples after considering
the size and financial performance of each peer group company relative to
Datron's size and performance. Additionally, PBW applied a premium for control
to the valuation multiples in order to determine the imputed value of Datron for
comparison to the offer. This analysis

resulted in an implied value for Datron of $36.7 million (less debt and plus
cash). PBW noted that the equity valuation of the offer and merger of
$51.0 million is considerably above this implied value.

    SELECTED TRANSACTION ANALYSIS.  Hundreds of transactions were screened in an
attempt to find business combinations involving companies similar to Datron.
This analysis is limited to analyzing transactions involving public companies
for which financial and valuation data is publicly disclosed.

    Using publicly available information, PBW examined the following
transactions involving manufacturers of communication and electronic equipment,
referred to as the guideline transactions:

    The median valuation multiples for the guideline transactions were
determined. Based upon a review of that information, PBW determined that the
exchange offer and Datron's current stock price are generally above the mean and
median valuations implied in the guideline transactions.

                                                                          DATRON

       12.3x

Note: Total invested capital includes debt and equity. TTM means the trailing 12
months ended March 31, 2001.

    PBW calculated a range of imputed values for the equity of Datron based on
the valuation multiples for the guideline transactions. PBW discounted the
valuation multiples after considering the size and financial performance of the
acquired companies relative to Datron's size and performance. This analysis
resulted in an implied value for the equity of Datron of $37.4 million (less
debt and plus cash). PBW again noted that the equity valuation of the offer and
merger was $51.0 million, well above this implied value.

    DISCOUNTED CASH FLOW ANALYSIS.  PBW performed a discounted cash flow, or
DCF, analysis for Datron on a stand-alone basis using management's projections
as adjusted by PBW for the risks that are associated with the implementation of
Datron's growth strategies. The discounted future net cash flow was calculated
assuming a weighted average cost of capital (discount rate) of 13.9%, developed
using the capital asset pricing model, and was comprised of the sum of the
present values of:

    - the projected unlevered net free cash flows for the years 2001 through
      2005; and

    - the anticipated future 2005 terminal value. The terminal value was
      determined by calculating multiples of projected 2005 EBITDA ranging from
      6.0x to 7.0x.

    This analysis implies a reference range of prices per share of Datron from
$13.48 per share to $14.94 per share. The reference range was not materially
changed by reasonable variations of key assumptions. PBW noted that the equity
valuation of the offer and merger of $51 million is well above this implied
value.

    ACQUISITION TRANSACTION PREMIUM ANALYSIS.  Using publicly available
information, PBW examined 36 additional transactions involving publicly traded
aerospace and defense firms to determine premiums paid in these transactions
over the applicable stock price of the target company 30 days prior to the
announcement of the acquisition offer. The following table summarizes the
premiums indicated from the above transactions:

PREMIUM   FREQUENCY   PERCENTAGE
- -------   ---------   ----------

  20.0%         3         8.3%
  40.0%         9        25.0%
  60.0%        14        38.9%
  80.0%         4        11.1%
 100.0%         3         8.3%
 120.0%         2         5.6%
 140.0%         0         0.0%
 More           1         2.8%

    This analysis implies a reference range of prices per share of Datron from
$13.24 per share to $17.65 per share, using premiums of 20% and 60%,
respectively, as applied to Datron's average 60-day closing price of $11.03 as
of June 19, 2001. The range of premiums used is representative of over 70% of
the acquisition transactions included in PBW's analysis. PBW noted that the
valuation of the offer and merger are within the range computed in this
analysis.

    PBW, as part of its investment banking business, is continually engaged in
the valuation of businesses and corporate securities in connection with mergers,
acquisitions, company sales, business divestitures and valuations for estate,
corporate and other purposes. Under the engagement letter signed by PBW and
Datron, as amended, Datron has agreed to pay PBW: (a) a retainer of $6,000 per
month, (b) a transaction fee equivalent to 1% of the consideration paid for the
total equity of Datron less any retainer fees paid after February 2001, payable
upon the closing of such transactions and (c)

PBW's reasonable out-of-pocket expenses. Datron has also agreed to indemnify PBW
against liabilities, including defense expenses, arising out of PBW's
engagement.

TITAN'S REASONS FOR THE EXCHANGE OFFER AND THE MERGER

    Titan believes a business combination with Datron will advance its strategic
objective of taking advantage through acquisitions of growth opportunities from
ongoing consolidation in the commercial and government telecommunications
industries. Titan expects the combination with Datron to offer the following
strategic benefits to Titan after the merger:

    - enhancement of Titan's government and commercial telecommunications
      business revenues;

    - expansion of Titan's government and commercial telecommunications customer
      bases;

    - broadening of Titan's capability to serve the government
      telecommunications industry and to compete for new projects;

    - enhancement of Titan's ability to create, build and launch
      technology-based businesses;

    - augmentation of Titan's employee base in the San Diego, CA area, where a
      significant portion of its defense business is conducted;

    - synergies between Datron's consumer products business, which is targeting
      the mobile broadband communications markets, and Titan's e-tenna
      subsidiary, a developer of unique radio frequency technologies for the
      wireless market; and

    - augmentation of Titan's presence in foreign countries, where Datron has
      unique expertise in securing foreign government customers.

    Titan's board of directors has determined that the merger is in the best
interests of Titan and its stockholders. In reaching its determination, Titan's
board of directors considered a number of factors, including the factors
discussed above and listed below. The conclusions reached by Titan's board of
directors with respect to the following factors supported its determination that
the transaction and the issuance of shares of Titan common stock in the exchange
offer and the merger were fair to, and in the best interests of, Titan and its
stockholders:

    - the judgment, advice and analysis of Titan's management with respect to
      the potential strategic, financial and operational benefits of the
      transaction, including management's favorable recommendation of the
      transaction, based in part on the business, technical, financial,
      accounting and legal due diligence investigations performed with respect
      to Datron;

    - the results of operations and financial condition of Titan and Datron; and

    - the terms of the merger agreement and related agreements, including the
      exchange ratio and structure, which were considered by both the board of
      directors and management of Titan to provide a fair and equitable basis
      for the transaction.

    Titan's board of directors also considered a number of potentially negative
factors in its deliberations concerning the transaction. The potentially
negative factors considered by Titan's board of directors included:

    - the risk that the transaction might not be completed in a timely manner or
      at all;

    - the potential dilutive effect on the Titan common stock price if revenue
      and earnings expectations of the combined company are not met;

    - the potential loss of key Datron employees critical to the ongoing success
      of the Datron products and to the successful integration of the Titan and
      Datron product lines;

    - the general difficulties of integrating products, technologies and
      companies; and

    - the other risks and uncertainties discussed above in the section entitled
      "RISK FACTORS" starting on page 22.

    The above discussion of information and factors considered by Titan's board
of directors is not intended to be exhaustive but is believed to include all
material factors considered by the board. In view of the wide variety of factors
considered by Titan's board of directors, the board did not find it practicable
to quantify or otherwise assign relative weight to the specific factors
considered. In addition, Titan's board did not reach any specific conclusion on
each factor considered, or any aspect of any particular factor, but conducted an
overall analysis of these factors.

    Individual members of Titan's board may have given different weight to
different factors. However, after taking into account all of the factors
described above, Titan's board of directors determined that the merger agreement
and the transaction were fair to, and in the best interests of, Titan and that
Titan should proceed with the transaction.

INTERESTS OF DATRON'S OFFICERS AND DIRECTORS IN THE TRANSACTION

    Certain of Datron's directors and officers may have interests in the
exchange offer and the merger that may be different from, or in addition to,
their interest as Datron stockholders. You should be aware of those interests
when considering the unanimous recommendation of the Datron board that Datron
stockholders accept the exchange offer.

    CERTAIN ARRANGEMENTS BETWEEN DATRON AND ITS EXECUTIVE OFFICERS, DIRECTORS
     AND AFFILIATES

    Datron is a party to an amended and restated employment agreement with David
A. Derby providing for Mr. Derby's services as President and Chief Executive
Officer of Datron pursuant to which he is currently paid an annual salary of
$275,000, with vacation, holidays, insurance and other benefits permitted under
policies established by the Datron board. Should Mr. Derby be involuntarily
terminated by Datron for any reason other than cause, he will receive a lump sum
payment equal to three times his then current annual salary. If a transaction
occurs which results in the stockholders of Datron prior to the transaction
holding less than 50% of the voting power of Datron after the transaction, or if
subsequent to an annual meeting at which the Datron board is elected, the
elected members of the Datron board cease to constitute a majority of the
members of the board then in office, either Datron or Mr. Derby may terminate
the employment agreement, and Mr. Derby will receive a lump sum payment equal to
three times his then current salary. If the exchange offer is consummated,
Mr. Derby will have the right to terminate the employment agreement and receive
the lump sum payment of three times his salary. The employment agreement also
provides that, upon an assignment of the employment agreement by Datron,
Mr. Derby has the right to terminate the employment agreement if any successor
entity is not acceptable to him. Datron may terminate the employment agreement
if Mr. Derby commits any material act of dishonesty in the discharge of his
duties.

    Datron is a party to a severance agreement with William L. Stephan, Datron's
Chief Financial Officer, that provides 12 months of severance pay through salary
continuation in the event Mr. Stephan is involuntarily terminated by Datron for
any reason other than cause. The severance agreement prohibits Mr. Stephan from
engaging in activities directly competing with Datron for 12 months after an
involuntary termination.

    Under Datron's 1988 Key Employee Stock Purchase Plan, Mr. Derby borrowed
$164,000 from Datron to acquire 25,000 shares of Datron common stock in 1988 by
executing and delivering a full recourse promissory note. The promissory note
provided an interest rate of 4.64% per annum and was repaid in full during
fiscal year 2001 by Mr. Derby's tender of 11,408 shares of Datron common stock
at the then market price of $14.375 per share.

    A resolution of the Datron board dated September 7, 1999, as amended,
authorized the establishment of a bonus pool by Datron upon the execution and
delivery of a definitive agreement for the sale or merger of Datron. The
September 7, 1999 board resolutions provide for payment in cash of one-half of
one percent of the total value of such transaction; 70% of such cash payment
will be paid to Mr. Stephan and 30% of such cash payment will be paid to Penny
Felicioni. The payments under the bonus pool will be payable at the effective
date of the merger.

    TREATMENT OF STOCK OPTIONS

    Datron grants stock options to its employees, officers and directors under
Datron's Amended and Restated 1985 Stock Option Plan and its Amended and
Restated 1995 Stock Option Plan, and issues purchase rights under Datron's
Employee Stock Purchase Plan. Datron directors and officers hold options to
purchase Datron common stock as set forth below.

    Under the merger agreement, at the completion of the exchange offer, each
option or right to purchase Datron common stock will be assumed by Titan and
will be converted into an option or right to purchase Titan common stock,
subject to appropriate adjustments to reflect the exchange ratio.

    In addition, on June 22, 2001, the Datron board adopted resolutions pursuant
to which, at the completion of the exchange offer, each option (including those
held by officers and directors of Datron) granted under Datron's option plans
which is not vested as of the completion of the exchange offer will become fully
vested and exercisable.

    INDEMNIFICATION AND RELATED ARRANGEMENTS

    Mr. Derby and Mr. Stephan (as well as Datron's other current and former
officers and directors) are parties to indemnification agreements with Datron in
substantially the form approved by the stockholders at the Datron 1992 annual
meeting. For a period of six years from the effective date of the merger, Titan
will, and will cause Datron, as the surviving corporation in the merger, to
fulfill and honor in all respects the obligations of Datron pursuant to the
provisions of any indemnification agreements between Datron and its directors or
officers in effect as of the effective date of the merger, and any
indemnification provision under Datron's certificate of incorporation or bylaws
as in effect on the date of the merger agreement for acts or omissions occurring
prior to the effective date of the merger.

    In addition, for a period of six years after the effective date of the
merger, the surviving corporation will provide directors' and officers'
liability insurance for Datron directors and officers on terms at least as
favorable as insurance maintained by Datron as of the date of the merger
agreement, for acts or omissions which occurred prior to the completion of the
exchange offer.

    In addition, for those officers and directors who continue as officers and
directors of Datron after the completion of the exchange offer, Titan will cause
Datron or the surviving corporation to observe the terms of their
indemnification agreements, and Titan will make payments under the
indemnification

agreements if such officers or directors have not been paid when due for acts or
omissions which occurred after the completion of the exchange offer. From and
after the completion of the exchange offer, Titan will also provide directors'
and officers' liability coverage for continuing directors and officers of Datron
with respect to acts or omissions after the completion of the exchange offer
under Titan's existing policy for its own directors and officers.

    The above summary of the terms of the indemnification arrangement of
Datron's directors and officers is qualified in its entirety by reference to
Section 5.6 of the merger agreement, which has been filed as ANNEX A hereto and
is incorporated herein by reference.

MANAGEMENT OF TITAN AFTER THE TRANSACTIONS

    The management of Titan after the transactions will remain unchanged.
Information about the current directors and executive officers of Titan can be
found in Titan's Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2000 which is
incorporated by reference into this prospectus. See "WHERE YOU CAN FIND MORE
INFORMATION."

MATERIAL FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSEQUENCES

    The following discussion sets forth the material U.S. federal income tax
considerations of the transaction to holders of shares of Datron common stock
who exchange their shares of Datron common stock for Titan shares in the
exchange offer and/or the merger. This discussion and the tax opinions described
below are based on the Code, applicable Treasury regulations, administrative
interpretations and court decisions in effect as of the date of this prospectus,
all of which may change, possibly with retroactive effect. Any such change could
alter the tax consequences described in this summary and the tax opinions.

    This discussion of material federal income tax consequences of the
transaction is not intended to provide a complete analysis or description of all
potential federal income tax consequences of the exchange offer and/or the
merger. It does not address all aspects of federal income taxation that may be
important to a holder of shares of Datron common stock in light of that
stockholder's particular circumstances or to a stockholder subject to special
rules, such as:

    - a foreign entity or an individual stockholder who is not a citizen or
      resident of the U.S.;

    - a financial institution or insurance company;

    - a tax-exempt organization;

    - a dealer or broker in securities;

    - a stockholder who is subject to the alternative minimum tax provisions of
      the Code;

    - a stockholder whose shares are qualified small business stock for purposes
      of Section 1202 of the Code;

    - a stockholder who holds shares of Datron common stock as part of a hedge,
      appreciated financial position, straddle, constructive sale or conversion
      transaction;

    - a stockholder who acquired shares of Datron common stock pursuant to the
      exercise of incentive stock options or who holds shares of Datron common
      stock that are subject to a substantial risk of forfeiture; or

    - a stockholder who does not hold shares of Datron common stock as capital
      assets.

    In addition, this discussion does not address any state, local or foreign
income tax or non-income tax consequences of the exchange offer and/or the
merger or of any transactions other than the exchange offer and the merger.
Titan urges holders of shares of Datron common stock to consult their

own tax advisors to determine the particular federal income tax or other tax
consequences to them of participation in the exchange offer and/or the merger.

    QUALIFICATION OF THE EXCHANGE OFFER AND THE MERGER AS A REORGANIZATION

    Subject to the assumptions and limitations discussed in such opinions, in
the opinion of Cooley Godward LLP, counsel to Titan (filed as Exhibit 8.1 to the
registration statement of which this prospectus is a part), and of Heller Ehrman
White & McAuliffe LLP, counsel to Datron (filed as Exhibit 8.2 to the
registration statement of which this prospectus is a part) the transaction will
be treated for federal income tax purposes as a reorganization within the
meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code if all of the following factual
assumptions (also referred to as the "supporting conditions") are met:

    - the exchange offer and the merger are completed under the current terms of
      the merger agreement;

    - the minimum tender condition for the exchange offer is satisfied; and

    - the merger is completed promptly after the exchange offer.

    The completion of the exchange offer is conditioned upon the receipt by
Titan and Datron of tax opinions to the above effect from Cooley Godward LLP and
Heller Ehrman White & McAuliffe LLP, respectively. These opinions, and the
opinions contained herein, are based upon representations and covenants made by
Titan and Datron, including representations in certificates of officers of Titan
and Datron to be delivered to tax counsel before completion of the exchange
offer, and upon certain assumptions, including the absence of changes in facts
or in law between the date of the completion of the exchange offer and the
completion of the merger. If any of those representations, covenants or
assumptions is inaccurate, the tax consequences of the transaction could differ
materially from those summarized below. In addition, the ability to satisfy the
supporting conditions depends in part on facts that will not be available before
the completion of the merger. There can be no assurance that the merger will be
completed, or that the supporting conditions will be satisfied. If the
supporting conditions are not satisfied, the opinions of Cooley Godward and
Heller Ehrman White & McAuliffe described above may not be relied upon.
Furthermore, Cooley Godward's and Heller Ehrman White & McAuliffe's opinions
represent only their best judgment of the tax consequences of the exchange offer
and the merger. Such opinions will neither bind the IRS nor preclude the IRS or
the courts from adopting a contrary position. Datron stockholders should be
aware that neither the IRS nor any court has ruled on the tax treatment of a
combination of transactions identical to the proposed transactions and no ruling
has been or will be requested from the IRS in connection with the transactions.
Accordingly, it is possible that the exchange offer and/or the merger may not
qualify as a reorganization, and the tax consequences of the transaction could
differ materially from those summarized below. See the section entitled "FEDERAL
INCOME TAX CONSEQUENCES IF THE EXCHANGE OFFER AND THE MERGER DO NOT QUALIFY AS A
REORGANIZATION."

    If the transaction qualifies as a tax-free reorganization as described
above, for federal income tax purposes:

    - A holder of shares of Datron common stock will not recognize any gain or
      loss on its exchange in the exchange offer or the merger of its shares of
      Datron common stock for Titan shares.

    - If a holder of shares of Datron common stock receives cash instead of
      fractional shares of Titan common stock, the stockholder will be required
      to recognize capital gain or loss, measured by the difference between the
      amount of cash received instead of that fraction of a share and the
      portion of the tax basis of that holder's shares of Datron common stock
      allocable to that fraction of a share. This gain or loss will be long-term
      capital gain or loss if the holder of shares of Datron common stock has
      held the shares of Datron common stock exchanged for that fraction of a
      Titan share for more than one year at the time the shares of Datron common
      stock

      are accepted in the exchange offer or at the completion of the merger, as
      the case may be. The deductibility of capital losses is subject to
      limitations for both individuals and corporations.

    - A holder of shares of Datron common stock will have a tax basis in the
      Titan shares received in the exchange offer or the merger equal to
      (1) the tax basis in the shares of Datron common stock surrendered by that
      stockholder in the exchange offer or the merger, reduced by (2) any tax
      basis in the shares of Datron common stock that is allocable to a fraction
      of a Titan share for which cash is received.

    - The holding period for Titan shares received in exchange for shares of
      Datron common stock in the exchange offer or the merger will include the
      holding period for shares of Datron common stock surrendered in the
      exchange offer or the merger.

    - Under specified circumstances, holders of shares of Datron common stock
      may be entitled to appraisal rights in connection with the merger. See the
      section entitled "APPRAISAL RIGHTS" below. Datron stockholders who
      exercise their appraisal rights under law and receive payment for all of
      their stock in cash and who do not own any Titan shares (either actually
      or constructively within the meaning of Section 318 of the Internal
      Revenue Code) will generally recognize capital gain or loss measured by
      the difference between the amount of cash received and the stockholder's
      basis in such stock. Other Datron stockholders who exercise their
      appraisal rights may be treated as if they had received a dividend,
      taxable as ordinary income. Holders of shares of Datron common stock that
      exercise appraisal rights are urged to consult their own tax advisors.

    - Datron will not recognize gain or loss as a result of the transaction.

    FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSEQUENCES IF THE EXCHANGE OFFER AND THE MERGER DO NOT
     QUALIFY AS A REORGANIZATION

    The tax consequences described above are based on factual assumptions,
representations and covenants, including the satisfaction of the supporting
conditions. If any of those factual assumptions, representations or covenants
are not satisfied or observed, or in the event of a contrary ruling by the IRS
or a court, the federal income tax consequences of the transaction to holders of
shares of Datron common stock could differ materially from those summarized
above in the section entitled "QUALIFICATION OF THE EXCHANGE OFFER AND THE
MERGER AS A REORGANIZATION." In that event, exchanges by Datron stockholders
pursuant to the exchange offer and/or the merger could be taxable transactions
for federal income tax purposes depending on the particular facts surrounding
the exchange offer and/or the merger, some of which may not be known until after
completion of the merger.

    If the exchange offer and/or the merger is taxable, each Datron stockholder
participating in the exchange offer and/or the merger, as applicable, will
recognize capital gain or loss, measured by the difference between the fair
market value of the Titan shares (together with any cash instead of fractional
shares of Titan common stock) received by the stockholder and the stockholder's
tax basis in the shares of Datron common stock surrendered. This gain or loss
will be long-term capital gain or loss if the stockholder had held the shares of
Datron common stock for more than one year at the time the shares of Datron
common stock are accepted in the exchange offer or at the completion of the
merger, as applicable.

    FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSEQUENCES IF THE MERGER IS NOT COMPLETED

    No opinion has been given concerning any tax consequences of the exchange
offer if the merger is not completed, or if the merger is not completed promptly
after the exchange offer. Except as described under this heading, if the merger
is not completed, exchanges pursuant to the exchange offer generally will be
taxable transactions for federal income tax purposes with the consequences
described above in the section entitled "FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSEQUENCES IF THE
EXCHANGE OFFER AND THE MERGER DO NOT QUALIFY AS A REORGANIZATION."

    Even if the merger is not completed, the exchange offer will still be
treated for federal income tax purposes as a reorganization within the meaning
of Section 368(a) of the Code so long as the following factual assumptions are
met:

    - Titan must acquire at least 80% of the shares of Datron common stock in
      the exchange offer;

    - any acquisition of additional shares of Datron common stock from other
      stockholders by Titan must not be for consideration other than Titan
      voting stock; and

    - the other representations and covenants made by Titan and Datron to Cooley
      Godward and Heller Ehrman White & McAuliffe must remain effective.

    Whether these factual assumptions will be satisfied will not be known at the
time of the exchange offer and there can be no assurances that the factual
assumptions will be satisfied.

    Titan urges each holder of shares of Datron common stock to consult his or
her own tax advisor to determine the particular U.S. federal, state or local or
foreign income or other tax consequences of participation in the exchange offer
and/or the merger.

    FEDERAL BACKUP WITHHOLDING; REPORTING

    To prevent backup federal income tax withholding with respect to cash, if
any, received pursuant to the exchange offer and/or the merger, you must either
provide the Exchange Agent with your correct taxpayer identification number and
certify whether you are subject to backup withholding of federal income tax by
completing the substitute Form W-9 included in the letter of transmittal or
establish a basis for exemption from backup withholding. Some stockholders
(including, among others, all corporations and some foreign individuals) are not
subject to these backup withholding and reporting requirements. In order for a
foreign person to qualify as an exempt recipient, the stockholder must generally
submit a Form W-8BEN, W-8ECI, W-8EXP or W-8IMY, as appropriate, signed under
penalty of perjury, attesting to that person's exempt status. Datron
stockholders who fail to provide their correct taxpayer identification numbers
and the appropriate certifications or to establish an exemption as described
above will be subject to backup withholding of 31% (30.5% as of August 7, 2001)
on cash amounts received in the exchange offer and/or the merger and may be
subject to a $50 penalty imposed by the IRS. If withholding is made and results
in an overpayment of taxes, a refund may be obtained. Cash amounts paid pursuant
to the exchange offer and/or the merger will be reported to the extent required
by the Code to Datron stockholders and the IRS.

    Each Datron stockholder who receives Titan common shares in the exchange
offer and/or the merger is required to file a statement with his, her or its
federal income tax return setting forth the stockholder's basis in the shares of
Datron common stock surrendered and the fair market value of Titan common shares
and the proceeds from the cash in lieu of fractional shares received in the
exchange offer and the merger and is required to retain permanent records of
these facts relating to the transaction.

ACCOUNTING TREATMENT

    The transaction described in this prospectus will be accounted for as a
"purchase," as that term is used under generally accepted accounting principles,
commonly referred to as "GAAP," for accounting and financial reporting purposes.
Datron will be treated as the acquired corporation for these purposes. Datron's
assets, liabilities and other items will be adjusted to their estimated fair
value at the completion of the merger and combined with the historical book
values of the assets and liabilities of Titan. Applicable income tax effects of
these adjustments will be included as a component of the combined company's
deferred tax asset or liability. On June 29, 2001, the Financial Accounting
Standards Board, or FASB, adopted changes to the method of accounting for
goodwill in a purchase transaction from capitalization and amortization against
earnings to capitalization and periodic

evaluation for impairment. The change is effective with respect to all business
combinations accounted as a purchase and completed after June 30, 2001. As a
result, unamortized goodwill resulting from this transaction will be reported as
an asset and not amortized against earnings unless it becomes impaired. For
further information concerning the amount of goodwill or other intangibles to be
recorded in connection with the merger and the amortization of that goodwill,
see the section entitled "NOTES TO UNAUDITED PRO FORMA CONDENSED COMBINED
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS" on page 102.

REGULATORY APPROVALS

    Other than clearance under the antitrust laws applicable to the transaction
which are described below, the Securities and Exchange Commission declaring the
registration statement on Form S-4 relating to this transaction effective and
the filing of a certificate of merger under Delaware law with respect to the
merger, Titan does not believe that any additional material governmental filings
are required with respect to the transaction.

    Titan and Datron have determined that no filing of a notification under the
HSR Act is required in connection with the exchange offer and the merger. At any
time before or after the completion of the exchange offer or the merger, either
the Antitrust Division of the U.S. Department of Justice or the Federal Trade
Commission could take any action under U.S. antitrust laws that it deems
necessary or desirable, including seeking to enjoin the completion of the
exchange offer or the merger or seeking the divestiture of substantial assets of
Titan or Datron. Private parties and state attorneys general may also bring
actions under U.S. antitrust laws depending on the circumstances. Although we
believe that neither the exchange offer nor the merger raises concerns under
U.S. antitrust laws, we can give no assurance that a challenge to the exchange
offer or the merger on antitrust grounds will not be made or, if a challenge is
made, that it would not be successful. Completion of the exchange offer may be
subject to compliance with a limited number of foreign antitrust regulations.
Any notifications required by any foreign jurisdictions will be filed in due
course.

APPROVAL OF THE MERGER

    Under Section 251 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, the approval of
the board of directors of a company and the affirmative vote of the holders of
at least a majority of its outstanding shares on the record date are required to
approve a merger and adopt a merger agreement. Datron's board of directors has
unanimously approved the merger.

    If, after completion of the exchange offer, Titan owns more than 50% but
less than 90% of the outstanding shares of Datron common stock, it would
complete the acquisition of the remaining outstanding shares of Datron common
stock through a vote of Datron stockholders with respect to the merger. Since
Titan will own a majority of the shares of Datron common stock on the record
date, it would have a sufficient number of shares of Datron common stock to
approve the merger without the affirmative vote of any other holder of shares of
Datron common stock and, therefore, approval of the merger by Datron
stockholders will be assured. Completion of the transaction in this manner is
referred to in this prospectus as a "long-form" merger.

    Under Section 253 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, a merger can
occur without a vote of Datron stockholders, referred to as a "short-form
merger," if, after completion of the exchange offer, as it may be extended and
including any subsequent offering period, Titan were to own at least 90% of the
outstanding shares of Datron common stock. If, after completion of the exchange
offer, as it may be extended and including any subsequent offering period, Titan
owns at least 90% of the outstanding shares of Datron common stock, Titan would
complete the acquisition of the remaining outstanding shares of Datron common
stock by completing a short-form merger.

AMENDMENT TO DATRON'S STOCKHOLDER RIGHTS PLAN

    In connection with the approval of the exchange offer and the merger by the
board of directors of Datron, Datron amended its Stockholder Rights Agreement,
dated September 5, 2000, with Mellon Investor Services LLC as a rights agent.
Pursuant to the amendment, none of the transactions contemplated in the merger
agreement, including the exchange offer and the merger, will result in any
obligation to the holders of rights by Titan, Gem Acquisition Corp. or Datron,
as the surviving corporation in the merger. If the merger is consummated in
accordance with the terms of the merger agreement, the Rights Agreement will
terminate as of the effective time of the merger.

APPRAISAL RIGHTS

    Datron stockholders do not have appraisal rights in connection with the
exchange offer.

    If Titan completes the exchange offer but, upon completion of the exchange
offer, as it may be extended and including any subsequent offering period, it
owns less than 90% of the outstanding shares of Datron common stock, Titan has
agreed to effect a long-form merger, as described above. Assuming that the
shares of Datron common stock remain listed on a national securities exchange or
are then quoted on the Nasdaq National Market or held of record by more than
2,000 holders, Datron stockholders who have not exchanged their shares of Datron
common stock in the exchange offer will not have appraisal rights in connection
with a long-form merger. However, if a long-form merger is consummated, and if,
on the date fixed to determine stockholders entitled to vote on the merger, the
shares of Datron common stock are (i) not listed on a national securities
exchange or quoted through the Nasdaq National Market or (ii) held of record by
less than 2,000 holders, you will have appraisal rights pursuant to the
provisions of Section 262 of the Delaware General Corporation Law as described
below.

    If Titan completes the exchange offer and, upon completion of the exchange
offer, as it may be extended and including any subsequent offering period, it
owns at least 90% of the outstanding shares of Datron common stock, Titan has
agreed to effect a short-form merger (as described above). Datron stockholders
at the time of a short-form merger will have the right under Section 262 of the
Delaware General Corporation Law to dissent and demand appraisal of their shares
of Datron common stock. Under Section 262, dissenting stockholders who comply
with the applicable statutory procedures under the Delaware General Corporation
Law will be entitled to receive a judicial determination of the fair value of
their shares of Datron common stock (exclusive of any element of value arising
from the accomplishment or expectation of the merger) and to receive payment of
this fair value in cash, together with a fair rate of interest, if any. In
Cede & Co. and Cinerama, Inc. v. Technicolor, Inc., the Supreme Court of the
State of Delaware construed Section 262 of the Delaware General Corporation Law
and held that the "accomplishment or expectation" exclusion from the calculation
of fair value described in the preceding sentence is narrow and is designed to
eliminate use of pro forma data and projections of a speculative variety
relating to the completion of a merger. The court held that it is appropriate to
include in the calculation of fair value any known elements of value. Titan
cannot assure you what methodology a court would use to determine fair value or
how a court would select which of the elements of value that are to be included
in its determination.

    If Datron stockholders have appraisal rights in connection with the merger,
they would have to comply with specific statutory provisions under Delaware law.
The following is a brief summary of the statutory procedures that must be
followed by a Datron stockholder in order to perfect appraisal rights under
Delaware law.

    THE FOLLOWING DISCUSSION IS NOT A COMPLETE STATEMENT OF THE DELAWARE LAW
PERTAINING TO APPRAISAL RIGHTS AND IS QUALIFIED IN ITS ENTIRETY BY THE FULL TEXT
OF SECTION 262 OF THE GENERAL CORPORATION LAW OF THE STATE OF DELAWARE WHICH IS
ATTACHED TO THIS PROSPECTUS AS ANNEX D. BECAUSE OF THE COMPLEXITY OF
SECTION 262 AND THE NEED TO STRICTLY COMPLY WITH VARIOUS TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS,
YOU SHOULD READ

ANNEX D IN ITS ENTIRETY. A PERSON HAVING A BENEFICIAL INTEREST IN SHARES OF
DATRON COMMON STOCK HELD OF RECORD IN THE NAME OF ANOTHER PERSON, SUCH AS A
BROKER OR NOMINEE, MUST ACT PROMPTLY TO CAUSE THE RECORD HOLDER TO FOLLOW THE
STEPS SUMMARIZED BELOW PROPERLY AND IN A TIMELY MANNER TO PERFECT APPRAISAL
RIGHTS.

    Under Section 262, where a merger is to be submitted for approval at a
meeting of stockholders, the corporation, not less than 20 days prior to the
meeting, must notify each of its stockholders entitled to appraisal rights that
such appraisal rights are available and include in such notice a copy of
Section 262.

    A holder of shares of Datron common stock wishing to exercise such holder's
appraisal rights:

    - must deliver to Datron, before the vote on the adoption of the merger
      agreement at the special meeting, a written demand for the appraisal of
      his or her shares, and

    - must not vote in favor of the adoption of the merger agreement.

    In order not to vote in favor of the adoption of the merger agreement, a
stockholder must either:

    - not return a proxy card and not vote in person in favor of the adoption of
      the merger agreement,

    - return a proxy card with the "Against" or "Abstain" box checked,

    - vote in person against the adoption of the merger agreement, or

    - register in person an abstention from the proposal to adopt the merger
      agreement.

    ALL WRITTEN DEMANDS FOR APPRAISAL PURSUANT TO SECTION 262 SHOULD BE SENT OR
DELIVERED TO DATRON SYSTEMS INCORPORATED AT 3030 ENTERPRISE COURT, VISTA, CA
92083, ATTENTION: SECRETARY.

    A holder of shares of Datron common stock wishing to exercise such holders'
appraisal rights must hold of record such shares on the date the written demand
for appraisal is made and must continue to hold such shares of record through
the effective time of the merger. A vote against the adoption of the merger
agreement will not in and of itself constitute a written demand for appraisal
satisfying the requirements of Section 262. The demand must reasonably inform
Datron of the identity of the holder as well as the intention of the holder to
demand an appraisal of the "fair value" of the shares held by such holder. A
stockholder's failure to make the written demand prior to the taking of the vote
on the adoption of the merger agreement at the special meeting of Datron
stockholders will constitute a waiver of appraisal rights.

    Only a holder of record of shares of Datron common stock is entitled to
assert appraisal rights for the shares of Datron common stock registered in that
holder's name. A demand for appraisal in respect of shares of Datron common
stock should be executed by or on behalf of the holder of record, fully and
correctly, as such holder's name appears on such holder's stock certificates,
and must state that such person intends thereby to demand appraisal of such
holder's shares of Datron common stock in connection with the merger. If the
shares of Datron common stock are owned of record in a fiduciary capacity, such
as by a trustee, guardian or custodian, execution of the demand should be made
in that capacity, and if the shares of Datron common stock are owned of record
by more than one person, as in a joint tenancy and tenancy in common, the demand
should be executed by or on behalf of all joint owners. An authorized agent,
including two or more joint owners, may execute a demand for appraisal on behalf
of a holder of record; however, the agent must identify the record owner or
owners and expressly disclose the fact that in executing the demand, the agent
is agent for such owner or owners. A record holder such as a broker who holds
shares of Datron common stock as nominee for several beneficial owners may
exercise appraisal rights with respect to the shares of Datron common stock held
for one or more beneficial owners while not exercising such rights with respect
to the shares of Datron common stock held for other beneficial owners. In such
case, however, the written demand

should set forth the number of shares of Datron common stock as to which
appraisal is sought, and where no number of shares of Datron common stock is
expressly mentioned the demand will be presumed to cover all shares of Datron
common stock held in the name of the record owner. Stockholders who hold their
shares of Datron common stock in brokerage accounts or other nominee forms and
who wish to exercise appraisal rights are urged to consult with their brokers to
determine the appropriate procedures for the making of a demand for appraisal by
such a nominee.

    Within 10 days after the effective time of the merger, the surviving
corporation must notify each holder of Datron common stock who has compiled with
Section 262 and who has not voted in favor of the adoption of the merger
agreement of the date that the merger has become effective. Within 120 days
after the effective time of the merger, the surviving corporation or any holder
of Datron common stock who has complied with Section 262 and is entitled to
appraisal rights under Section 262 may file a petition in the Delaware Court of
Chancery demanding a determination of the fair value of such holder's shares of
Datron common stock. The surviving corporation is under no obligation to and has
no present intention to file such a petition. Accordingly, it is the obligation
of the holders of Datron common stock to initiate all necessary action to
perfect their appraisal rights in respect of their shares of Datron common stock
within the time prescribed in Section 262.

    Within 120 days after the effective time of the merger, any holder of Datron
common stock who has complied with the requirements for exercise of appraisal
rights will be entitled, upon written request, to receive from the surviving
corporation a statement setting forth the aggregate number of shares not voted
in favor of the adoption of the merger agreement and with respect to which
demands for appraisal have been received and the aggregate number of holders of
such shares. Such statement must be mailed within 10 days after a written
request for the statement has been received by the surviving corporation or
within 10 days after the expiration of the period for delivery of demands for
appraisal, whichever is later.

    If a petition for an appraisal is timely filed by a holder of shares of
Datron common stock and a copy of the petition is served upon the surviving
corporation, the surviving corporation will then be obligated within 20 days to
file with the Delaware Register in Chancery a duly verified list containing the
names and addresses of all stockholders who have demanded an appraisal of their
shares and with whom agreements as to the value of their shares have not been
reached. After notice to such stockholders as required by the court, the
Delaware Court of Chancery is empowered to conduct a hearing on such petition to
determine those stockholders who have complied with Section 262 and who have
become entitled to appraisal rights under Section 262. The Delaware Court of
Chancery may require the holders of shares of Datron common stock who demanded
payment for their shares to submit their stock certificates to the Delaware
Register in Chancery for notation on the certificate of the pendency of the
appraisal proceeding. If any stockholder fails to comply with such direction,
the Delaware Court of Chancery may dismiss the proceedings as to such
stockholder.

    After determining the holders of Datron common stock entitled to appraisal,
the Delaware Court of Chancery will appraise the "fair value" of their shares of
Datron common stock, exclusive of any element of value arising from the
accomplishment or expectation of the merger, together with a fair rate of
interest, if any, to be paid upon the amount determined to be the fair value.
Holders of Datron common stock considering seeking appraisal should be aware
that the fair value of their shares of Datron common stock as so determined
could be more than, the same as or less than the consideration they would
receive pursuant to the merger if they did not seek appraisal of their shares of
Datron common stock and that investment banking opinions as to fairness from a
financial point of view are not necessarily opinions as to fair value under
Section 262. The Delaware Supreme Court has stated that proof of value by any
techniques or methods which are generally considered acceptable in the financial
community and otherwise admissible in court should be considered in the
appraisal proceedings. In addition, Delaware courts have decided that the
statutory appraisal remedy, depending on factual circumstances, may or may not
be a dissenter's exclusive remedy. The Delaware Court of

Chancery will also determine the amount of interest, if any, to be paid upon the
amounts to be received by persons whose shares of Datron common stock have been
appraised. The costs of the action may be determined by the court and taxed upon
the parties as the court deems equitable. The court may also order that all or a
portion of the expenses incurred by any stockholder in connection with an
appraisal, including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys' fees and the
fees and expenses of experts utilized in the appraisal proceeding, be charged
pro rata against the value of all the shares entitled to be appraised.

    Any holder of shares of Datron common stock who has duly demanded an
appraisal in compliance with Section 262 will not, after the effective time of
the merger, be entitled to vote the shares of Datron common stock subject to
such demand for any purpose or be entitled to the payment of dividends or other
distributions on those shares of Datron common stock (except dividends or other
distributions payable to holders of record of Datron common stock as of a record
date prior to the effective time of the merger).

    If any stockholder who demands appraisal of such holder's shares of Datron
common stock under Section 262 fails to perfect, or effectively withdraws or
loses, such holder's right to appraisal, the shares of Datron common stock of
such stockholder will be deemed to have been converted at the effective time of
the merger into the right to receive the merger consideration. A stockholder
will fail to perfect, or effectively lose or withdraw, such holder's right to
appraisal if no petition for appraisal is filed within 120 days after the
effective time of the merger, or if the stockholder delivers to the surviving
corporation a written withdrawal of such holder's demand for appraisal and an
acceptance of the merger, except that any such attempt to withdraw made more
than 60 days after the effective time of the merger will require the written
approval of the surviving corporation and, once a petition for appraisal is
filed, the appraisal proceeding may not be dismissed as to any holder absent
court approval.

    FAILURE TO FOLLOW THE STEPS REQUIRED BY SECTION 262 OF THE GENERAL
CORPORATION LAW OF THE STATE OF DELAWARE FOR PERFECTING APPRAISAL RIGHTS MAY
RESULT IN THE LOSS OF SUCH RIGHTS.

POSSIBLE EFFECTS OF THE EXCHANGE OFFER

    REDUCED LIQUIDITY OF DATRON COMMON STOCK; POSSIBLY NO LONGER INCLUDED FOR
     QUOTATION

    The tender and exchange of shares of Datron common stock pursuant to the
exchange offer will reduce the number of holders of shares of Datron common
stock and the number of shares of Datron common stock that might otherwise trade
publicly and could adversely affect the liquidity and market value of the
remaining shares of Datron common stock held by the public. Shares of Datron
common stock are included for listing and principally traded on the Nasdaq
National Market. Depending on the number of shares of Datron common stock
acquired pursuant to the exchange offer, following completion of the exchange
offer, shares of Datron common stock may no longer meet the requirements of the
Nasdaq National Market for continued listing. The requirements for continued
inclusion in the Nasdaq National Market, among other things, require that an
issuer have either:

    - at least 750,000 publicly held shares, held by at least 400 stockholders
      of round lots, with a market value of at least $5.0 million and net
      tangible assets of at least $4.0 million and at least two registered and
      active market makers for the shares; or

    - at least 1,100,000 publicly held shares, held by at least 400 stockholders
      of round lots, with a market value of at least $15.0 million and at least
      four registered and active market markers, and either:

       - a market capitalization of at least $50.0 million; or

       - total assets and total revenue of at least $50.0 million each for the
         most recently completed fiscal year or two of the last three most
         recently completed fiscal years.

    Even if the requirements for continued inclusion in the Nasdaq National
Market, or Nasdaq, are not satisfied, the shares might nevertheless continue to
be included in a different tier of Nasdaq with quotations published in the
Nasdaq "additional list" or in one of the "local lists," but if the number of
holders of the shares were to fall below 300, the number of publicly held shares
were to fall below 500,000 or there were not at least two registered and active
market makers for the shares, applicable Nasdaq rules provide that the shares
would no longer be "qualified" for Nasdaq reporting and Nasdaq would cease to
provide any quotations. Shares held directly or indirectly by directors,
officers or beneficial owners of more than 10% of the shares are not considered
as being publicly held for this purpose. If, following the completion of the
exchange offer, the shares of Datron no longer meet the requirements for
continued inclusion in the Nasdaq National Market or in any other tier of Nasdaq
and the shares are no longer included in the Nasdaq National Market or in any
other tier of Nasdaq, the market for shares of Datron common stock could be
adversely affected.

    If the shares of Datron common stock no longer meet the requirements for
continued inclusion in any tier of the Nasdaq, it is possible that the shares
would continue to trade in the over-the-counter market and that price quotations
would be reported by other sources. The extent of the public market for the
shares of Datron common stock and the availability of quotations for shares of
Datron common stock would, however, depend upon the number of holders of shares
remaining at that time, the interest in maintaining a market in shares of Datron
common stock on the part of securities firms, the possible termination of
registration of the shares under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as
described below, and other factors. Titan cannot predict whether the reduction
in the number of shares of Datron common stock that might otherwise trade
publicly would have an adverse or beneficial effect on the market price for, or
marketability of, the shares of Datron common stock.

    According to Datron, there were, as of July 30, 2001, approximately
2,758,257 shares of Datron common stock outstanding.

    STATUS AS "MARGIN SECURITIES"

    The shares of Datron common stock are presently "margin securities" under
the regulations of the Federal Reserve Board, which has the effect, among other
things, of allowing brokers to extend credit on the collateral of shares of
Datron common stock. Depending on factors similar to those described above with
respect to market quotations, following completion of the exchange offer, the
shares of Datron common stock may no longer constitute "margin securities" for
the purposes of the Federal Reserve Board's margin regulations, in which event
the shares of Datron common stock would not be eligible as collateral for margin
loans made by brokers.

    REGISTRATION UNDER THE SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934

    Shares of Datron common stock are currently registered under the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934. Datron can terminate that registration upon application to
the Securities and Exchange Commission if the outstanding shares are not listed
on a national securities exchange or if there are fewer than 300 holders of
record of shares of Datron common stock. After completion of the merger, Titan
intends to cause Datron to terminate the registration of Datron common stock
under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Termination of registration of the
shares of Datron common stock under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 would
reduce the information that Datron must furnish to its stockholders and to the
Securities and Exchange Commission and would make certain provisions of the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934, such as the short-swing profit recovery
provisions of Section 16(b) and the requirement of furnishing a proxy statement
in connection with stockholders meetings pursuant to Section 14(a) and the
related requirement of furnishing an annual report to stockholders, no longer
applicable with respect to shares of Datron common stock. In addition, if shares
of Datron common stock are no longer registered under the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934, the requirements of Rule 13e-3 under the Securities Exchange Act of
1934 with respect to "going-private" transactions

would no longer be applicable to Datron. Furthermore, the ability of
"affiliates" of Datron and persons holding "restricted securities" of Datron to
dispose of these securities pursuant to Rule 144 under the Securities Act of
1933 may be impaired or eliminated. If registration of the shares under the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934 were terminated, they would no longer be
eligible for Nasdaq reporting or for continued inclusion on the Federal Reserve
Board's list of "margin securities."

RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN TITAN AND DATRON

    Except for the Stockholder Tender Agreements or as otherwise described in
this prospectus, neither Titan nor, to the best of Titan's knowledge, any of its
directors, executive officers or other affiliates has any contract, arrangement,

securities of Datron, including, but not limited to, any contract, arrangement,
understanding or relationship concerning the transfer or the voting of any
securities, joint ventures, loan or option arrangements, puts or calls,
guaranties of loans, guaranties against loss or the giving or withholding of
proxies. Except as described in this prospectus, there have been no contacts,

best of Titan's knowledge, any of its directors, executive officers or other
affiliates on the one hand, and Datron or its affiliates, on the other hand,
concerning a merger, consolidation or acquisition, a tender offer or other
acquisition of securities, an election of directors, or a sale or other transfer
of a material amount of assets. Neither Titan nor, to the best of Titan's
knowledge, any of its directors, executive officers or other affiliates has
since January 1, 1996 had any transaction with Datron or any of its officers,
directors or affiliates that would require disclosure under the rules and
regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission applicable to the exchange
offer.

    Neither Titan nor, to the best of Titan's knowledge, any of its directors,
executive officers or other affiliates beneficially owns or has any right to
acquire, directly or indirectly, any shares of Datron common stock except
pursuant to the Stockholder Tender Agreements described in more detail in the
section "THE STOCKHOLDER TENDER AGREEMENTS."

    Neither Titan nor, to the best of Titan's knowledge, any of its directors,
executive officers or other affiliates has effected any transaction in shares of
Datron common stock during the past 60 days.

FEES AND EXPENSES

    Titan has retained D.F. King & Co., Inc. to act as Information Agent in
connection with the exchange offer. The Information Agent may contact holders of
shares of Datron common stock by mail, telephone, telex, telegraph, e-mail and
personal interview and may request brokers, dealers and other nominee
stockholders to forward material relating to the exchange offer to beneficial
owners of shares of Datron common stock. Titan has agreed to pay the Information
Agent reasonable and customary compensation for these services in addition to
reimbursing the Information Agent for its reasonable out-of-pocket expenses.
Titan has agreed to indemnify the Information Agent against certain liabilities
and expenses in connection with the exchange offer, including certain
liabilities under the U.S. federal securities laws.

    In addition, Titan has retained American Stock Transfer & Trust Company as
the Exchange Agent. Titan has agreed to pay the Exchange Agent reasonable and
customary compensation for its services in connection with the exchange offer,
has agreed to reimburse the Exchange Agent for its reasonable out-of-pocket
expenses and has agreed to indemnify the Exchange Agent against certain
liabilities and expenses, including certain liabilities under the U.S. federal
securities laws.

    Except as described above, Titan has not agreed to pay any fees or
commissions to any broker, dealer or other person for soliciting tenders of
shares of Datron common stock pursuant to the exchange offer. Titan has agreed
to reimburse brokers, dealers, commercial banks and trust companies and other
nominees, upon request, for customary clerical and mailing expenses incurred by
them in forwarding offering materials to their customers.

                     CERTAIN TERMS OF THE MERGER AGREEMENT

    The following description of the merger agreement describes the material
terms of the merger agreement. The complete text of the merger agreement is
attached as ANNEX A to this prospectus and is incorporated into this prospectus
by reference. All stockholders are urged to read the entire merger agreement
carefully.

THE EXCHANGE OFFER

    GENERALLY

    Under the terms of the merger agreement, Titan has commenced an exchange
offer for all outstanding shares of Datron common stock. In the exchange offer,
Titan is offering to exchange a fraction of a share of Titan common stock
computed through an exchange ratio for each share of Datron common stock that is
validly tendered and not properly withdrawn. For a description of the exchange
ratio, please see the section entitled "THE TRANSACTION--THE EXCHANGE RATIO."
The initial expiration date of the exchange offer is August 3, 2001, the
twentieth business day following its commencement. The initial expiration date
may be extended under certain circumstances.

    MANDATORY EXTENSION OF THE EXCHANGE OFFER

    Titan must extend the offer for one 10 business day period if, on August 3,
2001, there have not been validly tendered and not withdrawn a number of shares
of Datron common stock which, together with the shares of Datron common stock
then owned by Titan (if any), represents a majority of the total number of
shares of Datron common stock outstanding immediately prior to the expiration of
the initial offer period.

    OPTIONAL EXTENSIONS OF THE EXCHANGE OFFER

    If any condition to the exchange offer is not satisfied or, if permissible,
waived on any scheduled expiration date of the exchange offer, Titan may extend
the expiration date of the exchange offer for successive extension periods of
not more than 10 business days per extension, until all conditions to the
exchange offer are satisfied or, if permissible, waived, or until the merger
agreement is terminated in accordance with its terms. Titan has the right to
extend the exchange offer to the extent required by the applicable rules and
regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission, the New York Stock
Exchange, or the National Association of Securities Dealers.

    SUBSEQUENT OFFERING PERIOD

    Titan may elect to provide a subsequent offering period of 3 to 20 business
days after the acceptance of shares of Datron common stock in the exchange offer
if the requirements of Rule 14d-11 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934
have been met. You will not have the right to withdraw any shares of Datron
common stock that you tender during any subsequent offering period. Titan is
required to accept for exchange, and to deliver shares of Titan common stock in
exchange for, shares of Datron common stock that are validly tendered, promptly
after the shares of Datron common stock are tendered during any subsequent
offering period. If Titan elects to provide a subsequent offering period, it is
required to make a public announcement to that effect no later than 9:00 a.m.,
New York City time, on the next business day after the previously scheduled
expiration date of the exchange offer.

    PROMPT PAYMENT FOR SHARES OF DATRON COMMON STOCK IN THE EXCHANGE OFFER

    Subject to the terms of the exchange offer and the merger agreement and the
satisfaction (or waiver to the extent permitted) of the conditions to the
exchange offer, Titan is required to accept for exchange all shares of Datron
common stock validly tendered and not properly withdrawn pursuant to

the exchange offer promptly after the applicable expiration date of the exchange
offer, as it may be extended pursuant to the merger agreement, and is required
to exchange all accepted shares of Datron common stock promptly after
acceptance.

    Titan will not issue certificates representing fractional shares of its
common stock in the exchange offer. Instead, each tendering stockholder who
would otherwise be entitled to a fractional share (after aggregating all
fractional shares of Titan common stock that otherwise would be received by the
holder) will receive cash (rounded up to the nearest whole cent), without
interest, equal to the product obtained by multiplying:

    - that fraction of a share of Titan common stock to which such stockholder
      is entitled (after aggregating all fractional shares of Titan common stock
      that otherwise would be received by such stockholder), by

    - the closing sales price of one share of Titan common stock on the New York
      Stock Exchange Composite Transaction Tape (as reported in the Wall Street
      Journal or, if not reported therein, any other authoritative source) on
      the date Titan accepts shares for exchange in the offer.

COMPOSITION OF DATRON'S BOARD OF DIRECTORS AFTER THE EXCHANGE OFFER

    Upon the acceptance for payment of shares of Datron common stock pursuant to
the exchange offer, Titan will be entitled to designate four directors of
Datron. Under the terms of the merger agreement, Datron has agreed to take all
action reasonably necessary to cause Titan's designees to be elected or
appointed to Datron's board of directors. Until the completion of the merger,
Datron's board of directors is required to include at least three members,
referred to in this prospectus as the "continuing directors," who were directors
of Datron prior to the completion of the exchange offer. If, at any time prior
to the completion of the merger, the number of continuing directors is reduced
to fewer than three for any reason, the remaining and departing continuing
directors will be entitled to designate a person or persons to fill any vacancy.
If, however, Titan purchases 85% or more of Datron common stock in the offer,
the number of continuing directors will be one.

    The merger agreement provides that if Titan's designees are elected to
Datron's board of directors prior to the completion of the merger, the
affirmative vote of a majority of the continuing directors will be required for
Datron to:

    - amend or terminate the merger agreement or agree or consent to any
      amendment or termination of the merger agreement;

    - waive any of Datron's rights, benefits or remedies under the merger
      agreement;

    - extend the time for performance of Titan's obligations under the merger
      agreement; or

    - approve any other action by Datron that is reasonably likely to adversely
      affect the interests of the Datron stockholders (other than Titan, Gem
      Acquisition Corp. and their affiliates) with respect to the transactions
      contemplated by the merger agreement.

THE MERGER

    GENERALLY

    The merger agreement provides that following completion of the exchange
offer, Gem Acquisition Corp. will be merged with and into Datron. Upon
completion of the merger, Datron will continue as the "surviving corporation"
and will be a wholly-owned subsidiary of Titan.

    THE COMPLETION OF THE MERGER

    The merger will be completed and become effective when the certificate of
merger is filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware. Titan and
Datron anticipate that the merger will be completed no later than the third
business day after all of the conditions to the merger contained in the merger
agreement are satisfied or, where permissible, waived.

    MANNER AND BASIS OF CONVERTING SHARES OF DATRON COMMON STOCK IN THE MERGER

    Under the terms of the merger agreement, upon completion of the merger, each
share of Datron common stock will be converted into the right to receive shares
of Titan common stock at the same exchange ratio used in the exchange offer. The
merger consideration will not be payable in respect of shares of Datron common
stock held by Datron as treasury stock immediately prior to completion of the
merger, shares of Datron common stock owned by Titan immediately prior to the
completion of the merger or shares of Datron common stock for which appraisal
rights are exercised under Delaware law.

    Titan will not issue certificates representing fractional shares of its
common stock in the merger. Instead, each stockholder who would otherwise be
entitled to a fractional share (after aggregating all fractional shares of Titan
common stock that otherwise would be received by the stockholder) will receive
cash (rounded to the nearest whole cent), without interest, equal to the product
obtained by multiplying:

    - that fraction of a share of Titan common stock to which such stockholder
      is entitled (after aggregating all fractional shares of Titan common stock
      that otherwise would be received by such stockholder), by

    - the closing sales price of one share of Titan common stock on the New York
      Stock Exchange Composite Transaction Tape (as reported in the Wall Street
      Journal or, if not reported therein, any other authoritative source) on
      the trading day immediately preceding the date of completion of the
      merger.

    The merger agreement provides that, as soon as reasonably practicable after
the date of completion of the merger, the Exchange Agent will mail to each
record holder of a certificate or certificates, that, immediately prior to the
completion of the merger represented outstanding shares of Datron common stock,
a letter of transmittal and instructions for use in exchanging Datron common
stock certificates for Titan common stock certificates and cash for any
fractional share. In addition, the merger agreement contemplates that, as soon
as reasonably practicable after the Exchange Agent receives back from the record
holder of shares of Datron common stock the Datron common stock certificate, the
letter of transmittal and any other documents that are required by the letter of
transmittal, the Exchange Agent will mail to the record holder a certificate or
certificates representing the appropriate number of shares of Titan common stock
and an amount of cash for any fractional share. Additionally, record holders of
Datron common stock certificates may, at their option after the completion of
the merger, physically surrender their Datron common stock certificates in
person at the offices of the Exchange Agent listed on the back of this
prospectus for Titan common stock certificates and cash for any fractional
share.

    After the completion of the merger, until it is surrendered and exchanged,
each certificate that previously evidenced Datron common stock will be deemed to
evidence the right to receive shares of Titan common stock and the right to
receive cash instead of fractional shares of Titan common stock. Titan will not
pay dividends or other distributions on any shares of Titan common stock to be
issued in exchange for any Datron common stock certificate that is not
surrendered until the Datron common stock certificate is properly surrendered,
as provided in the merger agreement.

ASSUMPTION OF DATRON STOCK OPTIONS AND DATRON EMPLOYEE STOCK PURCHASE RIGHTS

    DATRON STOCK OPTIONS

    Each outstanding option to purchase or otherwise acquire shares of Datron
common stock, also referred to as a "Datron stock option," will become fully
vested and immediately exercisable upon the completion of the exchange offer.
Under the terms of the merger agreement, upon the completion of the exchange
offer, Titan will automatically assume each outstanding Datron stock option that
has been issued pursuant to Datron's 1985 Stock Option Plan, as amended, 1995
Stock Option Plan or otherwise, on the same terms and conditions as were
applicable to the Datron stock option prior to the completion of the exchange
offer. Titan has agreed that each Datron stock option that is assumed by Titan
will be exercisable for the number of shares of Titan common stock equal to the
product of the number of shares of Datron common stock that were issuable upon
the exercise of the Datron stock option immediately prior to the completion of
the exchange offer, multiplied by the exchange ratio (rounded down to the
nearest whole number of shares of Titan common stock). In addition, Titan has
agreed to set the exercise price per share for shares of Titan common stock
issuable under each assumed Datron stock option to be at the per share exercise
price at which the Datron stock option was exercisable immediately prior to the
completion of the exchange offer, divided by the exchange ratio (rounded up to
the nearest whole cent).

    DATRON EMPLOYEE STOCK PURCHASE RIGHTS

    Under the terms of the merger agreement, upon the completion of the exchange
offer, Titan will automatically assume each outstanding right to purchase or
otherwise acquire shares of Datron common stock, also referred to as a "Datron
purchase right," that has been issued pursuant to the Datron Employee Stock
Purchase Plan or otherwise, on the same terms and conditions as were applicable
to the Datron purchase right prior to the completion of the offer. Titan has
agreed to make each Datron purchase right that is assumed by Titan exercisable
for the number of shares of Titan common stock equal to the product of the
number of shares of Datron common stock that were issuable upon the exercise of
the Datron purchase right immediately prior to the completion of the offer,
multiplied by the exchange ratio (rounded down to the nearest whole number of
shares of Titan common stock). In addition, Titan has agreed to set the purchase
price per share for shares of Titan common stock issuable under each assumed
Datron purchase right to be at the per share purchase price at which the Datron
purchase right was exercisable immediately prior to the completion of the offer,
divided by the exchange ratio (rounded up to the nearest whole cent).

    The merger agreement provides that Datron will take all necessary or
required actions under Datron's Employee Stock Purchase Plan to ensure that,
except for the six-month offering beginning July 1, 2001, no additional
offerings will be authorized or commenced. Under the terms of the merger
agreement, immediately prior to the completion of the merger, the accumulated
payroll deductions of participants in the Datron Employee Stock Purchase Plan
for the July 1 offering will be used to purchase Titan common stock, and,
immediately thereafter, the Datron Employee Stock Purchase Plan will terminate.

    Titan has agreed to file one or more registration statements on Form S-8
with respect to the shares of Titan common stock issuable pursuant to the
assumed Datron stock options and Datron purchase rights no later than one
business day after the completion of the offer. Titan has agreed to use its
commercially reasonable efforts to maintain the effectiveness of the
registration statement on Form S-8 for so long as any assumed Datron stock
options or Datron purchase rights remain outstanding.

REASSUMPTION OF DATRON STOCK OPTIONS AND DATRON EMPLOYEE STOCK PURCHASE RIGHTS
  BY DATRON

    The merger agreement contemplates that if, at any time after completion of
the offer, Titan directly or indirectly holds less than 50% of the total shares
of Datron common stock then outstanding, then, as of such time, Datron will
automatically without the action of any person reassume each outstanding former
Datron stock option and former Datron purchase right. Such former Datron stock
options and former Datron purchase rights will thereafter be exercisable for
Datron common stock on the same terms and conditions and at the same exercise or
purchase price as in existence immediately prior to Titan's assumption of such
options and rights.

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES

    The merger agreement contains a number of customary representations and
warranties relating to, among other things, certain aspects of the respective
businesses and assets of each of the parties and their ability to complete the
transaction. The representations and warranties of each party will expire upon
completion of the merger.

CONDUCT OF DATRON'S BUSINESS PRIOR TO COMPLETION OF THE EXCHANGE OFFER

    The merger agreement contemplates that, until the completion of the merger,
each of Datron and its subsidiaries will conduct its operations in the ordinary
course of business consistent with past practice and will use commercially
reasonable efforts to preserve intact its present business organization and its
relationships with customers, suppliers and others having business relationships
with it. The merger agreement also contemplates that, until completion of the
merger, neither Datron nor any of its subsidiaries will, without the prior
written consent of Titan:

COMMERCIALLY REASONABLE EFFORTS TO COMPLETE THE TRANSACTION

    Titan and Datron are required to make all filings required under antitrust
laws applicable to the transaction and to use commercially reasonable efforts to
take all actions necessary to complete the transaction.

LIMITATION ON DATRON'S ABILITY TO CONSIDER OTHER ACQUISITION PROPOSALS

    Datron has agreed that, except in the circumstances described below, it will
not, directly or indirectly:

    - solicit, initiate, encourage, induce or facilitate the making, submission
      or announcement of any Acquisition Proposal (as defined below) or take any
      action that could reasonably be expected to lead to an Acquisition
      Proposal;

    - furnish any information regarding Datron or its subsidiaries to any person
      (other than Titan or any designees of Titan) in connection with or in
      response to any Acquisition Proposal or an inquiry or indication of
      interest that could lead to an Acquisition Proposal;

    - engage in discussions or negotiations with any person (other than Titan or
      any designees of Titan) with respect to an Acquisition Proposal;

    - approve, endorse or recommend an Acquisition Proposal; or

    - enter into any letter of intent or similar document or any contract
      contemplating or otherwise relating to any Acquisition Proposal.

    However, Datron or Datron's board of directors is not prohibited from
furnishing nonpublic information regarding Datron or any subsidiary of Datron
to, or entering into discussions with, any person in response to a Superior
Proposal (as defined below) if:

    - Datron receives an unsolicited bona fide written Superior Proposal that is
      not withdrawn;

    - Datron's board of directors concludes in good faith, after consultation
      with Datron's outside legal counsel, that such action is required in order
      for Datron's board of directors to comply with its fiduciary obligations
      to Datron's stockholders under applicable law;

    - at least three business days prior to furnishing any nonpublic information
      to, or entering into discussions with, such person, Datron gives Titan
      written notice of the identity of the party making the Superior Proposal
      and of Datron's intention to furnish nonpublic information to, or enter
      into discussions with, such party;

    - at least two business days prior to furnishing any nonpublic information
      to the party making the Superior Proposal, Datron furnishes such nonpublic
      information to Titan (to the extent such nonpublic information has not
      been previously furnished by Datron to Titan); and

    - Datron receives from such party an executed confidentiality agreement
      containing customary limitations on the use and disclosure of all
      nonpublic written and oral information furnished to such party by or on
      behalf of Datron.

    Datron must promptly, and in any event within one business day, after
receipt of any Acquisition Proposal, inquiry or indication of interest that
could lead to an Acquisition Proposal or request for nonpublic information,
advise Titan orally and in writing of the proposal, inquiry or request, the
identity of the person making the proposal, inquiry or request and the terms
thereof. Datron must keep Titan fully informed as to the status of any such
Acquisition Proposal, inquiry, indication of interest or request and any
modification or proposed modification thereto.

    Under the terms of the merger agreement, Datron agreed to immediately cease
and cause to be terminated any existing discussions with any person that related
to any Acquisition Proposal.

    In addition, at any time prior to Titan's acceptance of the shares pursuant
to the exchange offer, Datron's board of directors may withhold, withdraw or
modify its recommendations that Datron stockholders accept the exchange offer
and approve and adopt the merger agreement if it determines, in good faith after
consultation with its outside legal counsel, that withholding, withdrawing or
modifying the recommendations is required in order for Datron's board of
directors to comply with its fiduciary obligations to Datron stockholders under
applicable legal requirements, or if:

    - an unsolicited, bona fide written offer is made to Datron by a third party
      for a merger, consolidation, business combination, sale of substantial
      assets, sale of shares of capital stock (including without limitation by
      way of a tender offer) or similar transaction, and such offer is not
      withdrawn;

    - Datron's board of directors determines in good faith (after consultation
      with Philpott Ball & Werner or another nationally recognized financial
      advisor) that such offer constitutes a Superior Proposal;

    - Datron's board of directors determines in good faith, based upon the
      advice of Datron's outside legal counsel, that, in light of the
      Acquisition Proposal, the withdrawal or modification of the
      recommendations is required in order for Datron's board of directors to
      comply with its fiduciary obligations to Datron's stockholders under
      applicable law;

    - the recommendations are not withdrawn or modified in a manner adverse to
      Titan at any time prior to five business days after Titan receives written
      notice from Datron confirming that Datron's board of directors has
      determined that such offer is a Superior Proposal and providing to Titan a
      copy of any such Superior Proposal;

    - Datron shall have released Titan from the provisions of any "standstill"
      or similar agreement restricting Titan from acquiring securities of
      Datron; and

    - neither Datron nor any of its representatives shall have violated any of
      the restrictions set forth above.

    Pursuant to the merger agreement, Datron has agreed not to release or permit
the release of any person (other than Titan) from, or waive or permit the waiver
of any provision of, any confidentiality, "standstill" or similar agreement
(other than as required pursuant to the terms of the relevant agreement) under
which Datron or any of its subsidiaries has any rights and will use reasonable
best efforts to enforce each such agreement if Titan should request that Datron
do so. Under the terms of the merger agreement, Datron has agreed to promptly
request each person that has executed, within 12 months prior to the merger
agreement, a confidentiality, standstill or similar agreement in connection with
an Acquisition Proposal to return all confidential information furnished to such
person by or on behalf of Datron.

    An "Acquisition Proposal" means any offer, proposal, inquiry or indication
of interest (other than an offer, proposal, inquiry or indication of interest by
Titan) contemplating or otherwise relating to any of the following:

    - any merger, consolidation, share exchange, business combination, issuance
      of securities, direct or indirect acquisition of securities, tender offer,
      exchange offer or other similar transaction in which Datron or any
      subsidiary of Datron is a constituent corporation, any person or "group"
      (as defined in the Exchange Act and the rules promulgated thereunder) of
      persons directly or indirectly acquires beneficial or record ownership of
      securities representing more than 20% of the outstanding securities of any
      class of voting securities of Datron or any subsidiary of Datron, or
      Datron, or any subsidiary of Datron, issues securities representing more
      than 20% of the outstanding securities of any class of its voting
      securities;

    - any direct or indirect sale, lease, exchange, transfer, license,
      acquisition or disposition of any business or businesses or of assets or
      rights that constitute or account for 20% or more of the consolidated net
      revenues, net income or assets of Datron or any subsidiary of Datron; or

    - any liquidation or dissolution of Datron or any subsidiary of Datron.

    A "Superior Proposal" means an unsolicited, bona fide written offer made by
a third party for a merger, consolidation, business combination, sale of
substantial assets, sale of shares of capital stock (including without
limitation by way of a tender offer) or similar transaction with respect to
Datron or any subsidiary of Datron on terms that the board of directors of
Datron determines, in good faith, after consultation with Philpott Ball & Werner
or another nationally recognized independent financial advisor, if accepted, is
reasonably likely to be consummated, taking into account all legal, financial
and regulatory aspects of the offer and the person making the offer, and would,
if consummated, be more favorable to Datron's stockholders, from a financial
point of view, than the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement.
However, any such offer shall not be deemed to be a "Superior Proposal" if any
financing required to consummate the transaction contemplated by such offer is
not committed or is not, in the good faith judgment of Datron, reasonably
capable of being obtained by such third party on a timely basis.

    The terms of the merger agreement do not prohibit Datron or Datron's board
of directors from taking and disclosing to Datron stockholders a position with
respect to a tender offer or an exchange offer by a third party, or from making
any disclosure required by applicable law. However, in connection with any
Acquisition Proposal, Datron's board of directors may not withhold, withdraw,
modify or change in a manner adverse to Titan, or fail to make, a recommendation
that Datron stockholders accept the exchange offer and approve and adopt the
merger agreement, and Datron's board of directors may not approve, endorse or
recommend any Acquisition Proposal, unless the conditions described above under
the caption "LIMITATION ON DATRON'S ABILITY TO CONSIDER OTHER ACQUISITION
PROPOSALS" are satisfied.

EMPLOYEE BENEFITS

    The merger agreement contemplates that the employees of Datron and any of
its subsidiaries who become and remain employees of Titan or any of its
subsidiaries after the completion of the merger will be eligible to continue to
participate in the surviving corporation's health, vacation and other employee
benefit plans. In the event Titan or the surviving corporation terminates any
such health, vacation or other employee plan at any time, such employees will be
eligible to participate in Titan's health, vacation or other employee benefit
plans to substantially the same extent as employees of Titan in similar
positions with the same seniority or years of service, and such seniority or
years of service with Datron will be recognized for eligibility and vesting
purposes.

CONDITIONS TO THE EXCHANGE OFFER

    The obligation of Titan to accept for exchange, and to deliver shares of
Titan common stock in exchange for, shares of Datron common stock that are
validly tendered and not properly withdrawn, is subject to the satisfaction or,
where permissible, the waiver of the conditions described in the merger
agreement. All conditions to the offer, other than those dependent upon receipt
of necessary governmental approvals, must be satisfied or waived before the
offer expires. The conditions to the offer include the following:

    THE MINIMUM TENDER CONDITION

    Prior to the expiration date of the exchange offer, as it may be extended
pursuant to the merger agreement, there must be validly tendered, in accordance
with the terms of the exchange offer, and not withdrawn a number of shares of
Datron common stock that, when added to any shares of Datron

common stock owned by Titan, is equal to at least a majority of the total number
of shares of Datron common stock outstanding immediately prior to the expiration
date of the exchange offer, as it may be extended pursuant to the merger
agreement.

    OTHER CONDITIONS TO THE EXCHANGE OFFER

    The exchange offer is also subject to the conditions that, prior to the
expiration of the exchange offer, as it may be extended pursuant to the merger
agreement:

    - the applicable waiting period under the HSR Act must have expired or been
      terminated;

    - any applicable waiting periods under foreign antitrust laws must have
      expired or been terminated and any required consents or clearances must
      have been obtained;

    - the registration statement on Form S-4 relating to this transaction must
      have been declared effective under the Securities Act of 1933, and must
      not be the subject of any stop order or proceedings seeking a stop order;

    - the shares of Titan common stock that are to be issued in the transaction
      must have been approved for listing on the New York Stock Exchange,
      subject to official notice of issuance;

    - Titan and Datron must have received opinions from their respective
      counsel, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to both, to the
      effect that the transaction will be a tax-free reorganization for federal
      income tax purposes, and the respective opinions must not have been
      subsequently rescinded; provided, however, if Titan's or Datron's counsel
      does not render such an opinion, or withdraws or modifies such opinion,
      this condition will be deemed satisfied if the other party's counsel
      renders such an opinion;

    - There must not be pending or threatened any legal proceeding in which a
      governmental body is:

       (1) challenging or seeking to restrain or prohibit the consummation of
           the offer or merger or any of the other transactions contemplated by
           the merger agreement;

       (2) seeking to obtain material damages from Titan or any subsidiary of
           Titan relating to the offer or the merger;

       (3) seeking to prohibit or limit in any material respect Titan's or any
           subsidiary of Titan's ability to vote, receive dividends with respect
           to or otherwise exercise ownership rights with respect to the shares
           of Datron common stock to be acquired in the offer or with respect to
           the stock of the surviving corporation;

       (4) which would materially and adversely affect the right of Titan, the
           surviving corporation or any of their respective subsidiaries to own
           the assets or operate the business of Datron or any subsidiary of
           Datron;

       (5) seeking to compel Datron, Titan or any of their respective
           subsidiaries to dispose of or hold separate any material assets as a
           result of the merger or any of the transactions contemplated by the
           merger agreement;

       (6) obligating Datron, Titan or any of their respective subsidiaries to
           pay material damages or otherwise become subject to material adverse
           consequences in connection with any of the transactions contemplated
           by the merger agreement; or

       (7) which would otherwise result in a material adverse effect on Datron
           or, as a result of the transactions contemplated by the merger
           agreement, a material adverse effect on Titan;

    - Datron must have not have materially breached any of its covenants,
      obligations or agreements under the merger agreement;

    - The representations and warranties of Datron contained in the merger
      agreement must have been true as of June 24, 2001 and must be true on and
      as of the date of the expiration of the exchange offer, as it may be
      extended pursuant to the merger agreement, with the same force and effect
      as if made as of such date, except:

       (1) in each case or in the aggregate, as does not constitute, and is not
           reasonably expected to result in, a material adverse effect on
           Datron;

       (2) for changes contemplated by the merger agreement; and

       (3) for those representations and warranties which address matters only
           as of a particular date, which representations must have been true
           (subject to the material adverse effect qualifications and
           limitations described above) as of such particular date;

    - The representations and warranties made by Datron regarding its
      capitalization must have been true in all respects as of June 24, 2001 and
      must be true on and as of the date of the expiration of the exchange
      offer, as it may be extended pursuant to the merger agreement, with the
      same force and effect as if made as of such date;

    - Except as disclosed to Titan by Datron, since December 31, 2000, there
      must not have been any material adverse effect on Datron or the occurrence
      of any event or circumstance that would reasonably be expected to have a
      material adverse effect on Datron; and

    - The merger agreement must not have been terminated in accordance with its
      terms.

    If any one of the above conditions is not met, and, in the good faith
judgment of Titan, it is inadvisable to proceed with the exchange offer or the
acceptance for exchange of, or the delivery of shares of Titan common stock in
exchange for, shares of Datron common stock, then Titan will not be required to
accept for exchange, or deliver any shares of Titan common stock in exchange
for, any shares of Datron common stock tendered.

    Titan reserves the absolute right, in its sole discretion, subject to the
terms of the merger agreement, to waive, in whole or in part, any of the
conditions to the exchange offer. However, the minimum tender condition, the
U.S. antitrust clearance condition, the conditions relating to the effectiveness
of the registration statement for the shares of Titan common stock to be issued
in the exchange offer and the listing of shares of Titan common stock on the New
York Stock Exchange and the condition that Datron must have received a tax
opinion from its legal counsel, as described above, may not be waived by Titan
without Datron's consent.

    As used in the merger agreement, "material adverse effect" as it relates to
Titan or Datron means a material adverse effect on or change in the financial
condition, business, assets or results of operations of Titan or Datron and
their respective subsidiaries, each taken as a whole, as the case may be.

CONDITIONS TO THE MERGER

    The obligations of Titan and Datron to complete the merger are subject to
the satisfaction or waiver of the following conditions:

    - if required by Delaware law, the merger agreement must have been adopted
      and approved by Datron stockholders;

    - Titan must have accepted for exchange, and delivered shares of Titan
      common stock in exchange for, all shares of Datron common stock that are
      validly tendered and not properly withdrawn pursuant to the exchange
      offer;

    - no provision of any applicable law or regulation and no judgment,
      injunction, order or decree prohibits the completion of the merger or the
      other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement; and

    - the registration statement on Form S-4 relating to the transaction,
      including any post-effective amendment thereto, must have become
      effective, and must not be the subject of any stop order or proceedings
      seeking a stop order, and any material "blue sky" or other state
      securities laws applicable to the registration and qualification of shares
      of Titan's common stock must have been complied with.

TERMINATION OF THE MERGER AGREEMENT

    TERMINATION BY MUTUAL AGREEMENT

    Titan and Datron may terminate the merger agreement at any time prior to the
completion of the merger by mutual written consent.

    TERMINATION BY EITHER TITAN OR DATRON

    Either Titan or Datron may terminate the merger agreement at any time prior
to the completion of the merger if:

    - the exchange offer has not been completed on or before August 31, 2001,
      except that the right to terminate the merger agreement for the reason
      identified in this paragraph is not available to any party whose action or
      failure to act has been a principal cause of the failure of the exchange
      offer to have been completed on or before such date if the action or
      failure to act constitutes a breach of the merger agreement;

    - the exchange offer expires or terminates in accordance with the terms of
      the merger agreement without Titan having accepted for exchange any shares
      of Datron common stock pursuant to the offer, except that the right to
      terminate the merger agreement for the reason identified in this paragraph
      is not available to any party whose action or failure to act has been a
      principal cause of the expiration or termination of the exchange offer
      without shares of Datron common stock having been accepted for exchange,
      if the action or failure to act constitutes a breach of the merger
      agreement; or

    - there is any applicable law or regulation that makes completion of the
      exchange offer or the merger illegal or otherwise prohibited, or any final
      and nonappealable judgment, injunction or order that prohibits the
      completion of the exchange offer or the merger.

    TERMINATION ARISING FROM STOCK PRICE MOVEMENTS

    Datron may terminate the merger agreement, at any time during the two-day
period commencing on (and including) July 27, 2001, if:

    - the average closing sales price of Titan common stock on the New York
      Stock Exchange Composite Transaction Tape, as reported in the Wall Street
      Journal, or, if not reported therein, any other authoritative source, for
      the 10-day trading period ending July 27, 2001 is less than $17.50;

    - Datron gives prompt written notice to Titan of its intent to terminate
      (which notice of election to terminate may be withdrawn by Datron at any
      time during the aforementioned two-day period pursuant to written notice
      provided by Datron to Titan); and

    - during the two-day period following the date on which Titan receives such
      notice, Titan does not provide notice to Datron of its election to
      continue the exchange offer using an exchange ratio equal to 90% of the
      price of Datron common stock divided by the average Titan closing price.

    Titan may terminate the merger agreement, at any time during the two-day
period commencing on (and including) July 27, 2001, if:

    - the average closing sales price of Titan common stock on the New York
      Stock Exchange Composite Transaction Tape, as reported in the Wall Street
      Journal, or, if not reported therein, any other authoritative source, for
      the 10-day trading period ending July 27, 2001, is greater than $27.50;

    - Titan gives prompt written notice to Datron of its intent to terminate
      (which notice of election to terminate may be withdrawn by Titan at any
      time during the aforementioned two-day period pursuant to written notice
      provided by Titan to Datron); and

    - during the two-day period following the date on which Datron receives such
      notice, Datron does not provide notice to Titan of its election to
      continue the terms of the merger agreement using an exchange ratio equal
      to 110% of the price of Datron common stock divided by the average Titan
      closing price.

    On July 27, 2001, Titan fixed the Titan common stock price for use in
computing the exchange ratio at $19.544, the average closing sales price for
shares of Titan common stock during the 10-day trading period ending July 27,
2001. Therefore, as of July 27, 2001, neither Titan nor Datron may terminate the
merger agreement because of stock price movements.

    TERMINATION BY TITAN

    Titan may terminate the merger agreement at any time prior to the acceptance
for exchange of shares of Datron common stock pursuant to the exchange offer, if
any of the following (a "Triggering Event") occurs:

    - Datron's board of directors fails to recommend that Datron stockholders
      accept the exchange offer and vote to approve the merger agreement;

    - Datron's board of directors withdraws, modifies or amends in any respect
      adverse to Titan its recommendation that Datron stockholders accept the
      exchange offer or its recommendation that Datron stockholders approve the
      merger agreement;

    - Datron's board of directors makes any disclosure to Datron stockholders or
      a public announcement that makes it reasonably apparent that, absent the
      restrictions described in the merger agreement, Datron's board of
      directors would withdraw, modify or amend in any respect adverse to Titan
      its recommendation that Datron stockholders accept the exchange offer or
      its recommendation that Datron stockholders approve the merger agreement;

    - Datron fails to include its recommendation that Datron stockholders accept
      the exchange offer or its recommendation that Datron stockholders approve
      the merger agreement in any of the offering documents;

    - Datron's board of directors fails to reaffirm in writing its
      recommendation that Datron stockholders accept the exchange offer or its
      recommendation that Datron stockholders approve the merger agreement, or
      fails to reaffirm in writing its determination that the offer and the
      merger are in the best interests of the Company's stockholders, within
      five business days after Titan requests in writing that such
      recommendation or determination be reaffirmed;

    - Datron's board of directors recommends, or resolves or announces an
      intention to recommend, any Acquisition Proposal to Datron stockholders;

    - Datron enters into any letter of intent or similar document or any
      contract relating to any Acquisition Proposal;

    - any tender offer or exchange offer (other than the exchange offer being
      made by Titan as described in this prospectus) relating to the outstanding
      shares of Datron common stock is announced or commenced and either
      Datron's board of directors recommends acceptance of the tender offer or
      exchange offer, or within 10 business days of the commencement of the
      tender offer or exchange offer, Datron's board of directors fails to
      recommend against approval of the tender offer or exchange offer by Datron
      stockholders;

    - an Acquisition Proposal is publicly announced, and Datron either fails to
      issue a press release announcing its opposition to such Acquisition
      Proposal within five business days after such Acquisition Proposal is
      announced or otherwise fails to actively oppose such Acquisition Proposal;
      or

    - there is a material breach of Datron's obligations described in the
      section entitled "LIMITATION ON DATRON'S ABILITY TO CONSIDER OTHER
      ACQUISITION PROPOSALS" above.

    In addition, Titan may terminate the merger agreement, at any time prior to
the acceptance for exchange of shares of Datron common stock pursuant to the
exchange offer, if:

    - Datron materially breaches any covenant or agreement in the merger
      agreement such that, pursuant to the terms of the merger agreement, Titan
      would not be required to accept for exchange any shares of Datron common
      stock tendered pursuant to the exchange offer if the expiration of the
      exchange offer had occurred on the date of the material breach; or

    - any representation or warranty of Datron was untrue when made or becomes
      untrue such that, pursuant to the terms of the merger agreement, Titan
      would not be required to accept for exchange any shares of Datron common
      stock tendered pursuant to the exchange offer if the expiration of the
      exchange offer had occurred on the date the untruth of the representation
      or warranty is communicated in writing to Datron by Titan.

    If, however, the breach of the covenant or agreement by Datron, or the
untruth of the representation or warranty of Datron, is curable by Datron
through the exercise of commercially reasonable efforts, then Titan may not
terminate the merger agreement until the earlier of 10 days after delivery of
written notice from Titan to Datron of the breach or untruth, or the date on
which Datron ceases to use reasonable best efforts to cure the breach or
untruth.

    TERMINATION BY DATRON

    Datron may terminate the merger agreement at any time prior to the
acceptance for exchange of shares of Datron common stock pursuant to the
exchange offer, if:

    - Titan materially breaches any covenant or agreement in the merger
      agreement;

    - any representation or warranty of Titan, which was not qualified by a
      "materiality" qualifier, was inaccurate in any material respect; or

    - any representation or warranty of Titan, which was qualified by a
      "materiality" qualifier, was inaccurate in any respect.

    If, however, the breach of the covenant or agreement by Titan, or the
inaccuracy of the representation or warranty of Titan, is curable by Titan
through the exercise of commercially reasonable efforts, then Datron may not
terminate the merger agreement until the earlier of 10 days after delivery of
written notice from Datron to Titan of the breach or untruth, or the date on
which Titan ceases to exercise reasonable best efforts to cure the breach or
untruth.

    If the merger agreement is terminated pursuant to any of the provisions
described above in this section, the merger agreement will become void and of no
effect, with no liability on the part of Titan or Datron, unless Titan
terminated the merger agreement because a Triggering Event has occurred or
certain circumstances exist pursuant to which the termination fee described
below may become payable. Under the terms of the merger agreement, if the merger
agreement is terminated by Titan because a Triggering Event occurred then,
within two days after such termination, Datron must make a non-refundable cash
payment to Titan, in addition to any termination fee due, in an amount equal to
the aggregate amount of all reasonably documented fees and expenses (including
all attorneys' fees, accountants' fees, financial advisory fees and filing fees)
that have been paid or that may become payable by or on behalf of Titan in
connection with the preparation and negotiation of the merger agreement and
otherwise in connection with the offer and the merger up to an aggregate amount
of $300,000.

TERMINATION FEE; EXPENSES

    Datron has agreed to pay to Titan a termination fee in an amount equal to
$2.0 million, if the merger agreement is terminated before shares of Datron
common stock are accepted for exchange pursuant to the exchange offer and any of
the following additional circumstances exist:

    - The merger agreement is terminated by Titan because a Triggering Event has
      occurred; or

    - The merger agreement is terminated by either Titan or Datron because the
      exchange offer expires or terminates in accordance with the terms of the
      merger agreement without Titan having accepted for exchange any shares of
      Datron common stock or the exchange offer has not been completed on or
      before August 31, 2001, if:

       (1) at or prior to the termination of the merger agreement, an
           Acquisition Proposal is disclosed, announced, commenced, submitted or
           made; and

       (2) within 12 months following the termination of the merger agreement,
           Datron enters into a definitive agreement related to, or consummates,
           an acquisition transaction with any person.

    The merger agreement provides that all expenses, other than any termination
fee, incurred in connection with the merger agreement and the transactions
contemplated by the merger agreement are to be paid by the party incurring such
expenses. However, Titan and Datron are required to share equally all fees and
expenses, other than attorneys' fees, incurred in connection with the filing,
printing and mailing of the registration statement of which this prospectus is a
part, the preliminary prospectus, the exchange offer documents, the
post-effective amendment to the registration statement, and any amendments or
supplements to the preceding documents (if required), the filing by any of the
parties to the merger agreement of reports and forms relating to the transaction
under the HSR Act and the filing of any notice or other document under any
applicable foreign antitrust law.

AMENDMENTS TO THE MERGER AGREEMENT

    The merger agreement may be amended, modified or waived by Titan's or
Datron's board of directors at any time (whether before or after adoption of the
merger agreement by Datron stockholders) if the amendment or waiver is in
writing and signed, in the case of an amendment, by Datron and Titan or, in the
case of a waiver, by the party against whom the waiver is to be effective.
However, after the adoption of the merger agreement by the stockholders of
Datron, if necessary, no amendment shall be made which by law requires further
approval of Datron stockholders without the further approval of Datron
stockholders. See the section entitled "CONDITIONS TO THE EXCHANGE OFFER" for
information regarding the right of Titan to waive conditions to the exchange
offer.

                       THE STOCKHOLDER TENDER AGREEMENTS

    The following description of the stockholder tender agreements describes the
material terms of the stockholder tender agreements. A complete form of
stockholder tender agreement is attached as ANNEX B to this prospectus and is
incorporated into this prospectus by reference. All stockholders are urged to
read the form of stockholder tender agreement carefully.

PARTIES TO THE STOCKHOLDER TENDER AGREEMENTS

    As an inducement for Titan to enter into the merger agreement, the following
directors and executive officers of Datron have entered into stockholder tender
agreements with Titan and granted Titan an irrevocable proxy with respect to the
shares of Datron common stock (and options, warrants and other rights to acquire
shares of Datron common stock) beneficially owned by them as of June 24, 2001 or
acquired by them after June 24, 2001: David A. Derby, Kent P. Ainsworth,
William L. Stephen, Don M. Lyle, Robert D. Sherer, Richard W. Flatow and
William A. Preston.

    Datron's directors and officers who have beneficial ownership of 82,509
shares of Datron common stock in the aggregate, which represented approximately
3.0% of the outstanding shares of Datron common stock as of July 30, 2001, have
agreed to tender and not withdraw their shares of Datron common stock in the
exchange offer. In addition, the officers and directors of Datron who are
parties to the stockholder tender agreements may be obligated to exercise vested
options to purchase up to 137,849 shares of Datron common stock in the
aggregate, representing approximately 5.0% of the outstanding shares of Datron
common stock as of July 30, 2001, and tender the shares issued upon exercise of
such options if and to the extent necessary to satisfy the minimum condition for
the exchange offer.

AGREEMENT TO TENDER

    Each stockholder who has signed a stockholder tender agreement has agreed
that, unless Titan requests otherwise, the stockholder will tender his shares of
Datron common stock in the exchange offer within 10 business days after the
commencement of the exchange offer and will not withdraw the shares so tendered.

AGREEMENT TO VOTE

    Each stockholder who has signed a stockholder tender agreement has agreed
that, until the earlier of the day when the merger is completed or the day when
the merger agreement is validly terminated pursuant to its terms, the
stockholder will vote, or cause his shares of Datron common stock to be voted:

    - against any action or agreement that would result in a breach of any
      representation, warranty, covenant or obligation of Datron in the merger
      agreement;

    - against any action or agreement that would cause any provision contained
      in Section 6 or ANNEX I of the merger agreement to not be satisfied; and

    - against the following actions (other than the offer, the merger and the
      transactions contemplated by the merger agreement): (i) any Datron
      Acquisition Proposal; (ii) any change in a majority of the members of the
      board of directors of Datron, other than any change contemplated by
      Section 1.3 of the merger agreement; or (iii) any other action which is
      intended to, or could reasonably be expected to, impede, interfere with,
      delay, postpone, discourage or adversely affect the consummation of the
      exchange offer, the merger or any of the other transactions contemplated
      by the merger agreement or the stockholder tender agreement.

    In addition, each stockholder who has signed a stockholder tender agreement
has agreed that, prior to the earlier of the day when the merger is completed or
the day when the merger agreement is validly terminated pursuant to its terms,
the stockholder will not enter into any agreement or understanding with any
person or vote or give instructions in any manner inconsistent with the
stockholder's agreement to vote, as described above.

AGREEMENT NOT TO TRANSFER

    Each stockholder who has signed a stockholder tender agreement has agreed
that the stockholder will not:

    - cause or permit any transfer of any of his shares of Datron common stock
      to be effected (other than pursuant to the offer);

    - tender any of his shares of Datron common stock to any person (other than
      Gem Acquisition Corp. and Titan); or

    - create or permit to exist any encumbrance with respect to any of his
      shares of Datron common stock (other than encumbrances which do not affect
      the right to tender his shares of Datron common stock pursuant to the
      exchange offer and encumbrances which do not affect, directly or
      indirectly, the right of Titan to vote his shares of Datron common stock).

OBLIGATION TO EXERCISE OPTIONS

    Each stockholder of Datron who signed a stockholder tender agreement has
agreed to immediately exercise options, warrants or other rights to acquire
shares of Datron common stock which are vested as of the date of the stockholder
tender agreement or which become vested prior to the offer acceptance time, also
referred to as the subject options, if:

    - the number of shares validly tendered and not properly withdrawn in
      accordance with the terms of the offer two business days prior to the
      expiration date of the offer, together with the shares then owned by Titan
      and Gem Acquisition Corp. (if any), also referred to as the tendered
      shares, do not satisfy the minimum condition for the exchange offer;

    - the aggregate number of shares of Datron common stock issuable upon
      exercise of the subject options owned collectively by the officers and
      directors of Datron who are parties to stockholder tender agreements,
      together with the tendered shares, would satisfy the minimum condition for
      the exchange offer; and

    - the subject options are considered to be "in the money."

    A subject option is considered to be "in the money" if the price of Titan
common stock multiplied by the exchange ratio exceeds the exercise price of the
subject option on the date the price is determined. At the request of the
stockholder in connection with any exercise of subject options pursuant to a
stockholder tender agreement, Titan or its designees will provide to such
stockholder a loan on commercially reasonable terms equal to the exercise price
of the subject options exercised pursuant to the stockholder tender agreement,
which loan will be secured solely by the shares of Datron common stock received
by such stockholder in such exercise of any subject options.

OTHER

    Each stockholder who has signed a stockholder tender agreement has agreed
not to exercise any rights to demand appraisal of any shares of Datron common
stock, which may arise with respect to the merger. All obligations under the
stockholder tender agreements terminate upon the earlier of the day when the
merger agreement is terminated, or the time when the exchange offer is accepted.

                         INFORMATION RELATING TO DATRON

OVERVIEW

    Datron provides products and services for emerging satellite and radio
communication markets. Datron is a leading supplier of tracking antenna products
that are designed to provide television, Internet and other broadband
communication connections to land, sea and air mobile markets. Datron's major
products are remote sensing satellite earth stations, satellite communication
systems, mobile satellite television reception systems, and voice and data
communication radios. Datron sells its products to commercial and governmental
markets worldwide including several U.S. government customers such as the U.S.
Department of Defense, or DoD. Datron was founded in 1969 and became an
independent publicly held corporation in 1985.

    Datron operates in two business segments through two subsidiaries:

    - Datron Advanced Technologies Inc., or DAT, which conducts Datron's Antenna
      and Imaging Systems business; and

    - Datron World Communications, or DWC, which conducts Datron's
      Communications Products business.

ANTENNA AND IMAGING SYSTEMS

    The Antenna and Imaging System business segment designs and manufactures
satellite communication systems, subsystems and antennas and sells them to
commercial and governmental customers worldwide, including the DoD. DAT's major
product lines are:

    - satellite tracking antenna systems used for telemetry, tracking and
      control, remote sensing and satellite communication purposes by government
      and commercial users; and

    - mobile broadband communication systems for airlines, military transports
      and mobile land and marine direct broadcast satellite, or DBS, television
      users.

    SATELLITE TRACKING ANTENNA SYSTEMS.  Datron supplies satellite communication
antenna systems and subsystems used to receive defense-related data and data
transmitted through satellites of other government and commercial organizations.
The stabilizing and automatic tracking capabilities of its antenna systems make
them particularly well-suited for use on ships, motor vehicles and other mobile
platforms. Over the past two decades, Datron has been a prime contractor and a
subcontractor for shipboard antenna systems used by the U.S. Navy. More
recently, Datron has been developing airborne antenna systems for the U.S. Air
Force.

    Telemetry, tracking and control systems monitor and control vehicles such as
satellites, missiles and aircraft. They receive radio telemetry signals
containing vehicle status information, engage in automatic tracking of the
vehicle so contact is maintained and transmit command signals so vehicle control
can be established and maintained.

    The remote sensing market is a subset of the broader earth observation
market. It involves using several types of satellites containing optical and
radar sensors in conjunction with ground antennas and data processing equipment
to produce images. The images are in the form of hard copy and/or digital data
that allow the user to study changes on the earth's surface or environment.
Applications include locating minerals, updating maps, forecasting weather,
monitoring crops, studying the environment, monitoring earth resources and
gathering economic or military intelligence. Datron offers its customers
complete remote sensing earth stations, including image processing capability.

    Datron previously designed and manufactured broad bandwidth microwave
antennas for the aerospace industry that are used on high performance aircraft,
missiles and space launch vehicles. Datron sold that product line in the third
quarter of fiscal 2001.

    MOBILE BROADBAND COMMUNICATION SYSTEMS.  Datron is a leading designer and
marketer of mobile broadband communication systems. In fiscal 1996, Datron
introduced its first DBS antenna product that allows a recreational vehicle
owner to receive DBS television from a parked vehicle at the touch of a button
by automatically locating the satellite. During fiscal 1997, Datron introduced
several additional DBS antenna products including systems for boats at anchor,
boats underway, and RVs and buses on the open road. Also during fiscal 1997,
Datron was first to demonstrate live DBS television on a commercial airliner,
and in fiscal 1998, was first to obtain Federal Aviation Administration
certification of an airborne DBS system designed for large business jets. In
fiscal 2000, Datron licensed the manufacturing rights to its DBS-2100T
tail-mounted antenna for business jets to Airshow Inc. and announced it intended
to concentrate its airborne efforts on the commercial airline market.

    CUSTOMERS AND MARKETING

    Sales of Antenna and Imaging Systems' products have historically been
concentrated with the DoD, which accounted for 24% of this business segment's
fiscal 2001 sales and 32% of its fiscal 2000 sales. Marketing and sales
activities for its DoD customers and other non-defense governmental agencies are
conducted by internal sales and engineering personnel. Most customers for the
remote sensing business are foreign government space and communications
agencies. Marketing and sales activities for those products are usually
conducted through independent sales representatives in Europe, South America and
Asia.

    Datron established a new distribution method to sell the mobile DBS
television systems to the consumer markets. Datron currently sells its DBS
products directly to dealers and original equipment manufacturers, as well as
through select distributors and agents. DAT's employees provide sales and
marketing support and installation training for the dealers.

    In fiscal 2001, the two largest companies seeking to provide broadband
communications to the airlines, Rockwell Collins and Boeing, awarded development
and study contracts to Datron. These companies intended to supply real-time,
high-speed Internet, video and other data to airline cabins and cockpits.
Rockwell Collins also placed an order with Datron for nine flight-test units.
However, in April 2001, Rockwell Collins announced it no longer intended to
participate in an In-Flight Network joint venture with News Corporation and
issued Datron a stop-work order on the contract for nine flight-test units.
Boeing remains committed to the market through its Connection by Boeing(SM)
service. Datron satisfactorily completed the Boeing study contract and maintains
an ongoing relationship with Boeing. Datron remains committed to this market,
but believes it will take longer to develop than originally anticipated.

    MANUFACTURING, ASSEMBLY AND SOURCES OF SUPPLY

    Datron's Antenna and Imaging Systems products are designed, manufactured and
assembled at facilities in Simi Valley, California. Datron purchases some
components and subsystems from subcontractors and vendors. Some of these items
are standard off-the-shelf components and others are fabricated to Datron
specifications. Datron also fabricates electronic assemblies from purchased
electronic components and circuit boards.

    Datron generally does not rely on a single source of supply for materials,
parts or components. However, once a subcontractor is selected to provide
components built to Datron's specifications, Datron is often dependent on that
subcontractor. If a subcontractor fails to perform Datron may not be able to
meet its required delivery schedules which could affect adversely its business.

COMMUNICATION PRODUCTS

    The Communication Products segment designs, manufactures and distributes
high frequency, or HF, radios and accessories for over-the-horizon radio
communications and very high frequency, or

VHF, radios and accessories for line-of-sight communications. Datron's HF radios
operate in the frequency range of 1.6 to 30 megahertz, where radio waves
generated from the transmitter reflect off the ionosphere back to the point of
receipt on earth. Datron's VHF radio products, which operate in the frequency
range of 30 to 88 megahertz, provide users high-quality transmission for
line-of-sight communications.

    In addition to its standard radios, Datron offers frequency hopping and
encryption options to its VHF product line and automatic link establishment
options to its HF product line. Frequency hopping is a technique that prevents
interruption or interception of radio signals by changing, at high speeds, the
frequency at which they are transmitted. This technology utilizes synchronized
mechanisms that ensure all radios in a network are synchronized and frequency
hop at the same time. Automatic link establishment, when used in HF radio
equipment, automatically determines the best available frequencies on which to
communicate.

    Datron offers a wide range of accessory products to complement the HF and
VHF product lines. These accessory products include antennas and antenna tuners,
power sources, amplifiers, remote control systems, modems, data communications
equipment and audio accessories.

    A substantial percentage of sales of Communication Products is concentrated
with a small number of customers. For example, in fiscal 2001, two Asian
customers accounted for 36% and 29% of this business segment's sales. In fiscal
2000, an African customer accounted for 44% of this business segment's sales and
a European customer accounted for 11% of its sales. In fiscal 1999, another
African customer accounted for 20% of this business segment's sales and an Asian
customer accounted for 13% of its sales. Because it is unusual to receive large
orders from the same customer in successive years, it is often necessary to find
new customers each year to replace the previous year's sales. To minimize the
impact fluctuating sales may have on Datron's operations, temporary employees
are used when practical.

    In March 2001, Datron introduced its new Guardian-TM- family of radios
intended to address the estimated $800.0 million federal public safety wireless
network, or PSWN, market, a domestic market Datron has not previously served.
The PSWN market is being driven by a federal government mandate that requires
all non-military VHF radios to comply with certain radio spectrum utilization
and interoperability standards by 2005. Although initial reaction from potential
customers to the Guardian radio has been positive, market acceptance of the
radio is uncertain.

    CUSTOMERS AND MARKETING

    Sales to foreign customers accounted for 96% of this business segment's
fiscal 2001 sales and 89% of its fiscal 2000 sales. Most of its international
customers are agencies of foreign governments that perform civil defense,
paramilitary and military operations, and foreign governmental agencies that
perform civilian tasks unrelated to military operations, such as civil aviation
agencies, drug interdiction agencies, embassies and disaster relief
organizations. Domestic customers are primarily various agencies of the U.S.
government, including the Drug Enforcement Administration and Department of
State.

    Datron's products are sold in over 80 countries by a network of independent
sales and service representatives, most of whom are non-exclusive sales agents
of Datron. These representatives provide both pre-sale and post-sale support.
Many of them operate service facilities that offer both warranty and long-term
maintenance of Datron's products. Sales are denominated in U.S. dollars.

    In addition to direct sales, Datron sometimes sells its radio products to
international suppliers of complementary equipment. It also sometimes licenses
the local manufacturing of its products to customers in certain countries. The
latter practice is usually followed where local regulations discourage the
importation of complete units.

    MANUFACTURING, ASSEMBLY AND SOURCES OF SUPPLY

    Communication products are designed and manufactured at Datron's facilities
in Vista, California. Datron engineers work closely with manufacturing and
marketing personnel to improve existing designs and to introduce new products
that meet the ever-changing demands of the marketplace. Datron purchases certain
electronic components, circuit boards and fabricated metal parts, and painting
and silk screening services. Other than when it licenses overseas manufacturing
for a particular local market, Datron performs most other manufacturing
functions necessary for the production of its products.

    Datron is generally not dependent on any single source of supply for the
manufacture of its communication products. Although only one supplier may be
used for certain parts, Datron believes that multiple sources are usually
available.

PATENTS, TRADEMARKS, COPYRIGHTS AND LICENSES

    Datron has applied for several patents related to its mobile broadband
products. However, Datron believes that patents are not generally a significant
factor in Datron's business and that the success of Datron depends primarily on
the technical competence and managerial and marketing ability of Datron's
personnel.

    DATRON-Registered Trademark- and design, TRANSWORLD-Registered Trademark-,
I2S-Registered Trademark-, PRI2SM-Registered Trademark-, OPEN
2000-Registered Trademark-, DBS-2000-Registered Trademark-,
DBS-2100-Registered Trademark-, DBS-2400-Registered Trademark-,

Guardian-TM-, DBS-5000-TM-, GSC-NET-TM-, First In Motion-TM-, Whisperdrive-TM-
and We Cover the Global Spectrum-TM- are trademarks of Datron by application for
registration with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office.

    Datron has obtained licenses for the VHF frequency hopping technology and
for the automatic link establishment technology used in Datron's VHF and HF
radio products, respectively. It has also obtained a license for certain
technology used in its Guardian radio.

EMPLOYEES

    Datron employed approximately 305 employees at the end of fiscal 2001
compared with approximately 334 employees at the end of fiscal 2000. A decrease
primarily in engineering and manufacturing personnel at the Antenna and Imaging
Systems business segment was partially offset by an increase in engineering
personnel at the Communication Products business segment.

    None of Datron's employees are covered by a collective bargaining agreement,
and Datron considers its employee relations to be good.

PROPERTIES

    Datron's DWC subsidiary leases approximately 70,000 square feet of office,
engineering and manufacturing space in Vista, California. The lease expires on
April 30, 2009 and contains a five-year renewal option. DWC's operations and
Datron's corporate headquarters are located at this facility.

    DAT owns through a subsidiary, Datron Resources Inc., a 110,000 square foot
office, engineering and manufacturing building located on a nine-acre site in
Simi Valley, California. DAT conducts operations from that facility.

    Datron considers its properties to be suitable and adequate for its present
needs. The facilities in Vista and Simi Valley are being fully utilized during a
single shift with the exception of approximately 5,000 square feet of
manufacturing space in the Vista facility, which is reserved for future growth.

LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

    Datron is not involved in any litigation that is expected to have a material
adverse effect on its business or consolidated financial position.

    In August 1992, DWC was named as defendant in a lawsuit filed by ATACS
Corporation, or ATACS, and AIRTACS Corporation, or AIRTACS, relating to a
contract to provide radio communication shelters. ATACS and AIRTACS contend that
DWC entered into an agreement to team with them on the contract and then
wrongfully failed to use them as subcontractors. They seek damages in excess of
$2.0 million. In rulings on May 28, 1997 and September 3, 1997, the court found
Trans World in breach of a teaming agreement and awarded ATACS and AIRTACS one
dollar in damages. On September 8, 1998, the appeals court affirmed the district
court's decision except as to the award of nominal damages, and remanded the
matter to the district court for further hearing on damages. On June 14, 2000,
the district court issued an order awarding ATACS and AIRTACS damages of $30,075
including prejudgment interest. On July 12, 2000, ATACS and AIRTACS appealed the
district court's judgment to the U.S. Court of Appeals. Datron believes that
final resolution of this matter will not materially affect the consolidated
financial position of Datron or its results of operations.

    In December 2000, DWC was named as defendant in a lawsuit filed by Jose
Maria Santos Ramos, an individual, and Tecserve (Private) Limited trading as
Vista Communications. In the lawsuit, plaintiffs allege that DWC breached a
representative agreement and that plaintiffs are entitled to payment of a
commission in the amount of $3,750,000 based on the alleged agreement. DWC
denies that it breached the agreement and/or that it owes any commissions to
plaintiffs. Datron believes that final resolution of this matter will not
materially affect the consolidated financial position of Datron or its results
of operations.

                  DATRON MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
                OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

    THIS MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS
OF OPERATIONS CONTAINS FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS. A VARIETY OF FACTORS COULD
CAUSE DATRON'S ACTUAL RESULTS TO DIFFER FROM THE ANTICIPATED RESULTS EXPRESSED
IN SUCH FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS. THESE INCLUDE, AMONG OTHERS, UNCERTAINTIES
STEMMING FROM THE DEPENDENCE OF DATRON ON FOREIGN SALES AND ON LARGE ORDERS FROM
A RELATIVELY SMALL NUMBER OF CUSTOMERS, RISKS RELATING TO THE DECLINE IN
DATRON'S TRADITIONAL DEFENSE BUSINESS AND DATRON'S EFFORTS TO DEVELOP AND MARKET
CONSUMER PRODUCTS, LACK OF TIMELY DEVELOPMENT OR CUSTOMER ACCEPTANCE OF NEW
PRODUCTS, CHANGES IN OR UNAVAILABILITY OF PRODUCTS AND SERVICES OFFERED BY
SATELLITE SERVICE PROVIDERS AND THEIR RELATED SUPPLIERS, WORLDWIDE ECONOMIC
DOWNTURNS AND CURRENCY DEVALUATIONS, RESTRICTIONS THAT MAY BE IMPOSED BY THE
U.S. GOVERNMENT ON THE EXPORT OF DATRON'S PRODUCTS, AND THE IMPACT OF
COMPETITION. FOR MORE INFORMATION, PLEASE REVIEW DATRON'S PERIODIC REPORTS UNDER
THE SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, THE
INVESTMENT CONSIDERATIONS SET FORTH IN DATRON'S ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K AND
OTHER PUBLICLY FILED DOCUMENTS. THE SAFE HARBOR PROVIDED IN THE PRIVATE
SECURITIES LITIGATION REFORM ACT OF 1995, BY ITS TERMS, DOES NOT APPLY TO THE
EXCHANGE OFFER.

OVERVIEW

    Datron provides products and services that address the needs of emerging
satellite and radio communication markets. Datron reports operations in two
business segments: Antenna and Imaging Systems and Communication Products.

    ANTENNA AND IMAGING SYSTEMS

    The Antenna and Imaging Systems business segment designs and manufactures
satellite communication systems, subsystems and antennas that are sold worldwide
to commercial and governmental customers, including the U.S. Department of
Defense. Its major product lines are (1) satellite tracking antenna systems used
for remote sensing, telemetry, tracking and control and satellite communication
purposes by government and commercial users, and (2) mobile broadband
communication systems for airlines, military transports and mobile land and
marine direct broadcast satellite, or DBS, television users. Fiscal 2001 sales
for this segment were $36,930,000, a 7% decrease from fiscal 2000 sales of
$39,756,000. Product line sales for this segment in fiscal 2001 and 2000 were as
follows:

    During fiscal 2000, the sale of a remote sensing system to an Asian customer
accounted for 13% of this segment's sales and 8% of consolidated sales.

    COMMUNICATION PRODUCTS

    The Communication Products business segment designs, manufactures and
distributes voice and data communication radios for worldwide military and
civilian purposes. At the end of fiscal 2001, it introduced a new radio
targeting the federal public safety wireless network, or PSWN, market, a market
it has not previously served. Fiscal 2001 sales for this segment were
$25,332,000, a 14% increase from fiscal 2000 sales of $22,131,000. Foreign
customers accounted for 96% of this segment's fiscal 2001 sales and 89% of
fiscal 2000 sales. During fiscal 2001, sales of radio products to two Asian
customers accounted for 36% and 29% of this segment's sales and collectively 26%
of consolidated

sales. During fiscal 2000, sales of radio products to an African customer
accounted for 44% of this segment's sales and 16% of consolidated sales.

    Consolidated sales for fiscal 2001 were $62,262,000, up slightly from fiscal
2000 consolidated sales of $61,887,000. The relatively flat sales were due to
higher sales of radio communication products, offset by lower sales of antenna
systems products. Net income for fiscal 2001 was $2,957,000, or $1.06 per
diluted share, compared with net income in fiscal 2000 of $2,504,000, or $0.92
per diluted share. The increase in net income was primarily due to a $2,801,000
pre-tax gain (approximately $1,685,000, or $0.60 per diluted share after-tax) on
the sale of Datron's microwave products line in the third quarter. Net income in
fiscal 2000 included a $1,050,000 pre-tax license fee (approximately $632,000,
or $0.23 per diluted share after-tax) received for manufacturing rights to
Datron's DBS-2100 antenna for business jets.

    You should read Datron's consolidated financial statements and notes thereto
that are included elsewhere in this prospectus on pages F-1 through F-19 in
conjunction with the following review.

    Sales of Antenna and Imaging Systems decreased $2,826,000, or 7%, in fiscal
2001 compared with fiscal 2000 sales. The decrease was primarily due to lower
sales of remote sensing satellite earth stations and the absence of microwave
product sales during the last five months of the fiscal year due to the sale of
that product line in November 2000. The decrease was partially offset by higher
sales of mobile broadband communication systems. Sales of Antenna and Imaging
Systems increased $672,000, or 2%, in fiscal 2000 compared with fiscal 1999
sales. The increase was due to higher sales of tracking antenna systems for
military and commercial customers and higher sales of DBS antenna products,
partially offset by lower sales of remote sensing satellite earth stations.
Remote sensing is currently an especially difficult market with fewer contracts
being awarded and increased competition for the remaining business, as several
service providers have suffered launch failures and delays. Datron has responded
by cutting costs at this business segment; however, softness in the remote
sensing market is expected to continue for at least two more quarters, which is
likely to result in reduced performance for Datron during the first half of
fiscal 2002.

    The gross profit percentage on Antenna and Imaging Systems' sales was 25.2%
in fiscal 2001 compared with 28.2% in fiscal 2000 and 29.0% in fiscal 1999. The
decrease in fiscal 2001 from fiscal

2000 was primarily due to a less favorable product mix and lower unit sales
prices. The decrease in fiscal 2000 from fiscal 1999 was primarily due to a less
favorable product mix in the fourth quarter and lower unit sales prices for DBS
products resulting from new competition.

    The operating income percentage on sales of Antenna and Imaging Systems'
products was 9.3% in fiscal 2001 compared with 6.9% in fiscal 2000 and 8.0% in
fiscal 1999. The increase in fiscal 2001 from fiscal 2000 was primarily due to
the gain on sale of the microwave products line, partially offset by lower gross
profits and higher administrative expenses. The decrease in fiscal 2000 from
fiscal 1999 was primarily due to lower gross profits and higher new product
development expenses, partially offset by lower selling expenses.

    Sales of Communication Products increased $3,201,000, or 14%, in fiscal 2001
compared with fiscal 2000 sales. The increase was due to higher order bookings
of traditional radio products. Sales of radio products to two Asian customers
accounted for $9,060,000 and $7,389,000, or collectively 65%, of this segment's
fiscal 2001 sales. Sales of Communication Products increased $2,131,000, or 11%,
in fiscal 2000 compared with fiscal 1999 sales. The increase was due to higher
order bookings in fiscal 2000, approximately half of which were received in the
fourth quarter. Sales of radio products to an African customer accounted for
$9,657,000, or 44%, of this segment's fiscal 2000 sales. One customer will often
account for a large percentage of this segment's annual sales, but it is unusual
to have large sales from the same customer in successive years. International
customers accounted for 96%, 89% and 93% of this segment's sales in fiscal 2001,
2000 and 1999, respectively. Orders from this international customer base are
subject to economic and political instability and often are delayed.
Additionally, in fiscal 2002 Datron will enter the federal PSWN market with its
new Guardian-TM- radio. This is a new domestic market for Datron and market
acceptance of the Guardian radio is uncertain. Datron's performance in fiscal
2002 will depend, in part, on successfully obtaining new international orders
and market acceptance of the Guardian radio.

    The gross profit percentage on Communication Products' sales was 34.0% in
fiscal 2001 compared with 35.4% in fiscal 2000 and 37.2% in fiscal 1999. The
decrease in fiscal 2001 from fiscal 2000 was primarily due to a less favorable
product mix. The decrease in fiscal 2000 from fiscal 1999 was primarily due to
higher labor costs.

    The operating income percentage on sales of Communication Products was 9.4%
in fiscal 2001 compared with 8.1% of sales in fiscal 2000 and 5.7% of sales in
fiscal 1999. The increase in fiscal 2001 compared with fiscal 2000 was primarily
due to lower selling, administrative and R&D expenses as a percentage of sales,
partially offset by lower gross margins. The increase in fiscal 2000 compared
with fiscal 1999 was primarily due to lower selling and administrative expenses
as a percentage of sales, partially offset by lower gross margins.

CONSOLIDATED EXPENSES

    Selling, general and administrative expenses were $12,567,000 in fiscal 2001
compared with $12,100,000 in fiscal 2000 and $12,610,000 in fiscal 1999. Fiscal
2001 SG&A expenses increased 4% from fiscal 2000 SG&A expenses primarily due to
higher administrative expenses at the Antenna and Imaging Systems business
segment and at the corporate office. Fiscal 2000 SG&A expenses decreased 4% from
fiscal 1999 SG&A expenses primarily due to lower selling expenses at both
business segments, partially offset by higher administrative expenses at the
Antenna and Imaging Systems business segment and higher expenses at the
corporate office.

    Research and development expenses were $3,993,000 in fiscal 2001 compared
with $3,960,000 in fiscal 2000 and $3,269,000 in fiscal 1999. Fiscal 2001 R&D
expenses increased slightly over fiscal 2000 expenses as higher spending on
development programs for new radio products was offset by lower spending on
development programs to improve mobile DBS products. Fiscal 2000 R&D expenses
increased 21% over fiscal 1999 expenses primarily due to higher spending on
development programs to improve mobile DBS products and to improve core tracking
antenna technologies.

    Interest expense was $212,000 in fiscal 2001 compared with $217,000 in
fiscal 2000 and $326,000 in fiscal 1999. The fiscal 2001 and 2000 interest
amounts represented payments on long-term debt. There were no borrowings against
Datron's revolving line of credit during those two fiscal years. The 33%
decrease in interest expense in fiscal 2000 compared with fiscal 1999 was due to
the absence of borrowings against Datron's revolving line of credit in fiscal
2000. See note 5 to the notes to Datron's consolidated financial statements
included elsewhere in this prospectus. Interest income in fiscal 2001 was
$405,000 compared with $194,000 in fiscal 2000 and $231,000 in fiscal 1999. The
109% increase in fiscal 2001 was the result of higher average cash balances.
Fiscal 2001 and 2000 interest income resulted from short term investments of
excess cash. Fiscal 1999 interest income included collection of interest on a
past due account and income from short term investments of excess cash.

    Other income in fiscal 2000 of $1,129,000 was primarily due to the payment
received for licensing the manufacturing rights to Datron's DBS-2100 antenna for
business jets.

    The effective income tax provision rates for fiscal 2001, 2000 and 1999 were
32.9%, 38.9% and 39.9%, respectively. The provision rate in fiscal 2001 was
lower than the rate in fiscal 2000 primarily because of a larger R&D tax credit
in fiscal 2001. The provision rate in fiscal 2000 was lower than the rate in
fiscal 1999 primarily due to the ability to use the R&D tax credit in fiscal
2000.

    The following table sets forth order backlog at March 31, 2001 and 2000.

    The 41% decrease in Antenna and Imaging Systems' backlog at March 31, 2001
compared with March 31, 2000 was primarily due to continued softness in the
markets for antenna systems and remote sensing earth stations and to the absence
of microwave product orders due to the sale of that product line in the third
quarter of fiscal 2001. As mentioned above, Datron has responded by cutting
costs at this business segment; however, because of the low beginning backlog
and softness in the remote sensing market that is expected to continue for at
least two more quarters, Datron expects reduced performance in the first half of
fiscal 2002.

    Communication Products' backlog at March 31, 2001 was 5% higher than at
March 31, 2000 due to a stronger market for traditional radio products, which
resulted in an 18% increase in bookings

during fiscal 2001 compared with fiscal 2000. This segment's business has
historically been driven by one or two large contracts each fiscal year. As a
result, financial performance from quarter-to-quarter is often uneven. Because
of a relatively low order backlog at March 31, 2001 compared with recent fiscal
year sales, fiscal 2002 financial performance in this segment is expected to be
driven by second half results, much as has been the case the previous two fiscal
years. Also, the second half may be heavily influenced by market acceptance of
the new Guardian radio for the federal PSWN market.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

    At March 31, 2001, working capital was $27,278,000 compared with $23,929,000
at March 31, 2000, an increase of $3,349,000 or 14%. Significant changes
affecting working capital during fiscal 2001 were as follows: accounts
receivable increased $6,994,000 due to strong fourth quarter sales; gain on sale
of product line was $2,801,000; accounts payable and accrued expenses decreased
$964,000 primarily due to lower commission accruals; and customer advances
increased $521,000. Datron had cash at March 31, 2001 of $8,380,000 compared
with $12,183,000 at March 31, 2000, a decrease of 31%. At March 31, 2001, Datron
had no borrowings against its revolving line of credit.

    Capital expenditures were $1,266,000 in fiscal 2001, a 2% decrease compared
with fiscal 2000 capital expenditures of $1,289,000. Capital expenditures in
fiscal 2002 are expected to be higher than fiscal 2001 expenditures due to
anticipated tooling requirements for new products.

    At March 31, 2001, Datron had a $13,000,000 revolving line of credit with
its bank. The line may be used for the issuance of letters of credit and for
direct working capital advances, of which $2,000,000 is restricted to working
capital and letters of credit required to finance non-military international
business. That portion of the line of credit expired on April 1, 2001. The
remaining $11,000,000 facility expires on April 1, 2002. In May 2001, Datron
entered into a $15,000,000 revolving line of credit with a new bank, replacing
the line of credit described above. The line of credit may be used for the
issuance of standby letters of credit up to $15,000,000 and working capital
advances up to $5,000,000 provided total credit extended does not exceed
$15,000,000. The line of credit expires on August 2, 2002 and is not subject to
a borrowing base formula. Datron believes its existing working capital,
anticipated future cash flows from operations and available credit with its bank
are sufficient to finance presently planned capital and working capital
requirements.

    Datron has never paid a cash dividend on its common stock and does not
anticipate doing so in the foreseeable future. Inflation and changing prices
have not had a significant impact on Datron's historical operations.

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

    Datron does not currently use derivative financial instruments for
speculative purposes that expose Datron to market risk. Datron is exposed to
cash flow and fair value risk due to changes in interest rates with respect to
its long-term debt. At March 31, 2001, Datron had outstanding a promissory note
to a life insurance company in the amount of $3,080,000 pursuant to a loan
agreement under which Datron borrowed $3,300,000 on August 7, 1998. The note is
secured by a deed of trust on Datron's Simi Valley facility and has a maturity
date of September 1, 2008. Monthly payments are calculated on a 20-year
amortization. Interest is payable at a rate of 6.76% per annum through
September 1, 2003, at which date the interest rate becomes variable and tied to
LIBOR, adjusting every quarter for the remainder of the term. On September 1,
2003, Datron may either prepay the note without penalty or accept the variable
rate provisions as determined at that time.

             UNAUDITED PRO FORMA CONDENSED COMBINED FINANCIAL DATA

    Titan's proposed acquisition of Datron will be accounted for as a purchase.
Titan has presented below unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial data
that reflects the proposed acquisition of Datron and is intended to give you a
better picture of what the businesses of Titan and Datron might have looked like
if the merger between the two companies had occurred on January 1, 2000, the
first day of the first period for which financial information is presented. The
unaudited pro forma combined statements of operations combine the Titan
consolidated statement of operations data for the year ended December 31, 2000
and for the three months ended March 31, 2001 with the Datron consolidated
statements of operations for the year ended March 31, 2001 and for the three
months ended March 31, 2001, respectively, to reflect the proposed acquisition
of Datron by Titan. The unaudited pro forma condensed combined statements of
operations are not necessarily indicative of the results that would have
occurred had the proposed acquisition been consummated at the beginning of the
periods presented or the results that may be attained in the future.

    The unaudited pro forma condensed combined balance sheet has been prepared
as of March 31, 2001, giving effect to the acquisition of Datron by Titan as
though it had been consummated on that date.

             THE TITAN CORPORATION AND DATRON SYSTEMS INCORPORATED
      NOTES TO UNAUDITED PRO FORMA CONDENSED COMBINED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
                    (IN THOUSANDS, EXCEPT SHARE INFORMATION)

NOTE 1.  BASIS OF PRESENTATION

    The accompanying unaudited pro forma condensed combined statements of
operations combine the consolidated statements of operations of Titan for the
year ended December 31, 2000 and for the three months ended March 31, 2001 with
the consolidated statements of operations of Datron for the year ended
March 31, 2001 and for the three months ended March 31, 2001, respectively, to
reflect the proposed acquisition of Datron by Titan.

    The unaudited pro forma condensed combined statements of operations assume
the proposed acquisition was consummated at the beginning of the periods
presented. The unaudited pro forma condensed combined statements of operations
are not necessarily indicative of results that would have occurred had the
proposed acquisition been consummated at the beginning of the periods presented
or the results that may be attained in the future.

    The unaudited pro forma condensed combined balance sheet has been prepared
as of March 31, 2001, giving effect to the acquisition of Datron by Titan as
though it had been consummated on that date.

    Certain information normally included in financial statements prepared in
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles has been condensed or
omitted pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange
Commission. The pro forma condensed combined financial statements should be read
in conjunction with the historical consolidated financial statements of Titan
and the historical consolidated financial statements of Datron.

NOTE 2.  PRO FORMA ADJUSTMENTS

    (a) Record allocation of excess of Titan's purchase price over the fair
       value of the assets acquired, to goodwill and other intangibles. Upon
       completion of the proposed transaction, an independent valuation will be
       performed to determine the purchase price allocation based upon the fair
       value of the assets and liabilities acquired.

    (b) Record estimated other accrued liabilities arising as a result of the
       transaction as follows:

Employment termination agreements for Datron employees......   $2,400

    (c) Issue 2,561,000 shares, assuming 2,749,000 Datron shares outstanding and
       453,000 Datron stock options outstanding, assuming a $16 price per share
       paid for Datron shares and a ten-day average Titan stock price of $20,
       equivalent to an .80000 exchange ratio of Titan shares paid for each
       Datron share outstanding. Eliminate Datron common stock, capital in
       excess of par value, retained earnings and treasury stock as of
       March 31, 2001.

    (d) Record deferred compensation of $383 for all unvested Datron stock
       options based on the difference between the fair value on the date of
       consummation of the acquisition and the exercise price of the unvested
       Datron stock options, after giving effect to the exchange ratio described
       in Note (c) above. Amortization of deferred compensation of $128 and $32
       has been reflected in the pro forma condensed combined statements of
       operations for the year ended December 31, 2000 and the three months
       ended March 31, 2001, respectively.

    (f) Reflect the net change to the combined shares outstanding after
       calculating the number of shares to be issued by Titan in the transaction
       less the Datron shares currently outstanding, using the price and
       exchange assumptions described in Note (c) above.

                       DESCRIPTION OF TITAN CAPITAL STOCK

    The following description of Titan's capital stock does not constitute a
complete description of all the terms of Titan's capital stock and should be
read in conjunction with Titan's certificate of incorporation and bylaws which
have been filed by Titan with the SEC and are incorporated herein by reference.

    Titan's authorized capital stock as of June 30, 2001 consisted of:

    - 200,000,000 shares of common stock, par value $.01 per share, of which
      53,747,792 shares were issued and outstanding; and

    - 5,000,000 shares of preferred stock, par value $1.00 per share, of which
      1,068,102 shares have been designated as $1.00 cumulative convertible
      preferred stock, of which 689,978 shares were issued and outstanding, and
      1,000,000 shares have been designated as series A junior participating
      preferred stock, none of which is issued and outstanding.

    Titan has reserved for issuance under its 1990, 1994 and 1997 Stock Option
Plans, its 1996 Directors' Stock Option and Equity Participation Plan, and its
2000 Employee and Director Stock Option and Incentive Plan a total of 7,125,000
shares of Titan common stock, of which 4,632,841 shares were covered by
outstanding options as of June 30, 2001. Titan also has 1,000,000 shares of its
common stock reserved for issuance under Titan's Employee Stock Ownership Plan,
of which 460,024 shares were issued and outstanding as of June 30, 2001, and
2,000,000 shares of Titan common stock reserved for issuance under its Employee
Stock Purchase Plan and its 2000 Employee Stock Purchase Plan, of which 837,365
shares were issued and outstanding as of June 30, 2001.

    In addition, Titan recently filed a registration statement with the
Securities and Exchange Commission to register 8,048,685 shares of Titan common
stock that Titan may issue to the public, which amount includes the
underwriters' overallotment option. Titan stockholders also included 576,315
shares of Titan common stock on this registration statement that those
stockholders may sell to the public. On July 26, 2001, Titan announced a public
offering of 7,500,000 of the registered shares, which amount includes the
576,315 registered shares of Titan stockholders, at a public offering price of
$18 per share. Titan may sell an additional 1,125,000 registered shares to the
public if the underwriters exercise their overallotment option, which had not
occurred as of July 26, 2001. Titan expects the offering to close on July 31,
2001, subject to the satisfaction of customary closing conditions. To the extent
that Titan issues the shares of Titan common stock referred to above, your fully
diluted equity interest in Titan, based on the number of shares of Titan common
stock you receive in exchange for your Datron common shares pursuant to the
exchange offer and the merger, will be proportionately reduced.

    The following summary describes the material terms of Titan's capital stock
and stockholder rights plan. The description of capital stock and stockholder
rights plan is qualified by reference to Titan's certificate of incorporation,
as amended, bylaws and stockholder rights plan.

COMMON STOCK

    DIVIDENDS.  Subject to the right of the holders of any class of preferred
stock, holders of shares of Titan common stock are entitled to receive dividends
that may be declared by Titan's board of directors out of legally available
funds. No dividend may be declared or paid in cash or property on any share of
any class of common stock unless simultaneously the same dividend is declared or
paid on each share of that and every other class of common stock; provided,
that, in the event of stock dividends, holders of a specific class of common
stock shall be entitled to receive only additional shares of that class.

    VOTING RIGHTS.  The holders of Titan common stock are entitled to one vote
for each share held and do not have cumulative voting rights.

    LIQUIDATION RIGHTS.  Upon our liquidation, dissolution or winding-up, the
holders of Titan common stock are entitled to share ratably in all assets
available for distribution after payment in full to creditors and holders of
Titan preferred stock, if any.

    OTHER PROVISIONS.  The holders of Titan common stock are not entitled to
preemptive or similar rights.

PREFERRED STOCK

    Titan is currently authorized to issue 5,000,000 shares of preferred stock,
par value $1.00 per share, of which 1,068,102 shares have been previously issued
as $1.00 cumulative convertible preferred stock, of which 689,978 shares were
issued and outstanding as of June 30, 2001, and 1,000,000 shares have been
designated as series A junior participating preferred stock, none of which is
issued and outstanding. Titan's board of directors, in its sole discretion, may
designate and issue one or more series of preferred stock from Titan's
authorized and unissued shares of preferred stock. Subject to limitations
imposed by law or Titan's amended and restated articles of incorporation, the
board of directors is empowered to determine:

    - the designation of and the number of shares constituting a series of
      preferred stock;

    - the dividend rate, if any, for the series;

    - the terms and conditions of any voting and conversion rights for the
      series, if any;

    - the number of directors, if any, which the series shall be entitled to
      elect;

    - the amounts payable on the series upon Titan's liquidation, dissolution or
      winding-up;

    - the redemption prices and terms applicable to the series, if any; and

    - the preferences and relative rights among the series of preferred stock.

These rights, preferences, privileges and limitations of preferred stock could
adversely affect the rights of holders of Titan common stock.

CUMULATIVE CONVERTIBLE PREFERRED STOCK

    DIVIDENDS.  Each share of cumulative convertible preferred stock accrues
dividends at the rate of $1.00 per share per annum.

    VOTING RIGHTS.  The holders of Titan's cumulative convertible preferred
stock are entitled to one-third of one vote for each share held and do not have
cumulative voting rights.

    LIQUIDATION RIGHTS.  Upon Titan's liquidation, dissolution or winding-up,
the holders of Titan's cumulative convertible preferred stock are entitled to a
liquidation preference of $20 per share plus any unpaid cumulative dividends
before any distribution to holders of Titan common stock.

    CONVERSION RIGHTS.  Each outstanding share of cumulative convertible
preferred stock is convertible into Titan common stock, at the option of the
holder, at a rate of two-thirds shares of common stock for each share of
cumulative convertible preferred stock.

    REDEMPTION.  Each share of cumulative convertible preferred stock is
redeemable, but only at Titan's option, at a redemption price of $20 per share
plus any accrued and unpaid dividends.

    OTHER PROVISIONS.  The holders of Titan's cumulative convertible preferred
stock are not entitled to preemptive or similar rights.

CONVERTIBLE TRUST PREFERRED SECURITIES

    In February 2000, Titan Capital Trust, Titan's wholly-owned subsidiary,
issued 5,000,000 convertible preferred securities (Remarketable Term Income
Deferrable Equity Securities, or HIGH TIDES(sm)) at $50 per security. The
provisions of the HIGH TIDES issued by the trust are as follows:

    DISTRIBUTIONS.  The HIGH TIDES accrue distributions of 5 3/4% per annum,
payable quarterly in arrears. Titan may defer payment of the distributions for
up to 20 consecutive quarters so long as no event of default with respect to the
HIGH TIDES has occurred and is continuing. The trust's ability to pay
distributions on the HIGH TIDES is solely dependent on its receipt of interest
payments from Titan under debentures Titan issued to the trust in consideration
of its distribution to Titan of the proceeds of its issuance of the HIGH TIDES.
The 5 3/4% per annum rate may change on the reset date described below.

    REMARKETING.  Approximately 5 years after issuance of the HIGH TIDES, a
remarketing agent will attempt to establish an annual distribution rate,
conversion price and redemption features for the HIGH TIDES that are consistent
with a price per HIGH TIDES equal to 101% of its liquidation preference and that
are also most favorable to Titan. The remarketing of the HIGH TIDES will become
effective on the reset date, which is any date (1) not later than February 15,
2005, or, if the day is not a business day, the next succeeding day, and
(2) not earlier than 70 business days prior to February 15, 2005, as may be
determined by the remarketing agent in its sole discretion. On or after the
reset date, the applicable per annum distribution rate will be the term rate
established by the remarketing agent based on the outcome of the remarketing.

    CONVERSION RIGHTS.  Each HIGH TIDES is convertible into 1.0076 shares of
Titan common stock. On or after the reset date, the conversion rights of the
HIGH TIDES shall be those established in the remarketing.

    REDEMPTION RIGHTS.  The HIGH TIDES are redeemable by Titan at its option in
whole or in part beginning on February 20, 2003 at $50.72 per HIGH TIDE, which
redemption price declines to $50.00 per HIGH TIDE beginning February 20, 2004
and continues in effect until the remarketing is effected, after which date the
redemption features for the HIGH TIDES are those established in the remarketing.

    VOTING RIGHTS.  Holders of HIGH TIDES are not entitled to voting rights,
unless Titan defaults under the debentures Titan issued to the trust or Titan's
guarantee of the trust's obligations to distribute available funds held by the
trust to satisfy obligations under the HIGH TIDES, in which case the holders of
HIGH TIDES are entitled, by majority vote, to appoint an additional trustee of
the trust or remove other trustees.

    LIQUIDATION RIGHTS.  If the trust is liquidated and the debentures Titan
issued to the trust are not distributed to the holders of HIGH TIDES, the
holders are entitled to receive, after satisfaction of liabilities to creditors
of the trust as required by applicable law, $50 per HIGH TIDE plus accrued and
unpaid distributions.

PREFERRED SHARE PURCHASE RIGHTS

    Each outstanding share of Titan common stock has or will have attached to it
one preferred share purchase right, which Titan refers to as a right. Each right
entitles the registered holder of Titan common stock to purchase from Titan,
upon the occurrence of specified events, one one-hundredth of a share of Titan's
series A junior participating preferred stock, which Titan refers to as the
participating preferred shares, at a price of $42 per one one-hundredth of a
participating preferred share, subject to adjustment. The terms of the rights
are set forth in a rights agreement dated as of August 21, 1995, between Titan
and American Stock Transfer and Trust Company, as rights agent.

    Until the distribution date described below, Titan will not issue separate
certificates evidencing the rights. Until that date, the rights will be
evidenced, with respect to any common stock certificate, by that common stock
certificate. The rights will detach from the common stock and a distribution
date will occur upon the earlier of the following dates:

    - subject to the exceptions described below, the tenth day following a
      public announcement that an "acquiring person," which, subject to the
      exceptions listed in the following sentence, includes a person or "group"
      of affiliated or associated persons, has acquired, or obtained the right
      to acquire, beneficial ownership of 15% or more of Titan's outstanding
      common stock, or

    - the tenth day following the commencement, or the first public announcement
      by any person or group of an intention to commence, a tender offer or
      exchange offer that would result in beneficial ownership by a person or
      group of 15% or more of Titan's outstanding common stock.

    Titan's board of directors, with the concurrence of a majority of the
continuing directors, may postpone the distribution date by determining a later
distribution date before the time any person or group becomes an acquiring
person. Any board member who is not an acquiring person or an affiliate or
associate of an acquiring person, or an employee, director, representative,
nominee or designee of an acquiring person, or its affiliate or associate, but
who:

    - was a member of Titan's board of directors before any person becomes an
      acquiring person, or

    - became a member of Titan's board of directors after any person becomes an
      acquiring person if the member was nominated for election or elected to
      Titan's board of directors upon the recommendation or approval of a
      majority of the continuing directors, is considered to be a continuing
      director of Titan.

    The term "acquiring person" does not include Titan, any of its subsidiaries,
any of Titan's or its subsidiaries' employee benefit plans or any entity holding
Titan common stock for or under any of Titan's or its subsidiaries' employee
benefit plans. In addition, a person who would otherwise be an acquiring person
will not be considered an acquiring person if Titan's board of directors
determines in good faith that such person inadvertently became the beneficial
owner of 15% or more of Titan common stock and such person divests itself, as
promptly as practicable, of beneficial ownership of a sufficient number of
shares of Titan common stock so that it would no longer otherwise qualify as an
acquiring person.

    The rights agreement provides that, until the distribution date, or earlier
redemption or expiration of the rights, the rights will be transferred only with
Titan common stock. The rights will be evidenced, with respect to any common
stock certificate outstanding as of September 7, 1995, by that common stock
certificate with a summary of the rights attached to it. Until the distribution
date, or earlier redemption or expiration of the rights, new common stock
certificates issued after September 7, 1995, upon transfer or new issuances of
common stock will contain a notation incorporating the rights agreement by
reference. Until the distribution date, the surrender for transfer of any
certificates for common stock, even without a summary of the rights attached to
it, also will constitute the transfer of the rights associated with the common
stock represented by that certificate. As soon as practicable after the
distribution date, separate certificates evidencing the rights will be mailed to
holders of record of Titan common stock as of the close of business on the
distribution date, and the separate right certificates alone will evidence the
rights. Only Titan common stock issued before the distribution date will be
issued with rights.

    The rights are not exercisable until the distribution date. The rights will
expire on August 17, 2005, unless the expiration date is extended or unless the
rights are earlier redeemed or exchanged by Titan, in each case as described
below.

    The purchase price payable for the participating preferred shares, and the
number of participating preferred shares or other securities or property
issuable, upon exercise of the rights, as well as the

number of rights outstanding, are subject to adjustment from time to time to
prevent dilution in the following circumstances:

    - in the event of a stock dividend on, or a subdivision, combination or
      reclassification of the participating preferred shares,

    - upon the grant to holders of the participating preferred shares of rights
      or warrants to subscribe for or purchase participating preferred shares at
      a price, or securities convertible into participating preferred shares
      with a conversion price, less than the current market price of the
      participating preferred shares, or

    - upon the distribution to holders of the participating preferred shares of
      evidences of indebtedness, securities or assets, excluding regular
      periodic cash dividends at a rate not in excess of 125% of the last cash
      dividend paid or, in the case that regular cash dividends have not been
      paid, at a rate not in excess of 50% of the average net income per share
      of the four quarters ended immediately before the payment of the dividend,
      or dividends payable in participating preferred shares or of subscription
      rights or warrants, other than those referred to above.

    The number of outstanding rights and the number of one one-hundredths of a
participating preferred share issuable upon exercise of each right are also
subject to adjustment in the event of a dividend or other distribution on the
common stock payable in common stock or subdivisions, consolidations or
combinations of Titan common stock occurring, in any of those cases, before the
distribution date.

    Participating preferred shares purchasable upon exercise of the rights will
not be redeemable. Each participating preferred share will be entitled to a
minimum preferential quarterly dividend payment of $1.00 per share, but will be
entitled to an aggregate dividend of 100 times the dividend declared per share
of Titan common stock. If there is a liquidation, the holders of the
participating preferred shares will be entitled to a minimum preferential
liquidation payment of $100 per share, but will be entitled to an aggregate
payment of 100 times the payment made per share of Titan common stock. Each
participating preferred share will have 100 votes, voting together with Titan
common stock. If there is a merger, consolidation or other transaction in which
Titan common stock is exchanged, each participating preferred share will be
entitled to receive 100 times the amount received per share of Titan common
stock. These rights are protected by customary antidilution provisions.

    Because of the nature of the dividend, liquidation and voting rights of the
participating preferred shares, the value of the one one-hundredth interest in a
participating preferred share purchasable upon exercise of each right should
approximate the value of one share of Titan common stock.

    If any person or group becomes an acquiring person, except pursuant to
specified cash offers for all outstanding shares of Titan common stock approved
by Titan's board of directors, or if Titan is the surviving corporation in a
merger with an acquiring person or any affiliate or associate of an acquiring
person and Titan common stock is not changed or exchanged, proper provision will
be made so that each holder of a right, other than rights beneficially owned by
the acquiring person, which will become null and void, will have the right to
receive upon exercise of the right at the then-current market price, instead of
participating preferred shares, that number of shares of Titan common stock
having a market value of two times the exercise price of the right. If Titan
does not have sufficient common stock issued but not outstanding, or authorized
but unissued, to permit the exercise in full of the rights, Titan will be
required to take all action necessary to authorize additional common stock for
issuance upon exercise of the rights. If, after a good-faith effort, Titan is
unable to take all necessary action, Titan will substitute, for each share of
common stock that would otherwise be issuable upon exercise of a right, a number
of participating preferred shares, or fractional participating preferred shares,
with the same market value as that share of common stock.

    If, after a person or group has become an acquiring person, Titan is
acquired in a merger or other business combination transaction or 50% or more of
Titan's consolidated assets or earning power are sold, proper provision will be
made so that each holder of a right, other than rights beneficially owned by the
acquiring person, which will become null and void, will have the right to
receive, upon the exercise of the right at its then-current exercise price and
instead of participating preferred shares, that number of shares of common stock
of the acquiring company, or its parent, which at the time of the transaction
will have a market value of two times the exercise price of the right.

    The exercise price of a right at any date will be equal to the purchase
price at that date multiplied by the number of one one-hundredths of a
participating preferred share for which a right is exercisable at that date.

    At any time after any person or group becomes an acquiring person and before
the acquisition by that person or group of 50% or more of Titan's outstanding
common stock, Titan's board of directors may exchange the rights, in whole or in
part, for a number of shares of Titan common stock, per right, having an
aggregate value equal to the excess of the value of the shares of Titan common
stock issuable upon exercise of a right after a person or group becomes an
acquiring person over the purchase price, subject to adjustment. Titan's board
of directors will not exchange the rights owned by the acquiring person or
group, which will have become null and void.

    With specified exceptions, no adjustments in the purchase price for the
preferred shares will be required until cumulative adjustments require an
adjustment of at least 1% of that purchase price. No fractional participating
preferred shares will be issued, other than fractions which are integral
multiples of one one-hundredth of a participating preferred share, which may, at
Titan's election, be evidenced by depositary receipts. Instead of issuing
fractional participating preferred shares, Titan will make an adjustment in cash
based on the market price of the participating preferred shares on the last
trading day before the date of exercise.

    Upon approval by Titan's board of directors, Titan may redeem the rights, in
whole, but not in part, at a price of $.01 per right at any time until 10 days
following the public announcement that a person or group has become an acquiring
person. Titan's board of directors, with the concurrence of a majority of the
continuing directors, may extend the period during which the rights are
redeemable beyond the 10 days following the public announcement that a person or
group has become an acquiring person.

    Under circumstances described in the rights agreement, the decision to
redeem will require the concurrence of a majority of the continuing directors.
Immediately upon the determination of Titan's board of directors to redeem the
rights, Titan will make an announcement of the redemption. Upon the redemption,
the right to exercise the rights will terminate and the only right of right
holders will be to receive the redemption price.

    Until a right is exercised, the holder of the right, in the capacity of a
holder, will have no rights as a stockholder of Titan, including, without
limitation, the right to vote or to receive dividends. Although the distribution
of the rights will not be taxable to stockholders or to Titan, stockholders may,
depending upon the circumstances, recognize taxable income in the event that the
rights become exercisable for Titan common stock or other consideration, or for
common stock of the acquiring company or its parent as set forth above.

    Any of the provisions of the rights agreement may be amended or supplemented
by Titan's board of directors before the distribution date. From and after the
distribution date, Titan and the rights agent may amend or supplement the rights
agreement from time to time without the approval of any holders of rights:

    - to cure any ambiguity, to correct or supplement any defective or
      inconsistent provisions,

    - to shorten or lengthen any time period under the rights agreement relating
      to when the rights may be redeemed, so long as, under specified
      circumstances, a majority of the continuing directors approve the
      shortening or lengthening, or

    - to make any other provisions with respect to the rights which Titan and
      the rights agent may deem necessary or desirable.

    Notwithstanding this right to amend or supplement, from and after the
distribution date, the rights agreement may not be amended in any manner which
would adversely affect the interest of the holders of rights.

SECTION 203 OF THE DELAWARE GENERAL CORPORATION LAW

    Titan is subject to section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law,
which, with specified exceptions, prohibits a Delaware corporation from engaging
in any "business combination" with any "interested stockholder" for a period of
three years following the time that the stockholder became an interested
stockholder unless:

    - before that time, the board of directors of the corporation approved
      either the business combination or the transaction which resulted in the
      stockholder becoming an interested stockholder;

    - upon completion of the transaction which resulted in the stockholder
      becoming an interested stockholder, the interested stockholder owned at
      least 85% of the voting stock of the corporation outstanding at the time
      the transaction commenced, excluding for purposes of determining the
      number of shares outstanding those shares owned by persons who are
      directors and also officers and by employee stock plans in which employee
      participants do not have the right to determine confidentially whether
      shares held subject to the plan will be tendered in a tender or exchange
      offer; or

    - at or after that time, the business combination is approved by the board
      of directors and authorized at an annual or special meeting of
      stockholders, and not by written consent, by the affirmative vote of at
      least 66 2/3% of the outstanding voting stock which is not owned by the
      interested stockholder.

    Section 203 defines "business combination" to include the following:

    - any merger or consolidation of the corporation with the interested
      stockholder;

    - any sale, lease, exchange, mortgage, pledge, transfer or other disposition
      of 10% or more of the assets of the corporation involving the interested
      stockholder;

    - subject to specified exceptions, any transaction that results in the
      issuance or transfer by the corporation of any stock of the corporation to
      the interested stockholder;

    - any transaction involving the corporation that has the effect of
      increasing the proportionate share of the stock of any class or series of
      the corporation beneficially owned by the interested stockholder; or

    - any receipt by the interested stockholder of the benefit of any loans,
      advances, guarantees, pledges or other financial benefits provided by or
      through the corporation.

    In general, section 203 defines an "interested stockholder" as any entity or
person beneficially owning 15% or more of the outstanding voting stock of the
corporation or any entity or person affiliated with or controlling or controlled
by that entity or person.

TRANSFER AGENT AND REGISTRAR

    American Stock Transfer and Trust Company is the transfer agent and
registrar for Titan common stock.

        COMPARATIVE RIGHTS OF TITAN STOCKHOLDERS AND DATRON STOCKHOLDERS

    Datron is a Delaware corporation and a public company, and your rights as a
Datron stockholder are governed by the Delaware General Corporation Law and
Datron's certificate of incorporation, certificate of designation of Series A
Participating Cumulative Preferred Stock, certificate of designation of
Series RP Preferred Stock and amended and restated bylaws. Following the merger,
Datron stockholders will be common stockholders of Titan, which is a Delaware
corporation and a public company. Your rights as a Titan stockholder will
continue to be governed by the Delaware General Corporation Law, but also will
be governed by Titan's certificate of incorporation, bylaws and stockholder
rights agreement, which is referred to as the rights agreement. For more
information on Titan's organizational documents, see "DESCRIPTION OF TITAN
CAPITAL STOCK."

    Significant differences, which Titan and Datron believe are all the material
differences, between the rights of Titan stockholders and Datron stockholders
are summarized below. This summary is not an exhaustive list or detailed
description of the provisions discussed and is qualified in its entirety by
Titan's certificate of incorporation, bylaws and rights agreement, and Datron's
certificate of incorporation, certificate of designation of Series A
Participating Cumulative Preferred Stock, certificate of designation of
Series RP Preferred Stock and amended and restated bylaws, each of which you
should review carefully. Copies of these documents may be obtained as described
under "WHERE YOU CAN FIND MORE INFORMATION."

AUTHORIZED SHARES OF CAPITAL STOCK; DIVIDEND RIGHTS; OTHER DISTRIBUTIONS

    TITAN.  Titan's authorized capital stock currently consists of 200,000,000
shares of common stock, par value $.01 per share, and 5,000,000 shares of
preferred stock, par value $1.00 per share. Under Titan's certificate of
incorporation, Titan's board of directors currently has the authority, without
further action by Titan stockholders, to issue up to 2,931,898 authorized shares
of Titan preferred stock in one or more series and to fix the voting powers,
designations, preferences and the relative participating, optional or other
special rights and qualifications, limitations and restrictions of each series,
including dividend rights, conversion rights, voting rights, terms of
redemption, liquidation preferences and the number of shares constituting any
series. Of the authorized shares of Titan preferred stock, Titan's board of
directors has designated 1,000,000 shares as series A junior participating
preferred stock and 1,068,102 shares as $1.00 cumulative convertible preferred
stock. For additional information on Titan's capital stock, see "DESCRIPTION OF
TITAN CAPITAL STOCK."

    During the time that any series of Titan preferred stock is outstanding, if
the terms of the series so provide, no dividends may be declared or paid by
Titan's board of directors on Titan common stock, unless dividends on all
outstanding shares of the relevant class or series of Titan preferred stock for
the current and all past dividend periods have been declared and paid or
provision made for the payment of those dividends.

    DATRON.  Datron's authorized capital stock consists of 10,000,000 shares of
common stock, par value $.01 per share, and 2,000,000 shares of preferred stock,
par value $.01 per share, of which 100,000 shares are designated as Series A
Participating Cumulative Preferred Stock and 10,000 shares are designated as
Series RP Preferred Stock. No shares of Datron preferred stock are issued and
outstanding. Under Datron's certificate of incorporation, Datron's board of
directors currently has the authority, without further action by Datron
stockholders, to issue shares of preferred stock from time to time in one or
more series. Datron's board is authorized to determine and alter the rights,
preferences, privileges, and restrictions granted to or imposed upon any wholly
unissued series of shares of Preferred Stock and to increase or decrease the
number of shares of any such series subsequent to the issue of shares of that
series.

BUSINESS COMBINATIONS; SUPERMAJORITY VOTING REQUIREMENTS

    Titan and Datron are subject to Section 203 of the Delaware General
Corporation Law, which, with specified exceptions, prohibits a Delaware
corporation from engaging in any "business combination" with any "interested
stockholder" for a period of three years following the time that the stockholder
became an interested stockholder unless:

    - before that time, the board of directors of the corporation approved
      either the business combination or the transaction which resulted in the
      stockholder becoming an interested stockholder;

    - upon completion of the transaction which resulted in the stockholder
      becoming an interested stockholder, the interested stockholder owned at
      least 85% of the voting stock of the corporation outstanding at the time
      the transaction commenced, excluding for purposes of determining the
      number of shares outstanding those shares owned by persons who are
      directors and also officers and by employee stock plans in which employee
      participants do not have the right to determine confidentially whether
      shares held subject to the plan will be tendered in a tender or exchange
      offer; or

    - at or after that time, the business combination is approved by the board
      of directors and authorized at an annual or special meeting of
      stockholders, and not by written consent, by the affirmative vote of at
      least 66 2/3% of the outstanding voting stock which is not owned by the
      interested stockholder.

    Section 203 defines "business combination" to include the following:

    - any merger or consolidation of the corporation with the interested
      stockholder;

    - any sale, lease, exchange, mortgage, pledge, transfer or other disposition
      of 10% or more of the assets of the corporation involving the interested
      stockholder;

    - subject to specified exceptions, any transaction that results in the
      issuance or transfer by the corporation of any stock of the corporation to
      the interested stockholder;

    - any transaction involving the corporation that has the effect of
      increasing the proportionate share of the stock of any class or series of
      the corporation beneficially owned by the interested stockholder; or

    - any receipt by the interested stockholder of the benefit of any loans,
      advances, guarantees, pledges or other financial benefits provided by or
      through the corporation.

    In general, section 203 defines an "interested stockholder" as any entity or
person beneficially owning 15% or more of the outstanding voting stock of the
corporation or any entity or person affiliated with or controlling or controlled
by that entity or person.

    TITAN.  Titan's certificate of incorporation and bylaws do not have
supermajority or other special voting requirements for business combinations or
other transactions.

    DATRON.  Datron's certificate of incorporation and bylaws also do not have
supermajority or other special voting requirements for business combinations or
other transactions.

APPRAISAL RIGHTS

    TITAN.  Titan's certificate of incorporation does not provide for appraisal
rights other than those rights designated by the Delaware General Corporation
Law. The Delaware General Corporation Law provides for appraisal rights only in
the case of specified mergers or consolidations and not, unless the certificate
of incorporation of a corporation so provides, in the case of other mergers, a
sale or transfer of all or substantially all of its assets or an amendment to
its certificate of incorporation. In addition, the Delaware General Corporation
Law does not provide appraisal rights in connection with a merger or
consolidation, unless the certificate of incorporation of a corporation so
provides, to the holders of shares of a constituent corporation listed on a
national securities exchange, or designated as a national market system security
by the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc., or held of record by
more than 2,000 stockholders, unless the applicable agreement of merger or
consolidation requires the holders of those shares to receive, in exchange for
those shares, any property other than shares of stock of the resulting or
surviving corporation, shares of stock of any other corporation listed on a
national securities exchange or designated as described above, or held of record
by more than 2,000 holders, cash in lieu of fractional shares or any combination
of the foregoing. The Delaware General Corporation Law also denies appraisal
rights to the stockholders of the surviving corporation in a merger if such
merger did not require approval by the stockholders of the surviving
corporation.

    DATRON.  Datron's certification of incorporation does not provide for
appraisal rights other than those rights designated by the Delaware General
Corporation Law, as summarized above.

SPECIAL MEETINGS OF STOCKHOLDERS

    TITAN.  Titan's bylaws provide that special meetings may be called by Titan
pursuant to Titan's notice of meeting provisions. The stockholders of Titan do
not have the right to request or call a special meeting of stockholders, but a
stockholder may nominate persons for election as directors at a special meeting
called by Titan for the purpose of electing directors if the stockholder
complies with the advance notice provisions of the bylaws.

    DATRON.  The provisions in Datron's bylaws regarding special meetings of
stockholders are substantially the same as the Titan provisions described above.

STOCKHOLDER ACTION WITHOUT A MEETING

    TITAN.  Titan's bylaws provide that stockholder action may be taken by
written consent instead of a meeting, but only upon compliance with advance
notice and other procedural requirements specified in Titan's bylaws. Any Titan
stockholder of record seeking to have Titan's stockholders authorize or take
corporate action by written consent must, by written notice to Titan's
secretary, request Titan's board of

directors to fix a record date for the purpose of determining the stockholders
entitled to consent to the action in writing without a meeting. Within 10 days
of receiving the notice, Titan's board of directors must adopt a resolution
fixing the record date, which must not precede, or be more than 10 days after,
the date of the resolution. If the Titan board of directors does not fix a
record date in this manner, the record date:

    - when no prior action by the Titan board of directors is required by
      applicable law, will be the first date on which a signed written consent
      describing the action taken or proposed to be taken is delivered to Titan;
      or

    - when prior action by the Titan board of directors is required by
      applicable law, will be at the close of business on the date on which the
      Titan board of directors adopts the resolution taking the required action.

In addition, Titan's bylaws provide that no stockholder action by written
consent is effective until nationally recognized inspectors of election certify
to Titan that the consents properly delivered to Titan represent at least the
minimum number of votes that would be necessary to take the corporate action.
All stockholder consents must be properly delivered to Titan within 60 days of
the date that the earliest dated written consent was received by Titan.

    DATRON.  The provisions in Datron's bylaws regarding the procedures for
stockholders to take action by written consent without a meeting are
substantially the same as the Titan provisions described above.

STOCKHOLDER PROPOSAL PROCEDURES

    TITAN.  Titan's bylaws require that notice of proposals by stockholders to
be brought before any annual meeting must be delivered to Titan not later than
the 60th day nor earlier than the 90th day before the first anniversary of the
preceding year's annual meeting. If, however, the annual meeting is more than 30
days before or more than 60 days after the anniversary date, the notice must be
delivered not earlier than the 90th day nor later than the 60th day before the
annual meeting, or the 10th day following the date on which Titan first publicly
announces the annual meeting date. The notice must include, as to each matter
the stockholder proposes to bring before the annual meeting:

    - a brief description of the business desired to be brought before the
      meeting and the reasons for conducting that business at the annual
      meeting;

    - the name, age and business and residential addresses, as they appear on
      Titan's records, of the stockholders proposing such business;

    - the class and number of Titan's capital stock which are beneficially owned
      by the stockholder; and

    - any material interest of the stockholder in the proposed business.

    DATRON.  The Datron bylaws require that a stockholder must give timely
notice in writing to the Secretary of Datron not less than 45 nor more than 75
days prior to the first anniversary of the date on which Datron first mailed its
proxy materials for the preceding year's annual meeting of stockholders;
provided, however, that if the date of the annual meeting is advanced more than
30 days prior to or delayed by more than 30 days after the anniversary of the
preceding year's annual meeting, notice by the stockholder must be delivered not
later than the close of business on the later of the 90th day prior to such
annual meeting or the 10th day following the day on which public announcement of
the date of such meeting is first made. Such stockholder's notice shall set
forth:

    - all information relating to each person whom the stockholder proposes to
      nominate for election or reelection as a director as would be required to
      be disclosed in solicitations of proxies for the election of such nominees
      as directors pursuant to Regulation 14A under the Securities

      Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and such person's written consent to
      serve as a director if elected;

    - as to any other business that the stockholder proposes to bring before the
      meeting, a brief description of such business, the reasons for conducting
      such business at the meeting, and any material interest in such business
      of such stockholder and the beneficial owner, if any, on whose behalf the
      proposal is made;

    - as to the stockholder giving the notice and the beneficial owner, if any,
      on whose behalf the nomination or proposal is made:

       (1) the name and address of such stockholder, as they appear on the
           corporation's books, and of such beneficial owner;

       (2) the class and number of shares of the corporation that are owned
           beneficially and of record by such stockholder and such beneficial
           owner; and

       (3) whether either such stockholder or beneficial owner intends to
           deliver a proxy statement and form of proxy to holders of, in the
           case of a proposal, at least the percentage of Datron's voting shares
           required under applicable law to carry the proposal or, in the case
           of a nomination or nominations, a sufficient number of holders of
           Datron's voting share
