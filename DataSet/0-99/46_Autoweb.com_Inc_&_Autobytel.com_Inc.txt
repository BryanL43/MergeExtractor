    Acquisition I Corp., a Delaware corporation and wholly-owned subsidiary of
    Registrant, with and into Autoweb.com, Inc., a Delaware corporation. The
    amount of Registrant's common stock to be registered has been determined by

    number of shares of Registrant that Registrant may be required to issue in
    connection with the proposed merger (calculated as 34,234,983 which is the
    sum of (a) 29,526,453 outstanding shares of Autoweb.com, Inc. common stock
    and (b) 4,708,530 shares of Autoweb.com, Inc. common stock issuable upon the
    exercise of outstanding options, whether or not exercised before
    consummation of the merger).

(2) Estimated solely for the purpose of calculating the registration fee
    pursuant to Rule 457(c) and (f) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended,
    based on the market value of Autoweb.com, Inc.'s common stock to be
    exchanged in the merger, as the product of (a) the average of the high and
    low sale prices of Autoweb.com, Inc.'s common stock on the Nasdaq National
    Market on May 4, 2001 and (b) the maximum number of shares of Registrant's
    common stock that may be exchanged in the merger, calculated as described in
    the foregoing footnote.

    THE REGISTRANT HEREBY AMENDS THIS REGISTRATION STATEMENT ON SUCH DATE OR
DATES AS MAY BE NECESSARY TO DELAY ITS EFFECTIVE DATE UNTIL THE REGISTRANT SHALL
FILE A FURTHER AMENDMENT WHICH SPECIFICALLY STATES THAT THIS REGISTRATION
STATEMENT SHALL THEREAFTER BECOME EFFECTIVE IN ACCORDANCE WITH SECTION 8(a) OF
THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933 OR UNTIL THE REGISTRATION STATEMENT SHALL BECOME
EFFECTIVE ON SUCH DATE AS THE COMMISSION, ACTING PURSUANT TO SAID SECTION 8(a),

                           FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS

     The statements contained in this joint proxy statement/prospectus that are
not historical facts are forward-looking statements under the federal securities
laws. These forward-looking statements, including statements about projected
revenues and expense savings and the projected number of subscribing dealers,
are not guarantees of future performance and involve certain risks,
uncertainties and assumptions that are difficult to predict. Actual outcomes and
results may differ materially from what is expressed in, or implied by, such
forward-looking statements. Autobytel and Autoweb undertake no obligation to
update publicly any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new
information, future events or otherwise. Among the important factors that could
cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in, or implied
by, the forward-looking statements are changes in general economic conditions,
increased or unexpected competition, the failure to realize anticipated
synergies, costs related to the proposed merger, failure to obtain required
stockholder or regulatory approvals or the merger not closing for any other
reason, failure of the combined company to retain and hire key employees,
difficulties in successfully integrating the parties' businesses and
technologies and other matters disclosed in Autobytel's and Autoweb's filings
with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Investors are strongly encouraged
to review both companies' annual reports on Form 10-K, as amended, for the year
ended December 31, 2000, and other reports on file with the Securities and
Exchange Commission for a discussion of risks and uncertainties that could
affect operating results and the market price of the companies' stock.

                QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS FOR AUTOBYTEL STOCKHOLDERS
                            AND AUTOWEB STOCKHOLDERS

Q: WHY ARE THE COMPANIES PROPOSING TO MERGE? (SEE PAGE   )

A: Autobytel and Autoweb are proposing to merge because we believe the
   combination provides strategic and financial benefits to both Autobytel and
   Autoweb stockholders. The combination will allow us to extend our market
   share while broadening our customer base. We believe the combination will
   help us to become the industry standard for automotive research information
   with the largest audience of online automotive shoppers.

Q: WHAT WILL BE THE EFFECT OF THE MERGER ON THE STOCKHOLDERS OF AUTOBYTEL AND
   AUTOWEB? (SEE PAGE   )

A: Upon consummation of the merger, Autoweb will become a wholly-owned
   subsidiary of Autobytel. After the merger, the current stockholders of
   Autobytel will own approximately 66% of Autobytel and the former stockholders
   of Autoweb will own approximately 34% of Autobytel.

Q: WHAT WILL AUTOWEB COMMON STOCKHOLDERS RECEIVE IN THE MERGER? (SEE PAGE   )

A: Upon filing of the certificate of merger with the Delaware Secretary of
   State:

   - holders of Autoweb common stock will receive 0.3553 shares of Autobytel
     common stock in exchange for each outstanding share of Autoweb common
     stock. No fractional shares will be issued. Autoweb common stockholders
     that otherwise would receive fractional shares will instead receive an
     amount of cash equal to the product of such fraction multiplied by the
     average closing price of Autobytel's common stock for the fifteen trading
     days immediately preceding the closing date of the merger, as reported on
     the Nasdaq National Market; and

   - Autobytel will assume options to purchase shares of Autoweb common stock in
     connection with the merger. The number of shares of Autobytel common stock
     purchasable under each post-merger option will be calculated using the
     merger exchange ratio of 0.3553 shares of Autobytel common stock for each
     share of Autoweb.

   Within thirty days after the filing of the certificate of merger with the
   Delaware Secretary of State, Autobytel will issue to each person, who
   immediately prior to that filing was a holder of an assumed option, a
   document evidencing the assumption of such option by Autobytel.

Q: DOES THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS OF AUTOBYTEL RECOMMEND VOTING IN FAVOR OF THE
   MERGER? (SEE PAGE   )

A: Yes. After careful consideration, Autobytel's board of directors unanimously
   recommends that its stockholders vote in favor of the issuance of Autobytel's
   common stock to the stockholders of Autoweb in connection with the merger.

Q: DOES THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS OF AUTOWEB RECOMMEND VOTING IN FAVOR OF THE
   MERGER? (SEE PAGE   )

A: Yes. After careful consideration, Autoweb's board of directors unanimously
   recommends that its stockholders vote in favor of the acquisition agreement
   and the proposed merger. Autoweb stockholders holding shares totaling
   approximately 30% of the outstanding common stock of Autoweb have agreed to
   vote in favor of the merger.

Q: ARE THERE RISKS I SHOULD CONSIDER IN DECIDING WHETHER TO VOTE FOR THE MERGER?
   (SEE PAGE   )

A: Yes. In evaluating the merger, you should carefully consider the factors
   discussed in the section entitled "Risk Factors" on page 8.

Q: WHAT DO I NEED TO DO NOW? (SEE PAGES   AND   )

A: Mail your signed proxy card in the enclosed return envelope as soon as
   possible so that your shares may be represented at your meeting.

   If you do not include instructions on how to vote your properly signed proxy
   card, your common stock will be voted "FOR" approval of matters related to
   the merger, "FOR" each of the proposals set forth

   in this joint proxy statement/prospectus to be considered at either company's
   annual meeting and, if any other matters are properly brought before either
   annual meeting, the persons named in the respective proxies will have
   discretion to vote on such matters.

Q: AS AN AUTOWEB STOCKHOLDER, SHOULD I SEND IN MY AUTOWEB STOCK CERTIFICATES
   WITH MY PROXY CARD? (SEE PAGE   )

A: No. After the merger is completed, Autobytel will send you written
   instructions for exchanging your Autoweb stock certificates for Autobytel
   stock certificates.

Q: IF MY SHARES ARE HELD IN "STREET NAME" BY MY BROKER, WILL MY BROKER VOTE MY
   SHARES FOR ME? (SEE PAGES   ,   )

A: Brokers cannot vote your shares with respect to the merger without
   instructions from you on how to vote. Therefore, it is important that you
   follow the directions provided by your broker regarding how to instruct your
   broker to vote your shares. If you are an Autoweb stockholder, and you fail
   to provide your broker with instructions, it will have the same effect as a
   vote against the acquisition agreement and the merger.

Q: WHAT DO I DO IF I WANT TO CHANGE MY VOTE? (SEE PAGES   ,   )

A: If you want to change your vote, send the secretary of Autobytel or Autoweb,
   as applicable, a later-dated, signed proxy card before your meeting or attend
   the meeting in person. You may also revoke your proxy card by sending written
   notice to the applicable secretary before the meeting.

Q: WHEN DO YOU EXPECT THE MERGER TO BE COMPLETED? (SEE PAGE   )

A: Autobytel and Autoweb are working toward completing the merger as quickly as
   possible. We hope to complete the merger late in the second calendar quarter
   or early in the third calendar quarter of 2001.

Q: WILL I BE TAXED ON THE MERGER? (SEE PAGE   )

A: Autobytel stockholders and Autoweb stockholders will not recognize gain or
   loss for United States federal income tax purposes as a result of the merger,
   except that Autoweb stockholders will recognize gain or loss resulting from
   the receipt of cash instead of any fractional shares of Autobytel common
   stock. All stockholders are urged to consult their own tax advisor to
   determine their particular tax consequences.

Q: ARE THE AUTOWEB STOCKHOLDERS ENTITLED TO DISSENTERS' OR APPRAISAL RIGHTS?
   (SEE PAGE   )

A: No, Autoweb stockholders do not have the opportunity to assert dissenters'
   rights.

Q: ARE THE AUTOBYTEL STOCKHOLDERS ENTITLED TO DISSENTERS' OR APPRAISAL RIGHTS?
   (SEE PAGE   )

A: No, Autobytel stockholders do not have the opportunity to assert dissenters'
   rights.

   questions about the merger.

   Autoweb stockholders should call Meri E. Glade, at (408) 970-9100, with any
   questions about the merger.

                SUMMARY OF THE JOINT PROXY STATEMENT/PROSPECTUS

     This joint proxy statement/prospectus pertains to the merger of a
wholly-owned subsidiary of Autobytel with and into Autoweb and other annual
meeting proposals for the annual meetings of Autoweb and Autobytel. This joint
proxy statement/prospectus is being sent to the holders of Autoweb common stock
and holders of Autobytel common stock.

     This summary may not contain all of the information that is important to
you. You should read carefully this entire document, including the acquisition
agreement and other documents attached to this joint proxy statement/prospectus
and the other documents referenced in it for a more complete understanding of
the merger. In particular, you should read the acquisition agreement, a
composite conformed copy of which is attached as Annex A, the opinion of Lehman
Brothers, which is attached as Annex B and the opinion of Credit Suisse First
Boston, which is attached as Annex C.

THE MERGER (SEE PAGE   )

     Autobytel and Autoweb are merging because they believe the resulting
combination will create a stronger, more competitive company capable of
achieving greater financial strength, operational efficiencies and growth
potential than either company would have on its own.

     In the merger, Autoweb will merge with a wholly-owned subsidiary of
Autobytel. Upon consummation of the merger, Autoweb will become a wholly-owned
subsidiary of Autobytel. Autoweb common stockholders will receive, in exchange
for each share of Autoweb common stock they hold, 0.3553 shares of Autobytel
common stock. No fraction of a share of Autobytel common stock will be issued,
but instead each holder of shares of Autoweb common stock who would otherwise be
entitled to a fraction of a share of Autobytel common stock shall receive an
amount of cash (rounded to the nearest whole cent) equal to the product of such
fraction multiplied by the average closing price of Autobytel common stock for
the fifteen trading days immediately preceding the closing date of the proposed
merger, as reported on the Nasdaq National Market. The number of shares of
Autobytel common stock awardable (after aggregating all fractional shares of
Autobytel common stock) shall be rounded down to the nearest whole share of
Autobytel common stock. After the merger, the current stockholders of Autobytel
will own approximately 66% of Autobytel and the former stockholders of Autoweb
will own approximately 34% of Autobytel.

     At the effective time of the merger, Autobytel will assume each outstanding
option issued under Autoweb's 1997 Stock Option Plan, 1999 Equity Incentive
Plan, 1999 Employee Stock Purchase Plan, and 1999 Directors Stock Option Plan,
whether vested or unvested, to purchase shares of Autoweb common stock on
substantially the same terms and conditions as were applicable prior to the
effective time of the merger, except that (1) the options will be exercisable
for shares of Autobytel common stock, and (2) the number of shares of Autobytel
common stock which may be purchased will be equal to the number of shares of
Autoweb common stock underlying the option multiplied by 0.3553. Any fractional
share of Autobytel common stock resulting from such adjustment will be rounded
down to the nearest whole number. The exercise price per share of Autobytel
common stock issuable under each Autoweb option will equal the per share
exercise price of the Autoweb common stock purchasable under the Autoweb option
divided by 0.3553. The exercise price will be rounded up to the nearest whole
cent.

     Within thirty days after the effective time, Autobytel will issue to each
person who immediately prior to the effective time was a holder of an assumed
option, an option document evidencing the foregoing assumption of such option by
Autobytel.

     Autobytel and Autoweb are working toward completing the merger as quickly
as possible. They hope to complete the merger late in the second calendar
quarter or early in the third calendar quarter of 2001.

     A composite conformed copy of the acquisition agreement is attached to this
joint proxy statement/ prospectus as Annex A. You are encouraged to read it
carefully. In evaluating the merger, you should also carefully consider the
factors discussed in the section entitled "Risk Factors" on page 8.

ANNUAL MEETING OF STOCKHOLDERS (SEE PAGES   )

     Autobytel will hold an annual meeting of its stockholders on          ,
2001. At the meeting, Autobytel stockholders will consider and vote on a
proposal to approve the issuance of Autobytel common stock to the stockholders
of Autoweb and will also vote to elect three directors, to ratify Autobytel's
independent public accountants for fiscal 2001 and to approve an amendment to
Autobytel's Certificate of Incorporation changing the name of Autobytel to

     Autobytel stockholders and Autoweb stockholders need to send in their
signed proxy card in the enclosed return envelope as soon as possible so that
their shares may be represented at the annual meetings discussed above. If
Autobytel stockholders and Autoweb stockholders do not include instructions on
how to vote their properly signed proxy card, their common stock will be voted
"FOR" approval of matters related to the merger, "FOR" each of the other
proposals discussed in this joint proxy

statement/prospectus and, if any other matters are properly brought before
either annual meeting, the persons named in the respective proxy cards will have
discretion to vote on such matters.

     Brokers cannot vote Autobytel stockholders' or Autoweb stockholders' shares
with respect to the merger without instructions from them on how to vote.
Therefore, it is important that Autobytel stockholders and Autoweb stockholders
follow the directions provided by their brokers regarding how to instruct their
broker to vote their shares. If Autoweb stockholders fail to provide their
brokers with instructions, it will have the same effect as a vote against the
acquisition agreement and the merger.

     If an Autobytel stockholder or an Autoweb stockholder wants to change their
vote, they should send the secretary of Autobytel or Autoweb, as applicable, a
later-dated, signed proxy card before the meeting or attend the meeting in
person. A proxy card may be revoked by sending written notice to the applicable
secretary before the meeting.

     After the merger is completed, Autoweb stockholders will receive written
instructions for exchanging their Autoweb stock certificates for Autobytel stock
certificates and Autoweb optionholders will receive new Autobytel option
agreements.

common stock in the merger.

RECOMMENDATION OF AUTOWEB'S BOARD OF DIRECTORS (SEE PAGE   )

     After careful consideration, Autoweb's board of directors unanimously
recommends that its stockholders vote for approval of the acquisition agreement
and the proposed merger, for election of its nominees for Class II director and
for the ratification of its independent public accountants for fiscal 2001.
Autoweb's board of directors has unanimously voted to approve the acquisition

approximately 30% of the outstanding common stock of Autoweb have agreed to vote

CONDITIONS TO COMPLETION OF THE MERGER (SEE PAGE   )

     The completion of the merger depends on meeting a number of conditions.

shares in favor of the acquisition agreement and the merger.

TERMINATION OF THE ACQUISITION AGREEMENT (SEE PAGE   )

     Autobytel and Autoweb each have the right to terminate the acquisition
agreement under certain circumstances. In certain cases, termination of the

the then current members of Autobytel's board of directors plus Jeffrey A.
Schwartz and Mark R. Ross.

     Following the merger, Mark Lorimer, the current President and Chief

OPINIONS OF AUTOBYTEL'S AND AUTOWEB'S FINANCIAL ADVISORS (SEE PAGES   AND   )

     In connection with the merger, Autobytel's board of directors considered
the opinion it received from its financial advisor, Lehman Brothers, as to the
fairness, from a financial point of view, to Autobytel, of the 0.3553 exchange
ratio provided for in the acquisition agreement. Autoweb's board of directors
considered the opinion it received from its financial advisor, Credit Suisse
First Boston, as to the fairness, from a financial point of view, as of March
31, 2001, to the holders of Autoweb common stock, of the 0.3553 exchange ratio
provided for in the acquisition agreement. The full text of the written opinions
of the financial advisors are attached to this document as Annex B and Annex C,
and should be read carefully in their entirety to understand the procedures
followed, the assumptions made, matters considered and limitations on the review
undertaken in providing the opinions. The opinion of Lehman Brothers is directed
to the Autobytel board of directors and the opinion of Credit Suisse First
Boston is directed to the Autoweb board of directors, and these opinions do not
address the prices at which Autobytel's common stock will trade after the
proposed merger and do not constitute a recommendation to any stockholder as to
how to vote with respect to any matter relating to the proposed merger.

UNITED STATES FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSEQUENCES OF THE MERGER (SEE PAGE   )

     We have structured the merger so that, in general, Autobytel, Autobytel's
stockholders, Autoweb and Autoweb's stockholders will not recognize gain or loss
for United States federal income tax purposes as a result of the merger, except
that Autoweb stockholders will recognize a gain or loss resulting from the
receipt of cash instead of fractional shares of Autobytel common stock.

     It is a condition to the merger that both Autobytel and Autoweb receive
legal opinions to the effect that the merger will constitute a "reorganization"
within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code.

     All stockholders are urged to consult their own tax advisors to determine
their particular tax consequences.

ACCOUNTING TREATMENT OF THE MERGER (SEE PAGE   )

     Autobytel intends to account for the merger as a "purchase" for financial
accounting purposes, in accordance with United States generally accepted
accounting principles.

INTERESTS OF CERTAIN PERSONS IN THE MERGER (SEE PAGE   )

     When considering the recommendations of Autoweb's board of directors, you
should be aware that certain Autoweb directors, officers and stockholders have
interests in the merger that are different from, or are in addition to, yours.
These interests include the assumption of options, accelerated vesting of
options, the employment of certain Autoweb executive officers by Autobytel after
the merger, possible severance payments and the indemnification of directors and
officers of Autoweb against certain liabilities both before and after the
merger.

DISSENTERS' RIGHTS (SEE PAGE   )

     Under Delaware law, Autobytel stockholders and Autoweb stockholders are not
entitled to dissenters' rights in connection with the merger.

RESTRICTIONS ON THE ABILITY TO SELL AUTOBYTEL STOCK (SEE PAGE   )

     All Autobytel common stock received by Autoweb stockholders in connection
with the merger will be freely transferable unless the holder is considered an
affiliate of either Autoweb or Autobytel under the Securities Act of 1933, as
amended. Shares of Autobytel held by affiliates may only be sold pursuant to a
registration statement or an exemption from the registration requirements of the
Securities Act.

                                  RISK FACTORS

     The merger involves a high degree of risk. By voting in favor of the
merger, current Autoweb stockholders will be choosing to invest in Autobytel
common stock, and current Autobytel stockholders will face dilution of their
ownership interest in Autobytel. An investment in Autobytel common stock
involves a high degree of risk. In addition to the other information contained
in this joint proxy statement/prospectus, you should carefully consider all of
the following risk factors relating to the proposed merger, the combined
company, Autobytel and Autoweb, in deciding whether to vote for the merger and
the related issuance of Autobytel shares.

GENERAL RISKS RELATED TO THE MERGER AND THE COMBINED COMPANIES

THE NUMBER OF AUTOBYTEL SHARES TO BE RECEIVED BY AUTOWEB STOCKHOLDERS IN THE
MERGER IS FIXED AND WILL NOT BE ADJUSTED FOR CHANGES IN THE PRICE OF AUTOBYTEL
OR AUTOWEB SHARES.

     At the closing of the merger, each share of Autoweb common stock will be
exchanged for 0.3553 shares of Autobytel common stock. This exchange ratio will
not be adjusted for changes in the market price of Autobytel common stock or
Autoweb common stock. Any reduction in Autobytel's common stock price will
result in Autoweb stockholders receiving less value in the merger at closing.
Autoweb stockholders may not know the exact value of Autobytel's common stock to
be issued to them in the merger at the time of the annual meeting of Autoweb
stockholders.

     The market price of Autobytel's common stock, like that of the shares of
many other technology and Internet companies, has been and is expected to
continue to be volatile and the value of Autobytel common stock issued in the
merger will depend on its market price at the time of the merger. For example,
since Autobytel's initial public offering on March 26, 1999, Autobytel common
stock has traded as high as $58 per share and as low as $[     ] per share.
During the past twelve months Autobytel's common stock has ranged from [     ]
to [     ]. Stockholders of Autobytel and Autoweb are urged to obtain current
market quotations for Autobytel and Autoweb common stock.

AUTOBYTEL WILL FACE SIGNIFICANT CHALLENGES IN INTEGRATING AUTOBYTEL AND AUTOWEB
AND, AS A RESULT, MAY NOT REALIZE THE EXPECTED BENEFITS OF THE MERGER.

     The merger involves the integration of two companies that have previously
operated independently. Combining the operations of Autobytel and Autoweb will
be a complex process that will require, among other things, integration of
various functional areas, such as finance, human resources and sales and
marketing groups, and coordination of development efforts. Autobytel cannot be
certain that the integration will be completed in a timely manner or that it
will achieve the anticipated benefits of the merger. Failure to adequately
manage the integration process and to coordinate the joint efforts of the two
companies after the merger may have a material adverse effect on the business of
the combined company.

INTEGRATION OF THE BUSINESSES OF AUTOBYTEL AND AUTOWEB OR ELIMINATION OF CERTAIN
FUNCTIONAL AREAS MAY NEGATIVELY AFFECT AUTOBYTEL'S OR AUTOWEB'S RELATIONSHIPS
WITH CONSUMERS, DEALERS OR INTERNET PORTALS.

     There may be significant overlap in certain of the companies' assets,
functional areas or businesses and Autobytel will be required to determine
whether to maintain or eliminate such duplication. For example, the companies
maintain independent relationships with automobile dealers and Internet portals.
The combination of the two companies and the resulting overlap of services may
result in disruption of relationships with dealers or Internet portals, any of
which may result in a reduction in the number or rate of growth of the number of
consumers for one or both of the companies or a reduction in the number or
quality of relationships with dealers or Internet portals. Any disruption in
relationships with dealers or Internet portals could negatively impact the
experiences of consumers using Autobytel's or Autoweb's services and could
reduce the number of consumers directed to the companies' Web sites, any of
which may have a material adverse effect on the combined companies' business and
revenues. Autoweb also engages in lines of business not conducted by Autobytel,
including Automotive Information Center, or AIC, a provider of data and
information technology tools and original automotive editorial content to

vehicle manufacturers, dealer groups and Web destinations. Any failure by
Autobytel to integrate or manage these business lines may result in a disruption
of Autobytel's business or operations.

AUTOBYTEL WILL INCUR SIGNIFICANT COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE MERGER WHICH COULD
NEGATIVELY AFFECT AUTOBYTEL'S FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE.

     Autobytel expects to incur significant costs and commit significant
management time integrating Autoweb's operations, technology, development
programs, products, clients and personnel. These costs may be substantial and
may include costs for:

     - integration of operations, including combining teams and processes in
       various functional areas;

     - fees and expenses of professionals and consultants involved in completing
       the integration process;

     - reorganization or closure of facilities;

     - incurring potential existing liabilities of Autoweb;

     - employee severance costs; and

     - integration of technology and products.

IF THE BENEFITS OF THE MERGER ARE NOT REALIZED OR IF THEY DO NOT MEET THE
EXPECTATIONS OF INVESTORS OR FINANCIAL OR INDUSTRY ANALYSTS, THE MARKET PRICE OF
AUTOBYTEL COMMON STOCK MAY DECLINE.

     The market price of Autobytel common stock may decline as a following the
merger if:

     - the integration of Autobytel and Autoweb is not completed in a timely and
       efficient manner;

     - Autobytel does not achieve the benefits of the merger as rapidly as, or
       to the extent, anticipated by financial or industry analysts;

     - Autobytel or Autoweb incurs liabilities that are not anticipated or are
       greater than expected by securities analysts or investors;

     - the effect of the merger on Autobytel's financial results is not
       consistent with the expectations of financial or industry analysts;

     - the combined companies are unable to obtain additional capital on
       acceptable terms when required; or

     - significant stockholders of Autobytel following the merger determine to
       dispose of their shares because the results of the merger are not
       consistent with their expectations.

AUTOWEB'S OFFICERS AND DIRECTORS HAVE CONFLICTS OF INTEREST THAT MAY INFLUENCE
THEM TO SUPPORT OR APPROVE THE MERGER.

     The directors and officers of Autoweb participate in arrangements and have
continuing indemnification against liabilities that provide them with interests
in the merger that are different from, or in addition to, those of other Autoweb
stockholders, including the following:

          As of March 31, 2001, the executive officers and directors of Autoweb
     owned options to purchase an aggregate of approximately 2.8 million shares
     of Autoweb common stock, of which approximately 1.6 million are unvested or
     subject to a right of Autoweb to repurchase the shares. If the merger were
     completed, as of the above date, approximately 1.2 million of the unvested
     options will accelerate and become immediately exercisable under their
     existing terms. If the merger were completed and all officers are
     terminated other than for cause in the 12 months following such date, then
     approximately

     an additional 406,000 of the unvested options would accelerate and become
     immediately exercisable under their existing terms;

        - certain officers of Autoweb are entitled to benefits, including
          substantial severance packages, if their employment is terminated
          after a change of control of Autoweb, such as the merger;

        - Autobytel has entered into an employment agreement with Jeffrey
          Schwartz, an executive officer of Autoweb, that takes effect upon
          consummation of the merger and may enter into agreements with other
          executive officers; and

        - Autobytel has agreed to cause the surviving corporation in the merger
          to indemnify each present and former Autoweb officer and director
          against liabilities arising out of such person's services as an
          officer or director. Autobytel will use commercially reasonable
          efforts to cause the surviving corporation to maintain officers' and
          directors' liability insurance to cover any such liabilities for the
          next six years.

     The directors and officers of Autoweb may therefore have been more likely
to vote to approve the acquisition agreement and the merger than if they did not
have these interests. Autoweb stockholders should consider whether these
interests may have influenced these directors and officers to support or
recommend the merger. You should read more about these interests under
"Interests of Autoweb Directors, Officers, Employees and Significant
Stockholders in the Merger" on page   , "Employment Contracts and Termination of
Employment and Change-in-Control Arrangements" on page   and under "Employment
Agreements" on page   .

RISKS RELATED TO THE COMBINED BUSINESSES AFTER THE MERGER

BOTH AUTOBYTEL AND AUTOWEB HAVE A HISTORY OF NET LOSSES AND AUTOBYTEL CANNOT
ASSURE YOU THAT IT WILL BE PROFITABLE AFTER THE MERGER IS COMPLETED. IF
AUTOBYTEL CONTINUES TO LOSE MONEY, ITS OPERATIONS WILL NOT BE FINANCIALLY
VIABLE.

     Because of the relatively recent emergence of the Internet-based vehicle
information and purchasing industry, none of Autobytel's senior executives has
long-term experience in the industry. This limited operating history means it is
difficult for Autobytel to predict future operating results.

     Autobytel has incurred losses every quarter since inception and expects to
continue to incur losses until the second half of 2001. Even if Autobytel were
to achieve profitability in the second half of 2001, it might fail to sustain or
increase that profitability on a quarterly or annual basis. Autobytel cannot
assure that it will be profitable during such period or thereafter. Autobytel,
including A.I.N. Corporation, either referred to herein as A.I.N. or CarSmart,
had an accumulated deficit of $99.7 million as of March 31, 2001 and $95.6
million as of December 31, 2000. Autoweb has incurred net losses in each fiscal
year since its inception, including a net loss of $38.4 million in 2000. Autoweb
had an accumulated deficit of $93.3 million as of March 31, 2001. Thus, the
combined companies' accumulated net losses/deficit would be more than $180
million after the merger. We cannot assure you that the merger of Autobytel and
Autoweb, each of which has experienced losses in recent years, will result in a
profitable combined company.

     Autobytel's potential for future profitability after the merger must be
considered in light of the risks, uncertainties, expenses and difficulties
frequently encountered by companies in the early stages of development,
particularly companies in new and rapidly evolving markets, such as the market
for Internet commerce. To achieve profitability, Autobytel must, among other
things:

     - generate increased vehicle buyer traffic to its Web sites including
       Autoweb's sites;

     - successfully introduce new products and services;

     - continue to send new and pre-owned vehicle purchase requests to dealers
       that result in sufficient dealer transactions to justify its fees;

     - continue to expand the number of dealers in Autobytel's network, in
       addition to retaining the Autoweb dealers, and enhance the quality of
       dealers;

     - respond to competitive developments;

     - maintain a high degree of customer satisfaction;

     - provide secure and easy to use Web sites for customers;

     - increase its brand name visibility;

     - continue to attract, retain and motivate qualified personnel; and

     - continue to upgrade and enhance its technologies to accommodate expanded
       service offerings and increased consumer traffic.

Autobytel cannot assure that the combined companies will be successful in
achieving these goals.

INTERNET COMMERCE IS NEW AND EVOLVING WITH FEW PROFITABLE BUSINESS MODELS.
AUTOBYTEL CANNOT ASSURE THAT THE BUSINESS MODEL, INCLUDING THE AUTOWEB BUSINESS,
WILL BE PROFITABLE.

     The market for Internet-based purchasing services has only recently begun
to develop and is rapidly evolving. While many Internet commerce companies have
grown in terms of revenues, few are profitable. Autobytel cannot assure that it
will be profitable. As is typical for a new and rapidly evolving industry,
demand and market acceptance for recently introduced services and products over
the Internet are subject to a high level of uncertainty and there are few proven
services and products. Moreover, since the market for such services is still
evolving, it is difficult to predict the future growth rate, if any, and size of
this market. The extent to which other participants in the automotive industry
will accept the role of third-party, all-make, all-model services such as
Autobytel and Autoweb is not yet known.

AUTOBYTEL'S AND AUTOWEB'S QUARTERLY FINANCIAL RESULTS ARE SUBJECT TO SIGNIFICANT
FLUCTUATIONS WHICH MAY MAKE IT DIFFICULT FOR INVESTORS TO PREDICT AUTOBYTEL'S
FUTURE PERFORMANCE.

     Each of Autobytel's and Autoweb's quarterly operating results have
fluctuated in the past, and the combined companies' results may fluctuate in the
future due to many factors. Autobytel's expense levels are based in part on its
expectations of future revenues which may vary significantly. If revenues do not
increase faster than expenses, Autobytel's business, results of operations and
financial condition will be materially and adversely affected even after giving
effect to the merger. Other factors that may adversely affect Autobytel's
quarterly operating results include:

     - Autobytel's ability to retain existing dealers, including those added by
       the merger, attract new dealers and maintain dealer and customer
       satisfaction;

     - the announcement or introduction of new or enhanced sites, services and
       products by Autobytel or Autobytel's competitors;

     - Autobytel's ability to joint venture with investors in the development of
       Autobytel-branded companies internationally;

     - general economic conditions and economic conditions specific to the
       Internet, online commerce or the automobile industry;

     - a decline in the usage levels of online services and consumer acceptance
       of the Internet and commercial online services for the purchase of
       consumer products and services such as those offered by Autobytel;

     - Autobytel's ability to upgrade and develop its systems and infrastructure
       and to attract new personnel in a timely and effective manner;

     - the level of traffic on Autobytel's Web sites, including the Autoweb
       sites, and other sites that refer traffic to Autobytel's Web sites;

     - technical difficulties, system downtime or Internet brownouts;

     - the amount and timing of operating costs and capital expenditures
       relating to expansion of Autobytel's business, operations and
       infrastructure;

     - governmental regulation; and

     - unforeseen events affecting the industry.

SEASONALITY IS LIKELY TO CAUSE FLUCTUATIONS IN AUTOBYTEL'S OPERATING RESULTS
AFTER THE MERGER. INVESTORS MAY NOT BE ABLE TO PREDICT AUTOBYTEL'S ANNUAL
OPERATING RESULTS BASED ON A QUARTER TO QUARTER COMPARISON OF AUTOBYTEL'S
OPERATING RESULTS.

     Autobytel expects the combined business to experience seasonality as it
matures. The seasonal patterns of Internet usage and vehicle purchasing do not
completely overlap. Historically, Internet usage typically declines during
summer and certain holiday periods, while vehicle purchasing in the United
States is strongest in the spring and summer months. If seasonality occurs,
investors may not be able to predict Autobytel's annual operating results based
on a quarter to quarter comparison of Autobytel's operating results, not only
because of seasonability but because the merger will make comparison to
historical results more difficult. Seasonality in the automotive industry,
Internet and commercial online service usage and advertising expenditures is
likely to cause fluctuations in the combined companies' operating results and
could have a material adverse effect on their business, operating results and
financial condition.

AUTOBYTEL IS A NEW BUSINESS IN A NEW INDUSTRY WHICH, AS EVIDENCED BY THE MERGER,
IS CHANGING AND NEEDS TO MANAGE ITS GROWTH AND ITS ENTRY INTO NEW BUSINESS AREAS
TO AVOID INCREASED EXPENSES WITHOUT CORRESPONDING REVENUES.

     Autobytel has been constantly expanding its operations and introducing new
services to consumers and dealers to establish itself as a leader in the
evolving market for Internet-based vehicle purchasing and related services.
Autobytel also intends to enter into new markets overseas. The growth of
Autobytel's operations, including the growth resulting from the merger, may
require Autobytel to increase expenditures. For example, Autobytel will, after
the merger, continue to need to hire personnel to oversee the introduction of
new services before it generates revenues from these services. Autobytel's
inability to generate satisfactory revenues from such expanded services to
offset costs could have a material adverse effect on Autobytel's business,
financial condition and results of operations.

     Autobytel must also:

     - test, introduce and develop new services and products, including
       enhancing its Web sites, including Autoweb's sites,

     - expand the breadth of products and services offered,

     - expand Autobytel's market presence through relationships with third
       parties,

     - successfully and timely integrate Autoweb's technology and business, and

     - acquire new or complementary businesses, products or technologies.

     Even with the increased services and relationships resulting from the
merger, Autobytel cannot assure that it can successfully manage these tasks.

IF AUTOBYTEL'S DEALER TURNOVER INCREASES, AUTOBYTEL'S DEALER NETWORKS AND
REVENUES DERIVED FROM THESE NETWORKS MAY DECREASE.

     The majority of Autobytel's revenues are derived from fees paid by
Autobytel's networks of subscribing dealers. Autoweb primarily charges its
member dealers for each qualified purchase inquiry delivered. After the merger
both models will be available to dealers from the combined companies, but

both models are subject to dealer turnover. If dealer turnover increases and the
combined companies are unable to add new dealers to mitigate the turnover,
revenues may decrease. In addition, if Autobytel fails to retain and increase
existing levels of consumer usage on Autoweb Web sites, or cannot retain and
increase the number of Autoweb's commercial relationships, dealer revenues could
decrease and the combined companies' business, results of operations and
financial condition will be materially and adversely affected. A material factor
affecting dealer turnover is the ability to provide dealers with high quality
purchase requests. High quality purchase requests are those that result in high
closing ratios. Closing ratio is the ratio of the number of vehicles purchased
at a dealer generated from purchase requests to the total number of purchase
requests sent to that dealer. All of Autobytel's current subscribing dealers
have entered into written marketing agreements with Autobytel having a stated
term of one year, three years or five years, but the Autobytel dealer agreements
are cancelable by the dealer upon 30 days notice. A significant number of the
agreements are for a one year term. Some of Autoweb's current dealers have
entered into three year service agreements that are also terminable on 30-day's
notice. Autobytel cannot assure that dealers will not terminate their agreements
with Autobytel or Autoweb. Subscribing dealers may terminate their relationship
with Autobytel or Autoweb for any reason, including an unwillingness to accept
subscription terms or as a result of joining alternative marketing programs.
Autobytel's and Autoweb's businesses are dependent upon their ability to attract
and retain qualified new and pre-owned vehicle dealers. During the first quarter
of 2001, Autobytel added approximately 300 subscribing dealers to Autobytel's
North American dealer networks, and approximately 700 subscribing dealers
terminated their affiliation with Autobytel or were terminated by Autobytel.
During the first quarter of 2001, Autoweb added approximately 115 member
dealers, and approximately 780 member dealers terminated their affiliation with
Autoweb or were terminated by Autoweb. To grow or maintain Autobytel's and
Autoweb's dealer networks, they need to reduce dealer turnover. Autobytel cannot
assure that the combined companies will be able to reduce the level of dealer
turnover, and failure to do so could materially and adversely affect their
business, results of operations and financial condition.

     As of March 31, 2001, Autobytel and Autoweb had approximately 4,700 dealers
and 4,400 dealers, respectively. Autoweb's member dealer fees represented
approximately 60%, 66% and 78% of its revenues in 2000, 1999 and 1998,
respectively. For the quarter ended March 31, 2001, member dealer fees
represented approximately 60% of revenues. Autobytel's program fees represented
approximately 81%, 89% and 96% of its revenue in 2000, 1999 and 1998,
respectively. For the first quarter ended March 31, 2001, program fees
represented approximately 77% of Autobytel's revenues. Recognizing differences
in the way dealer revenues are generated and taking into account overlap of the
same dealers, Autobytel anticipates that after the merger the combined companies
will have approximately 7,000 dealers. However, due to the overlap of provided
services, termination of services or changes in services due to integration of
the two companies, some of these dealers may terminate their relationships with
Autobytel or Autoweb.

AUTOBYTEL AND AUTOWEB RELY HEAVILY ON THEIR PARTICIPATING DEALERS TO PROMOTE
THEIR BRAND VALUE BY PROVIDING HIGH QUALITY SERVICES TO THEIR CONSUMERS. IF
DEALERS DO NOT PROVIDE AUTOBYTEL'S CONSUMERS, INCLUDING AUTOWEB CONSUMERS, HIGH
QUALITY SERVICES, ITS BRAND VALUE WILL DIMINISH AND THE NUMBER OF CONSUMERS WHO
USE AUTOBYTEL'S SERVICES MAY DECLINE, CAUSING A DECREASE IN THE COMBINED
COMPANIES' REVENUES.

     Promotion of Autobytel's brand value, including the Autoweb brand, depends
on the ability to provide consumers a high quality experience for purchasing
vehicles throughout the purchasing process. If Autobytel's dealers do not
provide consumers with high quality service, the value of Autobytel's brands
could be damaged and the number of consumers using Autobytel's services,
including those who use the Autoweb sites, may decrease. Autobytel now devotes
significant efforts, and the combined company will need to devote its efforts,
to train participating dealers in practices that are intended to increase
consumer satisfaction. Autobytel's inability to train dealers effectively, or
the failure by participating dealers to adopt recommended practices, respond
rapidly and professionally to vehicle inquiries, or sell and lease vehicles in
accordance with Autobytel's marketing strategies could result in low consumer
satisfaction, damage one or more Autobytel brands and could materially and
adversely affect the combined companies' business, results of operations and
financial condition after the merger.

AUTOBYTEL MAY LOSE SUBSCRIBING DEALERS IF AUTOBYTEL RECONFIGURES DEALER
TERRITORIES. IF AUTOBYTEL LOSES DEALERS, THE COMBINED COMPANIES WILL LOSE THE
REVENUES ASSOCIATED WITH THOSE DEALERS.

     If the volume of purchase requests increases, Autobytel may need to reduce
or reconfigure the exclusive territories currently assigned to dealers to serve
consumers more effectively. If a dealer is unwilling to accept a reduction or
reconfiguration of its territory, it may terminate its relationship with
Autobytel. A dealer also could sue Autobytel to prevent such reduction or
reconfiguration, or collect damages from Autobytel. Autobytel has experienced
one such lawsuit. A material decrease in the number of dealers subscribing to
Autobytel's network or litigation with dealers could have a material adverse
effect on the combined companies' business, results of operations and financial
condition.

IF ANY OF AUTOBYTEL'S OR AUTOWEB'S RELATIONSHIPS WITH INTERNET SEARCH ENGINES OR
ONLINE AUTOMOTIVE INFORMATION PROVIDERS TERMINATES, THEIR COMBINED PURCHASE
REQUEST VOLUME COULD DECLINE. IF PURCHASE REQUEST VOLUME OR THE QUALITY OF LEADS
DECLINES, PARTICIPATING DEALERS MAY TERMINATE THEIR RELATIONSHIP WITH AUTOBYTEL
OR FORCE AUTOBYTEL TO DECREASE THE FEES CHARGED FOR ITS SERVICES. IF THIS
OCCURS, THE COMBINED COMPANIES' REVENUES WOULD DECREASE.

     Autobytel and Autoweb depend on a number of strategic relationships to
direct a substantial amount of purchase requests and traffic to their Web sites.
After the merger is completed, the termination of any of these relationships or
any significant reduction in traffic to Web sites on which Autobytel's services,
including Autoweb services, are advertised or offered, or the failure to develop
additional referral sources, would cause purchase request volume, or the quality
of requests, to decline. If this occurs, dealers might no longer be satisfied
with Autobytel's service and might terminate their relationships with Autobytel
or force Autobytel to decrease the fees Autobytel charges for services. If
Autobytel's dealers terminate their relationships with Autobytel or force
Autobytel to reduce the fees it charges for its services, Autobytel's revenues
will decline which could have a material adverse effect on the combined
companies' business, results of operations and financial condition.

     Autobytel and Autoweb receive a significant number of purchase requests
through a limited number of Internet search engines, online automotive
information providers, and other auto related Internet sites. Autobytel and
Autoweb periodically negotiate revisions to existing agreements and such
revisions could increase costs in future periods. During the first quarter of
2001, approximately 33% of Autobytel's purchase requests came through
StoneAge.com. The agreement with StoneAge Corporation expires in March 2002 and
unless terminated by either party, automatically renews for a term of up to
twelve (12) months. During the year 2000, approximately 23% of Autoweb's new
car, and 10% of Autoweb's pre-owned car, purchase requests came through
relationships with AOL and Lycos which were recently renegotiated to lower
costs. The impact of the restructured agreements on costs and the volume of
requests is not yet known. Autobytel may not be able to maintain its
relationship with its or Autoweb's online service providers or find alternative,
comparable marketing sponsorships and alliances capable of originating
significant numbers of purchase requests on terms satisfactory to Autobytel. A
number of Autobytel's and Autoweb's agreements with online service providers may
be terminated without cause.

IF ANY OF AUTOBYTEL'S OR AUTOWEB'S RELATIONSHIPS WITH OTHER STRATEGIC PARTIES
TERMINATES, THE COMBINED COMPANIES' BUSINESS, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND
FINANCIAL CONDITION COULD SUFFER.

     Autobytel and Autoweb have established, and Autobytel intends to continue
to establish, key strategic relationships in the automotive, financial services,
insurance, data aggregation and information services industries and in
Internet-related industries. Autobytel intends to develop and offer a variety of
services for Autobytel's customers, including Autoweb's customers, including
financing, leasing, warranties and insurance options and provision of automotive
industry-related information. In particular, Autobytel's and Autoweb's
relationships with lenders and financial institutions, insurance companies,
automotive industry data aggregators, extended warranty providers and other
Internet Web site businesses, including Internet search engines, are crucial to
the continued development and future success of the combined business. In the
event that Autobytel's strategic partners were no longer interested in
maintaining or establishing relationships with Autobytel on commercially viable
terms, Autobytel's ability to provide a full range of

cost-effective services to its customers would be adversely affected and the
combined companies' business, results of operations and financial condition
could suffer.

     Autobytel and Autoweb currently license from third parties certain
technologies and information incorporated into their Web sites. As Autobytel
continues to introduce new services that incorporate new technologies and
information, Autobytel may be required to license additional technology and
information from others. Autobytel cannot assure that these third-party
technology and information licenses will continue to be available to Autobytel
on commercially reasonable terms, if at all, after the merger. Additionally,
Autobytel cannot assure that the third parties from which Autobytel and Autoweb
currently license their technology and information will be able to defend their
proprietary rights successfully against claims of infringement. Any failure to
obtain any of these technology and information licenses could result in delays
or reductions in the introduction of new features, functions or services. It
could also adversely affect the performance of the combined companies' existing
services until equivalent technology or information can be identified, obtained
and integrated.

     Autobytel and Autoweb have entered into agreements with various partners,
some of which require Autobytel or Autoweb to feature them exclusively in
certain sections of their Web sites. After the merger, existing and future
exclusive arrangements may prevent Autobytel from entering into other content
agreements, advertising or sponsorship arrangements or other commercial
relationships. Many companies that Autobytel may pursue for a commercial
relationship may also offer competing services. As a result, these competitors
may be reluctant to enter into commercial relationships with Autobytel.
Autobytel's business could be adversely affected if Autobytel does not maintain
the existing commercial relationships, including those set up by Autoweb, on
terms as favorable as currently in effect, if Autobytel does not establish
additional commercial relationships on commercially reasonable terms or if
Autobytel's commercial relationships do not result in the expected increased use
of Autobytel's Web sites. Failure of one or more of Autobytel's or Autoweb's
relationships to achieve or maintain market acceptance or commercial success or
the termination of one or more relationships could have a material adverse
effect on the combined companies' business, results of operations and financial
condition.

INTENSE COMPETITION COULD REDUCE AUTOBYTEL'S MARKET SHARE, EVEN AFTER GIVING
EFFECT TO THE MERGER, AND HARM ITS FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE. AUTOBYTEL'S MARKET IS
COMPETITIVE NOT ONLY BECAUSE THE INTERNET HAS MINIMAL TECHNICAL BARRIERS TO
ENTRY, BUT ALSO BECAUSE AUTOBYTEL AND AUTOWEB COMPETE DIRECTLY WITH OTHER
COMPANIES IN THE OFFLINE ENVIRONMENT.

     Autobytel's and Autoweb's vehicle purchasing services compete against a
variety of Internet and traditional vehicle purchasing services, automotive
brokers and classified advertisement providers. Therefore, they are affected by
the competitive factors faced by both Internet commerce companies as well as
traditional, offline companies within the automotive and automotive-related
industries. The market for Internet-based commercial services is new, and
competition among commercial Web sites may increase significantly in the future.
Autobytel's and Autoweb's business is characterized by minimal technical
barriers to entry, and new competitors can launch a competitive service at
relatively low cost. To compete successfully, Autobytel must significantly
increase awareness of its services and brand names. Failure to compete
successfully will cause the combined companies' revenues to decline and would
have a material adverse effect on their business, results of operations and
financial condition.

     Autobytel and Autoweb compete with other entities which maintain similar
commercial Web sites including AutoVantage, Microsoft Corporation's CarPoint,
CarsDirect.com, Cars.com, Cobalt Group and AutoTrader.com. AutoNation, a large
consolidator of dealers, has a Web site for marketing vehicles. Autobytel also
competes, and the combined companies after the merger will compete, indirectly
against vehicle brokerage firms and affinity programs offered by several
companies, including Costco Wholesale Corporation and Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. In
addition, all major vehicle manufacturers have their own Web sites and many have
launched online buying services, such as General Motors Corporation's BuyPower
and Ford Motor Company's FordDirect.com. Autobytel and Autoweb also compete with
vehicle insurers, lenders and lessors as well as other dealers that are not part
of Autobytel's network. Such companies may

already maintain or may introduce Web sites which compete with Autobytel's Web
sites, including the Autoweb sites.

     Autobytel believes that the principal competitive factors in the online
market are:

     - brand recognition;

     - speed and quality of fulfillment;

     - variety of related products and services;

     - ease of use;

     - customer satisfaction;

     - quality of Web site content;

     - quality of service; and

     - technical expertise.

     Autobytel cannot assure that it can compete successfully against current or
future competitors, many of which have substantially more capital, existing
brand recognition, resources and access to additional financing. In addition,
competitive pressures may result in increased marketing costs, decreased Web
site traffic or loss of market share or otherwise may materially and adversely
affect the combined companies' business, results of operations and financial
condition.

IF AUTOBYTEL CANNOT BUILD AND MAINTAIN STRONG BRAND LOYALTY, ITS BUSINESS WILL
SUFFER.

     Autobytel believes that the importance of brand recognition will increase
as more companies engage in commerce over the Internet. Development and
awareness of the Autobytel.com, CarSmart.com, Autoweb.com and Autosite.com
brands will depend largely on Autobytel's ability to obtain a leadership
position in Internet commerce. If dealers do not perceive the combined companies
as an effective channel for increasing vehicle sales, or consumers do not
perceive Autobytel, including Autoweb, as offering reliable information
concerning new and pre-owned vehicles, as well as referrals to high quality
dealers, in a user-friendly manner that reduces the time spent for vehicle
purchases, the combined companies will be unsuccessful in promoting and
maintaining their brands. Failure to gain widespread brand acceptance among
consumers or dealers would have a material adverse effect on the combined
companies' business, results of operations and financial condition.

IF AUTOBYTEL LOSES KEY PERSONNEL OR IS UNABLE TO ATTRACT, TRAIN AND RETAIN
ADDITIONAL HIGHLY QUALIFIED SALES, MARKETING, MANAGERIAL AND TECHNICAL
PERSONNEL, THE COMBINED COMPANIES' BUSINESS MAY SUFFER.

     Autobytel's future success depends on Autobytel's ability to identify,
hire, train and retain highly qualified sales, marketing, managerial and
technical personnel. In addition, as the combined companies introduce new
services, they may need to hire additional personnel. Current and prospective
Autoweb employees may experience uncertainty about their future roles with
Autobytel and may, as a result, seek other employment. Autobytel may be unable
to retain Autobytel and Autoweb management and technical, sales and customer
support personnel that are critical to the successful integration of Autobytel
and Autoweb, resulting in disruption of operations, loss of key information,
expertise or know-how and unanticipated additional recruitment and training
costs and otherwise diminishing anticipated benefits of the merger. Competition
for such personnel is intense, and Autobytel may not be able to attract,
assimilate or retain such personnel in the future. The inability to attract and
retain the necessary managerial, technical, sales and marketing personnel could
have a material adverse effect on the combined companies' business, results of
operations and financial condition.

     Autobytel's business and operations are substantially dependent on the
performance of Autobytel's executive officers and key employees, some of whom
are employed on an at-will basis and all of whom have worked together for only a
short period of time. Autobytel maintains "key person" life insurance in

the amount of $3.0 million on the life of Mark W. Lorimer, Autobytel's Chief
Executive Officer and President. The loss of the services of Mr. Lorimer or one
or more of Autobytel's other executive officers or key employees could have a
material adverse effect on the combined companies' business, results of
operations and financial condition.

AUTOBYTEL'S INTERNATIONAL EXPANSION MAY REQUIRE COMPLIANCE WITH BURDENSOME
REGULATORY, TARIFF AND LICENSING REQUIREMENTS. AUTOBYTEL'S NEED TO COMPLY WITH
GOVERNMENTAL REQUIREMENTS MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT ITS ABILITY TO EXPAND ITS
BUSINESS.

     Autobytel's licensees have launched Web sites in the United Kingdom,
Sweden, The Netherlands, Spain, Australia and Japan. Autobytel intends to expand
Autobytel's brand into other foreign markets through licensing its technology,
business processes and trade names and by establishing relationships with
vehicle dealers and strategic investors located in foreign markets.

     By expanding Autobytel's operations to various other countries, Autobytel
may become subject to laws or treaties that regulate the marketing, distribution
and sale of motor vehicles. Autobytel will need to spend its resources to
determine whether the laws of the countries in which Autobytel seeks to operate
require Autobytel to modify, or prohibit the use of, Autobytel's system. In
addition, the laws of other countries may impose licensing, bonding or similar
requirements on Autobytel as a condition to doing business in these countries.

AUTOBYTEL MAY NOT BE SUCCESSFUL IN EXPANDING ITS BUSINESS ABROAD, WHICH MAY
LIMIT THE COMBINED COMPANIES' FUTURE GROWTH.

     Autobytel has had limited experience in providing its service abroad and
Autobytel cannot be certain that it will be successful in introducing or
marketing its services abroad. In addition, there are risks inherent in
conducting business in international markets, such as:

     - changes in political conditions;

     - regulatory requirements, including with respect to the sale, marketing
       and distribution of motor vehicles and related products and services;

     - potentially weaker intellectual property protections;

     - tariffs and other trade barriers, fluctuations in currency exchange
       rates, or potentially adverse tax consequences;

     - difficulties in managing or overseeing foreign operations; and

     - educating consumers and dealers who may be unfamiliar with the benefits
       of online marketing and commerce.

     One or more of such factors may have a material adverse effect on the
combined companies' current or future international operations and,
consequently, on their business, results of operations and financial condition.

AUTOBYTEL'S FOUNDERS, OFFICERS AND DIRECTORS AND THEIR AFFILIATES AND AUTOWEB'S
OFFICERS AND DIRECTORS WILL HAVE SUBSTANTIAL CONTROL OF AUTOBYTEL'S VOTING STOCK
AFTER THE MERGER IS COMPLETED AND WILL HAVE THE ABILITY TO SIGNIFICANTLY
INFLUENCE AND IN ALL LIKELIHOOD MAKE DECISIONS THAT COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT
STOCKHOLDERS AND AUTOBYTEL'S STOCK PRICE AFTER THE MERGER.

     The continued control of a large amount of Autobytel's stock by insiders
after the merger could have an adverse effect on the market price of Autobytel's
common stock. As of March 31, 2001, Autobytel's executive officers and directors
beneficially own or control approximately 4.0 million shares or 17.9% of the
outstanding shares of Autobytel's common stock. In addition, as of such date,
based on information available to Autobytel, Autobytel's founders, Peter Ellis
and John Bedrosian, beneficially own or control approximately 7.8% and 12.3%,
respectively, of the outstanding shares of Autobytel's common stock. Also,

as of March 31, 2001, Autoweb's executive officers and directors beneficially
own or control approximately 10,100,378 shares or 33.1% of the outstanding
shares of Autoweb's common stock. If the merger were to be completed today,
these shares would be converted into 3,588,664 shares or 17.6% of the
outstanding shares of Autobytel's common stock and the shares held by
Autobytel's officers and directors and their affiliates would represent [  ]% of
the outstanding shares of Autobytel's common stock. Autobytel's officers,
directors, founders and their affiliates, and Autoweb's officers and directors,
assuming they vote together, have the ability to significantly influence and
substantially control the election of Autobytel's board of directors and the
outcome of corporate actions requiring stockholder approval, including mergers
and other changes of corporate control, going private transactions and other
extraordinary transactions.

AUTOBYTEL IS UNCERTAIN OF ITS ABILITY TO OBTAIN ADDITIONAL FINANCING FOR THE
FUTURE CAPITAL NEEDS OF THE COMBINED COMPANIES. IF AUTOBYTEL IS UNABLE TO OBTAIN
ADDITIONAL FINANCING, IT MAY NOT BE ABLE TO CONTINUE TO OPERATE THE COMBINED
BUSINESS.

     Autobytel currently anticipates that the combined companies' cash, cash
equivalents and short-term investments will be sufficient to meet their working
capital and other cash requirements at least for the next twelve months.
Autobytel may need to raise additional funds in order to fund rapid expansion,
to develop new or enhance existing services or products, to respond to
competitive pressures or to acquire complementary products, businesses or
technologies. There can be no assurance that additional financing will be
available on terms favorable to Autobytel, or at all. If adequate funds are not
available or are not available on acceptable terms, Autobytel's ability to fund
expansion, take advantage of additional potential acquisition opportunities,
develop or enhance services or products or respond to competitive pressures
would be significantly limited. Such limitation could have a material adverse
effect on the combined companies' business, results of operations, financial
condition and prospects.

AUTOBYTEL'S CERTIFICATE OF INCORPORATION AND BY-LAWS AND DELAWARE LAW CONTAIN
PROVISIONS THAT COULD DISCOURAGE A THIRD PARTY FROM ACQUIRING AUTOBYTEL OR LIMIT
THE PRICE THIRD PARTIES ARE WILLING TO PAY FOR AUTOBYTEL'S STOCK.

     Provisions of Autobytel's amended and restated certificate of incorporation
and bylaws relating to Autobytel's corporate governance could make it difficult
for a third party to acquire Autobytel and could discourage a third party from
attempting to acquire control of Autobytel. These provisions allow Autobytel to
issue preferred stock with rights senior to those of the common stock without
any further vote or action by the stockholders. These provisions provide that
the board of directors is divided into three classes, which may have the effect
of delaying or preventing changes in control or change in Autobytel's management
because less than a majority of the board of directors are up for election at
each annual meeting. In addition, these provisions impose various procedural and
other requirements which could make it more difficult for stockholders to effect
corporate actions such as a merger, asset sale or other change of control of
Autobytel. Such charter provisions could limit the price that certain investors
might be willing to pay in the future for shares of Autobytel's common stock and
may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control. The issuance
of preferred stock also could decrease the amount of earnings and assets
available for distribution to the holders of common stock or could adversely
affect the rights and powers, including voting rights, of the holders of the
common stock.

     Autobytel is also subject to the anti-takeover provisions of Section 203 of
the Delaware General Corporation Law. In general, the statute prohibits a
publicly held Delaware corporation from engaging in a "business combination"
with an "interested stockholder" for a period of three years after the date of
the transaction in which the person became an interested stockholder, unless the
business combination is approved in a prescribed manner. For purposes of Section
203, a "business combination" includes a merger, asset sale or other transaction
resulting in a financial benefit to the interested stockholder, and an
"interested stockholder" is a person who, together with affiliates and
associates, owns or did own 15% or more of the corporation's voting stock.

AUTOBYTEL, INCLUDING AUTOWEB, MAY BE PARTICULARLY AFFECTED BY GENERAL ECONOMIC
CONDITIONS DUE TO THE NATURE OF THE AUTOMOTIVE INDUSTRY.

     The economic strength of the automotive industry significantly impacts the
revenues Autobytel and Autoweb derive, and will impact the revenues the combined
companies will derive, from dealers, vehicle manufacturers and other strategic
partners, advertising revenues and consumer traffic to their Web sites. The
automotive industry is cyclical, with vehicle sales fluctuating due to changes
in national and global economic forces. Purchases of vehicles are typically
discretionary for consumers and may be particularly affected by negative trends
in the general economy. The success of the combined companies after the merger
depends to a significant extent upon a number of factors relating to
discretionary consumer spending, including economic conditions, and perceptions
of such conditions by consumers, affecting disposable consumer income, such as
employment, wages and salaries, business conditions and interest rates in
regional and local markets.

     In addition, because the purchase of a vehicle is a significant investment
and is relatively discretionary, any reduction in disposable income in general
or a general increase in interest rates or a general tightening of lending may
affect Autobytel, including Autoweb, more significantly than companies in other
industries.

     While 1999 and 2000 were record years for the automotive industry in
general in terms of volume of new vehicles sold, during 2001 the automotive
industry will likely experience significant fall-off in demand for new vehicles.
Autobytel cannot assure that the combined business will not be materially
adversely affected as a result of an industry or general economic downturn.

CURRENT AND FUTURE GOVERNMENT REGULATIONS MAY RESULT IN ADMINISTRATIVE MONETARY
FINES, PENALTIES OR TAXES THAT MAY REDUCE THE COMBINED COMPANIES' FUTURE
EARNINGS AND HARM THE COMBINED COMPANIES' BUSINESS.

     Although there are currently few laws or regulations that apply directly to
the Internet, a number of legislative and regulatory proposals under
consideration by federal, state, local and foreign governmental organizations
may lead to laws or regulations concerning various aspects of the Internet,
including, but not limited to, online content, user privacy, taxation, access
charges, liability for third-party activities and jurisdiction. It is uncertain
how existing laws will be applied to the Internet. The adoption of new local,
state, national or international laws or regulations may decrease the growth of
Internet usage or the acceptance of Internet commerce which could, in turn,
decrease the demand for Autobytel's services, including the Autoweb services,
and increase costs or otherwise have a material adverse effect on the combined
companies' business, results of operations and financial condition. The
applications of existing laws and regulations relating to issues such as user
privacy, defamation, pricing, taxation, promotions, content regulation,
intellectual property ownership and infringement can be unclear. Any existing or
new legislation applicable to the combined companies could expose them to
substantial liability, including significant expenses necessary to comply with
such laws and regulations.

     The tax treatment of the Internet and e-commerce is currently unsettled. A
number of proposals have been made at the federal, state and local levels and by
certain foreign governments that could impose taxes on the sale of goods and
services and certain other Internet activities. The Internet Tax Freedom Act,
signed into law in October 1998, placed a three-year moratorium on new state and
local taxes on Internet commerce. Autobytel cannot assure that future laws
imposing taxes or other regulations on commerce over the Internet would not
substantially impair the growth of e-commerce and the growth of Autobytel's and
Autoweb's combined business.

IF CONSUMERS DO NOT ADOPT INTERNET COMMERCE AS A MAINSTREAM MEDIUM OF COMMERCE
OR IF AUTOMOTIVE INDUSTRY PARTICIPANTS RESIST THE ROLE OF THIRD-PARTY SERVICES,
THE COMBINED COMPANIES' REVENUES MAY NOT GROW AND THEIR EARNINGS MAY SUFFER.

     After the merger, the success of Autobytel's services, including the
Autoweb services, will continue to depend upon the adoption of the Internet by
consumers and dealers as a mainstream medium for commerce and/or the willingness
of automotive manufacturers to cooperate with third party services.

While Autobytel believes that its services, and Autoweb's services, offer
significant advantages to consumers and dealers, there can be no assurance that
widespread acceptance of Internet commerce in general, or of Autobytel's and
Autoweb's services in particular, will occur or that automotive companies will
continue to accept a role for third-party services such as Autobytel and
Autoweb. Autobytel's business model assumes that consumers and dealers who have
historically relied upon traditional means of commerce to purchase or lease
vehicles, and to procure vehicle financing and insurance, will accept new
methods of conducting business and exchanging information and that automotive
manufacturers will accept, rather than resist, a role for all make, all model,
third-party sites such as Autoweb.com and Autobytel.com which invite
comparisons. If the market for third-party Internet-based vehicle marketing
services fails to develop further, develops slower than expected, faces
opposition or becomes saturated with competitors, or if the combined companies'
services do not achieve market acceptance, their business, results of operations
and financial condition will be materially and adversely affected.

INTERNET-RELATED ISSUES MAY REDUCE OR SLOW THE GROWTH IN THE USE OF AUTOBYTEL'S
OR AUTOWEB'S SERVICES IN THE FUTURE.

     Critical issues concerning the commercial use of the Internet, such as,
ease of access, security, reliability, cost, and quality of service, remain
unresolved and may impact the growth of Internet use. If Internet usage
continues to increase rapidly, the Internet infrastructure may not be able to
support the demands placed on it by this growth, and its performance and
reliability may decline. The recent growth in Internet traffic has caused
frequent periods of decreased performance, outages and delays. Autobytel's
ability to increase the speed with which the combined companies provide services
to consumers and to increase the scope and quality of such services is limited
by and dependent upon the speed and reliability of the Internet, which is beyond
Autobytel's control. If periods of decreased performance, outages or delays on
the Internet occur frequently, overall Internet usage or usage of Autobytel's
Web sites, including Autoweb's sites, could increase more slowly or decline.

IF AUTOBYTEL IS UNABLE TO KEEP PACE WITH ADVANCES IN TECHNOLOGY, CONSUMERS MAY
STOP USING THE COMBINED COMPANIES' SERVICES AND REVENUES WILL DECREASE.

     The Internet and electronic commerce markets are characterized by rapid
technological change, changes in user and customer requirements, frequent new
service and product introductions embodying new technologies and the emergence
of new industry standards and practices that could render Autobytel's or
Autoweb's existing Web sites and technology obsolete. These market
characteristics are exacerbated by the emerging nature of the market and the
fact that many companies are expected to introduce new Internet products and
services in the near future. If Autobytel is unable to adapt to changing
technologies, the combined companies' business, results of operations and
financial condition could be materially and adversely affected.

     Autobytel's performance after the merger will depend, in part, on its
ability to continue to enhance Autobytel's and Autoweb's existing services,
develop new technology that addresses the increasingly sophisticated and varied
needs of prospective customers, license leading technologies and respond to
technological advances and emerging industry standards and practices on a timely
and cost-effective basis. The development of Autobytel's Web sites, Dealer Real
Time and iManager systems, Autoweb's technology and other proprietary technology
entails significant technical and business risks. Autobytel may not be
successful in using new technologies effectively or adapting its technology,
Autoweb's technology or other proprietary technology to customer requirements or
to emerging industry standards. In addition, the widespread adoption of
developing multimedia-enabling technologies could require fundamental and costly
changes in its technology and affect the nature, viability and measurability of
Internet-based advertising, which could adversely affect the combined companies'
business, results of operations and financial condition.

AUTOBYTEL IS VULNERABLE TO ELECTRICITY BLACKOUTS AND COMMUNICATIONS SYSTEM
INTERRUPTIONS BECAUSE THE MAJORITY OF AUTOBYTEL'S PRIMARY SERVERS ARE LOCATED IN
A SINGLE LOCATION, AND AUTOWEB'S SERVERS ARE ALSO VULNERABLE TO SUCH
INTERRUPTIONS. IF ELECTRICITY OR COMMUNICATIONS TO AUTOBYTEL'S OR AUTOWEB'S
SERVERS WERE INTERRUPTED, THE COMBINED COMPANIES' OPERATIONS COULD BE ADVERSELY
AFFECTED.

     Autobytel presently hosts the majority of Autobytel's production Web sites
including Autobytel.com, Dealer Real Time and iManager systems at Autobytel's
corporate headquarters in Irvine, California. The Autoweb and Carsmart Web sites
are hosted by a third party service provider. Although offsite backup servers
are available from outside sources, primary servers located at Autobytel's
corporate headquarters are vulnerable to interruption by damage from fire,
earthquake, flood, power loss, telecommunications failure, break-ins and other
events beyond Autobytel's control. In the event that Autobytel or Autoweb
experiences significant system disruptions, their business, results of
operations and financial condition would be materially and adversely affected.
Autobytel has, from time to time, experienced periodic systems interruptions and
anticipates that such interruptions will occur in the future. As a result of a
variety of factors, available electricity supply in California is not sufficient
to meet demand at all times in some areas, and these constraints are projected
to continue for several years. The supply constraints have been managed, and
will likely continue to be managed, by a combination of obtaining additional
supplies, requested conservation, interruption of certain customers whose rates
include that possibility, and as a last resort, interruption of some or all
customers in certain areas through "rolling blackouts." Relieving the supply
constraints is likely to cause increases in the retail rates to be paid. To
date, neither Autobytel nor Autoweb has been significantly affected by rolling
blackouts or other interruptions in service related to the constraints on supply
and Autobytel has a backup generator available to protect itself against rolling
blackouts that last for a limited amount of time. Autoweb's and CarSmart's
service provider maintains backup generation capability, however, recently the
provider suffered a power disruption that caused its backup system to fail. This
outage did not have a material adverse effect on Autoweb or CarSmart. Autobytel
maintains business interruption insurance which pays up to $6 million for the
actual loss of business income sustained due to the suspension of operations as
a result of direct physical loss of or damage to property at Autobytel's
offices. However, in the event of a prolonged interruption, this business
interruption insurance may not be sufficient to fully compensate Autobytel for
the resulting losses to the combined companies.

AUTOBYTEL'S COMPUTER INFRASTRUCTURE MAY BE VULNERABLE TO SECURITY BREACHES. ANY
SUCH PROBLEMS COULD JEOPARDIZE CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION TRANSMITTED OVER THE
INTERNET, CAUSE INTERRUPTIONS IN AUTOBYTEL'S OPERATIONS OR CAUSE AUTOBYTEL TO
HAVE LIABILITY TO THIRD PERSONS.

     Autobytel's computer infrastructure, including the Autoweb infrastructure,
is potentially vulnerable to physical or electronic computer break-ins, viruses
and similar disruptive problems and security breaches. Any such problems or
security breaches could cause Autobytel or Autoweb to have liability to one or
more third parties and disrupt all or part of their operations after the merger.
Any of these events would have a material adverse effect on the combined
companies' business, results of operations and financial condition. A party who
is able to circumvent security measures could misappropriate proprietary
information, jeopardize the confidential nature of information transmitted over
the Internet or cause interruptions in the combined companies' operations.
Concerns over the security of Internet transactions and the privacy of users
could also inhibit the growth of the Internet in general, particularly as a
means of conducting commercial transactions. To the extent that Autobytel's or
Autoweb's activities or those of third party contractors involve the storage and
transmission of proprietary information such as personal financial information,
security breaches could expose them to a risk of financial loss, litigation and
other liabilities. Autobytel may be required to incur significant costs to
protect against security breaches or to alleviate problems caused by breaches.
Any well-publicized compromise of security could deter people from using the Web
to conduct transactions that involve transmitting confidential information such
as credit card information or downloading sensitive materials, which would cause
Autobytel's business, results of operations and financial condition to suffer.
Autobytel's insurance does not currently protect, and after the merger is not
expected to protect, against such losses.

AUTOBYTEL MAY INCUR LIABILITY FOR RETRIEVING AND TRANSMITTING INFORMATION OVER
THE INTERNET.

     The combined companies could face liability for information retrieved from
or transmitted over the Internet and liability for products sold over the
Internet. This could include liability with respect to third-party information
that may be accessible through Autobytel's Web sites, including the Autoweb
sites, links or car review services. Such claims might assert, among other
things, that, by directly or indirectly providing links to Web sites operated by
third parties, Autobytel should be liable for copyright or trademark
infringement or other wrongful actions by such third parties through such Web
sites. It is also possible that, if any third-party content information provided
on Autobytel Web sites, including the Autoweb sites, contains errors, consumers
could make claims against Autobytel for losses incurred in reliance on such
information.

     Autobytel and Autoweb also enter into agreements with other companies under
which any revenue that results from the purchase of services through direct
links to or from their Web sites is shared. Such arrangements may expose the
combined companies to additional legal risks and uncertainties, including local,
state, federal and foreign government regulation and potential liabilities to
consumers of these services, even if they do not provide the services
themselves. Autobytel cannot assure that any indemnification provided in
Autobytel's or Autoweb's agreements with these parties, if available, will be
adequate.

     Even to the extent such claims do not result in liability to the combined
companies, they could incur significant costs in investigating and defending
against such claims. The imposition after the merger, of potential liability for
information carried on or disseminated through Autobytel's system could require
measures to reduce exposure to such liability, which might require the
expenditure of substantial resources or limit the attractiveness of Autobytel's
services to consumers, dealers, and others.

     Autobytel's and Autoweb's general liability insurance and Autoweb's
communications liability insurance may not cover all potential claims to which
they are exposed and will be exposed after the merger and may not be adequate to
indemnify for all liability that may be imposed. Any imposition of liability
that is not covered by insurance or is in excess of insurance coverage could
have a material adverse effect on the combined companies' post-merger business,
results of operations and financial condition.

MISAPPROPRIATION OF AUTOBYTEL'S OR AUTOWEB'S INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY AND
PROPRIETARY RIGHTS COULD IMPAIR AUTOBYTEL'S POST-MERGER COMPETITIVE POSITION.

     Autobytel's and Autoweb's ability to compete depends upon proprietary
systems and technology. While both companies rely on trademark, trade secret and
copyright law, confidentiality agreements and technical measures to protect
proprietary rights, Autobytel believes that the technical and creative skills of
personnel, continued development of proprietary systems and technology, brand
name recognition and reliable Web site maintenance are more essential in
establishing and maintaining a leadership position and strengthening Autobytel's
post-merger brands. Despite Autobytel's efforts to protect its proprietary
rights, unauthorized parties may attempt to copy aspects of Autobytel's services
or to obtain and use information that Autobytel regards as proprietary. Policing
unauthorized use of Autobytel's proprietary rights is difficult.

     Autobytel cannot assure that the steps taken by Autobytel will prevent
misappropriation of technology or that the agreements entered into for that
purpose will be enforceable. Misappropriation of Autobytel's or Autoweb's
intellectual property or potential litigation could have a material adverse
effect on the combined companies' post-merger business, results of operations
and financial condition. Effective trademark, service mark, copyright and trade
secret protection may not be available in every country in which Autobytel's
post-merger products and services are made available online. In addition,
litigation may be necessary in the future to enforce or protect Autobytel's
intellectual property rights or to defend against claims or infringement or
invalidity. As part of their confidentiality procedures, Autobytel and Autoweb
generally enter into agreements with their employees and consultants and limit
access to trade secrets and technology.

AUTOBYTEL FACES RISKS OF CLAIMS FROM THIRD PARTIES RELATING TO INTELLECTUAL
PROPERTY THAT COULD HARM ITS POST-MERGER BUSINESS.

     As part of their business, Autobytel and Autoweb make Internet services and
content available to their customers. This creates the potential for claims to
be made against Autobytel or Autoweb, either directly or through contractual
indemnification provisions with partners. Any claims could result in costly
litigation, divert management's attention and resources, cause delays in
releasing new or upgrading existing services or require Autobytel to enter into
royalty or licensing agreements after the merger. These claims might, for
example, be made for defamation, negligence, patent, copyright or trademark
infringement, personal injury, breach of contract, unfair competition, false
advertising, invasion of privacy or other legal theories based on the nature,
content or copying of these materials. Liability, particularly if not covered by
Autobytel's or Autoweb's insurance or in excess of Autobytel's or Autoweb's
insurance coverage, could damage the post-merger business. In the past,
plaintiffs have brought these types of claims and sometimes successfully
litigated them against online services. Although Autobytel and Autoweb carry
general liability insurance, which is expected to be the practice after the
merger, insurance may not cover claims of these types or may be inadequate to
indemnify Autobytel for all liability that may be imposed.

     Litigation regarding intellectual property rights is common in the Internet
and software industries. Autobytel expects that Internet technologies and
software products and services may be increasingly subject to third-party
infringement claims as the number of competitors in Autobytel's industry segment
grows and the functionality of products in different industry segments overlaps.
There can be no assurance that Autobytel's services (including, after the
merger, Autoweb's services) do not infringe on the intellectual property rights
of third parties.

AUTOBYTEL AND AUTOWEB OR THEIR COMBINED BUSINESSES COULD BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED
BY LITIGATION.

     From time to time, Autobytel and Autoweb are involved in various legal
proceedings arising from the normal course of their business activities. In
addition, in April and May 2001, ______ purported class action lawsuits were
filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York
against Autoweb, some of Autoweb's current and former directors and officers and
the underwriters involved in Autoweb's initial public offering. The complaints
allege violations of the Securities Act of 1933 and of the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934 involving alleged undisclosed compensation to the underwriters and
seek unspecified damages. Also, Autobytel is a defendant in two state court
lawsuits described on page   . Autobytel and Autoweb believe that they have
meritorious defenses to the complaints and intend to vigorously defend the
actions; however, this and other litigation, even if not meritorious, could
result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and management attention
and an adverse outcome in litigation could materially affect the combined
companies' business, results of operations and financial condition.

IF AUTOBYTEL OR THE INTERNET INFRASTRUCTURE IS UNABLE TO HANDLE AN UNEXPECTEDLY
LARGE INCREASE IN VOLUME OF CONSUMERS USING AUTOBYTEL'S WEB SITES, AUTOBYTEL
CANNOT ASSURE ITS CONSUMERS OR DEALERS THAT PURCHASE REQUESTS WILL BE
EFFICIENTLY PROCESSED AND AUTOBYTEL'S POST-MERGER BUSINESS MAY SUFFER.

     If the Internet continues to experience significant growth in the number of
users and the level of use, then the Internet infrastructure may not be able to
continue to support the demands placed on it by such potential growth. The
Internet may not prove to be a viable commercial medium because of inadequate
development of the necessary infrastructure, timely development of complementary
products such as high speed modems, delays in the development or adoption of new
standards and protocols required to handle increased levels of Internet activity
or increased government regulation.

     An unexpectedly large increase in the volume or pace of traffic on
Autobytel's Web sites, including increases arising from the number of orders
placed by Autoweb customers, may require Autobytel to expand and further upgrade
Autobytel's technology, transaction-processing systems and network
infrastructure. Autobytel may not be able to accurately project the rate or
timing of increases, if any, in the use of its Web sites, including Autoweb Web
sites, or expand and upgrade Autobytel's systems and infrastructure

to accommodate such increases. In addition, Autobytel cannot assure that its
dealers will efficiently process purchase requests.

EVOLVING GOVERNMENT REGULATIONS MAY REQUIRE FUTURE LICENSING WHICH COULD
INCREASE ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS OR ADVERSELY AFFECT AUTOBYTEL'S REVENUES.

     In a regulatory climate that is uncertain, Autobytel's and Autoweb's
operations may be subject to direct and indirect adoption, expansion or
reinterpretation of various domestic and foreign laws and regulations.
Compliance with these future laws and regulations may require Autobytel to
obtain appropriate licenses at an undeterminable and possibly significant
initial monetary and annual expense. These additional monetary expenditures may
increase future overhead, thereby potentially reducing the combined companies'
future results of operations.

     Autobytel has identified what Autobytel believes are the areas of domestic
government regulation, which if changed, would be costly to the combined
companies. These laws and regulations include franchise laws, motor vehicle
brokerage licensing laws, insurance licensing laws, financial services law and
motor vehicle dealership licensing laws, which are or may be applicable to
aspects of Autobytel's business. There could be laws and regulations applicable
to the combined companies' business which Autobytel has not identified or which,
if changed, may be costly.

     The introduction of new services and expansion of Autobytel's operations to
foreign countries may require Autobytel to comply with additional, yet
undetermined, laws and regulations. Compliance may require obtaining appropriate
business licenses, filing of bonds, appointment of foreign agents and periodic
business reporting activity. The failure to adequately comply with these future
laws and regulations may delay or possibly prevent some of Autobytel's products
or services from being offered in a particular foreign country, thereby having
an adverse affect on the combined companies' results of operations.

CHANGING LEGISLATION IN THE AUTOMOTIVE INDUSTRY COULD REQUIRE INCREASED
REGULATORY AND LOBBYING COSTS AND MAY HARM THE COMBINED COMPANIES' BUSINESS.

     Autobytel's and Autoweb's purchasing services may result in changing the
way vehicles are sold which may be viewed as threatening by new and used vehicle
dealers who do not subscribe to Autobytel's or Autoweb's services. Such
businesses are often represented by influential lobbying organizations, and such
organizations or other persons may propose legislation which could impact the
evolving marketing and distribution model which Autobytel's or Autoweb's
services promote. Should current laws be changed or new laws passed, Autobytel's
business, results of operations and financial condition could be materially and
adversely affected. As Autobytel introduces new services, it may need to comply
with additional licensing regulations and regulatory requirements.

     To date, neither Autobytel nor Autoweb has spent significant resources on
lobbying or related government affairs issues but Autobytel may need to do so in
the future. A significant increase in the amount Autobytel spends on lobbying or
related activities would have a material adverse effect on the combined
companies' results of operations and financial condition.

IF FEDERAL OR STATE FRANCHISE LAWS APPLY TO THE COMBINED COMPANIES, THEY MAY BE
REQUIRED TO MODIFY OR ELIMINATE THEIR MARKETING PROGRAMS, WHICH MAY CAUSE THE
COMBINED COMPANIES' REVENUES TO DECREASE AND THEIR BUSINESS TO SUFFER.

     Autobytel believes that neither the combined companies' relationship with
their dealers nor their dealer subscription agreements constitute "franchises"
under federal or state franchise laws and that neither Autobytel nor Autoweb is
subject to the coverage of state motor vehicle dealer licensing laws. Through a
subsidiary, Autobytel is licensed as a motor vehicle dealer and broker. However,
if any state's regulatory requirements relating to franchises or Autobytel's or
the combined companies' method of business impose additional requirements on
them or include them within an industry-specific regulatory scheme, they may be
required to modify their marketing programs in such states in a manner which
undermines the programs' attractiveness to consumers or dealers. If the combined
companies become

subject to fines or other penalties or if they determine that the licensing and
related requirements are overly burdensome, they may elect to terminate
operations in such state. In each case, the combined companies' revenues may
decline and their business, results of operations and financial condition could
be materially and adversely affected.

     A federal court of appeals in Michigan has ruled that Autobytel's dealer
subscription agreement is not a "franchise" under Michigan law. However, if the
combined companies' relationship or written agreement with their dealers were
found to be a "franchise" under federal or state franchise laws, then Autobytel
could be subject to other regulations, such as franchise disclosure and
registration requirements and limitations on Autobytel's ability to effect
changes in their relationships with their dealers. Autobytel also believes that
Autobytel's and Autoweb's dealer marketing services do not qualify as an
automobile brokerage activity and, therefore, state broker licensing
requirements do not apply to Autobytel or Autoweb. Through a subsidiary,
Autobytel is licensed as a motor vehicle dealer and broker. In response to Texas
Department of Transportation concerns, Autobytel and Autoweb modified their
marketing programs in that state to include a pricing model under which all
dealers in Texas are charged uniform fees based on the population density of
their particular geographic area and to make their programs open to all dealers
who wish to apply.

IF FINANCIAL BROKER AND INSURANCE LICENSING REQUIREMENTS APPLY TO THE COMBINED
COMPANIES IN STATES WHERE THEY ARE NOT CURRENTLY LICENSED, THEY WILL BE REQUIRED
TO OBTAIN ADDITIONAL LICENSES AND THEIR BUSINESS MAY SUFFER.

     State regulatory requirements may include Autobytel or Autoweb within an
industry-specific regulatory scheme, such as those for vehicle insurance or
vehicle financing industries. In the event that individual states' regulatory
requirements change or additional requirements are imposed on the combined
company after the merger, Autobytel may be required to modify aspects of the
combined companies' business in those states in a manner that might undermine
the attractiveness of the purchase process to consumers, dealers, vehicle
manufacturers or advertisers or require Autobytel to terminate the combined
companies' operations in that state, either of which could have a material
adverse effect on the combined companies' business, results of operations and
financial condition.

     Autobytel provides a link on some of Autobytel's Web sites so consumers can
receive real time quotes for insurance coverage from Channelpoint Corporation
and submit quote applications online. Participants in the program include The
Hartford (Hartford Financial Services Group, Inc.), The GE Auto Insurance
Program and Ekemper. Autoweb has similar programs. Autobytel and Autoweb receive
fees from such participants in connection with this advertising activity.

     Autobytel does not believe that the above activities require Autobytel or
Autoweb to be licensed under state insurance laws. The use of the Internet in
the marketing of insurance products, however, is a relatively new practice. It
is not clear whether or to what extent state insurance licensing laws apply to
activities similar to Autobytel's or Autoweb's. Given these uncertainties,
Autobytel currently holds, through a wholly-owned subsidiary, insurance agent
licenses or is otherwise authorized to transact insurance in 47 states and the
District of Columbia.

     Due to the complexity, periodic modification and differing interpretations
of these laws, Autobytel or Autoweb may not always be in compliance with all of
these laws. Failure to comply with these numerous laws could result in fines,
additional licensing requirements or the revocation of Autobytel's license in a
particular jurisdiction or jurisdictions. These penalties could significantly
increase the combined companies' general operating expenses and harm their
business. In addition, even if the allegations in any regulatory action against
Autobytel or Autoweb turned out to be false, negative publicity relating to any
allegations could result in a loss of consumer confidence and significant damage
to Autobytel's brands. Autobytel believes that because many consumers and
insurance companies are not yet comfortable with the concept of purchasing
insurance online, the publicity relating to any regulatory or legal issues would
harm the combined companies' business.

     As a company that expects to offer its customers the opportunity to
purchase insurance over the Internet, Autobytel expects to be subject to
additional regulatory risks, as insurance regulations have not been fully
modified to cover Internet transactions. Currently, many state insurance
regulators are exploring the need for specific regulation of insurance sales
over the Internet. Any new regulation could dampen the growth of the Internet as
a means of providing insurance services. This could materially and adversely
affect the combined companies' business, results of operations and financial
condition.

THE PUBLIC MARKET FOR AUTOBYTEL'S COMMON STOCK MAY CONTINUE TO BE VOLATILE,
ESPECIALLY SINCE MARKET PRICES FOR INTERNET-RELATED AND TECHNOLOGY STOCKS HAVE
OFTEN BEEN UNRELATED TO OPERATING PERFORMANCE.

     Autobytel cannot assure that an active trading market will be sustained or
that the market price of its common stock will not decline.

     Recently, the stock market in general and the shares of Internet companies
in particular have experienced significant price fluctuations. The market price
of Autobytel's common stock is expected to continue to be highly volatile and
could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to factors such as:

     - actual or anticipated variations in Autobytel's annual or quarterly
       operating results;

     - Autobytel's historical and anticipated operating metrics such as the
       number of subscribing dealers, the visitors to Autobytel's Web sites and
       the frequency with which they transact;

     - announcements of new product or service offerings;

     - technological innovations;

     - competitive developments, including actions by automotive manufacturers;

     - changes in financial estimates by securities analysts;

     - conditions and trends in the Internet and electronic commerce industries;

     - adoption of new accounting standards affecting the technology or
       automotive industry; and

     - general market conditions and other factors.

     Further, the stock markets, and in particular the Nasdaq National Market on
which Autobytel's common stock is traded, have experienced extreme price and
volume fluctuations that have particularly affected the market prices of equity
securities of many technology companies and have often been unrelated or
disproportionate to the operating performance of such companies. These broad
market factors have and may continue to adversely affect the market price of
Autobytel's common stock. In addition, general economic, political and market
conditions such as recessions, interest rates or international currency
fluctuations, may adversely affect the market price of the common stock. In the
past, following periods of volatility in the market price of a company's
securities, securities class action litigation has often been instituted against
companies with publicly traded securities. Such litigation, if instituted, could
result in substantial costs and a diversion of management's attention and
resources, which would have a material adverse effect on Autobytel's business,
results of operations and financial condition.

IF AUTOBYTEL IS UNABLE TO MAINTAIN ITS NASDAQ NATIONAL MARKET LISTING, THE
LIQUIDITY OF AUTOBYTEL'S COMMON STOCK WOULD BE SERIOUSLY LIMITED.

     Autobytel cannot assure that it will be able to comply with the minimum bid
price requirement for continued listing on the Nasdaq National Market. In the
event Autobytel's shares are delisted from the Nasdaq National Market, Autobytel
anticipates that it would attempt to have its common stock traded on the NASD
over-the counter Bulletin Board. If Autobytel's common stock is delisted, it
would seriously limit the liquidity of its common stock and limit Autobytel's
potential to raise future capital through the sale of its common stock, which
could have a material adverse effect on Autobytel's business.

SALES OR THE PERCEPTION OF FUTURE SALES OF AUTOBYTEL'S COMMON STOCK MAY DEPRESS
AUTOBYTEL'S STOCK PRICE. SINCE THE MARKET PRICES FOR INTERNET-RELATED STOCKS ARE
LIKELY TO REMAIN VOLATILE, AUTOBYTEL'S STOCK PRICE MAY BE MORE ADVERSELY
AFFECTED THAN THE STOCK PRICE OF OTHER COMPANIES BY SUCH FUTURE SALES.

     Sale of substantial numbers of shares of common stock in the public market
could adversely affect the market price of Autobytel's common stock and make it
more difficult for Autobytel to raise funds through equity offerings in the
future. Of the [            ] shares of Autobytel common stock that were
outstanding as of [            ], 2001, approximately [            ] million
shares are eligible for sale in the public market without restriction and
approximately [            ] million shares are subject to restrictions on sale
in the public market in accordance with the provisions of Rule 144 under the
Securities Act of 1933. In addition, holders of approximately [     ] million
shares of common stock are entitled to certain registration rights with respect
to such shares until such time as the holders of such common stock may sell such
shares under Rule 144 of the Securities Act. There are approximately [     ]
million shares of Autoweb common stock that were outstanding on [       ] 2001.
If the merger were to be completed today, approximately [     ] million shares
of Autobytel common stock would be issued to the Autoweb shareholders, of which
approximately [     ] million shares would be subject to the volume limitations
of Rule 144 by virtue of Rule 145.

ADDITIONAL FACTORS TO CONSIDER IF THE MERGER IS NOT COMPLETED

     If the merger is not completed for any reason, Autoweb will be subject to a
number of material risks, including:

     - the provision in the merger agreement that Autoweb could be required to
       pay Autobytel a termination fee of up to $1 million and/or that Autoweb
       could be required to reimburse Autobytel for costs and expenses incurred
       in connection with the merger;

     - the market price of Autoweb common stock may decline to the extent that
       the current market price of such shares may reflect a market assumption
       that the merger will be completed;

     - costs related to the merger, such as legal and accounting fees and a
       portion of the investment banking fees, must be paid even if the merger
       is not completed;

     - benefits that Autoweb expects to realize from the merger, such as the
       potentially enhanced financial and competitive position of the combined
       companies, would not be realized;

     - the diversion of management attention from day-to-day business, and the
       potential to disrupt employees and relationships with customers and
       dealers during the period before consummation of the merger, may affect
       the financial and market position of Autoweb if the merger does not
       occur; and

     - if the merger is terminated and the Autoweb board of directors seeks
       another merger or business combination, Autoweb stockholders cannot be
       certain that Autoweb will be able to find a partner willing to pay an
       equivalent or more attractive price than the price to be paid by
       Autobytel in the merger.

     Additionally, failing to complete the merger could adversely affect
Autoweb's continued listing on the Nasdaq National Market.

     In considering these factors, stockholders should be aware that either
Autobytel or Autoweb can terminate the merger for various reasons, as discussed
on page   .

        UNAUDITED PRO FORMA CONSOLIDATED CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

OVERVIEW

     On April 11, 2001, Autobytel entered into an agreement to acquire Autoweb
in a merger transaction. As part of the merger, a separately formed Delaware
corporation, Autobytel Acquisition I Corp., will be merged with and into
Autoweb. The separate corporate existence of Autobytel Acquisition I Corp. shall
cease and Autoweb will continue as the surviving corporation and become a wholly
owned subsidiary of Autobytel.

     The accompanying unaudited pro forma consolidated condensed balance sheet
assumes that the merger took place as of March 31, 2001. The unaudited pro forma
consolidated condensed balance sheet combines the unaudited consolidated balance
sheet of Autobytel as of March 31, 2001 and the unaudited balance sheet of
Autoweb as of March 31, 2001.

     The accompanying unaudited pro forma consolidated condensed statements of
operations present the consolidated statement of operations of Autobytel for the
three months ended March 31, 2001 and the audited statement of operations for
the year ended December 31, 2000 combined with Autoweb's unaudited statement of
operations for the three months ended March 31, 2001 and audited statement of
operations for the year ended December 31, 2000. The unaudited pro forma
consolidated condensed statements of operations give effect to the merger as if
it had occurred as of January 1, 2000.

     The unaudited pro forma consolidated condensed balance sheet and statements
of operations are not necessarily indicative of the financial position and
operating results that would have been achieved had the transaction been in
effect as of the dates indicated and should not be construed as being a
representation of the financial position or future operating results of the
combined company.

     The unaudited pro forma consolidated condensed financial information should
be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and
related notes of Autobytel and Autoweb included elsewhere in this joint proxy
statement/prospectus.

THE MERGER

     The merger will be structured as a stock-for-stock exchange. Autobytel will
issue 0.3553 shares of Autobytel common stock, par value $0.001 per share, for
each share of Autoweb common stock outstanding as of the effective date of the
merger. The merger is expected to be accounted for as an acquisition under the
purchase method of accounting for business combinations with an estimated
purchase price of $16.3 million.

     The pro forma adjustments are based on currently available information and
certain assumptions that Autobytel's management believes are reasonable. Pro
forma adjustments for the merger include:

     - The preliminary purchase price allocation based on management's current
       estimates of the fair realizable value of Autoweb's net assets, based on
       the estimated 10.5 million shares of Autobytel common stock to be issued
       which are valued at $14.3 million and the $2 million transaction costs
       paid by Autobytel for a total estimated value of $16.3 million.

     - The incurrence of approximately $4.2 million in estimated combined
       transaction costs, including investment banking, legal, accounting and
       registration fees.

     - The elimination of unamortized goodwill recorded by Autoweb from previous
       acquisitions.

     - The estimated exit costs of anticipated facilities integration, personnel
       costs, and other expenses directly related to the contemplated
       consolidation of significant operations of the merged companies.

     Management expects that the strategic benefits of the merger will result in
incremental revenue and expense saving opportunities for the combined companies.
Those opportunities include, but are not limited to, the ability to
cross-promote the combined companies' products and services, the ability to
offer consumers an expanded array of services and the ability to service the
broader customer base in a more

cost effective manner. However, such incremental revenues and cost savings have
not been reflected in the accompanying pro forma consolidated condensed
statements of operations presented herein.

     Under the purchase method of accounting, the estimated cost of
approximately $16.3 million to acquire Autoweb, including transaction costs
incurred by Autobytel, will be allocated to its underlying net assets in
proportion to their respective fair values. Any excess of the purchase price
over the estimated fair value of the net assets acquired will be recorded as
goodwill. A preliminary allocation of the excess of the purchase price,
including transaction costs, over the book value of the net assets to be
acquired has been made to goodwill.

     At this time, the work needed to provide the basis for estimating these
fair values and the related amortization period has not been completed. As a
result, the final allocation of the excess purchase price over the book value of
the net assets acquired could differ materially. The pro forma consolidated
condensed financial statements reflect a preliminary allocation to goodwill
assuming a weighted-average amortization period of fifteen years. The final
purchase price allocation may result in a different weighted-average
amortization period than that presented. Accordingly, a change in the
amortization period would impact the amount of annual amortization expense.

       NOTES TO THE PRO FORMA CONSOLIDATED CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
                                  (UNAUDITED)

(a) Reflects the historical financial position of Autobytel as of March 31,
    2001.

(b) Reflects the historical financial position of Autoweb as of March 31, 2001.

(c) Pro forma adjustments to record the merger as of March 31, 2001 reflect:

     - an increase in stockholders' equity of approximately $14.3 million
       relating to the issuance of approximately 10.5 million shares of
       Autobytel's common stock, based on an exchange ratio of 1 to 0.3553. The
       Autobytel common stock to be issued was valued based on a price per share
       of $1.36, which was the average market price for three days before and
       after the date the acquisition agreement was announced,

     - an increase in accounts receivable allowance for doubtful accounts of
       approximately $1.0 million as a result of conforming from Autoweb's
       policy to Autobytel's,

     - a decrease in property and equipment of $1.7 million relating to the
       adjustment to estimated fair market value,

     - an increase in accrued expenses of approximately $4.2 million relating to
       the incurrence of transaction costs, including investment banking, legal,
       accounting and registration fees,

     - an increase in accrued expenses of $9.2 million primarily relating to the
       estimated exit costs contemplated in conjunction with the consolidation
       of operations and integration of facilities,

     - the elimination of approximately $10.1 million of Autoweb's pre-existing
       goodwill,

     - the preliminary allocation of $2.0 million to goodwill which is equal to
       the excess of the $16.3 million purchase price, including transaction
       costs, over the book value of the net assets acquired and,

     - a decrease in stockholders' equity of approximately $24.2 million
       relating to the elimination of Autoweb's historical shareholders' equity.

     The final allocation of the purchase price will be determined after the
completion of the merger and will be based on a comprehensive final evaluation
of the fair value of the tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired
and liabilities assumed at the time of the merger. The preliminary allocation is
summarized as follows (in millions):

Purchase price:
  Common stock..............................................  $14.3
  Transaction costs paid by Autobytel.......................    2.0
                                                              -----
     Total purchase price...................................  $16.3
                                                              =====
Allocation of purchase price:
Assets:
  Cash......................................................  $13.2
  Accounts receivable.......................................    7.5
  Prepaid expenses and other................................    6.1
  Goodwill..................................................    2.0
Liabilities:
  Historical liabilities....................................   (4.0)
  Liabilities from transactional costs......................   (2.2)
  Liabilities from exit costs and restructuring.............   (9.2)
Stockholders equity:
  Notes receivable from stockholder.........................    0.7
  Deferred compensation.....................................    2.2
     Total purchase price...................................  $16.3
                                                              =====

(d) Reflects the historical operating results of Autobytel for the three months
    ended March 31, 2001 and the year ended December 31, 2000.

(e) Reflects the historical operating results of Autoweb for the three months
    ended March 31, 2001 and the year ended December 31, 2000, including various
    reclassifications that have been made to conform Autoweb to Autobytel's
    consolidated condensed financial statement presentation.

(f) Pro forma adjustments to record the merger for the three months ended March
    31, 2001 and the year ended December 31, 2000 to reflect:

     - Increases of $34,000 and $136,000, respectively, in the amortization of
       goodwill relating to the excess of the purchase price to acquire Autoweb
       over the book value of its net assets acquired, which has been allocated
       to goodwill and is being amortized on a straight-line basis over a 15
       year weighted-average period;

     - Decreases of $1.8 million and $7.0 million, respectively, in the
       amortization of goodwill and other intangible assets relating to the
       elimination of Autoweb's pre-existing goodwill and other intangible
       assets,

     - Increases of $16,000 and $62,000 respectively, in depreciation of fixed
       assets acquired and,

     - Decreases of $496,000 and $1.9 million, respectively, in the depreciation
       of fixed assets resulting from an adjustment to the estimated fair market
       value.

     In addition, pro forma net loss per common share has been adjusted to
reflect the issuance of additional shares of Autobytel common stock in the
merger based on Autobytel's weighted average shares outstanding for the periods
presented and an exchange ratio of 1 to 0.3553. Because the effect of stock
options would be antidilutive, dilutive per share amounts on a pro forma basis
are the same as basic per share amounts.

                           COMPARATIVE PER SHARE DATA

     The following table reflects (a) the historical net loss and book value per
share of Autobytel common stock and the historical net loss and book value per
share of Autoweb common stock in comparison with the unaudited pro forma net
loss and book value per share after giving effect to Autobytel's proposed merger
with Autoweb, and (b) the equivalent historical net loss and book value per
share attributable to 0.3553 shares of Autobytel common stock which will be
received for each share of Autoweb common stock.

     The historical book value per share is computed by dividing stockholders'
equity as of March 31, 2001 and December 31, 2000, by the actual common stock
outstanding. The pro forma per share loss from continuing operations is computed
by dividing the pro forma loss from continuing operations by the pro forma
weighted average number of shares outstanding, assuming Autobytel had merged
with Autoweb at the beginning of the earliest period presented. The pro forma
combined book value per share is computed by dividing total pro forma
stockholders' equity by the pro forma number of common shares outstanding at
March 31, 2001 and December 31, 2000 assuming the merger had occurred on January
1, 2000. The Autoweb equivalent pro forma combined per share amounts are
calculated by multiplying the Autobytel pro forma combined per share amounts by
the exchange ratio of 0.3553.

     The following information should be read in conjunction with the separate
audited historical consolidated financial statements and related notes of
Autobytel and Autoweb, the unaudited pro forma consolidated condensed financial
information and related notes of Autobytel and the selected historical and
selected unaudited pro forma financial data included elsewhere in this joint
proxy statement/prospectus. The pro forma information is presented for
illustrative purposes only and is not necessarily indicative of the operating
results or financial position that would have occurred if the merger of Autoweb
had been consummated as of the beginning of the earliest period presented, nor
is it necessarily indicative of the future operating results or financial
position of the combined company.

     Autoweb stockholders are advised to obtain current market quotations for
Autobytel common stock and Autoweb common stock. No assurance can be given as to
the market prices of Autobytel common stock or Autoweb common stock at any time
before the consummation of the merger or as to the market price of Autobytel
common stock at any time after the merger. Because the exchange ratio is fixed,
the exchange ratio will not be adjusted to compensate Autoweb stockholders for
decreases in the market price of Autobytel common stock which have and could
occur further before the merger becomes effective. In the event the market price
of Autobytel common stock decreases or increases prior to the consummation of
the merger, the value of the Autobytel common stock to be received in the merger
in exchange for Autoweb common stock would correspondingly decrease or increase.

DIVIDENDS

     Neither Autobytel nor Autoweb has ever declared or paid cash dividends on
its capital stock. Pursuant to the acquisition agreement, each of Autobytel and
Autoweb has agreed not to pay cash dividends pending the consummation of the
merger without the prior written consent of the other. If the merger is not
consummated, the Autoweb board anticipates that it would continue its policy of
retaining any and all earnings to finance the expansion of its business.
Autobytel expects to retain any and all future earnings for use in the operation
and expansion of its business and does not anticipate paying any cash dividends
before or after the merger.

                                   THE MERGER

     This section of the joint proxy statement/prospectus describes the proposed
merger. While Autobytel and Autoweb believe that the description covers the
material terms of the merger and the related transactions, this summary may not
contain all of the information that is important to you. You should carefully
read this entire document and the other documents Autobytel and Autoweb refer to
for a more complete understanding of the merger and the related transactions.

BACKGROUND OF THE MERGER

     In light of the rapid changes in the automotive online commerce and
interactive services industries, it had become regular practice of the board of
directors of both Autobytel and Autoweb to review periodically with senior
management the relative position of each company in these industries, changes in
the competitive landscape and technology as well as strategic alternatives
available to each company in order to remain competitive and enhance stockholder
value. In connection with this ongoing review of long-term strategic plans, each
company has been considering a wide range of strategic options, including
internal growth strategies, growth through various strategic alliances,
investments, acquisitions or business combinations. In furtherance of these
objectives, from time to time each company has had contact with various parties
to explore on a preliminary basis several of these alternatives, including some
discussions with one or more parties during the time periods described below.

     During the course of the prior year, various senior management personnel of
Autobytel have been involved from time to time in discussions with members of
senior management of Autoweb regarding a variety of topics related to their
businesses, including a possible business combination.

     During a meeting in Menlo Park, California on June 30, 2000, between Mark
Lorimer, President and Chief Executive Officer of Autobytel, and Dean DeBiase,
Chairman of Autoweb, the parties raised the possibility that Autoweb and
Autobytel might explore a possible business combination.

     On July 28, 2000, Mr. Lorimer and Dennis Benner, Executive Vice President,
Corporate Development of Autobytel, met with Mr. DeBiase and Jeffrey Schwartz,
then the Vice President of Strategic Development of Autoweb, in Irvine,
California and discussed the possibility of a business combination.

     In September and early October of 2000, Mr. DeBiase spoke by phone several
times with Mr. Lorimer and discussed the general terms of a possible transaction
and outlined business integration issues that would have to be analyzed. During
these conversations, Mr. Lorimer indicated that Autobytel was interested in
continuing discussions regarding a strategic business combination with Autoweb.

     On October 8 and October 31, 2000, the Autoweb board of directors held
meetings to discuss potential sources of new capital for Autoweb and potential
strategic partners. During each meeting the board of directors also discussed a
range of economic and operational issues that would have to be resolved in any
transaction between Autoweb and Autobytel. The Autoweb board of directors
authorized Messrs. DeBiase and Schwartz and other members of Autoweb's senior
management to pursue further discussions with Autobytel.

     On November 2, 2000, Autobytel and Autoweb entered into a mutual
non-disclosure agreement.

     On November 6, 2000, Messrs. DeBiase and Schwartz, now Chief Executive
Officer and President of Autoweb, discussed the advantages and disadvantages of
various potential strategic transactions, including business combinations, with
certain Autoweb board members.

     On November 14, 2000, Messrs. DeBiase and Schwartz met with Mr. Lorimer to
discuss potential strategic transactions, including a business combination,
between Autoweb and Autobytel. During November and December 2000, Messrs.

AUTOBYTEL'S REASONS FOR THE MERGER

     At a meeting held on March 29, 2001, the board of directors of Autobytel
concluded that the merger was in the best interests of Autobytel and its
stockholders and determined to recommend that the Autobytel stockholders approve
the issuance of the shares of Autobytel common stock in the merger. In its
evaluation of the merger, the Autobytel board identified several potential
benefits of the merger, the most important of which included the board's
expectation that:

     - by combining its operations with Autoweb, Autobytel would be better
       positioned to broaden its customer base, accelerate its revenue growth
       and extend its position as a leading provider of automotive internet
       services;

     - by obtaining AIC's capabilities, the combined company would save data and
       licensing costs that Autobytel presently pays to third parties and would
       be better able to provide data content, technology and information
       services to automotive marketers on a global basis;

     - the merger would enable Autobytel to realize significant operating
       synergies, including reduced corporate overhead and the consolidation of
       sales and marketing organizations;

     - Autoweb's cash reserves would enable Autobytel to partially fund the
       anticipated ongoing operating losses incurred by Autoweb until cost
       reductions could be implemented; and

     - the combined companies would be able to employ the best practices and
       processes of each of Autobytel and Autoweb in future operations.

     Autobytel's board of directors consulted with senior management, as well as
its legal counsel and financial advisors, in reaching the decision to approve
the merger. In its evaluation of the merger, the Autobytel board reviewed
several factors, including:

     - information concerning the business, financial condition, operations,
       competitive position and prospects of Autobytel and Autoweb both
       individually and on a combined basis including the compatibility of the
       two companies' operations;

     - analyses and other information with respect to Autobytel and Autoweb
       including consideration of the strategic focus of the combined companies
       and the likelihood of their ability to compete successfully;

     - the possibility, as an alternative to the merger, of seeking to acquire a
       different company or establish other strategic alliances;

     - the cash position of the combined companies, especially during periods of
       volatility in the financial markets;

     - the opinion of Lehman Brothers to the Autobytel board of directors, to
       the effect that, based on and subject to matters set forth in its
       opinion, as of March 29, 2001, the consideration to be paid by Autobytel
       in the proposed transaction was fair, from a financial point of view, to
       Autobytel. The opinion of Lehman Brothers is described below under
       "Opinion of Autobytel's Financial Advisor";

     - the amount and form of the consideration to be received by Autoweb's
       stockholders in the merger in light of comparable transactions and the
       historical market prices, volatility and trading information for
       Autoweb's common stock and Autobytel's common stock;

     - that Autobytel's stockholders would hold approximately 66% of the
       outstanding common stock of the combined company after the merger;

     - the expectation that the merger would qualify as a tax-free
       reorganization;

     - the financial and other terms and conditions of the merger and the
       acquisition agreement;

     - the belief by Autobytel's senior management that the terms of the
       acquisition agreement are reasonable;

     - the potential impact of the merger on Autobytel's and Autoweb's customers
       and employees; and

     - discussions with Autobytel's management and legal and financial advisors
       as to the results of the due diligence investigation of Autoweb.

     The Autobytel board of directors also identified and considered a number of
potentially negative factors in its deliberations concerning the merger,
including the following:

     - the risk that the potential benefits of the merger may not be realized or
       may be delayed;

     - the costs associated with the merger, including merger related
       transaction costs, costs for disposing of real estate leases and costs
       for renegotiating or terminating marketing and equipment agreements;

     - the difficulty of integrating Autoweb with Autobytel and the management
       effort and costs required to complete the integration following the
       merger, including:

      - the difficulty of maintaining a consistent brand image given certain
        differences in the companies' respective business models;

      - potential difficulties in providing Autoweb customers with the requisite
        level of service in the post-merger transition; and,

      - given the importance of operating the combined companies on a common
        technology platform, possible difficulties associated with migrating
        Autoweb's operations to the Autobytel technology platform;

     - the possibility that the merger may not be consummated, even though it
       has been approved by Autobytel's and Autoweb's boards of directors;

     - the negative effect that treating the merger, for accounting purposes, as
       a "purchase," will have on the combined company's future earnings per
       share, due to amortization of "goodwill";

     - the risk that the premium offered relative to Autoweb's current stock
       price may not be viewed favorably by the market;

     - the impact of the accelerated vesting for certain Autoweb employees'
       stock options after a change in control of Autoweb and after such
       employees' termination; and

     - the other applicable risks described in this joint proxy
       statement/prospectus under "Risk Factors" beginning on page 8.

     The Autobytel board of directors concluded however, that, on balance, the
potential benefits to Autobytel and its stockholders in the merger outweighed
the risks associated with the merger. The discussion of the information and
factors considered by the Autobytel board of directors is not intended to be
exhaustive. In view of the variety of factors considered in connection with its
evaluation of the merger, the Autobytel board of directors did not find it
practicable to, and did not quantify or otherwise assign relative weight to, the
specific factors considered in reaching its determination.

AUTOWEB'S REASONS FOR THE MERGER

     On March 31, 2001, the board of directors of Autoweb unanimously (a)
determined that the proposed merger was consistent with and in furtherance of
the long-term business strategy of Autoweb and fair to, and in the best
interests of, Autoweb and its stockholders; and (b) approved the acquisition
agreement and the other transactions contemplated by the acquisition agreement,
contingent on the resolution of remaining due diligence matters and finalization
of agreements related to the acquisition. In reaching its decision to approve
the acquisition agreement and the merger and to recommend adoption of the
acquisition agreement by Autoweb stockholders, the Autoweb board of directors
consulted with its management team and advisors and independently considered the
proposed merger, acquisition agreement and the transactions contemplated by the
acquisition agreement. The board of directors of Autoweb has unanimously
recommended that the Autoweb shareholders vote FOR the approval and adoption of
the acquisition agreement and the proposed merger. The Autoweb board of
directors identified several potential benefits of the merger, including the
board of directors' expectation that:

     - Given the complementary nature of the technologies and business
       strategies of Autoweb and Autobytel, Autoweb's strategic objectives would
       be significantly furthered by the proposed merger, and as a result,
       Autoweb would be better positioned to reach these objectives than it
       would as a stand alone company. Autoweb's strategic objectives include
       expanding its customer base and expanding its content and service
       offerings. In this regard, the Autoweb board of directors believes that
       the merger will result in creation of the most comprehensive online
       automobile-related destination for customers, content and services.

     - The combined company will have a stronger financial position.

     - The merger will provide current and potential advertising companies,
       automobile manufacturers, dealers and other Autoweb customers with
       increased access to a larger, more targeted and desirable demographic
       group on the Internet.

     - The merger will result in a combined company that ranks among the largest
       online automobile related Web site networks worldwide, which will create
       greater brand recognition and may attract more customers.

     - The combined company will be able to take advantage of significant
       operating synergies, including reduced corporate overhead expenses and
       the consolidation of sales and marketing organizations.

     - The exchange ratio proposed by Autobytel represented, as of the signing
       of the acquisition agreement, consideration having a value, based upon
       the closing price of $1.49 per share of Autobytel common stock on April
       10, 2001 on Nasdaq National Market (the trading day preceding the date of
       the public announcement of the proposed merger), of $0.53 per share. This
       value represented a premium of approximately 83% over $0.29, the closing
       price per Autoweb common stock on April 10, 2001 on Nasdaq National
       Market.

     - Autoweb's stockholders will hold approximately 34% of the outstanding
       common stock of the combined company after the merger which will provide
       Autoweb's stockholders with the opportunity to share in the combined
       companies' long-term growth which the Autoweb board of directors believed
       would not be as achievable as a stand-alone company.

     - The opinion of Autoweb's financial advisor, Credit Suisse First Boston,
       dated March 31, 2001 as to the fairness, from a financial point of view
       to holders of Autoweb common stock and as of the date

of the opinion, of the exchange ratio provided for in the acquisition agreement,
as more fully described below under the caption "Opinion of Autoweb's Financial
Advisor".

     - The expectation that the merger will qualify as a tax-free
       reorganization.

     Autoweb's board of directors consulted with senior management, as well as
its legal counsel and financial advisors, in reaching a decision to approve the
merger. In its evaluation of the merger, the Autoweb board of directors reviewed
several other factors, including:

     - Information concerning the financial condition, business, operations,
       strategic objectives and prospects and competitive position of Autoweb
       and Autobytel before and after giving effect to the merger.

     - Current market conditions and industry trends affecting Autoweb,
       Autobytel and Internet business-to-business and business-to-consumer
       companies in general.

     - Current financial market conditions and historical market prices of
       Autoweb and Autobytel's common stock.

     - Volatility and trading information with respect to Autoweb common stock
       and Autobytel common stock.

     - Autoweb's capital requirements and its ability to attract additional
       capital or financing, if required.

     - A comparison of comparable merger transactions.

     - The impact of the merger on the advertisers, sponsors, customers and
       employees of Autoweb and Autobytel.

     - The terms and conditions of the acquisition agreement and related
       agreements.

     Autoweb's board of directors also identified and considered, among others,
a number of potentially negative factors in its deliberations concerning the
merger and the acquisition agreement, including the following:

     - The risk that the potential benefits of the merger may not be realized.

     - The potential challenges of integrating Autobytel's operations with those
       of Autoweb.

     - The effect of public announcement of the merger and the possibility the
       merger may not be consummated on the demand for Autoweb's products and
       services and relationships with customers and strategic partners,
       including the potential adverse consequences of employee retention
       associated with providing the notification of possible terminations
       required under the WARN Act.

     - The financial and other terms and conditions of the merger and the
       acquisition agreement including:

      - the non-solicitation and other protective provisions that may have the
        effect of discouraging other persons potentially interested in acquiring
        Autoweb from pursuing such an opportunity as more fully described under
        "The Acquisition Agreement -- No Solicitation by Autoweb".

      - the likelihood that the stockholders of Autoweb and Autobytel may not
        vote to approve and adopt the acquisition agreement and to approve the
        merger;

      - that, while the merger is likely to be completed, there are risks
        associated with certain conditions to the completion of the merger, and
        it is possible that the merger may not be completed even if approved by
        the stockholders of Autoweb and Autobytel; and

      - the costs to Autoweb due to fees payable in the event the acquisition
        agreement is terminated under certain circumstances.

     - Other applicable risks described in this joint proxy statement/prospectus
       under "Risk Factors" beginning on page 8.

     This discussion of the information and factors considered by Autoweb's
board is not intended to be exhaustive, but includes the material factors
considered. In view of the number and wide variety of factors considered in
connection with its evaluation of the merger, and the complexity of these
matters, the Autoweb board of directors did not find it practicable to, nor did
it attempt to, quantify, rank or otherwise assign relative weights to the
specific factors it considered. In addition, the Autoweb board of directors did
not undertake to make any specific determination as to whether any particular
factor was favorable or unfavorable to its ultimate determination or assign any
particular weight to any factor, but conducted an overall analysis of the
factors described above, including thorough discussions with and questioning of
Autoweb's management and management's analysis of the proposed merger based on
information received from Autoweb's legal, financial and accounting advisors. In
considering the factors described above, individual members of the board of
directors may have given different weight to different factors. Autoweb's board
of directors considered all these factors together and concluded that the risks
were outweighed by the potential benefits of the merger.

     For the reasons discussed above, Autoweb's board of directors has approved
the merger and the transactions contemplated by the acquisition agreement and
has determined that the merger and the transactions contemplated by the
acquisition agreement are advisable and fair to and in the best interests of
Autoweb and its stockholders, and recommends that Autoweb stockholders vote for
approval of the merger and the transactions contemplated by the acquisition
agreement.

OPINION OF AUTOBYTEL'S FINANCIAL ADVISOR

     Autobytel engaged Lehman Brothers to render its opinion with respect to the
fairness, from a financial point of view, to Autobytel of the consideration to
be paid by Autobytel in the proposed merger. On March 29, 2001, Lehman Brothers
rendered its opinion, that as of such date and, based on and subject to certain
matters stated therein, from a financial point of view, the consideration to be
paid by Autobytel in the proposed merger was fair to Autobytel. Based upon the
conversion ratio of Autobytel common stock for Autoweb's common stock of 0.3553,
the total consideration consisted of 34% of the stock of the combined company.

THE FULL TEXT OF LEHMAN BROTHERS' WRITTEN OPINION DATED MARCH 29, 2001 IS
ATTACHED AS ANNEX B TO THIS JOINT PROXY STATEMENT/PROSPECTUS (THE "LEHMAN
OPINION") AND IS INCORPORATED HEREIN BY REFERENCE. STOCKHOLDERS MAY READ THE
LEHMAN OPINION FOR A DISCUSSION OF ASSUMPTIONS MADE, MATTERS CONSIDERED AND
LIMITATIONS ON THE REVIEW UNDERTAKEN BY LEHMAN BROTHERS IN RENDERING ITS
OPINION. THE FOLLOWING IS A SUMMARY OF THE LEHMAN OPINION AND THE METHODOLOGY
THAT LEHMAN BROTHERS USED TO RENDER ITS FAIRNESS OPINION.

     The Lehman Opinion was provided for the information and assistance of the
Autobytel board of directors in connection with its consideration of the
proposed merger. The Lehman Opinion is not intended to be and does not
constitute a recommendation to any stockholder as to how such stockholder should
vote on the proposed merger. Lehman Brothers was not requested to opine as to,
and the Lehman Opinion does not in any matter address, (1) Autobytel's
underlying business decision to proceed with or effect the proposed merger, or
(2) any part of the proposed merger on a separate basis. The consideration to be
paid in the proposed merger was determined through arm's length negotiations
between Autobytel and Autoweb, and was approved by the Autobytel board of
directors. Lehman Brothers neither provided advice to the Autobytel board of
directors during such negotiations nor recommended any specific consideration to
the Autobytel board of directors or that any specific consideration would
constitute the only appropriate consideration for the proposed merger.

     In arriving at its opinion, Lehman Brothers reviewed and analyzed:

     - the draft acquisition agreement and the specific terms of the proposed
       merger;

     - publicly available information concerning Autobytel that Lehman Brothers
       believed to be relevant to its analysis, including Autobytel's Annual
       Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 1999,
       Autobytel's Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for the quarters ended March
       31,

       June 30, and September 30, 2000 and Autobytel's earnings release for the
       quarter and fiscal year ended December 31, 2000;

     - financial and operating information with respect to the business,
       operations and prospects of Autobytel furnished to Lehman Brothers by
       Autobytel;

     - publicly available information concerning Autoweb that Lehman Brothers
       believed to be relevant to its analysis, including Autoweb's Annual
       Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 1999,
       Autoweb's Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for the quarters ended March 31,
       June 30, and September 30, 2000 and Autoweb's earnings release for the
       quarter and fiscal year ended December 31, 2000;

     - financial and operating information with respect to the business,
       operations and prospects of Autoweb furnished to Lehman Brothers by
       Autoweb and Autobytel;

     - a comparison of the historical financial results and present financial
       condition of Autoweb and Autobytel with those of other companies that
       Lehman Brothers deemed relevant;

     - the potential pro forma financial effects of the combination of the
       businesses of Autobytel and Autoweb, including the cost savings,
       operating synergies and strategic benefits expected by the managements of
       Autobytel and Autoweb to result from the proposed merger;

     - a comparison of the relative financial contributions of Autobytel and
       Autoweb to the combined company following consummation of the proposed
       merger; and

     - a comparison of the financial terms of the proposed transaction with the
       financial terms of certain other recent transactions that Lehman Brothers
       deemed relevant.

     In addition, Lehman Brothers had discussions with the managements of
Autobytel and Autoweb concerning their respective businesses, operations,
assets, financial conditions and prospects and undertook such other studies,
analyses and investigations as Lehman Brothers deemed appropriate.

     In arriving at its opinion, Lehman Brothers assumed and relied upon the
accuracy and completeness of the financial and other information used by it
without assuming any responsibility for independent verification of such
information and further relied upon the assurances of managements of Autobytel
and Autoweb that they were not aware of any facts or circumstances that would
make such information inaccurate or misleading. With respect to the financial
projections of Autoweb furnished to Lehman Brothers by Autoweb and Autobytel,
respectively, upon advice of Autoweb and Autobytel, respectively, Lehman
Brothers assumed that such projections were reasonably prepared on a basis
reflecting the best currently available estimates and judgments of the
respective managements of Autoweb and Autobytel as to the future financial
performance of Autoweb and that Autoweb would perform substantially in
accordance with such projections. However, given that Autoweb's recent financial
performance had not met the projections of Autoweb's management in the past,
Lehman Brothers also prepared and considered more conservative financial
projections based upon the strong possibility that Autoweb would underperform
management's projections in the future. Lehman Brothers discussed these adjusted
projections with the management of Autobytel and they agreed with the
appropriateness of the use of such adjusted projections in performing Lehman
Brothers' analysis. With respect to the financial projections of Autobytel, upon
advice of Autobytel, Lehman Brothers assumed that such projections were
reasonably prepared on a basis reflecting the best currently available estimates
and judgments of the management of Autobytel, as to the future financial
performance of Autobytel and that Autobytel would perform substantially in
accordance with such projections. However, for purposes of its analysis, Lehman
Brothers considered certain somewhat more conservative assumptions and estimates
which resulted in certain adjustments to the projections of Autobytel. Lehman
Brothers discussed these adjusted projections with the management of Autobytel
and they agreed with the appropriateness of the use of such adjusted projections
in performing Lehman Brothers' analysis. With respect to cost savings, operating
synergies and strategic benefits expected by the managements of Autobytel and
Autoweb to result from the proposed transaction, Lehman Brothers assumed that
such cost savings, operating synergies and strategic benefits would be realized
substantially in

accordance with such expectations. In arriving at its opinion, Lehman Brothers
conducted only a limited physical inspection of the properties and facilities of
Autobytel and Autoweb and did not make or obtain any evaluations or appraisals
of the assets or liabilities of Autobytel or Autoweb. Lehman Brothers' opinion
necessarily was based upon market, economic and other conditions as they existed
on, and could be evaluated as of, the date of such opinion.

     In connection with the preparation and delivery of its opinion to
Autobytel's board of directors, Lehman Brothers performed a variety of financial
and comparative analyses, as described below. In arriving at its opinion, Lehman
Brothers did not ascribe a specific range of value to Autobytel or Autoweb, but
rather made its determination as to the fairness, from a financial point of
view, to Autobytel of the consideration to be paid by Autobytel in the proposed
merger on the basis of financial and comparative analyses. The preparation of a
fairness opinion involves various determinations as to the most appropriate and
relevant methods of financial and comparative analysis and the application of
those methods to the particular circumstances and, therefore, such an opinion is
not readily susceptible to summary description. Lehman Brothers believes that
its analyses must be considered as a whole and that considering any portion of
such analyses and factors, without considering all analyses and factors, could
create a misleading or incomplete view of the process underlying its opinion. In
its analyses, Lehman Brothers made numerous assumptions with respect to industry
performance, general business and economic conditions and other matters, many of
which are beyond the control of Autobytel and Autoweb. Any estimates contained
in these analyses are not necessarily indicative of actual values or predictive
of future results or values, which may be significantly more or less favorable
than as set forth therein. None of Autobytel, Autoweb, Lehman Brothers or any
other person assumes responsibility if future results are materially different
from those discussed. In addition, analyses relating to the value of businesses
do not purport to be appraisals or to reflect the prices at which businesses
actually may be sold.

     The following is a summary of the material financial analyses used by
Lehman Brothers in connection with providing its opinion to the Autobytel board
of directors. Certain of the summaries of financial analyses include information
presented in tabular format. In order to fully understand the financial analyses
used by Lehman Brothers, the tables must be read together with the text of each
summary. The tables alone do not constitute a complete description of the
financial analyses. Accordingly, the analyses listed in the tables and described
below must be considered as a whole. Considering any portion of such analyses
and of the factors considered, without considering all analyses and factors,
could create a misleading or incomplete view of the process underlying the
Lehman Opinion.

     In evaluating the fairness, from a financial point of view, of the
consideration to be paid by Autobytel in the proposed transaction, Lehman
Brothers evaluated Autoweb's contribution to the business, operating assets and
balance sheet of Autobytel using widely accepted methodologies, including
revenue contribution, comparable companies and comparable transaction analyses.
Lehman Brothers believed that these methodologies were particularly relevant,
given the fact that the consideration to be paid by Autobytel in the proposed
transaction represents the right of Autoweb's stockholders to receive 34% of
Autobytel's outstanding shares of common stock, as determined on the day of the
signing of the acquisition agreement and after giving effect to the shares
issued to Autoweb's stockholders. Based on all of these methodologies, the
exchange ratio range implied a pro forma ownership of Autobytel by Autoweb
stockholders of 34% to 46%. In performing these analyses, Lehman Brothers relied
on two cases of financial projections: a base case and a conservative case. The
base case (the "Base Case") was based on projections provided to Lehman Brothers
by Autobytel and Autoweb. The conservative case (the "Conservative Case") was
based on the adjusted projections prepared by Lehman Brothers after making
certain adjustments to managements' projections to reflect certain somewhat more
conservative assumptions and estimates.

     Contribution Analysis. Lehman Brothers analyzed the respective
contributions of Autobytel and Autoweb to the estimated calendar years 2001 and
2002 revenues of the combined company in the Base Case and Conservative Case as
described above. This analysis indicated the following relative contributions

of Autobytel and Autoweb and the pro forma equity ownership of holders of
Autobytel and Autoweb common stock in the combined company:

                                               2001E CONTRIBUTION                2002E CONTRIBUTION
                                         ------------------------------    ------------------------------
              KEY METRIC                 BASE CASE    CONSERVATIVE CASE    BASE CASE    CONSERVATIVE CASE
              ----------                 ---------    -----------------    ---------    -----------------

REVENUES
  Autobytel............................    58.7%            66.2%            57.1%            67.4%
  Autoweb..............................    41.3%            33.8%            42.9%            32.6%
PRO FORMA EQUITY OWNERSHIP
  Autobytel............................                             66%
  Autoweb..............................                             34%

     From the average revenue contribution for 2001 and 2002 in the Base and
Conservative Case projections, an implied equity value range of the combined
company was assumed according to Autobytel's market value as of March 26, 2001.
From this range, a corresponding range of Autoweb equity values was implied
using Autoweb's average revenue contribution range. Subsequently, Lehman
Brothers adjusted for the differences in the two companies' balance sheets,
operating items, marketing contracts and employee contracts and severance
agreements, as well as expected synergies for the combined company, to determine
a pro forma equity ownership range of 57.0% to 64.5% for Autobytel and 43.0% to
35.5% for Autoweb in the Base and Conservative Case, respectively. Lehman
Brothers noted that Autoweb's pro forma ownership of 34% was below both of the
implied ownership ranges.

     Comparable Companies Analysis. In order to assess how the public market
values shares of similar publicly traded companies, Lehman Brothers reviewed and
compared specific financial and operating data relating to Autoweb with selected
companies that Lehman Brothers deemed comparable to Autoweb, including
Amazon.com, Ashford.com, Barnesandnoble.com, Beyond.com, Buy.com, Drugstore.com,
Egghead.com, Etoys, Expedia, Peapod and Planetrx.com. Using publicly available
information, Lehman Brothers calculated and analyzed each company's enterprise
value to its historical and projected revenues. The enterprise value of each
company was obtained by adding short and long term debt, the market value of its
diluted common equity and the book value of any minority interest, and
subtracting cash and cash equivalents. As of March 26, 2001, the comparable
companies median enterprise multiple of actual calendar year 2000 and projected
2001 revenues were 0.16x and 0.10x, respectively.

     Using a range based upon the projected 2001 revenue multiple for similar
publicly traded companies between 0.00x and 0.15x, Lehman Brothers calculated
the implied range of Autoweb's equity ownership to be between 41% to 48% in the
Base Case and 41% to 46% in the Conservative Case. Lehman Brothers noted that
Autoweb's pro forma ownership of 34% was below both of the implied ownership
ranges.

     However, because of the inherent differences between the business,
operations and prospects of Autoweb and the business, operations and prospects
of the companies included in the comparable companies, Lehman Brothers believed
that it was inappropriate to, and therefore did not, rely solely on the
quantitative results of the comparable company analysis and accordingly also
made qualitative judgments concerning differences between the financial and
operating characteristics and prospects of Autoweb and the companies included in
the comparable company analysis that would affect the public trading values of
each.

     Comparable Transaction Analysis. Lehman Brothers reviewed publicly
available information with respect to various transactions involving comparable
public Internet business to consumer ("B-to-C") companies. In particular, Lehman
Brothers reviewed nine such transactions that have occurred since October 23,
1998 and determined the forward revenue multiples in these comparable
transactions. Due to the large discrepancy between market values at the time of
such transactions and the current market values of B-to-C companies, the forward
revenue valuation multiples of the selected transactions were adjusted by an
index of similar publicly traded companies used in the comparable company
analysis as of March 26, 2001. The median enterprise multiple of forward year
revenues in the comparable transactions was 0.13x. Using a range based upon the
forward 2001 revenue multiple for Autoweb of 0.05x to 0.20x,

Lehman Brothers calculated the implied range of Autoweb's equity ownership in
the combined company to be 43% to 47% in the conservative case and 43% to 50% in
the base case. Lehman Brothers noted that the comparable transaction analysis
supported its opinion, since the pro forma equity ownership of the Autoweb
shareholders in Autobytel will be 34% after consummation of the proposed
transaction.

     Lehman Brothers is an internationally recognized investment banking firm
and, as part of its investment banking activities, is regularly engaged in the
valuation of businesses and their securities in connection with mergers and
acquisitions, negotiated underwritings, competitive bids, secondary
distributions of listed and unlisted securities, private placements and
valuations for corporate and other purposes. Autobytel's board of directors
selected Lehman Brothers because of its expertise, reputation and familiarity
with Autobytel and because its investment banking professionals have experience
in transactions comparable to the merger.

     As compensation for its services in connection with the merger, Autobytel
has paid Lehman Brothers a customary fee. In addition, Autobytel has agreed to
indemnify Lehman Brothers for certain liabilities that may arise out of its
engagement by Autobytel and the rendering of the Lehman Opinion.

     In the ordinary course of its business, Lehman Brothers may actively trade
in equity securities of Autobytel and Autoweb for its own account and for the
accounts of its customers and, accordingly, may at any time hold a long or short
position in such securities.

OPINION OF AUTOWEB'S FINANCIAL ADVISOR

     Autoweb retained Credit Suisse First Boston to act as its exclusive
financial advisor in connection with the merger. In connection with Credit
Suisse First Boston's engagement, Autoweb requested that Credit Suisse First
Boston evaluate the fairness, from a financial point of view, of the exchange
ratio provided for in the merger to holders of Autoweb common stock. On March
31, 2001, the Autoweb board of directors met to review the proposed merger.
During this meeting, Credit Suisse First Boston reviewed with the board of
directors of Autoweb certain financial analyses, as described below. Also at
this meeting on March 31, 2001, Credit Suisse First Boston rendered to the
Autoweb board of directors its oral opinion, subsequently confirmed in writing,
that, as of March 31, 2001, based upon and subject to the various considerations
set forth in the Credit Suisse First Boston opinion, the exchange ratio in the
merger was fair, from a financial point of view, to holders of Autoweb common
stock.

     The full text of the Credit Suisse First Boston opinion, which sets forth,
among other things, assumptions made, procedures followed, matters considered
and limitations on the scope of the review undertaken by Credit Suisse First
Boston in rendering its opinion is attached as Annex C to this joint proxy
statement/prospectus and is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.
Autoweb stockholders are urged to, and should, read the Credit Suisse First
Boston opinion carefully in its entirety. The Credit Suisse First Boston opinion
addresses only the fairness, from a financial point of view and as of the date
of the Credit Suisse First Boston opinion, of the exchange ratio to holders of
Autoweb common stock, and does not constitute a recommendation to any
stockholder as to how such stockholder should vote or act on any matter relating
to the proposed merger. The summary of the Credit Suisse First Boston opinion in
this joint proxy statement/prospectus is qualified in its entirety by reference
to the full text of the Credit Suisse First Boston opinion.

     In connection with its opinion, Credit Suisse First Boston, among other
things,

     - reviewed a draft of the acquisition agreement dated March 29, 2001;

     - reviewed certain publicly available business and financial information
       relating to Autoweb and Autobytel;

     - reviewed certain other information relating to Autoweb and Autobytel,
       including financial forecasts, provided to it by or discussed with
       Autoweb and Autobytel, and met with the managements of Autoweb and
       Autobytel to discuss the businesses and prospects of Autoweb and
       Autobytel;

     - considered certain financial and stock market data of Autoweb and
       Autobytel and compared that data with similar data for other publicly
       held companies in businesses similar to those of Autoweb and Autobytel;

     - considered, to the extent publicly available, the financial terms of
       certain other business combinations and other transactions which have
       recently been effected or announced; and

     - considered such other information, financial studies, analyses and
       investigations and financial, economic and market criteria which Credit
       Suisse First Boston deemed relevant.

     Credit Suisse First Boston also relied upon the views of the managements of
Autoweb and Autobytel concerning the business, operational and strategic
benefits and implications of the merger, including financial forecasts provided
to Credit Suisse First Boston by Autoweb relating to synergies and operating
cost savings expected to be achieved through the combination of the operations
of Autoweb and Autobytel.

     In connection with its review, Credit Suisse First Boston did not assume
any responsibility for independent verification of any of the foregoing
information and relied on such information being complete and accurate in all
material respects. With respect to the financial forecasts for Autoweb and
Autobytel that it reviewed, Credit Suisse First Boston was advised, and assumed,
that such forecasts were reasonably prepared on bases reflecting the best
currently available estimates and judgments of the managements of Autoweb and
Autobytel as to the future financial performance of Autoweb and Autobytel,
respectively, and the best currently available estimates and judgments of the
management of Autoweb as to the cost savings and other potential synergies
(including the amount, timing and achievability thereof) anticipated to result
from the merger. In addition, Credit Suisse First Boston relied, without
independent verification, on the assessments of the management of Autoweb with
respect to (i) the future cash and other resource requirements of Autoweb and
Autobytel and (ii) the business and financial implications of Autoweb's failure
to engage in the merger or another similar transaction. Autoweb also informed
Credit Suisse First Boston, and Credit Suisse First Boston assumed, that the
merger will be treated as a tax-free reorganization for federal income tax
purposes. Credit Suisse First Boston was not requested to make, and did not
make, an independent evaluation or appraisal of the assets or liabilities
(contingent or otherwise) of Autoweb or Autobytel, nor was Credit Suisse First
Boston furnished with any such evaluations or appraisals. The Credit Suisse
First Boston opinion is necessarily based upon information available to it as of
the date of the opinion and upon financial, economic, market and other
conditions as they existed and could be evaluated on the date of the opinion.
Credit Suisse First Boston did not express any opinion as to what the value of
the Autobytel common stock actually will be when issued to the holders of
Autoweb common stock pursuant to the merger or the prices at which shares of
Autobytel common stock will trade at any time. Further, the Credit Suisse First
Boston opinion does not address the relative merits of the merger as compared to
other business combinations that might be available to Autoweb nor does it
address Autoweb's underlying business decision to effect the merger. Credit
Suisse First Boston relied as to certain legal matters on the advice of counsel
to Autoweb as provided to Autoweb. In addition, Credit Suisse First Boston
assumed that the merger will be consummated upon the terms set forth in the
draft acquisition agreement reviewed by Credit Suisse First Boston without
material alteration thereof.

     In preparing its opinion to the Autoweb board of directors, Credit Suisse
First Boston performed a variety of financial and comparative analyses. The
preparation of a fairness opinion is a complex process and is not necessarily
susceptible to partial analysis or summary description. Credit Suisse First
Boston believes that its analyses must be considered as a whole and that
selecting portions of its analyses and of the factors considered by it, without
considering all analyses and factors, could create a misleading view of the
processes underlying the Credit Suisse First Boston opinion. No company or
transaction used in the analysis performed by Credit Suisse First Boston as a
comparison is identical to Autoweb, Autobytel or the proposed merger. In
addition, Credit Suisse First Boston may have given various analyses more or
less weight than other analyses, and may have deemed various assumptions more or
less probable than other assumptions, so that the range of valuation resulting
from any particular analysis described below should not be taken to be Credit
Suisse First Boston's view of the actual value of Autoweb or Autobytel. In
performing its analyses, Credit Suisse First Boston made numerous assumptions
with respect to industry

performance, general business and economic conditions and other matters, many of
which are beyond the control of Autoweb or Autobytel. The analyses performed by
Credit Suisse First Boston are not necessarily indicative of actual values or
actual future results, which may be significantly more or less favorable than
suggested by such analyses. In addition, analyses relating to the value of
businesses or assets do not purport to be appraisals or to necessarily reflect
the prices at which businesses or assets may actually be sold. The analyses
performed were prepared solely as part of Credit Suisse First Boston's analysis
of the fairness, from a financial point of view, of the exchange ratio to
holders of Autoweb common stock and were provided to the board of directors of
Autoweb in connection with the delivery of the Credit Suisse First Boston
opinion.

     The following is a summary of the material financial analyses performed by
Credit Suisse First Boston in connection with the preparation of its opinion,
and reviewed with the Autoweb board of directors at a meeting of the Autoweb
board of directors held on March 31, 2001. Certain of the summaries of those
financial analyses include information presented in tabular format. In order to
understand fully the material financial analyses used by Credit Suisse First
Boston, the tables should be read together with the text of each summary. The
tables alone do not constitute a complete description of the material financial
analyses.

     Autoweb Cash Burn Analysis. Credit Suisse First Boston analyzed Autoweb's
cash resources and its estimated cash requirements for 2001 and 2002. Credit
Suisse First Boston noted that Autoweb had $22.4 million in cash at February 28,
2001 and that, on a normalized basis, Autoweb used $9.1 million in cash during
the fourth quarter of 2000, before working capital adjustments. Credit Suisse
First Boston noted that, based on this cash burn rate, Autoweb had 7.4 months of
cash on hand as of February 28, 2001. Credit Suisse First Boston also noted that
Autoweb's forecasts indicated that Autoweb would have a minimal amount of cash
before it would become profitable.

     Public Company Trading Valuation Analysis. Credit Suisse First Boston
compared certain financial information of Autoweb and Autobytel with that of
other companies involved in the Internet industry and the B2C industry,
including:

  Internet Companies:                        B2C Companies:

     - AOL Time Warner Inc.                     - Ebay Inc.
     - Yahoo Inc.                               - Amazon.com Inc.

                                                - Beyond.com Corp.

     Such information included, among other things, stock prices as multiples of
estimated earnings per share for calendar years 2001 and 2002, and the multiples
of aggregate value, defined as market capitalization plus total debt less cash
and cash equivalents, to estimated revenue for calendar years 2001 and 2002. The
multiples were calculated using publicly available information and consensus
forecasts by securities research analysts. The analysis was based upon the
closing stock prices for all of the companies as of March 29, 2001 and consensus
estimates of securities research analysts. With respect to Autoweb and
Autobytel, the analysis was based upon the latest available estimates of
securities research analysts,

which estimates for Autoweb were higher than the estimates provided to Credit
Suisse First Boston by Autoweb's management. The following table summarizes the
results of this analysis:

     Autoweb Liquidation Analysis. Credit Suisse First Boston analyzed Autoweb's
assets and liabilities and calculated, based on management estimates, that the
costs of liquidation would exceed Autoweb's assets by $0.6 million to $7.9

     Autobytel Cash Burn Analysis. Credit Suisse First Boston analyzed the cash
resources of Autobytel and its estimated cash requirements for 2001. Credit
Suisse First Boston noted that Autobytel had $77.5 million in cash at February
28, 2001 and that, on a normalized basis, Autobytel used $2.8 million in cash
during the fourth quarter of 2000, before working capital adjustments. Credit
Suisse First Boston noted that, based on this cash burn rate, Autobytel had 84.0
months of cash on hand as of February 28, 2001.

     Transaction Matrix. Credit Suisse First Boston calculated several values
implied by the exchange ratio of 0.3553x, including the implied price per
Autoweb share, the premium of such implied price to recent Autoweb trading
prices, the implied fully diluted equity value of Autoweb and the implied pro

forma fully diluted ownership of Autobytel by Autoweb stockholders. The
following table summarizes the results of this analysis:

     Historical Exchange Ratio Analysis. Credit Suisse First Boston compared the
average of the exchange ratios of the closing price of Autoweb common stock to
the closing price of Autobytel common stock for each trading day over various
periods ended March 29, 2001. The following table sets forth such average
exchange ratios for various periods ended March 29, 2001 and the

     Precedent Transaction Analysis. Credit Suisse First Boston reviewed 84
precedent transactions in the software/internet industry and calculated the
implied premiums paid in such transactions over the market price of the acquired
company prior to the announcement of such transactions. Credit Suisse First
Boston also calculated the price per Autoweb share implied by premiums at the
top of each range considered. The following table summarizes the results of this
analysis:

(1) Based on a premium of 100%.

     No transaction utilized as a comparison in the precedent transaction
analyses is identical to the merger. In evaluating the merger, Credit Suisse
First Boston made judgments and assumptions with regard to industry performance,
general business, economic, market and financial conditions and other matters,
many of which are beyond the control of Autobytel and Autoweb, such as the
impact of competition on the businesses of Autobytel and Autoweb and the
industry generally, industry growth and the absence of any adverse material
change in the financial condition and prospects of Autobytel and Autoweb or the
Internet industry or in the financial markets in general. Mathematical analysis,
such as determining the average or the median, is not in itself a meaningful
method of using comparable transaction data.

     Synergy Analysis. Credit Suisse First Boston considered the effects of
potential synergies on the estimated pro forma results of operations of the
combined company after the merger. This analysis was based solely upon the
estimates of the management of Autoweb of the synergies that the combined

company might be able to achieve following completion of the merger. The
management of Autobytel did not provide estimates of potential synergies to
Autoweb or Credit Suisse First Boston. The actual synergies achieved by the
combined company after the merger may vary from the potential synergies
estimated by Autoweb's management and the variations may be material. Based upon
the estimates of Autoweb's management, Credit Suisse First Boston noted that the
combined company could achieve revenue synergies of approximately $2.7 million
in 2001 and approximately $7.2 million in 2002 and cost synergies of
approximately $4.2 million in 2001 and approximately $12.0 million in 2002.

     Pro Forma Combined Cash Burn Analysis. Credit Suisse First Boston analyzed
the pro forma cash resources of the combined company and its estimated cash
requirements for 2001. Credit Suisse First Boston noted that the combined
company would have had approximately $99.9 million in cash at February 28, 2001
and that the combined company would have used $11.9 million in cash during the
fourth quarter of 2000. Credit Suisse First Boston noted that, based on this
cash burn rate, the combined company had 25.3 months of cash on hand as of
February 28, 2001. This cash burn rate was based upon historical cash burn rates
and did not reflect any potential synergies that might be achieved by the
combined company after the merger.

     Contribution Analysis. Credit Suisse First Boston analyzed the relative
contributions of Autoweb and Autobytel to the pro forma total revenues, total
cash, fully-diluted equity value and fully-diluted aggregate value of the
combined company. This analysis was based upon the latest available estimates of
securities research analysts for Autoweb and Autobytel, which estimates for
Autoweb were higher than the estimates provided to Credit Suisse First Boston by
Autoweb's management. The following table summarizes the results of this
analysis:

                                                  AUTOWEB      AUTOBYTEL
                                                 PERCENTAGE    PERCENTAGE
                                                 ----------    ----------

Estimated 2001 Revenues........................     37.3%         62.7%
Total Cash.....................................     22.4%         77.6%
Fully-diluted Equity Value.....................     16.3%         83.7%
Fully-diluted Aggregate Value..................       NM            NM

     As a result of both Autoweb and Autobytel having negative aggregate values,
Credit Suisse First Boston noted that the relative contributions of Autoweb and
Autobytel to the combined company's pro forma revenues did not imply
corresponding relative pro forma equity ownership.

     Pro Forma Cash Impact Analysis. Credit Suisse First Boston analyzed certain
pro forma effects expected to result from the merger, including the expected
impact of the merger on estimated cash per share of the combined company. This
analysis indicated that Autoweb's cash per share as of February 28, 2001, when
adjusted for the settlement of existing contracts, would increase by 151.8% in
this situation.

     Pro Forma Equity Value Analysis. Credit Suisse First Boston calculated the
price per Autoweb share and premium to the Autoweb share price implied by the
pro forma equity value of the combined company calculated as the sum of the
equity values of each of Autoweb and Autobytel as of March 29, 2001. The
following table summarizes the results of this analysis:

     Pro Forma Trading Analysis. Credit Suisse First Boston calculated the price
per Autoweb share implied by the exchange ratio in the merger of 0.3553x,
assuming that Autobytel common stock traded at

various 2002 price/earnings multiples and price/earnings growth rate multiples.
The following table summarizes the results of this analysis:

     Credit Suisse First Boston also calculated the future price per Autoweb
share implied by the exchange ratio in the merger of 0.3553x, assuming that
Autobytel common stock traded at various one-year forward price/earnings
multiples and price/earnings growth rate multiples. The following table
summarizes the results of this analysis:

                                                            AUTOBYTEL FUTURE VALUE BASED ON

Implied Autoweb Share Price (assuming no
  synergies)......................................  $ 0.75    $ 1.50    $ 2.24    $ 2.99    $ 4.49
Implied Autoweb Share Price (assuming
  synergies)......................................  $ 2.11    $ 4.22    $ 6.33    $ 8.44    $12.66

     Credit Suisse First Boston did not express any opinion as to what the value
of the Autobytel common stock actually will be when issued pursuant to the
merger or the prices at which shares of Autobytel common stock will trade at any
time.

     The actual results achieved by the combined company after the merger may
vary from such estimated results and the variations may be material.

     Credit Suisse First Boston's opinion was one of many factors taken into
consideration by the Autoweb board of directors in making its determination to
recommend the acquisition agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby.
Consequently, the analyses described above should not be viewed as determinative
of the opinion of the Autoweb board of directors or the management of Autoweb
with respect to the value of Autoweb or Autobytel or whether the Autoweb board
of directors would have been willing to agree to a different exchange ratio.

     The Autoweb board of directors retained Credit Suisse First Boston to act
as its exclusive financial advisor in connection with the merger. Credit Suisse
First Boston was selected by the Autoweb board of directors based on Credit
Suisse First Boston's qualifications, expertise and reputation. Credit Suisse
First Boston is an internationally recognized investment banking and advisory
firm. Credit Suisse First Boston, as part of its investment banking business, is
continuously engaged in the valuation of businesses and securities in connection
with mergers and acquisitions, leveraged buyouts, negotiated underwritings,
competitive biddings, secondary distributions of listed and unlisted securities,
private placements and valuations for corporate and other purposes. In the past,
Credit Suisse First Boston has provided financial and investment banking
services to Autoweb for which it received compensation. In the ordinary course
of its business, Credit Suisse First Boston and its affiliates may actively
trade the equity securities of both Autoweb and Autobytel for their own accounts
and for the accounts of customers and, accordingly, may at any time hold a long
or short position in such securities.

     Pursuant to an engagement letter dated August 23, 2000, Autoweb engaged
Credit Suisse First Boston to provide financial advisory services to the Autoweb
board of directors in connection with strategic alternatives, including the
merger, including, among other things, rendering its opinion and making the
presentation referred to above. Pursuant to the terms of the engagement letter,
Autoweb has agreed to pay Credit Suisse First Boston a customary fee in
connection therewith. Credit Suisse First Boston will also

receive a fee for rendering its opinion. In addition, Autoweb has agreed to
reimburse Credit Suisse First Boston for its out-of-pocket expenses, including
attorney's fees, incurred in connection with its engagement and to indemnify
Credit Suisse First Boston and certain related persons against certain
liabilities and expenses arising out of or in conjunction with its rendering of
services under its engagement, including liabilities arising under the federal
securities laws.

INTERESTS OF AUTOWEB DIRECTORS, OFFICERS, EMPLOYEES AND SIGNIFICANT STOCKHOLDERS
IN THE MERGER

     When considering the recommendation of Autoweb's board of directors that
stockholders approve the merger, you should be aware that some Autoweb
directors, employees and officers have interests in the merger that are
different from, or are in addition to, your interests. The Autoweb board of
directors was aware of these potential conflicts and considered them. These
include:

     - Severance Payments. Each of ten senior officers of Autoweb will receive
       severance payments equal to any unpaid base salary through the date of
       termination plus an amount equal to one year base salary plus an amount
       equal to a pro rated bonus based on the elapsed portion of the year up to
       a maximum of 35% of total annual base salary, in the event the officer is
       terminated without cause or terminates with good reason within one year
       following consummation of the merger. In addition, fifteen other senior
       employees of Autoweb will be eligible to receive severance payments equal
       to three, four or six months of the employee's base salary if they are
       terminated without cause following consummation of the merger.

     - Accelerated Vesting. Pursuant to the terms of letter agreements granting
       to ten senior officers of Autoweb change of control benefits, 75% of each
       officer's outstanding unvested options to purchase Autoweb common stock
       will vest on the consummation of the merger and the remainder will vest
       if within one year following the merger the officer is terminated without
       cause or terminates for good reason.

     - Employment. Two new directors, Jeffrey Schwartz and Mark R. Ross, will be
       appointed to the Autobytel board. In addition, some executive officers of
       Autoweb will become executive officers of Autobytel. Autobytel has agreed
       to enter into an employment agreement with Jeffrey Schwartz upon the
       consummation of the merger and may enter into additional employment
       contracts with other employees of Autoweb.

     - Indemnification. The directors and executive officers of Autoweb have
       customary rights to indemnification against certain liabilities. Further,
       Autobytel has agreed to use commercially reasonable efforts to provide
       for six years a policy of directors' and officers' liability insurance
       with respect to matters occurring on or before the effective time of the
       merger for the benefit of the directors and officers of Autoweb.

     As a result, these directors, officers, employees and stockholders could be
more likely to vote in favor of recommending the acquisition agreement and the
merger than if they did not hold these interests.

COMPLETION AND EFFECTIVENESS OF THE MERGER

     The merger will be completed when all of the conditions to completion of
the merger are satisfied or waived, including approval and adoption of the
acquisition agreement and the merger by the stockholders of Autoweb and approval
of the issuance of Autobytel common stock in the merger by stockholders of
Autobytel. We hope to complete the merger late in the second calendar quarter or
early in the third calendar quarter of 2001. The merger will become effective
upon the filing of the certificate of merger with the Secretary of State of
Delaware.

STRUCTURE OF THE MERGER AND CONVERSION OF AUTOWEB COMMON STOCK

     Pursuant to the acquisition agreement, Autobytel Acquisition I Corp., a
wholly-owned subsidiary of Autobytel, will merge with and into Autoweb.
Immediately following the merger, Autoweb will be a wholly-owned subsidiary of
Autobytel.

     Upon completion of the merger, each outstanding share of Autoweb common
stock will be converted into the right to receive 0.3553 shares of Autobytel
common stock. No fractional shares of Autobytel common stock will be issued
pursuant to the merger. In lieu thereof, each holder of shares of Autoweb common
stock who would otherwise be entitled to a fraction of a share of Autobytel
common stock shall receive an amount of cash (rounded to the nearest whole cent)
equal to the product of such fraction multiplied by the average closing price of
Autobytel common stock for the fifteen trading days immediately preceding the
last full trading day prior to the closing date of the merger, as reported on
the Nasdaq National Market. The number of shares of Autobytel common stock
awarded in the merger, after aggregating all fractional shares of Autobytel
common stock, shall be rounded down to the nearest whole share.

     Upon completion of the merger, Autobytel will assume options to purchase
shares of Autoweb common stock in connection with the merger. The number of
shares of Autobytel common stock purchasable under each post-merger option will
be equal to the number of shares of Autoweb common stock underlying the option,
multiplied by the merger exchange ratio of 0.3553 shares of Autobytel common
stock for each share of Autoweb common stock. The exercise price per share of
the Autobytel common stock issuable under each Autoweb option will equal the per
share exercise price of the Autoweb option divided by 0.3553.

EXCHANGE OF AUTOWEB STOCK CERTIFICATES FOR AUTOBYTEL STOCK CERTIFICATES

     When the merger is completed, Autobytel's exchange agent will mail to
Autoweb stockholders a letter of transmittal and instructions for use in
surrendering Autoweb stock certificates in exchange for Autobytel stock
certificates. When former Autoweb stockholders deliver their Autoweb stock
certificates to the exchange agent along with an executed letter of transmittal
and any other required documents, the Autoweb stock certificates will be
canceled and former Autoweb stockholders will receive Autobytel stock
certificates representing the number of full shares of Autobytel common stock to
which they are entitled under the acquisition agreement. They will receive
payment in cash, without interest, in lieu of any fractional shares of Autobytel
common stock which would have been otherwise issuable to them in the merger.

     Autoweb stockholders should not submit their Autoweb stock certificates for
exchange until they receive the transmittal instructions and a form of letter of
transmittal from the exchange agent.

NO DIVIDENDS

     Autoweb stockholders are not entitled to receive any dividends or other
distributions on Autobytel common stock until the merger is completed and they
have surrendered their Autoweb stock certificates in exchange for Autobytel
stock certificates.

     Subject to the effect of applicable laws, promptly following surrender of
Autoweb stock certificates and the issuance of the corresponding Autobytel
certificates, Autoweb stockholders will be paid the amount of dividends or other
distributions, without interest, with a record date after the completion of the
merger which were previously paid with respect to their whole shares of
Autobytel common stock.

     Autobytel will only issue Autoweb stockholders an Autobytel stock
certificate or a check in lieu of a fractional share in the name in which the
surrendered Autoweb stock certificate is registered. If Autoweb stockholders
wish to have their certificates issued in another name they must present the
exchange agent with all documents required to show and effect the unrecorded
transfer of ownership and show that they paid any applicable stock transfer
taxes.

MATERIAL UNITED STATES FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSIDERATIONS

     The discussion below constitutes the opinions of Paul, Hastings, Janofsky &
Walker LLP and Wilson Sonsini Goodrich & Rosati, P.C., regarding the material
federal income tax considerations generally applicable to United States holders
of Autoweb common stock who, pursuant to the merger, exchange

their Autoweb common stock solely for Autobytel common stock and cash in lieu of
fractional shares of Autobytel common stock. Consummation of the merger is
conditioned upon Autobytel's and Autoweb's receipt of opinions of their
respective counsel, confirming their opinions as described in this section
entitled "Material United States Federal Income Tax Considerations," to the
effect that the merger will qualify as a reorganization within the meaning of
Section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code.

     The opinions of Paul, Hastings, Janofsky & Walker LLP and Wilson Sonsini
Goodrich & Rosati, P.C., set forth in this section entitled "Material United
States Federal Income Tax Considerations" are subject to certain limitations,
qualifications and assumptions and are based on certain facts and
representations, including representations contained in certificates executed by
officers of Autobytel and Autoweb. The opinions have assumed the absence of
changes in relevant facts or in law between the date of this joint proxy
statement/prospectus and the closing date and assume that the merger is effected
as described in the acquisition agreement and in the joint proxy
statement/prospectus. The opinions are not binding on the Internal Revenue
Service or the courts and there can be no assurance that the Internal Revenue
Service or the courts will not take a contrary view. No ruling from the Internal
Revenue Service has been or will be sought. The discussion below is based upon
current provisions of the Internal Revenue Code, currently applicable U.S.
Treasury regulations promulgated thereunder, and judicial and administrative
decisions and rulings. Future legislative, judicial or administrative changes or
interpretations could alter or modify (including on a retroactive basis) the
discussion below.

     The discussion below does not purport to deal with all aspects of United
States federal income taxation that may affect particular stockholders in light
of their individual circumstances, and is not intended for stockholders subject
to special treatment under federal income tax law. Stockholders subject to
special treatment include, but are not limited to, insurance companies,
tax-exempt organizations, financial institutions, broker-dealers, foreign
persons, stockholders who are subject to the alternative minimum tax provisions
of the Internal Revenue Code, stockholders who hold their stock as part of a
hedge, appreciated financial position, straddle or conversion transaction,
stockholders who do not (or who will not at the time of the merger) hold their
stock as capital assets and stockholders who have acquired their stock upon the
exercise of employee options or otherwise as compensation. In addition, the
discussion below does not consider the effect of any applicable state, local or
foreign tax laws and further does not consider any tax consequences of
transactions effectuated by stockholders subsequent to, or concurrently with,
the merger. This discussion also does not describe tax consequences that are
generally assumed to be known by investors.

     In the opinion of Paul, Hastings, Janofsky & Walker LLP, counsel to
Autobytel, and in the opinion of Wilson Sonsini Goodrich & Rosati, P.C., counsel
to Autoweb, the merger will constitute a "reorganization" within the meaning of
Section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code.

     Assuming the merger constitutes a reorganization, subject to the
limitations and qualifications referred to herein, the following tax
consequences will result:

     - no gain or loss will be recognized by the holders of Autoweb common stock
       upon the receipt of Autobytel common stock solely in exchange for such
       Autoweb common stock in the merger, except as a result of cash received
       in lieu of fractional shares of Autobytel common stock;

     - cash payments received by holders of Autoweb common stock in lieu of a
       fractional share of Autobytel common stock will result in capital gain
       (or capital loss) measured by the difference between the cash payment
       received and the portion of the tax basis in the shares of Autoweb common
       stock surrendered that is allocable to such fractional share. Such
       capital gain (or capital loss) will be long-term capital gain (or capital
       loss) if the shares of Autoweb common stock allocable to such fractional
       share have been held for more than one year at the effective time of the
       merger;

     - the aggregate tax basis of the Autobytel common stock received by Autoweb
       stockholders in the merger will be the same as the aggregate tax basis of
       the Autoweb common stock surrendered in

       exchange, reduced by any tax basis allocable to a fractional share of
       Autobytel common stock for which cash is received;

     - the holding period with respect to Autobytel common stock received by
       each Autoweb stockholder in the merger will include the holding period
       for the Autoweb common stock surrendered in exchange; and

     - no gain or loss will be recognized by Autobytel, Autoweb or the
       transitory subsidiary that merges into Autoweb solely as a result of the
       merger.

THE ABOVE DISCUSSION IS INTENDED ONLY AS A SUMMARY OF THE MATERIAL UNITED STATES
FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSIDERATIONS RELATING TO THE MERGER AND DOES NOT PURPORT TO
BE A COMPLETE ANALYSIS OR DISCUSSION OF ALL POTENTIAL TAX EFFECTS RELEVANT
THERETO. AUTOWEB STOCKHOLDERS ARE URGED TO CONSULT THEIR OWN TAX ADVISORS AS TO
THE SPECIFIC TAX CONSEQUENCES TO THEM OF THE MERGER, INCLUDING TAX RETURN
REPORTING REQUIREMENTS AND THE EFFECT OF FEDERAL, STATE, LOCAL, AND FOREIGN TAX
LAWS.

ACCOUNTING TREATMENT FOR THE MERGER

     Autobytel intends to account for the merger as an acquisition under the
purchase method of accounting for business combinations.

REGULATORY FILINGS AND APPROVALS REQUIRED TO COMPLETE THE MERGER

     Although not expected by Autobytel and Autoweb, the merger may be subject
to review by the Department of Justice and the Federal Trade Commission to
determine whether it is in compliance with applicable antitrust laws. Should the
merger meet certain threshold requirements under the provisions of the
Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended, the merger may
not be consummated until the specified waiting period requirements of that Act
have been satisfied. If required, Autobytel and Autoweb intend to file all
required notification reports, together with requests for early termination for
the waiting period, with the Department of Justice and the Federal Trade
Commission under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as
amended. Certain Autoweb directors who will be directors of Autobytel after the
merger may also be required to file notification reports with the Federal Trade
Commission. In addition, the completion of this merger is subject to the
effectiveness of the registration statement of which this joint proxy
statement/prospectus is a part, and compliance with applicable corporate laws of
Delaware.

CERTAIN SECURITIES LAWS CONSIDERATIONS

     The Autobytel common stock to be issued in the merger will be registered
under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act"). These
shares will be freely transferable under the Securities Act, except for
Autobytel common stock issued to any person who is deemed to be an affiliate of
Autoweb or Autobytel. Persons who may be deemed to be affiliates include
individuals or entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common
control with Autoweb or Autobytel and include officers and directors, as well as
principal stockholders.

     Autoweb's affiliates may not sell their Autobytel common stock acquired in
the merger except pursuant to:

     - an effective registration statement under the Securities Act covering the
       resale of those shares;

     - an exemption under paragraph (d) of Rule 145 under the Securities Act; or

     - any other applicable exemption under the Securities Act.

     Autobytel's affiliates may not sell their Autobytel common stock acquired
in the merger except pursuant to:

     - Rule 144 under the Securities Act;

     - an effective registration statement under the Securities Act covering the
       resale of those shares; or

     - any other applicable exemption under the Securities Act.

DISSENTERS' RIGHTS

     No dissenters' or appraisal rights are available in connection with the
merger or any of the transactions contemplated by the acquisition agreement.
Delaware law does not provide for dissenters' or appraisal rights because
Autoweb's common stock is listed on the Nasdaq National Market and because the
shares of Autobytel common stock that Autoweb stockholders will receive in the
merger will also be listed on the Nasdaq National Market.

LISTING ON THE NASDAQ MARKET OF AUTOBYTEL COMMON STOCK TO BE ISSUED IN THE
MERGER

     Autobytel has agreed to cause the shares of Autobytel common stock to be
issued in the merger to be approved for listing on the Nasdaq National Market,
subject to official notice of issuance, prior to the effective time of the
merger.

DELISTING AND DEREGISTRATION OF AUTOWEB COMMON STOCK AFTER THE MERGER

     If the merger is completed, Autoweb's common stock will be delisted from
the Nasdaq National Market and will be deregistered under the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.

                           THE ACQUISITION AGREEMENT

     This section of the joint proxy statement/prospectus describes the
acquisition agreement. While Autobytel and Autoweb believe that the description
covers the material terms of the acquisition agreement, this summary may not
contain all of the information that is important to you. The composite conformed
acquisition agreement is attached to this joint proxy statement/prospectus as
Annex A and Autobytel and Autoweb urge you to read it carefully.

GENERAL

     Following the adoption of the acquisition agreement and approval of the
merger by Autoweb stockholders and the satisfaction or waiver of the other
conditions to the merger, Autobytel Acquisition I Corp., a wholly-owned
subsidiary of Autobytel, will merge into Autoweb. Autoweb will survive the
merger as a wholly owned subsidiary of Autobytel. If all conditions to the
merger are satisfied or waived, the merger will become effective at the time of
the filing by the surviving corporation of a duly executed certificate of merger
with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware.

THE EXCHANGE RATIO AND TREATMENT OF AUTOWEB COMMON STOCK

     At the effective time of the merger, each issued and outstanding share of
Autoweb common stock will be converted into the right to receive 0.3553 shares
of Autobytel common stock, except that any shares owned by Autoweb and any
shares owned by Autobytel or Autobytel Acquisition I Corp. will be cancelled
without conversion. Autobytel will adjust the exchange ratio to reflect any
reclassification, stock split, stock dividend, reorganization or other similar
change with respect to Autobytel common stock or Autoweb common stock occurring
before the effective time of the merger.

     Based on the exchange ratio of 0.3553 shares of Autobytel common stock for
each outstanding share of Autoweb common stock, and based on the number of
shares of Autoweb common stock outstanding as of March 31, 2001, a total of
10,490,748 shares of Autobytel common stock will be issued in the merger.

TREATMENT OF AUTOWEB STOCK OPTIONS AND WARRANTS

     At the effective time of the merger, Autobytel will assume each outstanding
option issued under Autoweb's 1997 Stock Option Plan, 1999 Equity Incentive
Plan, 1999 Employee Stock Purchase Plan, and 1999 Directors Stock Option Plan,
whether vested or unvested, to purchase shares of Autoweb common stock on
substantially the same terms and conditions as were applicable prior to the
effective time of the merger, except that (i) the options will be exercisable
for shares of Autobytel common stock, and (ii) the number of shares of Autobytel
common stock which may be purchased will be equal to the number of shares of
Autoweb common stock underlying the option multiplied by 0.3553. Any fractional
share of Autobytel common stock resulting from such adjustment will be rounded
down to the nearest whole number. The exercise price per share of Autobytel
common stock issuable under each Autoweb option will equal the per share
exercise price of the Autoweb common stock purchasable under the Autoweb option
divided by 0.3553. The exercise price will be rounded up to the nearest whole
cent.

     Autobytel will reserve for issuance a sufficient number of its common stock
for delivery upon Autoweb optionholders' exercise of options. If the shares of
Autobytel common stock underlying the assumed options have not already been
registered at the time the options are exercised, Autobytel will file a
registration statement on Form S-8 with respect to such shares within three
business days after the effective date of the merger.

     Within thirty days after the effective time, Autobytel will issue to each
person who, immediately prior to the effective time was a holder of an assumed
option, a document evidencing the foregoing assumption of such option by
Autobytel.

EXCHANGE OF CERTIFICATES

     After the effective time of the merger, Autobytel's exchange agent will
mail to each record holder of Autoweb common stock a letter of transmittal and
instructions for surrendering their certificates. Only those holders who
properly surrender their certificates in accordance with the instructions will
receive certificates representing Autobytel common stock, cash in lieu of any
fractional Autobytel common stock and any dividends or distributions to which
they are entitled. The surrendered certificates representing shares of Autoweb
common stock will be cancelled. After the effective time of the merger, each
certificate representing shares of Autoweb common stock that has not been
surrendered will only represent the right to receive common stock of Autobytel,
cash in lieu of any fractional Autobytel common stock and dividends or
distributions. Following the effective time of the merger, Autoweb will not
register any transfers of Autoweb common stock on its stock transfer books.

     Autobytel will not issue any fractional common stock in the merger.
Instead, each holder of shares of Autoweb common stock exchanged in the merger
who would otherwise be entitled to receive a fraction of a share of common stock
of Autobytel will receive cash, without interest, equal to the fractional share
multiplied by the average closing price of Autobytel common stock for the
fifteen trading days immediately preceding the last full trading day prior to
the closing date of the merger, as reported on the Nasdaq National Market.

     After the effective date of the merger, no dividends or other distributions
declared or made after the closing of the merger with respect to Autobytel
common stock will be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered Autoweb certificate
and no cash payment in lieu of fractional shares will be paid to any such holder
until the holder surrenders its Autoweb certificate in accordance with the
letter of transmittal. Upon surrender, Autobytel will pay to the record holder
of the certificate, without interest, the amount of cash payable in lieu of
fractional shares to which the holder is entitled and any dividends or
distributions with respect to the Autobytel common stock to which the holder is
entitled which have a record date after the effective date of the merger.

     If any Autoweb common stock certificate is lost, stolen or destroyed, an
Autoweb stockholder must provide an appropriate affidavit of that fact.
Autobytel may require an Autoweb stockholder to deliver a bond as indemnity
against any claim that may be made against Autobytel with respect to any lost,
stolen or destroyed certificate.

HOLDERS OF AUTOWEB COMMON STOCK SHOULD NOT SEND IN THEIR CERTIFICATES UNTIL THEY
RECEIVE A LETTER OF TRANSMITTAL FROM THE EXCHANGE AGENT.

NO SOLICITATION BY AUTOWEB

     Autoweb further agreed to cease, as of the date of the acquisition
agreement, any and all existing activities, discussions or negotiations with any
parties conducted prior to that date with respect to any "Takeover Proposal" as
defined below.

     Until the merger is completed or the acquisition agreement is terminated,
Autoweb agreed not to, and agreed to direct its officers, directors, employees,
representatives or other agents not to, take any of the following actions:

     - solicit, initiate or encourage the making, submission or announcement of
       any Takeover Proposal;

     - participate in any discussions or negotiations regarding any Takeover
       Proposal;

     - furnish to any person any information with respect to any Takeover
       Proposal;

     - any action that would make the representations and warranties in the
       acquisition agreement untrue or incorrect or prevent the performance of
       any covenant in the acquisition agreement;

     - knowingly take any other action to facilitate any inquiries or the making
       of any proposal that constitutes or may reasonably be expected to lead to
       any Takeover Proposal;

     - engage in discussions with any person with respect to any Takeover
       Proposal; or

     - subject to certain limited exceptions discussed below, approve, endorse
       or recommend any Takeover Proposal.

     Autoweb's board may, without breaching the acquisition agreement, respond
to an unsolicited, bona fide written Takeover Proposal by discussing the
proposal with, and furnishing information to the party making the proposal, if
all of the following conditions are met:

     - Autoweb's board reasonably concludes that the proposal constitutes a
       "Superior Proposal" as defined below;

     - Autoweb's board determines in good faith, after considering the advice of
       its outside legal counsel, that its fiduciary obligations require it to
       do so;

     - Autoweb gives notice to Autobytel of the determination of a Superior
       Proposal by its board of directors, and Autoweb receives a customary
       confidentiality agreement from that party; and

     - when furnishing nonpublic information to the party making the proposal,
       Autoweb contemporaneously furnishes the same information to Autobytel.

     A TAKEOVER PROPOSAL is any offer or proposal relating to any "Takeover
Transaction", as defined below, other than an offer, inquiry or proposal from
Autobytel.

     A TAKEOVER TRANSACTION is any transaction or series of transactions, other
than the merger, involving any of the following:

     - the acquisition or purchase of 20% or more of the assets of Autoweb; or

     - any merger, consolidation, business combination or similar transaction
       involving Autoweb.

     A SUPERIOR PROPOSAL is a Takeover Proposal if Autoweb's board of directors
has determined after considering the written opinion of its financial advisor
that such proposal is more favorable from a financial point of view to the
stockholders of Autoweb than the merger.

     Autoweb has agreed to promptly inform Autobytel of any request for
information that Autoweb reasonably believes would lead to a Takeover
Transaction, or of any Takeover Proposal, or any inquiry with respect to or
which Autoweb reasonably believes would lead to any Takeover Proposal, the
material terms and conditions of such request, Takeover Proposal or inquiry.
Autoweb further agreed to keep Autobytel informed in all material respects of
the status and details of any such request, Takeover Proposal or

inquiry, and to provide Autobytel with advance notice of any agreement to or
endorsement of any Takeover Proposal or its withdrawal of its recommendation of
the merger.

TERMINATION OF THE ACQUISITION AGREEMENT

     The acquisition agreement may be terminated at any time whether before or
after approval of the matters presented in connection with the merger by Autoweb
stockholders and Autobytel stockholders:

     - by mutual consent of Autobytel and Autoweb;

     - by either Autobytel or Autoweb, if any of the following shall have
       occurred:

      - if the merger is not completed before September 30, 2001 except that
        this right to terminate the acquisition agreement is not available to
        any party whose action or failure to act has been a cause of or resulted
        in the failure of the merger to occur on or before September 30, 2001 if
        such action or failure to act constitutes a breach of the acquisition
        agreement;

      - if any permanent injunction or other order of a court or other competent
        authority preventing the consummation of the merger shall have become
        final and non-appealable; or

      - if the acquisition agreement fails to receive the requisite vote for
        approval and adoption and the merger fails to receive the requisite vote
        for approval by the stockholders of Autoweb at an Autoweb stockholders
        meeting or at any adjournment of that meeting or by the stockholders of
        Autobytel at an Autobytel stockholders meeting or at any adjournment of
        that meeting, except that this right to terminate the acquisition
        agreement is not available to any party where the failure to obtain
        stockholder approval was caused by that party's action or failure to act
        and such action or failure to act constitutes a breach of the
        acquisition agreement.

     - by Autobytel if any of the following shall have occurred:

      - if for any reason Autoweb fails to call and hold the Autoweb
        stockholders meeting by September 30, 2001 unless the reason is that
        this registration statement has not been declared effective by the
        Securities and Exchange Commission at least thirty-five days before
        September 30, 2001 or unless Autoweb is terminating the acquisition
        agreement as a result of Autobytel's breach;

      - if the board of directors of Autoweb withdraws, modifies or changes its
        recommendation that the stockholders of Autoweb approve the merger in a
        manner adverse to Autobytel and its stockholders, unless such
        withdrawal, modification or change is as a result of a breach by
        Autobytel that would entitle Autoweb to terminate the acquisition
        agreement or as a result of a Material Adverse Effect on Autobytel;

      - upon a breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or obligation on
        the part of Autoweb set forth in the acquisition agreement if that
        breach is not cured within ten business days following receipt of
        written notice of the breach or in any event on or before September 30,
        2001 if Autobytel has not willfully breached any of its covenants under
        the acquisition agreement, which breach has not been cured; or

      - if a Takeover Proposal shall have occurred and the board of directors of
        Autoweb in connection therewith does not within ten business days of
        such occurrence (or, in any event, on or before September 30, 2001)
        reject such Takeover Proposal.

     - by Autoweb if any of the following shall have occurred:

      - if a "Change of Control," as defined below, of Autobytel shall have
        occurred;

      - upon a breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement on
        the part of Autobytel in the acquisition agreement if that breach is not
        cured within ten business days following receipt of written notice of
        the breach or in any event on or before September 30, 2001 if Autoweb
        has not willfully breached any of its covenants under the acquisition
        agreement, which breach has not been cured;

      - if for any reason Autobytel fails to call and hold the Autobytel
        stockholders meeting by September 30, 2001 unless the reason is that the
        registration statement has not been declared effective by the Securities
        and Exchange Commission at least thirty-five days before September 30,
        2001 or unless Autobytel is terminating the acquisition agreement as a
        result of Autoweb's breach;

      - if the board of directors of Autobytel withdraws, modifies or changes
        its recommendation of the issuance of Autobytel's common stock pursuant
        to the acquisition agreement in a manner adverse to Autoweb or its
        stockholders unless such withdrawal, modification or change is as a
        result of a breach by Autoweb that would entitle Autobytel to terminate
        the acquisition agreement or as a result of a Material Adverse Effect on
        Autoweb; or

      - if a Superior Proposal shall have been made and Autoweb shall have
        provided Autobytel at least five business days prior notice of the terms
        of the Superior Proposal, provided Autoweb simultaneously pays any
        termination fee due under the acquisition agreement.

     A CHANGE OF CONTROL is any merger or other business combination involving
Autobytel or the acquisition in one or more transactions of all or substantially
all of the assets of Autobytel after which Autobytel or its successor ceases to
be in the automotive, internet, technology or media business.

TERMINATION PAYMENTS BY AUTOWEB

     If any of the following occur and a Takeover Proposal exists or has been
proposed that has not been rejected, Autoweb shall promptly pay Autobytel in
immediately available funds an amount equal to the sum of (1) $1,000,000 plus
(2) Autobytel's costs and expenses directly incurred to negotiate, execute and
perform its obligation under the acquisition agreement, including costs and
expenses related to this joint proxy statement/prospectus and this registration
statement, and the merger (but specifically excluding any costs or expenses
related to the amendment of any agreement or settlement of any dispute prior to
the execution of the acquisition agreement) up to a maximum amount of
$1,000,000:

     - if the acquisition agreement is terminated by Autobytel due to Autoweb's
       breach of any of its representations, warranties, covenants or
       obligations and such breach has not been cured within ten business days
       of receipt by Autoweb of written notice of such breach or in any event on
       or before September 30, 2001 (and Autobytel has not willfully breached
       any of its covenants under the acquisition agreement, which breach is not
       cured);

     - if the closing condition that the representations and warranties of
       Autoweb in the acquisition agreement are true and correct as of the
       effective time of the merger (except as would not have a Material Adverse
       Effect on Autoweb and except for those representations and warranties
       that address matters as of a specified date), is not satisfied, and if on
       or after September 30, 2001, Autoweb terminates the acquisition
       agreement;

     - if the closing condition that Autoweb shall have performed and complied
       in all material respects with all covenants, obligations and conditions
       in the acquisition agreement required to be performed and complied with
       as of the effective time of the merger is not satisfied, and if on or
       after September 30, 2001, Autoweb terminates the acquisition agreement;

     - if the acquisition agreement is terminated by either party because the
       required approval of the stockholders of Autoweb has not been obtained
       due to the failure to obtain the required vote of the Autoweb
       stockholders at a duly held meeting or at any adjournment of the
       stockholder meeting; or

     - if the acquisition agreement is terminated by Autobytel due to Autoweb's
       failure to call and hold the Autoweb stockholders meeting by September
       30, 2001 unless the reason is that the registration statement has not
       been declared effective by the Securities and Exchange Commission at
       least thirty-five days prior to September 30, 2001 or unless Autoweb is
       terminating the acquisition agreement as a result of Autobytel's breach.

     Autoweb also must promptly pay Autobytel in immediately available funds an
amount equal to the sum of (1) $1,000,000 plus (2) Autobytel's costs and
expenses as described and limited above:

     - if the acquisition agreement is terminated by Autobytel if a Takeover
       Proposal has occurred and the board of directors of Autoweb in connection
       with it does not within ten business days of such occurrence (or, in any
       event, on or before September 30, 2001) reject such Takeover Proposal; or

     - if the acquisition agreement is terminated by Autoweb if a Superior
       Proposal has occurred and Autoweb has provided Autobytel at least five
       business days prior notice of the terms of the Superior Proposal.

     If the acquisition agreement is terminated by Autobytel due to Autoweb's
breach of any of its representations, warranties, covenants or obligations and
such breach has not been cured within ten business days of receipt by Autoweb of
written notice of such breach or in any event on or before September 30, 2001
(and Autobytel shall not have willfully breached any of its covenants under the
acquisition agreement, which breach is not cured) then Autoweb shall promptly
reimburse Autobytel's costs and expenses as described and limited above.

TERMINATION PAYMENTS BY AUTOBYTEL

     If the acquisition agreement is terminated by Autoweb due to any of the
following, then Autobytel shall promptly pay Autoweb in immediately available
funds an amount equal to Autoweb's costs and expenses directly incurred to
negotiate, execute and perform its obligations under the acquisition agreement,
including costs and expenses related to this joint proxy statement/prospectus
and this registration statement, and the merger (but specifically excluding any
costs or expenses related to the amendment of any agreement or settlement of any
dispute prior to the execution of the acquisition agreement), up to a maximum
amount of $1,000,000:

     - if Autobytel breaches any of its representations, warranties, covenants
       or other obligations and such breach has not been cured within ten
       business days following receipt by Autobytel of written notice of such
       breach or in any event on or before September 30, 2001 (and Autoweb has
       not willfully breached any of its covenants under the acquisition
       agreement, which breach is not cured);

     - if for any reason Autobytel fails to call and hold the Autobytel
       stockholders meeting by September 30, 2001 unless the reason is that the
       registration statement has not been declared effective by the Securities
       and Exchange Commission at least thirty-five days prior to September 30,
       2001 or unless Autobytel is terminating the acquisition agreement as a
       result of Autoweb's breach;

     - if the board of directors of Autobytel withdraws, modifies or changes its
       recommendation of the issuance of Autobytel's common stock in a manner
       adverse to Autoweb or its stockholders unless such withdrawal,
       modification or change is as a result of a breach by Autoweb that would
       entitle Autobytel to terminate the acquisition agreement or as a result
       of a Material Adverse Effect on Autoweb; or

     - if a Change of Control occurs.

OPERATIONS AFTER THE MERGER

     Following the merger, it is expected that Autoweb will continue its
operations as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Autobytel. The stockholders of
Autoweb will become stockholders of Autobytel, and their rights as stockholders
will be governed by the Autobytel certificate of incorporation and bylaws, as in
effect immediately prior to the consummation of the merger, and the laws of
Delaware. See "Comparison of Stockholder Rights and Corporate Governance
Matters" on page   of this joint proxy statement/ prospectus.

     THE INITIAL DIRECTORS AND OFFICERS OF AUTOWEB AFTER THE MERGER WILL BE THE
DIRECTORS AND OFFICERS OF AUTOBYTEL ACQUISITION I CORP.

EXTENSION, WAIVER AND AMENDMENT OF THE ACQUISITION AGREEMENT

     The board of directors of Autobytel and Autoweb may amend the acquisition
agreement at any time by mutual written consent provided that an amendment made
subsequent to adoption of the acquisition agreement by the stockholders of
Autoweb, Autobytel or Autobytel Acquisition I Corp. shall not:

     - alter or change the amount or kind of consideration to be received on
       conversion of the Autoweb common stock;

     - alter or change any term of the certificate of incorporation of the
       surviving corporation to be effected by the merger; or

     - alter or change any of the terms and conditions of the acquisition
       agreement if such alteration or change would materially adversely affect
       the holders of Autoweb common stock or Autobytel Acquisition I Corp.
       common stock.

     Either Autobytel or Autoweb may extend the other's time for the performance
of any of the obligations or other acts under the acquisition agreement, waive
any inaccuracies in the other's representations and warranties and waive
compliance by the other with any of the agreements or conditions contained in
the acquisition agreement if such extension or waiver is in writing.

                        AGREEMENTS RELATED TO THE MERGER

     This section of the joint proxy statement/prospectus describes the Autoweb
Voting Agreement and the Employment Agreement with Jeffrey A. Schwartz. While
Autobytel and Autoweb believe that these descriptions cover the material terms
of these agreements, the summary may not contain all of the information that is
important to you. Copies of forms of these agreements are available upon
request. Please see the section entitled "Where You Can Find More Information"
on page   .

AUTOWEB VOTING AGREEMENT

     One member of the Autoweb board of directors and three principal
stockholders of Autoweb common stock have entered into a voting agreement with
Autoweb and Autobytel. By entering into this voting agreement these Autoweb
stockholders have agreed to vote or cause to be voted all of their shares of
Autoweb common stock in favor of the approval of the acquisition agreement and
the merger.

     They have agreed not to transfer, sell, assign or otherwise dispose of
their shares of Autoweb common stock prior to the merger, the termination of the
acquisition agreement or September 30, 2001, whichever is earlier.

     These Autoweb stockholders may vote their shares of Autoweb common stock on
all other matters.

     As of March 31, 2001, the Autoweb stockholders who entered into the voting
agreement collectively owned 8,807,973 shares of Autoweb common stock, which
represent approximately 30% of the outstanding Autoweb common stock. None of the

EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENT WITH JEFFREY A. SCHWARTZ (SEE PAGES   )

                     DESCRIPTION OF AUTOBYTEL CAPITAL STOCK

GENERAL

     Autobytel's Fifth Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation
authorizes the issuance of up to 200,000,000 shares of common stock, par value
$0.001 per share, and 11,445,187 shares of preferred stock, par value $0.001 per
share, the rights and preferences of which may be established by the Autobytel
board of directors. As of March 31, 2001, 20,364,070 shares of common stock were
issued and outstanding and held by 142 stockholders of record and 0 shares of
preferred stock were issued and outstanding.

COMMON STOCK

     The holders of Autobytel common stock are entitled to one vote for each
share of capital stock held by such stockholder. Subject to preferences
applicable to any outstanding shares of preferred stock, the holders of common
stock are entitled to receive ratably dividends, if any, as may be declared by
the board of directors out of funds legally available for dividend payments. In
the event that Autobytel liquidates, dissolves or winds up, the holders of
common stock are entitled to share ratably in all assets remaining after payment
of liabilities and liquidation preferences of any outstanding shares of
preferred stock. Holders of common stock have no preemptive rights or rights to
convert their common stock into any other securities. There are no redemption or
sinking fund provisions applicable to the common stock. All outstanding shares
of common stock are fully paid and nonassessable.

PREFERRED STOCK

     The Autobytel board of directors is authorized to issue preferred stock
from time to time in one or more series, and to determine or alter the rights,
preferences, privileges and restrictions granted to or imposed upon any wholly
unissued series of preferred stock and to fix the number of shares of any series
of preferred stock and the designation of any such series of preferred stock.
These rights, designations and preferences include voting rights, dividend
rights, liquidation rights, redemption rights and conversion rights. No
preferred stock is issued or outstanding.

       COMPARISON OF STOCKHOLDER RIGHTS AND CORPORATE GOVERNANCE MATTERS

     The rights of Autobytel stockholders are currently governed by the Delaware
General Corporation Law (the "DGCL"), Autobytel's certificate of incorporation
and Autobytel's by-laws. The rights of Autoweb stockholders are currently
governed by the DGCL, Autoweb's certificate of incorporation and Autoweb's
by-laws. Upon completion of the merger, the rights of Autoweb stockholders who
become stockholders of Autobytel in the merger will be governed by the DGCL,
Autobytel's certificate of incorporation and Autobytel's by-laws.

     The following description summarizes the significant differences that may
affect the rights of stockholders of Autobytel and stockholders of Autoweb, but
is not a complete statement of all those differences, or a complete description
of the specific provisions referred to in this summary. The identification of
specific differences is not intended to indicate that other equally or more
significant differences do not exist. Stockholders should read carefully the
relevant provisions of the DGCL, Autobytel's certificate of incorporation,
Autobytel's by-laws, Autoweb's certificate of incorporation, and Autoweb's
by-laws.

CAPITALIZATION

     Autobytel. Autobytel's authorized capital stock is described under
"Description of Autobytel Capital Stock."

     Autoweb. The total authorized shares of capital stock of Autoweb consist of
60,000,000 shares of common stock, par value $0.001 per share, and 5,000,000
shares of preferred stock, par value $0.001 per share. At the close of business
on March 31, 2001, there were approximately 29,526,453 million shares of Autoweb
common stock outstanding and no shares of Autoweb preferred stock outstanding.

     The Autoweb board of directors is authorized to issue preferred stock from
time to time in any series, and to fix and alter the designations, preferences
and relative, participating, optional or other special rights of wholly unissued
series of preferred shares including voting rights, dividend rights, liquidation
rights, redemption rights and conversion rights.

VOTING RIGHTS

     The DGCL allows for more or less than one vote per share and permits
cumulative voting if each is provided for in the certificate of incorporation.

     Autobytel. Each holder of Autobytel common stock is entitled to one vote
for each share held of record and Autobytel's certificate of incorporation does
not permit cumulative voting for the election of directors.

     Autoweb. Each holder of Autoweb common stock is entitled to one vote for
each share held of record, and may not cumulate votes for the election of
directors.

NUMBER, ELECTION, VACANCY AND REMOVAL OF DIRECTORS

     The DGCL provides that the board of directors of a Delaware corporation
will consist of one or more directors as fixed by the corporation's certificate
of incorporation or by-laws. The DGCL also provides that a director or the
entire board of directors may be removed, with or without cause, by the holders
of a majority of the shares then entitled to vote at an election of directors.
However, in the case of a corporation whose board is classified, the directors
may be removed only for cause unless the certificate of incorporation provides
otherwise.

     Autobytel. Autobytel's certificate of incorporation provides that the
number of directors shall be set forth in the by-laws and may be changed from
time to time by an amendment to such by-laws. Autobytel's by-laws fix the number
of directors at eight. Autobytel's board of directors is divided into three
classes. After their initial terms, the directors in each class serve for a term
of three years each.

     Autobytel's by-laws provide that a decrease in the number of directors may
not shorten the term of an incumbent director. Under Autobytel's by-laws,
vacancies on the board of directors and newly created directorships resulting
from any increase in the authorized number of directors may be filled by vote of
the majority of the remaining directors, although less than a quorum, or by a
sole remaining director. Each director so chosen to fill a vacancy shall hold
office until his successor shall have been elected and shall qualify or until he
shall resign or shall have been removed. Whenever the holders of any class or
classes of stock or series thereof are entitled to elect one or more directors,
vacancies and newly created directorships of such class or classes or series may
be filled by a majority of the directors elected by such class or classes or
series thereof then in office, or by a sole remaining director so elected.

     Pursuant to the terms of the acquisition agreement, on or prior to the
closing date of the merger, Autobytel will take all actions necessary to elect
as directors two individuals designated by Autoweb.

     It is anticipated that, as allowed by Autobytel's by-laws, the Autobytel
board of directors will vote to expand its current number to 10 and then will
vote to appoint two individuals (see page   ).

     Autoweb. Autoweb's board of directors has six members. Autoweb's
certificate of incorporation provides that the number of directors may be
changed from time to time by vote of a majority of the entire board of directors
and that a decrease in the number of directors may not shorten the term of an
incumbent director. Autoweb's board of directors is divided into three classes.
After their initial terms, the directors in each class serve for a term of three
years each.

     Under Autoweb's certificate of incorporation, vacancies on the Autoweb
board of directors and newly created directorships resulting from any increase
in the authorized number of directors may be filled by the directors, acting by
majority of the directors then in office, although less than a quorum, and any
directors so chosen shall hold office until the next election of the class for
which such directors shall have been chosen and until their successors shall be
elected and qualified.

     Autoweb's certificate of incorporation provides that any director may be
removed at any time, but only for cause and only by the affirmative vote of the
holders of 75% or more of the outstanding shares of common stock of the
corporation entitled to vote generally in the election of directors cast at a
meeting of the stockholders called for that purpose, except that the foregoing
shall not apply whenever the holder of any one or more series of preferred stock
shall have the right, voting separately as a class, to elect one or more
directors of the corporation.

AMENDMENTS TO THE CERTIFICATE OF INCORPORATION

     Under the DGCL, amendments to a corporation's certificate of incorporation
require the approval of the board of directors and stockholders holding a
majority of the outstanding stock of each class entitled to vote on that
amendment as a class, unless a different proportion is specified in the
certificate of incorporation or by other provisions of the DGCL.

AMENDMENTS TO THE BY-LAWS

     Under the DGCL, by-laws of a corporation may be amended or repealed by
stockholders, and, if provided for in the corporation's certificate of
incorporation, by the directors.

     Autobytel. Autobytel's certificate of incorporation authorizes the board of
directors to amend or repeal the by-laws. Autobytel's by-laws may be amended or
repealed by the directors, by vote of a majority of the number of directors then
in office, acting at any meeting of the board, or by the stockholders, by the
vote of a majority of the outstanding shares of voting stock of the corporation,
at an annual meeting of the stockholders, without previous notice, or at any
special meeting of stockholders, provided that notice of such amendment or
repeal is given in the notice of the special meeting.

     Autoweb. Autoweb's by-laws provide that its stockholders holding a majority
of the corporation's outstanding voting stock have the power to adopt, amend, or
repeal its by-laws. Autoweb's certificate of

incorporation gives Autoweb's board of directors the power to adopt, amend or
repeal Autoweb's by-laws except insofar as the by-laws adopted by the
stockholders provide otherwise.

STOCKHOLDER ACTION

     The DGCL authorizes stockholder action without a meeting unless otherwise
provided in a corporation's certificate of incorporation.

     For both Autobytel and Autoweb the certificate of incorporation provides
that the stockholders may not take action by written consent without a meeting,
but must take action at a duly called annual or special meeting of stockholders.

SPECIAL STOCKHOLDER MEETINGS

     Under the DGCL, a special meeting of stockholders may be called by the
board of directors or by any other person authorized to do so in the certificate
of incorporation or the by-laws. The DGCL requires notice of stockholders'
meetings to be sent to all stockholders of record entitled to vote thereon not
less than ten nor more than sixty days before the date of the meeting.

     Autobytel. Autobytel's by-laws provide that special meetings of
stockholders may be called at any time by the board of directors, by a committee
of the board of directors whose powers and authority include the power to call
such meetings, by the Chairman of the Board, or by the President.

     Autoweb. Autoweb's by-laws provide special meetings of stockholders may be
called at any time by the Chairman of the Board, the Chief Executive Officer,
the President, or by a majority of the members of the board of directors.

     The by-laws of each company provide that notice of each meeting of the
stockholders, whether annual or special, shall be given not fewer than ten nor
more than sixty days in advance of the date of that meeting.

LIMITATION OF PERSONAL LIABILITY OF DIRECTORS AND INDEMNIFICATION

     The DGCL provides that a corporation's certificate of incorporation may
include a provision limiting the personal liability of a director to the
corporation or its stockholders for monetary damages for breach of fiduciary
duty as a director. The DGCL permits a corporation to indemnify any director,
officer, employee or agent of the corporation for expenses, monetary damages,
fines and settlement amounts to the extent the person acted in good faith and in
a manner he or she believed to be in the best interests of the corporation and,
with respect to any criminal action, had no reasonable cause to believe the
conduct was unlawful.

     The DGCL does not permit indemnification if the person is held liable to
the corporation except to the extent that an appropriate court concludes, upon
application by the person, that despite the adjudication of liability but in
view of all the circumstances, the person is fairly and reasonably entitled to
indemnification for those expenses that the court deems proper. No provision can
eliminate or limit the liability of a director for:

     - any breach of the director's duty of loyalty to the corporation or its
       stockholders;

     - acts or omissions not in good faith or which involve intentional
       misconduct or a knowing violation of the law;

     - violation of Section 174 of the DGCL regarding unlawful payment of
       dividends or unlawful stock purchases or redemptions;

     - any transaction from which the director derived an improper personal
       benefit; or

     - any act or omission before the adoption of a provision eliminating or
       limiting the liability of a director for breach of fiduciary duty in the
       certificate of incorporation.

     Autobytel's and Autoweb's certificate of incorporation and by-laws limit or
eliminate the liability of directors to the fullest extent permitted by the DGCL
and require indemnification to the maximum extent permitted by the DGCL.

DIVIDENDS

     As Delaware corporations, Autobytel and Autoweb may declare and pay
dividends out of their surplus or, if they have no surplus, out of any net
profits for the fiscal year in which the dividend was declared or for the
preceding fiscal year in which the dividend was declared, provided that the
payment will not reduce capital below the amount of capital represented by all
classes of shares having a preference upon the distribution of assets.

PROVISIONS RELATING TO ACQUISITIONS AND BUSINESS COMBINATIONS

     Section 203 of the DGCL prohibits a Delaware corporation from engaging in
any "business combination" with any person who owns 15% or more of a
corporation's voting stock, such as an interested stockholder, for a period of
three years following the time that person became an interested stockholder,
unless:

     - the corporation's board of directors has approved, before the time on
       which that person became an interested stockholder, either the business
       combination or the transaction that resulted in the person becoming an
       interested stockholder;

     - upon consummation of the transaction that resulted in that person
       becoming an interested stockholder, that person owned at least 85% of the
       corporation's voting stock outstanding at that time, excluding shares
       owned by persons who are both directors and officers and shares owned by
       employee stock plans in which participants do not have the right to
       determine confidentially whether shares will be tendered in a tender or
       exchange offer; or

     - at or after the time on which that person became an interested
       stockholder, the business combination is approved by the board of
       directors and authorized by the affirmative vote, at an annual or special
       meeting and not by written consent, of at least 66 2/3% of the
       outstanding voting stock not owned by the interested stockholder.

     For purposes of determining whether a person is the "owner" of 15% or more
of a corporation's voting stock for purposes of Section 203 of the DGCL,
ownership is defined broadly to include the right, directly or indirectly, to
acquire the stock or to control the voting or disposition of the stock.

     A "business combination" is also defined broadly to include:

     - mergers and sales or other dispositions of 10% or more of the assets of a
       corporation with or to an interested stockholder;

     - specific transactions resulting in the issuance or transfer to the
       interested stockholder of any stock of the corporation or its
       subsidiaries;

     - specific transactions that would result in an increase in the
       proportionate share of a corporation's or its subsidiaries' stock owned
       by the interested stockholder; and

     - any receipt by the interested stockholder of the benefit, directly or
       indirectly, except proportionately as a stockholder, of any loans,
       advances, guarantees, pledges or other financial benefits provided by or
       through the corporation or any of its subsidiaries.

     A Delaware corporation may elect not to be governed by Section 203 by a
provision contained in its original certificate of incorporation, its by-laws,
or an amendment to the original certificate of incorporation, which amendment
must be approved by a majority of the shares entitled to vote and may not be
further amended by the board of directors. This type of amendment is effective
immediately in the case of a corporation that has not elected in its original
certificate of incorporation or amendment thereto to be governed by Section 203
and has never had voting stock listed on a national securities exchange,

authorized for quotation on the Nasdaq Stock Market or held of record by more
than 2,000 stockholders. Otherwise this amendment is not effective until 12
months following its adoption.

     Neither Autobytel nor Autoweb has made an election not to be governed by
Section 203 and both are therefore subject to Section 203 of the DGCL.

MERGERS, ACQUISITIONS AND OTHER TRANSACTIONS

     Under the DGCL, a merger, consolidation or sale of all or substantially all
of a corporation's assets must be approved by the board of directors and by a
majority of the outstanding stock of the corporation entitled to vote on the
matter, except that no vote of stockholders of a constituent corporation
surviving a merger is required unless the corporation provides otherwise in its
certificate of incorporation if:

     - the acquisition agreement does not amend the certificate of incorporation
       of the surviving corporation;

     - each share of stock of the surviving corporation outstanding before the
       merger is an identical outstanding or treasury share after the merger;
       and

     - either no shares of common stock of the surviving corporation are to be
       issued or delivered by way of the merger or, if common stock will be
       issued or delivered, it will not increase the number of shares of common
       stock outstanding immediately before the merger by more than 20%.

     Autobytel. Autobytel is not required by the DGCL to submit the proposed
merger to its stockholders for approval; however, approval is being sought from
Autobytel's stockholders to satisfy the listing requirements of the Nasdaq
because more than 20% of Autobytel's stock is being issued in the merger.

     Autoweb. Autoweb is required by the DGCL to submit the proposed merger to
its stockholders for approval.

DISSENTERS' APPRAISAL RIGHTS

     Under the DGCL, dissenters' rights of appraisal are available to a
stockholder of a corporation only in connection with some mergers or
consolidations involving that corporation. Appraisal rights are not available
under the DGCL if the corporation's stock is either:

     - listed on a national securities exchange or designated as a national
       market system security on an interdealer quotation system by the National
       Association of Securities Dealers, Inc., as the Autobytel and Autoweb
       common shares are, or

     - held of record by more than 2,000 stockholders;

except that appraisal rights will be available if the merger or consolidation
requires stockholders to exchange their stock for anything other than:

     - shares of the surviving corporation,

     - shares of another corporation that will be listed on a national
       securities exchange, designated as a national market system security on
       an interdealer quotation system by the National Association of Securities
       Dealers, Inc. or held of record by more than 2,000 stockholders, or

     - cash in place of fractional shares.

     Additionally, no appraisal rights are available if the corporation is the
surviving corporation, and no vote of its stockholders is required for the
merger.

     Appraisal rights are not available to Autobytel or Autoweb stockholders in
connection with the proposed merger.

PREEMPTIVE RIGHTS

     Under the DGCL, stockholders do not have a statutory preemptive right to
acquire proportional amounts of a corporation's unissued shares upon a decision
by the board of directors to issue them.

     Neither Autobytel's nor Autoweb's certificate of incorporation provides for
its stockholders to have any preemptive rights with respect to any shares of its
capital stock.

                          THE AUTOBYTEL ANNUAL MEETING

DATE, TIME AND PLACE OF AUTOBYTEL ANNUAL MEETING

     The date, time and place of the annual meeting of Autobytel stockholders
are as follows:

                                            , 2001
                                  a.m. Pacific time

PURPOSE OF THE ANNUAL MEETING

     Autobytel is furnishing this joint proxy statement/prospectus to its
stockholders in connection with the solicitation of proxies by Autobytel's board
of directors. This joint proxy statement/prospectus is being mailed on or about
               , 2001. The Autobytel board of directors will use the proxies at
the annual meeting of stockholders of Autobytel to be held on                ,
2001 and at any adjournment or postponement thereof.

     The annual meeting is being held so that Autobytel stockholders may
consider and vote upon the following proposals:

     (1) To approve the issuance of shares of Autobytel common stock in the
         proposed merger of a wholly owned subsidiary of Autobytel with and into
         Autoweb as contemplated by the acquisition agreement dated as of April
         11, 2001, among Autobytel, Autobytel Acquisition I Corp. and Autoweb.
         Autobytel will issue 0.3553 shares of common stock in exchange for each
         share of outstanding common stock of Autoweb.

     (2) To elect three Class III Directors.

     (3) To ratify and approve Autobytel's independent public accountants for
         fiscal 2001.

     (4) To approve an amendment to Autobytel's Certificate of Incorporation
         changing the name of Autobytel to Autobytel Inc.

     (5) To transact any other business that properly comes before the annual
         meeting or any adjournments or postponements thereof.

RECORD DATE AND OUTSTANDING SHARES

     Autobytel's board of directors has fixed the close of business on
               , 2001 as the record date for the annual meeting. Only holders of
record of Autobytel's common stock at the close of business on the record date
are entitled to notice of and to vote at the meeting. As of the close of
business on the record date, there were        shares of common stock
outstanding and entitled to vote, held of record by approximately
       stockholders, although Autobytel has been informed that there are in
excess of        beneficial owners of common stock.

QUORUM AND VOTE REQUIRED

     Holders of Autobytel common stock are entitled to one vote for each share
held as of the record date. Approval of Proposals 1 and 3 requires the
affirmative vote of a majority of the outstanding common stock of Autobytel
present in person or represented by proxy at the meeting. Approval of the
directors in Proposal 2 requires the vote of a plurality of the outstanding
common stock of Autobytel present in person or represented by proxy at the
meeting. Approval of Proposal 4 requires the affirmative vote of a majority of
the outstanding common stock of Autobytel. Attendance at the meeting in person
or by proxy of the shares representing a majority of the outstanding common
stock of Autobytel is required for a quorum.

     On the record date, directors and executive officers of Autobytel as a
group beneficially owned approximately        million shares of common stock.

ABSTENTIONS

     Any abstention will be counted for purposes of determining a quorum, but
will have the same effect as a vote AGAINST the proposals considered at the
annual meeting.

BROKER NON-VOTES

     In the event that a broker, bank, custodian, nominee or other record holder
of Autobytel's common stock indicates on a proxy that it does not have
discretionary authority to vote certain shares on a particular matter, which is
called a broker non-vote, those shares will not be considered for purposes of
determining the number of shares entitled to vote with respect to a particular
proposal on which the broker has expressly not voted, but will be counted for
purposes of determining the presence or absence of a quorum for the transaction
of business. Failing to instruct a broker on Proposal 4 has the same effect as
voting against Proposal 4.

DISSENTERS' RIGHTS

     Under Delaware law, Autobytel stockholders are not entitled to dissent from
the merger.

SOLICITATION OF PROXY; EXPENSES OF PROXY SOLICITATION

     The enclosed proxy is solicited by and on behalf of the board of directors
of Autobytel. In addition to solicitation by mail, officers, directors and
regular employees of Autobytel, who will receive no additional compensation for
their services, may solicit proxies by mail, telegraph, facsimile transmission
or personal calls. These persons will receive no additional compensation for
solicitation of proxies, but may be reimbursed for reasonable out-of-pocket
expenses.

     Autobytel will pay all of the expenses of soliciting proxies to be voted at
the meeting, except that Autoweb will share equally the expenses incurred in
connection with filing and printing this joint proxy statement/prospectus.
Autobytel has requested brokers and nominees who hold stock in their name to
furnish this proxy material to their customers and Autobytel will reimburse such
brokers and nominees for their related out-of-pocket expenses.

     Autobytel has also engaged [               ] to solicit proxies on its
behalf. It is expected that [               ]'s fees will be approximately
$[               ] plus the reimbursement of expenses.

VOTING OF PROXIES

     The proxy accompanying this joint proxy statement/prospectus is solicited
on behalf of the Autobytel board of directors for use at the meeting. Please
complete, date and sign the accompanying proxy and promptly return it in the
enclosed envelope or otherwise mail it to Autobytel. All properly signed proxies
that Autobytel receives prior to the vote at the meeting and that are not
revoked will be voted at the meeting according to the instructions indicated on
the proxies or, if no direction is indicated, such proxies will be voted FOR
each of the aforementioned proposals to be considered at the annual meeting.

     Autobytel's board of directors does not know of any matter that is not
referred to in this joint proxy statement/prospectus to be presented for action
at the meeting. If any other matters are properly brought before the meeting,
the persons named in the proxies will have discretion to vote on such matters in
accordance with their best judgment.

REVOCABILITY OF PROXY

     If you are the holder of record for your shares, you may revoke your proxy
at any time before it is exercised at the annual meeting by taking any of the
following actions:

     - delivering a written notice to the secretary of Autobytel at its
       principal office, 18872 MacArthur Boulevard, Irvine, California
       92612-1400;

     - delivering a signed subsequent proxy relating to the same shares and
       bearing a later date prior to the vote at the meeting; or

     - attending the annual meeting and voting in person, although attendance at
       the meeting will not, by itself, revoke a proxy.

     Please note, however, that if your shares are held of record by a broker,
bank or other nominee and you wish to vote at the meeting, you must bring to the
meeting a letter from the broker, bank or other nominee confirming your
beneficial ownership of the shares.

RECOMMENDATION OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS

     The board of directors of Autobytel has unanimously determined that the
terms of the merger and the acquisition agreement, are in the best interests of
Autobytel and the Autobytel stockholders. Accordingly, the Autobytel board of
directors recommends that Autobytel stockholders vote FOR the proposal to
approve the issuance of shares of Autobytel common stock thereto, FOR the
proposal to elect three Class III Directors, FOR the ratification of Autobytel's
independent public accountants for fiscal 2001 and FOR the proposal to amend
Autobytel's Certificate of Incorporation.

TO ASSURE THAT YOUR SHARES ARE REPRESENTED AT THE MEETING, PLEASE COMPLETE, DATE
AND SIGN THE ENCLOSED PROXY AND MAIL IT PROMPTLY IN THE POSTAGE-PAID ENVELOPE
PROVIDED, WHETHER OR NOT YOU PLAN TO ATTEND THE MEETING. YOU MAY REVOKE YOUR
PROXY AT ANY TIME BEFORE IT IS VOTED.

              RATIFICATION AND APPROVAL OF ACQUISITION AGREEMENT,
                         MERGER AND ISSUANCE OF SHARES

     The merger will be consummated on the terms and subject to the conditions
set forth in the acquisition agreement. As a result of the merger, a wholly
owned subsidiary of Autobytel will be merged with and into Autoweb, with Autoweb
as the surviving corporation. Autobytel will issue 0.3553 shares of common stock
in exchange for each share of outstanding common stock of Autoweb.

     You are encouraged to read the sections of this joint proxy
statement/prospectus entitled "Merger" on page   and "Acquisition Agreement" on

     THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS OF AUTOBYTEL RECOMMENDS THAT THE STOCKHOLDERS VOTE

                              AUTOBYTEL PROPOSAL 2

            NOMINATION AND ELECTION OF AUTOBYTEL CLASS III DIRECTORS

     The persons named in the enclosed proxy will vote to elect the three
nominees named below under "Nominees for Class III Director" unless instructed
otherwise in the proxy. The persons receiving the greatest number of votes, up
to the number of directors to be elected, shall be the persons elected as the
Class III Directors. Holders of common stock are not allowed to cumulate their
votes in the election of Class III Directors. Shares represented by proxies
which are marked "withhold authority" will have the same effect as a vote
against the nominees. The Class III Directors are to hold office until the 2004
annual meeting of stockholders and until their respective successors are duly
qualified and elected.

NOMINEES FOR CLASS III DIRECTOR:

        Jeffrey H. Coats

        Robert S. Grimes

     THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS RECOMMENDS THAT THE STOCKHOLDERS VOTE FOR THE
ELECTION OF THE NOMINEES NAMED ABOVE UNDER "NOMINEES FOR CLASS III DIRECTOR." It
is intended that shares represented by the proxies will be voted FOR the
election to the board of directors of the persons named below unless authority
to vote for the nominees has been withheld in the proxy. Although the persons
nominated have consented to serve as directors if elected, and the board of
directors has no reason to believe that the nominees will be unable to serve as
directors, if any nominee withdraws or otherwise becomes unavailable to serve,
the persons named as proxies will vote for any substitute nominee designated by
the board of directors. The following information regarding Autobytel's
directors and executive officers, including nominees, is relevant to your
consideration of the slate proposed by your board of directors:

                          RATIFICATION AND APPROVAL OF
                   AUTOBYTEL'S INDEPENDENT PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS

     The board of directors has selected Andersen LLP to audit the financial
statements of Autobytel for the year ended December 31, 2001. Andersen LLP has
audited Autobytel's financial statements since 1995.

     THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS RECOMMENDS THAT THE STOCKHOLDERS VOTE FOR THE
PROPOSAL TO RATIFY AND APPROVE THE SELECTION OF ANDERSEN LLP AS AUTOBYTEL'S
INDEPENDENT PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS FOR FISCAL 2001.

     It is expected that a representative of Andersen LLP will be present at the
annual meeting to respond to any questions and to make a statement on behalf of
his or her firm, if such representative so desires.

                                 FEE DISCLOSURE

AUDIT FEES

     The aggregate fees billed by Andersen LLP for professional services
rendered for the audit of Autobytel's annual financial statements for the year
ended December 31, 2000 and for the reviews of the financial statements included
in Autobytel's Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for that year were $147,000.

FINANCIAL INFORMATION SYSTEMS DESIGN AND IMPLEMENTATION FEES

     No fees were billed by Andersen LLP for professional services rendered for
financial information systems design and implementation for the year ended
December 31, 2000.

ALL OTHER FEES

     The aggregate fees billed by Andersen LLP for services rendered to
Autobytel, other than for services described above, for the year ended December
31, 2000 were approximately $220,000. These other services consisted of audit
and tax related services, such as review of the Securities and Exchange
Commission filings, tax compliance and consultations on accounting and tax
matters.

     The audit committee has determined that the provision of services rendered
above is compatible with maintaining Andersen LLP's independence.

                              AUTOBYTEL PROPOSAL 4

                      APPROVAL OF AMENDMENT TO CERTIFICATE
                         OF INCORPORATION CHANGING NAME

     The board of directors of Autobytel has unanimously approved and directed
that there be submitted to stockholders for their approval an amendment to
Article I of Autobytel's Fifth Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation
to change the name of Autobytel to "Autobytel Inc." To effect such a change,
Article I of Autobytel's Fifth Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation
will be amended to read in its entirety as follows:

                                   "ARTICLE I

      The name of the corporation is Autobytel Inc. (the "Corporation")."

     This amendment to change the name of Autobytel, if approved by the
stockholders, will become effective on the date the amendment is filed with the
Secretary of State of Delaware. Autobytel anticipates that the filing to effect
the name change will be made as soon as practicable after the annual meeting.

     The board of directors has determined that a change in the Autobytel name
is advisable because Autobytel owns more than one automotive Web site. The name
change will not affect the validity of currently outstanding stock certificates.
Autobytel's current stockholders will not be required to surrender or exchange
any stock certificates that they now hold and should not send such certificates
to Autobytel or its transfer agent.

     THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS OF AUTOBYTEL RECOMMENDS THAT THE STOCKHOLDERS VOTE
FOR THE PROPOSAL TO APPROVE THE AMENDMENT TO AUTOBYTEL'S FIFTH AMENDED AND
RESTATED CERTIFICATE OF INCORPORATION TO CHANGE THE NAME OF AUTOBYTEL AS
DESCRIBED ABOVE.

PURPOSE OF THE ANNUAL MEETING

     Autoweb is furnishing this joint proxy statement/prospectus to its
stockholders in connection with the solicitation of proxies by the board of
directors of Autoweb relating to the proposed merger with Autobytel. This proxy
statement and the accompanying form of proxy were first mailed to stockholders
on or about                            , 2001. The Autoweb board of directors
will use the proxies at the annual meeting of stockholders of Autoweb to be held
on                            , 2001 and at any adjournment or postponement
thereof.

     The annual meeting is being held so that Autoweb stockholders may consider
and vote upon the following proposals:

     (1) To approve a merger of a wholly owned subsidiary of Autobytel with and
         into Autoweb whereby each outstanding share of Autoweb common stock
         will be converted into the right to receive 0.3553 shares of Autobytel
         common stock and the acquisition agreement dated as of April 11, 2001,
         by and among Autobytel, Autobytel Acquisition I Corp. and Autoweb.

     (2) To elect two Class II directors, each to serve until such director's
         successor has been elected and qualified or until such director's
         earlier resignation or removal. Autoweb's board of directors intends to
         present the following nominees for election as Class II directors:

               Lawrence W. Lepard and Jeffrey A. Schwartz

     (3) To ratify the selection of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP as Autoweb's
         independent auditors for 2001.

     (4) To transact such other business as may properly come before the annual
         meeting.

RECORD DATE AND OUTSTANDING SHARES

     The board of directors of Autoweb has fixed the close of business on
            , 2001 as the record date for the annual meeting. Only holders of
record of Autoweb common stock at the close of business on the record date are
entitled to notice of and to vote at the meeting. As of the close of business on
the record date, there were                shares of Autoweb common stock
outstanding and entitled to vote, held of record by approximately
               stockholders, although Autoweb has been informed that there are
approximately                beneficial owners.

VOTE AND QUORUM REQUIRED

     Holders of Autoweb common stock are entitled to one vote for each share
held as of the record date. Attendance at the meeting in person or by proxy of a
majority of the outstanding shares of Autoweb common stock is required for a
quorum. Approval of the merger and acquisition agreement requires the
affirmative vote of a majority of the shares of Autoweb common stock outstanding
on the record date. Election of the directors requires a plurality of the votes
of the shares present in person or represented by proxy at the meeting and
entitled to vote on the election of directors. Approval of any other matter
shall be decided by the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the
shares of stock entitled to vote

thereon, that are present in person or represented by proxy at the meeting and
are voted for or against the matter.

     On the record date, the directors and executive officers of Autoweb as a
group beneficially owned                shares of Autoweb common stock
(excluding any shares issuable upon the exercise of options). Certain
stockholders, directors and executive officers of Autoweb have entered into
stockholder voting agreements with Autobytel that obligate them to vote, with
respect to a total of approximately      % of Autoweb common shares outstanding
as of the record date, in favor of approval of the merger and acquisition
agreement.

SOLICITATION OF PROXY

     The proxy is solicited by and on behalf of the board of directors of
Autoweb. Autoweb will also be using the proxy solicitation firm of Regan &
Associates. In addition to solicitation by mail, directors, officers and key
employees of Autoweb may solicit proxies in person or by telephone, telegram or
other means of communication. These persons will receive no additional
compensation for solicitation of proxies, but may be reimbursed for reasonable
out-of-pocket expenses.

VOTING OF PROXIES; ABSTENTIONS AND BROKER NON-VOTES

     All properly executed proxies received before the vote at the annual
meeting and not revoked, will be voted in accordance with the instructions
indicated on the proxies. If no instructions are indicated, such proxies will be
voted FOR each of the aforementioned proposals, and the proxy holder may vote
the proxy in its discretion as to any other matter which may properly come
before the meeting.

     In the event that a broker, bank, custodian, nominee or other record holder
of Autoweb common stock indicates on a proxy that it does not have discretionary
authority to vote certain shares on a particular matter, which is called a
broker non-vote, those shares will be counted for purposes of determining the
presence or absence of a quorum for the transaction of business but will count
as a vote against the proposal to approve the merger.

DISSENTERS' RIGHTS

     Under Delaware law, Autoweb stockholders are not entitled to dissent from
the merger.

EXPENSES OF PROXY SOLICITATION

     The fee for the proxy solicitation services of Regan & Associates is
$6,500.00, which includes all expenses incurred in connection with these
services. Autoweb will pay the expenses of soliciting proxies to be voted at the
meeting, except that Autobytel will share equally the expenses incurred in
connection with filing and printing this joint proxy statement/prospectus.
Following the original mailing of the proxies and other soliciting materials,
Autoweb will request brokers, custodians, nominees and other record holders of
Autoweb common stock to forward copies of the proxy and other soliciting
materials to persons for whom they hold shares of Autoweb common stock and to
request authority for the exercise of proxies. In such cases, upon the request
of the record holders, Autoweb will reimburse such holders for their reasonable
expenses.

PROXIES

     The proxy accompanying this joint proxy statement/prospectus is solicited
on behalf of the Autoweb board of directors for use at the meeting. Please
complete, date and sign the accompanying proxy and promptly return it in the
enclosed envelope or otherwise mail it to the corporate offices of Autoweb to
the attention of the corporate secretary.

     The board of directors of Autoweb does not know of any matter that is not
referred to in this joint proxy statement/prospectus to be presented for action
at the meeting. If any other matters are properly

brought before the meeting, the persons named in the proxies will have
discretion to vote on such matters in accordance with their best judgment.

REVOCABILITY OF PROXY

     Any person signing a proxy given pursuant to this solicitation has the
power to revoke it before the annual meeting or at the annual meeting before the
vote pursuant to the proxy. A proxy may be revoked by a writing delivered to
Autoweb stating that the proxy is revoked, by a subsequent proxy that is signed
by the person who signed the earlier proxy and is presented at the annual
meeting, or by attendance at the annual meeting and voting in person.

     Please note, however, that if your shares are held of record by a broker,
bank or other nominee and you wish to vote at the meeting, you must bring to the
meeting a letter from the broker, bank or other nominee confirming your
beneficial ownership of the shares.

RECOMMENDATION OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS

     The board of directors of Autoweb has unanimously determined that the terms
of the acquisition agreement and the merger are fair, advisable and in the best
interests of Autoweb and the Autoweb stockholders. Accordingly, the Autoweb
board of directors recommends that Autoweb stockholders vote FOR the proposal to
approve the merger and the acquisition agreement, FOR the proposal to elect two
Class II directors and FOR the proposal to ratify the selection of
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP as Autoweb's independent auditors for 2001.

TO ASSURE THAT YOUR SHARES ARE REPRESENTED AT THE MEETING, PLEASE COMPLETE, DATE
AND SIGN THE ENCLOSED PROXY AND MAIL IT PROMPTLY IN THE POSTAGE-PAID ENVELOPE
PROVIDED, WHETHER OR NOT YOU PLAN TO ATTEND THE MEETING. YOU MAY REVOKE YOUR
PROXY AT ANY TIME BEFORE IT IS VOTED.

                      RATIFICATION AND APPROVAL OF MERGER
                           AND ACQUISITION AGREEMENT

     The merger will be consummated on the terms and subject to the conditions
set forth in the acquisition agreement. As a result of the merger, a wholly
owned subsidiary of Autobytel will be merged with and into Autoweb, with Autoweb
as the surviving corporation. Autobytel will issue 0.3553 shares of common stock
in exchange for each share of outstanding common stock of Autoweb.

     You are encouraged to read the sections of this joint proxy
statement/prospectus entitled "Merger" on page   and "Acquisition Agreement" on
page   .

     THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS OF AUTOWEB BELIEVES THAT THE TERMS OF THE MERGER ARE
FAIR, ADVISABLE AND IN THE BEST INTERESTS OF AUTOWEB AND ITS STOCKHOLDERS AND
RECOMMENDS THAT AUTOWEB STOCKHOLDERS VOTE FOR THE PROPOSAL TO RATIFY, APPROVE
AND ADOPT THE MERGER AND THE ACQUISITION AGREEMENT.

     In considering the recommendation of the Autoweb board of directors with
respect to the merger, you should be aware that certain directors and officers
of Autoweb have certain interests in the merger that are different from, or are
in addition to, the interests of Autoweb's stockholders generally. Please see
the section of this joint proxy statement/prospectus entitled "Interests of
Autoweb Directors, Officers, Employees and Significant Stockholders in the
Merger" on page   .

                               AUTOWEB PROPOSAL 2

             NOMINATION AND ELECTION OF AUTOWEB CLASS II DIRECTORS

     The board of directors of Autoweb presently consists of six members and is
divided into three equal classes, with one vacancy. Each class serves three
years, with the terms of office of the respective classes expiring in successive
years. Directors in Class II will stand for election at the annual meeting and
if elected, will serve on Autoweb's board of directors in the event the merger
is not consummated. The terms of office of directors in Class I and Class III do
not expire until the annual meetings of stockholders held in 2003 and 2002,
respectively. The board of directors proposes that each of the Class II nominees
named below, both of whom are currently serving as Class II directors, be
re-elected as a Class II director for a three-year term expiring at the annual
meeting of stockholders in 2004 and until such director's successor is duly
elected and qualified or until such director's earlier resignation or removal.
THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS RECOMMENDS THAT THE STOCKHOLDERS VOTE FOR THE ELECTION OF
THE NOMINEES NAMED BELOW UNDER "NOMINEES TO THE BOARD." Shares represented by
the accompanying proxy will be voted for the election of each of the two
nominees named below unless the proxy is marked in such a manner as to withhold
authority so to vote. If any nominee for any reason is unable to serve or for
good cause will not serve, the proxies may be voted for such substitute nominee
as the proxy holder may determine. Autoweb is not aware of any nominee who will
be unable to or for good cause will not serve as a director.

     During 2000, the board of directors met 11 times, including telephone
conference meetings and acted by written consent 6 times. No director attended
fewer than 75% of the aggregate of the total number of meetings of the board of
directors (held during the period for which he was a director) and the total
number of meetings held by all committees of the board of directors on which
such director served (during the period that such director served).

     Standing committees of the board of directors include an audit committee
and a compensation committee.

     The current members of the audit committee are Messrs. Hoag, Lepard and
Ross. The audit committee met 3 times during 2000. The audit committee meets
with Autoweb's independent auditors to review the adequacy of Autoweb's internal
control systems and financial reporting procedures; reviews the general scope of
Autoweb's annual audit and the fees charged by the independent auditors; reviews
and monitors the performance of non-audit services by Autoweb's auditors;
reviews the fairness of any proposed transaction between any officer, director
or other affiliate of Autoweb, and after such review, makes recommendations to
the full board of directors; and performs such further functions as may be
required by any stock exchange or over-the-counter market upon which Autoweb's
common stock may be listed.

     The current members of the compensation committee are Messrs. Hoag, Lepard
and Ross. The compensation committee met 3 times and has not acted by written
consent during 2000. The compensation committee recommends compensation for
officers and employees of Autoweb, grants options and stock awards under
Autoweb's employee benefit plans and reviews and recommends adoption of and
amendments to stock option and employee benefit plans.

COMPENSATION COMMITTEE INTERLOCKS AND INSIDER PARTICIPATION

     None of the members of the compensation committee of the board of directors
has at any time since Autoweb's formation been an officer or employee of
Autoweb. No executive officer of Autoweb serves as a member of the board of
directors or compensation committee of any entity that has one or more executive
officers serving on Autoweb's board of directors or compensation committee.

DIRECTOR COMPENSATION

     Autoweb's directors do not receive cash compensation for their services as
directors but are reimbursed for their reasonable and necessary expenses for
attending board of directors and board committee meetings. Members of the board
of directors who are not employees of Autoweb, or any parent, subsidiary or
affiliate of Autoweb, are eligible to participate in Autoweb's 1999 Directors
Stock Option Plan unless they are representatives of venture capital funds or
corporate investors.

     In January 1999, Autoweb's board of directors adopted, and in March 1999
its stockholders approved, the 1999 Directors Stock Option Plan. Autoweb has
reserved a total of 150,000 shares of common stock for issuance under the
directors' plan. Members of the board of directors who are not employees of
Autoweb, or any parent, subsidiary or affiliate of Autoweb, will be eligible to
participate in the directors plan unless they are representatives of venture
capital funds or corporate investors. The option grants under the directors plan
are automatic and nondiscretionary, and the exercise price of the options must
be 100% of the fair market value of the common stock on the date of grant. Each
eligible director who becomes a

member of the board of directors will initially be granted an option to purchase
15,000 shares (an "Initial Grant") on the date the director first becomes a
director. Immediately following each annual meeting of Autoweb's stockholders,
each eligible director will automatically be granted an additional option to
purchase 7,500 shares if the director has served continuously as a member of the
board since the date of the director's Initial Grant. The term of these options
is ten years, provided that they will terminate seven months following the date
the director ceases to be a director or a consultant of Autoweb or twelve months
if the termination is due to death or disability. All options granted under the
directors plan will vest over four years at a rate of 2.08% per month, provided
the optionee continues as a member of the board of directors or as a consultant
to Autoweb. In the event of Autoweb's dissolution or liquidation or a "change in
control" transaction, options granted under the directors plan will become 100%
vested and exercisable in full.

                               AUTOWEB PROPOSAL 3

          RATIFICATION OF SELECTION OF AUTOWEB'S INDEPENDENT AUDITORS

     Autoweb has selected PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP as its independent auditors
to perform the audit of Autoweb's financial statements for the year ending
December 31, 2001, and the stockholders are being asked to ratify such
selection.

     PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP has been Autoweb's independent auditor since
October 3, 1995. Representatives of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP will be present
at the annual meeting, with the opportunity to make a statement if they desire
to do so, and will be available to respond to appropriate questions.

     THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS RECOMMENDS A VOTE FOR THE RATIFICATION OF THE
SELECTION OF PRICEWATERHOUSECOOPERS LLP.

                                 FEE DISCLOSURE

AUDIT FEES

     The aggregate fees billed by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP for professional
services rendered for the audit of Autoweb's annual financial statements for the
year ended December 31, 2000 and for the reviews of the financial statements
included in Autoweb's Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for that year were
$215,000, of which an aggregate amount of $110,000 has been billed through
December 31, 2000.

FINANCIAL INFORMATION SYSTEMS DESIGN AND IMPLEMENTATION FEES

     No fees were billed by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP for professional services
rendered for financial information systems design and implementation for the
year ended December 31, 2000.

ALL OTHER FEES

     The aggregate fees billed by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP for services
rendered to Autoweb, other than for services described above, for the year ended
December 31, 2000 were approximately $17,600. These other services consisted of
audit and tax related services, such as review of the Securities and Exchange
Commission filings, tax compliance and consultations on accounting and tax
matters.

     The audit committee has determined that the provision of services rendered
above for financial information systems design and implementation fees, and all
other fees is compatible with maintaining PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP's
independence.

                               AUTOBYTEL BUSINESS

OVERVIEW

     Autobytel is an internationally branded online automotive commerce company
that provides consumers with automotive solutions throughout the lifecycle of
vehicle ownership, capturing revenue at multiple stages. Autobytel owns leading,
branded Internet sites for new and pre-owned vehicle information and automotive
services that link buyers and sellers in an information-rich environment.
Through Autobytel's Web sites, www.autobytel.com and www.carsmart.com, consumers
can research pricing, specifications and other information regarding new and
pre-owned vehicles and purchase, finance, lease, insure, sell or maintain their
vehicles. Autobytel believes that its services provide benefits for consumers by
supplying them with information to make informed and intelligent vehicle
decisions throughout the lifecycle of vehicle ownership.

     Consumers can purchase new vehicles through Autobytel's dealer referral
network. When consumers indicate they are ready to buy a vehicle, they can be
connected to Autobytel's network of over 4,700 participating dealers in North
America as of March 31, 2001, of which approximately 3,500 are Autobytel.com(R)
dealers and approximately 1,200 are CarSmart.com(SM) dealers, with each dealer
representing a particular vehicle make. Approximately 400 dealers subscribe to
both the Autobytel and CarSmart services. Dealers participate in Autobytel's
network by entering into non-exclusive contracts with Autobytel. Autobytel
expects its dealers to promptly provide a haggle-free, competitive offer. Fees
paid by participating dealers constitute the majority of Autobytel's revenues.

     Consumers can purchase pre-owned vehicles through Autobytel's Pre-Owned
CyberStore. The Pre-Owned CyberStore allows consumers to search for a pre-owned
vehicle according to the price, make, model, color, year and location of the
vehicle. The CyberStore locates and displays the description, location and, if
available, actual photograph of vehicles that satisfy the consumer's search
parameters.

     Autobytel's MyGarage service area is designed to empower consumers by
providing cost effective and efficient processes for dealing with common service
and maintenance issues. The site enhances consumer personalization and includes
key components such as access to Autobytel Accredited Service Centers, the
ability to schedule service and maintenance appointments online and receive
information such as service reminders and recall information.

     Consumers can also apply for and receive insurance, financing, leasing and
warranty proposals as well as other services and information through Autobytel's
Web sites. In an arrangement with Peoplefirst Autobytel provides consumers with
access to competitive loan rates. Autobytel also provides a link on its Web
sites so consumers can receive real-time quotes for insurance coverage from
Channelpoint Corporation and submit quote applications online. Participants in
the program include The Hartford (Hartford Financial Services Group, Inc.), The
GE Auto Insurance Program and Ekemper.

     In 1999 and 2000, Autobytel established joint ventures and entered into
licensing agreements in Europe, Japan and Australia and is exploring additional
opportunities in Europe, Asia and Latin America. Autobytel receives fees from
licensing agreements.

     In February 2000, Autobytel acquired A.I.N. Corporation, the owner of
CarSmart, one of the leading online buying sites for new and pre-owned vehicles,
for 1.8 million shares of Autobytel common stock and $3 million in cash. As of
March 31, 2001, CarSmart had approximately 1,200 dealers, established
relationships with more than 200 credit unions and strategic marketing
agreements with several of the top Internet portals, including AOL.com, Alta
Vista and GO2Net. Autobytel is currently in the process of integrating the
executive and administrative personnel of CarSmart into its operations.
Autobytel continues to operate CarSmart as a separate Web site, and Autobytel
has not yet determined whether it will integrate it into the Autobytel Web site
in the future.

     In January 2001, Autobytel introduced iManager(SM), a multi-functional
dealer management system and an upgrade of its Dealer Real Time(R) system.
Autobytel is converting the Autobytel dealers from the Dealer Real Time system
to iManager. The iManager system provides dealers with immediate purchase

request information for new and pre-owned vehicles, the ability to track
multiple customers and purchase requests, turnkey customer retention programs,
automatic uploading of new and pre-owned vehicle inventory into Autobytel's
database, reporting systems, including transaction status, customer information
and Internet department performance, and other features. The CarSmart dealers
use a dealer system called SmarTrack.

     In February 2001, Autobytel signed an agreement with General Motors
Corporation (GM) to conduct a 90-day test of a new GM online locate-to-order
business model. The model involves modification of Autobytel's existing Web site
for consumers from the Washington, D.C. metropolitan area. The test program,
which commenced on May 1, 2001, combines the independent all makes, all models
capability of Autobytel with a dealer-set online e-price and locate-to-order
vehicle inventory model for Chevrolet vehicles.

     In May 2001, as part of a periodic review of its business lines, Autobytel
decided to suspend operations of its locate-to-order service, AutobytelDIRECT.
Autobytel believes that the program was unable to attain the scale required to
be profitable. In the future, Autobytel may reintroduce a locate-to-order
service depending on market conditions.

     Autobytel is a Delaware corporation incorporated on May 17, 1996. It was
previously formed in Delaware in January 1995 as a limited liability company
under the name Auto-By-Tel LLC. Autobytel's principal corporate offices are
located in Irvine, California. Autobytel completed its initial public offering
in March 1999 and its common stock is listed on the Nasdaq National Market under
the symbol "ABTL."

BACKGROUND

     Growth of the Internet and Online Commerce. The Web and online services
have emerged as significant global communications and commercial media enabling
millions of people worldwide to share information, communicate and conduct
business electronically. Autobytel believes that the number of Web users will
grow based on a number of factors, including the large and growing base of
installed personal computers in the home and workplace, the decreasing cost of
personal computers, easier, faster and cheaper access to the Internet, the
distribution of broadband applications, the proliferation of Internet content
and the increasing familiarity and acceptance of the Internet by businesses and
consumers.

     The growth in the use of the Internet has also led to a rapid growth of
online commerce. Web commerce sites are enabling businesses to target and manage
a broad customer base and establish and maintain ongoing direct customer
relationships. As a growing number of businesses and information providers have
begun marketing on the Web, it has rapidly become a medium in which consumers
can access a vast amount of information regarding the pricing, quality and
specification of products. Additionally, online transactions can be faster, less
expensive and more convenient than transactions conducted in person or over the
telephone.

     The Automotive Vehicle Market. Automotive dealers operate in localized
markets and face significant state regulations and increasing business
pressures. These fragmented markets, with approximately 47,000 dealers in
aggregate, are characterized by:

     - a perceived overabundance of dealerships,

     - competitive sales within regional markets,

     - increasing advertising and marketing costs that continue to reduce dealer
       profits,

     - high-pressure sales tactics with consumers, and

     - large investments by dealers in real estate, construction, personnel and
       other overhead expenses.

     In addition, consumers have traditionally entered into the highly
negotiated sales process with relatively little information regarding
manufacturer's costs, leasing costs, financing costs, relative specifications
and other important information. Buying a vehicle is considered to be one of the
most significant purchases a United States consumer makes. According to Manheim
Auctions, approximately

$744 billion and $702 billion was spent on new and pre-owned vehicles in the
United States representing the sale of approximately 59 million and 58 million
vehicles in 2000 and 1999, respectively. Although automotive retailing attracts
significant consumer dollars, Autobytel believes that consumers associate the
traditional vehicle buying experience with high-pressure sales tactics.

THE AUTOBYTEL.COM SOLUTION

     Autobytel believes that its online products and services improve the
vehicle purchasing process for both consumers and dealers. Autobytel offers
consumers information-rich Web sites, numerous tools to configure this
information, and a quality fulfillment experience. As part of the fulfillment
experience, Autobytel expects its dealers to provide competitive price quotes
for new and pre-owned vehicles. Autobytel believes its services enable dealers
to reduce personnel and marketing costs, increase consumer satisfaction and
increase customer volume.

     Benefits to Consumers. Autobytel's Web sites provide consumers free of
charge up-to-date specifications and pricing information on vehicles. In
addition, Autobytel's consumers gain easy access to valuable automotive
information, such as dealer invoice pricing and tools consisting of a lease
calculator, a loan calculator to determine monthly payments and a lease or buy
decision assistant. Autobytel's database of articles allows consumers to perform
online library research by accessing documents such as weekly automotive
reports, consumer reviews and manufacturer brochures. Various automotive
information service providers, such as Edmund's, Kelley Blue Book, Pace
Publication's Carprice.com and IntelliChoice, are also available on Autobytel's
Web site to assist consumers with specific vehicle and related automotive
decisions such as insurance and financing. Armed with such information, the
consumer should be more confident and capable of making an informed and
intelligent vehicle buying decision.

     Autobytel believes it offers consumers a significantly different vehicle
purchasing experience from that of traditional methods. Consumers using
Autobytel's Web sites are able to shop for a vehicle, and make financing and
insurance decisions from the convenience of their own home or office. Autobytel
expects dealers to provide consumers a haggle-free price quote within 24 hours
and a high level of customer service. Autobytel forms its dealer relationships
after careful analysis of automotive sales and demographic data in each region.
Autobytel seeks to include in its dealer network the highest quality dealers
within defined territories.

     Benefits to Dealers. Autobytel believes it benefits dealers by reducing the
dealers' incremental personnel and marketing costs, increasing consumer
satisfaction and increasing sales volume. Through Autobytel's investment in
national advertising and brand recognition of Autobytel and CarSmart, it
attracts consumers to Autobytel's Web sites and, based on the consumers'
preference, Autobytel directs them to dealers in their local area. Autobytel
believes this provides dealers access to a larger number of prequalified
consumers. Autobytel believes dealers' personnel costs should be reduced because
Autobytel provides dealers access to potential purchasers who have completed
their research and should be ready to buy or lease a vehicle. As a result,
reaching these consumers and selling or leasing them vehicles costs the dealer
little or no additional overhead expense other than the fees paid to Autobytel
and the personnel costs of a dedicated manager. Through Autobytel's iManager and
Dealer Real Time systems, Autobytel provides dealers with on-site technology to
better track sales, inventory, customer solicitations, responses and other
communications.

     By providing consumers a quality fulfillment experience, Autobytel seeks to
provide its dealers a large number of consumers, which allows them to compete
more effectively. Autobytel's solution includes a network of over 4,700
participating dealers in the United States and Canada, as of March 31, 2001,
representing every major domestic and imported make of vehicles and light
trucks.

     To incent a dealer to participate in the Autobytel or CarSmart network,
Autobytel allocates each dealer an exclusive geographic territory in such
network based upon specific vehicle make. A territory allocated by Autobytel to
a dealer is generally larger than a territory assigned to a dealer by a
manufacturer.

     Autobytel's Web Sites. Because Web sites can be continually updated and
provide a large quantity of quality information, Autobytel believes the Internet
offers the most efficient medium for consumers to learn about and shop for
vehicles. The Internet's global reach to consumers allows Autobytel to leverage
its investment in branding and marketing across a very large national and
international audience to create qualified purchase requests for vehicles. For
these reasons, Autobytel also believes that the Internet represents the most
efficient method of directing purchase requests to local markets and dealers.

     Autobytel currently provides the following services on its Autobytel.com
Web site:

                                  [FLOW CHART]

     CarSmart currently provides the following services on its Web site:

STRATEGY

     Autobytel's primary objective is to connect buyers and sellers in an
information-rich environment throughout the vehicle ownership lifecycle.
Autobytel intends to achieve this objective through the following principal
strategies:

     Continue to Build Brand Equity. Autobytel believes that due to its focus on
both online and traditional marketing, it owns two of the leading brand names in
its sector. Autobytel intends to continue to market and advertise to enhance its
brand recognition with consumers. Autobytel believes that continuing to
strengthen brand awareness of the Autobytel and CarSmart names among consumers
is critical to attract vehicle buyers, increase purchase requests and, in turn,
maintain and increase the size of Autobytel's dealer base. Autobytel intends to
continue advertising on the Internet and through traditional media, such as
television, radio and print publications.

     Ensure the Highest Quality Consumer Experience. Autobytel believes that
consumer satisfaction and loyalty is heavily influenced by the consumer's
experience with its sites and with its dealers. In order to enhance Autobytel's
appeal to consumers, Autobytel intends to continue developing its Web sites by
enhancing vehicle information and personalization. Autobytel formed I-Net
Training Technologies LLC with third parties to provide dealers with more
extensive training and tools to facilitate Internet selling of vehicles. In
addition, Autobytel plans to continue compiling high quality content from third
party sources on its sites, including information from Edmund's, IntelliChoice,
Carprices.com and Kelley Blue Book. Autobytel believes that consumer
satisfaction with the vehicle purchasing experience is also essential to its
success and the differentiation of its services from those of its competitors.
Autobytel intends to continue to invest in its dealer training and support
services to ensure a consistent, high-quality alternative to the traditional
vehicle buying process.

     Increase Purchase Requests. Autobytel believes that increasing the volume
and quality of purchase requests directed from its Web sites to its dealer
networks is crucial to the long-term growth and success of Autobytel's business.
By augmenting the volume of quality purchase requests, Autobytel expects to
attract additional dealers to Autobytel's networks, increase fees paid by
dealers, and solidify its relationships with participating dealers. Autobytel's
strategy for increasing traffic to its sites and the number of purchase requests
includes forming and maintaining online sponsorships and alliances with Internet
portals and with Internet automotive information providers. As part of
Autobytel's strategy to improve the quality of purchase requests, Autobytel
continues to expand the breadth and depth of information and services available
through Autobytel's Web sites so that well informed, ready-to-buy consumers can
be directed to participating dealers.

     Expand and Improve Dealer Network. Autobytel believes that strengthening
the size and quality of its dealer networks is important to the success and
growth of Autobytel's business. Autobytel's strategy is to increase the size of
its dealer networks by attracting new dealers and strengthening relationships
with existing dealers by:

     - increasing the volume and quality of purchase requests,

     - advertising in trade publications aimed at dealers and participating in
       industry trade shows,

     - maintaining Autobytel's extensive training and support programs to
       participating dealers, and

     - providing Autobytel's iManager, Dealer Real Time or SmarTrack systems, as
       applicable, to all participating dealers.

     Invest in Related Products and Services. Autobytel believes that expanding
its products and services to both consumers and dealers is critical to establish
itself as the premier provider of online automotive products and services.
Autobytel's strategy is to continue to enhance personalization features and
invest in related products and services, such as the CyberStore, maintenance and
service, and warranty, finance and insurance services. The iManager, Dealer Real
Time and SmarTrack systems will allow Autobytel to launch new products and
services for Autobytel's dealers. Autobytel also allows dealers to offer
accessories directly through its Web sites. Autobytel expanded the advertising
sales on its Web sites and marketed the

information in its database in accordance with its privacy policy. Autobytel
expects to further expand these businesses.

     Expand Internationally. Autobytel intends to continue its international
expansion through licensing agreements and joint ventures with local strategic
investors. In January 2000, Autobytel.Europe LLC and Autobytel entered into an
operating agreement with Inchcape plc, Pon Holdings B.V. and GE Capital Equity
Holdings, Inc. to expand its existing operations and business throughout Europe.
Autobytel licensed its technology, business processes and trade name to
Autobytel.Europe on a royalty free perpetual basis and contributed to
Autobytel.Europe its existing license agreements for the United Kingdom and
Scandinavia and Finland. In turn, Autobytel.Europe intends to license such
technology, business processes and trade name to other national operating
companies in European countries. Autobytel.Europe will usually invest in such
national operating companies or obtain options to acquire equity positions in
such companies. Autobytel.Europe currently has licensing agreements for the
United Kingdom, Sweden, Spain and The Netherlands and intends to establish
licensing agreements in Germany, France and Italy as well as certain other
countries in Western and Eastern Europe. Autobytel has also established joint
ventures in Japan and Australia with several strategic investors. Autobytel is
currently exploring additional opportunities in Asia and Latin America.

PRODUCTS, PROGRAMS AND SERVICES

     New Vehicle Purchasing Service. Autobytel's new vehicle purchasing service
enables consumers to shop for and select a new vehicle through its Web sites by
providing research on new vehicles such as pricing, features, specifications and
colors. When consumers indicate they are ready to buy a vehicle, a consumer can
complete a purchase request online, which specifies the type of vehicle and
accessories the consumer desires, along with the consumer's contact information.
The purchase request is then routed by Autobytel to the nearest participating
dealer that sells the type of vehicle requested, and Autobytel promptly returns
an e-mail message to the consumer with the dealership's name and phone number
and the name of the dedicated manager at the dealership. Dealers agree in their
contracts to contact the consumer within 24 hours of receiving the purchase
request with a firm, haggle-free price quote for the requested vehicle. When
consumers complete their purchase, they usually take delivery of their vehicle
at the dealership showroom. Generally, within 14 days of the submission of a
consumer's purchase request, Autobytel contacts the consumer again by e-mail to
conduct a quality assurance survey that allows Autobytel to evaluate the sales
process at participating dealers and improve the quality of dealer service.

     Autobytel's network had over 4,700 dealers as of March 31, 2001, which
represents a decline from the number of dealers Autobytel had as of December 31,
2000, of which approximately 3,500 are Autobytel dealers and approximately 1,200
are CarSmart dealers. Approximately 400 dealers subscribe to both the
Autobytel.com and CarSmart.com services. These dealers represent every major
domestic and imported make of vehicle and light truck sold in the United States
and Canada. Dealerships are charged initial subscription fees and on-going fees,
principally on a monthly basis.

     Pre-Owned CyberStore. Autobytel launched its CyberStore program in April
1997. The CyberStore allows consumers to search for a certified or non-certified
pre-owned vehicle according to specific search parameters such as the price,
make, model, mileage, year and location of the vehicle. CyberStore locates and
displays the description, location and, if available, actual digital photograph
of vehicles that satisfy the search parameters. The consumer can then complete a
formal purchase request for a specific vehicle and is contacted by the dealer to
conclude the sale. To be listed in the CyberStore a certified pre-owned vehicle
must pass an extensive inspection and be covered by a 72-hour money-back
guarantee and a three-month, 3,000-mile warranty, which is honored nationally by
certified Pre-Owned CyberStore dealers. Autobytel charges each vehicle dealer
that participates in the CyberStore program a separate additional monthly fee.
The CyberStore program uses the iManager and Dealer Real Time systems to provide
participating dealers online purchase requests shortly after submission by
consumers as well as the ability to track their inventory on a real-time basis.

     Service and Maintenance. In June 1999, Autobytel launched a comprehensive
site designed to facilitate the service process for consumers. The site is
designed to empower consumers with cost effective and efficient processes for
dealing with common service and maintenance issues. The site enhances consumer
personalization. It includes key components such as access to Autobytel
Accredited Service Centers and the ability to schedule service and maintenance
appointments online. At the My Garage area consumers can store and receive
information about their cars and trucks, such as service reminders, recall
information and a lease watch to help keep track of mileage on a leased vehicle.
The site offers "Ask the Expert", a section that offers answers to frequently
asked service and maintenance questions. In addition, the site offers travel and
weather information as well as maps.

     Participating service centers must commit to respond to consumers within 24
hours with competitive no-haggle service prices. The site enables dealers to use
the Internet to further serve their customers.

     Other Related Products and Services. Autobytel offers a number of related
products and services that it markets to consumers through its Web sites and the
linked Web sites of participating third party providers. Autobytel makes
purchase and lease financing available to consumers through Peoplefirst that
allow consumers to research and apply for vehicle financing online in a secure
manner. Consumers can apply for a loan or lease online at the time they submit
their purchase request for either a new or pre-owned vehicle. Consumers are able
to arrive at the dealership with their loan pre-approved and their credit
verification documents in hand. Autobytel believes that the convenience of
pre-approved purchase or lease financing, combined with a firm, competitive
price, enables dealers more easily to consummate purchase requests. Peoplefirst
pays Autobytel a referral fee and an origination fee for most loans.

     Autobytel provides a link on its Web sites so consumers can receive
real-time quotes for insurance coverage from Channelpoint Corporation and submit
quote applications online. Participants in the program include The Hartford
(Hartford Financial Services Group, Inc.), The GE Auto Insurance Program and
Ekemper. As of March 31, 2001, the service was available to consumers in 37
states and the District of Columbia. Autobytel typically receives a marketing
fee for every quote application sent to a participating insurance company or
agent by a consumer accessing the Channelpoint Web site through its Web sites.
In addition, Autobytel provides Warrantybynet Inc.'s warranty products and
receive fees per warranty sold.

     Autobytel offers information concerning all aspects of owning and leasing
new and pre-owned vehicles that it believes makes its Web sites valuable
resources to consumers. Autobytel also offers a lease calculator and a loan
calculator to determine monthly payments and a lease or buy decision tool.

     The iManager System. In 1997, Autobytel launched a proprietary technology
and software system called the Dealer Real Time system. The Dealer Real Time
system is an Internet-based communications platform that gives dealers a
competitive advantage compared to delivering purchase requests by fax. In
January 2001 Autobytel launched iManager, an upgrade of the Dealer Real Time
system.

     Using Internet technology, the iManager system enables the dealer to:

     - instantaneously access a consumer's vehicle purchase request as soon as
       the consumer submits it online,

     - consolidate Internet leads from multiple sources and showroom traffic in
       a single application,

     - track all interaction with the consumer,

     - accelerate dealer response time to consumers' online vehicle purchase
       requests,

     - send e-mail to consumers using a variety of predetermined templates,

     - access purchase requests through web-enabled cellular phones and wireless
       handheld devices,

     - input new and used vehicle inventory information for immediate display to
       consumers on Autobytel Web pages,

     - track dealership performance through a series of reports available
       online,

     - access Autobytel "news" and product information online, and

     - contact Autobytel technical support personnel via e-mail links.

     CarSmart dealers use the SmarTrack dealer system. Autobytel is currently
evaluating whether to standardize all of its dealers on a single system.

INTERNATIONAL ACTIVITIES

     Autobytel has established and intends to further expand its presence in
foreign markets through licensing agreements and by establishing relationships
with vehicle dealers and strategic investors located in foreign markets.

     Europe. Autobytel established Autobytel.Europe with strategic investors to
expand its operations in Europe. Autobytel licensed its technology, business
processes and trade name to Autobytel.Europe on a royalty free perpetual basis
and contributed to Autobytel.Europe its existing license agreements for the
United Kingdom and Scandinavia and Finland. Autobytel.Europe intends to license
such technology, business processes and trade name to national operating
companies in European countries. Autobytel.Europe will generally invest in such
national operating companies or obtain options to acquire equity positions in
such companies. Autobytel.Europe also intends to offer joint services to such
companies to localize the Autobytel offerings while building its brand name
among consumers in individual countries as well as on a Pan-European and
regional basis. The strategic investors in Autobytel.Europe are GE Capital
Equity Holdings, Inc., Inchcape plc, the United Kingdom's largest independent
importer and distributor of motor vehicles, Pon Holdings B.V., a major
distributor of vehicles in The Netherlands, e-LaSer, a leader in customer
services and e-commerce in Europe and a subsidiary of Galeries Lafayette Group
and Continental AG, a major tire manufacturer. As of March 31, 2001, Autobytel
owned 77% of Autobytel.Europe.

     The license agreement with Auto-by-Tel UK limited, a subsidiary of Inchcape
plc, is a 20-year exclusive agreement to license Autobytel's technology,
business processes and trade name in the United Kingdom, as well as provide
maintenance and development for such technology. The license agreement with
Auto-By-Tel AB is a similar 10-year exclusive agreement for Sweden. The United
Kingdom and Swedish sites were launched in April 1999. As of March 31, 2001,
Autobytel.Europe owned 15% of Auto-By-Tel AB. Autobytel.Europe entered into
10-year exclusive license agreements for The Netherlands and Spain. The
Netherlands and Spanish sites were launched in February 2001. Autobytel.Europe
intends to establish licensing agreements in Germany, France and Italy as well
as other countries in Western and Eastern Europe.

     Japan. In June 1999 Autobytel established Autobytel Japan Kabushiki Kaisha
with six Japanese investors. Autobytel entered into a 10-year exclusive
agreement with Autobytel Japan to license its technology, business processes and
trade name in Japan. The strategic investors in Autobytel Japan are ITOCHU
Corporation, a global trading company with approximately $110 billion in
revenue; Intec, Inc., a leading independent systems integrator and network
service provider with its own infrastructure in Japan; e-solutions, inc., an
e-commerce solutions provider from business plan to implementation; Recruit Co.,
Ltd., the publisher of Japan's most widely recognized auto-related magazine;
Orient Corporation, a leading consumer finance company in Japan; and
TransCosmos, a leading network services company in Japan. GE Capital is also an
investor in Autobytel Japan. Autobytel Japan launched its Web site in November
1999. As of March 31, 2001, Autobytel owned 26% of Autobytel Japan.

     Australia. In February 2000 Autobytel established autobytel Australia Pty
Limited with six Australian investors. Autobytel entered into a 10-year
exclusive agreement with Autobytel Australia to license its technology, business
processes and trade name in Australia as well as to localize the Autobytel
offerings for the Australian market. The strategic investors in Australia are
St. George Bank Limited, one of Australia's largest banks with over 20 years
experience in the automotive finance industry; Trading Post, Australia's largest
print and online used car market; Astre Automotive, Australia's largest vehicle
distributor and importer; RACV (Royal Automobile Club of Victoria), with
approximately 1.3 million

members; Fortis Insurance, one of Australia's largest automotive insurance
companies; and Strathfield E-Ventures, a technology based company specializing
in e-commerce sales of auto accessories with extensive automotive e-commerce
knowledge. Autobytel Australia launched its Web site in October 2000. As of
March 31, 2001, Autobytel owned 30% of Autobytel Australia.

     Canada. Through Autobytel's wholly-owned subsidiary, Autobytel.ca inc.,
Autobytel launched Autobytel.ca in Canada in 1998. As of March 31, 2001,
approximately 200 Canadian dealerships belonged to Autobytel's network.

     Expansion Opportunities. Autobytel is currently exploring additional
opportunities in Europe, Asia and Latin America.

     Revenues from Autobytel's customers outside of the United States were less
than 10% of total revenues for the years ended December 31, 2000 and December
31, 1999.

MARKETING AND SALES

     Autobytel's ability to enhance the recognition of its brand names,
domestically and internationally, and position itself as a leading
Internet-based vehicle information and automotive services provider is important
to its efforts to increase the number of vehicle purchase requests and requests
for ancillary services, as well as the number and quality of subscribing
dealerships. Over the past several years, Autobytel has been the subject of
numerous newspaper, magazine, radio and television stories. Articles about its
new vehicle program have appeared in Business Week, Fortune, Forbes, Time, and
The Wall Street Journal, among other publications. Television stories featuring
Autobytel have been aired nationally on all major television networks. Autobytel
believes that ongoing media coverage is an important element in creating
consumer awareness of its brand names and has contributed to dealership
awareness of, and participation in, Autobytel's programs.

     Autobytel has established marketing and advertising programs with many of
the leading automotive information providers on the Internet, including
Edmund's, IntelliChoice and Kelley Blue Book which direct traffic to its Web
site and increase purchase requests. Autobytel's agreements with automotive
information providers typically have a term of one year.

     In the first quarter of 2001 and the year 2000, approximately 33% and 17%
of Autobytel's total purchase requests originated from StoneAge Corporation,
respectively. Autobytel's agreement with StoneAge, pursuant to which it receives
referrals from StoneAge's Web site, is scheduled to expire in March 2002.
StoneAge provides Autobytel with the largest number of purchase requests other
than consumers visiting the Autobytel Web site directly. Autobytel pays StoneAge
based on a per purchase request basis.

     Autobytel's agreement with NBC Internet provides for anchor tenancy in the
New Car Center on its Web site, NBCi.com, as well as other promotions on its Web
site. The agreement also provides for a co-branded Web site. The agreement is
for a term of three years expiring in March 2002. Autobytel pays NBCi annual and
monthly fees.

     As of March 31, 2001, the aggregate minimum future payments under
Autobytel's agreements with Internet portals was $10.5 million.

     During the first quarter of 2001 and the year 2000, Autobytel's total
Internet marketing and advertising costs incurred were $6.2 million and $20.6
million, respectively. Annual, monthly and variable fees were $0.2 million, $1.5
million, and $4.5 million, respectively, in the first quarter of 2001 and $0.6
million, $7.5 million and $12.0 million, respectively, in the year 2000. Setup
and initial fees in the year 2000 were $0.5 million.

     Autobytel supplements its Internet presence with television, radio and
print advertising. In late 1996, Autobytel began to broaden its marketing
efforts with a campaign to accelerate consumer awareness of the Autobytel brand
name and drive traffic to its Web site through cable television advertisements
featured on

CNN and CNET, Inc. and network television advertisements featured on NBC and
MSNBC. Autobytel expects to continue to use television advertising to strengthen
its brand awareness.

     In addition to Autobytel's consumer-oriented marketing activities, it also
markets its programs directly to dealerships, participates in trade shows,
advertises in trade publications and major automotive magazines and encourages
subscribing dealerships to recommend its program to other dealerships.

INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY

     Autobytel has registered service marks, including "Auto-By-Tel",
"Autobytel.com" and its "Autobytel.com logo" and has applied for additional
service marks and numerous patents. Autobytel regards its trademarks, service
marks and brand names as important to its business.

DEALER RELATIONSHIPS AND SERVICES

     Dealer Network. Dealers participate in Autobytel's networks by entering
into contracts with Autobytel. Autobytel is converting its dealers to new
contracts with one-year terms that are terminable on 30 days' notice by either
party. Autobytel's dealerships are located in most major metropolitan areas in
the United States and Canada. As of March 31, 2001, the Autobytel participating
dealership base totaled approximately 3,500 dealers. Dealerships pay initiation
and monthly fees to subscribe to Autobytel's online marketing program. Both the
initial and monthly subscription fees are established in the contract and are
based upon many business factors including the type and location of the
franchise. Autobytel reserves the right to raise its fees to dealers upon 30
days notice after the first six months of the term. Autobytel does not prevent
dealers from entering into agreements with its competitors.

     CarSmart's dealer agreements are generally for a term of three years and
are terminable on 30 days' notice by CarSmart. As of March 31, 2001, the
CarSmart participating dealership base totaled approximately 1,200 dealers.
CarSmart's dealers pay initial, annual and monthly subscription fees. CarSmart
reserves the right to revise fees after six months. CarSmart is converting its
dealers to new contracts with one year terms and no annual fees.

     As of March 31, 2001, dealers that participated in both the Autobytel and
CarSmart new vehicle purchasing services totaled approximately 400.

     Customer Support. Autobytel actively monitors subscribing dealers through
ongoing customer surveys, and research conducted by its internal dealer support
group. Generally, within 14 days after a consumer submits a purchase request
through one of Autobytel's Web sites, Autobytel re-contacts the consumer by
e-mail requesting completion of a quality assurance survey that allows Autobytel
to evaluate the sales process at participating dealers. Additionally, Autobytel
performs telephone surveys of its customers to further support the information
gained from the written quality assurance surveys. Dealerships that fail to
abide by Autobytel's program guidelines or who generate repeated consumer
complaints are reviewed and, if appropriate, terminated. In return for requiring
a high level of consumer service, Autobytel assigns participating dealerships
exclusive territories. Autobytel tries to assign dealers attractive territories
in order to increase participation in its program.

     Each dealer agreement obligates the dealers to adhere to Autobytel's policy
of providing prompt responses to customers, no haggle pricing and full
disclosure regarding vehicle availability, add-ons and related matters.
Autobytel requires each dealer to have a manager whose principal responsibility
is supervising its system, similar to the way in which most dealers have a new
vehicle sales manager, pre-owned vehicle sales manager and service and parts
department managers who are responsible for those dealership functions.
Autobytel reserves the right to reduce or modify each dealer's assigned
territory after the first six months, although there can be no assurance that a
dealer whose territory is reduced or modified will not contest such a change or
terminate its subscription. Autobytel cannot be sure that dealers whose
territories are reduced or modified by it will not pursue legal action against
it in an effort to prevent the change or recover damages.

     Training. Autobytel believes that dealers and their employees require
specialized training to learn the skills necessary to serve the Internet user
and take full advantage of Autobytel's proprietary systems. Therefore, Autobytel
has developed an extensive training program for its dealers. Autobytel believes
that this training is critical to enhancing its brand and reputation. Autobytel
requires participating dealerships to have their representatives trained on its
system. Training is conducted at Autobytel's headquarters in Irvine, California,
at regional training centers and at dealerships' premises. In training its
dealers, Autobytel de-emphasizes traditional vehicle selling techniques and
emphasizes the Autobytel approach. To increase consumer satisfaction and reduce
costs, Autobytel seeks to discourage dealerships from using commissioned and
multiple salespersons to interface with its customers. In October 1999,
Autobytel formed I-Net Training Technologies LLC with third parties to provide
dealers with more extensive training and tools to facilitate Internet selling of
vehicles. Such services are provided for a fee.

COMPETITION

     Autobytel believes that the principal competitive factors affecting the
market for Internet-based vehicle marketing services include:

     - brand name recognition,

     - speed and quality of fulfillment,

     - variety of related products and services,

     - ease of use,

     - customer satisfaction,

     - quality of service, and

     - technical expertise.

     Autobytel's vehicle purchasing services compete against a variety of
Internet and traditional vehicle buying services, automotive brokers and
classifieds. Many of such competitors are substantially better financed than
Autobytel is. In the Internet-based market, Autobytel competes with other
entities which maintain similar commercial Web sites including AutoVantage,
Microsoft Corporation's CarPoint, CarsDirect.com, Cars.com and AutoTrader.com.
AutoNation, a large consolidator of dealers, has a Web site for marketing
vehicles. Autobytel also competes indirectly against vehicle brokerage firms and
affinity programs offered by several companies, including Costco Wholesale
Corporation and Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. In addition, all major vehicle
manufacturers have their own Web sites and many have launched online buying
services, such as General Motors Corporation's BuyPower and Ford Motor Company's
FordDirect.com.

     Autobytel also competes with vehicle insurers, lenders and lessors as well
as individual dealerships. Such companies may already maintain or may introduce
Web sites which compete with Autobytel's. Autobytel cannot assure that it can
compete successfully against current or future competitors, many of which have
substantially more capital, resources and access to additional financing than it
does, nor can there be any assurance that competitive pressures faced by
Autobytel will not result in increased marketing costs, decreased Web site
traffic or loss of market share or otherwise will not materially and adversely
affect its business, results of operations and financial condition. Autobytel
competes primarily on brand name recognition acquired through early entry into
the Internet-based automotive purchase referral market and through customer and
dealer satisfaction.

OPERATIONS AND TECHNOLOGY

     Autobytel believes that its future success is significantly dependent upon
its ability to continue to deliver high-performance and reliable Web sites,
enhance consumer/dealer communications, maintain the highest levels of
information privacy and ensure transactional security. Autobytel currently hosts
its Web site at its data center. Its data center includes redundant
infrastructure and network connections and is

located at Autobytel's headquarters in Irvine, California. In the future,
Autobytel may host its infrastructure at a leading Application Service Provider.
Autobytel's network and computer systems are built on the leading industry
standards. Network security is provided by utilizing standard products.
CarSmart's site is hosted by a third party.

     System enhancements are primarily intended to accommodate increased traffic
across Autobytel's Web sites, improve the speed in which purchase requests are
processed and introduce new and enhanced products and services. System
enhancements entail the implementation of sophisticated new technology and
system processes.

GOVERNMENT REGULATION

     Currently few laws or regulations have been adopted that apply directly to
Internet business activities. The adoption of additional local, state, national
or international laws or regulations may decrease the growth of Internet usage
or the acceptance of Internet commerce.

     Autobytel believes that its dealer marketing services do not constitute
franchising or vehicle brokerage activity in a way that makes franchise, motor
vehicle dealer, or vehicle broker licensing laws applicable to Autobytel.
Through a subsidiary, Autobytel is licensed as a motor vehicle dealer and
broker. However, if individual state regulatory requirements change or
additional requirements are imposed on Autobytel, it may be required to modify
its service programs in such a state in a manner which may undermine its
program's attractiveness to consumers or dealers or not offer such service or
terminate its operations in such a state. As Autobytel introduces new services,
it may need to comply with additional licensing regulations and regulatory
requirements.

     Autobytel's services may result in changes in the way vehicles are
currently sold or may be viewed as threatening by new and pre-owned vehicle
dealers who do not subscribe to its programs. Such businesses are often
represented by influential lobbying organizations, and such organizations or
other persons may propose legislation that, if adopted, could impact Autobytel's
evolving marketing and distribution model.

     Other countries to which Autobytel expands its operations may have laws or
be subject to treaties that regulate the marketing, distribution, and sale of
vehicles. As Autobytel considers specific foreign operations, it will need to
determine whether the laws of the countries in which it seeks to operate require
it to modify its program or otherwise change the Autobytel system or prohibit
the use of the system in such country entirely. In addition, the laws of a
foreign country may impose licensing, bonding or similar requirements on
Autobytel as a condition to doing business there.

     To date, Autobytel has not expended significant resources on lobbying or
related government affairs issues but may be required to do so in the future.

     Franchise Classification. If Autobytel's relationship or written agreement
with its dealers was found to be a "franchise" under federal or state franchise
laws, Autobytel could be subjected to additional regulations, including but not
limited to licensing, increased reporting and disclosure requirements.
Compliance with varied laws, regulations, and enforcement characteristics found
in each state may require Autobytel to allocate both staff time and monetary
resources, each of which may have an adverse affect on its results of
operations. As an additional risk, if Autobytel's dealer relationship or
subscription agreement is determined to establish a franchise, Autobytel may be
subject to limitations on its ability to quickly and efficiently effect changes
in its dealer relationships in response to changing market trends, which may
negatively impact its ability to compete in the marketplace.

     Autobytel believes that neither its relationship with its subscribing
dealers nor its dealer subscription agreements themselves constitute
"franchises" under federal or state franchise laws. This belief has been upheld
by a Federal Appeals Court in Michigan that ruled Autobytel's business
relationship and its dealer subscription agreement does not rise to the level of
a "franchise" under Michigan law.

     Vehicle Brokerage Activities. Autobytel believes that state motor vehicles
dealer or broker licensing laws do not apply to it. Through a wholly-owned
subsidiary, Autobytel is licensed as a motor vehicle dealer

and broker. Autobytel may be required to pay administrative fees, fines, and
penalties for failure to comply with such licensing requirements. Autobytel
believes that its dealer marketing referral service model does not qualify as an
automobile brokerage activity.

     In response to concerns about its marketing referral program raised by the
Texas Department of Transportation, Autobytel modified its program in that state
to achieve compliance. These modifications included a unique pricing model under
which all subscribing dealerships in Texas are charged uniform fees based on the
population density of their particular geographic area and opening its program
to all dealerships who wish to apply.

     In the event that any other state's regulatory requirements impose state
specific requirements on Autobytel or include Autobytel within an
industry-specific regulatory scheme, Autobytel may be required to modify its
marketing programs in such states in a manner which may undermine the program's
attractiveness to consumers or dealers. In the alternative, if Autobytel
determines that the licensing and related requirements are overly burdensome,
Autobytel may elect to terminate operations in such state. In each case,
Autobytel's business, results of operations and financial condition could be
materially and adversely affected.

     Financing Related Activities. Autobytel provides a connection through its
Web sites that allows a consumer to obtain finance information and loan
approval. Autobytel does not demand nor does it receive any fees from consumers
for this service. In the event states require Autobytel to be licensed as a
financial broker, Autobytel intends to obtain such licenses. Autobytel may be
unable to comply with a state's regulations affecting its current operations or
newly introduced services, or it could be required to incur significant fees and
expenses to license or be compelled to discontinue finance operations in those
states.

     Insurance Related Activities. Autobytel provides a link on its Web sites so
consumers can receive real time quotes for insurance coverage from Channelpoint
Corporation and submit quote applications online. Participants in the program
include The Hartford (Hartford Financial Services Group, Inc.), The GE Auto
Insurance Program and Ekemper. Autobytel typically receives a marketing fee for
every quote application sent to a participating insurance company or agent by a
consumer accessing the Channelpoint Web site through Autobytel's Web sites.
Autobytel receives no premiums from consumers nor does it charge consumers fees
for its services. All applications are completed on Channelpoint's Web site.

     Autobytel does not believe that its activity requires it to be licensed
under state insurance laws. The use of the Internet in the marketing of
insurance products, however, is a relatively new practice. It is not clear
whether or to what extent state insurance licensing laws apply to activities
similar to Autobytel's. Given this uncertainty, Autobytel has proactively
applied for and currently holds, through a wholly-owned subsidiary, insurance
agent licenses or is otherwise authorized to transact insurance in 47 states and
the District of Columbia.

EMPLOYEES

     As of April 30, 2001, Autobytel had a total of 250 employees, including 12
employees of CarSmart and 25 employees of Autobytel.Europe. Autobytel also
utilizes independent contractors as required. None of Autobytel's employees are
represented by a labor union. Autobytel has not experienced any work stoppages
and considers its employee relations to be good.

PROPERTIES

     Autobytel's headquarters are located in a single office building in Irvine,
California. Autobytel occupies four floors, for a total of approximately 49,000
square feet. Each floor is leased with expiration dates ranging from September
2001 through February 2002. CarSmart's operations occupy approximately 2,700
square feet in a single office building in San Ramon, California. The lease for
this office space expires in March 2003. Autobytel.Europe is located in a single
office building in The Netherlands and occupies approximately 1,800 square
meters. The lease expires in August 2005.

LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

     A.I.N. was sued on September 1, 1999 in a lawsuit entitled Robert Martins
v. Michael J. Gorun, A.I.N., Inc., et al., in Los Angeles Superior Court. The
complaint contains causes of action for breach of written and oral contracts,
promissory estoppel, breach of fiduciary duty and fraud, and seeks damages and
equitable relief. The plaintiff contends he is entitled to a 49.9% ownership
interest in A.I.N.'s CarSmart online business based on a purported agreement for
the formation of a company called CarSmart On-Line Services. On December 14,
1999, A.I.N. filed a complaint for declaratory relief on the subject of Mr.
Martins' lawsuit in Contra Costa County Superior Court. The Los Angeles action
has been transferred to Contra Costa County and the two cases have been
consolidated. Autobytel was added as a cross defendant in such action. The
lawsuit is and will be vigorously contested on behalf of Autobytel and A.I.N.

     The selling stockholders of A.I.N. are obligated to fully indemnify
Autobytel for all losses, including attorney's fees, expenses, settlements and
judgments, arising out of the lawsuit. The indemnification obligation was
initially secured by 450,000 shares of Autobytel common stock transferred to the
selling stockholders as part of the acquisition of A.I.N., as well as $250,000
in cash. As of April 30, 2001, the obligation was secured by the 373,068 shares
of common stock and $126,000 in cash after expenses.

     On July 15, 1998, Autobytel and certain of its past and current officers
were sued by former employee Thomas Heshion in a lawsuit entitled Thomas
Heshion, et al. v. Auto-By-Tel Corporation, et al. in Orange County Superior
Court. Plaintiff claimed that he was wrongfully terminated and that Autobytel
and its officers interfered with an oral agreement between plaintiff and another
co-worker for the purchase of the co-worker's Autobytel stock. Summary judgment
was granted on the claims alleging interference with the alleged stock
agreement. The remaining claims for wrongful termination were tried to a jury
which returned a verdict in December 2000 in favor of plaintiff in the amount of
$1.9 million.

     Autobytel believes the judgement is in error and has retained new counsel
to handle the post-trial motions and, if necessary, the appeal. Autobytel
intends to vigorously contest the judgment.

     From time to time, Autobytel is involved in other litigation matters
relating to claims arising out of the ordinary course of business. Autobytel is
involved in at least one such case currently. Autobytel believes that there are
no claims or actions pending or threatened against it, the ultimate disposition
of which would have a material adverse effect on its business, results of
operations and financial condition. However, if a court or jury rules against
Autobytel and the ruling is ultimately sustained on appeal and damages are
awarded against Autobytel, such ruling could have a material and adverse effect
on its business, results of operations and financial condition.
