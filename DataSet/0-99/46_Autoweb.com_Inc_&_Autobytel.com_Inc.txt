(1) This registration statement relates to the common stock, par value $0.001
    per share, of Registrant issuable to holders of common stock, par value
    $0.001, of Autoweb.com, Inc., in the proposed merger of Autobytel
    Acquisition I Corp., a Delaware corporation and wholly-owned subsidiary of
    Registrant, with and into Autoweb.com, Inc., a Delaware corporation. The
    amount of Registrant's common stock to be registered has been determined by
    multiplying the exchange ratio (0.3553 shares of Registrant's common stock
    for each share of Autoweb.com, Inc. common stock) by the maximum aggregate
    number of shares of Registrant that Registrant may be required to issue in
    connection with the proposed merger (calculated as 34,234,983 which is the
    sum of (a) 29,526,453 outstanding shares of Autoweb.com, Inc. common stock
    and (b) 4,708,530 shares of Autoweb.com, Inc. common stock issuable upon the
    exercise of outstanding options, whether or not exercised before
    consummation of the merger).

(2) Estimated solely for the purpose of calculating the registration fee
    pursuant to Rule 457(c) and (f) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended,
    based on the market value of Autoweb.com, Inc.'s common stock to be
    exchanged in the merger, as the product of (a) the average of the high and
    low sale prices of Autoweb.com, Inc.'s common stock on the Nasdaq National
    Market on May 4, 2001 and (b) the maximum number of shares of Registrant's
    common stock that may be exchanged in the merger, calculated as described in
    the foregoing footnote.

    THE REGISTRANT HEREBY AMENDS THIS REGISTRATION STATEMENT ON SUCH DATE OR
DATES AS MAY BE NECESSARY TO DELAY ITS EFFECTIVE DATE UNTIL THE REGISTRANT SHALL
FILE A FURTHER AMENDMENT WHICH SPECIFICALLY STATES THAT THIS REGISTRATION
STATEMENT SHALL THEREAFTER BECOME EFFECTIVE IN ACCORDANCE WITH SECTION 8(a) OF
THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933 OR UNTIL THE REGISTRATION STATEMENT SHALL BECOME
EFFECTIVE ON SUCH DATE AS THE COMMISSION, ACTING PURSUANT TO SAID SECTION 8(a),

Q: WHAT DO I NEED TO DO NOW? (SEE PAGES   AND   )

A: Mail your signed proxy card in the enclosed return envelope as soon as
   possible so that your shares may be represented at your meeting.

   If you do not include instructions on how to vote your properly signed proxy
   card, your common stock will be voted "FOR" approval of matters related to
   the merger, "FOR" each of the proposals set forth

   in this joint proxy statement/prospectus to be considered at either company's
   annual meeting and, if any other matters are properly brought before either
   annual meeting, the persons named in the respective proxies will have
   discretion to vote on such matters.

Q: AS AN AUTOWEB STOCKHOLDER, SHOULD I SEND IN MY AUTOWEB STOCK CERTIFICATES
   WITH MY PROXY CARD? (SEE PAGE   )

A: No. After the merger is completed, Autobytel will send you written

   stock certificates.

   SHARES FOR ME? (SEE PAGES   ,   )

A: Brokers cannot vote your shares with respect to the merger without
   instructions from you on how to vote. Therefore, it is important that you
   follow the directions provided by your broker regarding how to instruct your
   broker to vote your shares. If you are an Autoweb stockholder, and you fail

                SUMMARY OF THE JOINT PROXY STATEMENT/PROSPECTUS

     This joint proxy statement/prospectus pertains to the merger of a
wholly-owned subsidiary of Autobytel with and into Autoweb and other annual
meeting proposals for the annual meetings of Autoweb and Autobytel. This joint
proxy statement/prospectus is being sent to the holders of Autoweb common stock
and holders of Autobytel common stock.

     This summary may not contain all of the information that is important to
you. You should read carefully this entire document, including the acquisition
agreement and other documents attached to this joint proxy statement/prospectus
and the other documents referenced in it for a more complete understanding of
the merger. In particular, you should read the acquisition agreement, a
composite conformed copy of which is attached as Annex A, the opinion of Lehman
Brothers, which is attached as Annex B and the opinion of Credit Suisse First
Boston, which is attached as Annex C.

THE MERGER (SEE PAGE   )

     Autobytel and Autoweb are merging because they believe the resulting
combination will create a stronger, more competitive company capable of
achieving greater financial strength, operational efficiencies and growth
potential than either company would have on its own.

     In the merger, Autoweb will merge with a wholly-owned subsidiary of
Autobytel. Upon consummation of the merger, Autoweb will become a wholly-owned
subsidiary of Autobytel. Autoweb common stockholders will receive, in exchange
for each share of Autoweb common stock they hold, 0.3553 shares of Autobytel
common stock. No fraction of a share of Autobytel common stock will be issued,
but instead each holder of shares of Autoweb common stock who would otherwise be
entitled to a fraction of a share of Autobytel common stock shall receive an
amount of cash (rounded to the nearest whole cent) equal to the product of such
fraction multiplied by the average closing price of Autobytel common stock for
the fifteen trading days immediately preceding the closing date of the proposed
merger, as reported on the Nasdaq National Market. The number of shares of
Autobytel common stock awardable (after aggregating all fractional shares of
Autobytel common stock) shall be rounded down to the nearest whole share of
Autobytel common stock. After the merger, the current stockholders of Autobytel
will own approximately 66% of Autobytel and the former stockholders of Autoweb
will own approximately 34% of Autobytel.

     At the effective time of the merger, Autobytel will assume each outstanding
option issued under Autoweb's 1997 Stock Option Plan, 1999 Equity Incentive
Plan, 1999 Employee Stock Purchase Plan, and 1999 Directors Stock Option Plan,
whether vested or unvested, to purchase shares of Autoweb common stock on
substantially the same terms and conditions as were applicable prior to the
effective time of the merger, except that (1) the options will be exercisable
for shares of Autobytel common stock, and (2) the number of shares of Autobytel
common stock which may be purchased will be equal to the number of shares of
Autoweb common stock underlying the option multiplied by 0.3553. Any fractional
share of Autobytel common stock resulting from such adjustment will be rounded
down to the nearest whole number. The exercise price per share of Autobytel
common stock issuable under each Autoweb option will equal the per share
exercise price of the Autoweb common stock purchasable under the Autoweb option
divided by 0.3553. The exercise price will be rounded up to the nearest whole
cent.

     Within thirty days after the effective time, Autobytel will issue to each
person who immediately prior to the effective time was a holder of an assumed
option, an option document evidencing the foregoing assumption of such option by
Autobytel.

     Autobytel and Autoweb are working toward completing the merger as quickly
as possible. They hope to complete the merger late in the second calendar
quarter or early in the third calendar quarter of 2001.

     A composite conformed copy of the acquisition agreement is attached to this
joint proxy statement/ prospectus as Annex A. You are encouraged to read it
carefully. In evaluating the merger, you should also carefully consider the
factors discussed in the section entitled "Risk Factors" on page 8.

statement/prospectus as "Autoweb."

ANNUAL MEETING OF STOCKHOLDERS (SEE PAGES   )

     Autobytel will hold an annual meeting of its stockholders on          ,
2001. At the meeting, Autobytel stockholders will consider and vote on a
proposal to approve the issuance of Autobytel common stock to the stockholders
of Autoweb and will also vote to elect three directors, to ratify Autobytel's
independent public accountants for fiscal 2001 and to approve an amendment to
Autobytel's Certificate of Incorporation changing the name of Autobytel to
Autobytel Inc.

     Autoweb will hold an annual meeting of its stockholders on          , 2001.
At the meeting, Autoweb stockholders will consider and vote on a proposal to
approve and adopt the acquisition agreement and the merger and will also vote to
elect two directors and to ratify Autoweb's independent public accountants for
fiscal 2001.

     Autobytel stockholders and Autoweb stockholders need to send in their
signed proxy card in the enclosed return envelope as soon as possible so that
their shares may be represented at the annual meetings discussed above. If
Autobytel stockholders and Autoweb stockholders do not include instructions on
how to vote their properly signed proxy card, their common stock will be voted
"FOR" approval of matters related to the merger, "FOR" each of the other
proposals discussed in this joint proxy

statement/prospectus and, if any other matters are properly brought before
either annual meeting, the persons named in the respective proxy cards will have
discretion to vote on such matters.

     Brokers cannot vote Autobytel stockholders' or Autoweb stockholders' shares
with respect to the merger without instructions from them on how to vote.
Therefore, it is important that Autobytel stockholders and Autoweb stockholders
follow the directions provided by their brokers regarding how to instruct their
broker to vote their shares. If Autoweb stockholders fail to provide their
brokers with instructions, it will have the same effect as a vote against the
acquisition agreement and the merger.

     If an Autobytel stockholder or an Autoweb stockholder wants to change their
vote, they should send the secretary of Autobytel or Autoweb, as applicable, a
later-dated, signed proxy card before the meeting or attend the meeting in
person. A proxy card may be revoked by sending written notice to the applicable
secretary before the meeting.

     After the merger is completed, Autoweb stockholders will receive written
instructions for exchanging their Autoweb stock certificates for Autobytel stock
certificates and Autoweb optionholders will receive new Autobytel option
agreements.

RECOMMENDATION OF AUTOBYTEL'S BOARD OF DIRECTORS (SEE PAGE   )

     After careful consideration, Autobytel's board of directors unanimously
recommends that its stockholders vote for the issuance of Autobytel's common
stock in the merger, for election of its nominees for Class III director, for
the ratification of its independent public accountants for fiscal 2001 and for
amending Autobytel's Certificate of Incorporation to change its name to
Autobytel Inc. Autobytel's board of directors has unanimously voted to approve
the acquisition agreement, the proposed merger and the issuance of Autobytel
common stock in the merger.

RECOMMENDATION OF AUTOWEB'S BOARD OF DIRECTORS (SEE PAGE   )

     After careful consideration, Autoweb's board of directors unanimously
recommends that its stockholders vote for approval of the acquisition agreement
and the proposed merger, for election of its nominees for Class II director and
for the ratification of its independent public accountants for fiscal 2001.
Autoweb's board of directors has unanimously voted to approve the acquisition
agreement and the proposed merger. Autoweb stockholders holding shares totaling
approximately 30% of the outstanding common stock of Autoweb have agreed to vote
all of their shares in favor of the merger.

CONDITIONS TO COMPLETION OF THE MERGER (SEE PAGE   )

     The completion of the merger depends on meeting a number of conditions.

VOTE REQUIRED FOR APPROVAL (SEE PAGE   )

     The holders of a majority of the shares of Autobytel common stock present

issuance of Autobytel common stock in the merger.

     The holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of Autoweb common stock
on the record date set for Autoweb's annual meeting must approve the acquisition

outstanding common stock as of the record date have agreed to vote all their
shares in favor of the acquisition agreement and the merger.

TERMINATION OF THE ACQUISITION AGREEMENT (SEE PAGE   )

     Autobytel and Autoweb each have the right to terminate the acquisition
agreement under certain circumstances. In certain cases, termination of the
acquisition agreement will require payment of a termination fee and/or expenses
by Autoweb or the payment of expenses by Autobytel.

DIRECTORS AND EXECUTIVE OFFICERS OF AUTOBYTEL AND THE COMBINED COMPANY FOLLOWING
THE MERGER
(SEE PAGES   )

     Following the merger, the board of directors of Autobytel will consist of
the then current members of Autobytel's board of directors plus Jeffrey A.
Schwartz and Mark R. Ross.

     Following the merger, Mark Lorimer, the current President and Chief
Executive Officer of Autobytel, will continue to be President and Chief
Executive Officer of Autobytel.

     Following the merger, the board of directors of Autoweb, which will then be

Acquisition I Corp.'s board of directors.

     Following the merger, Jeffrey Schwartz, the current President and Chief
Executive Officer of Autoweb, will be the Vice Chairman of Autobytel.

OPINIONS OF AUTOBYTEL'S AND AUTOWEB'S FINANCIAL ADVISORS (SEE PAGES   AND   )

     In connection with the merger, Autobytel's board of directors considered
the opinion it received from its financial advisor, Lehman Brothers, as to the
fairness, from a financial point of view, to Autobytel, of the 0.3553 exchange
ratio provided for in the acquisition agreement. Autoweb's board of directors
considered the opinion it received from its financial advisor, Credit Suisse
First Boston, as to the fairness, from a financial point of view, as of March
31, 2001, to the holders of Autoweb common stock, of the 0.3553 exchange ratio
provided for in the acquisition agreement. The full text of the written opinions
of the financial advisors are attached to this document as Annex B and Annex C,
and should be read carefully in their entirety to understand the procedures
followed, the assumptions made, matters considered and limitations on the review
undertaken in providing the opinions. The opinion of Lehman Brothers is directed
to the Autobytel board of directors and the opinion of Credit Suisse First
Boston is directed to the Autoweb board of directors, and these opinions do not
address the prices at which Autobytel's common stock will trade after the
proposed merger and do not constitute a recommendation to any stockholder as to
how to vote with respect to any matter relating to the proposed merger.

UNITED STATES FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSEQUENCES OF THE MERGER (SEE PAGE   )

     We have structured the merger so that, in general, Autobytel, Autobytel's
stockholders, Autoweb and Autoweb's stockholders will not recognize gain or loss
for United States federal income tax purposes as a result of the merger, except
that Autoweb stockholders will recognize a gain or loss resulting from the
receipt of cash instead of fractional shares of Autobytel common stock.

     It is a condition to the merger that both Autobytel and Autoweb receive
legal opinions to the effect that the merger will constitute a "reorganization"
within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code.

     All stockholders are urged to consult their own tax advisors to determine
their particular tax consequences.

ACCOUNTING TREATMENT OF THE MERGER (SEE PAGE   )

     Autobytel intends to account for the merger as a "purchase" for financial
accounting purposes, in accordance with United States generally accepted
accounting principles.

INTERESTS OF CERTAIN PERSONS IN THE MERGER (SEE PAGE   )

     When considering the recommendations of Autoweb's board of directors, you
should be aware that certain Autoweb directors, officers and stockholders have
interests in the merger that are different from, or are in addition to, yours.
These interests include the assumption of options, accelerated vesting of
options, the employment of certain Autoweb executive officers by Autobytel after
the merger, possible severance payments and the indemnification of directors and
officers of Autoweb against certain liabilities both before and after the
merger.

DISSENTERS' RIGHTS (SEE PAGE   )

     Under Delaware law, Autobytel stockholders and Autoweb stockholders are not
entitled to dissenters' rights in connection with the merger.

RESTRICTIONS ON THE ABILITY TO SELL AUTOBYTEL STOCK (SEE PAGE   )

     All Autobytel common stock received by Autoweb stockholders in connection
with the merger will be freely transferable unless the holder is considered an
affiliate of either Autoweb or Autobytel under the Securities Act of 1933, as
amended. Shares of Autobytel held by affiliates may only be sold pursuant to a
registration statement or an exemption from the registration requirements of the
Securities Act.

                                  RISK FACTORS

     The merger involves a high degree of risk. By voting in favor of the
merger, current Autoweb stockholders will be choosing to invest in Autobytel
common stock, and current Autobytel stockholders will face dilution of their
ownership interest in Autobytel. An investment in Autobytel common stock
involves a high degree of risk. In addition to the other information contained
in this joint proxy statement/prospectus, you should carefully consider all of
the following risk factors relating to the proposed merger, the combined
company, Autobytel and Autoweb, in deciding whether to vote for the merger and
the related issuance of Autobytel shares.

GENERAL RISKS RELATED TO THE MERGER AND THE COMBINED COMPANIES

THE NUMBER OF AUTOBYTEL SHARES TO BE RECEIVED BY AUTOWEB STOCKHOLDERS IN THE
MERGER IS FIXED AND WILL NOT BE ADJUSTED FOR CHANGES IN THE PRICE OF AUTOBYTEL
OR AUTOWEB SHARES.

     At the closing of the merger, each share of Autoweb common stock will be
exchanged for 0.3553 shares of Autobytel common stock. This exchange ratio will
not be adjusted for changes in the market price of Autobytel common stock or
Autoweb common stock. Any reduction in Autobytel's common stock price will
result in Autoweb stockholders receiving less value in the merger at closing.
Autoweb stockholders may not know the exact value of Autobytel's common stock to
be issued to them in the merger at the time of the annual meeting of Autoweb
stockholders.

     The market price of Autobytel's common stock, like that of the shares of
many other technology and Internet companies, has been and is expected to
continue to be volatile and the value of Autobytel common stock issued in the
merger will depend on its market price at the time of the merger. For example,
since Autobytel's initial public offering on March 26, 1999, Autobytel common
stock has traded as high as $58 per share and as low as $[     ] per share.
During the past twelve months Autobytel's common stock has ranged from [     ]
to [     ]. Stockholders of Autobytel and Autoweb are urged to obtain current
market quotations for Autobytel and Autoweb common stock.

AUTOBYTEL WILL FACE SIGNIFICANT CHALLENGES IN INTEGRATING AUTOBYTEL AND AUTOWEB
AND, AS A RESULT, MAY NOT REALIZE THE EXPECTED BENEFITS OF THE MERGER.

     The merger involves the integration of two companies that have previously
operated independently. Combining the operations of Autobytel and Autoweb will
be a complex process that will require, among other things, integration of
various functional areas, such as finance, human resources and sales and
marketing groups, and coordination of development efforts. Autobytel cannot be
certain that the integration will be completed in a timely manner or that it
will achieve the anticipated benefits of the merger. Failure to adequately
manage the integration process and to coordinate the joint efforts of the two
companies after the merger may have a material adverse effect on the business of
the combined company.

INTEGRATION OF THE BUSINESSES OF AUTOBYTEL AND AUTOWEB OR ELIMINATION OF CERTAIN
FUNCTIONAL AREAS MAY NEGATIVELY AFFECT AUTOBYTEL'S OR AUTOWEB'S RELATIONSHIPS
WITH CONSUMERS, DEALERS OR INTERNET PORTALS.

     There may be significant overlap in certain of the companies' assets,
functional areas or businesses and Autobytel will be required to determine
whether to maintain or eliminate such duplication. For example, the companies
maintain independent relationships with automobile dealers and Internet portals.
The combination of the two companies and the resulting overlap of services may
result in disruption of relationships with dealers or Internet portals, any of
which may result in a reduction in the number or rate of growth of the number of
consumers for one or both of the companies or a reduction in the number or
quality of relationships with dealers or Internet portals. Any disruption in
relationships with dealers or Internet portals could negatively impact the
experiences of consumers using Autobytel's or Autoweb's services and could
reduce the number of consumers directed to the companies' Web sites, any of
which may have a material adverse effect on the combined companies' business and
revenues. Autoweb also engages in lines of business not conducted by Autobytel,
including Automotive Information Center, or AIC, a provider of data and
information technology tools and original automotive editorial content to

vehicle manufacturers, dealer groups and Web destinations. Any failure by
Autobytel to integrate or manage these business lines may result in a disruption
of Autobytel's business or operations.

AUTOBYTEL WILL INCUR SIGNIFICANT COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE MERGER WHICH COULD
NEGATIVELY AFFECT AUTOBYTEL'S FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE.

     Autobytel expects to incur significant costs and commit significant
management time integrating Autoweb's operations, technology, development
programs, products, clients and personnel. These costs may be substantial and
may include costs for:

     - integration of operations, including combining teams and processes in
       various functional areas;

     - fees and expenses of professionals and consultants involved in completing
       the integration process;

     - reorganization or closure of facilities;

     - incurring potential existing liabilities of Autoweb;

     - employee severance costs; and

     - integration of technology and products.

IF THE BENEFITS OF THE MERGER ARE NOT REALIZED OR IF THEY DO NOT MEET THE
EXPECTATIONS OF INVESTORS OR FINANCIAL OR INDUSTRY ANALYSTS, THE MARKET PRICE OF
AUTOBYTEL COMMON STOCK MAY DECLINE.

     The market price of Autobytel common stock may decline as a following the
merger if:

     - the integration of Autobytel and Autoweb is not completed in a timely and
       efficient manner;

     - Autobytel does not achieve the benefits of the merger as rapidly as, or
       to the extent, anticipated by financial or industry analysts;

     - Autobytel or Autoweb incurs liabilities that are not anticipated or are
       greater than expected by securities analysts or investors;

     - the effect of the merger on Autobytel's financial results is not
       consistent with the expectations of financial or industry analysts;

     - the combined companies are unable to obtain additional capital on
       acceptable terms when required; or

     - significant stockholders of Autobytel following the merger determine to
       dispose of their shares because the results of the merger are not
       consistent with their expectations.

AUTOWEB'S OFFICERS AND DIRECTORS HAVE CONFLICTS OF INTEREST THAT MAY INFLUENCE
THEM TO SUPPORT OR APPROVE THE MERGER.

     The directors and officers of Autoweb participate in arrangements and have
continuing indemnification against liabilities that provide them with interests
in the merger that are different from, or in addition to, those of other Autoweb
stockholders, including the following:

          As of March 31, 2001, the executive officers and directors of Autoweb
     owned options to purchase an aggregate of approximately 2.8 million shares
     of Autoweb common stock, of which approximately 1.6 million are unvested or
     subject to a right of Autoweb to repurchase the shares. If the merger were
     completed, as of the above date, approximately 1.2 million of the unvested
     options will accelerate and become immediately exercisable under their
     existing terms. If the merger were completed and all officers are
     terminated other than for cause in the 12 months following such date, then
     approximately

     an additional 406,000 of the unvested options would accelerate and become
     immediately exercisable under their existing terms;

        - certain officers of Autoweb are entitled to benefits, including
          substantial severance packages, if their employment is terminated
          after a change of control of Autoweb, such as the merger;

        - Autobytel has entered into an employment agreement with Jeffrey
          Schwartz, an executive officer of Autoweb, that takes effect upon
          consummation of the merger and may enter into agreements with other
          executive officers; and

        - Autobytel has agreed to cause the surviving corporation in the merger
          to indemnify each present and former Autoweb officer and director
          against liabilities arising out of such person's services as an
          officer or director. Autobytel will use commercially reasonable
          efforts to cause the surviving corporation to maintain officers' and
          directors' liability insurance to cover any such liabilities for the
          next six years.

     The directors and officers of Autoweb may therefore have been more likely
to vote to approve the acquisition agreement and the merger than if they did not
have these interests. Autoweb stockholders should consider whether these
interests may have influenced these directors and officers to support or
recommend the merger. You should read more about these interests under
"Interests of Autoweb Directors, Officers, Employees and Significant
Stockholders in the Merger" on page   , "Employment Contracts and Termination of
Employment and Change-in-Control Arrangements" on page   and under "Employment
Agreements" on page   .

RISKS RELATED TO THE COMBINED BUSINESSES AFTER THE MERGER

BOTH AUTOBYTEL AND AUTOWEB HAVE A HISTORY OF NET LOSSES AND AUTOBYTEL CANNOT
ASSURE YOU THAT IT WILL BE PROFITABLE AFTER THE MERGER IS COMPLETED. IF
AUTOBYTEL CONTINUES TO LOSE MONEY, ITS OPERATIONS WILL NOT BE FINANCIALLY
VIABLE.

     Because of the relatively recent emergence of the Internet-based vehicle
information and purchasing industry, none of Autobytel's senior executives has
long-term experience in the industry. This limited operating history means it is
difficult for Autobytel to predict future operating results.

     Autobytel has incurred losses every quarter since inception and expects to
continue to incur losses until the second half of 2001. Even if Autobytel were
to achieve profitability in the second half of 2001, it might fail to sustain or
increase that profitability on a quarterly or annual basis. Autobytel cannot
assure that it will be profitable during such period or thereafter. Autobytel,
including A.I.N. Corporation, either referred to herein as A.I.N. or CarSmart,
had an accumulated deficit of $99.7 million as of March 31, 2001 and $95.6
million as of December 31, 2000. Autoweb has incurred net losses in each fiscal
year since its inception, including a net loss of $38.4 million in 2000. Autoweb
had an accumulated deficit of $93.3 million as of March 31, 2001. Thus, the
combined companies' accumulated net losses/deficit would be more than $180
million after the merger. We cannot assure you that the merger of Autobytel and
Autoweb, each of which has experienced losses in recent years, will result in a
profitable combined company.

     Autobytel's potential for future profitability after the merger must be
considered in light of the risks, uncertainties, expenses and difficulties
frequently encountered by companies in the early stages of development,
particularly companies in new and rapidly evolving markets, such as the market
for Internet commerce. To achieve profitability, Autobytel must, among other
things:

     - generate increased vehicle buyer traffic to its Web sites including
       Autoweb's sites;

     - successfully introduce new products and services;

     - continue to send new and pre-owned vehicle purchase requests to dealers
       that result in sufficient dealer transactions to justify its fees;

     - continue to expand the number of dealers in Autobytel's network, in
       addition to retaining the Autoweb dealers, and enhance the quality of
       dealers;

     - respond to competitive developments;

     - maintain a high degree of customer satisfaction;

     - provide secure and easy to use Web sites for customers;

     - increase its brand name visibility;

     - continue to attract, retain and motivate qualified personnel; and

     - continue to upgrade and enhance its technologies to accommodate expanded
       service offerings and increased consumer traffic.

Autobytel cannot assure that the combined companies will be successful in
achieving these goals.

INTERNET COMMERCE IS NEW AND EVOLVING WITH FEW PROFITABLE BUSINESS MODELS.
AUTOBYTEL CANNOT ASSURE THAT THE BUSINESS MODEL, INCLUDING THE AUTOWEB BUSINESS,
WILL BE PROFITABLE.

     The market for Internet-based purchasing services has only recently begun
to develop and is rapidly evolving. While many Internet commerce companies have
grown in terms of revenues, few are profitable. Autobytel cannot assure that it
will be profitable. As is typical for a new and rapidly evolving industry,
demand and market acceptance for recently introduced services and products over
the Internet are subject to a high level of uncertainty and there are few proven
services and products. Moreover, since the market for such services is still
evolving, it is difficult to predict the future growth rate, if any, and size of
this market. The extent to which other participants in the automotive industry
will accept the role of third-party, all-make, all-model services such as
Autobytel and Autoweb is not yet known.

AUTOBYTEL'S AND AUTOWEB'S QUARTERLY FINANCIAL RESULTS ARE SUBJECT TO SIGNIFICANT
FLUCTUATIONS WHICH MAY MAKE IT DIFFICULT FOR INVESTORS TO PREDICT AUTOBYTEL'S
FUTURE PERFORMANCE.

     Each of Autobytel's and Autoweb's quarterly operating results have
fluctuated in the past, and the combined companies' results may fluctuate in the
future due to many factors. Autobytel's expense levels are based in part on its
expectations of future revenues which may vary significantly. If revenues do not
increase faster than expenses, Autobytel's business, results of operations and
financial condition will be materially and adversely affected even after giving
effect to the merger. Other factors that may adversely affect Autobytel's
quarterly operating results include:

     - Autobytel's ability to retain existing dealers, including those added by
       the merger, attract new dealers and maintain dealer and customer
       satisfaction;

     - the announcement or introduction of new or enhanced sites, services and
       products by Autobytel or Autobytel's competitors;

     - Autobytel's ability to joint venture with investors in the development of
       Autobytel-branded companies internationally;

     - general economic conditions and economic conditions specific to the
       Internet, online commerce or the automobile industry;

     - a decline in the usage levels of online services and consumer acceptance
       of the Internet and commercial online services for the purchase of
       consumer products and services such as those offered by Autobytel;

     - Autobytel's ability to upgrade and develop its systems and infrastructure
       and to attract new personnel in a timely and effective manner;

     - the level of traffic on Autobytel's Web sites, including the Autoweb
       sites, and other sites that refer traffic to Autobytel's Web sites;

     - technical difficulties, system downtime or Internet brownouts;

     - the amount and timing of operating costs and capital expenditures
       relating to expansion of Autobytel's business, operations and
       infrastructure;

     - governmental regulation; and

     - unforeseen events affecting the industry.

SEASONALITY IS LIKELY TO CAUSE FLUCTUATIONS IN AUTOBYTEL'S OPERATING RESULTS
AFTER THE MERGER. INVESTORS MAY NOT BE ABLE TO PREDICT AUTOBYTEL'S ANNUAL
OPERATING RESULTS BASED ON A QUARTER TO QUARTER COMPARISON OF AUTOBYTEL'S
OPERATING RESULTS.

     Autobytel expects the combined business to experience seasonality as it
matures. The seasonal patterns of Internet usage and vehicle purchasing do not
completely overlap. Historically, Internet usage typically declines during
summer and certain holiday periods, while vehicle purchasing in the United
States is strongest in the spring and summer months. If seasonality occurs,
investors may not be able to predict Autobytel's annual operating results based
on a quarter to quarter comparison of Autobytel's operating results, not only
because of seasonability but because the merger will make comparison to
historical results more difficult. Seasonality in the automotive industry,
Internet and commercial online service usage and advertising expenditures is
likely to cause fluctuations in the combined companies' operating results and
could have a material adverse effect on their business, operating results and
financial condition.

AUTOBYTEL IS A NEW BUSINESS IN A NEW INDUSTRY WHICH, AS EVIDENCED BY THE MERGER,
IS CHANGING AND NEEDS TO MANAGE ITS GROWTH AND ITS ENTRY INTO NEW BUSINESS AREAS
TO AVOID INCREASED EXPENSES WITHOUT CORRESPONDING REVENUES.

     Autobytel has been constantly expanding its operations and introducing new
services to consumers and dealers to establish itself as a leader in the
evolving market for Internet-based vehicle purchasing and related services.
Autobytel also intends to enter into new markets overseas. The growth of
Autobytel's operations, including the growth resulting from the merger, may
require Autobytel to increase expenditures. For example, Autobytel will, after
the merger, continue to need to hire personnel to oversee the introduction of
new services before it generates revenues from these services. Autobytel's
inability to generate satisfactory revenues from such expanded services to
offset costs could have a material adverse effect on Autobytel's business,
financial condition and results of operations.

     Autobytel must also:

     - test, introduce and develop new services and products, including
       enhancing its Web sites, including Autoweb's sites,

     - expand the breadth of products and services offered,

     - expand Autobytel's market presence through relationships with third
       parties,

     - successfully and timely integrate Autoweb's technology and business, and

     - acquire new or complementary businesses, products or technologies.

     Even with the increased services and relationships resulting from the
merger, Autobytel cannot assure that it can successfully manage these tasks.

IF AUTOBYTEL'S DEALER TURNOVER INCREASES, AUTOBYTEL'S DEALER NETWORKS AND
REVENUES DERIVED FROM THESE NETWORKS MAY DECREASE.

     The majority of Autobytel's revenues are derived from fees paid by
Autobytel's networks of subscribing dealers. Autoweb primarily charges its
member dealers for each qualified purchase inquiry delivered. After the merger
both models will be available to dealers from the combined companies, but

both models are subject to dealer turnover. If dealer turnover increases and the
combined companies are unable to add new dealers to mitigate the turnover,
revenues may decrease. In addition, if Autobytel fails to retain and increase
existing levels of consumer usage on Autoweb Web sites, or cannot retain and
increase the number of Autoweb's commercial relationships, dealer revenues could
decrease and the combined companies' business, results of operations and
financial condition will be materially and adversely affected. A material factor
affecting dealer turnover is the ability to provide dealers with high quality
purchase requests. High quality purchase requests are those that result in high
closing ratios. Closing ratio is the ratio of the number of vehicles purchased
at a dealer generated from purchase requests to the total number of purchase
requests sent to that dealer. All of Autobytel's current subscribing dealers
have entered into written marketing agreements with Autobytel having a stated
term of one year, three years or five years, but the Autobytel dealer agreements
are cancelable by the dealer upon 30 days notice. A significant number of the
agreements are for a one year term. Some of Autoweb's current dealers have
entered into three year service agreements that are also terminable on 30-day's
notice. Autobytel cannot assure that dealers will not terminate their agreements
with Autobytel or Autoweb. Subscribing dealers may terminate their relationship
with Autobytel or Autoweb for any reason, including an unwillingness to accept
subscription terms or as a result of joining alternative marketing programs.
Autobytel's and Autoweb's businesses are dependent upon their ability to attract
and retain qualified new and pre-owned vehicle dealers. During the first quarter
of 2001, Autobytel added approximately 300 subscribing dealers to Autobytel's
North American dealer networks, and approximately 700 subscribing dealers
terminated their affiliation with Autobytel or were terminated by Autobytel.
During the first quarter of 2001, Autoweb added approximately 115 member
dealers, and approximately 780 member dealers terminated their affiliation with
Autoweb or were terminated by Autoweb. To grow or maintain Autobytel's and
Autoweb's dealer networks, they need to reduce dealer turnover. Autobytel cannot
assure that the combined companies will be able to reduce the level of dealer
turnover, and failure to do so could materially and adversely affect their
business, results of operations and financial condition.

     As of March 31, 2001, Autobytel and Autoweb had approximately 4,700 dealers
and 4,400 dealers, respectively. Autoweb's member dealer fees represented
approximately 60%, 66% and 78% of its revenues in 2000, 1999 and 1998,
respectively. For the quarter ended March 31, 2001, member dealer fees
represented approximately 60% of revenues. Autobytel's program fees represented
approximately 81%, 89% and 96% of its revenue in 2000, 1999 and 1998,
respectively. For the first quarter ended March 31, 2001, program fees
represented approximately 77% of Autobytel's revenues. Recognizing differences
in the way dealer revenues are generated and taking into account overlap of the
same dealers, Autobytel anticipates that after the merger the combined companies
will have approximately 7,000 dealers. However, due to the overlap of provided
services, termination of services or changes in services due to integration of
the two companies, some of these dealers may terminate their relationships with
Autobytel or Autoweb.

AUTOBYTEL AND AUTOWEB RELY HEAVILY ON THEIR PARTICIPATING DEALERS TO PROMOTE
THEIR BRAND VALUE BY PROVIDING HIGH QUALITY SERVICES TO THEIR CONSUMERS. IF
DEALERS DO NOT PROVIDE AUTOBYTEL'S CONSUMERS, INCLUDING AUTOWEB CONSUMERS, HIGH
QUALITY SERVICES, ITS BRAND VALUE WILL DIMINISH AND THE NUMBER OF CONSUMERS WHO
USE AUTOBYTEL'S SERVICES MAY DECLINE, CAUSING A DECREASE IN THE COMBINED
COMPANIES' REVENUES.

     Promotion of Autobytel's brand value, including the Autoweb brand, depends
on the ability to provide consumers a high quality experience for purchasing
vehicles throughout the purchasing process. If Autobytel's dealers do not
provide consumers with high quality service, the value of Autobytel's brands
could be damaged and the number of consumers using Autobytel's services,
including those who use the Autoweb sites, may decrease. Autobytel now devotes
significant efforts, and the combined company will need to devote its efforts,
to train participating dealers in practices that are intended to increase
consumer satisfaction. Autobytel's inability to train dealers effectively, or
the failure by participating dealers to adopt recommended practices, respond
rapidly and professionally to vehicle inquiries, or sell and lease vehicles in
accordance with Autobytel's marketing strategies could result in low consumer
satisfaction, damage one or more Autobytel brands and could materially and
adversely affect the combined companies' business, results of operations and
financial condition after the merger.

AUTOBYTEL MAY LOSE SUBSCRIBING DEALERS IF AUTOBYTEL RECONFIGURES DEALER
TERRITORIES. IF AUTOBYTEL LOSES DEALERS, THE COMBINED COMPANIES WILL LOSE THE
REVENUES ASSOCIATED WITH THOSE DEALERS.

     If the volume of purchase requests increases, Autobytel may need to reduce
or reconfigure the exclusive territories currently assigned to dealers to serve
consumers more effectively. If a dealer is unwilling to accept a reduction or
reconfiguration of its territory, it may terminate its relationship with
Autobytel. A dealer also could sue Autobytel to prevent such reduction or
reconfiguration, or collect damages from Autobytel. Autobytel has experienced
one such lawsuit. A material decrease in the number of dealers subscribing to
Autobytel's network or litigation with dealers could have a material adverse
effect on the combined companies' business, results of operations and financial
condition.

IF ANY OF AUTOBYTEL'S OR AUTOWEB'S RELATIONSHIPS WITH INTERNET SEARCH ENGINES OR
ONLINE AUTOMOTIVE INFORMATION PROVIDERS TERMINATES, THEIR COMBINED PURCHASE
REQUEST VOLUME COULD DECLINE. IF PURCHASE REQUEST VOLUME OR THE QUALITY OF LEADS
DECLINES, PARTICIPATING DEALERS MAY TERMINATE THEIR RELATIONSHIP WITH AUTOBYTEL
OR FORCE AUTOBYTEL TO DECREASE THE FEES CHARGED FOR ITS SERVICES. IF THIS
OCCURS, THE COMBINED COMPANIES' REVENUES WOULD DECREASE.

     Autobytel and Autoweb depend on a number of strategic relationships to
direct a substantial amount of purchase requests and traffic to their Web sites.
After the merger is completed, the termination of any of these relationships or
any significant reduction in traffic to Web sites on which Autobytel's services,
including Autoweb services, are advertised or offered, or the failure to develop
additional referral sources, would cause purchase request volume, or the quality
of requests, to decline. If this occurs, dealers might no longer be satisfied
with Autobytel's service and might terminate their relationships with Autobytel
or force Autobytel to decrease the fees Autobytel charges for services. If
Autobytel's dealers terminate their relationships with Autobytel or force
Autobytel to reduce the fees it charges for its services, Autobytel's revenues
will decline which could have a material adverse effect on the combined
companies' business, results of operations and financial condition.

     Autobytel and Autoweb receive a significant number of purchase requests
through a limited number of Internet search engines, online automotive
information providers, and other auto related Internet sites. Autobytel and
Autoweb periodically negotiate revisions to existing agreements and such
revisions could increase costs in future periods. During the first quarter of
2001, approximately 33% of Autobytel's purchase requests came through
StoneAge.com. The agreement with StoneAge Corporation expires in March 2002 and
unless terminated by either party, automatically renews for a term of up to
twelve (12) months. During the year 2000, approximately 23% of Autoweb's new
car, and 10% of Autoweb's pre-owned car, purchase requests came through
relationships with AOL and Lycos which were recently renegotiated to lower
costs. The impact of the restructured agreements on costs and the volume of
requests is not yet known. Autobytel may not be able to maintain its
relationship with its or Autoweb's online service providers or find alternative,
comparable marketing sponsorships and alliances capable of originating
significant numbers of purchase requests on terms satisfactory to Autobytel. A
number of Autobytel's and Autoweb's agreements with online service providers may
be terminated without cause.

IF ANY OF AUTOBYTEL'S OR AUTOWEB'S RELATIONSHIPS WITH OTHER STRATEGIC PARTIES
TERMINATES, THE COMBINED COMPANIES' BUSINESS, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND
FINANCIAL CONDITION COULD SUFFER.

     Autobytel and Autoweb have established, and Autobytel intends to continue
to establish, key strategic relationships in the automotive, financial services,
insurance, data aggregation and information services industries and in
Internet-related industries. Autobytel intends to develop and offer a variety of
services for Autobytel's customers, including Autoweb's customers, including
financing, leasing, warranties and insurance options and provision of automotive
industry-related information. In particular, Autobytel's and Autoweb's
relationships with lenders and financial institutions, insurance companies,
automotive industry data aggregators, extended warranty providers and other
Internet Web site businesses, including Internet search engines, are crucial to
the continued development and future success of the combined business. In the
event that Autobytel's strategic partners were no longer interested in
maintaining or establishing relationships with Autobytel on commercially viable
terms, Autobytel's ability to provide a full range of

cost-effective services to its customers would be adversely affected and the
combined companies' business, results of operations and financial condition
could suffer.

     Autobytel and Autoweb currently license from third parties certain
technologies and information incorporated into their Web sites. As Autobytel
continues to introduce new services that incorporate new technologies and
information, Autobytel may be required to license additional technology and
information from others. Autobytel cannot assure that these third-party
technology and information licenses will continue to be available to Autobytel
on commercially reasonable terms, if at all, after the merger. Additionally,
Autobytel cannot assure that the third parties from which Autobytel and Autoweb
currently license their technology and information will be able to defend their
proprietary rights successfully against claims of infringement. Any failure to
obtain any of these technology and information licenses could result in delays
or reductions in the introduction of new features, functions or services. It
could also adversely affect the performance of the combined companies' existing
services until equivalent technology or information can be identified, obtained
and integrated.

     Autobytel and Autoweb have entered into agreements with various partners,
some of which require Autobytel or Autoweb to feature them exclusively in
certain sections of their Web sites. After the merger, existing and future
exclusive arrangements may prevent Autobytel from entering into other content
agreements, advertising or sponsorship arrangements or other commercial
relationships. Many companies that Autobytel may pursue for a commercial
relationship may also offer competing services. As a result, these competitors
may be reluctant to enter into commercial relationships with Autobytel.
Autobytel's business could be adversely affected if Autobytel does not maintain
the existing commercial relationships, including those set up by Autoweb, on
terms as favorable as currently in effect, if Autobytel does not establish
additional commercial relationships on commercially reasonable terms or if
Autobytel's commercial relationships do not result in the expected increased use
of Autobytel's Web sites. Failure of one or more of Autobytel's or Autoweb's
relationships to achieve or maintain market acceptance or commercial success or
the termination of one or more relationships could have a material adverse
effect on the combined companies' business, results of operations and financial
condition.

INTENSE COMPETITION COULD REDUCE AUTOBYTEL'S MARKET SHARE, EVEN AFTER GIVING
EFFECT TO THE MERGER, AND HARM ITS FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE. AUTOBYTEL'S MARKET IS
COMPETITIVE NOT ONLY BECAUSE THE INTERNET HAS MINIMAL TECHNICAL BARRIERS TO
ENTRY, BUT ALSO BECAUSE AUTOBYTEL AND AUTOWEB COMPETE DIRECTLY WITH OTHER
COMPANIES IN THE OFFLINE ENVIRONMENT.

     Autobytel's and Autoweb's vehicle purchasing services compete against a
variety of Internet and traditional vehicle purchasing services, automotive
brokers and classified advertisement providers. Therefore, they are affected by
the competitive factors faced by both Internet commerce companies as well as
traditional, offline companies within the automotive and automotive-related
industries. The market for Internet-based commercial services is new, and
competition among commercial Web sites may increase significantly in the future.
Autobytel's and Autoweb's business is characterized by minimal technical
barriers to entry, and new competitors can launch a competitive service at
relatively low cost. To compete successfully, Autobytel must significantly
increase awareness of its services and brand names. Failure to compete
successfully will cause the combined companies' revenues to decline and would
have a material adverse effect on their business, results of operations and
financial condition.

     Autobytel and Autoweb compete with other entities which maintain similar
commercial Web sites including AutoVantage, Microsoft Corporation's CarPoint,
CarsDirect.com, Cars.com, Cobalt Group and AutoTrader.com. AutoNation, a large
consolidator of dealers, has a Web site for marketing vehicles. Autobytel also
competes, and the combined companies after the merger will compete, indirectly
against vehicle brokerage firms and affinity programs offered by several
companies, including Costco Wholesale Corporation and Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. In
addition, all major vehicle manufacturers have their own Web sites and many have
launched online buying services, such as General Motors Corporation's BuyPower
and Ford Motor Company's FordDirect.com. Autobytel and Autoweb also compete with
vehicle insurers, lenders and lessors as well as other dealers that are not part
of Autobytel's network. Such companies may

already maintain or may introduce Web sites which compete with Autobytel's Web
sites, including the Autoweb sites.

     Autobytel believes that the principal competitive factors in the online
market are:

     - brand recognition;

     - speed and quality of fulfillment;

     - variety of related products and services;

     - ease of use;

     - customer satisfaction;

     - quality of Web site content;

     - quality of service; and

     - technical expertise.

     Autobytel cannot assure that it can compete successfully against current or
future competitors, many of which have substantially more capital, existing
brand recognition, resources and access to additional financing. In addition,
competitive pressures may result in increased marketing costs, decreased Web
site traffic or loss of market share or otherwise may materially and adversely
affect the combined companies' business, results of operations and financial
condition.

IF AUTOBYTEL CANNOT BUILD AND MAINTAIN STRONG BRAND LOYALTY, ITS BUSINESS WILL
SUFFER.

     Autobytel believes that the importance of brand recognition will increase
as more companies engage in commerce over the Internet. Development and
awareness of the Autobytel.com, CarSmart.com, Autoweb.com and Autosite.com
brands will depend largely on Autobytel's ability to obtain a leadership
position in Internet commerce. If dealers do not perceive the combined companies
as an effective channel for increasing vehicle sales, or consumers do not
perceive Autobytel, including Autoweb, as offering reliable information
concerning new and pre-owned vehicles, as well as referrals to high quality
dealers, in a user-friendly manner that reduces the time spent for vehicle
purchases, the combined companies will be unsuccessful in promoting and
maintaining their brands. Failure to gain widespread brand acceptance among
consumers or dealers would have a material adverse effect on the combined
companies' business, results of operations and financial condition.

IF AUTOBYTEL LOSES KEY PERSONNEL OR IS UNABLE TO ATTRACT, TRAIN AND RETAIN
ADDITIONAL HIGHLY QUALIFIED SALES, MARKETING, MANAGERIAL AND TECHNICAL
PERSONNEL, THE COMBINED COMPANIES' BUSINESS MAY SUFFER.

     Autobytel's future success depends on Autobytel's ability to identify,
hire, train and retain highly qualified sales, marketing, managerial and
technical personnel. In addition, as the combined companies introduce new
services, they may need to hire additional personnel. Current and prospective
Autoweb employees may experience uncertainty about their future roles with
Autobytel and may, as a result, seek other employment. Autobytel may be unable
to retain Autobytel and Autoweb management and technical, sales and customer
support personnel that are critical to the successful integration of Autobytel
and Autoweb, resulting in disruption of operations, loss of key information,
expertise or know-how and unanticipated additional recruitment and training
costs and otherwise diminishing anticipated benefits of the merger. Competition
for such personnel is intense, and Autobytel may not be able to attract,
assimilate or retain such personnel in the future. The inability to attract and
retain the necessary managerial, technical, sales and marketing personnel could
have a material adverse effect on the combined companies' business, results of
operations and financial condition.

     Autobytel's business and operations are substantially dependent on the
performance of Autobytel's executive officers and key employees, some of whom
are employed on an at-will basis and all of whom have worked together for only a
short period of time. Autobytel maintains "key person" life insurance in

the amount of $3.0 million on the life of Mark W. Lorimer, Autobytel's Chief
Executive Officer and President. The loss of the services of Mr. Lorimer or one
or more of Autobytel's other executive officers or key employees could have a
material adverse effect on the combined companies' business, results of
operations and financial condition.

AUTOBYTEL'S INTERNATIONAL EXPANSION MAY REQUIRE COMPLIANCE WITH BURDENSOME
REGULATORY, TARIFF AND LICENSING REQUIREMENTS. AUTOBYTEL'S NEED TO COMPLY WITH
GOVERNMENTAL REQUIREMENTS MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT ITS ABILITY TO EXPAND ITS
BUSINESS.

     Autobytel's licensees have launched Web sites in the United Kingdom,
Sweden, The Netherlands, Spain, Australia and Japan. Autobytel intends to expand
Autobytel's brand into other foreign markets through licensing its technology,
business processes and trade names and by establishing relationships with
vehicle dealers and strategic investors located in foreign markets.

     By expanding Autobytel's operations to various other countries, Autobytel
may become subject to laws or treaties that regulate the marketing, distribution
and sale of motor vehicles. Autobytel will need to spend its resources to
determine whether the laws of the countries in which Autobytel seeks to operate
require Autobytel to modify, or prohibit the use of, Autobytel's system. In
addition, the laws of other countries may impose licensing, bonding or similar
requirements on Autobytel as a condition to doing business in these countries.

AUTOBYTEL MAY NOT BE SUCCESSFUL IN EXPANDING ITS BUSINESS ABROAD, WHICH MAY
LIMIT THE COMBINED COMPANIES' FUTURE GROWTH.

     Autobytel has had limited experience in providing its service abroad and
Autobytel cannot be certain that it will be successful in introducing or
marketing its services abroad. In addition, there are risks inherent in
conducting business in international markets, such as:

     - changes in political conditions;

     - regulatory requirements, including with respect to the sale, marketing
       and distribution of motor vehicles and related products and services;

     - potentially weaker intellectual property protections;

     - tariffs and other trade barriers, fluctuations in currency exchange
       rates, or potentially adverse tax consequences;

     - difficulties in managing or overseeing foreign operations; and

     - educating consumers and dealers who may be unfamiliar with the benefits
       of online marketing and commerce.

     One or more of such factors may have a material adverse effect on the
combined companies' current or future international operations and,
consequently, on their business, results of operations and financial condition.

AUTOBYTEL'S FOUNDERS, OFFICERS AND DIRECTORS AND THEIR AFFILIATES AND AUTOWEB'S
OFFICERS AND DIRECTORS WILL HAVE SUBSTANTIAL CONTROL OF AUTOBYTEL'S VOTING STOCK
AFTER THE MERGER IS COMPLETED AND WILL HAVE THE ABILITY TO SIGNIFICANTLY
INFLUENCE AND IN ALL LIKELIHOOD MAKE DECISIONS THAT COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT
STOCKHOLDERS AND AUTOBYTEL'S STOCK PRICE AFTER THE MERGER.

     The continued control of a large amount of Autobytel's stock by insiders
after the merger could have an adverse effect on the market price of Autobytel's
common stock. As of March 31, 2001, Autobytel's executive officers and directors
beneficially own or control approximately 4.0 million shares or 17.9% of the
outstanding shares of Autobytel's common stock. In addition, as of such date,
based on information available to Autobytel, Autobytel's founders, Peter Ellis
and John Bedrosian, beneficially own or control approximately 7.8% and 12.3%,
respectively, of the outstanding shares of Autobytel's common stock. Also,

as of March 31, 2001, Autoweb's executive officers and directors beneficially
own or control approximately 10,100,378 shares or 33.1% of the outstanding
shares of Autoweb's common stock. If the merger were to be completed today,
these shares would be converted into 3,588,664 shares or 17.6% of the
outstanding shares of Autobytel's common stock and the shares held by
Autobytel's officers and directors and their affiliates would represent [  ]% of
the outstanding shares of Autobytel's common stock. Autobytel's officers,
directors, founders and their affiliates, and Autoweb's officers and directors,
assuming they vote together, have the ability to significantly influence and
substantially control the election of Autobytel's board of directors and the
outcome of corporate actions requiring stockholder approval, including mergers
and other changes of corporate control, going private transactions and other
extraordinary transactions.

AUTOBYTEL IS UNCERTAIN OF ITS ABILITY TO OBTAIN ADDITIONAL FINANCING FOR THE
FUTURE CAPITAL NEEDS OF THE COMBINED COMPANIES. IF AUTOBYTEL IS UNABLE TO OBTAIN
ADDITIONAL FINANCING, IT MAY NOT BE ABLE TO CONTINUE TO OPERATE THE COMBINED
BUSINESS.

     Autobytel currently anticipates that the combined companies' cash, cash
equivalents and short-term investments will be sufficient to meet their working
capital and other cash requirements at least for the next twelve months.
Autobytel may need to raise additional funds in order to fund rapid expansion,
to develop new or enhance existing services or products, to respond to
competitive pressures or to acquire complementary products, businesses or
technologies. There can be no assurance that additional financing will be
available on terms favorable to Autobytel, or at all. If adequate funds are not
available or are not available on acceptable terms, Autobytel's ability to fund
expansion, take advantage of additional potential acquisition opportunities,
develop or enhance services or products or respond to competitive pressures
would be significantly limited. Such limitation could have a material adverse
effect on the combined companies' business, results of operations, financial
condition and prospects.

AUTOBYTEL'S CERTIFICATE OF INCORPORATION AND BY-LAWS AND DELAWARE LAW CONTAIN
PROVISIONS THAT COULD DISCOURAGE A THIRD PARTY FROM ACQUIRING AUTOBYTEL OR LIMIT
THE PRICE THIRD PARTIES ARE WILLING TO PAY FOR AUTOBYTEL'S STOCK.

     Provisions of Autobytel's amended and restated certificate of incorporation
and bylaws relating to Autobytel's corporate governance could make it difficult
for a third party to acquire Autobytel and could discourage a third party from
attempting to acquire control of Autobytel. These provisions allow Autobytel to
issue preferred stock with rights senior to those of the common stock without
any further vote or action by the stockholders. These provisions provide that
the board of directors is divided into three classes, which may have the effect
of delaying or preventing changes in control or change in Autobytel's management
because less than a majority of the board of directors are up for election at
each annual meeting. In addition, these provisions impose various procedural and
other requirements which could make it more difficult for stockholders to effect
corporate actions such as a merger, asset sale or other change of control of
Autobytel. Such charter provisions could limit the price that certain investors
might be willing to pay in the future for shares of Autobytel's common stock and
may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control. The issuance
of preferred stock also could decrease the amount of earnings and assets
available for distribution to the holders of common stock or could adversely
affect the rights and powers, including voting rights, of the holders of the
common stock.

     Autobytel is also subject to the anti-takeover provisions of Section 203 of
the Delaware General Corporation Law. In general, the statute prohibits a
publicly held Delaware corporation from engaging in a "business combination"
with an "interested stockholder" for a period of three years after the date of
the transaction in which the person became an interested stockholder, unless the
business combination is approved in a prescribed manner. For purposes of Section
203, a "business combination" includes a merger, asset sale or other transaction
resulting in a financial benefit to the interested stockholder, and an
"interested stockholder" is a person who, together with affiliates and
associates, owns or did own 15% or more of the corporation's voting stock.

AUTOBYTEL, INCLUDING AUTOWEB, MAY BE PARTICULARLY AFFECTED BY GENERAL ECONOMIC
CONDITIONS DUE TO THE NATURE OF THE AUTOMOTIVE INDUSTRY.

     The economic strength of the automotive industry significantly impacts the
revenues Autobytel and Autoweb derive, and will impact the revenues the combined
companies will derive, from dealers, vehicle manufacturers and other strategic
partners, advertising revenues and consumer traffic to their Web sites. The
automotive industry is cyclical, with vehicle sales fluctuating due to changes
in national and global economic forces. Purchases of vehicles are typically
discretionary for consumers and may be particularly affected by negative trends
in the general economy. The success of the combined companies after the merger
depends to a significant extent upon a number of factors relating to
discretionary consumer spending, including economic conditions, and perceptions
of such conditions by consumers, affecting disposable consumer income, such as
employment, wages and salaries, business conditions and interest rates in
regional and local markets.

     In addition, because the purchase of a vehicle is a significant investment
and is relatively discretionary, any reduction in disposable income in general
or a general increase in interest rates or a general tightening of lending may
affect Autobytel, including Autoweb, more significantly than companies in other
industries.

     While 1999 and 2000 were record years for the automotive industry in
general in terms of volume of new vehicles sold, during 2001 the automotive
industry will likely experience significant fall-off in demand for new vehicles.
Autobytel cannot assure that the combined business will not be materially
adversely affected as a result of an industry or general economic downturn.

CURRENT AND FUTURE GOVERNMENT REGULATIONS MAY RESULT IN ADMINISTRATIVE MONETARY
FINES, PENALTIES OR TAXES THAT MAY REDUCE THE COMBINED COMPANIES' FUTURE
EARNINGS AND HARM THE COMBINED COMPANIES' BUSINESS.

     Although there are currently few laws or regulations that apply directly to
the Internet, a number of legislative and regulatory proposals under
consideration by federal, state, local and foreign governmental organizations
may lead to laws or regulations concerning various aspects of the Internet,
including, but not limited to, online content, user privacy, taxation, access
charges, liability for third-party activities and jurisdiction. It is uncertain
how existing laws will be applied to the Internet. The adoption of new local,
state, national or international laws or regulations may decrease the growth of
Internet usage or the acceptance of Internet commerce which could, in turn,
decrease the demand for Autobytel's services, including the Autoweb services,
and increase costs or otherwise have a material adverse effect on the combined
companies' business, results of operations and financial condition. The
applications of existing laws and regulations relating to issues such as user
privacy, defamation, pricing, taxation, promotions, content regulation,
intellectual property ownership and infringement can be unclear. Any existing or
new legislation applicable to the combined companies could expose them to
substantial liability, including significant expenses necessary to comply with
such laws and regulations.

     The tax treatment of the Internet and e-commerce is currently unsettled. A
number of proposals have been made at the federal, state and local levels and by
certain foreign governments that could impose taxes on the sale of goods and
services and certain other Internet activities. The Internet Tax Freedom Act,
signed into law in October 1998, placed a three-year moratorium on new state and
local taxes on Internet commerce. Autobytel cannot assure that future laws
imposing taxes or other regulations on commerce over the Internet would not
substantially impair the growth of e-commerce and the growth of Autobytel's and
Autoweb's combined business.

IF CONSUMERS DO NOT ADOPT INTERNET COMMERCE AS A MAINSTREAM MEDIUM OF COMMERCE
OR IF AUTOMOTIVE INDUSTRY PARTICIPANTS RESIST THE ROLE OF THIRD-PARTY SERVICES,
THE COMBINED COMPANIES' REVENUES MAY NOT GROW AND THEIR EARNINGS MAY SUFFER.

     After the merger, the success of Autobytel's services, including the
Autoweb services, will continue to depend upon the adoption of the Internet by
consumers and dealers as a mainstream medium for commerce and/or the willingness
of automotive manufacturers to cooperate with third party services.

While Autobytel believes that its services, and Autoweb's services, offer
significant advantages to consumers and dealers, there can be no assurance that
widespread acceptance of Internet commerce in general, or of Autobytel's and
Autoweb's services in particular, will occur or that automotive companies will
continue to accept a role for third-party services such as Autobytel and
Autoweb. Autobytel's business model assumes that consumers and dealers who have
historically relied upon traditional means of commerce to purchase or lease
vehicles, and to procure vehicle financing and insurance, will accept new
methods of conducting business and exchanging information and that automotive
manufacturers will accept, rather than resist, a role for all make, all model,
third-party sites such as Autoweb.com and Autobytel.com which invite
comparisons. If the market for third-party Internet-based vehicle marketing
services fails to develop further, develops slower than expected, faces
opposition or becomes saturated with competitors, or if the combined companies'
services do not achieve market acceptance, their business, results of operations
and financial condition will be materially and adversely affected.

INTERNET-RELATED ISSUES MAY REDUCE OR SLOW THE GROWTH IN THE USE OF AUTOBYTEL'S
OR AUTOWEB'S SERVICES IN THE FUTURE.

     Critical issues concerning the commercial use of the Internet, such as,
ease of access, security, reliability, cost, and quality of service, remain
unresolved and may impact the growth of Internet use. If Internet usage
continues to increase rapidly, the Internet infrastructure may not be able to
support the demands placed on it by this growth, and its performance and
reliability may decline. The recent growth in Internet traffic has caused
frequent periods of decreased performance, outages and delays. Autobytel's
ability to increase the speed with which the combined companies provide services
to consumers and to increase the scope and quality of such services is limited
by and dependent upon the speed and reliability of the Internet, which is beyond
Autobytel's control. If periods of decreased performance, outages or delays on
the Internet occur frequently, overall Internet usage or usage of Autobytel's
Web sites, including Autoweb's sites, could increase more slowly or decline.

IF AUTOBYTEL IS UNABLE TO KEEP PACE WITH ADVANCES IN TECHNOLOGY, CONSUMERS MAY
STOP USING THE COMBINED COMPANIES' SERVICES AND REVENUES WILL DECREASE.

     The Internet and electronic commerce markets are characterized by rapid
technological change, changes in user and customer requirements, frequent new
service and product introductions embodying new technologies and the emergence
of new industry standards and practices that could render Autobytel's or
Autoweb's existing Web sites and technology obsolete. These market
characteristics are exacerbated by the emerging nature of the market and the
fact that many companies are expected to introduce new Internet products and
services in the near future. If Autobytel is unable to adapt to changing
technologies, the combined companies' business, results of operations and
financial condition could be materially and adversely affected.

     Autobytel's performance after the merger will depend, in part, on its
ability to continue to enhance Autobytel's and Autoweb's existing services,
develop new technology that addresses the increasingly sophisticated and varied
needs of prospective customers, license leading technologies and respond to
technological advances and emerging industry standards and practices on a timely
and cost-effective basis. The development of Autobytel's Web sites, Dealer Real
Time and iManager systems, Autoweb's technology and other proprietary technology
entails significant technical and business risks. Autobytel may not be
successful in using new technologies effectively or adapting its technology,
Autoweb's technology or other proprietary technology to customer requirements or
to emerging industry standards. In addition, the widespread adoption of
developing multimedia-enabling technologies could require fundamental and costly
changes in its technology and affect the nature, viability and measurability of
Internet-based advertising, which could adversely affect the combined companies'
business, results of operations and financial condition.

AUTOBYTEL IS VULNERABLE TO ELECTRICITY BLACKOUTS AND COMMUNICATIONS SYSTEM
INTERRUPTIONS BECAUSE THE MAJORITY OF AUTOBYTEL'S PRIMARY SERVERS ARE LOCATED IN
A SINGLE LOCATION, AND AUTOWEB'S SERVERS ARE ALSO VULNERABLE TO SUCH
INTERRUPTIONS. IF ELECTRICITY OR COMMUNICATIONS TO AUTOBYTEL'S OR AUTOWEB'S
SERVERS WERE INTERRUPTED, THE COMBINED COMPANIES' OPERATIONS COULD BE ADVERSELY
AFFECTED.

     Autobytel presently hosts the majority of Autobytel's production Web sites
including Autobytel.com, Dealer Real Time and iManager systems at Autobytel's
corporate headquarters in Irvine, California. The Autoweb and Carsmart Web sites
are hosted by a third party service provider. Although offsite backup servers
are available from outside sources, primary servers located at Autobytel's
corporate headquarters are vulnerable to interruption by damage from fire,
earthquake, flood, power loss, telecommunications failure, break-ins and other
events beyond Autobytel's control. In the event that Autobytel or Autoweb
experiences significant system disruptions, their business, results of
operations and financial condition would be materially and adversely affected.
Autobytel has, from time to time, experienced periodic systems interruptions and
anticipates that such interruptions will occur in the future. As a result of a
variety of factors, available electricity supply in California is not sufficient
to meet demand at all times in some areas, and these constraints are projected
to continue for several years. The supply constraints have been managed, and
will likely continue to be managed, by a combination of obtaining additional
supplies, requested conservation, interruption of certain customers whose rates
include that possibility, and as a last resort, interruption of some or all
customers in certain areas through "rolling blackouts." Relieving the supply
constraints is likely to cause increases in the retail rates to be paid. To
date, neither Autobytel nor Autoweb has been significantly affected by rolling
blackouts or other interruptions in service related to the constraints on supply
and Autobytel has a backup generator available to protect itself against rolling
blackouts that last for a limited amount of time. Autoweb's and CarSmart's
service provider maintains backup generation capability, however, recently the
provider suffered a power disruption that caused its backup system to fail. This
outage did not have a material adverse effect on Autoweb or CarSmart. Autobytel
maintains business interruption insurance which pays up to $6 million for the
actual loss of business income sustained due to the suspension of operations as
a result of direct physical loss of or damage to property at Autobytel's
offices. However, in the event of a prolonged interruption, this business
interruption insurance may not be sufficient to fully compensate Autobytel for
the resulting losses to the combined companies.

AUTOBYTEL'S COMPUTER INFRASTRUCTURE MAY BE VULNERABLE TO SECURITY BREACHES. ANY
SUCH PROBLEMS COULD JEOPARDIZE CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION TRANSMITTED OVER THE
INTERNET, CAUSE INTERRUPTIONS IN AUTOBYTEL'S OPERATIONS OR CAUSE AUTOBYTEL TO
HAVE LIABILITY TO THIRD PERSONS.

     Autobytel's computer infrastructure, including the Autoweb infrastructure,
is potentially vulnerable to physical or electronic computer break-ins, viruses
and similar disruptive problems and security breaches. Any such problems or
security breaches could cause Autobytel or Autoweb to have liability to one or
more third parties and disrupt all or part of their operations after the merger.
Any of these events would have a material adverse effect on the combined
companies' business, results of operations and financial condition. A party who
is able to circumvent security measures could misappropriate proprietary
information, jeopardize the confidential nature of information transmitted over
the Internet or cause interruptions in the combined companies' operations.
Concerns over the security of Internet transactions and the privacy of users
could also inhibit the growth of the Internet in general, particularly as a
means of conducting commercial transactions. To the extent that Autobytel's or
Autoweb's activities or those of third party contractors involve the storage and
transmission of proprietary information such as personal financial information,
security breaches could expose them to a risk of financial loss, litigation and
other liabilities. Autobytel may be required to incur significant costs to
protect against security breaches or to alleviate problems caused by breaches.
Any well-publicized compromise of security could deter people from using the Web
to conduct transactions that involve transmitting confidential information such
as credit card information or downloading sensitive materials, which would cause
Autobytel's business, results of operations and financial condition to suffer.
Autobytel's insurance does not currently protect, and after the merger is not
expected to protect, against such losses.

AUTOBYTEL MAY INCUR LIABILITY FOR RETRIEVING AND TRANSMITTING INFORMATION OVER
THE INTERNET.

     The combined companies could face liability for information retrieved from
or transmitted over the Internet and liability for products sold over the
Internet. This could include liability with respect to third-party information
that may be accessible through Autobytel's Web sites, including the Autoweb
sites, links or car review services. Such claims might assert, among other
things, that, by directly or indirectly providing links to Web sites operated by
third parties, Autobytel should be liable for copyright or trademark
infringement or other wrongful actions by such third parties through such Web
sites. It is also possible that, if any third-party content information provided
on Autobytel Web sites, including the Autoweb sites, contains errors, consumers
could make claims against Autobytel for losses incurred in reliance on such
information.

     Autobytel and Autoweb also enter into agreements with other companies under
which any revenue that results from the purchase of services through direct
links to or from their Web sites is shared. Such arrangements may expose the
combined companies to additional legal risks and uncertainties, including local,
state, federal and foreign government regulation and potential liabilities to
consumers of these services, even if they do not provide the services
themselves. Autobytel cannot assure that any indemnification provided in
Autobytel's or Autoweb's agreements with these parties, if available, will be
adequate.

     Even to the extent such claims do not result in liability to the combined
companies, they could incur significant costs in investigating and defending
against such claims. The imposition after the merger, of potential liability for
information carried on or disseminated through Autobytel's system could require
measures to reduce exposure to such liability, which might require the
expenditure of substantial resources or limit the attractiveness of Autobytel's
services to consumers, dealers, and others.

     Autobytel's and Autoweb's general liability insurance and Autoweb's
communications liability insurance may not cover all potential claims to which
they are exposed and will be exposed after the merger and may not be adequate to
indemnify for all liability that may be imposed. Any imposition of liability
that is not covered by insurance or is in excess of insurance coverage could
have a material adverse effect on the combined companies' post-merger business,
results of operations and financial condition.

MISAPPROPRIATION OF AUTOBYTEL'S OR AUTOWEB'S INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY AND
PROPRIETARY RIGHTS COULD IMPAIR AUTOBYTEL'S POST-MERGER COMPETITIVE POSITION.

     Autobytel's and Autoweb's ability to compete depends upon proprietary
systems and technology. While both companies rely on trademark, trade secret and
copyright law, confidentiality agreements and technical measures to protect
proprietary rights, Autobytel believes that the technical and creative skills of
personnel, continued development of proprietary systems and technology, brand
name recognition and reliable Web site maintenance are more essential in
establishing and maintaining a leadership position and strengthening Autobytel's
post-merger brands. Despite Autobytel's efforts to protect its proprietary
rights, unauthorized parties may attempt to copy aspects of Autobytel's services
or to obtain and use information that Autobytel regards as proprietary. Policing
unauthorized use of Autobytel's proprietary rights is difficult.

     Autobytel cannot assure that the steps taken by Autobytel will prevent
misappropriation of technology or that the agreements entered into for that
purpose will be enforceable. Misappropriation of Autobytel's or Autoweb's
intellectual property or potential litigation could have a material adverse
effect on the combined companies' post-merger business, results of operations
and financial condition. Effective trademark, service mark, copyright and trade
secret protection may not be available in every country in which Autobytel's
post-merger products and services are made available online. In addition,
litigation may be necessary in the future to enforce or protect Autobytel's
intellectual property rights or to defend against claims or infringement or
invalidity. As part of their confidentiality procedures, Autobytel and Autoweb
generally enter into agreements with their employees and consultants and limit
access to trade secrets and technology.

AUTOBYTEL FACES RISKS OF CLAIMS FROM THIRD PARTIES RELATING TO INTELLECTUAL
PROPERTY THAT COULD HARM ITS POST-MERGER BUSINESS.

     As part of their business, Autobytel and Autoweb make Internet services and
content available to their customers. This creates the potential for claims to
be made against Autobytel or Autoweb, either directly or through contractual
indemnification provisions with partners. Any claims could result in costly
litigation, divert management's attention and resources, cause delays in
releasing new or upgrading existing services or require Autobytel to enter into
royalty or licensing agreements after the merger. These claims might, for
example, be made for defamation, negligence, patent, copyright or trademark
infringement, personal injury, breach of contract, unfair competition, false
advertising, invasion of privacy or other legal theories based on the nature,
content or copying of these materials. Liability, particularly if not covered by
Autobytel's or Autoweb's insurance or in excess of Autobytel's or Autoweb's
insurance coverage, could damage the post-merger business. In the past,
plaintiffs have brought these types of claims and sometimes successfully
litigated them against online services. Although Autobytel and Autoweb carry
general liability insurance, which is expected to be the practice after the
merger, insurance may not cover claims of these types or may be inadequate to
indemnify Autobytel for all liability that may be imposed.

     Litigation regarding intellectual property rights is common in the Internet
and software industries. Autobytel expects that Internet technologies and
software products and services may be increasingly subject to third-party
infringement claims as the number of competitors in Autobytel's industry segment
grows and the functionality of products in different industry segments overlaps.
There can be no assurance that Autobytel's services (including, after the
merger, Autoweb's services) do not infringe on the intellectual property rights
of third parties.

AUTOBYTEL AND AUTOWEB OR THEIR COMBINED BUSINESSES COULD BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED
BY LITIGATION.

     From time to time, Autobytel and Autoweb are involved in various legal
proceedings arising from the normal course of their business activities. In
addition, in April and May 2001, ______ purported class action lawsuits were
filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York
against Autoweb, some of Autoweb's current and former directors and officers and
the underwriters involved in Autoweb's initial public offering. The complaints
allege violations of the Securities Act of 1933 and of the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934 involving alleged undisclosed compensation to the underwriters and
seek unspecified damages. Also, Autobytel is a defendant in two state court
lawsuits described on page   . Autobytel and Autoweb believe that they have
meritorious defenses to the complaints and intend to vigorously defend the
actions; however, this and other litigation, even if not meritorious, could
result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and management attention
and an adverse outcome in litigation could materially affect the combined
companies' business, results of operations and financial condition.

IF AUTOBYTEL OR THE INTERNET INFRASTRUCTURE IS UNABLE TO HANDLE AN UNEXPECTEDLY
LARGE INCREASE IN VOLUME OF CONSUMERS USING AUTOBYTEL'S WEB SITES, AUTOBYTEL
CANNOT ASSURE ITS CONSUMERS OR DEALERS THAT PURCHASE REQUESTS WILL BE
EFFICIENTLY PROCESSED AND AUTOBYTEL'S POST-MERGER BUSINESS MAY SUFFER.

     If the Internet continues to experience significant growth in the number of
users and the level of use, then the Internet infrastructure may not be able to
continue to support the demands placed on it by such potential growth. The
Internet may not prove to be a viable commercial medium because of inadequate
development of the necessary infrastructure, timely development of complementary
products such as high speed modems, delays in the development or adoption of new
standards and protocols required to handle increased levels of Internet activity
or increased government regulation.

     An unexpectedly large increase in the volume or pace of traffic on
Autobytel's Web sites, including increases arising from the number of orders
placed by Autoweb customers, may require Autobytel to expand and further upgrade
Autobytel's technology, transaction-processing systems and network
infrastructure. Autobytel may not be able to accurately project the rate or
timing of increases, if any, in the use of its Web sites, including Autoweb Web
sites, or expand and upgrade Autobytel's systems and infrastructure

to accommodate such increases. In addition, Autobytel cannot assure that its
dealers will efficiently process purchase requests.

EVOLVING GOVERNMENT REGULATIONS MAY REQUIRE FUTURE LICENSING WHICH COULD
INCREASE ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS OR ADVERSELY AFFECT AUTOBYTEL'S REVENUES.

     In a regulatory climate that is uncertain, Autobytel's and Autoweb's
operations may be subject to direct and indirect adoption, expansion or
reinterpretation of various domestic and foreign laws and regulations.
Compliance with these future laws and regulations may require Autobytel to
obtain appropriate licenses at an undeterminable and possibly significant
initial monetary and annual expense. These additional monetary expenditures may
increase future overhead, thereby potentially reducing the combined companies'
future results of operations.

     Autobytel has identified what Autobytel believes are the areas of domestic
government regulation, which if changed, would be costly to the combined
companies. These laws and regulations include franchise laws, motor vehicle
brokerage licensing laws, insurance licensing laws, financial services law and
motor vehicle dealership licensing laws, which are or may be applicable to
aspects of Autobytel's business. There could be laws and regulations applicable
to the combined companies' business which Autobytel has not identified or which,
if changed, may be costly.

     The introduction of new services and expansion of Autobytel's operations to
foreign countries may require Autobytel to comply with additional, yet
undetermined, laws and regulations. Compliance may require obtaining appropriate
business licenses, filing of bonds, appointment of foreign agents and periodic
business reporting activity. The failure to adequately comply with these future
laws and regulations may delay or possibly prevent some of Autobytel's products
or services from being offered in a particular foreign country, thereby having
an adverse affect on the combined companies' results of operations.

CHANGING LEGISLATION IN THE AUTOMOTIVE INDUSTRY COULD REQUIRE INCREASED
REGULATORY AND LOBBYING COSTS AND MAY HARM THE COMBINED COMPANIES' BUSINESS.

     Autobytel's and Autoweb's purchasing services may result in changing the
way vehicles are sold which may be viewed as threatening by new and used vehicle
dealers who do not subscribe to Autobytel's or Autoweb's services. Such
businesses are often represented by influential lobbying organizations, and such
organizations or other persons may propose legislation which could impact the
evolving marketing and distribution model which Autobytel's or Autoweb's
services promote. Should current laws be changed or new laws passed, Autobytel's
business, results of operations and financial condition could be materially and
adversely affected. As Autobytel introduces new services, it may need to comply
with additional licensing regulations and regulatory requirements.

     To date, neither Autobytel nor Autoweb has spent significant resources on
lobbying or related government affairs issues but Autobytel may need to do so in
the future. A significant increase in the amount Autobytel spends on lobbying or
related activities would have a material adverse effect on the combined
companies' results of operations and financial condition.

IF FEDERAL OR STATE FRANCHISE LAWS APPLY TO THE COMBINED COMPANIES, THEY MAY BE
REQUIRED TO MODIFY OR ELIMINATE THEIR MARKETING PROGRAMS, WHICH MAY CAUSE THE
COMBINED COMPANIES' REVENUES TO DECREASE AND THEIR BUSINESS TO SUFFER.

     Autobytel believes that neither the combined companies' relationship with
their dealers nor their dealer subscription agreements constitute "franchises"
under federal or state franchise laws and that neither Autobytel nor Autoweb is
subject to the coverage of state motor vehicle dealer licensing laws. Through a
subsidiary, Autobytel is licensed as a motor vehicle dealer and broker. However,
if any state's regulatory requirements relating to franchises or Autobytel's or
the combined companies' method of business impose additional requirements on
them or include them within an industry-specific regulatory scheme, they may be
required to modify their marketing programs in such states in a manner which
undermines the programs' attractiveness to consumers or dealers. If the combined
companies become

subject to fines or other penalties or if they determine that the licensing and
related requirements are overly burdensome, they may elect to terminate
operations in such state. In each case, the combined companies' revenues may
decline and their business, results of operations and financial condition could
be materially and adversely affected.

     A federal court of appeals in Michigan has ruled that Autobytel's dealer
subscription agreement is not a "franchise" under Michigan law. However, if the
combined companies' relationship or written agreement with their dealers were
found to be a "franchise" under federal or state franchise laws, then Autobytel
could be subject to other regulations, such as franchise disclosure and
registration requirements and limitations on Autobytel's ability to effect
changes in their relationships with their dealers. Autobytel also believes that
Autobytel's and Autoweb's dealer marketing services do not qualify as an
automobile brokerage activity and, therefore, state broker licensing
requirements do not apply to Autobytel or Autoweb. Through a subsidiary,
Autobytel is licensed as a motor vehicle dealer and broker. In response to Texas
Department of Transportation concerns, Autobytel and Autoweb modified their
marketing programs in that state to include a pricing model under which all
dealers in Texas are charged uniform fees based on the population density of
their particular geographic area and to make their programs open to all dealers
who wish to apply.

IF FINANCIAL BROKER AND INSURANCE LICENSING REQUIREMENTS APPLY TO THE COMBINED
COMPANIES IN STATES WHERE THEY ARE NOT CURRENTLY LICENSED, THEY WILL BE REQUIRED
TO OBTAIN ADDITIONAL LICENSES AND THEIR BUSINESS MAY SUFFER.

     State regulatory requirements may include Autobytel or Autoweb within an
industry-specific regulatory scheme, such as those for vehicle insurance or
vehicle financing industries. In the event that individual states' regulatory
requirements change or additional requirements are imposed on the combined
company after the merger, Autobytel may be required to modify aspects of the
combined companies' business in those states in a manner that might undermine
the attractiveness of the purchase process to consumers, dealers, vehicle
manufacturers or advertisers or require Autobytel to terminate the combined
companies' operations in that state, either of which could have a material
adverse effect on the combined companies' business, results of operations and
financial condition.

     Autobytel provides a link on some of Autobytel's Web sites so consumers can
receive real time quotes for insurance coverage from Channelpoint Corporation
and submit quote applications online. Participants in the program include The
Hartford (Hartford Financial Services Group, Inc.), The GE Auto Insurance
Program and Ekemper. Autoweb has similar programs. Autobytel and Autoweb receive
fees from such participants in connection with this advertising activity.

     Autobytel does not believe that the above activities require Autobytel or
Autoweb to be licensed under state insurance laws. The use of the Internet in
the marketing of insurance products, however, is a relatively new practice. It
is not clear whether or to what extent state insurance licensing laws apply to
activities similar to Autobytel's or Autoweb's. Given these uncertainties,
Autobytel currently holds, through a wholly-owned subsidiary, insurance agent
licenses or is otherwise authorized to transact insurance in 47 states and the
District of Columbia.

     Due to the complexity, periodic modification and differing interpretations
of these laws, Autobytel or Autoweb may not always be in compliance with all of
these laws. Failure to comply with these numerous laws could result in fines,
additional licensing requirements or the revocation of Autobytel's license in a
particular jurisdiction or jurisdictions. These penalties could significantly
increase the combined companies' general operating expenses and harm their
business. In addition, even if the allegations in any regulatory action against
Autobytel or Autoweb turned out to be false, negative publicity relating to any
allegations could result in a loss of consumer confidence and significant damage
to Autobytel's brands. Autobytel believes that because many consumers and
insurance companies are not yet comfortable with the concept of purchasing
insurance online, the publicity relating to any regulatory or legal issues would
harm the combined companies' business.

     As a company that expects to offer its customers the opportunity to
purchase insurance over the Internet, Autobytel expects to be subject to
additional regulatory risks, as insurance regulations have not been fully
modified to cover Internet transactions. Currently, many state insurance
regulators are exploring the need for specific regulation of insurance sales
over the Internet. Any new regulation could dampen the growth of the Internet as
a means of providing insurance services. This could materially and adversely
affect the combined companies' business, results of operations and financial
condition.

THE PUBLIC MARKET FOR AUTOBYTEL'S COMMON STOCK MAY CONTINUE TO BE VOLATILE,
ESPECIALLY SINCE MARKET PRICES FOR INTERNET-RELATED AND TECHNOLOGY STOCKS HAVE
OFTEN BEEN UNRELATED TO OPERATING PERFORMANCE.

     Autobytel cannot assure that an active trading market will be sustained or
that the market price of its common stock will not decline.

     Recently, the stock market in general and the shares of Internet companies
in particular have experienced significant price fluctuations. The market price
of Autobytel's common stock is expected to continue to be highly volatile and
could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to factors such as:

     - actual or anticipated variations in Autobytel's annual or quarterly
       operating results;

     - Autobytel's historical and anticipated operating metrics such as the
       number of subscribing dealers, the visitors to Autobytel's Web sites and
       the frequency with which they transact;

     - announcements of new product or service offerings;

     - technological innovations;

     - competitive developments, including actions by automotive manufacturers;

     - changes in financial estimates by securities analysts;

     - conditions and trends in the Internet and electronic commerce industries;

     - adoption of new accounting standards affecting the technology or
       automotive industry; and

     - general market conditions and other factors.

     Further, the stock markets, and in particular the Nasdaq National Market on
which Autobytel's common stock is traded, have experienced extreme price and
volume fluctuations that have particularly affected the market prices of equity
securities of many technology companies and have often been unrelated or
disproportionate to the operating performance of such companies. These broad
market factors have and may continue to adversely affect the market price of
Autobytel's common stock. In addition, general economic, political and market
conditions such as recessions, interest rates or international currency
fluctuations, may adversely affect the market price of the common stock. In the
past, following periods of volatility in the market price of a company's
securities, securities class action litigation has often been instituted against
companies with publicly traded securities. Such litigation, if instituted, could
result in substantial costs and a diversion of management's attention and
resources, which would have a material adverse effect on Autobytel's business,
results of operations and financial condition.

IF AUTOBYTEL IS UNABLE TO MAINTAIN ITS NASDAQ NATIONAL MARKET LISTING, THE
LIQUIDITY OF AUTOBYTEL'S COMMON STOCK WOULD BE SERIOUSLY LIMITED.

     Autobytel cannot assure that it will be able to comply with the minimum bid
price requirement for continued listing on the Nasdaq National Market. In the
event Autobytel's shares are delisted from the Nasdaq National Market, Autobytel
anticipates that it would attempt to have its common stock traded on the NASD
over-the counter Bulletin Board. If Autobytel's common stock is delisted, it
would seriously limit the liquidity of its common stock and limit Autobytel's
potential to raise future capital through the sale of its common stock, which
could have a material adverse effect on Autobytel's business.

SALES OR THE PERCEPTION OF FUTURE SALES OF AUTOBYTEL'S COMMON STOCK MAY DEPRESS
AUTOBYTEL'S STOCK PRICE. SINCE THE MARKET PRICES FOR INTERNET-RELATED STOCKS ARE
LIKELY TO REMAIN VOLATILE, AUTOBYTEL'S STOCK PRICE MAY BE MORE ADVERSELY
AFFECTED THAN THE STOCK PRICE OF OTHER COMPANIES BY SUCH FUTURE SALES.

     Sale of substantial numbers of shares of common stock in the public market
could adversely affect the market price of Autobytel's common stock and make it
more difficult for Autobytel to raise funds through equity offerings in the
future. Of the [            ] shares of Autobytel common stock that were
outstanding as of [            ], 2001, approximately [            ] million
shares are eligible for sale in the public market without restriction and
approximately [            ] million shares are subject to restrictions on sale
in the public market in accordance with the provisions of Rule 144 under the
Securities Act of 1933. In addition, holders of approximately [     ] million
shares of common stock are entitled to certain registration rights with respect
to such shares until such time as the holders of such common stock may sell such
shares under Rule 144 of the Securities Act. There are approximately [     ]
million shares of Autoweb common stock that were outstanding on [       ] 2001.
If the merger were to be completed today, approximately [     ] million shares
of Autobytel common stock would be issued to the Autoweb shareholders, of which
approximately [     ] million shares would be subject to the volume limitations
of Rule 144 by virtue of Rule 145.

ADDITIONAL FACTORS TO CONSIDER IF THE MERGER IS NOT COMPLETED

     If the merger is not completed for any reason, Autoweb will be subject to a
number of material risks, including:

     - the provision in the merger agreement that Autoweb could be required to
       pay Autobytel a termination fee of up to $1 million and/or that Autoweb
       could be required to reimburse Autobytel for costs and expenses incurred
       in connection with the merger;

     - the market price of Autoweb common stock may decline to the extent that
       the current market price of such shares may reflect a market assumption
       that the merger will be completed;

     - costs related to the merger, such as legal and accounting fees and a
       portion of the investment banking fees, must be paid even if the merger
       is not completed;

     - benefits that Autoweb expects to realize from the merger, such as the
       potentially enhanced financial and competitive position of the combined
       companies, would not be realized;

     - the diversion of management attention from day-to-day business, and the
       potential to disrupt employees and relationships with customers and
       dealers during the period before consummation of the merger, may affect
       the financial and market position of Autoweb if the merger does not
       occur; and

     - if the merger is terminated and the Autoweb board of directors seeks
       another merger or business combination, Autoweb stockholders cannot be
       certain that Autoweb will be able to find a partner willing to pay an
       equivalent or more attractive price than the price to be paid by
       Autobytel in the merger.

     Additionally, failing to complete the merger could adversely affect
Autoweb's continued listing on the Nasdaq National Market.

     In considering these factors, stockholders should be aware that either
Autobytel or Autoweb can terminate the merger for various reasons, as discussed
on page   .

        UNAUDITED PRO FORMA CONSOLIDATED CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

OVERVIEW

     On April 11, 2001, Autobytel entered into an agreement to acquire Autoweb
in a merger transaction. As part of the merger, a separately formed Delaware
corporation, Autobytel Acquisition I Corp., will be merged with and into
Autoweb. The separate corporate existence of Autobytel Acquisition I Corp. shall
cease and Autoweb will continue as the surviving corporation and become a wholly
owned subsidiary of Autobytel.

     The accompanying unaudited pro forma consolidated condensed balance sheet
assumes that the merger took place as of March 31, 2001. The unaudited pro forma
consolidated condensed balance sheet combines the unaudited consolidated balance
sheet of Autobytel as of March 31, 2001 and the unaudited balance sheet of
Autoweb as of March 31, 2001.

     The accompanying unaudited pro forma consolidated condensed statements of
operations present the consolidated statement of operations of Autobytel for the
three months ended March 31, 2001 and the audited statement of operations for
the year ended December 31, 2000 combined with Autoweb's unaudited statement of
operations for the three months ended March 31, 2001 and audited statement of
operations for the year ended December 31, 2000. The unaudited pro forma
consolidated condensed statements of operations give effect to the merger as if
it had occurred as of January 1, 2000.

     The unaudited pro forma consolidated condensed balance sheet and statements
of operations are not necessarily indicative of the financial position and
operating results that would have been achieved had the transaction been in
effect as of the dates indicated and should not be construed as being a
representation of the financial position or future operating results of the
combined company.

     The unaudited pro forma consolidated condensed financial information should
be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and
related notes of Autobytel and Autoweb included elsewhere in this joint proxy
statement/prospectus.

THE MERGER

     The merger will be structured as a stock-for-stock exchange. Autobytel will
issue 0.3553 shares of Autobytel common stock, par value $0.001 per share, for
each share of Autoweb common stock outstanding as of the effective date of the
merger. The merger is expected to be accounted for as an acquisition under the
purchase method of accounting for business combinations with an estimated
purchase price of $16.3 million.

     The pro forma adjustments are based on currently available information and
certain assumptions that Autobytel's management believes are reasonable. Pro
forma adjustments for the merger include:

     - The preliminary purchase price allocation based on management's current
       estimates of the fair realizable value of Autoweb's net assets, based on
       the estimated 10.5 million shares of Autobytel common stock to be issued
       which are valued at $14.3 million and the $2 million transaction costs
       paid by Autobytel for a total estimated value of $16.3 million.

     - The incurrence of approximately $4.2 million in estimated combined
       transaction costs, including investment banking, legal, accounting and
       registration fees.

     - The elimination of unamortized goodwill recorded by Autoweb from previous
       acquisitions.

     - The estimated exit costs of anticipated facilities integration, personnel
       costs, and other expenses directly related to the contemplated
       consolidation of significant operations of the merged companies.

     Management expects that the strategic benefits of the merger will result in
incremental revenue and expense saving opportunities for the combined companies.
Those opportunities include, but are not limited to, the ability to
cross-promote the combined companies' products and services, the ability to
offer consumers an expanded array of services and the ability to service the
broader customer base in a more

cost effective manner. However, such incremental revenues and cost savings have
not been reflected in the accompanying pro forma consolidated condensed
statements of operations presented herein.

     Under the purchase method of accounting, the estimated cost of
approximately $16.3 million to acquire Autoweb, including transaction costs
incurred by Autobytel, will be allocated to its underlying net assets in
proportion to their respective fair values. Any excess of the purchase price
over the estimated fair value of the net assets acquired will be recorded as
goodwill. A preliminary allocation of the excess of the purchase price,
including transaction costs, over the book value of the net assets to be
acquired has been made to goodwill.

     At this time, the work needed to provide the basis for estimating these
fair values and the related amortization period has not been completed. As a
result, the final allocation of the excess purchase price over the book value of
the net assets acquired could differ materially. The pro forma consolidated
condensed financial statements reflect a preliminary allocation to goodwill
assuming a weighted-average amortization period of fifteen years. The final
purchase price allocation may result in a different weighted-average
amortization period than that presented. Accordingly, a change in the
amortization period would impact the amount of annual amortization expense.

       NOTES TO THE PRO FORMA CONSOLIDATED CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
                                  (UNAUDITED)

(a) Reflects the historical financial position of Autobytel as of March 31,
    2001.

(b) Reflects the historical financial position of Autoweb as of March 31, 2001.

(c) Pro forma adjustments to record the merger as of March 31, 2001 reflect:

     - an increase in stockholders' equity of approximately $14.3 million
       relating to the issuance of approximately 10.5 million shares of
       Autobytel's common stock, based on an exchange ratio of 1 to 0.3553. The
       Autobytel common stock to be issued was valued based on a price per share
       of $1.36, which was the average market price for three days before and
       after the date the acquisition agreement was announced,

     - an increase in accounts receivable allowance for doubtful accounts of
       approximately $1.0 million as a result of conforming from Autoweb's
       policy to Autobytel's,

     - a decrease in property and equipment of $1.7 million relating to the
       adjustment to estimated fair market value,

     - an increase in accrued expenses of approximately $4.2 million relating to
       the incurrence of transaction costs, including investment banking, legal,
       accounting and registration fees,

     - an increase in accrued expenses of $9.2 million primarily relating to the
       estimated exit costs contemplated in conjunction with the consolidation
       of operations and integration of facilities,

     - the elimination of approximately $10.1 million of Autoweb's pre-existing
       goodwill,

     - the preliminary allocation of $2.0 million to goodwill which is equal to
       the excess of the $16.3 million purchase price, including transaction
       costs, over the book value of the net assets acquired and,

     - a decrease in stockholders' equity of approximately $24.2 million
       relating to the elimination of Autoweb's historical shareholders' equity.

     The final allocation of the purchase price will be determined after the
completion of the merger and will be based on a comprehensive final evaluation
of the fair value of the tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired
and liabilities assumed at the time of the merger. The preliminary allocation is
summarized as follows (in millions):

Purchase price:
  Common stock..............................................  $14.3
  Transaction costs paid by Autobytel.......................    2.0

(d) Reflects the historical operating results of Autobytel for the three months
    ended March 31, 2001 and the year ended December 31, 2000.

(e) Reflects the historical operating results of Autoweb for the three months
    ended March 31, 2001 and the year ended December 31, 2000, including various
    reclassifications that have been made to conform Autoweb to Autobytel's
    consolidated condensed financial statement presentation.

(f) Pro forma adjustments to record the merger for the three months ended March
    31, 2001 and the year ended December 31, 2000 to reflect:

     - Increases of $34,000 and $136,000, respectively, in the amortization of
       goodwill relating to the excess of the purchase price to acquire Autoweb
       over the book value of its net assets acquired, which has been allocated
       to goodwill and is being amortized on a straight-line basis over a 15
       year weighted-average period;

     - Decreases of $1.8 million and $7.0 million, respectively, in the
       amortization of goodwill and other intangible assets relating to the
       elimination of Autoweb's pre-existing goodwill and other intangible
       assets,

     - Increases of $16,000 and $62,000 respectively, in depreciation of fixed
       assets acquired and,

     - Decreases of $496,000 and $1.9 million, respectively, in the depreciation
       of fixed assets resulting from an adjustment to the estimated fair market
       value.

     In addition, pro forma net loss per common share has been adjusted to
reflect the issuance of additional shares of Autobytel common stock in the
merger based on Autobytel's weighted average shares outstanding for the periods
presented and an exchange ratio of 1 to 0.3553. Because the effect of stock
options would be antidilutive, dilutive per share amounts on a pro forma basis
are the same as basic per share amounts.

                           COMPARATIVE PER SHARE DATA

     The following table reflects (a) the historical net loss and book value per
share of Autobytel common stock and the historical net loss and book value per
share of Autoweb common stock in comparison with the unaudited pro forma net
loss and book value per share after giving effect to Autobytel's proposed merger
with Autoweb, and (b) the equivalent historical net loss and book value per
share attributable to 0.3553 shares of Autobytel common stock which will be
received for each share of Autoweb common stock.

     The historical book value per share is computed by dividing stockholders'
equity as of March 31, 2001 and December 31, 2000, by the actual common stock
outstanding. The pro forma per share loss from continuing operations is computed
by dividing the pro forma loss from continuing operations by the pro forma
weighted average number of shares outstanding, assuming Autobytel had merged
with Autoweb at the beginning of the earliest period presented. The pro forma
combined book value per share is computed by dividing total pro forma
stockholders' equity by the pro forma number of common shares outstanding at
March 31, 2001 and December 31, 2000 assuming the merger had occurred on January
1, 2000. The Autoweb equivalent pro forma combined per share amounts are
calculated by multiplying the Autobytel pro forma combined per share amounts by
the exchange ratio of 0.3553.

     The following information should be read in conjunction with the separate
audited historical consolidated financial statements and related notes of
Autobytel and Autoweb, the unaudited pro forma consolidated condensed financial
information and related notes of Autobytel and the selected historical and
selected unaudited pro forma financial data included elsewhere in this joint
proxy statement/prospectus. The pro forma information is presented for
illustrative purposes only and is not necessarily indicative of the operating
results or financial position that would have occurred if the merger of Autoweb
had been consummated as of the beginning of the earliest period presented, nor
is it necessarily indicative of the future operating results or financial
position of the combined company.

     Autoweb stockholders are advised to obtain current market quotations for
Autobytel common stock and Autoweb common stock. No assurance can be given as to
the market prices of Autobytel common stock or Autoweb common stock at any time
before the consummation of the merger or as to the market price of Autobytel
common stock at any time after the merger. Because the exchange ratio is fixed,
the exchange ratio will not be adjusted to compensate Autoweb stockholders for
decreases in the market price of Autobytel common stock which have and could
occur further before the merger becomes effective. In the event the market price
of Autobytel common stock decreases or increases prior to the consummation of
the merger, the value of the Autobytel common stock to be received in the merger
in exchange for Autoweb common stock would correspondingly decrease or increase.

DIVIDENDS

     Neither Autobytel nor Autoweb has ever declared or paid cash dividends on
its capital stock. Pursuant to the acquisition agreement, each of Autobytel and
Autoweb has agreed not to pay cash dividends pending the consummation of the
merger without the prior written consent of the other. If the merger is not
consummated, the Autoweb board anticipates that it would continue its policy of
retaining any and all earnings to finance the expansion of its business.
Autobytel expects to retain any and all future earnings for use in the operation
and expansion of its business and does not anticipate paying any cash dividends
before or after the merger.

                                   THE MERGER

     This section of the joint proxy statement/prospectus describes the proposed
merger. While Autobytel and Autoweb believe that the description covers the
material terms of the merger and the related transactions, this summary may not
contain all of the information that is important to you. You should carefully
read this entire document and the other documents Autobytel and Autoweb refer to
for a more complete understanding of the merger and the related transactions.

BACKGROUND OF THE MERGER

     In light of the rapid changes in the automotive online commerce and
interactive services industries, it had become regular practice of the board of
directors of both Autobytel and Autoweb to review periodically with senior
management the relative position of each company in these industries, changes in
the competitive landscape and technology as well as strategic alternatives
available to each company in order to remain competitive and enhance stockholder
value. In connection with this ongoing review of long-term strategic plans, each
company has been considering a wide range of strategic options, including
internal growth strategies, growth through various strategic alliances,
investments, acquisitions or business combinations. In furtherance of these
objectives, from time to time each company has had contact with various parties
to explore on a preliminary basis several of these alternatives, including some
discussions with one or more parties during the time periods described below.

     During the course of the prior year, various senior management personnel of
Autobytel have been involved from time to time in discussions with members of
senior management of Autoweb regarding a variety of topics related to their
businesses, including a possible business combination.

     During a meeting in Menlo Park, California on June 30, 2000, between Mark
Lorimer, President and Chief Executive Officer of Autobytel, and Dean DeBiase,
Chairman of Autoweb, the parties raised the possibility that Autoweb and
Autobytel might explore a possible business combination.

     On July 28, 2000, Mr. Lorimer and Dennis Benner, Executive Vice President,
Corporate Development of Autobytel, met with Mr. DeBiase and Jeffrey Schwartz,
then the Vice President of Strategic Development of Autoweb, in Irvine,
California and discussed the possibility of a business combination.

     In September and early October of 2000, Mr. DeBiase spoke by phone several
times with Mr. Lorimer and discussed the general terms of a possible transaction
and outlined business integration issues that would have to be analyzed. During
these conversations, Mr. Lorimer indicated that Autobytel was interested in
continuing discussions regarding a strategic business combination with Autoweb.

     On October 8 and October 31, 2000, the Autoweb board of directors held
meetings to discuss potential sources of new capital for Autoweb and potential
strategic partners. During each meeting the board of directors also discussed a
range of economic and operational issues that would have to be resolved in any
transaction between Autoweb and Autobytel. The Autoweb board of directors
authorized Messrs. DeBiase and Schwartz and other members of Autoweb's senior
management to pursue further discussions with Autobytel.

     On November 2, 2000, Autobytel and Autoweb entered into a mutual
non-disclosure agreement.

     On November 6, 2000, Messrs. DeBiase and Schwartz, now Chief Executive
Officer and President of Autoweb, discussed the advantages and disadvantages of

discuss potential strategic transactions, including a business combination,

DeBiase and Schwartz had several telephone conversations with Mr. Lorimer
regarding potential strategic transactions, including a business combination
with Autobytel.

     On November 15, 2000, the Autoweb board of directors held a special
telephonic meeting to discuss a possible transaction with Autobytel. The Autoweb
board discussed the possible advantages and risks of a strategic business
combination with Autobytel. Following this discussion, Autoweb's board of
directors authorized management to continue discussions with Autobytel regarding
a possible strategic business combination.

     During November 2000, Mr. Lorimer discussed with various individual board
members of Autobytel the advantages and disadvantages of a business combination
with Autoweb. During such month, members of senior management of Autobytel met
with representatives of Lehman Brothers to evaluate a potential business
combination with Autoweb.

     On December 6, 2000, Messrs. DeBiase and Schwartz and Mr. Michael Schmidt,
Chief Financial Officer of Autoweb, and Ms. Meri E. Glade, Vice President, Legal
Affairs and General Counsel of Autoweb, met with representatives of Credit
Suisse First Boston, Autoweb's financial advisors. At this meeting
representatives of Autoweb discussed certain potential strategic transactions
with representatives of Credit Suisse First Boston, including a possible
business combination with Autobytel.

     On December 8, 2000, the board of directors of Autobytel held a regular
meeting during which Mr. Lorimer reported on discussions with representatives of
Autoweb regarding a proposed business combination.

     On December 12 and 15, 2000, Messrs. Schwartz, DeBiase and Schmidt phoned
Mr. Lorimer and Amit Kothari, Controller and then Interim Chief Financial
Officer of Autobytel, to discuss the financial models of each company and the
possibility of a business combination transaction between the two companies.

     During the period from December 20, 2000 through January 23, 2001, there
were telephone calls between various members of senior management of Autoweb and
Autobytel regarding the structure of a potential transaction, potential
synergies, management and corporate governance issues, the appropriate exchange
ratio, certain due diligence issues and Autoweb's relationships with certain
marketing partners.

     On January 10, 2001, the Autoweb board of directors held a special

Autobytel to the Autoweb board of directors. Ms. Glade participated in the
meeting and reviewed various items with the Autoweb board of directors,
including the board of directors' fiduciary duties in considering strategic
alternatives to the transaction with Autobytel. The Autoweb board of directors
further discussed the possible advantages and risks of a strategic business
combination with Autobytel. Following this discussion, the board of directors
authorized management to continue with negotiations and due diligence regarding
a proposed business combination with Autobytel.

     From January 23, 2001 through February 2, 2001, representatives of
Autobytel and Autoweb met to continue discussions regarding a potential
transaction. Among other things, they discussed each company's business,
operations and personnel and other integration issues. On February 2, 2001,

regarding a potential transaction.

     On February 4, 2001, Mr. Schwartz and William Barrett, President of AIC, a
division of Autoweb, and Dr. Nadyne Edison, Chief Marketing Officer of Autoweb,
met with Mr. Lorimer and Andrew Donchak, Chief Marketing Officer of Autobytel,
to discuss certain management issues, operations and other post-merger
integration matters.

     On February 7, 2001, the board of directors of Autobytel held a regular
meeting during which Mr. Lorimer reported on discussions with representatives of
Autoweb regarding the proposed business combination. During such meeting,
representatives of Lehman Brothers presented a preliminary financial analysis
and valuation of a possible transaction between Autoweb and Autobytel. The
Autobytel board of directors discussed the possible advantages and disadvantages
of a business combination with Autoweb. Following the discussion, the Autobytel
board of directors instructed management to continue to proceed with
negotiations and due diligence regarding a proposed business combination with
Autoweb.

     Beginning the week of February 12, 2001, there were numerous telephone
calls between members of senior management of Autoweb and members of senior
management of Autobytel and their respective financial advisors and outside
legal counsel regarding the terms of the proposed transaction and certain due
diligence matters.

     On February 28, 2001, legal counsel to Autobytel distributed to Autoweb and
its counsel the initial draft of a proposed form of acquisition agreement. From
February 28 through April 10, 2001, representatives of each company, including
legal and financial advisors, performed due diligence and negotiated the terms
of the acquisition agreement and related agreements.

     On March 7, 2001, representatives of Credit Suisse First Boston met with
certain members of Autobytel management to conduct further due diligence.

     On March 12, 2001, the Autoweb board of directors held a special telephonic

Goodrich & Rosati identified certain unresolved issues relating to the proposed
transaction and the acquisition agreement.

     On March 19, 2001, the Autobytel board of directors held a special

updated the Autoweb board of directors on their respective discussions with
representatives of Autobytel's financial and legal advisors. Mr. Schwartz
reviewed the status of negotiations and due diligence with the Autoweb board of
directors. The Autoweb board of directors then authorized and instructed
management to continue negotiations and due diligence with respect to the
transaction.

     On March 29, 2001, the Autobytel board of directors held a special
telephonic meeting to consider the proposed transaction. Prior to the meeting,
the directors were provided with a draft of the acquisition agreement and
related documents. A representative of Paul, Hastings, Janofsky & Walker LLP and
Autobytel's General Counsel summarized the principal terms of the proposed
agreements. Representatives of Lehman Brothers discussed with the Autobytel
board of directors certain financial analyses of the acquisition, and delivered
the oral opinion of Lehman Brothers to the effect that, based on and subject to
matters set forth in its written opinion, as of March 29, 2001 the consideration
to be paid by Autobytel in the proposed transaction was fair, from a financial
point of view, to Autobytel. In light of the prior discussions among members of
the Autobytel board of directors, the prior meetings of the Autobytel board of
directors and the presentations and discussions at the current meeting, the
Autobytel board of directors determined by unanimous vote that the transactions
contemplated by the acquisition agreement and related documents were advisable

financial analyses of the acquisition and delivered the oral opinion of Credit
Suisse First Boston, subsequently confirmed in writing, to the effect that,
based on and subject to matters set forth in its opinion, as of March 31, 2001,
the exchange ratio pursuant to the acquisition agreement was fair from a
financial point of view to holders of Autoweb common stock. In light of the
prior discussions among members of the Autoweb board of directors, the prior
meetings of the Autoweb board of directors and the presentations and discussions
at the current meeting, the Autoweb board of directors determined by unanimous
vote that the transactions contemplated by the acquisition agreement and related
documents were advisable and in the best interests of Autoweb and its
stockholders and, contingent on the resolution of remaining due diligence
matters and finalization of agreements related to the acquisition, unanimously
approved the acquisition agreement and the merger and related documents.

     From March 31 to April 10, 2001, Autobytel and Autoweb negotiated the final
terms of the definitive acquisition agreement and related documents, including
an employment agreement for Mr. Schwartz and a voting agreement with significant
stockholders of Autoweb.

     The acquisition agreement and voting agreement were signed by the parties
on April 11, 2001, and Autobytel and Autoweb issued a joint press release
announcing the transaction.

AUTOBYTEL'S REASONS FOR THE MERGER

     At a meeting held on March 29, 2001, the board of directors of Autobytel
concluded that the merger was in the best interests of Autobytel and its
stockholders and determined to recommend that the Autobytel stockholders approve
the issuance of the shares of Autobytel common stock in the merger. In its
evaluation of the merger, the Autobytel board identified several potential
benefits of the merger, the most important of which included the board's
expectation that:

     - by combining its operations with Autoweb, Autobytel would be better
       positioned to broaden its customer base, accelerate its revenue growth
       and extend its position as a leading provider of automotive internet
       services;

     - by obtaining AIC's capabilities, the combined company would save data and
       licensing costs that Autobytel presently pays to third parties and would
       be better able to provide data content, technology and information
       services to automotive marketers on a global basis;

     - the merger would enable Autobytel to realize significant operating
       synergies, including reduced corporate overhead and the consolidation of
       sales and marketing organizations;

     - Autoweb's cash reserves would enable Autobytel to partially fund the
       anticipated ongoing operating losses incurred by Autoweb until cost
       reductions could be implemented; and

     - the combined companies would be able to employ the best practices and
       processes of each of Autobytel and Autoweb in future operations.

     Autobytel's board of directors consulted with senior management, as well as
its legal counsel and financial advisors, in reaching the decision to approve
the merger. In its evaluation of the merger, the Autobytel board reviewed
several factors, including:

     - information concerning the business, financial condition, operations,
       competitive position and prospects of Autobytel and Autoweb both
       individually and on a combined basis including the compatibility of the
       two companies' operations;

     - analyses and other information with respect to Autobytel and Autoweb
       including consideration of the strategic focus of the combined companies
       and the likelihood of their ability to compete successfully;

     - the possibility, as an alternative to the merger, of seeking to acquire a
       different company or establish other strategic alliances;

     - the cash position of the combined companies, especially during periods of
       volatility in the financial markets;

     - the opinion of Lehman Brothers to the Autobytel board of directors, to
       the effect that, based on and subject to matters set forth in its
       opinion, as of March 29, 2001, the consideration to be paid by Autobytel
       in the proposed transaction was fair, from a financial point of view, to
       Autobytel. The opinion of Lehman Brothers is described below under
       "Opinion of Autobytel's Financial Advisor";

     - the amount and form of the consideration to be received by Autoweb's
       stockholders in the merger in light of comparable transactions and the
       historical market prices, volatility and trading information for
       Autoweb's common stock and Autobytel's common stock;

     - that Autobytel's stockholders would hold approximately 66% of the
       outstanding common stock of the combined company after the merger;

     - the expectation that the merger would qualify as a tax-free
       reorganization;

     - the financial and other terms and conditions of the merger and the
       acquisition agreement;

     - the belief by Autobytel's senior management that the terms of the
       acquisition agreement are reasonable;

     - the potential impact of the merger on Autobytel's and Autoweb's customers
       and employees; and

     - discussions with Autobytel's management and legal and financial advisors
       as to the results of the due diligence investigation of Autoweb.

     The Autobytel board of directors also identified and considered a number of
potentially negative factors in its deliberations concerning the merger,
including the following:

     - the risk that the potential benefits of the merger may not be realized or
       may be delayed;

     - the costs associated with the merger, including merger related
       transaction costs, costs for disposing of real estate leases and costs
       for renegotiating or terminating marketing and equipment agreements;

     - the difficulty of integrating Autoweb with Autobytel and the management
       effort and costs required to complete the integration following the
       merger, including:

      - the difficulty of maintaining a consistent brand image given certain
        differences in the companies' respective business models;

      - potential difficulties in providing Autoweb customers with the requisite
        level of service in the post-merger transition; and,

      - given the importance of operating the combined companies on a common
        technology platform, possible difficulties associated with migrating
        Autoweb's operations to the Autobytel technology platform;

     - the possibility that the merger may not be consummated, even though it
       has been approved by Autobytel's and Autoweb's boards of directors;

     - the negative effect that treating the merger, for accounting purposes, as
       a "purchase," will have on the combined company's future earnings per
       share, due to amortization of "goodwill";

     - the risk that the premium offered relative to Autoweb's current stock
       price may not be viewed favorably by the market;

     - the impact of the accelerated vesting for certain Autoweb employees'
       stock options after a change in control of Autoweb and after such
       employees' termination; and

     - the other applicable risks described in this joint proxy
       statement/prospectus under "Risk Factors" beginning on page 8.

     The Autobytel board of directors concluded however, that, on balance, the
potential benefits to Autobytel and its stockholders in the merger outweighed
the risks associated with the merger. The discussion of the information and
factors considered by the Autobytel board of directors is not intended to be
exhaustive. In view of the variety of factors considered in connection with its
evaluation of the merger, the Autobytel board of directors did not find it
practicable to, and did not quantify or otherwise assign relative weight to, the
specific factors considered in reaching its determination.

AUTOWEB'S REASONS FOR THE MERGER

     On March 31, 2001, the board of directors of Autoweb unanimously (a)
determined that the proposed merger was consistent with and in furtherance of
the long-term business strategy of Autoweb and fair to, and in the best
interests of, Autoweb and its stockholders; and (b) approved the acquisition
agreement and the other transactions contemplated by the acquisition agreement,
contingent on the resolution of remaining due diligence matters and finalization
of agreements related to the acquisition. In reaching its decision to approve
the acquisition agreement and the merger and to recommend adoption of the
acquisition agreement by Autoweb stockholders, the Autoweb board of directors
consulted with its management team and advisors and independently considered the
proposed merger, acquisition agreement and the transactions contemplated by the
acquisition agreement. The board of directors of Autoweb has unanimously
recommended that the Autoweb shareholders vote FOR the approval and adoption of
the acquisition agreement and the proposed merger. The Autoweb board of
directors identified several potential benefits of the merger, including the
board of directors' expectation that:

     - Given the complementary nature of the technologies and business
       strategies of Autoweb and Autobytel, Autoweb's strategic objectives would
       be significantly furthered by the proposed merger, and as a result,
       Autoweb would be better positioned to reach these objectives than it
       would as a stand alone company. Autoweb's strategic objectives include
       expanding its customer base and expanding its content and service
       offerings. In this regard, the Autoweb board of directors believes that
       the merger will result in creation of the most comprehensive online
       automobile-related destination for customers, content and services.

     - The combined company will have a stronger financial position.

     - The merger will provide current and potential advertising companies,
       automobile manufacturers, dealers and other Autoweb customers with
       increased access to a larger, more targeted and desirable demographic
       group on the Internet.

     - The merger will result in a combined company that ranks among the largest
       online automobile related Web site networks worldwide, which will create
       greater brand recognition and may attract more customers.

     - The combined company will be able to take advantage of significant
       operating synergies, including reduced corporate overhead expenses and
       the consolidation of sales and marketing organizations.

     - The exchange ratio proposed by Autobytel represented, as of the signing
       of the acquisition agreement, consideration having a value, based upon
       the closing price of $1.49 per share of Autobytel common stock on April
       10, 2001 on Nasdaq National Market (the trading day preceding the date of
       the public announcement of the proposed merger), of $0.53 per share. This
       value represented a premium of approximately 83% over $0.29, the closing
       price per Autoweb common stock on April 10, 2001 on Nasdaq National
       Market.

     - Autoweb's stockholders will hold approximately 34% of the outstanding
       common stock of the combined company after the merger which will provide
       Autoweb's stockholders with the opportunity to share in the combined
       companies' long-term growth which the Autoweb board of directors believed
       would not be as achievable as a stand-alone company.

     - The opinion of Autoweb's financial advisor, Credit Suisse First Boston,
       dated March 31, 2001 as to the fairness, from a financial point of view
       to holders of Autoweb common stock and as of the date

of the opinion, of the exchange ratio provided for in the acquisition agreement,
as more fully described below under the caption "Opinion of Autoweb's Financial
Advisor".

     - The expectation that the merger will qualify as a tax-free
       reorganization.

     Autoweb's board of directors consulted with senior management, as well as
its legal counsel and financial advisors, in reaching a decision to approve the
merger. In its evaluation of the merger, the Autoweb board of directors reviewed
several other factors, including:

     - Information concerning the financial condition, business, operations,
       strategic objectives and prospects and competitive position of Autoweb
       and Autobytel before and after giving effect to the merger.

     - Current market conditions and industry trends affecting Autoweb,
       Autobytel and Internet business-to-business and business-to-consumer
       companies in general.

     - Current financial market conditions and historical market prices of
       Autoweb and Autobytel's common stock.

     - Volatility and trading information with respect to Autoweb common stock
       and Autobytel common stock.

     - Autoweb's capital requirements and its ability to attract additional
       capital or financing, if required.

     - A comparison of comparable merger transactions.

     - The impact of the merger on the advertisers, sponsors, customers and
       employees of Autoweb and Autobytel.

     - The terms and conditions of the acquisition agreement and related
       agreements.

     Autoweb's board of directors also identified and considered, among others,
a number of potentially negative factors in its deliberations concerning the
merger and the acquisition agreement, including the following:

     - The risk that the potential benefits of the merger may not be realized.

     - The potential challenges of integrating Autobytel's operations with those
       of Autoweb.

     - The effect of public announcement of the merger and the possibility the
       merger may not be consummated on the demand for Autoweb's products and
       services and relationships with customers and strategic partners,
       including the potential adverse consequences of employee retention
       associated with providing the notification of possible terminations
       required under the WARN Act.

     - The financial and other terms and conditions of the merger and the
       acquisition agreement including:

      - the non-solicitation and other protective provisions that may have the
        effect of discouraging other persons potentially interested in acquiring
        Autoweb from pursuing such an opportunity as more fully described under
        "The Acquisition Agreement -- No Solicitation by Autoweb".

      - the likelihood that the stockholders of Autoweb and Autobytel may not
        vote to approve and adopt the acquisition agreement and to approve the
        merger;

      - that, while the merger is likely to be completed, there are risks
        associated with certain conditions to the completion of the merger, and
        it is possible that the merger may not be completed even if approved by
        the stockholders of Autoweb and Autobytel; and

      - the costs to Autoweb due to fees payable in the event the acquisition
        agreement is terminated under certain circumstances.

     - Other applicable risks described in this joint proxy statement/prospectus
       under "Risk Factors" beginning on page 8.

     This discussion of the information and factors considered by Autoweb's
board is not intended to be exhaustive, but includes the material factors
considered. In view of the number and wide variety of factors considered in
connection with its evaluation of the merger, and the complexity of these
matters, the Autoweb board of directors did not find it practicable to, nor did
it attempt to, quantify, rank or otherwise assign relative weights to the
specific factors it considered. In addition, the Autoweb board of directors did
not undertake to make any specific determination as to whether any particular
factor was favorable or unfavorable to its ultimate determination or assign any
particular weight to any factor, but conducted an overall analysis of the
factors described above, including thorough discussions with and questioning of
Autoweb's management and management's analysis of the proposed merger based on
information received from Autoweb's legal, financial and accounting advisors. In
considering the factors described above, individual members of the board of
directors may have given different weight to different factors. Autoweb's board
of directors considered all these factors together and concluded that the risks
were outweighed by the potential benefits of the merger.

     For the reasons discussed above, Autoweb's board of directors has approved
the merger and the transactions contemplated by the acquisition agreement and
has determined that the merger and the transactions contemplated by the
acquisition agreement are advisable and fair to and in the best interests of
Autoweb and its stockholders, and recommends that Autoweb stockholders vote for
approval of the merger and the transactions contemplated by the acquisition
agreement.

OPINION OF AUTOBYTEL'S FINANCIAL ADVISOR

     Autobytel engaged Lehman Brothers to render its opinion with respect to the
fairness, from a financial point of view, to Autobytel of the consideration to
be paid by Autobytel in the proposed merger. On March 29, 2001, Lehman Brothers
rendered its opinion, that as of such date and, based on and subject to certain
matters stated therein, from a financial point of view, the consideration to be
paid by Autobytel in the proposed merger was fair to Autobytel. Based upon the
conversion ratio of Autobytel common stock for Autoweb's common stock of 0.3553,
the total consideration consisted of 34% of the stock of the combined company.

THE FULL TEXT OF LEHMAN BROTHERS' WRITTEN OPINION DATED MARCH 29, 2001 IS
ATTACHED AS ANNEX B TO THIS JOINT PROXY STATEMENT/PROSPECTUS (THE "LEHMAN
OPINION") AND IS INCORPORATED HEREIN BY REFERENCE. STOCKHOLDERS MAY READ THE
LEHMAN OPINION FOR A DISCUSSION OF ASSUMPTIONS MADE, MATTERS CONSIDERED AND
LIMITATIONS ON THE REVIEW UNDERTAKEN BY LEHMAN BROTHERS IN RENDERING ITS
OPINION. THE FOLLOWING IS A SUMMARY OF THE LEHMAN OPINION AND THE METHODOLOGY
THAT LEHMAN BROTHERS USED TO RENDER ITS FAIRNESS OPINION.

     The Lehman Opinion was provided for the information and assistance of the
Autobytel board of directors in connection with its consideration of the
proposed merger. The Lehman Opinion is not intended to be and does not
constitute a recommendation to any stockholder as to how such stockholder should
vote on the proposed merger. Lehman Brothers was not requested to opine as to,
and the Lehman Opinion does not in any matter address, (1) Autobytel's
underlying business decision to proceed with or effect the proposed merger, or
(2) any part of the proposed merger on a separate basis. The consideration to be
paid in the proposed merger was determined through arm's length negotiations
between Autobytel and Autoweb, and was approved by the Autobytel board of
directors. Lehman Brothers neither provided advice to the Autobytel board of
directors during such negotiations nor recommended any specific consideration to
the Autobytel board of directors or that any specific consideration would
constitute the only appropriate consideration for the proposed merger.

     In arriving at its opinion, Lehman Brothers reviewed and analyzed:

     - the draft acquisition agreement and the specific terms of the proposed
       merger;

     - publicly available information concerning Autobytel that Lehman Brothers
       believed to be relevant to its analysis, including Autobytel's Annual
       Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 1999,
       Autobytel's Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for the quarters ended March
       31,

       June 30, and September 30, 2000 and Autobytel's earnings release for the
       quarter and fiscal year ended December 31, 2000;

     - financial and operating information with respect to the business,
       operations and prospects of Autobytel furnished to Lehman Brothers by
       Autobytel;

     - publicly available information concerning Autoweb that Lehman Brothers
       believed to be relevant to its analysis, including Autoweb's Annual
       Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 1999,
       Autoweb's Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for the quarters ended March 31,
       June 30, and September 30, 2000 and Autoweb's earnings release for the
       quarter and fiscal year ended December 31, 2000;

     - financial and operating information with respect to the business,
       operations and prospects of Autoweb furnished to Lehman Brothers by
       Autoweb and Autobytel;

     - a comparison of the historical financial results and present financial
       condition of Autoweb and Autobytel with those of other companies that
       Lehman Brothers deemed relevant;

     - the potential pro forma financial effects of the combination of the
       businesses of Autobytel and Autoweb, including the cost savings,
       operating synergies and strategic benefits expected by the managements of
       Autobytel and Autoweb to result from the proposed merger;

     - a comparison of the relative financial contributions of Autobytel and
       Autoweb to the combined company following consummation of the proposed
       merger; and

     - a comparison of the financial terms of the proposed transaction with the
       financial terms of certain other recent transactions that Lehman Brothers
       deemed relevant.

     In addition, Lehman Brothers had discussions with the managements of
Autobytel and Autoweb concerning their respective businesses, operations,
assets, financial conditions and prospects and undertook such other studies,
analyses and investigations as Lehman Brothers deemed appropriate.

     In arriving at its opinion, Lehman Brothers assumed and relied upon the
accuracy and completeness of the financial and other information used by it
without assuming any responsibility for independent verification of such
information and further relied upon the assurances of managements of Autobytel
and Autoweb that they were not aware of any facts or circumstances that would
make such information inaccurate or misleading. With respect to the financial
projections of Autoweb furnished to Lehman Brothers by Autoweb and Autobytel,
respectively, upon advice of Autoweb and Autobytel, respectively, Lehman
Brothers assumed that such projections were reasonably prepared on a basis
reflecting the best currently available estimates and judgments of the
respective managements of Autoweb and Autobytel as to the future financial
performance of Autoweb and that Autoweb would perform substantially in
accordance with such projections. However, given that Autoweb's recent financial
performance had not met the projections of Autoweb's management in the past,
Lehman Brothers also prepared and considered more conservative financial
projections based upon the strong possibility that Autoweb would underperform
management's projections in the future. Lehman Brothers discussed these adjusted
projections with the management of Autobytel and they agreed with the
appropriateness of the use of such adjusted projections in performing Lehman
Brothers' analysis. With respect to the financial projections of Autobytel, upon
advice of Autobytel, Lehman Brothers assumed that such projections were
reasonably prepared on a basis reflecting the best currently available estimates
and judgments of the management of Autobytel, as to the future financial
performance of Autobytel and that Autobytel would perform substantially in
accordance with such projections. However, for purposes of its analysis, Lehman
Brothers considered certain somewhat more conservative assumptions and estimates
which resulted in certain adjustments to the projections of Autobytel. Lehman
Brothers discussed these adjusted projections with the management of Autobytel
and they agreed with the appropriateness of the use of such adjusted projections
in performing Lehman Brothers' analysis. With respect to cost savings, operating
synergies and strategic benefits expected by the managements of Autobytel and
Autoweb to result from the proposed transaction, Lehman Brothers assumed that
such cost savings, operating synergies and strategic benefits would be realized
substantially in

accordance with such expectations. In arriving at its opinion, Lehman Brothers
conducted only a limited physical inspection of the properties and facilities of
Autobytel and Autoweb and did not make or obtain any evaluations or appraisals
of the assets or liabilities of Autobytel or Autoweb. Lehman Brothers' opinion
necessarily was based upon market, economic and other conditions as they existed
on, and could be evaluated as of, the date of such opinion.

     In connection with the preparation and delivery of its opinion to
Autobytel's board of directors, Lehman Brothers performed a variety of financial
and comparative analyses, as described below. In arriving at its opinion, Lehman
Brothers did not ascribe a specific range of value to Autobytel or Autoweb, but
rather made its determination as to the fairness, from a financial point of
view, to Autobytel of the consideration to be paid by Autobytel in the proposed
merger on the basis of financial and comparative analyses. The preparation of a
fairness opinion involves various determinations as to the most appropriate and
relevant methods of financial and comparative analysis and the application of
those methods to the particular circumstances and, therefore, such an opinion is
not readily susceptible to summary description. Lehman Brothers believes that
its analyses must be considered as a whole and that considering any portion of
such analyses and factors, without considering all analyses and factors, could
create a misleading or incomplete view of the process underlying its opinion. In
its analyses, Lehman Brothers made numerous assumptions with respect to industry
performance, general business and economic conditions and other matters, many of
which are beyond the control of Autobytel and Autoweb. Any estimates contained
in these analyses are not necessarily indicative of actual values or predictive
of future results or values, which may be significantly more or less favorable
than as set forth therein. None of Autobytel, Autoweb, Lehman Brothers or any
other person assumes responsibility if future results are materially different
from those discussed. In addition, analyses relating to the value of businesses
do not purport to be appraisals or to reflect the prices at which businesses
actually may be sold.

     The following is a summary of the material financial analyses used by
Lehman Brothers in connection with providing its opinion to the Autobytel board
of directors. Certain of the summaries of financial analyses include information
presented in tabular format. In order to fully understand the financial analyses
used by Lehman Brothers, the tables must be read together with the text of each
summary. The tables alone do not constitute a complete description of the
financial analyses. Accordingly, the analyses listed in the tables and described
below must be considered as a whole. Considering any portion of such analyses
and of the factors considered, without considering all analyses and factors,
could create a misleading or incomplete view of the process underlying the
Lehman Opinion.

     In evaluating the fairness, from a financial point of view, of the
consideration to be paid by Autobytel in the proposed transaction, Lehman
Brothers evaluated Autoweb's contribution to the business, operating assets and
balance sheet of Autobytel using widely accepted methodologies, including
revenue contribution, comparable companies and comparable transaction analyses.
Lehman Brothers believed that these methodologies were particularly relevant,
given the fact that the consideration to be paid by Autobytel in the proposed
transaction represents the right of Autoweb's stockholders to receive 34% of
Autobytel's outstanding shares of common stock, as determined on the day of the
signing of the acquisition agreement and after giving effect to the shares
issued to Autoweb's stockholders. Based on all of these methodologies, the
exchange ratio range implied a pro forma ownership of Autobytel by Autoweb
stockholders of 34% to 46%. In performing these analyses, Lehman Brothers relied
on two cases of financial projections: a base case and a conservative case. The
base case (the "Base Case") was based on projections provided to Lehman Brothers
by Autobytel and Autoweb. The conservative case (the "Conservative Case") was
based on the adjusted projections prepared by Lehman Brothers after making
certain adjustments to managements' projections to reflect certain somewhat more
conservative assumptions and estimates.

     Contribution Analysis. Lehman Brothers analyzed the respective
contributions of Autobytel and Autoweb to the estimated calendar years 2001 and
2002 revenues of the combined company in the Base Case and Conservative Case as
described above. This analysis indicated the following relative contributions

of Autobytel and Autoweb and the pro forma equity ownership of holders of
Autobytel and Autoweb common stock in the combined company:

                                               2001E CONTRIBUTION                2002E CONTRIBUTION
                                         ------------------------------    ------------------------------
              KEY METRIC                 BASE CASE    CONSERVATIVE CASE    BASE CASE    CONSERVATIVE CASE
              ----------                 ---------    -----------------    ---------    -----------------

REVENUES
  Autobytel............................    58.7%            66.2%            57.1%            67.4%
  Autoweb..............................    41.3%            33.8%            42.9%            32.6%
PRO FORMA EQUITY OWNERSHIP
  Autobytel............................                             66%
  Autoweb..............................                             34%

     From the average revenue contribution for 2001 and 2002 in the Base and
Conservative Case projections, an implied equity value range of the combined
company was assumed according to Autobytel's market value as of March 26, 2001.
From this range, a corresponding range of Autoweb equity values was implied
using Autoweb's average revenue contribution range. Subsequently, Lehman
Brothers adjusted for the differences in the two companies' balance sheets,
operating items, marketing contracts and employee contracts and severance
agreements, as well as expected synergies for the combined company, to determine
a pro forma equity ownership range of 57.0% to 64.5% for Autobytel and 43.0% to
35.5% for Autoweb in the Base and Conservative Case, respectively. Lehman
Brothers noted that Autoweb's pro forma ownership of 34% was below both of the
implied ownership ranges.

     Comparable Companies Analysis. In order to assess how the public market
values shares of similar publicly traded companies, Lehman Brothers reviewed and
compared specific financial and operating data relating to Autoweb with selected
companies that Lehman Brothers deemed comparable to Autoweb, including
Amazon.com, Ashford.com, Barnesandnoble.com, Beyond.com, Buy.com, Drugstore.com,
Egghead.com, Etoys, Expedia, Peapod and Planetrx.com. Using publicly available
information, Lehman Brothers calculated and analyzed each company's enterprise
value to its historical and projected revenues. The enterprise value of each
company was obtained by adding short and long term debt, the market value of its
diluted common equity and the book value of any minority interest, and
subtracting cash and cash equivalents. As of March 26, 2001, the comparable
companies median enterprise multiple of actual calendar year 2000 and projected
2001 revenues were 0.16x and 0.10x, respectively.

     Using a range based upon the projected 2001 revenue multiple for similar
publicly traded companies between 0.00x and 0.15x, Lehman Brothers calculated
the implied range of Autoweb's equity ownership to be between 41% to 48% in the
Base Case and 41% to 46% in the Conservative Case. Lehman Brothers noted that
Autoweb's pro forma ownership of 34% was below both of the implied ownership
ranges.

     However, because of the inherent differences between the business,
operations and prospects of Autoweb and the business, operations and prospects
of the companies included in the comparable companies, Lehman Brothers believed
that it was inappropriate to, and therefore did not, rely solely on the
quantitative results of the comparable company analysis and accordingly also
made qualitative judgments concerning differences between the financial and
operating characteristics and prospects of Autoweb and the companies included in
the comparable company analysis that would affect the public trading values of
each.

     Comparable Transaction Analysis. Lehman Brothers reviewed publicly
available information with respect to various transactions involving comparable
public Internet business to consumer ("B-to-C") companies. In particular, Lehman
Brothers reviewed nine such transactions that have occurred since October 23,
1998 and determined the forward revenue multiples in these comparable
transactions. Due to the large discrepancy between market values at the time of
such transactions and the current market values of B-to-C companies, the forward
revenue valuation multiples of the selected transactions were adjusted by an
index of similar publicly traded companies used in the comparable company
analysis as of March 26, 2001. The median enterprise multiple of forward year
revenues in the comparable transactions was 0.13x. Using a range based upon the
forward 2001 revenue multiple for Autoweb of 0.05x to 0.20x,

Lehman Brothers calculated the implied range of Autoweb's equity ownership in
the combined company to be 43% to 47% in the conservative case and 43% to 50% in
the base case. Lehman Brothers noted that the comparable transaction analysis
supported its opinion, since the pro forma equity ownership of the Autoweb
shareholders in Autobytel will be 34% after consummation of the proposed
transaction.

     Lehman Brothers is an internationally recognized investment banking firm
and, as part of its investment banking activities, is regularly engaged in the
valuation of businesses and their securities in connection with mergers and
acquisitions, negotiated underwritings, competitive bids, secondary
distributions of listed and unlisted securities, private placements and
valuations for corporate and other purposes. Autobytel's board of directors
selected Lehman Brothers because of its expertise, reputation and familiarity
with Autobytel and because its investment banking professionals have experience
in transactions comparable to the merger.

     As compensation for its services in connection with the merger, Autobytel
has paid Lehman Brothers a customary fee. In addition, Autobytel has agreed to
indemnify Lehman Brothers for certain liabilities that may arise out of its
engagement by Autobytel and the rendering of the Lehman Opinion.

     In the ordinary course of its business, Lehman Brothers may actively trade
in equity securities of Autobytel and Autoweb for its own account and for the
accounts of its customers and, accordingly, may at any time hold a long or short
position in such securities.

OPINION OF AUTOWEB'S FINANCIAL ADVISOR

     Autoweb retained Credit Suisse First Boston to act as its exclusive
financial advisor in connection with the merger. In connection with Credit
Suisse First Boston's engagement, Autoweb requested that Credit Suisse First
Boston evaluate the fairness, from a financial point of view, of the exchange
ratio provided for in the merger to holders of Autoweb common stock. On March
31, 2001, the Autoweb board of directors met to review the proposed merger.
During this meeting, Credit Suisse First Boston reviewed with the board of
directors of Autoweb certain financial analyses, as described below. Also at
this meeting on March 31, 2001, Credit Suisse First Boston rendered to the
Autoweb board of directors its oral opinion, subsequently confirmed in writing,
that, as of March 31, 2001, based upon and subject to the various considerations
set forth in the Credit Suisse First Boston opinion, the exchange ratio in the
merger was fair, from a financial point of view, to holders of Autoweb common
stock.

     The full text of the Credit Suisse First Boston opinion, which sets forth,
among other things, assumptions made, procedures followed, matters considered
and limitations on the scope of the review undertaken by Credit Suisse First
Boston in rendering its opinion is attached as Annex C to this joint proxy
statement/prospectus and is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.
Autoweb stockholders are urged to, and should, read the Credit Suisse First
Boston opinion carefully in its entirety. The Credit Suisse First Boston opinion
addresses only the fairness, from a financial point of view and as of the date
of the Credit Suisse First Boston opinion, of the exchange ratio to holders of
Autoweb common stock, and does not constitute a recommendation to any
stockholder as to how such stockholder should vote or act on any matter relating
to the proposed merger. The summary of the Credit Suisse First Boston opinion in
this joint proxy statement/prospectus is qualified in its entirety by reference
to the full text of the Credit Suisse First Boston opinion.

     In connection with its opinion, Credit Suisse First Boston, among other
things,

     - reviewed a draft of the acquisition agreement dated March 29, 2001;

     - reviewed certain publicly available business and financial information
       relating to Autoweb and Autobytel;

     - reviewed certain other information relating to Autoweb and Autobytel,
       including financial forecasts, provided to it by or discussed with
       Autoweb and Autobytel, and met with the managements of Autoweb and
       Autobytel to discuss the businesses and prospects of Autoweb and
       Autobytel;

     - considered certain financial and stock market data of Autoweb and
       Autobytel and compared that data with similar data for other publicly
       held companies in businesses similar to those of Autoweb and Autobytel;

     - considered, to the extent publicly available, the financial terms of
       certain other business combinations and other transactions which have
       recently been effected or announced; and

     - considered such other information, financial studies, analyses and
       investigations and financial, economic and market criteria which Credit
       Suisse First Boston deemed relevant.

     Credit Suisse First Boston also relied upon the views of the managements of
Autoweb and Autobytel concerning the business, operational and strategic
benefits and implications of the merger, including financial forecasts provided
to Credit Suisse First Boston by Autoweb relating to synergies and operating
cost savings expected to be achieved through the combination of the operations
of Autoweb and Autobytel.

     In connection with its review, Credit Suisse First Boston did not assume
any responsibility for independent verification of any of the foregoing
information and relied on such information being complete and accurate in all
material respects. With respect to the financial forecasts for Autoweb and
Autobytel that it reviewed, Credit Suisse First Boston was advised, and assumed,
that such forecasts were reasonably prepared on bases reflecting the best
currently available estimates and judgments of the managements of Autoweb and
Autobytel as to the future financial performance of Autoweb and Autobytel,
respectively, and the best currently available estimates and judgments of the
management of Autoweb as to the cost savings and other potential synergies
(including the amount, timing and achievability thereof) anticipated to result
from the merger. In addition, Credit Suisse First Boston relied, without
independent verification, on the assessments of the management of Autoweb with
respect to (i) the future cash and other resource requirements of Autoweb and
Autobytel and (ii) the business and financial implications of Autoweb's failure
to engage in the merger or another similar transaction. Autoweb also informed
Credit Suisse First Boston, and Credit Suisse First Boston assumed, that the
merger will be treated as a tax-free reorganization for federal income tax
purposes. Credit Suisse First Boston was not requested to make, and did not
make, an independent evaluation or appraisal of the assets or liabilities
(contingent or otherwise) of Autoweb or Autobytel, nor was Credit Suisse First
Boston furnished with any such evaluations or appraisals. The Credit Suisse
First Boston opinion is necessarily based upon information available to it as of
the date of the opinion and upon financial, economic, market and other
conditions as they existed and could be evaluated on the date of the opinion.
Credit Suisse First Boston did not express any opinion as to what the value of
the Autobytel common stock actually will be when issued to the holders of
Autoweb common stock pursuant to the merger or the prices at which shares of
Autobytel common stock will trade at any time. Further, the Credit Suisse First
Boston opinion does not address the relative merits of the merger as compared to
other business combinations that might be available to Autoweb nor does it
address Autoweb's underlying business decision to effect the merger. Credit
Suisse First Boston relied as to certain legal matters on the advice of counsel
to Autoweb as provided to Autoweb. In addition, Credit Suisse First Boston
assumed that the merger will be consummated upon the terms set forth in the
draft acquisition agreement reviewed by Credit Suisse First Boston without
material alteration thereof.

     In preparing its opinion to the Autoweb board of directors, Credit Suisse
First Boston performed a variety of financial and comparative analyses. The
preparation of a fairness opinion is a complex process and is not necessarily
susceptible to partial analysis or summary description. Credit Suisse First
Boston believes that its analyses must be considered as a whole and that
selecting portions of its analyses and of the factors considered by it, without
considering all analyses and factors, could create a misleading view of the
processes underlying the Credit Suisse First Boston opinion. No company or
transaction used in the analysis performed by Credit Suisse First Boston as a
comparison is identical to Autoweb, Autobytel or the proposed merger. In
addition, Credit Suisse First Boston may have given various analyses more or
less weight than other analyses, and may have deemed various assumptions more or
less probable than other assumptions, so that the range of valuation resulting
from any particular analysis described below should not be taken to be Credit
Suisse First Boston's view of the actual value of Autoweb or Autobytel. In
performing its analyses, Credit Suisse First Boston made numerous assumptions
with respect to industry

performance, general business and economic conditions and other matters, many of
which are beyond the control of Autoweb or Autobytel. The analyses performed by
Credit Suisse First Boston are not necessarily indicative of actual values or
actual future results, which may be significantly more or less favorable than
suggested by such analyses. In addition, analyses relating to the value of
businesses or assets do not purport to be appraisals or to necessarily reflect
the prices at which businesses or assets may actually be sold. The analyses
performed were prepared solely as part of Credit Suisse First Boston's analysis
of the fairness, from a financial point of view, of the exchange ratio to
holders of Autoweb common stock and were provided to the board of directors of
Autoweb in connection with the delivery of the Credit Suisse First Boston
opinion.

     The following is a summary of the material financial analyses performed by
Credit Suisse First Boston in connection with the preparation of its opinion,
and reviewed with the Autoweb board of directors at a meeting of the Autoweb
board of directors held on March 31, 2001. Certain of the summaries of those
financial analyses include information presented in tabular format. In order to
understand fully the material financial analyses used by Credit Suisse First
Boston, the tables should be read together with the text of each summary. The
tables alone do not constitute a complete description of the material financial
analyses.

     Precedent Transaction Analysis. Credit Suisse First Boston reviewed 84
precedent transactions in the software/internet industry and calculated the
implied premiums paid in such transactions over the market price of the acquired
company prior to the announcement of such transactions. Credit Suisse First
Boston also calculated the price per Autoweb share implied by premiums at the

analysis:

(1) Based on a premium of 100%.

     No transaction utilized as a comparison in the precedent transaction
analyses is identical to the merger. In evaluating the merger, Credit Suisse
First Boston made judgments and assumptions with regard to industry performance,
general business, economic, market and financial conditions and other matters,
many of which are beyond the control of Autobytel and Autoweb, such as the
impact of competition on the businesses of Autobytel and Autoweb and the
industry generally, industry growth and the absence of any adverse material
change in the financial condition and prospects of Autobytel and Autoweb or the
Internet industry or in the financial markets in general. Mathematical analysis,
such as determining the average or the median, is not in itself a meaningful
method of using comparable transaction data.

     Synergy Analysis. Credit Suisse First Boston considered the effects of
potential synergies on the estimated pro forma results of operations of the
combined company after the merger. This analysis was based solely upon the
estimates of the management of Autoweb of the synergies that the combined

company might be able to achieve following completion of the merger. The
management of Autobytel did not provide estimates of potential synergies to
Autoweb or Credit Suisse First Boston. The actual synergies achieved by the
combined company after the merger may vary from the potential synergies
estimated by Autoweb's management and the variations may be material. Based upon
the estimates of Autoweb's management, Credit Suisse First Boston noted that the
combined company could achieve revenue synergies of approximately $2.7 million
in 2001 and approximately $7.2 million in 2002 and cost synergies of
approximately $4.2 million in 2001 and approximately $12.0 million in 2002.

     Pro Forma Combined Cash Burn Analysis. Credit Suisse First Boston analyzed
the pro forma cash resources of the combined company and its estimated cash
requirements for 2001. Credit Suisse First Boston noted that the combined
company would have had approximately $99.9 million in cash at February 28, 2001
and that the combined company would have used $11.9 million in cash during the
fourth quarter of 2000. Credit Suisse First Boston noted that, based on this
cash burn rate, the combined company had 25.3 months of cash on hand as of
February 28, 2001. This cash burn rate was based upon historical cash burn rates
and did not reflect any potential synergies that might be achieved by the
combined company after the merger.

     Contribution Analysis. Credit Suisse First Boston analyzed the relative
contributions of Autoweb and Autobytel to the pro forma total revenues, total
cash, fully-diluted equity value and fully-diluted aggregate value of the
combined company. This analysis was based upon the latest available estimates of
securities research analysts for Autoweb and Autobytel, which estimates for
Autoweb were higher than the estimates provided to Credit Suisse First Boston by
Autoweb's management. The following table summarizes the results of this
analysis:

                                                  AUTOWEB      AUTOBYTEL

     As a result of both Autoweb and Autobytel having negative aggregate values,
Credit Suisse First Boston noted that the relative contributions of Autoweb and
Autobytel to the combined company's pro forma revenues did not imply
corresponding relative pro forma equity ownership.

     Pro Forma Cash Impact Analysis. Credit Suisse First Boston analyzed certain
pro forma effects expected to result from the merger, including the expected
impact of the merger on estimated cash per share of the combined company. This
analysis indicated that Autoweb's cash per share as of February 28, 2001, when
adjusted for the settlement of existing contracts, would increase by 151.8% in
this situation.

     Pro Forma Equity Value Analysis. Credit Suisse First Boston calculated the
price per Autoweb share and premium to the Autoweb share price implied by the
pro forma equity value of the combined company calculated as the sum of the
equity values of each of Autoweb and Autobytel as of March 29, 2001. The
following table summarizes the results of this analysis:

     Pro Forma Trading Analysis. Credit Suisse First Boston calculated the price
per Autoweb share implied by the exchange ratio in the merger of 0.3553x,
assuming that Autobytel common stock traded at

various 2002 price/earnings multiples and price/earnings growth rate multiples.
The following table summarizes the results of this analysis:

     Credit Suisse First Boston also calculated the future price per Autoweb
share implied by the exchange ratio in the merger of 0.3553x, assuming that
Autobytel common stock traded at various one-year forward price/earnings
multiples and price/earnings growth rate multiples. The following table
summarizes the results of this analysis:

  synergies)......................................  $ 2.11    $ 4.22    $ 6.33    $ 8.44    $12.66

     Credit Suisse First Boston did not express any opinion as to what the value
of the Autobytel common stock actually will be when issued pursuant to the
merger or the prices at which shares of Autobytel common stock will trade at any
time.

     The actual results achieved by the combined company after the merger may
vary from such estimated results and the variations may be material.

     Credit Suisse First Boston's opinion was one of many factors taken into
consideration by the Autoweb board of directors in making its determination to
recommend the acquisition agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby.
Consequently, the analyses described above should not be viewed as determinative
of the opinion of the Autoweb board of directors or the management of Autoweb
with respect to the value of Autoweb or Autobytel or whether the Autoweb board
of directors would have been willing to agree to a different exchange ratio.

     The Autoweb board of directors retained Credit Suisse First Boston to act
as its exclusive financial advisor in connection with the merger. Credit Suisse
First Boston was selected by the Autoweb board of directors based on Credit
Suisse First Boston's qualifications, expertise and reputation. Credit Suisse
First Boston is an internationally recognized investment banking and advisory
firm. Credit Suisse First Boston, as part of its investment banking business, is
continuously engaged in the valuation of businesses and securities in connection
with mergers and acquisitions, leveraged buyouts, negotiated underwritings,
competitive biddings, secondary distributions of listed and unlisted securities,
private placements and valuations for corporate and other purposes. In the past,
Credit Suisse First Boston has provided financial and investment banking
services to Autoweb for which it received compensation. In the ordinary course
of its business, Credit Suisse First Boston and its affiliates may actively
trade the equity securities of both Autoweb and Autobytel for their own accounts
and for the accounts of customers and, accordingly, may at any time hold a long
or short position in such securities.

     Pursuant to an engagement letter dated August 23, 2000, Autoweb engaged
Credit Suisse First Boston to provide financial advisory services to the Autoweb
board of directors in connection with strategic alternatives, including the
merger, including, among other things, rendering its opinion and making the
presentation referred to above. Pursuant to the terms of the engagement letter,
Autoweb has agreed to pay Credit Suisse First Boston a customary fee in
connection therewith. Credit Suisse First Boston will also

receive a fee for rendering its opinion. In addition, Autoweb has agreed to
reimburse Credit Suisse First Boston for its out-of-pocket expenses, including
attorney's fees, incurred in connection with its engagement and to indemnify
Credit Suisse First Boston and certain related persons against certain
liabilities and expenses arising out of or in conjunction with its rendering of
services under its engagement, including liabilities arising under the federal
securities laws.

INTERESTS OF AUTOWEB DIRECTORS, OFFICERS, EMPLOYEES AND SIGNIFICANT STOCKHOLDERS
IN THE MERGER

     When considering the recommendation of Autoweb's board of directors that
stockholders approve the merger, you should be aware that some Autoweb
directors, employees and officers have interests in the merger that are
different from, or are in addition to, your interests. The Autoweb board of
directors was aware of these potential conflicts and considered them. These
include:

     - Severance Payments. Each of ten senior officers of Autoweb will receive
       severance payments equal to any unpaid base salary through the date of
       termination plus an amount equal to one year base salary plus an amount
       equal to a pro rated bonus based on the elapsed portion of the year up to
       a maximum of 35% of total annual base salary, in the event the officer is
       terminated without cause or terminates with good reason within one year
       following consummation of the merger. In addition, fifteen other senior
       employees of Autoweb will be eligible to receive severance payments equal
       to three, four or six months of the employee's base salary if they are
       terminated without cause following consummation of the merger.

     - Accelerated Vesting. Pursuant to the terms of letter agreements granting
       to ten senior officers of Autoweb change of control benefits, 75% of each
       officer's outstanding unvested options to purchase Autoweb common stock
       will vest on the consummation of the merger and the remainder will vest
       if within one year following the merger the officer is terminated without
       cause or terminates for good reason.

     - Employment. Two new directors, Jeffrey Schwartz and Mark R. Ross, will be
       appointed to the Autobytel board. In addition, some executive officers of
       Autoweb will become executive officers of Autobytel. Autobytel has agreed
       to enter into an employment agreement with Jeffrey Schwartz upon the
       consummation of the merger and may enter into additional employment
       contracts with other employees of Autoweb.

     - Indemnification. The directors and executive officers of Autoweb have
       customary rights to indemnification against certain liabilities. Further,
       Autobytel has agreed to use commercially reasonable efforts to provide
       for six years a policy of directors' and officers' liability insurance
       with respect to matters occurring on or before the effective time of the
       merger for the benefit of the directors and officers of Autoweb.

     As a result, these directors, officers, employees and stockholders could be
more likely to vote in favor of recommending the acquisition agreement and the
merger than if they did not hold these interests.

COMPLETION AND EFFECTIVENESS OF THE MERGER

     The merger will be completed when all of the conditions to completion of
the merger are satisfied or waived, including approval and adoption of the
acquisition agreement and the merger by the stockholders of Autoweb and approval
of the issuance of Autobytel common stock in the merger by stockholders of
Autobytel. We hope to complete the merger late in the second calendar quarter or
early in the third calendar quarter of 2001. The merger will become effective
upon the filing of the certificate of merger with the Secretary of State of
Delaware.

STRUCTURE OF THE MERGER AND CONVERSION OF AUTOWEB COMMON STOCK

     Pursuant to the acquisition agreement, Autobytel Acquisition I Corp., a
wholly-owned subsidiary of Autobytel, will merge with and into Autoweb.
Immediately following the merger, Autoweb will be a wholly-owned subsidiary of
Autobytel.

     Upon completion of the merger, each outstanding share of Autoweb common
stock will be converted into the right to receive 0.3553 shares of Autobytel
common stock. No fractional shares of Autobytel common stock will be issued
pursuant to the merger. In lieu thereof, each holder of shares of Autoweb common
stock who would otherwise be entitled to a fraction of a share of Autobytel
common stock shall receive an amount of cash (rounded to the nearest whole cent)
equal to the product of such fraction multiplied by the average closing price of
Autobytel common stock for the fifteen trading days immediately preceding the
last full trading day prior to the closing date of the merger, as reported on
the Nasdaq National Market. The number of shares of Autobytel common stock
awarded in the merger, after aggregating all fractional shares of Autobytel
common stock, shall be rounded down to the nearest whole share.

     Upon completion of the merger, Autobytel will assume options to purchase
shares of Autoweb common stock in connection with the merger. The number of
shares of Autobytel common stock purchasable under each post-merger option will
be equal to the number of shares of Autoweb common stock underlying the option,
multiplied by the merger exchange ratio of 0.3553 shares of Autobytel common
stock for each share of Autoweb common stock. The exercise price per share of
the Autobytel common stock issuable under each Autoweb option will equal the per
share exercise price of the Autoweb option divided by 0.3553.

EXCHANGE OF AUTOWEB STOCK CERTIFICATES FOR AUTOBYTEL STOCK CERTIFICATES

     When the merger is completed, Autobytel's exchange agent will mail to
Autoweb stockholders a letter of transmittal and instructions for use in
surrendering Autoweb stock certificates in exchange for Autobytel stock
certificates. When former Autoweb stockholders deliver their Autoweb stock
certificates to the exchange agent along with an executed letter of transmittal
and any other required documents, the Autoweb stock certificates will be
canceled and former Autoweb stockholders will receive Autobytel stock
certificates representing the number of full shares of Autobytel common stock to
which they are entitled under the acquisition agreement. They will receive
payment in cash, without interest, in lieu of any fractional shares of Autobytel
common stock which would have been otherwise issuable to them in the merger.

     Autoweb stockholders should not submit their Autoweb stock certificates for
exchange until they receive the transmittal instructions and a form of letter of
transmittal from the exchange agent.

NO DIVIDENDS

     Autoweb stockholders are not entitled to receive any dividends or other
distributions on Autobytel common stock until the merger is completed and they
have surrendered their Autoweb stock certificates in exchange for Autobytel
stock certificates.

     Subject to the effect of applicable laws, promptly following surrender of
Autoweb stock certificates and the issuance of the corresponding Autobytel
certificates, Autoweb stockholders will be paid the amount of dividends or other
distributions, without interest, with a record date after the completion of the
merger which were previously paid with respect to their whole shares of
Autobytel common stock.

     Autobytel will only issue Autoweb stockholders an Autobytel stock
certificate or a check in lieu of a fractional share in the name in which the
surrendered Autoweb stock certificate is registered. If Autoweb stockholders
wish to have their certificates issued in another name they must present the
exchange agent with all documents required to show and effect the unrecorded
transfer of ownership and show that they paid any applicable stock transfer
taxes.

MATERIAL UNITED STATES FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSIDERATIONS

     The discussion below constitutes the opinions of Paul, Hastings, Janofsky &
Walker LLP and Wilson Sonsini Goodrich & Rosati, P.C., regarding the material
federal income tax considerations generally applicable to United States holders
of Autoweb common stock who, pursuant to the merger, exchange

their Autoweb common stock solely for Autobytel common stock and cash in lieu of
fractional shares of Autobytel common stock. Consummation of the merger is
conditioned upon Autobytel's and Autoweb's receipt of opinions of their
respective counsel, confirming their opinions as described in this section
entitled "Material United States Federal Income Tax Considerations," to the
effect that the merger will qualify as a reorganization within the meaning of
Section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code.

     The opinions of Paul, Hastings, Janofsky & Walker LLP and Wilson Sonsini
Goodrich & Rosati, P.C., set forth in this section entitled "Material United
States Federal Income Tax Considerations" are subject to certain limitations,
qualifications and assumptions and are based on certain facts and
representations, including representations contained in certificates executed by
officers of Autobytel and Autoweb. The opinions have assumed the absence of
changes in relevant facts or in law between the date of this joint proxy
statement/prospectus and the closing date and assume that the merger is effected
as described in the acquisition agreement and in the joint proxy
statement/prospectus. The opinions are not binding on the Internal Revenue
Service or the courts and there can be no assurance that the Internal Revenue
Service or the courts will not take a contrary view. No ruling from the Internal
Revenue Service has been or will be sought. The discussion below is based upon
current provisions of the Internal Revenue Code, currently applicable U.S.
Treasury regulations promulgated thereunder, and judicial and administrative
decisions and rulings. Future legislative, judicial or administrative changes or
interpretations could alter or modify (including on a retroactive basis) the
discussion below.

     The discussion below does not purport to deal with all aspects of United
States federal income taxation that may affect particular stockholders in light
of their individual circumstances, and is not intended for stockholders subject
to special treatment under federal income tax law. Stockholders subject to
special treatment include, but are not limited to, insurance companies,
tax-exempt organizations, financial institutions, broker-dealers, foreign
persons, stockholders who are subject to the alternative minimum tax provisions
of the Internal Revenue Code, stockholders who hold their stock as part of a
hedge, appreciated financial position, straddle or conversion transaction,
stockholders who do not (or who will not at the time of the merger) hold their
stock as capital assets and stockholders who have acquired their stock upon the
exercise of employee options or otherwise as compensation. In addition, the
discussion below does not consider the effect of any applicable state, local or
foreign tax laws and further does not consider any tax consequences of
transactions effectuated by stockholders subsequent to, or concurrently with,
the merger. This discussion also does not describe tax consequences that are
generally assumed to be known by investors.

     In the opinion of Paul, Hastings, Janofsky & Walker LLP, counsel to
Autobytel, and in the opinion of Wilson Sonsini Goodrich & Rosati, P.C., counsel
to Autoweb, the merger will constitute a "reorganization" within the meaning of
Section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code.

     Assuming the merger constitutes a reorganization, subject to the
limitations and qualifications referred to herein, the following tax
consequences will result:

     - no gain or loss will be recognized by the holders of Autoweb common stock
       upon the receipt of Autobytel common stock solely in exchange for such
       Autoweb common stock in the merger, except as a result of cash received
       in lieu of fractional shares of Autobytel common stock;

     - cash payments received by holders of Autoweb common stock in lieu of a
       fractional share of Autobytel common stock will result in capital gain
       (or capital loss) measured by the difference between the cash payment
       received and the portion of the tax basis in the shares of Autoweb common
       stock surrendered that is allocable to such fractional share. Such
       capital gain (or capital loss) will be long-term capital gain (or capital
       loss) if the shares of Autoweb common stock allocable to such fractional
       share have been held for more than one year at the effective time of the
       merger;

     - the aggregate tax basis of the Autobytel common stock received by Autoweb
       stockholders in the merger will be the same as the aggregate tax basis of
       the Autoweb common stock surrendered in

       exchange, reduced by any tax basis allocable to a fractional share of
       Autobytel common stock for which cash is received;

     - the holding period with respect to Autobytel common stock received by
       each Autoweb stockholder in the merger will include the holding period
       for the Autoweb common stock surrendered in exchange; and

     - no gain or loss will be recognized by Autobytel, Autoweb or the
       transitory subsidiary that merges into Autoweb solely as a result of the
       merger.

THE ABOVE DISCUSSION IS INTENDED ONLY AS A SUMMARY OF THE MATERIAL UNITED STATES
FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSIDERATIONS RELATING TO THE MERGER AND DOES NOT PURPORT TO
BE A COMPLETE ANALYSIS OR DISCUSSION OF ALL POTENTIAL TAX EFFECTS RELEVANT
THERETO. AUTOWEB STOCKHOLDERS ARE URGED TO CONSULT THEIR OWN TAX ADVISORS AS TO
THE SPECIFIC TAX CONSEQUENCES TO THEM OF THE MERGER, INCLUDING TAX RETURN
REPORTING REQUIREMENTS AND THE EFFECT OF FEDERAL, STATE, LOCAL, AND FOREIGN TAX
LAWS.

ACCOUNTING TREATMENT FOR THE MERGER

     Autobytel intends to account for the merger as an acquisition under the
purchase method of accounting for business combinations.

REGULATORY FILINGS AND APPROVALS REQUIRED TO COMPLETE THE MERGER

     Although not expected by Autobytel and Autoweb, the merger may be subject
to review by the Department of Justice and the Federal Trade Commission to
determine whether it is in compliance with applicable antitrust laws. Should the
merger meet certain threshold requirements under the provisions of the
Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended, the merger may
not be consummated until the specified waiting period requirements of that Act
have been satisfied. If required, Autobytel and Autoweb intend to file all
required notification reports, together with requests for early termination for
the waiting period, with the Department of Justice and the Federal Trade
Commission under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as
amended. Certain Autoweb directors who will be directors of Autobytel after the
merger may also be required to file notification reports with the Federal Trade
Commission. In addition, the completion of this merger is subject to the
effectiveness of the registration statement of which this joint proxy
statement/prospectus is a part, and compliance with applicable corporate laws of
Delaware.

CERTAIN SECURITIES LAWS CONSIDERATIONS

     The Autobytel common stock to be issued in the merger will be registered
under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act"). These
shares will be freely transferable under the Securities Act, except for
Autobytel common stock issued to any person who is deemed to be an affiliate of
Autoweb or Autobytel. Persons who may be deemed to be affiliates include
individuals or entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common
control with Autoweb or Autobytel and include officers and directors, as well as
principal stockholders.

     Autoweb's affiliates may not sell their Autobytel common stock acquired in
the merger except pursuant to:

     - an effective registration statement under the Securities Act covering the
       resale of those shares;

     - an exemption under paragraph (d) of Rule 145 under the Securities Act; or

     - any other applicable exemption under the Securities Act.

     Autobytel's affiliates may not sell their Autobytel common stock acquired
in the merger except pursuant to:

     - Rule 144 under the Securities Act;

     - an effective registration statement under the Securities Act covering the
       resale of those shares; or

     - any other applicable exemption under the Securities Act.

DISSENTERS' RIGHTS

     No dissenters' or appraisal rights are available in connection with the
merger or any of the transactions contemplated by the acquisition agreement.
Delaware law does not provide for dissenters' or appraisal rights because
Autoweb's common stock is listed on the Nasdaq National Market and because the
shares of Autobytel common stock that Autoweb stockholders will receive in the
merger will also be listed on the Nasdaq National Market.

LISTING ON THE NASDAQ MARKET OF AUTOBYTEL COMMON STOCK TO BE ISSUED IN THE
MERGER

     Autobytel has agreed to cause the shares of Autobytel common stock to be
issued in the merger to be approved for listing on the Nasdaq National Market,
subject to official notice of issuance, prior to the effective time of the
merger.

DELISTING AND DEREGISTRATION OF AUTOWEB COMMON STOCK AFTER THE MERGER

     If the merger is completed, Autoweb's common stock will be delisted from
the Nasdaq National Market and will be deregistered under the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.

                           THE ACQUISITION AGREEMENT

     This section of the joint proxy statement/prospectus describes the
acquisition agreement. While Autobytel and Autoweb believe that the description
covers the material terms of the acquisition agreement, this summary may not
contain all of the information that is important to you. The composite conformed
acquisition agreement is attached to this joint proxy statement/prospectus as
Annex A and Autobytel and Autoweb urge you to read it carefully.

GENERAL

     Following the adoption of the acquisition agreement and approval of the
merger by Autoweb stockholders and the satisfaction or waiver of the other
conditions to the merger, Autobytel Acquisition I Corp., a wholly-owned
subsidiary of Autobytel, will merge into Autoweb. Autoweb will survive the
merger as a wholly owned subsidiary of Autobytel. If all conditions to the
merger are satisfied or waived, the merger will become effective at the time of
the filing by the surviving corporation of a duly executed certificate of merger
with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware.

THE EXCHANGE RATIO AND TREATMENT OF AUTOWEB COMMON STOCK

     At the effective time of the merger, each issued and outstanding share of
Autoweb common stock will be converted into the right to receive 0.3553 shares
of Autobytel common stock, except that any shares owned by Autoweb and any
shares owned by Autobytel or Autobytel Acquisition I Corp. will be cancelled
without conversion. Autobytel will adjust the exchange ratio to reflect any
reclassification, stock split, stock dividend, reorganization or other similar
change with respect to Autobytel common stock or Autoweb common stock occurring
before the effective time of the merger.

     Based on the exchange ratio of 0.3553 shares of Autobytel common stock for
each outstanding share of Autoweb common stock, and based on the number of
shares of Autoweb common stock outstanding as of March 31, 2001, a total of
10,490,748 shares of Autobytel common stock will be issued in the merger.

TREATMENT OF AUTOWEB STOCK OPTIONS AND WARRANTS

     At the effective time of the merger, Autobytel will assume each outstanding
option issued under Autoweb's 1997 Stock Option Plan, 1999 Equity Incentive
Plan, 1999 Employee Stock Purchase Plan, and 1999 Directors Stock Option Plan,
whether vested or unvested, to purchase shares of Autoweb common stock on
substantially the same terms and conditions as were applicable prior to the
effective time of the merger, except that (i) the options will be exercisable
for shares of Autobytel common stock, and (ii) the number of shares of Autobytel
common stock which may be purchased will be equal to the number of shares of
Autoweb common stock underlying the option multiplied by 0.3553. Any fractional
share of Autobytel common stock resulting from such adjustment will be rounded
down to the nearest whole number. The exercise price per share of Autobytel
common stock issuable under each Autoweb option will equal the per share
exercise price of the Autoweb common stock purchasable under the Autoweb option
divided by 0.3553. The exercise price will be rounded up to the nearest whole
cent.

     Autobytel will reserve for issuance a sufficient number of its common stock
for delivery upon Autoweb optionholders' exercise of options. If the shares of
Autobytel common stock underlying the assumed options have not already been
registered at the time the options are exercised, Autobytel will file a
registration statement on Form S-8 with respect to such shares within three
business days after the effective date of the merger.

     Within thirty days after the effective time, Autobytel will issue to each
person who, immediately prior to the effective time was a holder of an assumed
option, a document evidencing the foregoing assumption of such option by
Autobytel.

EXCHANGE OF CERTIFICATES

     After the effective time of the merger, Autobytel's exchange agent will
mail to each record holder of Autoweb common stock a letter of transmittal and
instructions for surrendering their certificates. Only those holders who
properly surrender their certificates in accordance with the instructions will
receive certificates representing Autobytel common stock, cash in lieu of any
fractional Autobytel common stock and any dividends or distributions to which
they are entitled. The surrendered certificates representing shares of Autoweb
common stock will be cancelled. After the effective time of the merger, each
certificate representing shares of Autoweb common stock that has not been
surrendered will only represent the right to receive common stock of Autobytel,
cash in lieu of any fractional Autobytel common stock and dividends or
distributions. Following the effective time of the merger, Autoweb will not
register any transfers of Autoweb common stock on its stock transfer books.

     Autobytel will not issue any fractional common stock in the merger.
Instead, each holder of shares of Autoweb common stock exchanged in the merger
who would otherwise be entitled to receive a fraction of a share of common stock
of Autobytel will receive cash, without interest, equal to the fractional share
multiplied by the average closing price of Autobytel common stock for the
fifteen trading days immediately preceding the last full trading day prior to
the closing date of the merger, as reported on the Nasdaq National Market.

     After the effective date of the merger, no dividends or other distributions
declared or made after the closing of the merger with respect to Autobytel
common stock will be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered Autoweb certificate
and no cash payment in lieu of fractional shares will be paid to any such holder
until the holder surrenders its Autoweb certificate in accordance with the
letter of transmittal. Upon surrender, Autobytel will pay to the record holder
of the certificate, without interest, the amount of cash payable in lieu of
fractional shares to which the holder is entitled and any dividends or
distributions with respect to the Autobytel common stock to which the holder is
entitled which have a record date after the effective date of the merger.

     If any Autoweb common stock certificate is lost, stolen or destroyed, an
Autoweb stockholder must provide an appropriate affidavit of that fact.
Autobytel may require an Autoweb stockholder to deliver a bond as indemnity
against any claim that may be made against Autobytel with respect to any lost,
stolen or destroyed certificate.

HOLDERS OF AUTOWEB COMMON STOCK SHOULD NOT SEND IN THEIR CERTIFICATES UNTIL THEY
RECEIVE A LETTER OF TRANSMITTAL FROM THE EXCHANGE AGENT.

     Autoweb further agreed to cease, as of the date of the acquisition
agreement, any and all existing activities, discussions or negotiations with any
parties conducted prior to that date with respect to any "Takeover Proposal" as
defined below.

     Until the merger is completed or the acquisition agreement is terminated,
Autoweb agreed not to, and agreed to direct its officers, directors, employees,
representatives or other agents not to, take any of the following actions:

     - solicit, initiate or encourage the making, submission or announcement of
       any Takeover Proposal;

     - participate in any discussions or negotiations regarding any Takeover
       Proposal;

     - furnish to any person any information with respect to any Takeover
       Proposal;

       or recommend any Takeover Proposal.

     Autoweb's board may, without breaching the acquisition agreement, respond
to an unsolicited, bona fide written Takeover Proposal by discussing the
proposal with, and furnishing information to the party making the proposal, if
all of the following conditions are met:

     - Autoweb's board reasonably concludes that the proposal constitutes a
       "Superior Proposal" as defined below;

       do so;

       Proposal by its board of directors, and Autoweb receives a customary
       confidentiality agreement from that party; and

       Autoweb contemporaneously furnishes the same information to Autobytel.

     A TAKEOVER PROPOSAL is any offer or proposal relating to any "Takeover
Transaction", as defined below, other than an offer, inquiry or proposal from
Autobytel.

     - the acquisition or purchase of 20% or more of the assets of Autoweb; or

     - any merger, consolidation, business combination or similar transaction
       involving Autoweb.

     A SUPERIOR PROPOSAL is a Takeover Proposal if Autoweb's board of directors
has determined after considering the written opinion of its financial advisor
that such proposal is more favorable from a financial point of view to the
stockholders of Autoweb than the merger.

     Autoweb has agreed to promptly inform Autobytel of any request for
information that Autoweb reasonably believes would lead to a Takeover
Transaction, or of any Takeover Proposal, or any inquiry with respect to or
which Autoweb reasonably believes would lead to any Takeover Proposal, the
material terms and conditions of such request, Takeover Proposal or inquiry.
Autoweb further agreed to keep Autobytel informed in all material respects of
the status and details of any such request, Takeover Proposal or

inquiry, and to provide Autobytel with advance notice of any agreement to or

the merger.

     - by mutual consent of Autobytel and Autoweb;

     - by either Autobytel or Autoweb, if any of the following shall have
       occurred:

      - if the merger is not completed before September 30, 2001 except that
        this right to terminate the acquisition agreement is not available to
        any party whose action or failure to act has been a cause of or resulted
        in the failure of the merger to occur on or before September 30, 2001 if
        such action or failure to act constitutes a breach of the acquisition
        agreement;

        authority preventing the consummation of the merger shall have become
        final and non-appealable; or

        for approval by the stockholders of Autoweb at an Autoweb stockholders
        meeting or at any adjournment of that meeting or by the stockholders of
        Autobytel at an Autobytel stockholders meeting or at any adjournment of
        that meeting, except that this right to terminate the acquisition
        agreement is not available to any party where the failure to obtain
        stockholder approval was caused by that party's action or failure to act
        and such action or failure to act constitutes a breach of the
        acquisition agreement.

     - by Autobytel if any of the following shall have occurred:

      - if for any reason Autoweb fails to call and hold the Autoweb
        stockholders meeting by September 30, 2001 unless the reason is that
        this registration statement has not been declared effective by the
        Securities and Exchange Commission at least thirty-five days before
        September 30, 2001 or unless Autoweb is terminating the acquisition
        agreement as a result of Autobytel's breach;

      - if the board of directors of Autoweb withdraws, modifies or changes its
        recommendation that the stockholders of Autoweb approve the merger in a
        manner adverse to Autobytel and its stockholders, unless such
        withdrawal, modification or change is as a result of a breach by
        Autobytel that would entitle Autoweb to terminate the acquisition
        agreement or as a result of a Material Adverse Effect on Autobytel;

      - upon a breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or obligation on
        the part of Autoweb set forth in the acquisition agreement if that
        breach is not cured within ten business days following receipt of
        written notice of the breach or in any event on or before September 30,

        the acquisition agreement, which breach has not been cured; or

      - if a Takeover Proposal shall have occurred and the board of directors of
        Autoweb in connection therewith does not within ten business days of

        reject such Takeover Proposal.

     - by Autoweb if any of the following shall have occurred:

      - if a "Change of Control," as defined below, of Autobytel shall have
        occurred;

      - upon a breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement on
        the part of Autobytel in the acquisition agreement if that breach is not
        cured within ten business days following receipt of written notice of
        the breach or in any event on or before September 30, 2001 if Autoweb
        has not willfully breached any of its covenants under the acquisition
        agreement, which breach has not been cured;

      - if for any reason Autobytel fails to call and hold the Autobytel
        stockholders meeting by September 30, 2001 unless the reason is that the
        registration statement has not been declared effective by the Securities
        and Exchange Commission at least thirty-five days before September 30,
        2001 or unless Autobytel is terminating the acquisition agreement as a
        result of Autoweb's breach;

      - if the board of directors of Autobytel withdraws, modifies or changes
        its recommendation of the issuance of Autobytel's common stock pursuant
        to the acquisition agreement in a manner adverse to Autoweb or its
        stockholders unless such withdrawal, modification or change is as a
        result of a breach by Autoweb that would entitle Autobytel to terminate
        the acquisition agreement or as a result of a Material Adverse Effect on
        Autoweb; or

      - if a Superior Proposal shall have been made and Autoweb shall have
        provided Autobytel at least five business days prior notice of the terms

        termination fee due under the acquisition agreement.

     A CHANGE OF CONTROL is any merger or other business combination involving
Autobytel or the acquisition in one or more transactions of all or substantially
all of the assets of Autobytel after which Autobytel or its successor ceases to

proposed that has not been rejected, Autoweb shall promptly pay Autobytel in
immediately available funds an amount equal to the sum of (1) $1,000,000 plus
(2) Autobytel's costs and expenses directly incurred to negotiate, execute and
perform its obligation under the acquisition agreement, including costs and
expenses related to this joint proxy statement/prospectus and this registration
statement, and the merger (but specifically excluding any costs or expenses
related to the amendment of any agreement or settlement of any dispute prior to
the execution of the acquisition agreement) up to a maximum amount of
$1,000,000:

     - if the acquisition agreement is terminated by Autobytel due to Autoweb's
       breach of any of its representations, warranties, covenants or
       obligations and such breach has not been cured within ten business days
       of receipt by Autoweb of written notice of such breach or in any event on
       or before September 30, 2001 (and Autobytel has not willfully breached
       any of its covenants under the acquisition agreement, which breach is not
       cured);

     - if the closing condition that the representations and warranties of
       Autoweb in the acquisition agreement are true and correct as of the
       effective time of the merger (except as would not have a Material Adverse
       Effect on Autoweb and except for those representations and warranties
       that address matters as of a specified date), is not satisfied, and if on
       or after September 30, 2001, Autoweb terminates the acquisition
       agreement;

     - if the closing condition that Autoweb shall have performed and complied
       in all material respects with all covenants, obligations and conditions
       in the acquisition agreement required to be performed and complied with
       as of the effective time of the merger is not satisfied, and if on or
       after September 30, 2001, Autoweb terminates the acquisition agreement;

     - if the acquisition agreement is terminated by either party because the
       required approval of the stockholders of Autoweb has not been obtained
       due to the failure to obtain the required vote of the Autoweb
       stockholders at a duly held meeting or at any adjournment of the
       stockholder meeting; or

     - if the acquisition agreement is terminated by Autobytel due to Autoweb's
       failure to call and hold the Autoweb stockholders meeting by September
       30, 2001 unless the reason is that the registration statement has not
       been declared effective by the Securities and Exchange Commission at
       least thirty-five days prior to September 30, 2001 or unless Autoweb is
       terminating the acquisition agreement as a result of Autobytel's breach.

     Autoweb also must promptly pay Autobytel in immediately available funds an
amount equal to the sum of (1) $1,000,000 plus (2) Autobytel's costs and
expenses as described and limited above:

     - if the acquisition agreement is terminated by Autobytel if a Takeover
       Proposal has occurred and the board of directors of Autoweb in connection
       with it does not within ten business days of such occurrence (or, in any
       event, on or before September 30, 2001) reject such Takeover Proposal; or

     - if the acquisition agreement is terminated by Autoweb if a Superior
       Proposal has occurred and Autoweb has provided Autobytel at least five
       business days prior notice of the terms of the Superior Proposal.

     If the acquisition agreement is terminated by Autobytel due to Autoweb's
breach of any of its representations, warranties, covenants or obligations and
such breach has not been cured within ten business days of receipt by Autoweb of
written notice of such breach or in any event on or before September 30, 2001
(and Autobytel shall not have willfully breached any of its covenants under the
acquisition agreement, which breach is not cured) then Autoweb shall promptly
reimburse Autobytel's costs and expenses as described and limited above.

TERMINATION PAYMENTS BY AUTOBYTEL

     If the acquisition agreement is terminated by Autoweb due to any of the
following, then Autobytel shall promptly pay Autoweb in immediately available
funds an amount equal to Autoweb's costs and expenses directly incurred to
negotiate, execute and perform its obligations under the acquisition agreement,
including costs and expenses related to this joint proxy statement/prospectus
and this registration statement, and the merger (but specifically excluding any
costs or expenses related to the amendment of any agreement or settlement of any
dispute prior to the execution of the acquisition agreement), up to a maximum
amount of $1,000,000:

     - if Autobytel breaches any of its representations, warranties, covenants
       or other obligations and such breach has not been cured within ten
       business days following receipt by Autobytel of written notice of such
       breach or in any event on or before September 30, 2001 (and Autoweb has
       not willfully breached any of its covenants under the acquisition
       agreement, which breach is not cured);

     - if for any reason Autobytel fails to call and hold the Autobytel
       stockholders meeting by September 30, 2001 unless the reason is that the
       registration statement has not been declared effective by the Securities
       and Exchange Commission at least thirty-five days prior to September 30,
       2001 or unless Autobytel is terminating the acquisition agreement as a
       result of Autoweb's breach;

     - if the board of directors of Autobytel withdraws, modifies or changes its
       recommendation of the issuance of Autobytel's common stock in a manner
       adverse to Autoweb or its stockholders unless such withdrawal,
       modification or change is as a result of a breach by Autoweb that would
       entitle Autobytel to terminate the acquisition agreement or as a result
       of a Material Adverse Effect on Autoweb; or

     - if a Change of Control occurs.

OPERATIONS AFTER THE MERGER

     Following the merger, it is expected that Autoweb will continue its
operations as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Autobytel. The stockholders of
Autoweb will become stockholders of Autobytel, and their rights as stockholders
will be governed by the Autobytel certificate of incorporation and bylaws, as in
effect immediately prior to the consummation of the merger, and the laws of
Delaware. See "Comparison of Stockholder Rights and Corporate Governance
Matters" on page   of this joint proxy statement/ prospectus.

     THE INITIAL DIRECTORS AND OFFICERS OF AUTOWEB AFTER THE MERGER WILL BE THE
DIRECTORS AND OFFICERS OF AUTOBYTEL ACQUISITION I CORP.

EXTENSION, WAIVER AND AMENDMENT OF THE ACQUISITION AGREEMENT

     The board of directors of Autobytel and Autoweb may amend the acquisition
agreement at any time by mutual written consent provided that an amendment made
subsequent to adoption of the acquisition agreement by the stockholders of
Autoweb, Autobytel or Autobytel Acquisition I Corp. shall not:

     - alter or change the amount or kind of consideration to be received on
       conversion of the Autoweb common stock;

     - alter or change any term of the certificate of incorporation of the
       surviving corporation to be effected by the merger; or

     - alter or change any of the terms and conditions of the acquisition
       agreement if such alteration or change would materially adversely affect
       the holders of Autoweb common stock or Autobytel Acquisition I Corp.
       common stock.

     Either Autobytel or Autoweb may extend the other's time for the performance
of any of the obligations or other acts under the acquisition agreement, waive
any inaccuracies in the other's representations and warranties and waive
compliance by the other with any of the agreements or conditions contained in
the acquisition agreement if such extension or waiver is in writing.

                        AGREEMENTS RELATED TO THE MERGER

     This section of the joint proxy statement/prospectus describes the Autoweb
Voting Agreement and the Employment Agreement with Jeffrey A. Schwartz. While
Autobytel and Autoweb believe that these descriptions cover the material terms
of these agreements, the summary may not contain all of the information that is
important to you. Copies of forms of these agreements are available upon
request. Please see the section entitled "Where You Can Find More Information"
on page   .

AUTOWEB VOTING AGREEMENT

     One member of the Autoweb board of directors and three principal
stockholders of Autoweb common stock have entered into a voting agreement with
Autoweb and Autobytel. By entering into this voting agreement these Autoweb
stockholders have agreed to vote or cause to be voted all of their shares of
Autoweb common stock in favor of the approval of the acquisition agreement and
the merger.

     They have agreed not to transfer, sell, assign or otherwise dispose of
their shares of Autoweb common stock prior to the merger, the termination of the
acquisition agreement or September 30, 2001, whichever is earlier.

     These Autoweb stockholders may vote their shares of Autoweb common stock on
all other matters.

     As of March 31, 2001, the Autoweb stockholders who entered into the voting
agreement collectively owned 8,807,973 shares of Autoweb common stock, which
represent approximately 30% of the outstanding Autoweb common stock. None of the
Autoweb stockholders who are parties to the voting agreement was paid additional
consideration in connection with the execution of the voting agreement.

EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENT WITH JEFFREY A. SCHWARTZ (SEE PAGES   )

                     DESCRIPTION OF AUTOBYTEL CAPITAL STOCK

GENERAL

     Autobytel's Fifth Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation
authorizes the issuance of up to 200,000,000 shares of common stock, par value
$0.001 per share, and 11,445,187 shares of preferred stock, par value $0.001 per
share, the rights and preferences of which may be established by the Autobytel
board of directors. As of March 31, 2001, 20,364,070 shares of common stock were
issued and outstanding and held by 142 stockholders of record and 0 shares of
preferred stock were issued and outstanding.

COMMON STOCK

     The holders of Autobytel common stock are entitled to one vote for each
share of capital stock held by such stockholder. Subject to preferences
applicable to any outstanding shares of preferred stock, the holders of common
stock are entitled to receive ratably dividends, if any, as may be declared by
the board of directors out of funds legally available for dividend payments. In
the event that Autobytel liquidates, dissolves or winds up, the holders of
common stock are entitled to share ratably in all assets remaining after payment
of liabilities and liquidation preferences of any outstanding shares of
preferred stock. Holders of common stock have no preemptive rights or rights to
convert their common stock into any other securities. There are no redemption or
sinking fund provisions applicable to the common stock. All outstanding shares
of common stock are fully paid and nonassessable.

PREFERRED STOCK

     The Autobytel board of directors is authorized to issue preferred stock
from time to time in one or more series, and to determine or alter the rights,
preferences, privileges and restrictions granted to or imposed upon any wholly
unissued series of preferred stock and to fix the number of shares of any series
of preferred stock and the designation of any such series of preferred stock.
These rights, designations and preferences include voting rights, dividend
rights, liquidation rights, redemption rights and conversion rights. No
preferred stock is issued or outstanding.

       COMPARISON OF STOCKHOLDER RIGHTS AND CORPORATE GOVERNANCE MATTERS

     The rights of Autobytel stockholders are currently governed by the Delaware
General Corporation Law (the "DGCL"), Autobytel's certificate of incorporation
and Autobytel's by-laws. The rights of Autoweb stockholders are currently
governed by the DGCL, Autoweb's certificate of incorporation and Autoweb's
by-laws. Upon completion of the merger, the rights of Autoweb stockholders who
become stockholders of Autobytel in the merger will be governed by the DGCL,
Autobytel's certificate of incorporation and Autobytel's by-laws.

     The following description summarizes the significant differences that may
affect the rights of stockholders of Autobytel and stockholders of Autoweb, but
is not a complete statement of all those differences, or a complete description
of the specific provisions referred to in this summary. The identification of
specific differences is not intended to indicate that other equally or more
significant differences do not exist. Stockholders should read carefully the
relevant provisions of the DGCL, Autobytel's certificate of incorporation,
Autobytel's by-laws, Autoweb's certificate of incorporation, and Autoweb's
by-laws.

CAPITALIZATION

     Autobytel. Autobytel's authorized capital stock is described under
"Description of Autobytel Capital Stock."

     Autoweb. The total authorized shares of capital stock of Autoweb consist of
60,000,000 shares of common stock, par value $0.001 per share, and 5,000,000
shares of preferred stock, par value $0.001 per share. At the close of business
on March 31, 2001, there were approximately 29,526,453 million shares of Autoweb
common stock outstanding and no shares of Autoweb preferred stock outstanding.

     The Autoweb board of directors is authorized to issue preferred stock from
time to time in any series, and to fix and alter the designations, preferences
and relative, participating, optional or other special rights of wholly unissued
series of preferred shares including voting rights, dividend rights, liquidation
rights, redemption rights and conversion rights.

VOTING RIGHTS

     The DGCL allows for more or less than one vote per share and permits
cumulative voting if each is provided for in the certificate of incorporation.

     Autobytel. Each holder of Autobytel common stock is entitled to one vote
for each share held of record and Autobytel's certificate of incorporation does
not permit cumulative voting for the election of directors.

     Autoweb. Each holder of Autoweb common stock is entitled to one vote for
each share held of record, and may not cumulate votes for the election of
directors.

NUMBER, ELECTION, VACANCY AND REMOVAL OF DIRECTORS

     The DGCL provides that the board of directors of a Delaware corporation
will consist of one or more directors as fixed by the corporation's certificate
of incorporation or by-laws. The DGCL also provides that a director or the
entire board of directors may be removed, with or without cause, by the holders
of a majority of the shares then entitled to vote at an election of directors.
However, in the case of a corporation whose board is classified, the directors
may be removed only for cause unless the certificate of incorporation provides
otherwise.

     Autobytel. Autobytel's certificate of incorporation provides that the
number of directors shall be set forth in the by-laws and may be changed from
time to time by an amendment to such by-laws. Autobytel's by-laws fix the number
of directors at eight. Autobytel's board of directors is divided into three
classes. After their initial terms, the directors in each class serve for a term
of three years each.

     Autobytel's by-laws provide that a decrease in the number of directors may
not shorten the term of an incumbent director. Under Autobytel's by-laws,
vacancies on the board of directors and newly created directorships resulting
from any increase in the authorized number of directors may be filled by vote of
the majority of the remaining directors, although less than a quorum, or by a
sole remaining director. Each director so chosen to fill a vacancy shall hold
office until his successor shall have been elected and shall qualify or until he
shall resign or shall have been removed. Whenever the holders of any class or
classes of stock or series thereof are entitled to elect one or more directors,
vacancies and newly created directorships of such class or classes or series may
be filled by a majority of the directors elected by such class or classes or
series thereof then in office, or by a sole remaining director so elected.

     Pursuant to the terms of the acquisition agreement, on or prior to the
closing date of the merger, Autobytel will take all actions necessary to elect
as directors two individuals designated by Autoweb.

     It is anticipated that, as allowed by Autobytel's by-laws, the Autobytel
board of directors will vote to expand its current number to 10 and then will
vote to appoint two individuals (see page   ).

     Autoweb. Autoweb's board of directors has six members. Autoweb's
certificate of incorporation provides that the number of directors may be
changed from time to time by vote of a majority of the entire board of directors
and that a decrease in the number of directors may not shorten the term of an
incumbent director. Autoweb's board of directors is divided into three classes.
After their initial terms, the directors in each class serve for a term of three
years each.

     Under Autoweb's certificate of incorporation, vacancies on the Autoweb
board of directors and newly created directorships resulting from any increase
in the authorized number of directors may be filled by the directors, acting by
majority of the directors then in office, although less than a quorum, and any
directors so chosen shall hold office until the next election of the class for
which such directors shall have been chosen and until their successors shall be
elected and qualified.

     Autoweb's certificate of incorporation provides that any director may be
removed at any time, but only for cause and only by the affirmative vote of the
holders of 75% or more of the outstanding shares of common stock of the
corporation entitled to vote generally in the election of directors cast at a
meeting of the stockholders called for that purpose, except that the foregoing
shall not apply whenever the holder of any one or more series of preferred stock
shall have the right, voting separately as a class, to elect one or more
directors of the corporation.

AMENDMENTS TO THE CERTIFICATE OF INCORPORATION

     Under the DGCL, amendments to a corporation's certificate of incorporation
require the approval of the board of directors and stockholders holding a
majority of the outstanding stock of each class entitled to vote on that
amendment as a class, unless a different proportion is specified in the
certificate of incorporation or by other provisions of the DGCL.

AMENDMENTS TO THE BY-LAWS

     Under the DGCL, by-laws of a corporation may be amended or repealed by
stockholders, and, if provided for in the corporation's certificate of
incorporation, by the directors.

     Autobytel. Autobytel's certificate of incorporation authorizes the board of
directors to amend or repeal the by-laws. Autobytel's by-laws may be amended or
repealed by the directors, by vote of a majority of the number of directors then
in office, acting at any meeting of the board, or by the stockholders, by the
vote of a majority of the outstanding shares of voting stock of the corporation,
at an annual meeting of the stockholders, without previous notice, or at any
special meeting of stockholders, provided that notice of such amendment or
repeal is given in the notice of the special meeting.

     Autoweb. Autoweb's by-laws provide that its stockholders holding a majority
of the corporation's outstanding voting stock have the power to adopt, amend, or
repeal its by-laws. Autoweb's certificate of

incorporation gives Autoweb's board of directors the power to adopt, amend or
repeal Autoweb's by-laws except insofar as the by-laws adopted by the
stockholders provide otherwise.

STOCKHOLDER ACTION

     The DGCL authorizes stockholder action without a meeting unless otherwise
provided in a corporation's certificate of incorporation.

     For both Autobytel and Autoweb the certificate of incorporation provides
that the stockholders may not take action by written consent without a meeting,
but must take action at a duly called annual or special meeting of stockholders.

SPECIAL STOCKHOLDER MEETINGS

     Under the DGCL, a special meeting of stockholders may be called by the
board of directors or by any other person authorized to do so in the certificate
of incorporation or the by-laws. The DGCL requires notice of stockholders'
meetings to be sent to all stockholders of record entitled to vote thereon not
less than ten nor more than sixty days before the date of the meeting.

     Autobytel. Autobytel's by-laws provide that special meetings of
stockholders may be called at any time by the board of directors, by a committee
of the board of directors whose powers and authority include the power to call
such meetings, by the Chairman of the Board, or by the President.

     Autoweb. Autoweb's by-laws provide special meetings of stockholders may be
called at any time by the Chairman of the Board, the Chief Executive Officer,
the President, or by a majority of the members of the board of directors.

     The by-laws of each company provide that notice of each meeting of the
stockholders, whether annual or special, shall be given not fewer than ten nor
more than sixty days in advance of the date of that meeting.

LIMITATION OF PERSONAL LIABILITY OF DIRECTORS AND INDEMNIFICATION

     The DGCL provides that a corporation's certificate of incorporation may
include a provision limiting the personal liability of a director to the
corporation or its stockholders for monetary damages for breach of fiduciary
duty as a director. The DGCL permits a corporation to indemnify any director,
officer, employee or agent of the corporation for expenses, monetary damages,
fines and settlement amounts to the extent the person acted in good faith and in
a manner he or she believed to be in the best interests of the corporation and,
with respect to any criminal action, had no reasonable cause to believe the
conduct was unlawful.

     The DGCL does not permit indemnification if the person is held liable to
the corporation except to the extent that an appropriate court concludes, upon
application by the person, that despite the adjudication of liability but in
view of all the circumstances, the person is fairly and reasonably entitled to
indemnification for those expenses that the court deems proper. No provision can
eliminate or limit the liability of a director for:

     - any breach of the director's duty of loyalty to the corporation or its
       stockholders;

     - acts or omissions not in good faith or which involve intentional
       misconduct or a knowing violation of the law;

     - violation of Section 174 of the DGCL regarding unlawful payment of
       dividends or unlawful stock purchases or redemptions;

     - any transaction from which the director derived an improper personal
       benefit; or

     - any act or omission before the adoption of a provision eliminating or
       limiting the liability of a director for breach of fiduciary duty in the
       certificate of incorporation.

     Autobytel's and Autoweb's certificate of incorporation and by-laws limit or
eliminate the liability of directors to the fullest extent permitted by the DGCL
and require indemnification to the maximum extent permitted by the DGCL.

DIVIDENDS

     As Delaware corporations, Autobytel and Autoweb may declare and pay
dividends out of their surplus or, if they have no surplus, out of any net
profits for the fiscal year in which the dividend was declared or for the
preceding fiscal year in which the dividend was declared, provided that the
payment will not reduce capital below the amount of capital represented by all
classes of shares having a preference upon the distribution of assets.

PROVISIONS RELATING TO ACQUISITIONS AND BUSINESS COMBINATIONS

     Section 203 of the DGCL prohibits a Delaware corporation from engaging in
any "business combination" with any person who owns 15% or more of a
corporation's voting stock, such as an interested stockholder, for a period of
three years following the time that person became an interested stockholder,
unless:

     - the corporation's board of directors has approved, before the time on
       which that person became an interested stockholder, either the business
       combination or the transaction that resulted in the person becoming an
       interested stockholder;

     - upon consummation of the transaction that resulted in that person
       becoming an interested stockholder, that person owned at least 85% of the
       corporation's voting stock outstanding at that time, excluding shares
       owned by persons who are both directors and officers and shares owned by
       employee stock plans in which participants do not have the right to
       determine confidentially whether shares will be tendered in a tender or
       exchange offer; or

     - at or after the time on which that person became an interested
       stockholder, the business combination is approved by the board of
       directors and authorized by the affirmative vote, at an annual or special
       meeting and not by written consent, of at least 66 2/3% of the
       outstanding voting stock not owned by the interested stockholder.

     For purposes of determining whether a person is the "owner" of 15% or more
of a corporation's voting stock for purposes of Section 203 of the DGCL,
ownership is defined broadly to include the right, directly or indirectly, to
acquire the stock or to control the voting or disposition of the stock.

     A "business combination" is also defined broadly to include:

     - mergers and sales or other dispositions of 10% or more of the assets of a
       corporation with or to an interested stockholder;

     - specific transactions resulting in the issuance or transfer to the
       interested stockholder of any stock of the corporation or its
       subsidiaries;

     - specific transactions that would result in an increase in the
       proportionate share of a corporation's or its subsidiaries' stock owned
       by the interested stockholder; and

     - any receipt by the interested stockholder of the benefit, directly or
       indirectly, except proportionately as a stockholder, of any loans,
       advances, guarantees, pledges or other financial benefits provided by or
       through the corporation or any of its subsidiaries.

     A Delaware corporation may elect not to be governed by Section 203 by a
provision contained in its original certificate of incorporation, its by-laws,
or an amendment to the original certificate of incorporation, which amendment
must be approved by a majority of the shares entitled to vote and may not be
further amended by the board of directors. This type of amendment is effective
immediately in the case of a corporation that has not elected in its original
certificate of incorporation or amendment thereto to be governed by Section 203
and has never had voting stock listed on a national securities exchange,

authorized for quotation on the Nasdaq Stock Market or held of record by more
than 2,000 stockholders. Otherwise this amendment is not effective until 12
months following its adoption.

     Neither Autobytel nor Autoweb has made an election not to be governed by
Section 203 and both are therefore subject to Section 203 of the DGCL.

MERGERS, ACQUISITIONS AND OTHER TRANSACTIONS

     Under the DGCL, a merger, consolidation or sale of all or substantially all
of a corporation's assets must be approved by the board of directors and by a
majority of the outstanding stock of the corporation entitled to vote on the
matter, except that no vote of stockholders of a constituent corporation
surviving a merger is required unless the corporation provides otherwise in its
certificate of incorporation if:

     - the acquisition agreement does not amend the certificate of incorporation
       of the surviving corporation;

     - each share of stock of the surviving corporation outstanding before the
       merger is an identical outstanding or treasury share after the merger;
       and

     - either no shares of common stock of the surviving corporation are to be
       issued or delivered by way of the merger or, if common stock will be
       issued or delivered, it will not increase the number of shares of common
       stock outstanding immediately before the merger by more than 20%.

     Autobytel. Autobytel is not required by the DGCL to submit the proposed
merger to its stockholders for approval; however, approval is being sought from
Autobytel's stockholders to satisfy the listing requirements of the Nasdaq
because more than 20% of Autobytel's stock is being issued in the merger.

     Autoweb. Autoweb is required by the DGCL to submit the proposed merger to
its stockholders for approval.

DISSENTERS' APPRAISAL RIGHTS

     Under the DGCL, dissenters' rights of appraisal are available to a
stockholder of a corporation only in connection with some mergers or
consolidations involving that corporation. Appraisal rights are not available
under the DGCL if the corporation's stock is either:

     - listed on a national securities exchange or designated as a national
       market system security on an interdealer quotation system by the National
       Association of Securities Dealers, Inc., as the Autobytel and Autoweb
       common shares are, or

     - held of record by more than 2,000 stockholders;

except that appraisal rights will be available if the merger or consolidation
requires stockholders to exchange their stock for anything other than:

     - shares of the surviving corporation,

     - shares of another corporation that will be listed on a national
       securities exchange, designated as a national market system security on
       an interdealer quotation system by the National Association of Securities
       Dealers, Inc. or held of record by more than 2,000 stockholders, or

     - cash in place of fractional shares.

     Additionally, no appraisal rights are available if the corporation is the
surviving corporation, and no vote of its stockholders is required for the
merger.

     Appraisal rights are not available to Autobytel or Autoweb stockholders in
connection with the proposed merger.

PREEMPTIVE RIGHTS

     Under the DGCL, stockholders do not have a statutory preemptive right to
acquire proportional amounts of a corporation's unissued shares upon a decision
by the board of directors to issue them.

     Neither Autobytel's nor Autoweb's certificate of incorporation provides for
its stockholders to have any preemptive rights with respect to any shares of its
capital stock.

                          THE AUTOBYTEL ANNUAL MEETING

DATE, TIME AND PLACE OF AUTOBYTEL ANNUAL MEETING

     The date, time and place of the annual meeting of Autobytel stockholders
are as follows:

                                            , 2001
                                  a.m. Pacific time

PURPOSE OF THE ANNUAL MEETING

     Autobytel is furnishing this joint proxy statement/prospectus to its
stockholders in connection with the solicitation of proxies by Autobytel's board
of directors. This joint proxy statement/prospectus is being mailed on or about
               , 2001. The Autobytel board of directors will use the proxies at
the annual meeting of stockholders of Autobytel to be held on                ,
2001 and at any adjournment or postponement thereof.

     The annual meeting is being held so that Autobytel stockholders may
consider and vote upon the following proposals:

     (5) To transact any other business that properly comes before the annual

RECORD DATE AND OUTSTANDING SHARES

     Autobytel's board of directors has fixed the close of business on
               , 2001 as the record date for the annual meeting. Only holders of
record of Autobytel's common stock at the close of business on the record date
are entitled to notice of and to vote at the meeting. As of the close of
business on the record date, there were        shares of common stock
outstanding and entitled to vote, held of record by approximately
       stockholders, although Autobytel has been informed that there are in
excess of        beneficial owners of common stock.

QUORUM AND VOTE REQUIRED

     Holders of Autobytel common stock are entitled to one vote for each share
held as of the record date. Approval of Proposals 1 and 3 requires the
affirmative vote of a majority of the outstanding common stock of Autobytel
present in person or represented by proxy at the meeting. Approval of the
directors in Proposal 2 requires the vote of a plurality of the outstanding
common stock of Autobytel present in person or represented by proxy at the
meeting. Approval of Proposal 4 requires the affirmative vote of a majority of
the outstanding common stock of Autobytel. Attendance at the meeting in person
or by proxy of the shares representing a majority of the outstanding common
stock of Autobytel is required for a quorum.

     On the record date, directors and executive officers of Autobytel as a
group beneficially owned approximately        million shares of common stock.

ABSTENTIONS

     Any abstention will be counted for purposes of determining a quorum, but
will have the same effect as a vote AGAINST the proposals considered at the
annual meeting.

BROKER NON-VOTES

     In the event that a broker, bank, custodian, nominee or other record holder
of Autobytel's common stock indicates on a proxy that it does not have
discretionary authority to vote certain shares on a particular matter, which is
called a broker non-vote, those shares will not be considered for purposes of
determining the number of shares entitled to vote with respect to a particular
proposal on which the broker has expressly not voted, but will be counted for
purposes of determining the presence or absence of a quorum for the transaction
of business. Failing to instruct a broker on Proposal 4 has the same effect as
voting against Proposal 4.

DISSENTERS' RIGHTS

     Under Delaware law, Autobytel stockholders are not entitled to dissent from
the merger.

SOLICITATION OF PROXY; EXPENSES OF PROXY SOLICITATION

     The enclosed proxy is solicited by and on behalf of the board of directors
of Autobytel. In addition to solicitation by mail, officers, directors and
regular employees of Autobytel, who will receive no additional compensation for
their services, may solicit proxies by mail, telegraph, facsimile transmission
or personal calls. These persons will receive no additional compensation for
solicitation of proxies, but may be reimbursed for reasonable out-of-pocket
expenses.

     Autobytel will pay all of the expenses of soliciting proxies to be voted at
the meeting, except that Autoweb will share equally the expenses incurred in
connection with filing and printing this joint proxy statement/prospectus.
Autobytel has requested brokers and nominees who hold stock in their name to
furnish this proxy material to their customers and Autobytel will reimburse such
brokers and nominees for their related out-of-pocket expenses.

     Autobytel has also engaged [               ] to solicit proxies on its
behalf. It is expected that [               ]'s fees will be approximately
$[               ] plus the reimbursement of expenses.

VOTING OF PROXIES

     The proxy accompanying this joint proxy statement/prospectus is solicited
on behalf of the Autobytel board of directors for use at the meeting. Please

enclosed envelope or otherwise mail it to Autobytel. All properly signed proxies
that Autobytel receives prior to the vote at the meeting and that are not
revoked will be voted at the meeting according to the instructions indicated on
the proxies or, if no direction is indicated, such proxies will be voted FOR
each of the aforementioned proposals to be considered at the annual meeting.

     Autobytel's board of directors does not know of any matter that is not
referred to in this joint proxy statement/prospectus to be presented for action
at the meeting. If any other matters are properly brought before the meeting,
the persons named in the proxies will have discretion to vote on such matters in
accordance with their best judgment.

REVOCABILITY OF PROXY

     If you are the holder of record for your shares, you may revoke your proxy
at any time before it is exercised at the annual meeting by taking any of the
following actions:

       92612-1400;

     - delivering a signed subsequent proxy relating to the same shares and
       bearing a later date prior to the vote at the meeting; or

     - attending the annual meeting and voting in person, although attendance at
       the meeting will not, by itself, revoke a proxy.

     Please note, however, that if your shares are held of record by a broker,
bank or other nominee and you wish to vote at the meeting, you must bring to the
meeting a letter from the broker, bank or other nominee confirming your
beneficial ownership of the shares.

directors, if any nominee withdraws or otherwise becomes unavailable to serve,

                          RATIFICATION AND APPROVAL OF
                   AUTOBYTEL'S INDEPENDENT PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS

     The board of directors has selected Andersen LLP to audit the financial
statements of Autobytel for the year ended December 31, 2001. Andersen LLP has
audited Autobytel's financial statements since 1995.

     THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS RECOMMENDS THAT THE STOCKHOLDERS VOTE FOR THE
PROPOSAL TO RATIFY AND APPROVE THE SELECTION OF ANDERSEN LLP AS AUTOBYTEL'S
INDEPENDENT PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS FOR FISCAL 2001.

     It is expected that a representative of Andersen LLP will be present at the
annual meeting to respond to any questions and to make a statement on behalf of
his or her firm, if such representative so desires.

                                 FEE DISCLOSURE

AUDIT FEES

     The aggregate fees billed by Andersen LLP for professional services
rendered for the audit of Autobytel's annual financial statements for the year
ended December 31, 2000 and for the reviews of the financial statements included
in Autobytel's Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for that year were $147,000.

FINANCIAL INFORMATION SYSTEMS DESIGN AND IMPLEMENTATION FEES

     No fees were billed by Andersen LLP for professional services rendered for
financial information systems design and implementation for the year ended
December 31, 2000.

ALL OTHER FEES

     The aggregate fees billed by Andersen LLP for services rendered to
Autobytel, other than for services described above, for the year ended December
31, 2000 were approximately $220,000. These other services consisted of audit
and tax related services, such as review of the Securities and Exchange
Commission filings, tax compliance and consultations on accounting and tax
matters.

     The audit committee has determined that the provision of services rendered

                              AUTOBYTEL PROPOSAL 4

                      APPROVAL OF AMENDMENT TO CERTIFICATE
                         OF INCORPORATION CHANGING NAME

     The board of directors of Autobytel has unanimously approved and directed
that there be submitted to stockholders for their approval an amendment to
Article I of Autobytel's Fifth Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation
to change the name of Autobytel to "Autobytel Inc." To effect such a change,
Article I of Autobytel's Fifth Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation
will be amended to read in its entirety as follows:

                                   "ARTICLE I

      The name of the corporation is Autobytel Inc. (the "Corporation")."

     This amendment to change the name of Autobytel, if approved by the
stockholders, will become effective on the date the amendment is filed with the
Secretary of State of Delaware. Autobytel anticipates that the filing to effect
the name change will be made as soon as practicable after the annual meeting.

     The board of directors has determined that a change in the Autobytel name
is advisable because Autobytel owns more than one automotive Web site. The name
change will not affect the validity of currently outstanding stock certificates.
Autobytel's current stockholders will not be required to surrender or exchange
any stock certificates that they now hold and should not send such certificates
to Autobytel or its transfer agent.

     THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS OF AUTOBYTEL RECOMMENDS THAT THE STOCKHOLDERS VOTE
FOR THE PROPOSAL TO APPROVE THE AMENDMENT TO AUTOBYTEL'S FIFTH AMENDED AND
RESTATED CERTIFICATE OF INCORPORATION TO CHANGE THE NAME OF AUTOBYTEL AS
DESCRIBED ABOVE.

     (3) To ratify the selection of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP as Autoweb's
         independent auditors for 2001.

     (4) To transact such other business as may properly come before the annual
         meeting.

RECORD DATE AND OUTSTANDING SHARES

     The board of directors of Autoweb has fixed the close of business on
            , 2001 as the record date for the annual meeting. Only holders of
record of Autoweb common stock at the close of business on the record date are
entitled to notice of and to vote at the meeting. As of the close of business on
the record date, there were                shares of Autoweb common stock
outstanding and entitled to vote, held of record by approximately
               stockholders, although Autoweb has been informed that there are
approximately                beneficial owners.

VOTE AND QUORUM REQUIRED

     Holders of Autoweb common stock are entitled to one vote for each share
held as of the record date. Attendance at the meeting in person or by proxy of a
majority of the outstanding shares of Autoweb common stock is required for a
quorum. Approval of the merger and acquisition agreement requires the
affirmative vote of a majority of the shares of Autoweb common stock outstanding
on the record date. Election of the directors requires a plurality of the votes
of the shares present in person or represented by proxy at the meeting and
entitled to vote on the election of directors. Approval of any other matter
shall be decided by the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the
shares of stock entitled to vote

thereon, that are present in person or represented by proxy at the meeting and
are voted for or against the matter.

     On the record date, the directors and executive officers of Autoweb as a
group beneficially owned                shares of Autoweb common stock
(excluding any shares issuable upon the exercise of options). Certain
stockholders, directors and executive officers of Autoweb have entered into
stockholder voting agreements with Autobytel that obligate them to vote, with
respect to a total of approximately      % of Autoweb common shares outstanding
as of the record date, in favor of approval of the merger and acquisition
agreement.

SOLICITATION OF PROXY

     The proxy is solicited by and on behalf of the board of directors of
Autoweb. Autoweb will also be using the proxy solicitation firm of Regan &
Associates. In addition to solicitation by mail, directors, officers and key
employees of Autoweb may solicit proxies in person or by telephone, telegram or
other means of communication. These persons will receive no additional
compensation for solicitation of proxies, but may be reimbursed for reasonable
out-of-pocket expenses.

VOTING OF PROXIES; ABSTENTIONS AND BROKER NON-VOTES

     All properly executed proxies received before the vote at the annual
meeting and not revoked, will be voted in accordance with the instructions
indicated on the proxies. If no instructions are indicated, such proxies will be
voted FOR each of the aforementioned proposals, and the proxy holder may vote
the proxy in its discretion as to any other matter which may properly come
before the meeting.

     In the event that a broker, bank, custodian, nominee or other record holder
of Autoweb common stock indicates on a proxy that it does not have discretionary
authority to vote certain shares on a particular matter, which is called a
broker non-vote, those shares will be counted for purposes of determining the
presence or absence of a quorum for the transaction of business but will count
as a vote against the proposal to approve the merger.

DISSENTERS' RIGHTS

     Under Delaware law, Autoweb stockholders are not entitled to dissent from
the merger.

EXPENSES OF PROXY SOLICITATION

     The fee for the proxy solicitation services of Regan & Associates is
$6,500.00, which includes all expenses incurred in connection with these
services. Autoweb will pay the expenses of soliciting proxies to be voted at the
meeting, except that Autobytel will share equally the expenses incurred in
connection with filing and printing this joint proxy statement/prospectus.
Following the original mailing of the proxies and other soliciting materials,
Autoweb will request brokers, custodians, nominees and other record holders of
Autoweb common stock to forward copies of the proxy and other soliciting
materials to persons for whom they hold shares of Autoweb common stock and to
request authority for the exercise of proxies. In such cases, upon the request
of the record holders, Autoweb will reimburse such holders for their reasonable
expenses.

PROXIES

     The proxy accompanying this joint proxy statement/prospectus is solicited
on behalf of the Autoweb board of directors for use at the meeting. Please
complete, date and sign the accompanying proxy and promptly return it in the
enclosed envelope or otherwise mail it to the corporate offices of Autoweb to
the attention of the corporate secretary.

     The board of directors of Autoweb does not know of any matter that is not
referred to in this joint proxy statement/prospectus to be presented for action
at the meeting. If any other matters are properly

brought before the meeting, the persons named in the proxies will have
discretion to vote on such matters in accordance with their best judgment.

REVOCABILITY OF PROXY

     Any person signing a proxy given pursuant to this solicitation has the
power to revoke it before the annual meeting or at the annual meeting before the
vote pursuant to the proxy. A proxy may be revoked by a writing delivered to
Autoweb stating that the proxy is revoked, by a subsequent proxy that is signed
by the person who signed the earlier proxy and is presented at the annual
meeting, or by attendance at the annual meeting and voting in person.

     Please note, however, that if your shares are held of record by a broker,
bank or other nominee and you wish to vote at the meeting, you must bring to the
meeting a letter from the broker, bank or other nominee confirming your
beneficial ownership of the shares.

RECOMMENDATION OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS

     The board of directors of Autoweb has unanimously determined that the terms
of the acquisition agreement and the merger are fair, advisable and in the best
interests of Autoweb and the Autoweb stockholders. Accordingly, the Autoweb
board of directors recommends that Autoweb stockholders vote FOR the proposal to
approve the merger and the acquisition agreement, FOR the proposal to elect two
Class II directors and FOR the proposal to ratify the selection of
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP as Autoweb's independent auditors for 2001.

TO ASSURE THAT YOUR SHARES ARE REPRESENTED AT THE MEETING, PLEASE COMPLETE, DATE
AND SIGN THE ENCLOSED PROXY AND MAIL IT PROMPTLY IN THE POSTAGE-PAID ENVELOPE
PROVIDED, WHETHER OR NOT YOU PLAN TO ATTEND THE MEETING. YOU MAY REVOKE YOUR
PROXY AT ANY TIME BEFORE IT IS VOTED.

                      RATIFICATION AND APPROVAL OF MERGER
                           AND ACQUISITION AGREEMENT

     The merger will be consummated on the terms and subject to the conditions
set forth in the acquisition agreement. As a result of the merger, a wholly
owned subsidiary of Autobytel will be merged with and into Autoweb, with Autoweb
as the surviving corporation. Autobytel will issue 0.3553 shares of common stock
in exchange for each share of outstanding common stock of Autoweb.

     You are encouraged to read the sections of this joint proxy
statement/prospectus entitled "Merger" on page   and "Acquisition Agreement" on
page   .

     THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS OF AUTOWEB BELIEVES THAT THE TERMS OF THE MERGER ARE
FAIR, ADVISABLE AND IN THE BEST INTERESTS OF AUTOWEB AND ITS STOCKHOLDERS AND
RECOMMENDS THAT AUTOWEB STOCKHOLDERS VOTE FOR THE PROPOSAL TO RATIFY, APPROVE
AND ADOPT THE MERGER AND THE ACQUISITION AGREEMENT.

     In considering the recommendation of the Autoweb board of directors with
respect to the merger, you should be aware that certain directors and officers
of Autoweb have certain interests in the merger that are different from, or are
in addition to, the interests of Autoweb's stockholders generally. Please see
the section of this joint proxy statement/prospectus entitled "Interests of
Autoweb Directors, Officers, Employees and Significant Stockholders in the
Merger" on page   .

                               AUTOWEB PROPOSAL 2

             NOMINATION AND ELECTION OF AUTOWEB CLASS II DIRECTORS

     The board of directors of Autoweb presently consists of six members and is
divided into three equal classes, with one vacancy. Each class serves three
years, with the terms of office of the respective classes expiring in successive
years. Directors in Class II will stand for election at the annual meeting and
if elected, will serve on Autoweb's board of directors in the event the merger
is not consummated. The terms of office of directors in Class I and Class III do
not expire until the annual meetings of stockholders held in 2003 and 2002,
respectively. The board of directors proposes that each of the Class II nominees
named below, both of whom are currently serving as Class II directors, be
re-elected as a Class II director for a three-year term expiring at the annual
meeting of stockholders in 2004 and until such director's successor is duly
elected and qualified or until such director's earlier resignation or removal.
THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS RECOMMENDS THAT THE STOCKHOLDERS VOTE FOR THE ELECTION OF
THE NOMINEES NAMED BELOW UNDER "NOMINEES TO THE BOARD." Shares represented by
the accompanying proxy will be voted for the election of each of the two
nominees named below unless the proxy is marked in such a manner as to withhold
authority so to vote. If any nominee for any reason is unable to serve or for
good cause will not serve, the proxies may be voted for such substitute nominee
as the proxy holder may determine. Autoweb is not aware of any nominee who will
be unable to or for good cause will not serve as a director.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS' MEETINGS AND COMMITTEES

     During 2000, the board of directors met 11 times, including telephone
conference meetings and acted by written consent 6 times. No director attended
fewer than 75% of the aggregate of the total number of meetings of the board of
directors (held during the period for which he was a director) and the total
number of meetings held by all committees of the board of directors on which
such director served (during the period that such director served).

     Standing committees of the board of directors include an audit committee
and a compensation committee.

     The current members of the audit committee are Messrs. Hoag, Lepard and
Ross. The audit committee met 3 times during 2000. The audit committee meets
with Autoweb's independent auditors to review the adequacy of Autoweb's internal
control systems and financial reporting procedures; reviews the general scope of
Autoweb's annual audit and the fees charged by the independent auditors; reviews
and monitors the performance of non-audit services by Autoweb's auditors;
reviews the fairness of any proposed transaction between any officer, director
or other affiliate of Autoweb, and after such review, makes recommendations to
the full board of directors; and performs such further functions as may be
required by any stock exchange or over-the-counter market upon which Autoweb's
common stock may be listed.

     The current members of the compensation committee are Messrs. Hoag, Lepard
and Ross. The compensation committee met 3 times and has not acted by written
consent during 2000. The compensation committee recommends compensation for
officers and employees of Autoweb, grants options and stock awards under

COMPENSATION COMMITTEE INTERLOCKS AND INSIDER PARTICIPATION

     None of the members of the compensation committee of the board of directors
has at any time since Autoweb's formation been an officer or employee of
Autoweb. No executive officer of Autoweb serves as a member of the board of
directors or compensation committee of any entity that has one or more executive
officers serving on Autoweb's board of directors or compensation committee.

DIRECTOR COMPENSATION

     Autoweb's directors do not receive cash compensation for their services as
directors but are reimbursed for their reasonable and necessary expenses for
attending board of directors and board committee meetings. Members of the board
of directors who are not employees of Autoweb, or any parent, subsidiary or
affiliate of Autoweb, are eligible to participate in Autoweb's 1999 Directors
Stock Option Plan unless they are representatives of venture capital funds or
corporate investors.

     In January 1999, Autoweb's board of directors adopted, and in March 1999
its stockholders approved, the 1999 Directors Stock Option Plan. Autoweb has
reserved a total of 150,000 shares of common stock for issuance under the
directors' plan. Members of the board of directors who are not employees of
Autoweb, or any parent, subsidiary or affiliate of Autoweb, will be eligible to
participate in the directors plan unless they are representatives of venture
capital funds or corporate investors. The option grants under the directors plan
are automatic and nondiscretionary, and the exercise price of the options must
be 100% of the fair market value of the common stock on the date of grant. Each
eligible director who becomes a

member of the board of directors will initially be granted an option to purchase
15,000 shares (an "Initial Grant") on the date the director first becomes a
director. Immediately following each annual meeting of Autoweb's stockholders,
each eligible director will automatically be granted an additional option to
purchase 7,500 shares if the director has served continuously as a member of the
board since the date of the director's Initial Grant. The term of these options
is ten years, provided that they will terminate seven months following the date
the director ceases to be a director or a consultant of Autoweb or twelve months
if the termination is due to death or disability. All options granted under the
directors plan will vest over four years at a rate of 2.08% per month, provided
the optionee continues as a member of the board of directors or as a consultant
to Autoweb. In the event of Autoweb's dissolution or liquidation or a "change in
control" transaction, options granted under the directors plan will become 100%
vested and exercisable in full.

                               AUTOWEB PROPOSAL 3

          RATIFICATION OF SELECTION OF AUTOWEB'S INDEPENDENT AUDITORS

     Autoweb has selected PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP as its independent auditors
to perform the audit of Autoweb's financial statements for the year ending
December 31, 2001, and the stockholders are being asked to ratify such
selection.

     PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP has been Autoweb's independent auditor since
October 3, 1995. Representatives of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP will be present
at the annual meeting, with the opportunity to make a statement if they desire
to do so, and will be available to respond to appropriate questions.

     THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS RECOMMENDS A VOTE FOR THE RATIFICATION OF THE
SELECTION OF PRICEWATERHOUSECOOPERS LLP.

                                 FEE DISCLOSURE

AUDIT FEES

     The aggregate fees billed by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP for professional
services rendered for the audit of Autoweb's annual financial statements for the
year ended December 31, 2000 and for the reviews of the financial statements
included in Autoweb's Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for that year were
$215,000, of which an aggregate amount of $110,000 has been billed through
December 31, 2000.

FINANCIAL INFORMATION SYSTEMS DESIGN AND IMPLEMENTATION FEES

     No fees were billed by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP for professional services
rendered for financial information systems design and implementation for the
year ended December 31, 2000.

ALL OTHER FEES

     The aggregate fees billed by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP for services
rendered to Autoweb, other than for services described above, for the year ended
December 31, 2000 were approximately $17,600. These other services consisted of
audit and tax related services, such as review of the Securities and Exchange
Commission filings, tax compliance and consultations on accounting and tax
matters.

     The audit committee has determined that the provision of services rendered
above for financial information systems design and implementation fees, and all
other fees is compatible with maintaining PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP's
independence.

                               AUTOBYTEL BUSINESS

OVERVIEW

     Autobytel is an internationally branded online automotive commerce company
that provides consumers with automotive solutions throughout the lifecycle of
vehicle ownership, capturing revenue at multiple stages. Autobytel owns leading,
branded Internet sites for new and pre-owned vehicle information and automotive
services that link buyers and sellers in an information-rich environment.
Through Autobytel's Web sites, www.autobytel.com and www.carsmart.com, consumers
can research pricing, specifications and other information regarding new and
pre-owned vehicles and purchase, finance, lease, insure, sell or maintain their
vehicles. Autobytel believes that its services provide benefits for consumers by
supplying them with information to make informed and intelligent vehicle
decisions throughout the lifecycle of vehicle ownership.

     Consumers can purchase new vehicles through Autobytel's dealer referral
network. When consumers indicate they are ready to buy a vehicle, they can be
connected to Autobytel's network of over 4,700 participating dealers in North
America as of March 31, 2001, of which approximately 3,500 are Autobytel.com(R)
dealers and approximately 1,200 are CarSmart.com(SM) dealers, with each dealer
representing a particular vehicle make. Approximately 400 dealers subscribe to
both the Autobytel and CarSmart services. Dealers participate in Autobytel's
network by entering into non-exclusive contracts with Autobytel. Autobytel
expects its dealers to promptly provide a haggle-free, competitive offer. Fees
paid by participating dealers constitute the majority of Autobytel's revenues.

     Consumers can purchase pre-owned vehicles through Autobytel's Pre-Owned
CyberStore. The Pre-Owned CyberStore allows consumers to search for a pre-owned
vehicle according to the price, make, model, color, year and location of the
vehicle. The CyberStore locates and displays the description, location and, if
available, actual photograph of vehicles that satisfy the consumer's search
parameters.

     Autobytel's MyGarage service area is designed to empower consumers by
providing cost effective and efficient processes for dealing with common service
and maintenance issues. The site enhances consumer personalization and includes
key components such as access to Autobytel Accredited Service Centers, the
ability to schedule service and maintenance appointments online and receive
information such as service reminders and recall information.

     Consumers can also apply for and receive insurance, financing, leasing and
warranty proposals as well as other services and information through Autobytel's
Web sites. In an arrangement with Peoplefirst Autobytel provides consumers with
access to competitive loan rates. Autobytel also provides a link on its Web
sites so consumers can receive real-time quotes for insurance coverage from
Channelpoint Corporation and submit quote applications online. Participants in
the program include The Hartford (Hartford Financial Services Group, Inc.), The
GE Auto Insurance Program and Ekemper.

     In 1999 and 2000, Autobytel established joint ventures and entered into
licensing agreements in Europe, Japan and Australia and is exploring additional
opportunities in Europe, Asia and Latin America. Autobytel receives fees from
licensing agreements.

     In February 2000, Autobytel acquired A.I.N. Corporation, the owner of
CarSmart, one of the leading online buying sites for new and pre-owned vehicles,
for 1.8 million shares of Autobytel common stock and $3 million in cash. As of
March 31, 2001, CarSmart had approximately 1,200 dealers, established
relationships with more than 200 credit unions and strategic marketing
agreements with several of the top Internet portals, including AOL.com, Alta
Vista and GO2Net. Autobytel is currently in the process of integrating the
executive and administrative personnel of CarSmart into its operations.
Autobytel continues to operate CarSmart as a separate Web site, and Autobytel
has not yet determined whether it will integrate it into the Autobytel Web site
in the future.

     In January 2001, Autobytel introduced iManager(SM), a multi-functional
dealer management system and an upgrade of its Dealer Real Time(R) system.
Autobytel is converting the Autobytel dealers from the Dealer Real Time system
to iManager. The iManager system provides dealers with immediate purchase

request information for new and pre-owned vehicles, the ability to track
multiple customers and purchase requests, turnkey customer retention programs,
automatic uploading of new and pre-owned vehicle inventory into Autobytel's
database, reporting systems, including transaction status, customer information
and Internet department performance, and other features. The CarSmart dealers
use a dealer system called SmarTrack.

     In February 2001, Autobytel signed an agreement with General Motors
Corporation (GM) to conduct a 90-day test of a new GM online locate-to-order
business model. The model involves modification of Autobytel's existing Web site
for consumers from the Washington, D.C. metropolitan area. The test program,
which commenced on May 1, 2001, combines the independent all makes, all models
capability of Autobytel with a dealer-set online e-price and locate-to-order
vehicle inventory model for Chevrolet vehicles.

     In May 2001, as part of a periodic review of its business lines, Autobytel
decided to suspend operations of its locate-to-order service, AutobytelDIRECT.
Autobytel believes that the program was unable to attain the scale required to
be profitable. In the future, Autobytel may reintroduce a locate-to-order
service depending on market conditions.

     Autobytel is a Delaware corporation incorporated on May 17, 1996. It was
previously formed in Delaware in January 1995 as a limited liability company
under the name Auto-By-Tel LLC. Autobytel's principal corporate offices are
located in Irvine, California. Autobytel completed its initial public offering
in March 1999 and its common stock is listed on the Nasdaq National Market under
the symbol "ABTL."

BACKGROUND

     Growth of the Internet and Online Commerce. The Web and online services
have emerged as significant global communications and commercial media enabling
millions of people worldwide to share information, communicate and conduct
business electronically. Autobytel believes that the number of Web users will
grow based on a number of factors, including the large and growing base of
installed personal computers in the home and workplace, the decreasing cost of
personal computers, easier, faster and cheaper access to the Internet, the
distribution of broadband applications, the proliferation of Internet content
and the increasing familiarity and acceptance of the Internet by businesses and
consumers.

     The growth in the use of the Internet has also led to a rapid growth of
online commerce. Web commerce sites are enabling businesses to target and manage
a broad customer base and establish and maintain ongoing direct customer
relationships. As a growing number of businesses and information providers have
begun marketing on the Web, it has rapidly become a medium in which consumers
can access a vast amount of information regarding the pricing, quality and
specification of products. Additionally, online transactions can be faster, less
expensive and more convenient than transactions conducted in person or over the
telephone.

     The Automotive Vehicle Market. Automotive dealers operate in localized
markets and face significant state regulations and increasing business
pressures. These fragmented markets, with approximately 47,000 dealers in
aggregate, are characterized by:

     - a perceived overabundance of dealerships,

     - competitive sales within regional markets,

     - increasing advertising and marketing costs that continue to reduce dealer
       profits,

     - high-pressure sales tactics with consumers, and

     - large investments by dealers in real estate, construction, personnel and
       other overhead expenses.

     In addition, consumers have traditionally entered into the highly
negotiated sales process with relatively little information regarding
manufacturer's costs, leasing costs, financing costs, relative specifications
and other important information. Buying a vehicle is considered to be one of the
most significant purchases a United States consumer makes. According to Manheim
Auctions, approximately

$744 billion and $702 billion was spent on new and pre-owned vehicles in the
United States representing the sale of approximately 59 million and 58 million
vehicles in 2000 and 1999, respectively. Although automotive retailing attracts
significant consumer dollars, Autobytel believes that consumers associate the
traditional vehicle buying experience with high-pressure sales tactics.

THE AUTOBYTEL.COM SOLUTION

     Autobytel believes that its online products and services improve the
vehicle purchasing process for both consumers and dealers. Autobytel offers
consumers information-rich Web sites, numerous tools to configure this
information, and a quality fulfillment experience. As part of the fulfillment
experience, Autobytel expects its dealers to provide competitive price quotes
for new and pre-owned vehicles. Autobytel believes its services enable dealers
to reduce personnel and marketing costs, increase consumer satisfaction and
increase customer volume.

     Benefits to Consumers. Autobytel's Web sites provide consumers free of
charge up-to-date specifications and pricing information on vehicles. In
addition, Autobytel's consumers gain easy access to valuable automotive
information, such as dealer invoice pricing and tools consisting of a lease
calculator, a loan calculator to determine monthly payments and a lease or buy
decision assistant. Autobytel's database of articles allows consumers to perform
online library research by accessing documents such as weekly automotive
reports, consumer reviews and manufacturer brochures. Various automotive
information service providers, such as Edmund's, Kelley Blue Book, Pace
Publication's Carprice.com and IntelliChoice, are also available on Autobytel's
Web site to assist consumers with specific vehicle and related automotive
decisions such as insurance and financing. Armed with such information, the
consumer should be more confident and capable of making an informed and
intelligent vehicle buying decision.

     Autobytel believes it offers consumers a significantly different vehicle
purchasing experience from that of traditional methods. Consumers using
Autobytel's Web sites are able to shop for a vehicle, and make financing and
insurance decisions from the convenience of their own home or office. Autobytel
expects dealers to provide consumers a haggle-free price quote within 24 hours
and a high level of customer service. Autobytel forms its dealer relationships
after careful analysis of automotive sales and demographic data in each region.
Autobytel seeks to include in its dealer network the highest quality dealers
within defined territories.

     Benefits to Dealers. Autobytel believes it benefits dealers by reducing the
dealers' incremental personnel and marketing costs, increasing consumer
satisfaction and increasing sales volume. Through Autobytel's investment in
national advertising and brand recognition of Autobytel and CarSmart, it
attracts consumers to Autobytel's Web sites and, based on the consumers'
preference, Autobytel directs them to dealers in their local area. Autobytel
believes this provides dealers access to a larger number of prequalified
consumers. Autobytel believes dealers' personnel costs should be reduced because
Autobytel provides dealers access to potential purchasers who have completed
their research and should be ready to buy or lease a vehicle. As a result,
reaching these consumers and selling or leasing them vehicles costs the dealer
little or no additional overhead expense other than the fees paid to Autobytel
and the personnel costs of a dedicated manager. Through Autobytel's iManager and
Dealer Real Time systems, Autobytel provides dealers with on-site technology to
better track sales, inventory, customer solicitations, responses and other
communications.

     By providing consumers a quality fulfillment experience, Autobytel seeks to
provide its dealers a large number of consumers, which allows them to compete
more effectively. Autobytel's solution includes a network of over 4,700
participating dealers in the United States and Canada, as of March 31, 2001,
representing every major domestic and imported make of vehicles and light
trucks.

     To incent a dealer to participate in the Autobytel or CarSmart network,
Autobytel allocates each dealer an exclusive geographic territory in such
network based upon specific vehicle make. A territory allocated by Autobytel to
a dealer is generally larger than a territory assigned to a dealer by a
manufacturer.

     Autobytel's Web Sites. Because Web sites can be continually updated and
provide a large quantity of quality information, Autobytel believes the Internet
offers the most efficient medium for consumers to learn about and shop for
vehicles. The Internet's global reach to consumers allows Autobytel to leverage
its investment in branding and marketing across a very large national and
international audience to create qualified purchase requests for vehicles. For
these reasons, Autobytel also believes that the Internet represents the most
efficient method of directing purchase requests to local markets and dealers.

     Autobytel currently provides the following services on its Autobytel.com
Web site:

STRATEGY

     Autobytel's primary objective is to connect buyers and sellers in an
information-rich environment throughout the vehicle ownership lifecycle.
Autobytel intends to achieve this objective through the following principal
strategies:

     Continue to Build Brand Equity. Autobytel believes that due to its focus on
both online and traditional marketing, it owns two of the leading brand names in
its sector. Autobytel intends to continue to market and advertise to enhance its
brand recognition with consumers. Autobytel believes that continuing to
strengthen brand awareness of the Autobytel and CarSmart names among consumers
is critical to attract vehicle buyers, increase purchase requests and, in turn,
maintain and increase the size of Autobytel's dealer base. Autobytel intends to
continue advertising on the Internet and through traditional media, such as
television, radio and print publications.

     Ensure the Highest Quality Consumer Experience. Autobytel believes that
consumer satisfaction and loyalty is heavily influenced by the consumer's
experience with its sites and with its dealers. In order to enhance Autobytel's
appeal to consumers, Autobytel intends to continue developing its Web sites by
enhancing vehicle information and personalization. Autobytel formed I-Net
Training Technologies LLC with third parties to provide dealers with more
extensive training and tools to facilitate Internet selling of vehicles. In
addition, Autobytel plans to continue compiling high quality content from third
party sources on its sites, including information from Edmund's, IntelliChoice,
Carprices.com and Kelley Blue Book. Autobytel believes that consumer
satisfaction with the vehicle purchasing experience is also essential to its
success and the differentiation of its services from those of its competitors.
Autobytel intends to continue to invest in its dealer training and support
services to ensure a consistent, high-quality alternative to the traditional
vehicle buying process.

     Increase Purchase Requests. Autobytel believes that increasing the volume
and quality of purchase requests directed from its Web sites to its dealer
networks is crucial to the long-term growth and success of Autobytel's business.
By augmenting the volume of quality purchase requests, Autobytel expects to
attract additional dealers to Autobytel's networks, increase fees paid by
dealers, and solidify its relationships with participating dealers. Autobytel's
strategy for increasing traffic to its sites and the number of purchase requests
includes forming and maintaining online sponsorships and alliances with Internet
portals and with Internet automotive information providers. As part of
Autobytel's strategy to improve the quality of purchase requests, Autobytel
continues to expand the breadth and depth of information and services available
through Autobytel's Web sites so that well informed, ready-to-buy consumers can
be directed to participating dealers.

     Expand and Improve Dealer Network. Autobytel believes that strengthening
the size and quality of its dealer networks is important to the success and
growth of Autobytel's business. Autobytel's strategy is to increase the size of
its dealer networks by attracting new dealers and strengthening relationships
with existing dealers by:

     - increasing the volume and quality of purchase requests,

     - advertising in trade publications aimed at dealers and participating in
       industry trade shows,

     - maintaining Autobytel's extensive training and support programs to
       participating dealers, and

     - providing Autobytel's iManager, Dealer Real Time or SmarTrack systems, as
       applicable, to all participating dealers.

     Invest in Related Products and Services. Autobytel believes that expanding
its products and services to both consumers and dealers is critical to establish
itself as the premier provider of online automotive products and services.
Autobytel's strategy is to continue to enhance personalization features and
invest in related products and services, such as the CyberStore, maintenance and
service, and warranty, finance and insurance services. The iManager, Dealer Real
Time and SmarTrack systems will allow Autobytel to launch new products and
services for Autobytel's dealers. Autobytel also allows dealers to offer
accessories directly through its Web sites. Autobytel expanded the advertising
sales on its Web sites and marketed the

information in its database in accordance with its privacy policy. Autobytel
expects to further expand these businesses.

     Expand Internationally. Autobytel intends to continue its international
expansion through licensing agreements and joint ventures with local strategic
investors. In January 2000, Autobytel.Europe LLC and Autobytel entered into an
operating agreement with Inchcape plc, Pon Holdings B.V. and GE Capital Equity
Holdings, Inc. to expand its existing operations and business throughout Europe.
Autobytel licensed its technology, business processes and trade name to
Autobytel.Europe on a royalty free perpetual basis and contributed to
Autobytel.Europe its existing license agreements for the United Kingdom and
Scandinavia and Finland. In turn, Autobytel.Europe intends to license such
technology, business processes and trade name to other national operating
companies in European countries. Autobytel.Europe will usually invest in such
national operating companies or obtain options to acquire equity positions in
such companies. Autobytel.Europe currently has licensing agreements for the
United Kingdom, Sweden, Spain and The Netherlands and intends to establish
licensing agreements in Germany, France and Italy as well as certain other
countries in Western and Eastern Europe. Autobytel has also established joint
ventures in Japan and Australia with several strategic investors. Autobytel is
currently exploring additional opportunities in Asia and Latin America.

PRODUCTS, PROGRAMS AND SERVICES

     New Vehicle Purchasing Service. Autobytel's new vehicle purchasing service
enables consumers to shop for and select a new vehicle through its Web sites by
providing research on new vehicles such as pricing, features, specifications and
colors. When consumers indicate they are ready to buy a vehicle, a consumer can
complete a purchase request online, which specifies the type of vehicle and
accessories the consumer desires, along with the consumer's contact information.
The purchase request is then routed by Autobytel to the nearest participating
dealer that sells the type of vehicle requested, and Autobytel promptly returns
an e-mail message to the consumer with the dealership's name and phone number
and the name of the dedicated manager at the dealership. Dealers agree in their
contracts to contact the consumer within 24 hours of receiving the purchase
request with a firm, haggle-free price quote for the requested vehicle. When
consumers complete their purchase, they usually take delivery of their vehicle
at the dealership showroom. Generally, within 14 days of the submission of a
consumer's purchase request, Autobytel contacts the consumer again by e-mail to
conduct a quality assurance survey that allows Autobytel to evaluate the sales
process at participating dealers and improve the quality of dealer service.

     Autobytel's network had over 4,700 dealers as of March 31, 2001, which
represents a decline from the number of dealers Autobytel had as of December 31,
2000, of which approximately 3,500 are Autobytel dealers and approximately 1,200
are CarSmart dealers. Approximately 400 dealers subscribe to both the
Autobytel.com and CarSmart.com services. These dealers represent every major
domestic and imported make of vehicle and light truck sold in the United States
and Canada. Dealerships are charged initial subscription fees and on-going fees,
principally on a monthly basis.

     Pre-Owned CyberStore. Autobytel launched its CyberStore program in April
1997. The CyberStore allows consumers to search for a certified or non-certified
pre-owned vehicle according to specific search parameters such as the price,
make, model, mileage, year and location of the vehicle. CyberStore locates and
displays the description, location and, if available, actual digital photograph
of vehicles that satisfy the search parameters. The consumer can then complete a
formal purchase request for a specific vehicle and is contacted by the dealer to
conclude the sale. To be listed in the CyberStore a certified pre-owned vehicle
must pass an extensive inspection and be covered by a 72-hour money-back
guarantee and a three-month, 3,000-mile warranty, which is honored nationally by
certified Pre-Owned CyberStore dealers. Autobytel charges each vehicle dealer
that participates in the CyberStore program a separate additional monthly fee.
The CyberStore program uses the iManager and Dealer Real Time systems to provide
participating dealers online purchase requests shortly after submission by
consumers as well as the ability to track their inventory on a real-time basis.

     Service and Maintenance. In June 1999, Autobytel launched a comprehensive
site designed to facilitate the service process for consumers. The site is
designed to empower consumers with cost effective and efficient processes for
dealing with common service and maintenance issues. The site enhances consumer
personalization. It includes key components such as access to Autobytel
Accredited Service Centers and the ability to schedule service and maintenance
appointments online. At the My Garage area consumers can store and receive
information about their cars and trucks, such as service reminders, recall
information and a lease watch to help keep track of mileage on a leased vehicle.
The site offers "Ask the Expert", a section that offers answers to frequently
asked service and maintenance questions. In addition, the site offers travel and
weather information as well as maps.

     Participating service centers must commit to respond to consumers within 24
hours with competitive no-haggle service prices. The site enables dealers to use
the Internet to further serve their customers.

     Other Related Products and Services. Autobytel offers a number of related
products and services that it markets to consumers through its Web sites and the
linked Web sites of participating third party providers. Autobytel makes
purchase and lease financing available to consumers through Peoplefirst that
allow consumers to research and apply for vehicle financing online in a secure
manner. Consumers can apply for a loan or lease online at the time they submit
their purchase request for either a new or pre-owned vehicle. Consumers are able
to arrive at the dealership with their loan pre-approved and their credit
verification documents in hand. Autobytel believes that the convenience of
pre-approved purchase or lease financing, combined with a firm, competitive
price, enables dealers more easily to consummate purchase requests. Peoplefirst
pays Autobytel a referral fee and an origination fee for most loans.

     Autobytel provides a link on its Web sites so consumers can receive
real-time quotes for insurance coverage from Channelpoint Corporation and submit
quote applications online. Participants in the program include The Hartford
(Hartford Financial Services Group, Inc.), The GE Auto Insurance Program and
Ekemper. As of March 31, 2001, the service was available to consumers in 37
states and the District of Columbia. Autobytel typically receives a marketing
fee for every quote application sent to a participating insurance company or
agent by a consumer accessing the Channelpoint Web site through its Web sites.
In addition, Autobytel provides Warrantybynet Inc.'s warranty products and
receive fees per warranty sold.

     Autobytel offers information concerning all aspects of owning and leasing
new and pre-owned vehicles that it believes makes its Web sites valuable
resources to consumers. Autobytel also offers a lease calculator and a loan
calculator to determine monthly payments and a lease or buy decision tool.

     The iManager System. In 1997, Autobytel launched a proprietary technology
and software system called the Dealer Real Time system. The Dealer Real Time
system is an Internet-based communications platform that gives dealers a
competitive advantage compared to delivering purchase requests by fax. In
January 2001 Autobytel launched iManager, an upgrade of the Dealer Real Time
system.

     Using Internet technology, the iManager system enables the dealer to:

     - instantaneously access a consumer's vehicle purchase request as soon as
       the consumer submits it online,

     - consolidate Internet leads from multiple sources and showroom traffic in
       a single application,

     - track all interaction with the consumer,

     - accelerate dealer response time to consumers' online vehicle purchase
       requests,

     - send e-mail to consumers using a variety of predetermined templates,

     - access purchase requests through web-enabled cellular phones and wireless
       handheld devices,

     - input new and used vehicle inventory information for immediate display to
       consumers on Autobytel Web pages,

     - track dealership performance through a series of reports available
       online,

     - access Autobytel "news" and product information online, and

     - contact Autobytel technical support personnel via e-mail links.

     CarSmart dealers use the SmarTrack dealer system. Autobytel is currently
evaluating whether to standardize all of its dealers on a single system.

INTERNATIONAL ACTIVITIES

     Autobytel has established and intends to further expand its presence in
foreign markets through licensing agreements and by establishing relationships
with vehicle dealers and strategic investors located in foreign markets.

     Europe. Autobytel established Autobytel.Europe with strategic investors to
expand its operations in Europe. Autobytel licensed its technology, business
processes and trade name to Autobytel.Europe on a royalty free perpetual basis
and contributed to Autobytel.Europe its existing license agreements for the
United Kingdom and Scandinavia and Finland. Autobytel.Europe intends to license
such technology, business processes and trade name to national operating
companies in European countries. Autobytel.Europe will generally invest in such
national operating companies or obtain options to acquire equity positions in
such companies. Autobytel.Europe also intends to offer joint services to such
companies to localize the Autobytel offerings while building its brand name
among consumers in individual countries as well as on a Pan-European and
regional basis. The strategic investors in Autobytel.Europe are GE Capital
Equity Holdings, Inc., Inchcape plc, the United Kingdom's largest independent
importer and distributor of motor vehicles, Pon Holdings B.V., a major
distributor of vehicles in The Netherlands, e-LaSer, a leader in customer
services and e-commerce in Europe and a subsidiary of Galeries Lafayette Group

owned 77% of Autobytel.Europe.

     The license agreement with Auto-by-Tel UK limited, a subsidiary of Inchcape
plc, is a 20-year exclusive agreement to license Autobytel's technology,
business processes and trade name in the United Kingdom, as well as provide
maintenance and development for such technology. The license agreement with
Auto-By-Tel AB is a similar 10-year exclusive agreement for Sweden. The United
Kingdom and Swedish sites were launched in April 1999. As of March 31, 2001,
Autobytel.Europe owned 15% of Auto-By-Tel AB. Autobytel.Europe entered into
10-year exclusive license agreements for The Netherlands and Spain. The
Netherlands and Spanish sites were launched in February 2001. Autobytel.Europe
intends to establish licensing agreements in Germany, France and Italy as well
as other countries in Western and Eastern Europe.

     Japan. In June 1999 Autobytel established Autobytel Japan Kabushiki Kaisha
with six Japanese investors. Autobytel entered into a 10-year exclusive
agreement with Autobytel Japan to license its technology, business processes and
trade name in Japan. The strategic investors in Autobytel Japan are ITOCHU
Corporation, a global trading company with approximately $110 billion in
revenue; Intec, Inc., a leading independent systems integrator and network
service provider with its own infrastructure in Japan; e-solutions, inc., an
e-commerce solutions provider from business plan to implementation; Recruit Co.,
Ltd., the publisher of Japan's most widely recognized auto-related magazine;
Orient Corporation, a leading consumer finance company in Japan; and
TransCosmos, a leading network services company in Japan. GE Capital is also an
investor in Autobytel Japan. Autobytel Japan launched its Web site in November
1999. As of March 31, 2001, Autobytel owned 26% of Autobytel Japan.

     Australia. In February 2000 Autobytel established autobytel Australia Pty
Limited with six Australian investors. Autobytel entered into a 10-year
exclusive agreement with Autobytel Australia to license its technology, business
processes and trade name in Australia as well as to localize the Autobytel
offerings for the Australian market. The strategic investors in Australia are
St. George Bank Limited, one of Australia's largest banks with over 20 years
experience in the automotive finance industry; Trading Post, Australia's largest
print and online used car market; Astre Automotive, Australia's largest vehicle
distributor and importer; RACV (Royal Automobile Club of Victoria), with
approximately 1.3 million

members; Fortis Insurance, one of Australia's largest automotive insurance

in e-commerce sales of auto accessories with extensive automotive e-commerce
knowledge. Autobytel Australia launched its Web site in October 2000. As of
March 31, 2001, Autobytel owned 30% of Autobytel Australia.

     Canada. Through Autobytel's wholly-owned subsidiary, Autobytel.ca inc.,
Autobytel launched Autobytel.ca in Canada in 1998. As of March 31, 2001,
approximately 200 Canadian dealerships belonged to Autobytel's network.

     Expansion Opportunities. Autobytel is currently exploring additional
opportunities in Europe, Asia and Latin America.

     Revenues from Autobytel's customers outside of the United States were less
than 10% of total revenues for the years ended December 31, 2000 and December
31, 1999.

MARKETING AND SALES

     Autobytel's ability to enhance the recognition of its brand names,
domestically and internationally, and position itself as a leading
Internet-based vehicle information and automotive services provider is important
to its efforts to increase the number of vehicle purchase requests and requests
for ancillary services, as well as the number and quality of subscribing
dealerships. Over the past several years, Autobytel has been the subject of
numerous newspaper, magazine, radio and television stories. Articles about its
new vehicle program have appeared in Business Week, Fortune, Forbes, Time, and
The Wall Street Journal, among other publications. Television stories featuring
Autobytel have been aired nationally on all major television networks. Autobytel
believes that ongoing media coverage is an important element in creating
consumer awareness of its brand names and has contributed to dealership
awareness of, and participation in, Autobytel's programs.

     Autobytel has established marketing and advertising programs with many of
the leading automotive information providers on the Internet, including
Edmund's, IntelliChoice and Kelley Blue Book which direct traffic to its Web
site and increase purchase requests. Autobytel's agreements with automotive
information providers typically have a term of one year.

     In the first quarter of 2001 and the year 2000, approximately 33% and 17%
of Autobytel's total purchase requests originated from StoneAge Corporation,
respectively. Autobytel's agreement with StoneAge, pursuant to which it receives
referrals from StoneAge's Web site, is scheduled to expire in March 2002.
StoneAge provides Autobytel with the largest number of purchase requests other
than consumers visiting the Autobytel Web site directly. Autobytel pays StoneAge
based on a per purchase request basis.

     Autobytel's agreement with NBC Internet provides for anchor tenancy in the
New Car Center on its Web site, NBCi.com, as well as other promotions on its Web
site. The agreement also provides for a co-branded Web site. The agreement is
for a term of three years expiring in March 2002. Autobytel pays NBCi annual and
monthly fees.

     As of March 31, 2001, the aggregate minimum future payments under
Autobytel's agreements with Internet portals was $10.5 million.

     During the first quarter of 2001 and the year 2000, Autobytel's total
Internet marketing and advertising costs incurred were $6.2 million and $20.6
million, respectively. Annual, monthly and variable fees were $0.2 million, $1.5
million, and $4.5 million, respectively, in the first quarter of 2001 and $0.6
million, $7.5 million and $12.0 million, respectively, in the year 2000. Setup
and initial fees in the year 2000 were $0.5 million.

     Autobytel supplements its Internet presence with television, radio and
print advertising. In late 1996, Autobytel began to broaden its marketing
efforts with a campaign to accelerate consumer awareness of the Autobytel brand
name and drive traffic to its Web site through cable television advertisements
featured on

CNN and CNET, Inc. and network television advertisements featured on NBC and
MSNBC. Autobytel expects to continue to use television advertising to strengthen
its brand awareness.

     In addition to Autobytel's consumer-oriented marketing activities, it also
markets its programs directly to dealerships, participates in trade shows,
advertises in trade publications and major automotive magazines and encourages
subscribing dealerships to recommend its program to other dealerships.

INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY

     Autobytel has registered service marks, including "Auto-By-Tel",
"Autobytel.com" and its "Autobytel.com logo" and has applied for additional
service marks and numerous patents. Autobytel regards its trademarks, service
marks and brand names as important to its business.

DEALER RELATIONSHIPS AND SERVICES

     Dealer Network. Dealers participate in Autobytel's networks by entering
into contracts with Autobytel. Autobytel is converting its dealers to new
contracts with one-year terms that are terminable on 30 days' notice by either
party. Autobytel's dealerships are located in most major metropolitan areas in
the United States and Canada. As of March 31, 2001, the Autobytel participating
dealership base totaled approximately 3,500 dealers. Dealerships pay initiation
and monthly fees to subscribe to Autobytel's online marketing program. Both the
initial and monthly subscription fees are established in the contract and are
based upon many business factors including the type and location of the
franchise. Autobytel reserves the right to raise its fees to dealers upon 30
days notice after the first six months of the term. Autobytel does not prevent
dealers from entering into agreements with its competitors.

     CarSmart's dealer agreements are generally for a term of three years and
are terminable on 30 days' notice by CarSmart. As of March 31, 2001, the
CarSmart participating dealership base totaled approximately 1,200 dealers.
CarSmart's dealers pay initial, annual and monthly subscription fees. CarSmart
reserves the right to revise fees after six months. CarSmart is converting its
dealers to new contracts with one year terms and no annual fees.

     As of March 31, 2001, dealers that participated in both the Autobytel and
CarSmart new vehicle purchasing services totaled approximately 400.

     Customer Support. Autobytel actively monitors subscribing dealers through
ongoing customer surveys, and research conducted by its internal dealer support
group. Generally, within 14 days after a consumer submits a purchase request
through one of Autobytel's Web sites, Autobytel re-contacts the consumer by
e-mail requesting completion of a quality assurance survey that allows Autobytel
to evaluate the sales process at participating dealers. Additionally, Autobytel
performs telephone surveys of its customers to further support the information
gained from the written quality assurance surveys. Dealerships that fail to
abide by Autobytel's program guidelines or who generate repeated consumer
complaints are reviewed and, if appropriate, terminated. In return for requiring
a high level of consumer service, Autobytel assigns participating dealerships
exclusive territories. Autobytel tries to assign dealers attractive territories
in order to increase participation in its program.

     Each dealer agreement obligates the dealers to adhere to Autobytel's policy
of providing prompt responses to customers, no haggle pricing and full
disclosure regarding vehicle availability, add-ons and related matters.
Autobytel requires each dealer to have a manager whose principal responsibility
is supervising its system, similar to the way in which most dealers have a new
vehicle sales manager, pre-owned vehicle sales manager and service and parts
department managers who are responsible for those dealership functions.
Autobytel reserves the right to reduce or modify each dealer's assigned
territory after the first six months, although there can be no assurance that a
dealer whose territory is reduced or modified will not contest such a change or
terminate its subscription. Autobytel cannot be sure that dealers whose
territories are reduced or modified by it will not pursue legal action against
it in an effort to prevent the change or recover damages.

     Training. Autobytel believes that dealers and their employees require
specialized training to learn the skills necessary to serve the Internet user
and take full advantage of Autobytel's proprietary systems. Therefore, Autobytel
has developed an extensive training program for its dealers. Autobytel believes
that this training is critical to enhancing its brand and reputation. Autobytel
requires participating dealerships to have their representatives trained on its
system. Training is conducted at Autobytel's headquarters in Irvine, California,
at regional training centers and at dealerships' premises. In training its
dealers, Autobytel de-emphasizes traditional vehicle selling techniques and
emphasizes the Autobytel approach. To increase consumer satisfaction and reduce
costs, Autobytel seeks to discourage dealerships from using commissioned and
multiple salespersons to interface with its customers. In October 1999,
Autobytel formed I-Net Training Technologies LLC with third parties to provide
dealers with more extensive training and tools to facilitate Internet selling of
vehicles. Such services are provided for a fee.

COMPETITION

     Autobytel believes that the principal competitive factors affecting the
market for Internet-based vehicle marketing services include:

     - brand name recognition,

     - speed and quality of fulfillment,

     - variety of related products and services,

     - ease of use,

     - customer satisfaction,

     - quality of service, and

     - technical expertise.

     Autobytel's vehicle purchasing services compete against a variety of
Internet and traditional vehicle buying services, automotive brokers and
classifieds. Many of such competitors are substantially better financed than
Autobytel is. In the Internet-based market, Autobytel competes with other
entities which maintain similar commercial Web sites including AutoVantage,
Microsoft Corporation's CarPoint, CarsDirect.com, Cars.com and AutoTrader.com.
AutoNation, a large consolidator of dealers, has a Web site for marketing
vehicles. Autobytel also competes indirectly against vehicle brokerage firms and
affinity programs offered by several companies, including Costco Wholesale
Corporation and Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. In addition, all major vehicle
manufacturers have their own Web sites and many have launched online buying
services, such as General Motors Corporation's BuyPower and Ford Motor Company's
FordDirect.com.

     Autobytel also competes with vehicle insurers, lenders and lessors as well
as individual dealerships. Such companies may already maintain or may introduce
Web sites which compete with Autobytel's. Autobytel cannot assure that it can
compete successfully against current or future competitors, many of which have
substantially more capital, resources and access to additional financing than it
does, nor can there be any assurance that competitive pressures faced by
Autobytel will not result in increased marketing costs, decreased Web site
traffic or loss of market share or otherwise will not materially and adversely
affect its business, results of operations and financial condition. Autobytel
competes primarily on brand name recognition acquired through early entry into
the Internet-based automotive purchase referral market and through customer and
dealer satisfaction.

OPERATIONS AND TECHNOLOGY

     Autobytel believes that its future success is significantly dependent upon
its ability to continue to deliver high-performance and reliable Web sites,
enhance consumer/dealer communications, maintain the highest levels of
information privacy and ensure transactional security. Autobytel currently hosts
its Web site at its data center. Its data center includes redundant
infrastructure and network connections and is

located at Autobytel's headquarters in Irvine, California. In the future,
Autobytel may host its infrastructure at a leading Application Service Provider.
Autobytel's network and computer systems are built on the leading industry
standards. Network security is provided by utilizing standard products.
CarSmart's site is hosted by a third party.

     System enhancements are primarily intended to accommodate increased traffic
across Autobytel's Web sites, improve the speed in which purchase requests are
processed and introduce new and enhanced products and services. System
enhancements entail the implementation of sophisticated new technology and
system processes.

GOVERNMENT REGULATION

     Currently few laws or regulations have been adopted that apply directly to
Internet business activities. The adoption of additional local, state, national
or international laws or regulations may decrease the growth of Internet usage
or the acceptance of Internet commerce.

     Autobytel believes that its dealer marketing services do not constitute
franchising or vehicle brokerage activity in a way that makes franchise, motor
vehicle dealer, or vehicle broker licensing laws applicable to Autobytel.
Through a subsidiary, Autobytel is licensed as a motor vehicle dealer and
broker. However, if individual state regulatory requirements change or
additional requirements are imposed on Autobytel, it may be required to modify
its service programs in such a state in a manner which may undermine its
program's attractiveness to consumers or dealers or not offer such service or
terminate its operations in such a state. As Autobytel introduces new services,
it may need to comply with additional licensing regulations and regulatory
requirements.

     Autobytel's services may result in changes in the way vehicles are
currently sold or may be viewed as threatening by new and pre-owned vehicle
dealers who do not subscribe to its programs. Such businesses are often
represented by influential lobbying organizations, and such organizations or
other persons may propose legislation that, if adopted, could impact Autobytel's
evolving marketing and distribution model.

     Other countries to which Autobytel expands its operations may have laws or
be subject to treaties that regulate the marketing, distribution, and sale of
vehicles. As Autobytel considers specific foreign operations, it will need to
determine whether the laws of the countries in which it seeks to operate require
it to modify its program or otherwise change the Autobytel system or prohibit
the use of the system in such country entirely. In addition, the laws of a
foreign country may impose licensing, bonding or similar requirements on
Autobytel as a condition to doing business there.

     To date, Autobytel has not expended significant resources on lobbying or
related government affairs issues but may be required to do so in the future.

     Franchise Classification. If Autobytel's relationship or written agreement
with its dealers was found to be a "franchise" under federal or state franchise
laws, Autobytel could be subjected to additional regulations, including but not
limited to licensing, increased reporting and disclosure requirements.
Compliance with varied laws, regulations, and enforcement characteristics found
in each state may require Autobytel to allocate both staff time and monetary
resources, each of which may have an adverse affect on its results of
operations. As an additional risk, if Autobytel's dealer relationship or
subscription agreement is determined to establish a franchise, Autobytel may be
subject to limitations on its ability to quickly and efficiently effect changes
in its dealer relationships in response to changing market trends, which may
negatively impact its ability to compete in the marketplace.

     Autobytel believes that neither its relationship with its subscribing
dealers nor its dealer subscription agreements themselves constitute
"franchises" under federal or state franchise laws. This belief has been upheld
by a Federal Appeals Court in Michigan that ruled Autobytel's business
relationship and its dealer subscription agreement does not rise to the level of
a "franchise" under Michigan law.

     Vehicle Brokerage Activities. Autobytel believes that state motor vehicles
dealer or broker licensing laws do not apply to it. Through a wholly-owned
subsidiary, Autobytel is licensed as a motor vehicle dealer

and broker. Autobytel may be required to pay administrative fees, fines, and
penalties for failure to comply with such licensing requirements. Autobytel
believes that its dealer marketing referral service model does not qualify as an
automobile brokerage activity.

     In response to concerns about its marketing referral program raised by the
Texas Department of Transportation, Autobytel modified its program in that state
to achieve compliance. These modifications included a unique pricing model under
which all subscribing dealerships in Texas are charged uniform fees based on the
population density of their particular geographic area and opening its program
to all dealerships who wish to apply.

     In the event that any other state's regulatory requirements impose state
specific requirements on Autobytel or include Autobytel within an
industry-specific regulatory scheme, Autobytel may be required to modify its
marketing programs in such states in a manner which may undermine the program's
attractiveness to consumers or dealers. In the alternative, if Autobytel
determines that the licensing and related requirements are overly burdensome,
Autobytel may elect to terminate operations in such state. In each case,
Autobytel's business, results of operations and financial condition could be
materially and adversely affected.

     Financing Related Activities. Autobytel provides a connection through its
Web sites that allows a consumer to obtain finance information and loan
approval. Autobytel does not demand nor does it receive any fees from consumers
for this service. In the event states require Autobytel to be licensed as a
financial broker, Autobytel intends to obtain such licenses. Autobytel may be
unable to comply with a state's regulations affecting its current operations or
newly introduced services, or it could be required to incur significant fees and
expenses to license or be compelled to discontinue finance operations in those
states.

     Insurance Related Activities. Autobytel provides a link on its Web sites so
consumers can receive real time quotes for insurance coverage from Channelpoint
Corporation and submit quote applications online. Participants in the program
include The Hartford (Hartford Financial Services Group, Inc.), The GE Auto
Insurance Program and Ekemper. Autobytel typically receives a marketing fee for
every quote application sent to a participating insurance company or agent by a
consumer accessing the Channelpoint Web site through Autobytel's Web sites.
Autobytel receives no premiums from consumers nor does it charge consumers fees
for its services. All applications are completed on Channelpoint's Web site.

     Autobytel does not believe that its activity requires it to be licensed
under state insurance laws. The use of the Internet in the marketing of
insurance products, however, is a relatively new practice. It is not clear
whether or to what extent state insurance licensing laws apply to activities
similar to Autobytel's. Given this uncertainty, Autobytel has proactively
applied for and currently holds, through a wholly-owned subsidiary, insurance
agent licenses or is otherwise authorized to transact insurance in 47 states and
the District of Columbia.

EMPLOYEES

     As of April 30, 2001, Autobytel had a total of 250 employees, including 12
employees of CarSmart and 25 employees of Autobytel.Europe. Autobytel also
utilizes independent contractors as required. None of Autobytel's employees are
represented by a labor union. Autobytel has not experienced any work stoppages
and considers its employee relations to be good.

PROPERTIES

     Autobytel's headquarters are located in a single office building in Irvine,
California. Autobytel occupies four floors, for a total of approximately 49,000
square feet. Each floor is leased with expiration dates ranging from September
2001 through February 2002. CarSmart's operations occupy approximately 2,700
square feet in a single office building in San Ramon, California. The lease for
this office space expires in March 2003. Autobytel.Europe is located in a single
office building in The Netherlands and occupies approximately 1,800 square
meters. The lease expires in August 2005.

LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

     A.I.N. was sued on September 1, 1999 in a lawsuit entitled Robert Martins
v. Michael J. Gorun, A.I.N., Inc., et al., in Los Angeles Superior Court. The
complaint contains causes of action for breach of written and oral contracts,
promissory estoppel, breach of fiduciary duty and fraud, and seeks damages and
equitable relief. The plaintiff contends he is entitled to a 49.9% ownership
interest in A.I.N.'s CarSmart online business based on a purported agreement for
the formation of a company called CarSmart On-Line Services. On December 14,
1999, A.I.N. filed a complaint for declaratory relief on the subject of Mr.
Martins' lawsuit in Contra Costa County Superior Court. The Los Angeles action
has been transferred to Contra Costa County and the two cases have been
consolidated. Autobytel was added as a cross defendant in such action. The
lawsuit is and will be vigorously contested on behalf of Autobytel and A.I.N.

     The selling stockholders of A.I.N. are obligated to fully indemnify
Autobytel for all losses, including attorney's fees, expenses, settlements and
judgments, arising out of the lawsuit. The indemnification obligation was
initially secured by 450,000 shares of Autobytel common stock transferred to the
selling stockholders as part of the acquisition of A.I.N., as well as $250,000
in cash. As of April 30, 2001, the obligation was secured by the 373,068 shares
of common stock and $126,000 in cash after expenses.

     On July 15, 1998, Autobytel and certain of its past and current officers
were sued by former employee Thomas Heshion in a lawsuit entitled Thomas
Heshion, et al. v. Auto-By-Tel Corporation, et al. in Orange County Superior
Court. Plaintiff claimed that he was wrongfully terminated and that Autobytel
and its officers interfered with an oral agreement between plaintiff and another
co-worker for the purchase of the co-worker's Autobytel stock. Summary judgment
was granted on the claims alleging interference with the alleged stock
agreement. The remaining claims for wrongful termination were tried to a jury
which returned a verdict in December 2000 in favor of plaintiff in the amount of
$1.9 million.

     Autobytel believes the judgement is in error and has retained new counsel
to handle the post-trial motions and, if necessary, the appeal. Autobytel
intends to vigorously contest the judgment.

     From time to time, Autobytel is involved in other litigation matters
relating to claims arising out of the ordinary course of business. Autobytel is
involved in at least one such case currently. Autobytel believes that there are
no claims or actions pending or threatened against it, the ultimate disposition
of which would have a material adverse effect on its business, results of
operations and financial condition. However, if a court or jury rules against
Autobytel and the ruling is ultimately sustained on appeal and damages are
awarded against Autobytel, such ruling could have a material and adverse effect
on its business, results of operations and financial condition.

     AUTOBYTEL MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION
                           AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

     You should read the following discussion of Autobytel's results of
operations and financial condition in conjunction with Autobytel's consolidated
financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this joint proxy
statement/prospectus. This discussion contains forward-looking statements based
on current expectations that involve risks and uncertainties. Actual results and
the timing of certain events may differ significantly from those projected in
such forward-looking statements due to a number of factors, including those
discussed in the section entitled "Risk Factors" in this joint proxy statement/
prospectus.

OVERVIEW

     Autobytel is an internationally branded online automotive commerce company
that connects buyers and sellers together in an information-rich environment
throughout the vehicle ownership lifecycle, capturing revenue at multiple
stages. Through Autobytel's Web sites, www.autobytel.com and www.carsmart.com,
consumers can research pricing, specifications and other information regarding
new and pre-owned vehicles and can purchase, finance, lease, insure, sell or
maintain their vehicles. Autobytel believes that its services provide benefits
for consumers by supplying them with information to make informed and
intelligent vehicle decisions throughout the lifecycle of vehicle ownership.
Consumers can purchase new vehicles through its dealer referral networks. In
addition, consumers can purchase pre-owned vehicles through Autobytel's
Pre-Owned CyberStore.

     In January 2000, Autobytel announced the formation of Autobytel.Europe with
initial investment from Inchcape plc, Pon Holdings B.V., GE Capital and e-LaSer.
The Netherlands-based Autobytel.Europe plans to license, invest in and offer
joint services to national operating companies throughout Europe to localize the
Autobytel offerings. In February 2000, Autobytel, St. George Bank Limited and
others joined in the formation of Autobytel Australia. The Australian investors
joining Autobytel in the online venture are Trading Post, Astre Automotive, RACV
(Royal Automobile Club of Victoria), Fortis Insurance and Strathfield
E-Ventures.

     In February 2000, Autobytel acquired A.I.N., the owner of CarSmart, a
leading online buying site for new and pre-owned vehicles, for 1.8 million
shares of Autobytel common stock and $3.0 million in cash. As of March 31, 2001,
CarSmart had approximately 1,200 dealers, established relationships with more
than 200 credit unions and strategic marketing agreements with several of the
top Internet portals, including AOL.com, Alta Vista and GO2Net. For the years
ended December 31, 1999 and 1998 CarSmart's unaudited revenues were $6.4 million
and $3.1 million, respectively. For the years ended December 31, 1999 and 1998,
CarSmart's operating expenses were $7.6 million and $4.2 million, respectively.
CarSmart's unaudited net loss for the years ended December 31, 1999 and 1998 was
$1.3 million and $1.2 million, respectively.

     In June 2000, Autobytel launched its MyGarage service area designed to
empower consumers by providing cost effective and efficient processes for
dealing with common service and maintenance issues. The site enhances consumer
personalization and includes key components such as access to Autobytel
Accredited Service Centers, the ability to schedule service and maintenance
appointments online and receive information such as service reminders and recall
information.

     In January 2001, Autobytel introduced iManager, a multi-functional dealer
management system and an upgrade of its Dealer Real Time system. The iManager
system provides dealers with immediate purchase request information for new and
pre-owned vehicles, the ability to track multiple customers and purchase
requests, turnkey customer retention programs, automatic uploading of new and
pre-owned vehicle inventory into its database, reporting systems, including
transaction status, customer information and Internet department performance,
and other features.

     In February 2001, Autobytel signed an agreement with General Motors
Corporation to conduct a 90-day test of a new GM online locate-to-order business
model. The model involves modification of

Autobytel's existing Web site for consumers from the Washington, D.C.
metropolitan area. The test program, which commenced on May 1, 2001, combines
the independent all makes, all models capability of Autobytel with a dealer-set
online e-price and locate-to-order vehicle inventory model for Chevrolet
vehicles. Autobytel expects the project to be completed in the third quarter of
2001.

     In April 2001, Autobytel entered into an acquisition agreement to acquire
Autoweb. Under the terms of the acquisition agreement, each outstanding share of
common stock of Autoweb will be exchanged for 0.3553 shares of common stock of
Autobytel. The acquisition is subject to a number of conditions, including the
approval of both the Autobytel and Autoweb stockholders. The acquisition is
expected to close in the third quarter of 2001.

     Autobytel derives the majority of its revenues from fees paid by
subscribing dealers, and it expects to be primarily dependent on its dealer
networks for revenues in the foreseeable future. Dealers using Autobytel's
services pay initial subscription fees, as well as ongoing monthly fees based,
among other things, on the size of territory, demographics and indirectly, the
transmittal of purchase requests to them. In the first quarter of 2001 and 2000,
program fees were $12.9 million and $12.1 million, respectively. Program fees
were $12.9 million in the first quarter of 2001 and $54.0 million, $35.8 million
and $22.9 million in the years 2000, 1999 and 1998, respectively. Average
monthly program fees per dealer were $880 in the first quarter of 2001 and $949,
$1,045 and $948 in 2000, 1999 and 1998, respectively.

     Autobytel's dealer contract terms generally range from one to three years.
The majority of Autobytel's contracts are for a one year term. Autobytel is
converting its remaining dealers primarily to new contracts with a one year
term. The initial subscription fee from a dealer is recognized ratably over the
first twelve months of the dealer's contract. Amortized revenues from initial
subscription fees were $0.5 million in the first quarter of 2001 and $2.8
million, $2.5 million and $2.4 million in the years 2000, 1999 and 1998,
respectively. Monthly fees are recognized in the period the service is provided.
Monthly fee revenues were $12.3 million in the first quarter of 2001 and $50.9
million, $32.8 million and $18.2 million in the years 2000, 1999 and 1998,
respectively. The amortized revenues from annual fees were $46,000 in the first
quarter of 2001 and $22,400, $0.5 million and $2.3 million in the years 2000,
1999 and 1998, respectively.

     Autobytel also derives a portion of its revenues from related products and
services on a monthly fee and per transaction basis and from international
licensing and automotive consulting agreements. In the first quarter of 2001 and
the years 2000, 1999 and 1998, revenues from related products and services were
$3.8 million, $12.5 million, $4.5 million and $0.9 million or 23%, 19%, 11% and
4% of total revenues, respectively. In the first quarter of 2001, revenues from
related products and services include $1.4 million in consulting fees related to
the GM test program. The consulting fees were accounted for using the percentage
of completion method of accounting.

     Autobytel believes its ability to increase its revenues is directly related
to the number of subscribing dealers in its networks and the average monthly
fees paid by those dealers and indirectly related to the volume of purchase
requests routed through its Web sites. Vehicle purchaser requests routed through
Autobytel's online systems were approximately 0.8 million and 0.7 million in the
first quarter of 2001 and 2000, respectively, or an increase of 20%
sequentially. Vehicle purchase requests routed through its online systems were
approximately 0.8 million, 2.9 million, 2.1 million and 1.3 million in the first
quarter of 2001 and the years 2000, 1999 and 1998, respectively, or an increase
of 20%, 39%, 56% and 74% sequentially. From inception through March 31, 2001,
Autobytel has directed approximately 8.2 million purchase requests to dealers.

     Autobytel's revenue growth has been primarily dependent on its ability to:

     - increase the number of dealers,

     - increase the average monthly fees paid by each dealer,

     - deliver quality purchase requests to its dealer networks and

     - improve the sales conversion rate of dealer leads.

     Autobytel believes its revenues in the foreseeable future will be dependent
on the above factors as well as its ability to generate revenues from related
products and services, including international licensing agreements and
transactions with automotive manufacturers.

     In the first quarter of 2001, approximately 300 dealers were added to
Autobytel's North American dealer networks and approximately 700 dealers either
terminated their affiliation with Autobytel or were terminated by Autobytel. The
net number of dealers as of March 31, 2001 decreased by 7.5% versus the same
quarter in 2000. In 2000, approximately 3,500 dealers were added to Autobytel's
North American dealer networks, including approximately 1,500 which were added
as a part of the CarSmart acquisition, and approximately 1,800 dealers either
terminated their affiliation with Autobytel or were terminated by Autobytel. The
net number of dealers as of December 31, 2000 increased by 52% over 1999. As of
March 31, 2001, approximately 400 dealers subscribed to both the Autobytel and
CarSmart services. The number of Autobytel's dealers fluctuates from time to
time and as of March 31, 2001, Autobytel had over 4,700 dealers. Autobytel's
inability or failure to reduce dealer turnover could have a material adverse
effect on Autobytel's business, results of operations and financial condition.

     Dealer participation in Autobytel's programs may terminate for various
reasons including:

     - extinction of the manufacturer brand,

     - selling of the dealer franchise,

     - termination of the franchise by the dealer,

     - termination by Autobytel, and

     - termination of Autobytel's service by the dealer.

     Because Autobytel's primary revenue source is from program fees, its
business model is significantly different from many other Internet commerce
sites. The automobiles requested through its site are sold by dealers; therefore
Autobytel derives no direct revenues from the sale of a vehicle and has no
significant cost of goods sold, no procurement, carrying or shipping costs and
no inventory risk.

     Sales and marketing costs consist primarily of:

     - Internet marketing and advertising expenses,

     - fees paid to Autobytel's Internet affiliate network of purchase request
       providers,

     - promotion and advertising expenses to build its brand awareness and
       encourage potential customers to visit its Web sites and

     - personnel and other costs associated with sales, marketing, training and
       support of Autobytel's dealer network.

     Autobytel uses Internet advertising, as well as traditional media, such as
television, radio and print. The majority of its Internet advertising is
comprised of:

     - bounty fees paid to Autobytel's affiliate network,

     - sponsorship and alliance agreements with Internet portals and

     - advertising and marketing affiliations with online automotive information
       providers.

     The Internet portals and online automotive information providers charge a
combination of set-up, initial, annual, monthly and variable fees.

     - Set-up fees are incurred for the development of the link between
       Autobytel and the Internet portal or online information provider and are
       expensed in the period the link is established.

     - Initial and annual fees are amortized over the period they relate to.

     - Monthly fees are expensed in the month they relate to.

     - Variable fees are fees paid for purchase requests and are expensed in the
       period the purchase requests are received.

     Autobytel's Internet marketing and advertising costs, including set-up,
initial, annual, monthly and variable fees, were $6.2 million, $20.6 million,
$14.3 million and $11.1 million in the first quarter of 2001 and the years 2000,
1999 and 1998, respectively. No set-up fees were incurred in the first quarter
of 2001 or 2000. Also included in sales and marketing expenses are the costs
associated with signing up new dealers and their ongoing training and support.
Sales and marketing costs are recorded as an expense in the period the service
is provided. Sales and marketing expenses have historically fluctuated
quarter-to-quarter due to varied levels of marketing and advertising and
Autobytel believes this will continue in the future.

THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2001 AND 2000

     Revenues. Autobytel's revenues increased $1.6 million, or 10%, to $16.7
million in the first quarter of 2001, compared to $15.1 million in the first
quarter of 2000. Program fees increased $0.8 million, or 6%. The increase was
primarily due to a net $1.2 million increase as a result of the timing of the
CarSmart acquisition in mid February 2000, partially offset by the effect of a
decrease in CarSmart dealer count during the period. The increase was also
partially offset by a $0.4 million, or 4%, decrease in Autobytel program fees
due to a reduction in Autobytel dealer count.

     Revenues from related products and services increases by $0.8 million, or
27%. The increase was primarily attributable to $1.4 million in consulting fees
from the GM test program recognized in the first quarter of 2001 offset by a
$0.6 million, or 20%, decrease in insurance, Web site advertising, data base
marketing and other fees. Autobytel's revenues from related products and
services accounted for

approximately 23% of revenues in the first quarter of 2001 and 20% of revenues
in the first quarter of 2000.

     Sales and Marketing. Sales and marketing expenses primarily include
advertising and marketing expenses paid to Autobytel's purchase request
providers and for developing Autobytel's brand equity, as well as personnel and
other costs associated with sales, training and support. Sales and marketing
expense decreased by approximately $3.6 million, or 21%, to $13.3 million in the
first quarter of 2001 compared to $16.9 million in the first quarter of 2000.
The decrease was primarily due to a $6.4 million, or 68%, decrease in print,
television and radio advertising partially offset by an increase in online
advertising of $2.8 million, or 82%. Autobytel continues to refine its marketing
strategy to reduce its cost of customer acquisition.

     Product and Technology Development. Product and technology development
expense decreased by $1.0 million, or 21%, to $4.0 million in the first quarter
of 2001 compared to $5.0 million in the first quarter of 2000. The decrease was
primarily due to a $1.2 million, or 73%, decrease in software development costs
which was partially offset by an increase of $0.2 million, or 5%, for additional
personnel and retention costs, both domestic and international, and Web site
data content and licensing fees. In accordance with Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 86, "Accounting for the Costs of Computer
Software to be Sold, Leased or Otherwise Marketed", Autobytel capitalized $2.3
million of software development costs in the first quarter of 2001, which were
primarily related to the enhancement of Autobytel's existing proprietary
software for use by its international licensees.

     General and Administrative. General and administrative expense was $3.6
million and $2.8 million for the first quarter of 2001 and 2000, respectively.
General and administrative expense increased by $2.8 million, or 30%. The
increase was primarily due to a $0.6 million, or 391%, increase in legal and
professional fees for general corporate expenses, and a $0.2 million, or 101%,
increase for goodwill amortization related to Autobytel's acquisition of
CarSmart in February 2000.

     Restructuring costs. Restructuring costs of $1.0 million represent expenses
related to the reorganization of Autobytel's dealer operations, including
personnel costs, elimination of duplicate facilities and the write-down of fixed
assets in the first quarter of 2001.

     Interest Income, Net. In the first quarter of 2001, interest income
decreased by $0.4 million, or 24%, compared to 2000. Interest income decreased
due to lower cash balances and interest rates.

     Foreign Currency Exchange Gain, Net. Autobytel.Europe, a subsidiary of
Autobytel, operates its business in Europe. As such, it incurs general operating
expenses and enters into transactions which require the use of local foreign
currencies. Due to foreign exchange rate fluctuations, a $0.4 million gain on
cash held in foreign currency was realized in the first quarter of 2001. Foreign
exchange transaction gains and losses in the first quarter of 2001 were $0.3
million. In the future, Autobytel may experience gains or losses attributable to
fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates.

     Equity Losses in Unconsolidated Subsidiary. Equity losses in an
unconsolidated subsidiary represent Autobytel's share of losses in its
Australian venture. The losses recognized have been limited to the amount of
Autobytel's investment.

     Income allocable to Minority Interest. Minority interest represents the
share of net income or losses attributable to the minority shareholders in
majority owned subsidiaries. In the first quarter of 2001, $0.1 million in
income related to Autobytel's subsidiary, Autobytel.Europe, was allocated to the
minority shareholders. Autobytel.Europe was wholly-owned in 1999.

2000 COMPARED TO 1999

     Revenues. Autobytel's revenues increased $26.2 million, or 65%, to $66.5
million in 2000, compared to $40.3 million in 1999. The growth in revenues was
primarily attributable to a $18.3 million, or 51%, increase in program fees from
paying dealers, including program fees of $6.1 million from CarSmart dealers.
Autobytel's revenues from related products and services accounted for
approximately 19% of

revenues in 2000 and 11% of revenues in 1999. The increase was primarily due to
additional fees from Autobytel' international license agreements, Web site
advertising, database marketing and finance and insurance products.

     Sales and Marketing. Sales and marketing expense increased by $21.1
million, or 48%, to $65.3 million in 2000 compared to $44.2 million in 1999. The
increase was primarily due to a $9.0 million, or 57%, increase in print,
television and radio advertising to build brand awareness, a $6.3 million, or
44%, increase in online advertising for increased purchase requests and
agreements with additional Internet affiliates, and a $1.3 million, or 53%,
increase in other marketing and advertising expenses. The increase in sales and
marketing was further attributable to a $4.5 million, or 39%, increase in sales,
dealer support and call center personnel to support the growth of Autobytel's
business.

     Product and Technology Development. Product and technology development
expense increased by $8.5 million, or 60%, to $22.8 million in 2000 compared to
$14.3 million in 1999. The increase was primarily due to $6.1 million for
international software development costs, and a $2.4 million, or 18%, increase
for additional personnel and retention costs, both domestic and international,
and Web site data content and licensing fees. Autobytel capitalized $3.3 million
of product and technology costs incurred in 2000.

     General and Administrative. General and administrative expense was $13.8
million and $8.6 million for 2000 and 1999, respectively. General and
administrative expense increased by $5.2 million, or 61%. The increase was
primarily due to a $2.7 million, or 78%, increase in recruiting and personnel
costs, $1.5 million for goodwill amortization related to Autobytel's acquisition
of CarSmart, and a $1.0 million, or 145%, increase in legal and general
corporate expenses.

     Interest Income, Net. In 2000, interest income increased by $2.2 million,
or 56%, compared to 1999. Interest income increased due to higher cash balances
resulting from the initial public offering late in the first quarter of 1999 and
the funding of Autobytel.Europe early in the first quarter of 2000.

     Foreign Currency Exchange Loss, Net. Autobytel.Europe, a subsidiary of
Autobytel, operates its business in Europe. As such, it incurs general operating
expenses and enters into transactions, including investments in joint ventures
and licensees, which require the use of local currencies. Accordingly,
Autobytel.Europe engaged in foreign currency exchange transactions. Due to
foreign exchange rate fluctuations, a $0.7 million loss on cash held in foreign
currency was realized in 2000. Also, based on the six month forward exchange
rate at December 31, 2000, an unrealized loss of $0.1 million was recognized on
foreign exchange forward contracts expiring in June 2001. From inception through
December 31, 2000, Autobytel.Europe's functional currency was the U.S. dollar.
On January 1, 2001, Autobytel.Europe adopted the Euro as its functional
currency. Foreign exchange transaction gains and losses in Canada were minimal.
In the future, Autobytel may experience gains or losses attributable to
fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates.

     Other Income (Expense), Net. In 2000, there were no significant
transactions included in other income (expense). Other expense in 1999 of $0.3
million consisted primarily of costs related to Autobytel's Japanese joint
venture.

     Minority Interest Losses. Minority interest losses represent the share of
net losses attributable to the minority stockholders in majority owned
subsidiaries. In 2000, $0.4 million in losses related to Autobytel's subsidiary,
Autobytel.Europe, were allocated to the minority stockholders. Autobytel.Europe
was wholly-owned in 1999.

     Income Taxes. No provision for federal income taxes has been recorded as
Autobytel's incurred net operating losses through December 31, 2000. As of
December 31, 2000, Autobytel had approximately $76.7 million of federal and
$38.2 million of state net operating loss carryforwards that Autobytel believe
are available to offset future taxable income. These carryforwards expire in
various years through 2020. Under the Tax Reform Act of 1986, the amounts of and
benefits from Autobytel's net operating loss carryforwards will be limited due
to a cumulative ownership change of more than 50% over a three year

period. Based on preliminary estimates, Autobytel believes the effect of such
limitation will not have a material adverse effect on Autobytel's business,
results of operations and financial condition.

1999 COMPARED TO 1998

     Revenues. Autobytel's revenues increased $16.5 million, or 69%, to $40.3
million in 1999, compared to $23.8 million in 1998. The growth in revenues was
primarily attributable to an increase in the net number of paying dealers and a
$97, or 10%, increase in the average monthly program fee charged to paying
dealers. The number of paying dealers increased by 937, or 39%, to 3,323 as of
December 31, 1999, compared to 2,386 as of December 31, 1998. Revenues from
related products and services accounted for approximately 11% of revenues in
1999 and 4% of revenues in 1998.

     Sales and Marketing. Sales and marketing expenses primarily include
advertising and marketing expenses paid to Autobytel's purchase request
providers and for developing Autobytel's brand equity, as well as personnel and
other costs associated with sales, training and support. Sales and marketing
expense increased by $14.2 million, or 47%, to $44.2 million in 1999 compared to
$30.0 million in 1998. The increase was primarily due to a $3.5 million, or 43%,
increase in sales expenses due to additional sales and dealer support personnel,
a $3.2 million, or 29%, increase in fees related to information search
aggregators resulting from a higher number of purchase requests, a $3.1 million,
or 52%, increase in television and radio advertising, and a $4.4 million, or
89%, increase in other advertising and marketing expenses to build brand
awareness. Autobytel expects to continue to increase its sales, advertising and
marketing expenses in the foreseeable future.

     Product and Technology Development. Product and technology development
expense primarily includes personnel costs relating to enhancing the features,
content and functionality of Autobytel's Web site and Dealer Real Time system,
as well as expenses associated with telecommunications and computer
infrastructure. Product and technology development expense increased by $5.8
million, or 67%, to $14.3 million in 1999, compared to $8.5 million in 1998. The
increase was primarily due to a $3.6 million, or 68%, increase for additional
personnel, recruiting and retention costs, both domestic and international, a
$1.0 million, or 89%, increase in technological infrastructure costs, a $0.8
million, or 217%, increase in start up and legal expenses related to the
development of international joint ventures, and a $0.4 million, or 21%,
increase related to the development of new products and services.

     General and Administrative. General and administrative expense was $8.6
million and $5.9 million in 1999 and 1998, respectively. General and
administrative expense increased by $2.7 million, or 45%. The increase was
primarily due to a $1.2 million increase in non-cash compensation expense
associated with stock options granted in the first quarter of 1999 and the
exercise of a warrant in the fourth quarter of 1999, a $0.9 million, or 420%,
increase in accounting and other public company infrastructure costs, and a non-
recurring expense of $0.6 million related to the termination of the agreement to
acquire W.G. Nichols.

     Interest Income, Net. In 1999, interest income of $3.9 million increased
486% as compared to 1998 due to higher cash balances resulting from the sale of
preferred stock late in the fourth quarter of 1998 and the initial public
offering late in the first quarter of 1999.

     Equity Losses in Unconsolidated Subsidiary. Equity losses in an
unconsolidated subsidiary represents Autobytel's share of losses in Autobytel's
Japanese joint venture. The losses recognized have been limited to the amount of
Autobytel's investment.

     Other Income (Expense), Net. In 1999, other income (expense) consists
primarily of $0.4 million of costs related to Autobytel's Japanese joint venture
as compared to a $1.4 million gain realized from the sale of Auto-by-Tel UK,
offset in part by a $0.8 million charge for the value of warrants issued to
investors in 1998.

     Income Taxes. No provision for federal income taxes has been recorded as
Autobytel incurred net operating losses through December 31, 1999. As of
December 31, 1999, Autobytel had approximately $55.5 million of federal and
$27.9 million of state net operating loss carryforwards that Autobytel believes

are available to offset future taxable income; such carryforwards expire in
various years through 2019. Under the Tax Reform Act of 1986, the amounts of and
benefits from Autobytel's net operating loss carryforwards will be limited due
to a cumulative ownership change of more than 50% over a three year period.
Based on preliminary estimates, Autobytel believes the effect of such limitation
will not have a material adverse effect on its business, results of operations
and financial condition.

STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION

     Autobytel granted stock options to purchase 146,500, 4,653,244, 2,235,598
and 1,630,340 shares of common stock during the first quarter of 2001 and years
2000, 1999 and 1998, respectively. The stock options were granted under the 1996
Stock Incentive Plan, 1998 Stock Option Plan, 1999 Stock Option Plan, 1999
Employee and Acquisition Related Stock Option Plan and 2000 Stock Option Plan at
the fair market value on the date of grant, except as described below. In the
first quarter of 1999, stock options were granted to employees and directors at
exercise prices of $13.20 and $16 per share which were below the fair market
value at the date of grant. In relation to these grants, Autobytel will
recognize estimated compensation expense of approximately $2.6 million ratably
over the vesting terms of one to four years. Compensation expense of $0.4
million and $1.1 million was classified as general and administrative expense in
2000 and 1999, respectively, and approximately $0.5 million, $0.5 million and
$40,000 will be classified as general and administrative expense in the years
ending 2001, 2002 and 2003, respectively.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

     Net cash used in operating activities was $3.6 million in the first quarter
of 2001 and $7.6 million in the first quarter of 2000. Net cash used in the
first quarter of 2001 resulted primarily from the year-to-date net loss,
increased accounts receivable and decreased accrued expenses due to a reduction
in Autobytel's sales and marketing and product and technology expenditures.
These uses of cash were partially offset by increased reserves for foreign
currency exchange losses related to foreign currency forward contracts,
depreciation and goodwill amortization and provision for bad debt.

     Net cash used in operating activities was $23.7 million in 2000, $14.5
million in 1999 and $16.3 million in 1998. Net cash used in 2000 resulted
primarily from the net loss for the year and increased accounts receivable
offset by increased accounts payable for sales and marketing, product and
technology development and general and administrative expenditures, provision
for bad debt and additional depreciation and goodwill amortization related to
the acquisition of A.I.N.

     Net cash used in operating activities in 1999 resulted primarily from the
net loss for the year, increased accounts receivable and prepaid expenses,
partially offset by increased deferred revenues related to growth in the number
of Autobytel's paying dealers, accounts payable and accrued expenses for sales
and marketing, product and technology development and general and administrative
expenditures, non-cash stock-based compensation expense related to options
granted in March 1999 and depreciation expense.

     Net cash used in operating activities in 1998 resulted primarily from the
net loss for the year and increased accounts receivable, partially offset by
depreciation and other non-cash expenses.

     Net cash used in investing activities was $2.5 million and $3.0 million for
the first quarter of 2001 and 2000, respectively. Cash used in investing
activities during the first quarter of 2001 was primarily related to capitalized
software development costs. Cash used in investing activities in the first
quarter of 2000 was primarily related to the acquisition of A.I.N.

     Net cash used in investing activities was $12.0 million in 2000, $0.9
million in 1999 and $1.1 million in 1998. Cash used in investing in 2000 was
related to the acquisition of A.I.N., expenditures for capitalized software,
investments in Autobytel's joint ventures in Spain, Sweden and France, notes
receivable from Autobytel's joint venture in France and the purchase of property
and equipment. Cash for investing activities in 1999 and 1998 was primarily used
for the purchase of property and equipment, including computer hardware,
telecommunications equipment and furniture.

     Net cash provided by financing activities was $2.0 million for the first
quarter of 2001, and $31.8 million for the first quarter of 2000. Cash provided
by financing activities in both the first quarter of 2001 and 2000 was primarily
due to funding received from strategic partners for investment in
Autobytel.Europe. In January 2000, Autobytel invested $5 million in
Autobytel.Europe which has been eliminated in consolidation.

     Net cash provided by financing activities was $32.3 million in 2000, $72.9
million in 1999 and $29.6 million in 1998. Cash provided by financing activities
in 2000 was primarily due to funding received from strategic investors for
investment in Autobytel.Europe. In January 2000, Autobytel invested $5 million
in Autobytel.Europe which has been eliminated in consolidation. Cash for
financing activities in 1999 and 1998 was primarily provided by the consummation
of Autobytel's initial public offering in March 1999 and the issuance of
preferred stock in 1998. Autobytel intends to use the remaining net proceeds
from its initial public offering for potential acquisitions, investments in
businesses and for general corporate purposes. Proceeds of $29.4 million from
the sale of preferred stock in 1998 were used primarily to finance operations
prior to the initial public offering.

     As of April 30, 2001, Autobytel had approximately $73.6 million in cash and
cash equivalents, of which $32.3 million represents funds of Autobytel.Europe
and is reserved for the operations of Autobytel.Europe. Autobytel believes its
current cash and cash equivalents are sufficient to meet its anticipated cash
needs for working capital and capital expenditures for at least the next 12
months.

     With respect to periods beyond April 30, 2002, Autobytel may be required to
raise additional capital to meet its long term operating requirements. Since
inception, Autobytel's expenses have exceeded its revenues. Autobytel does not
expect to be able to fund its operations from internally generated funds until
the second half of 2001 when it expects its revenues to exceed its expenses.
However, Autobytel cannot assure that its revenues will exceed its expenses
during such period or thereafter.

     Autobytel's cash requirements depend on several factors, including:

     - the level of expenditures on marketing and advertising,

     - the level of expenditures on product and technology development,

     - the ability to increase the volume of purchase requests and transactions
       related to Autobytel's Web sites,

     - the cost of contractual arrangements with Internet portals, online
       information providers, and other referral sources,

     - the level of investments in joint ventures and licensees, and

     - the cash portion of acquisition transactions.

     While management forecasts and budgets cash requirements, assumptions
underlying the estimates may change and could have a material impact on its cash
requirements. If capital requirements vary materially from those currently
planned, Autobytel may require additional financing sooner than anticipated.
Autobytel has no commitments for any additional financing, and there can be no
assurance that any such commitments can be obtained on favorable terms, if at
all.

     Any additional equity financing may be dilutive to Autobytel's
stockholders, and debt financing, if available, may involve restrictive
covenants with respect to dividends, raising capital and other financial and
operational matters which could restrict its operations or finances. If
Autobytel is unable to obtain additional financing as needed, it may be required
to reduce the scope of its operations or its anticipated expansion, which could
have a material adverse effect on its business, results of operations and
financial condition.

RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS

     In June 1998, the FASB issued SFAS No. 133, Accounting for Derivative
Instruments and Hedging Activities, which is effective for fiscal years
beginning after June 15, 2000 (as amended by SFAS No. 137 and 138). SFAS No. 133
establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments.
Autobytel adopted SFAS No. 133 in January 2001 and does not anticipate the
adoption to have a material effect on Autobytel's financial position or results
of operations.

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

     Autobytel.Europe, which operates in Europe, is a subsidiary of Autobytel.
Autobytel.Europe incurs general operating expenses and enters into transactions,
including investments in joint ventures and licensees, which require the use of
local foreign currencies. As a result of these transactions, Autobytel is
exposed to gains and losses resulting from changes in foreign currency exchange
rates. These fluctuations may adversely affect Autobytel's consolidated results
of operations and financial position. In certain circumstances, Autobytel.Europe
enters into foreign currency forward contracts in an effort to minimize the
risks and costs associated with these fluctuations. Neither Autobytel nor
Autobytel.Europe enters into foreign currency forward contracts or other
financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes.

     In July 2000, Autobytel.Europe entered into foreign currency forward
exchange contracts with maturity dates of September 26, 2000 and June 26, 2001.
These contracts obligate Autobytel.Europe to exchange U.S. dollars for
predetermined amounts of Netherlands guilders at specified exchange rates on
specified dates. Autobytel's consolidated statements of operations include
realized losses of $0.7 million and $0.7 million for the first quarter of 2001
and the year 2000, respectively, resulting from changes in the spot exchange
rate, including those from settled and open contracts.

     As of January 1, 2001, the notional value of the open foreign currency
forward contracts was matched by an equivalent amount of cash as recorded on
Autobytel's balance sheet. Therefore, in accordance with SFAS No. 133, these
open contracts are considered hedged contracts and are recorded at fair value on
Autobytel's balance sheet and the related gains or losses on these contracts are
deferred in stockholder's equity as a component of accumulated other
comprehensive income. As such, on an ongoing basis, Autobytel will not incur any
additional foreign currency financial exposure from potential volatility in
exchange rates on these foreign currency forward contracts.

     A sensitivity analysis indicates that for each 5% change in exchange rates
on foreign currencies utilized by Autobytel.Europe, Autobytel would incur no
additional losses on open foreign currency forward contracts and $0.2 million on
foreign currency cash balances at March 31, 2001.

STOCK OPTION GRANTS IN 2000

     The following table sets forth for each of the Autobytel Named Executive
Officers certain information concerning stock options granted to them during
2000. Autobytel has never issued stock appreciation rights. Autobytel grants
options at an exercise price equal to the fair market value of a share of common
stock as determined by its closing price on the Nasdaq National Market on the
date of grant. The term of each option granted is generally ten years from the
date of grant. Options may terminate before their expiration dates if the
optionee's status as an employee is terminated or upon the optionee's death or
disability.

EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENTS

     On July 1, 1998, Autobytel entered into a three year employment agreement
with Mr. Mark W. Lorimer, Autobytel's President and Chief Executive Officer.
This agreement automatically renews for one year periods unless either party
gives at least 30 days notice of an election not to renew and automatically
extends for three years from the date of a change of control. Under this
agreement, Mr. Lorimer is entitled to a base salary of $325,000 and a bonus as
determined by the board of directors from time to time. Under this agreement,
Mr. Lorimer also received options to purchase 200,000 shares which vest over two
years and a performance option to purchase 500,000 shares which vests on the
seventh anniversary of the grant date, unless accelerated upon the earlier
accomplishment of stock price goals. In addition, Mr. Lorimer may participate in
any medical, dental, welfare plans, insurance coverages and any death benefit
and disability benefit plans afforded to executive employees of Autobytel.

     If Mr. Lorimer's employment is terminated without "cause" or if Mr. Lorimer
terminates his employment with "good reason" (each as defined in his employment
agreement), Mr. Lorimer is entitled to a lump sum payment equal to the highest
annual base salary in effect during the term of the agreement multiplied by the
greater of (1) the remaining balance of the term or (2) two years.

     In addition to the above, in the event Mr. Lorimer's employment is
terminated during the six month period prior to (or the first thirty-six months
following) a change of control by Mr. Lorimer for good reason or by Autobytel
other than for cause, disability or death, Mr. Lorimer is entitled to a lump sum
payment equal to twice the highest bonus paid to Mr. Lorimer in the last three
fiscal years plus the amount of the cost of all benefits for the greater of the
remaining balance of the term or two years. In the event of a change of control
while Mr. Lorimer is employed by Autobytel or if Mr. Lorimer's employment is
terminated by Autobytel without cause or by Mr. Lorimer for good reason during
the six month period prior to a change of control, unvested time based options
shall become vested and exercisable and unvested performance-based options shall
become vested and exercisable to the extent performance targets have been met.
In the event of the death or disability of Mr. Lorimer during the term of his
employment agreement, Autobytel shall provide Mr. Lorimer or his successors,
heirs or designees, with continued payment of Mr. Lorimer's then current base
salary and all benefits for a period of two years. If Mr. Lorimer's severance
benefits are parachute payments under the Internal Revenue Code, Autobytel has
agreed to make additional payments to him to compensate for his additional tax
obligations.

     As of May 3, 2001, Autobytel entered into a three year employment agreement
with Mr. Benner, under which Mr. Benner is entitled to a base salary of $225,000
and a bonus as determined by the board of directors from time to time, but in no
event less than $100,000 per year. This agreement automatically renews for one
year periods unless either party gives at least 30 days notice of an election
not to renew. If Mr. Benner's employment is terminated without "cause" or if Mr.
Benner terminates his employment for "good reason" (each as defined in his
employment agreement), Mr. Benner is entitled to a lump sum payment equal to the
base salary that would have been received by Mr. Benner if he had remained
employed by Autobytel for the remaining balance of the term, but in no event
less than 12 months. Mr. Benner's employment with Autobytel shall terminate
automatically in the event of death or upon 30 days' written notice of
termination by Autobytel in the event of a disability.

     Under this agreement, Mr. Benner also received options to purchase 150,000
shares which vest over two years and a performance option to purchase 250,000
shares which vests on the fifth anniversary of the grant date, unless
accelerated upon the earlier accomplishment of stock price goals.

     In the event of a change of control of Autobytel between March 31, 2001 and
May 3, 2003, and while Mr. Benner remains employed by Autobytel, the term of the
agreement shall automatically extend for a period of two years from the date of
the change of control. In addition to the above, in the event Mr. Benner's
employment is terminated during the first twelve months following a change of
control by Mr. Benner for good reason or by Autobytel other than for cause,
disability or death, Mr. Benner is entitled to a lump sum payment equal to the
greater of (1) the base salary that would have been received by him for the
remainder of the term or (2) an amount equal to one year base salary plus an
amount equal to the highest annual bonus paid to him by Autobytel during the
term prior to termination. In

addition, Mr. Benner is entitled to the amount of the cost of employee insurance
benefits for one year. In the event of a change of control while Mr. Benner is
employed by Autobytel or if Mr. Benner's employment is terminated by Autobytel
without cause or by Mr. Benner for good reason during the six month period prior
to a change of control, unvested options shall become vested and exercisable. If
Mr. Benner's severance benefits are parachute payments under the Internal
Revenue Code, Autobytel has agreed to make additional payments to him to
compensate certain of his additional tax obligations. In addition, Mr. Benner
may participate in any medical, dental, welfare plans, insurance coverages and
any death benefit and disability benefit plans afforded to employees of
Autobytel.

     As of April 3, 2000, Autobytel entered into a two year employment agreement
with Mr. Amir, under which Mr. Amir is entitled to a base salary of $200,000
(which base salary was subsequently increased to $265,000) and a bonus as
determined by the board of directors from time to time. If Mr. Amir's employment
is terminated without "cause" or if Mr. Amir terminates his employment with
"good reason" (each as defined in his employment agreement), Mr. Amir is
entitled to a lump sum payment equal to the highest annual base salary in effect
during the term of the agreement for the remaining term of the agreement, but in
no event less than 12 months.

     In the event of a change of control of Autobytel between March 31, 2001 and
April 3, 2002, and while Mr. Amir remains employed by Autobytel, the term of the
agreement shall automatically extend for a period of one year from the date of
the change of control. In addition to the above, in the event Mr. Amir's
employment is terminated during the six month period prior to (or the first
twelve months following) a change of control by Mr. Amir for good reason or by
Autobytel other than for cause, disability or death, Mr. Amir is entitled to a
lump sum payment equal to twice the highest base salary paid during the term to
Mr. Amir plus the amount of the cost of employee insurance benefits for one
year. In the event of a change of control while Mr. Amir is employed by
Autobytel or if Mr. Amir's employment is terminated by Autobytel without cause
or by Mr. Amir for good reason during the six month period prior to a change of
control, unvested options shall become vested and exercisable. If Mr. Amir's
severance benefits are parachute payments under the Internal Revenue Code,
Autobytel has agreed to make additional payments to him to compensate certain of
his additional tax obligations. In addition, Mr. Amir may participate in any
medical, dental, welfare plans, insurance coverages and any death benefit and
disability benefit plans afforded to executive employees of Autobytel.

     On February 14, 2000, Autobytel entered into a three-year employment
agreement with Mr. Gorun, former President of Autobytel's subsidiary, A.I.N.
Corporation. Under this agreement, Mr. Gorun was entitled to a base salary of
$225,000, and a bonus in such amounts and based on such criteria as established
by the board of directors from time to time. Mr. Gorun was also granted options
to purchase 100,000 shares which vest fully by February 15, 2004. In addition,
Mr. Gorun was entitled to participate in any medical, dental, welfare plans,
insurance coverages and any death benefit and disability benefit plans afforded
to executive employees of Autobytel. Under the agreement, if Mr. Gorun's
employment is terminated without "cause" or if Mr. Gorun terminated his
employment for "good reason" (each as defined in his employment agreement), Mr.
Gorun was entitled to his base salary for an additional 180 days following such
termination. Mr. Gorun's employment with A.I.N. Corporation ceased in January
2001.

     Under a letter agreement dated June 15, 2000, Mr. McCarter's options vest
upon a change of control occurring while he is employed by Autobytel.

     Pursuant to the acquisition agreement, Autobytel has agreed to enter into a
three year employment agreement with Jeffrey Schwartz, Autoweb's President and
Chief Executive Officer. This agreement will become effective on the closing
date of the merger. This agreement automatically renews for one year periods
unless either party gives at least 30 days notice of an election not to renew.
Under this agreement, Mr. Schwartz has the position of Vice Chairman and is
entitled to a base salary of $275,000 and a bonus as determined by the board of
directors from time to time. Furthermore, Autobytel assumed 375,000 Autoweb
options held by Mr. Schwartz which shall all become vested as of the closing
date of the merger and shall be converted into Autobytel options pursuant to the
terms of the acquisition agreement.

Mr. Schwartz will also receive stock options to purchase 300,000 shares of
Autobytel's common stock which shall vest over three years and a performance
option to purchase 250,000 shares which shall vest on the seventh anniversary of
the grant date, unless accelerated upon the earlier accomplishment of stock
price goals.

     In addition, Mr. Schwartz may participate in any qualified or non-qualified
pension, profit sharing and savings plans, any death benefit and disability
benefit plans, life insurance coverages and any stock purchase programs afforded
to executive employees of Autobytel. If Mr. Schwartz' severance benefits are
parachute payments under the Internal Revenue Code, then Autobytel has agreed to
make additional payments to him to compensate for his additional tax
obligations. Mr. Schwartz' employment with Autobytel shall terminate
automatically in the event of death or upon 30 days written notice of
termination by Autobytel in the event of a disability.

     If Mr. Schwartz's employment is terminated without "cause" or if Mr.
Schwartz terminates his employment with "good reason" (each as defined in his
employment agreement), Mr. Schwartz is entitled to a lump sum payment equal to
the highest annual base salary of Mr. Schwartz in effect during the term of the
agreement. Furthermore, Autobytel shall continue to provide to Mr. Schwartz and
his beneficiaries, at its sole cost, any insurance coverages as described in the
preceding paragraph and shall pay to Mr. Schwartz in a lump sum payment the
aggregate cost of the benefits (other than the insurance coverages) as described
in the preceding paragraph, in each case to the extent that he would have
received such insurance coverages and benefits had he remained employed by
Autobytel for twelve months.

     In the event of a change of control of Autobytel prior to January 1, 2002,
and while Mr. Schwartz remains employed by Autobytel, the term of the agreement
shall automatically extend for a period of three years commencing from the date
of the change of control. In addition, in the event that Mr. Schwartz'
employment is terminated during the six month period prior to, or the first
twelve months following a change of control, by Mr. Schwartz for good reason or
by Autobytel other than for cause, disability or death, then the payments
described in the preceding paragraph do not apply and instead Mr. Schwartz is
entitled to a lump sum payment equal to twice the highest annual base salary in
effect during the term of the agreement plus Autobytel shall continue for one
year to provide to Mr. Schwartz and his beneficiaries, at its sole cost, any
insurance coverages. In the event of a change of control while Mr. Schwartz is
employed by Autobytel or if Mr. Schwartz's employment is terminated without
cause during the six month period prior to a change of control, unvested
time-based options shall become vested and exercisable and unvested
performance-based options shall become vested and exercisable to the extent
performance targets have been met.

NON-EMPLOYEE DIRECTOR COMPENSATION

     Autobytel's non-employee directors do not currently receive any cash
compensation for service on Autobytel's board of directors or any committee
thereof, but directors are reimbursed for expenses incurred in connection with
attendance at board and committee meetings.

     Autobytel's 1999 Stock Option Plan provides for an automatic grant of a
first option to purchase 20,000 shares of common stock to each non-employee
director on the date on which the person first becomes a non-employee director;
provided, that if any person serving as a non-employee director before January
14, 1999 received options for less than 20,000 shares on the date such person
became a member of the board of directors, such person was granted an option to
purchase a number of shares equal to the difference between 20,000 shares and
the shares actually granted. After the first option is granted to the
nonemployee director, he or she will automatically be granted a subsequent
option to purchase 5,000 shares on November 1 of each subsequent year provided
he or she is then a non-employee director and, provided further, that on such
date he or she has served on the board of directors for at least six months.
First options and each subsequent option will have a term of ten years. The
shares related to the first option and each subsequent option vest in their
entirety and becomes exercisable on the first anniversary of the grant date,
provided that the option holder continues to serve as a director on such dates.
The exercise price of shares subject to the first option and each subsequent
option shall be 100% of the fair market

value per share of common stock on the date of the grant of the option. The
Autobytel 2000 Stock Option Plan contains identical provision for option grants
to non-employee directors that become effective when no shares are available for
grant under the 1999 Stock Option Plan. In June 2000, each outside director was
granted options to purchase 25,000 shares which vested on the date of grant.

STOCK PLANS

     Since Autobytel's inception the board of directors has granted stock
options in order to attract, retain and motivate employees. Autobytel's board of
directors considers many factors in granting stock options. For example, among
other factors, Autobytel's board of directors considers competitive market
conditions for employees and the risk associated with working for an Internet
company.

     1996 Stock Option Plan. Autobytel's 1996 Stock Option Plan was approved by
the board of directors on May 18, 1996 and the stockholders on May 31, 1996. The
1996 Option Plan was terminated by a resolution of the board of directors on
October 23, 1996, at which time over 800,000 options had been issued. The 1996
Option Plan provided for the granting to employees and directors of stock
options intended to qualify as incentive stock options within the meaning of
Section 422 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and for the grant
to employees, consultants and directors of nonstatutory stock options. Autobytel
reserved 1,194,444 shares of common stock for issuance under the 1996 Option
Plan.

     Under the 1996 Option Plan, the exercise price of any incentive stock
options granted under the 1996 Option Plan were not less than the fair market
value of the common stock on the date of grant, and the exercise price of any
non-statutory stock option granted under the 1996 Option Plan were not less than
85% of the fair market value of the common stock at the date of grant. The term
of all options granted under the 1996 Option Plan did not exceed 10 years. The
administrator of the options granted under the 1996 Option Plan is the board of
directors or a committee of the board of directors. Any options granted under
the 1996 Option Plan are exercisable at such times as determined by the
administrator, but in no case at a rate of less than 20% per year over five
years from the grant date. A majority of the outstanding options vest and became
exercisable as to one third of the grant on October 31, 1996, and as to an
additional one third of the grant at each successive October 31. Options granted
under the 1996 Option Plan generally must be exercised within at least 30 days,
or such longer period as determined by the administrator, following termination
of the optionee's status as an employee, director or consultant of Autobytel, or
within 12 months following such optionee's termination by death or disability.

     The 1996 Option Plan provides that in the event of a merger of Autobytel
with or into another corporation, each option may be assumed or an equivalent
option substituted by the successor corporation. If the outstanding options are
not assumed or substituted as described in the preceding sentence, the option
will terminate as of the date of the closing of such a merger.

     1996 Stock Incentive Plan. The 1996 Stock Incentive Plan was approved by
the board of directors on October 23, 1996, amended and restated by the board of
directors on November 24, 1996 and approved by the stockholders on January 16,
1997. The 1996 Stock Incentive Plan provides for the granting to employees and
directors of stock options intended to qualify as incentive stock options within
the meaning of Section 422 of the Code, and for the granting to employees,
directors and consultants of nonstatutory stock options and stock purchase
rights.

     As approved by the stockholders, Autobytel reserved 833,333 shares of
common stock for issuance under the Incentive Plan. As of March 31, 2001,
options covering 111,739 shares of common stock were available for grant under
the Incentive Plan and are either incentive stock options or nonstatutory stock
options. Options granted under the Incentive Plan must generally be exercised
within three months of the end of the option holder's status as an employee or
consultant of Autobytel, or within twelve months after such option holder's
termination by death or disability, but in no event later than the expiration of
the option's ten year term.

     The board of directors determined the exercise price of nonstatutory stock
options granted under the Incentive Plan, and in all cases, the exercise price
was the fair market value of the common stock on the

date of grant. The term of all options granted under the Incentive Plan did not
exceed ten years. Stock options granted under the Incentive Plan vest according
to vesting schedules determined by the administrator.

     The Incentive Plan provides that in the event of a merger of Autobytel with
or into another corporation, a sale of substantially all of Autobytel's assets
or a like transaction involving Autobytel, each option will be assumed or an
equivalent option substituted by the successor corporation. If the outstanding
options are not assumed or substituted as described in the preceding sentence,
the committee of the board of directors shall provide for each option holder to
have the right to exercise the option as to all of the optioned stock, including
shares as to which the option would not otherwise be exercisable. If the
administrator makes an option exercisable in full in the event of a merger or
sale of assets, the administrator will notify the option holder that the option
will be fully exercisable for a period of 15 days from the date of such notice,
and the option will terminate upon the expiration of such period.

     From October 1996 through January 1999, Autobytel purported to grant
incentive stock options to employees, of which 689,406 shares granted exceeded
the Incentive Plan limit of 833,333 shares. As of January 29, 1999, 688,921
options, and 485 shares that were acquired upon the exercise of excess options
were outstanding in excess of the Incentive Plan limit. Because these grants
exceed the plan's limit, they did not qualify as incentive stock options, which
have more favorable tax treatment for employees than nonqualified stock options.
In connection with these matters, on January 29, 1999, Autobytel filed an
application with the California Department of Corporations for approval of a
rescission offer to those affected optionholders holding options covering
689,406 shares of common stock. The Department of Corporations approved the
rescission offer on February 12, 1999. The rescission offer allowed each
affected optionholder to choose between a cash payment or a new grant of
incentive stock options under the 1999 Stock Option Plan. The offer for a cash
payment was for 10% of the aggregate exercise price per share of the option plus
7% statutory interest since the date of grant of the option. The terms of the
options granted under the 1999 Stock Option Plan are similar to the terms of the
original stock options, with an exercise price equal to the fair market value on
the date of regrant. In addition, optionholders who chose new grants under the
1999 Stock Option Plan were granted additional options based on the length of
time the original options were held. The aggregate maximum number of additional
shares of common stock issuable under this choice for all those optionholders
were 35,000 shares. All the affected optionholders participated in the
rescission offer and Autobytel paid $8,000 to four optionholders who chose the
cash alternative.

     1996 Employee Stock Purchase Plan. Autobytel's 1996 Employee Stock Purchase
Plan was adopted by the board of directors on November 18, 1996 and approved by
the stockholders on January 16, 1997. The maximum number of shares of common
stock available for sale is 444,444. As of March 31, 2001, 391,826 shares of
common stock remain available for sale. The Purchase Plan, which is intended to
qualify under Section 423 of the Internal Revenue Code, permits eligible
employees of Autobytel to purchase shares of common stock through payroll
deductions of up to ten percent of their compensation for all purchase periods
ending within any calendar year.

     Individuals who are eligible employees on the start day of any offering
period may enter the Purchase Plan on that start date. Individuals who become
eligible employees after the start date of the offering period may join the
Purchase Plan on any subsequent quarterly entry date within that period.
Employees are eligible to participate if they are customarily employed by
Autobytel or any designated subsidiary for at least 20 hours per week and for
more than five months in any calendar year.

     The price of common stock purchased under the Purchase Plan will be 85% of
the lower of the fair market value of the common stock on the first or last day
of each six month purchase period. Employees may end their participation in the
Purchase Plan at any time during an offering period, and they will be paid their
payroll deductions to date. Participation ends automatically upon termination of
employment with Autobytel. Rights granted under the Purchase Plan are not
transferable by a participant other than by will, the laws of descent and
distribution, or as otherwise provided under the plan. The Purchase Plan is
administered by the board of directors or by a committee appointed by the board
of directors. The board

of directors may amend or modify the Purchase Plan at any time. The Purchase
Plan will terminate 10 years from the date of its adoption.

     1998 Stock Option Plan. Autobytel's 1998 Stock Option Plan was adopted by
the board of directors on December 17, 1998 and approved by the stockholders on
February 15, 1999. The Plan provides that an aggregate of 1,500,000 shares of
Autobytel common stock is available to be granted to key employees of Autobytel
and its parent or subsidiary corporations, if any. As of March 31, 2001, options
covering 211,575 shares of common stock were available for grant under the 1998
Option Plan. Under the 1998 Option Plan, eligible key employees of Autobytel may
receive incentive stock options within the meaning of Section 422 of the Code or
nonstatutory stock options. No eligible employee shall receive stock options
with respect to more than 700,000 shares of Autobytel's common stock during any
one calendar year.

     Incentive stock options granted under the 1998 Option Plan must have an
exercise price that is no less than the fair market value of Autobytel's common
stock as of the time the option is granted and generally may not be exercised
more than ten years after the date of grant. Any incentive stock option that is
granted to any option holder who beneficially owns more than 10% of the total
combined voting power of all classes of outstanding shares of capital stock of
Autobytel must have an exercise price that is no less than 110% of the fair
market value of Autobytel's common stock as of the time the option is granted
and may not be exercised more than five years after the date of grant. To the
extent that the aggregate fair market value of stock exercisable by an optionee
for the first time in any one calendar year under incentive stock options
granted under the 1998 Option Plan and all other stock plans of Autobytel
exceeds $100,000, options for such shares shall not be considered incentive
stock options but instead shall be considered nonstatutory stock options.

     Nonstatutory stock options granted under the 1998 Option Plan must have an
exercise price that is no less than 85% of the fair market value of Autobytel's
common stock as of the time the option is granted and may not be exercised more
than 10 years after the date they are granted. Under the 1998 Option Plan,
nonstatutory stock options vest over a time period determined by the
administrator, however, the vesting could accelerate based on the performance of
Autobytel's common stock. All other stock options granted under the 1998 Option
Plan vest according to time-based vesting schedules determined by the
administrator. In addition, an option holder who is not an officer, director or
consultant shall have the right to exercise at least 20% of the options granted
per year over 5 years from the date of grant. Options granted under the 1998
Option Plan are nontransferable, other than by will or the laws of descent and
distribution.

     The 1998 Option Plan provides that, unless otherwise stated in a stock
option agreement, upon any merger, consolidation, or sale or transfer of all or
any part of Autobytel's business or assets, any option shall vest and may be
exercised immediately unless any party to these transactions specifically
assumes Autobytel's obligations under the 1998 Option Plan. In addition, unless
otherwise provided in the stock option agreement for any given option, upon any
liquidation or dissolution of Autobytel, all rights of the option holder with
respect to the unexercised portion of any option will terminate and all options
will be canceled unless the plan under which such liquidation or dissolution is
effected makes specific provisions regarding the 1998 Option Plan. The holder of
any option granted under the 1998 Option Plan has the right immediately prior to
the effective date of a merger, consolidation or sale of Autobytel's business or
assets or a liquidation or dissolution to exercise such option without regard to
time restrictions applicable to exercise, but subject to any other conditions
precedent to exercise unless met or waived, and provided that any stock received
upon the exercise of unvested options continues to be subject to the applicable
vesting schedule. In no event may any incentive stock options be exercised later
than the date preceding the tenth anniversary date of the grant.

     The 1998 Option Plan will be administered by the board of directors or by a
committee of the board of directors acting as the administrator. The
administrator shall select the eligible key employees who are to be granted
options, determine the number of shares to be subject to options to be granted
to each eligible key employee and designate such options as incentive stock
options or nonstatutory stock options.

The board of directors may at any time amend or modify the 1998 Option Plan,
except that the board of directors may not, without approval of the stockholders
of Autobytel:

     - increase the number of shares issued under the 1998 Option Plan,

     - modify the requirements as to eligibility for participation in the 1998
       Option Plan or

     - change the option price provisions of the 1998 Option Plan so as to have
       a material adverse effect on Autobytel other than to conform with any
       applicable provisions of the Internal Revenue Code or regulations or
       rulings.

     Unless terminated earlier, the 1998 Option Plan terminates ten years from
the date it was adopted by the board of directors.

     1999 Stock Option Plan. Autobytel's 1999 Stock Option Plan was adopted by
the board of directors on January 14, 1999 and approved by the stockholders on
February 15, 1999. The plan provides that an aggregate of 1,800,000 shares of
Autobytel's common stock are available to its employees; provided that after
March 31, 1999, Autobytel may not grant more than 1,000,000 options under the
plan. As of March 31, 2001, options covering 474,640 shares of common stock were
available for grant under the 1999 Stock Option Plan. Unless otherwise provided
in the stock option agreement, upon any merger, consolidation, or sale or
transfer of all or any part of our business or assets, any option under the plan
shall immediately vest and be exercisable unless any party to such a transaction
specifically assumes the obligations of Autobytel under the 1999 Stock Option
Plan.

     Non-employee directors are entitled to participate in Autobytel's 1999
Stock Option Plan. The 1999 Stock Option Plan provides for an automatic grant of
a first option to purchase 20,000 shares of common stock to each non-employee
director on the date on which the person first becomes a non-employee director;
provided, that if any person serving as a non-employee director before January
14, 1999 received options for less than 20,000 shares on the date such person
became a member of the board of directors, such person will be granted an option
to purchase a number of shares equal to the difference between 20,000 shares and
the shares actually granted. After the first option is granted to the
non-employee director, he or she will automatically be granted a subsequent
option to purchase 5,000 shares on November 1 of each subsequent year provided
he or she is then a non-employee director and, provided further, that on such
date he or she has served on the board of directors for at least six months.
First options and each subsequent option will have a term of ten years. The
shares related to the first option and each subsequent option vest in their
entirety and becomes exercisable on the first anniversary of the grant date,
provided that the option holder continues to serve as a director on such dates.
The exercise price of shares subject to the first option and each subsequent
option shall be 100% of the fair market value per share of the common stock on
the date of the grant of the option. The 1999 Stock Option Plan is identical in
all other material respects to the 1998 Stock Option Plan.

     1999 Employee and Acquisition Related Stock Option Plan. Autobytel's 1999
Employee and Acquisition Related Stock Option Plan was adopted by the board of
directors on September 22, 1999. The plan provides that an aggregate of 1.5
million shares of Autobytel's common stock are available to employees and
service providers of Autobytel, its subsidiaries or any entity in which
Autobytel or its subsidiaries acquires at least a 50% equity interest. As of
March 31, 2001, options covering 462,225 shares of common stock were available
for grant under the 1999 Employee and Acquisition Related Stock Option Plan. No
eligible employee or service provider may receive stock options with respect to
more than 700,000 shares of Autobytel's common stock during any one calendar
year. Unless otherwise provided in the stock option agreement, upon any merger,
consolidation, or sale or transfer of all or any part of Autobytel's business or
assets, any option under the plan will immediately vest and be exercisable
unless any party to such a transaction specifically assumes the obligations of
Autobytel under the 1999 Employee and Acquisition Plan. The vesting of
non-statutory stock options issued under this plan cannot be accelerated by
reason of the performance of Autobytel's common stock. The 1999 Employee and
Acquisition Option Plan is identical in all other material respects to the 1998
Stock Option Plan, except that any compensation paid under Autobytel's 1999
Employee and Acquisition Related Stock Option Plan

will not be performance based compensation for purposes of Section 162(m) of the
Internal Revenue Code.

     2000 Stock Option Plan. Autobytel's 2000 Stock Option Plan was adopted by
the board of directors on April 12, 2000 and approved by the stockholders on
June 15, 2000. The plan provides that an aggregate of 3,000,000 shares of
Autobytel's common stock are available to Autobytel's employees and service
providers. As of March 31, 2001, options covering 922,239 shares of common stock
were available for grant under the 2000 Stock Option Plan. Unless otherwise
provided in the stock option agreement, upon any merger, consolidation, or sale
or transfer of all or any part of Autobytel's business or assets, any option
under the plan shall immediately vest and be exercisable unless any party to
such a transaction specifically assumes the obligations of Autobytel under the
2000 Stock Option Plan.

     Non-employee directors are entitled to participate in Autobytel's 2000
Stock Option Plan. The 2000 Stock Option Plan provides for an automatic grant of
a first option to purchase 20,000 shares of common stock to each non-employee
director elected after January 1, 2000, on the date on which the person first
becomes a non-employee director. After the first option is granted to the
non-employee director, he or she will automatically be granted a subsequent
option to purchase 5,000 shares on November 1 of each subsequent year provided
he or she is then a non-employee director and, provided further, that on such
date he or she has served on the board of directors for at least six months.
First options and each subsequent option will have a term of ten years. The
shares related to the first option and each subsequent option vest in their
entirety and becomes exercisable on the first anniversary of the grant date,
provided that the option holder continues to serve as a director on such dates.
The exercise price of shares subject to the first option and each subsequent
option shall be 100% of the fair market value per share of the common stock on
the date of the grant of the option. The 2000 Stock Option Plan is identical in
all other material respects to the 1998 Stock Option Plan.

     401(k) Plan. All employees of Autobytel who are at least age 21 and have
completed three months of service with Autobytel are eligible to participate in
the Autobytel Retirement Savings Plan, a defined contribution plan that was
effective September 1, 1997, and intended to qualify under Section 401(a) of the
Internal Revenue Code. Eligible employees may enter the savings plan as of the
first day of January, April, July or October following the date on which they
have met the savings plan's eligibility requirements. Participants may make
pre-tax contributions to the savings plan of up to 15% of their eligible
earnings, but not in excess of a statutory annual limit.

     Autobytel may make discretionary matching contributions to the savings
plan. In 2000, Autobytel began to match contributions with Autobytel common
stock purchased directly from Autobytel or in the open market. The maximum
matching contribution per employee is $3,000 per year. Each participant in the
savings plan is fully vested in his or her contributions and the investment
earnings on these contributions. Participants become 100% vested in matching
contributions made on their behalf, and the investment earnings on these
contributions, after two service years. Contributions by the participants or
Autobytel and the income earned on such contributions are not taxable to the
participants until withdrawn. Contributions by Autobytel, if any, are deductible
by it when made. Contributions are held in trust as required by law.

     Individual participants may direct the trustee to invest their accounts in
authorized investment alternatives. All contributions are deposited to a
tax-exempt trust and credited to individual participant accounts, which are
invested as directed by participants in a number of available investment funds,
including Autobytel's common stock. Participants may also vote shares of
Autobytel's common stock allocated to their accounts. Plan accounts are
distributed when a participant retires (at age 65 or later), dies, becomes
permanently disabled, or leaves Autobytel for any other reason. Participants may
borrow from their accounts, or make withdrawals to meet financial hardships,
while they are Autobytel employees. Autobytel has the right to amend or
terminate the savings plan at any time, but is prohibited from recovering any of
the savings plan's assets.

COMPENSATION COMMITTEE INTERLOCKS AND INSIDER PARTICIPATION

     No interlocking relationship exists between the board of directors or
compensation committee and the board of directors or compensation committee of
any other company, nor has any such interlocking relationship existed in the
past. The compensation committee of the board of directors currently consists of
Mr. Fuchs, Mr. Coats and Mr. Orton.

* $100 INVESTED ON 3/26/99 IN STOCK OR INDEX -- INCLUDING REINVESTMENT OF
  DIVIDENDS.

SECTION 16(a) BENEFICIAL OWNERSHIP REPORTING COMPLIANCE

     Based upon Autobytel's review of forms filed by directors, officers and
certain beneficial owners of Autobytel's common stock (the "Section 16 Reporting
Persons") pursuant to Section 16 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as
amended, Autobytel has identified the following filings that were filed late by
the Section 16 Reporting Persons during fiscal 2000: Michael Gorun did not file
one Form 4 with respect to at least one transaction. Autobytel is not aware of
any other failures by the Section 16 Reporting Persons to file the forms
required to be filed by them pursuant to Section 16 of the Exchange Act.

CERTAIN RELATIONSHIPS AND RELATED TRANSACTIONS

     Consulting Agreement. Autobytel and Robert Grimes, a current director and a
former Executive Vice President of Autobytel, are parties to a two year
consulting services agreement dated April 1, 2000. During the term of the
consulting agreement, Mr. Grimes is entitled to receive $50,000 per year payable
on a monthly basis and a $2,500 monthly office expense allowance. Mr. Grimes
will make himself available to the executive officers of Autobytel for up to 16
hours a month for consultation and other activities related to formulating and
implementing business strategies and relationships. Autobytel may terminate the
agreement upon Mr. Grimes' breach of contract. If Mr. Grimes' agreement is
terminated without breach, Mr. Grimes is entitled to either a pro rated or a
lump sum payment equal to the consulting salary that would have been received by
Mr. Grimes if he had remained a consultant for the remaining balance of the two
year term. In the event of death or disability, Autobytel will pay to Mr. Grimes
or his successors and assigns the amount that Mr. Grimes would have received for
the remainder of the term of the agreement. Mr. Grimes has the right to
terminate the agreement upon 90 days notice to Autobytel. During the term of the
agreement, Mr. Grimes will be entitled to participate in all of Autobytel's
employee welfare benefit plans at Autobytel's expense.

     Loans. From time to time, Autobytel has advanced funds to Peter Ellis, the
former chairman of the board of directors and former chief executive officer of
Autobytel. As of December 31, 1999, Mr. Ellis was indebted to Autobytel in the
amount of $250,000 plus accrued interest at the rate of 8% per year compounded
quarterly, with principal and accrued interest due and payable on or before
March 1, 2003. Autobytel received a pledge of 100,657 of Mr. Ellis' shares of
common stock to secure this loan. Mr. Ellis repaid the loan, including accrued
interest, in January 2000.

     Voting Proxy. On January 11, 1999, in consideration of Autobytel waiving
its right of first refusal permitting the sale of $1.4 million of common stock
(at $11.88 per share) by Mr. Ellis to "accredited investors" as such term is
defined under Rule 501 of the Securities Act of 1933, Mr. Ellis transferred to
Autobytel the voting power of 593,175 shares of common stock owned by Mr. Ellis
for a period that is the earlier of three years from such date or until such
time as Mr. Ellis sells the shares to a person not affiliated with Mr. Ellis.
The Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Operating Officer, if any, of
Autobytel have the right to vote all of the proxy shares as they deem
appropriate or desirable.

       AUTOBYTEL COMPENSATION COMMITTEE REPORT ON EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION

     This report on executive compensation is required by the Securities and
Exchange Commission and shall not be deemed to be incorporated by reference by
any general statement incorporating by reference this joint proxy
statement/prospectus into any filing under the Securities Act, or under the
Exchange Act, except to the extent that Autobytel specifically incorporates this
information by reference, and shall not otherwise be deemed soliciting material
or filed under such Acts.

     The compensation committee of the board of directors administers
Autobytel's executive compensation program. The current members of the
compensation committee are Mr. Fuchs, Mr. Coats and Mr. Orton. Each of these
persons is a non-employee director within the meaning of Section 16 of the
Securities Act of 1933, and an "outside director" within the meaning of Section
162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code.

GENERAL COMPENSATION PHILOSOPHY

     The role of the compensation committee is to set the salaries and other
compensation of the executive officers and certain other key employees of
Autobytel, and to make grants under, and to administer, the stock option and
other employee purchase and bonus plans. Autobytel's compensation philosophy for
executive officers is to relate compensation to corporate performance and
increases in stockholder value, while providing a total compensation package
that is competitive and enables Autobytel to attract, motivate, reward and
retain key executives and employees. Accordingly, each executive officer's
compensation package may, in one or more years, be comprised of the following
three elements:

     - base salary that is designed primarily to be competitive with base salary
       levels in effect at high technology companies in California that are of
       comparable size to Autobytel and with which Autobytel competes for
       executive personnel;

     - annual variable performance awards, such as bonuses, payable in cash and
       tied to the achievement of performance goals, financial or otherwise,
       established by the compensation committee; and

     - long-term stock-based incentive awards which strengthen the mutuality of
       interests between the executive officers and Autobytel.com's
       stockholders.

EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION

     Base Salary. Salaries for executive officers for 2000 were generally
determined on an individual basis by evaluating each executive's scope of
responsibility, performance, prior experience and salary history, as well as the
salaries for similar positions at comparable companies.

     Annual Incentive Awards. The compensation committee evaluated the
performance of Autobytel relative to the performance of other similarly situated
companies. To the extent that bonuses were paid to officers in 2000, the
compensation committee considered several factors including:

     - the position held by the executive to whom the bonus was paid;

     - total compensation paid by comparable companies to similarly situated
       executives;

     - the performance of the executive;

     - the development of Autobytel's operations as measured by its growth in
       revenues, the decline of the ratio of expenses to revenues and the level
       of its loss per share; and

     - the perceived increase in the value of Autobytel's business in light of
       factors, including market capitalization, third party investments and
       commercial transactions, and relative market position against
       competitors.

     The compensation committee from time to time considers various
discretionary incentive compensation alternatives for Autobytel's executives.

     Long-Term Incentive Awards. The compensation committee believes that
equity-based compensation in the form of stock options links the interests of
executive officers with the long-term interests of Autobytel's stockholders and
encourages executive officers to remain in Autobytel's employ. Stock options
generally have value for executive officers only if the price of Autobytel's
shares of common stock increases above the fair market value of a share of
common stock on the grant date and the officer remains in Autobytel's employ for
the period required for the shares granted to such person to vest.

     In 2000, Autobytel granted stock options in accordance with the 1996 Stock
Incentive Plan, 1998 Stock Option Plan, 1999 Stock Option Plan, 1999 Employee
and Acquisition Related Stock Option Plan and 2000 Stock Option Plan. During
2000, stock options were granted to certain executive officers as incentives for
them to become employees or to aid in the retention of executive officers and to
align their interests with those of the stockholders. Stock options typically
have been granted to executive officers when the executive first joins
Autobytel. At the discretion of the compensation committee, executive officers
may also be granted stock options to provide greater incentives to continue
their employment with Autobytel and to strive to increase the value of
Autobytel's common stock. The number of shares subject to each stock option
granted is within the discretion of the compensation committee and is based on
anticipated future contribution and ability to impact Autobytel's results, past
performance or consistency within the officer's peer group. In 2000, the
compensation committee considered these factors. The stock options granted in
2000 generally become exercisable over a three-year period and are granted at a
price that is equal to the fair market value of Autobytel's common stock on the
date of grant.

CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER COMPENSATION

     Mr. Lorimer's base salary, target bonus, bonus paid and long-term incentive
awards for 2000 were determined by the compensation committee in a manner
consistent with the factors described above for all executive officers.

INTERNAL REVENUE CODE SECTION 162(M) LIMITATION

     The compensation committee has considered the potential impact of Section
162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code on the compensation paid to Autobytel's
executive officers. Section 162(m) disallows a tax deduction for the
compensation paid to certain executives of publicly-held corporations in excess
of $1.0 million in any taxable year. The $1.0 million limitation applies per
executive per year and only to the compensation paid to the chief executive
officer and the four highest compensated executive officers, and provided such
compensation is not performance-based. In general, it is the compensation
committee's policy to qualify its executives' compensation for deductibility
under applicable tax laws, although from time to time the compensation committee
will consider and award compensation not so qualified under appropriate
circumstances.

                        AUTOBYTEL AUDIT COMMITTEE REPORT

     The following Audit Committee Report is provided in accordance with the
rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission. Pursuant to
such rules and regulations, this report shall not be deemed "soliciting
materials," filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, subject to
Regulation 14A or 14C of the Securities and Exchange Commission or subject to
the liabilities of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as
amended, nor shall this Audit Committee Report be deemed to be incorporated by
reference by any general statement incorporating by reference this joint proxy
statement/prospectus into any filing under the Securities Act or the Exchange
Act, except to the extent that Autobytel specifically incorporates this
information by reference.

     The audit committee oversees Autobytel's financial reporting process on
behalf of its board of directors. Management has the primary responsibility for
the financial statements, the reporting process and the systems of internal
controls. In fulfilling its oversight responsibilities, the committee reviewed
the audited financial statements in the annual report with management. As part
of its review, the committee discussed the quality, and not just the
acceptability, of the accounting principles, the reasonableness of significant
judgments, and the clarity of disclosures in the financial statements.

     The committee reviewed with the independent auditors, who are responsible
for expressing an opinion on the conformity of those audited financial
statements with generally accepted accounting principles, their judgments as to
the quality, not just the acceptability, of Autobytel's accounting principles
and such other matters as are required to be discussed with the committee under
generally accepted accounting principles. In addition, the committee has
discussed with the independent auditors the auditors' independence from
management and Autobytel including the matters in the written disclosures
required by the Independence Standards Board and considered the compatibility of
non-audit services with the auditors' independence.

     The committee discussed with the independent auditors the overall scope and
plans for their audits. The committee meets with the independent auditors to
discuss the results of their examinations, their evaluations of Autobytel's
internal controls, and the overall quality of its financial reporting.

     In reliance on the reviews and discussions referred to above, the committee
recommended to the board of directors (and the board of directors approved) that
the audited financial statements be included in the Annual Report on Form 10-K
for the year ended December 31, 2000 for filing with the Securities and Exchange
Commission.

                                AUTOWEB BUSINESS

OVERVIEW

     Autoweb is a leading consumer automotive Internet service. Autoweb's Web
site centralizes an extensive collection of automotive-related commerce, content
and community offerings to assist consumers in researching, evaluating and
buying vehicles and automotive-related products and services such as insurance
and financing. In addition, Autoweb provides automotive content, Web hosting and
development services and sales automation services to vehicle manufacturers,
dealers and online partners. Autoweb was incorporated in California on October
3, 1995 as Downtown Web, Inc. and reincorporated in Delaware on March 16, 1999
as Autoweb.com, Inc. Its principal executive offices are located at 3270 Jay
Street, Santa Clara, California 95054, and its telephone number is (408)
970-9100.

     Autoweb began selling its services to automobile dealers and launched the
Autoweb Web site for consumer use in October 1995. Currently its network of
member dealers (where each franchise and pre-owned location for a particular
vehicle manufacturer is defined as a member dealer) is approximately 4,400.

     The Autoweb Web site and purchase process are designed to provide consumers
with dedicated customer care, choice and the means to execute their buying
decisions through a process that it believes is faster, better and easier than
traditional alternatives. During 2000, Autoweb delivered approximately 1.6
million vehicle inquiries to member dealers and 1.5 million purchase inquiries
to automotive-related vendors or category partners. Autoweb believes it has a
scalable business model characterized by diverse revenue sources and synergy
with online category, infrastructure and advertising partnerships.

     Through its acquisition of Automotive Information Center, or AIC, in 1999,
Autoweb also provides consumers and automotive professionals with Autosite.com,
a 20,000-page online vehicle buyer's guide and a rich suite of related services
information and original automotive editorial content.

BENEFITS TO CONSUMERS

     Convenient Purchase Process. The Autoweb purchase process provides an
environment that allows consumers to research, compare and select new or
pre-owned vehicles conveniently in the privacy of their home or office. From the
Web site, a consumer can submit a purchase inquiry to up to two member dealers
in a geographic area. The consumer is contacted by a member dealer, usually
within 24 hours of submitting their request and given information on the vehicle
of their choice and up-front pricing over the phone or via e-mail.

     Informed Purchase Decision. Consumers obtain online access to a wide range
of comprehensive, objective, up-to-date information about vehicle models,
options and dealer costs at no charge. Information such as vehicle
specifications and other information provided by AIC's comprehensive database,
Kelley Blue Book pre-owned vehicle values and reviews from Autoweb's
Professional Review are available in a centralized location. Autoweb's tools aid
consumers in finding a vehicle by offering the ability to search for a vehicle
by features (i.e., price, category, safety features, interior features).
Consumers can look at a variety of photographs of each vehicle and do a side by
side comparison of look, specifications and vehicle options. Additionally, at
Autosite.com, consumers have access to a 20,000-page online vehicle buyer's
guide, services and information.

     Availability of Automotive-Related Products and Services. Autoweb's Web
site offers consumers convenient access to a wide range of automotive-related
products and services, such as financing, insurance and maintenance, before and
after the purchase of a vehicle.

BENEFITS TO MEMBER DEALERS

     Efficient Marketing and Sales Process. By joining Autoweb's member dealer
network, member dealers gain access to a large number of purchase-minded
consumers who have, in many instances, already chosen the vehicle they wish to
purchase. As a result, member dealers can complete the sales process

more quickly and efficiently, potentially enabling them over time to reduce
their labor and overhead costs. Also, through its SalesEnhancer tool, Autoweb
provides sales automation tools to help member dealers (and non-member dealers)
manage sales, especially those sales related to their Internet marketing
efforts.

     Flexible Automotive eSolutions. Autoweb has designed a flexible package of
services that assists dealerships in targeting on-line customers, improving
management of their online sales department and improving their on-line buying
service effectiveness. Dealers can choose from two different pricing models to
fit their needs. Under the "pay-for-performance" program, dealers pay only when
Autoweb provides a qualified purchase inquiry to them. In addition, the program
permits member dealers to customize the geographic radius from which they
receive purchase inquiries based on their evaluation of which purchase inquiries
will be most likely to result in vehicle sales. Under the "flat fee" program,
dealers set a customized geographic radius from which they receive a number of
purchase inquiries and pay a flat rate for a 90 day period. The flat rate is
based on a number of leads to be received per month.

     Purchase Inquiry Verification. Autoweb verifies and appends additional
useful information to over two thirds of the purchase inquiries processed
through its Web site. It filters out unsubstantiated purchase inquiries prior to
sending them on to its member dealers. This saves the dealer partners valuable
time and resources in tracking down dead-end leads or bad information.

BENEFITS TO OTHERS

     Vehicle Manufacturers. Autoweb provides vehicle manufacturers with access
to a large number of purchase-minded consumers from an attractive demographic
base. Using the targeted nature of Internet advertising, manufacturers can
advertise their brand image effectively to specific subsets of Autoweb
consumers. Vehicle manufacturers can deliver advertisements to consumers who are
researching vehicles of direct competitors, thereby increasing the likelihood of
influencing their purchase decisions. Furthermore, vehicle manufacturers can
sponsor packaged Autoweb services provided to member dealers to improve sales of
given vehicle makes and models. In addition, AIC provides automotive
manufacturers with the data, tools and services used for internal planning,
competitive analysis and development and for re-publication on their Web sites.

     Category Partners. Autoweb provides category partners with access to a
large number of purchase-minded consumers in the process of researching vehicles
and automotive-related products and services. Consumers seeking to purchase a
vehicle may wish to buy direct or may also require insurance, financing, car
accessories or related services from one of its online category partners.
Consumers seeking automotive information are also often interested in or
specifically researching competitive providers for their current
automotive-related services. Category partners can advertise to these consumers
or integrate their product with the Web site.

     Portals and Publishers. Integrating content and decision tools with diverse
commerce choices and lifecycle offerings, Autoweb provides partners with co- and
ingredient-branded automotive Web modules and turnkey destinations. AIC data and
comparison tools are the basis for online new car buying sites, media sites and
search engine buying services, providing these partners with high quality data
and service cost efficiencies.

STRATEGY

     Autoweb's objective is to be a leading consumer automotive Internet
service. Its strategy is to leverage the consumer focus, traffic volume,
information expertise (automotive data, content and tools) and collaborative
partnerships with dealers, vehicle manufacturers, portals and category partners
to create a robust, dynamic automotive site.

CONSUMER FOCUS

     Optimize Consumer Experience. Autoweb provides the consumer with the data
and tools to research, compare and locate the car of their choice from a central
Web location.

TRAFFIC VOLUME

     Increase Consumer Traffic. As part of its efforts to increase consumer
traffic, it continues to focus its online advertising on a variety of high
traffic Web sites. The Autoweb Affiliates program launched in the second quarter
of 1998, had approximately 3,000 Web sites participating in the program in 2000.
Under this program, affiliated Web sites are paid a fee to provide it with
additional traffic to its purchase request process. Autoweb also has
revenue-sharing arrangements with companies such as America Online, iWon.com,
Homestore.com and Lycos relating to purchase inquiries submitted by consumers
through links between its Web site and the other company's Web sites. It intends
to expand its revenue-sharing and affiliate programs with other selected Web
sites in an effort to drive additional consumer traffic to its site.

INFORMATION EXPERTISE

     Enhance and Broaden Content Offerings. Autoweb provides high quality
content which facilitates consumer buying decisions related to and including the
purchase of a vehicle. Autoweb works with leading automotive content providers
to provide consumers with expert advice and information on its Web site. Autoweb
has strong relationships with the majority of vehicle manufacturers, such as
General Motors and Ford, including data licensing and on-going Web-based project
using development of the AIC competitive comparison product database.
Furthermore, AIC currently has commercial relationships to support its data
licensing efforts with Yahoo!, Excite, and Lycos. Autoweb intends to broaden the
resources and services available to consumers by developing relationships with
other leading automotive content providers.

     Increase Brand Awareness. Autoweb brand awareness is critical to it being a
leading consumer automotive Internet service. Its consumer branding efforts are
primarily focused on online advertising and infrastructure partnerships with
quality high traffic Web sites. Autoweb currently has long-term marketing
arrangements with America Online and Lycos and shorter term advertising
relationships with others. It ended a long-term marketing relationship with
Yahoo!, but continues to advertise on their Web site. Autoweb's strategy is to
increase its brand awareness further through continued online advertising, co-
and ingredient-branded infrastructure partnerships, traditional media
advertising and automotive industry focused media, ongoing public relations
efforts and expanded affiliate arrangements.

     Expand and Enhance Member Dealer Network. Autoweb believes that enhancing
the quality and franchise distribution of its member dealer network is critical
to its success. Autoweb's objective is to have at least one member dealer
representing each vehicle manufacturer make within a reasonable driving distance
of every consumer in the United States, with most consumers given a choice of
several dealers within a given area.

SALES

     Sales to Dealers. Autoweb believes that the quality and franchise
distribution of its member dealer network is critical to its success. The sales
force seeks to ensure that its member dealer network provides coverage such that
consumers are always within a reasonable driving distance of at least one member
dealer. The regional specialists analyze purchase inquiries from areas not
currently covered by its member dealer network and target dealers within these
areas to join its program. Dealers are chosen based on their ability to meet
this unsatisfied demand and their agreement to adhere to the Autoweb purchase
process. Regional account managers are compensated based on building successful,
long-term dealer relationships. The same sales force is responsible for both the
new and pre-owned vehicle programs, since its pre-owned vehicle program is also
primarily targeted to franchised dealers, as opposed to independent dealers.

     Sales to Vehicle Manufacturers and Category Partners. The Autoweb business
development group is responsible for expanding Autoweb's commerce services in
the vehicle and automotive-related markets. Category partners are selected based
on their ability to provide relevant, quality services online that enhance
Autoweb's value to consumers. Business development is focused on expanding
existing service categories and adding new consumer categories. Additionally,
AIC has a business development group focused on Autosite.com online commerce
partnerships and a sales group focused on vehicle manufacturer products and
services.

     Sales to Advertisers. Autoweb's advertising sales effort is primarily
targeted to vehicle manufacturers and automotive-related mass market consumer
vendors. Campaign specifications are typically negotiated with the advertising
agency or directly with the manufacturer or automotive-related vendor.

MARKETING

     Autoweb's marketing strategy includes the following key points:

     Build the Brand. To date, it has focused primarily on online promotions and
print media. In addition, its regular advertising in the leading automotive
trade publications has helped to build dealer brand awareness.

     Spend Efficiently on Advertising. Broad consumer interest in the automotive
category allows Autoweb to use a versatile advertising strategy. As a result, it
has been able to build its brand effectively through the efficient use of online
advertising and consumer promotional events including high profile, high traffic
Web sites such as America Online (and related properties), Yahoo! and Lycos.

     Increase Revenue Per Visitor. To increase revenue per visitor, Autoweb must
enhance and expand the content and increase the services available on its Web
site. It continues to expand its research content and tools and to add products
and services to aid consumers throughout the car ownership cycle.

     Develop Strategic Relationships. In addition to Autoweb's advertisements,
it has created revenue-sharing relationships with brand leaders such as America
Online, iWon.com and Lycos. It intends to continue to develop strategic
relationships that will provide not only brand exposure but also valuable
content for its Web site.

     Expand the Autoweb.com Affiliates Program.   The Autoweb affiliates program
allows other Web sites to link with the Autoweb Web site. The affiliates receive
a commission for traffic and consumers delivered

to the Autoweb site. This program generates brand awareness and revenue for a
lower relative cost. Autoweb intends to expand this program in the future.

TECHNOLOGY

     Autoweb believes that it has built a robust, scalable user interface, a
content delivery and transaction processing system that is designed around
industry standard architectures and internally-developed proprietary software.
The system records and collects operational data records regarding franchised
dealers, billing information, pre-owned vehicle listings and new and pre-owned
vehicle purchase inquiries. The system also handles other aspects of the new and
pre-owned vehicle buying process, including submitting XML, e-mail and facsimile
copies of consumer purchase inquiries to member dealers and submitting insurance
and finance inquiries, as well as other inquiries to its category partners.

     Autoweb has an online system available for member dealers, advertisers and
category partners to access relevant information. For example, member dealers
can access an Autoweb Web site to manage their pre-owned car inventory by
adding, modifying or updating their listings, as well as uploading pictures of
pre-owned cars. Member dealers can view their customer information and generate
reports based on their customers' survey responses. Autoweb affiliates can also
use the extranet to view activity summaries of their account.

     Autoweb service provides 24 hour a day, seven day a week availability,
subject to occasional short maintenance periods and power outages. The State of
California is suffering an energy crisis and has periodically implemented
rolling black outs throughout the state. It is anticipated that the energy
crisis will continue into the near future resulting in continued shortages of
electricity and power outages. Autoweb's system hardware is hosted and located
at Exodus Communications, Inc. in Santa Clara, California. Exodus provides for
an independent back up power source in order to prevent a break in service to
the Internet. However, recently, Exodus suffered a power disruption that caused
its backup system to fail. This outage did not have a material adverse effect on
Autoweb. The network is protected by a firewall from Checkpoint. Autoweb has
engineered redundancy into its systems. Both firewalls and load balances are set
up with "hot fail" switchover, minimizing service impact if systems fail. The
system consists of Dell database servers running Microsoft SQL and several
Pentium-based Microsoft Internet servers running on Windows NT operating
systems. Autoweb uses Allaire Cold Fusion for most of its Web application
development and delivery.

COMPETITION

     The market for the purchase of vehicles and automotive-related products and
services is intensely competitive, and Autoweb expects competition to increase
significantly, particularly on the Internet. Barriers to entry on the Internet
are relatively low, and it faces competitive pressures from numerous companies.
Currently, it believes its most significant competitor is MSN CarPoint. There
are also a number of Web sites that offer vehicles, particularly vehicle
manufacturers' own Web sites and sites for electronic classified ads.
Additionally, there are numerous Web sites that offer vehicle information and
other content, as well as community offerings, directly to the vehicle buying
consumer or targeted audiences such as car collectors. It also faces competition
from large dealer groups and traditional media companies, such as newspaper,
television and radio companies, many of which currently operate a Web site. In
addition to direct competitors, Autoweb also competes indirectly with vehicle
brokerage firms, discount warehouse clubs and automobile clubs. Several auction
Web sites auction vehicles on the Internet. Autoweb also competes with a variety
of automotive data, vehicle manufacturer and dealer services companies.

     Autoweb believes that the principal competitive factors in attracting
consumers to its Web site are:

     - a positive vehicle purchasing experience for the consumer;

     - brand awareness and loyalty;

     - breadth of selections;

     - ease of use;

     - adequate geographic coverage of member dealers;

     - Web site functionality, responsiveness and information; and

     - quality of content, service offerings and customer service.

     Autoweb believes that the principal competitive factors in attracting
member dealers, category partners and advertisers include:

     - the volume of its Web site traffic;

     - its brand awareness and loyalty;

     - the demographics of its consumers;

     - the cost effectiveness of purchase inquiries it delivers; and

     - the cost effectiveness of advertising on its Web site.

     Many of its existing and potential competitors have longer operating
histories in the Internet market, greater name recognition, larger consumer
bases and significantly greater financial, technical and marketing resources
than it does. These competitors may be able to undertake more extensive
marketing campaigns for their brand, products and services, adopt more
aggressive pricing policies and make more attractive offers to potential
employees. Furthermore, Autoweb's existing and potential competitors may develop
offerings that equal or exceed the quality of its offerings, or achieve greater
market acceptance, than Autoweb. It cannot assure you that it will be able to
compete successfully against its current or future competitors or that
competition will not have a material adverse effect on its business, results of
operations and financial condition.

PROPRIETARY RIGHTS

     Autoweb regards its patents, trademarks, trade secrets, and similar
intellectual property, including its rights to certain domain names, as critical
to its success. It relies upon trademark, patent and copyright law, trade secret
protection and confidentiality or license agreements with its employees,
customers, partners, and others to protect its proprietary rights. For example,
it has obtained trademark registration for "Autoweb," "Autoweb.com," "Take The
Wheel" and "Autokey." It attempts to ensure that the quality of its brand is
maintained by its licensees, however, its licensees may take actions that could
materially adversely affect the value of its proprietary rights or the
reputation of its products. Protection of the distinctive elements of
"Autoweb.com" may not be available under the law. It cannot guarantee that the
steps it has taken to protect its proprietary rights will be adequate.

PRIVACY POLICY

     Autoweb believes that issues relating to privacy and use of personal
information relating to Internet users are becoming increasingly important as
the Internet expands and its commercial use increases. Autoweb has adopted and
posted to the Web site a privacy policy concerning how Autoweb uses information
about its consumer visitors and the extent to which others may have access to
this information. It uses information about its consumer visits for internal
purposes in order to improve marketing and promotional efforts to analyze Web
site usage statistically and to improve content, product offerings and Web site
layout. Any refinements of its privacy policy will be clearly disclosed to its
Web site visitors.

EMPLOYEES

     As of March 31, 2001, Autoweb had 152 full-time employees, including 48 in
sales and marketing and 104 in general and administration. Autoweb has never had
a work stoppage, and no employees are represented under collective bargaining
agreements.

PROPERTIES

     Autoweb's principal administrative, marketing and product development
facilities are located in approximately 23,880 square feet of office space in
Santa Clara, California. The lease for this space expires on August 1, 2004 and
does not provide for a renewal option. It also leases office space in
Westborough, Massachusetts, Los Angeles, California and Detroit, Michigan. It
believes that these spaces will be adequate to meet its needs in the foreseeable
future.

LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

     In April and May 2001, ______ purported class action lawsuits were filed in
the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York against
Autoweb's current and former directors and officers and underwriters involved in
Autoweb's initial public offering. The complaints allege violations of the
Securities Act of 1933 and of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 involving
alleged undisclosed compensation to the underwriters and seek unspecified
damages. Autoweb believes it has meritorious defenses to the complaints and
intends to vigorously defend the action.

      AUTOWEB MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION
                           AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

     You should read the following discussion of Autoweb's results of operations
and financial condition in conjunction with Autoweb's consolidated financial
statements and related notes included elsewhere in this joint proxy
statement/prospectus. This discussion contains forward-looking statements based
on current expectations that involve risks and uncertainties. Actual results and
the timing of certain events may differ significantly from those projected in
such forward-looking statements due to a number of factors, including those
discussed in the section entitled "Risk Factors" in this joint proxy
statement/prospectus.

OVERVIEW

     Autoweb.com is a leading consumer automotive Internet service. Autoweb's
Web site centralizes an extensive collection of automotive-related commerce,
content and community offerings to assist consumers in researching, evaluating
and buying vehicles and automotive-related products and services such as
insurance and financing. In addition, Autoweb provides automotive content, Web
hosting and development services and sales automation services to vehicle
manufacturers, dealers and online partners. Through its acquisition of
Automotive Information Center, or AIC, in 1999, it now provides consumers and
automotive professionals with Autosite.com, a 20,000-page online vehicle buyer's
guide and a rich suite of related services information and original automotive
editorial content.

     Autoweb began selling its services to automobile dealers and launched the
Autoweb Web site for consumer use in October 1995. Currently its network of
member dealers (where each franchise and pre-owned location for a particular
vehicle manufacturer is defined as a member dealer) is approximately 4,400. It
currently derives approximately 60% of its revenues from fees charged to its
member dealers in exchange for qualified purchase inquiries. The revenue related
to each fee is recognized in the month the qualified purchase inquiry is
provided to the member dealer. Autoweb also provides online advertising space on
the Autoweb site. Revenues from advertising contracts, which typically have
terms of less than three months, are recognized as the contracts are fulfilled.
In addition, it offers automotive-related services on the Autoweb site through
agreements with third-party category partners. It derives revenues from third
parties for the right to provide its consumer services, such as automobile
financing and insurance, on its Web site. Revenues from these agreements are
generally recognized ratably over the terms of the agreements.

     Autoweb incurred net losses of $38.4 million, $18.2 million and $11.5
million in 2000, 1999 and 1998, respectively, and $19.1 million for the three
months ended March 31, 2001. Its limited operating history makes it difficult to
forecast future operating results. It cannot be certain that net revenues will
increase at a rate sufficient to achieve and maintain profitability. Even if it
were to achieve profitability in any period, it might fail to sustain or
increase that profitability on a quarterly or annual basis.

     During 1999, Autoweb acquired technology and other assets from
SalesEnhancer for approximately $3.7 million in cash. SalesEnhancer is an
Internet based sales management application for the automotive industry. Also
during 1999, Autoweb acquired certain assets and liabilities of AIC, a division
of the Gale Group, Inc., for 363,636 shares of common stock valued at $3.3
million and $16.0 million in cash.

     On April 11, 2001, Autoweb entered into a definitive merger agreement with
Autobytel. The merger is expected to close early in the third calendar quarter
of 2001 upon satisfaction of customary and other closing conditions and receipt
of governmental and stockholder approvals. Under the terms of the agreement,
Autoweb stockholders will receive 0.3553 shares of Autobytel common stock in
exchange for each share of Autoweb common stock. Outstanding stock options to
purchase shares of Autoweb common stock will be assumed after adjustment at the
same exchange ratio. Autobytel intends to account for the merger as a purchase
transaction.

THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2001 AND 2000

NET REVENUES

     Autoweb's net revenues decreased to $10.1 million in the first quarter of
2001, from $15.8 million in the first quarter of 2000, an overall decrease of
36%. Approximately 109% of the decrease in net revenues was due to lower net
dealer fees. This was partially offset by higher manufacturer sales. The
decrease in net dealer fee revenue is primarily the result of decreases in the
number of purchase inquiries that Autoweb provided to our member dealers, and
automotive-related vendors or category partners.

COST OF NET REVENUES

     Cost of net revenues increased to $1.9 million in the first quarter of 2001
from $1.7 million in the first quarter of 2000. The increase was due to higher
revenue sharing costs partially offset by lower Web site operation costs
including personnel and site content. The increase in revenue sharing costs is
the result of the increase in pay-for-performance marketing arrangements.

SALES AND MARKETING

     Autoweb's sales and marketing expenses decreased to $8.4 million in the
first quarter of 2001 from $14.7 million in the first quarter of 2000.
Approximately 63% of the decrease in sales and marketing expenses was due to
lower offline advertising. Approximately 11% of the decrease was due to lower
tradeshow costs. A majority of the remaining decrease was the result of lower
salary and salary related costs.

SALES AND MARKETING -- SETTLEMENT CHARGE

     Our sales and marketing -- settlement charge in the first quarter of 2001
was $12.6 million. The settlement charge is the result of the payments made to a
related party shareholder to terminate and settle all outstanding commitments
under an advertising agreement.

PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT

     Autoweb's product development expenses decreased to $1.6 million in the
first quarter of 2001 from $1.9 million in the first quarter of 2000. The
decrease is primarily due to lower salary and salary related costs.

GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE

     Autoweb's general and administrative expenses decreased to $2.4 million in
the first quarter of 2001 from $3.3 million in the first quarter of 2000.
Approximately 75% of the decrease in general and administrative is due to lower
salary costs, while approximately 38% of the decrease in general and
administrative expenses was due to decreases in personnel costs attributable to
the recruiting of administrative personnel.

AMORTIZATION OF INTANGIBLE ASSETS

     Autoweb's amortization of intangible assets expense was $1.8 million in the
first quarter of 2001 and $1.7 million in the first quarter of 2000. All of the
amortization expense was due to the acquisition of certain intangibles described
below. In July 1999, Autoweb entered into an agreement with SalesEnhancer.com,
LLC (SalesEnhancer) to acquire certain technology and other assets and certain
liabilities for $3.7 million in cash. In October 1999, Autoweb entered into an
agreement with The Gale Group, Inc., a subsidiary of the Thompson Company, Inc.,
to acquire certain assets and liabilities of AIC for $19.3 million in cash and
common stock.

STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION

     Autoweb's stock-based compensation expense decreased to $312,000 in the
first quarter of 2001 from $419,000 in the first quarter of 2000. The decrease
reflects cancellations of previously recorded unearned stock based compensation
charges due to employee terminations. Stock based compensation expense has been
allocated to the relevant functional expense categories within operating
expenses.

INTEREST AND OTHER INCOME, NET

     Autoweb's interest and other income, net, increased to $325,000 in the
first quarter of 2001 from $318,000 in the first quarter of 2000.

YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2000, 1999 AND 1998

     Reclassification. Stock-based compensation expense has been reclassified to
the relevant functional expense categories in the years ended December 31, 1999
and 1998 to conform with the presentation for the year ended December 31, 2000.
The reclassification has no impact on the previously reported operating loss or
net loss.

     Net Revenues. Net revenues were $52.3 million, $32.8 million, and $13.0
million for the years ended December 31, 2000, 1999, and 1998, respectively. The
increase in net revenues from 1999 to 2000 was primarily driven by increased net
dealer revenue fees which accounted for 63% of the increase, the fact that the
fiscal year ended December 31, 2000 contained twelve months of revenues from AIC
which accounted for 24% of the increase, with the majority of the remaining
increase driven by advertising. The increase in net revenues from 1998 to 1999
was driven by increased net dealer revenue fees which accounted for 58% of the
increase and increases in revenues from advertising accounted for a majority of
the remaining increase. The increases in net dealer fee revenues in 2000 and
1999 are primarily the result

of increases in the number of purchase inquiries that Autoweb provided to
Autoweb's member dealers and automotive-related vendors, or category partners.

     Cost of Net Revenues. Cost of net revenues were $6.7 million, $3.3 million,
and $842,000 for the years ended December 31, 2000, 1999, and 1998,
respectively. The increase in cost of revenues from 1999 to 2000 was primarily
driven by increases in partner lead fees which accounted for 58% of the increase
and Web site operation costs which accounted for a majority of the remaining
increase. The increase in cost of revenues from 1998 to 1999 was driven by
increases in partner lead fees, which accounted for 42% of the increase, Web
site operations, which accounted for 42% of the increase and providing site
content information which accounted for a majority of the remaining increase.
The increases in 2000 and 1999 partner lead fees are related to the expansion in
the number of co-branded sites and affiliate relationships which has increased
the number of consumer purchase inquiries.

     Sales and Marketing. Sales and marketing expenses were $53.6 million, $34.7
million, and $16.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2000, 1999, and
1998, respectively. The increase in sales and marketing costs from 1999 to 2000
was primarily the result of increases in on-line advertising which accounted for
81% of the increase, increases in personnel costs, which accounted for 14% of
the increase as well as the fact that the year ended December 31, 2000 contained
twelve months of AIC sales and marketing costs. The increase in sales and
marketing costs from 1998 to 1999 was primarily driven by increases in on-line
advertising which accounted for 81% of the increase, and to a lesser extent,
increases in public relations costs, advertising in traditional media, trade
shows, and other promotions. Sales and marketing expenses include $525,000, $1.5
million and $3.0 million of stock based compensation expense for the years 2000,
1999 and 1998, respectively.

     Product Development. Product development expenses were $8.9 million, $5.7
million, and $1.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2000, 1999, and 1998,
respectively. The increase in product development costs from 1999 to 2000 and
from 1998 to 1999 increased primarily as a result of increased hiring of product
development personnel and, to a lesser extent, as a result of increased
occupancy costs. Product development expenses include ($26,000), $571,000 and
$1.2 million of stock based compensation expense for the years 2000, 1999 and
1998, respectively

     General and Administrative. General and administrative expenses were $13.0
million, $7.4 million, and $5.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2000,
1999, and 1998, respectively. The increase in general and administrative costs
from 1999 to 2000 was primarily driven by the fact that general and
administrative costs for the year ended December 31, 2000, contained twelve
months of AIC costs which accounted for approximately 65% of the increase, the
remaining increase was primarily due to twelve months of SalesEnhancer costs.
The increase in general and administrative costs from 1998 to 1999 was driven by
higher personnel costs resulting from the hiring of administrative personnel
which accounted for 37% of the increase, higher information technology support
related to administrative functions, higher occupancy costs, and increases in
professional consulting fees. General and administrative expenses include $1.1
million, $207,000, and $1.5 million of stock based compensation expense for the
years 2000, 1999 and 1998, respectively.

     Amortization of Intangible Assets. Amortization of intangible assets was
$7.0 million and $1.9 million, for the years ended December 31, 2000 and 1999,
respectively. The increase in amortization from 1999 to 2000 was primarily
driven by twelve months amortization related to the acquisition of AIC which
accounted for 88% of the increase with the remaining increase due to the
acquisition of SalesEnhancer. The amortization in 1999 was related to the
acquisition of AIC which accounted for 87% of the amortization, with
SalesEnhancer accounting for the remaining portion.

     Interest and Other Income (Expense), Net. Interest and other income
(expense), net were $1.6 million, $2.1 million, and ($59,000), for the years
ended December 31, 2000, 1999, and 1998, respectively. The decrease in interest
and other income (expense) net from 1999 to 2000 is primarily the result of a
lower average investment balance during 2000 driven primarily by Autoweb's net
loss for the year, partially offset by the issuance of common stock for a total
of $29.8 million. The increase in interest

and other income (expense), net from 1998 to 1999 was primarily driven by a
higher average investment balance during 1999 as a result of net proceeds from
its initial public offering.

     Loss on Investment. The loss on investment of $3.1 million in 2000 relates
to an impairment write-down of an investment in the equity securities of a
private company.

     Income Taxes. Autoweb recorded a net loss of $38.4 million, $18.2 million,
and $11.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2000, 1999, and 1998,
respectively. Accordingly, no provision for income taxes was recorded in any of
these years. The resulting tax deferred asset, representing primarily such net
operating loss carry forwards, has been reduced in full by a valuation allowance
as it is more likely than not that the deferred tax asset will not be realized.

     Liquidity and Capital Resources. Net cash used in operating activities was
$13.7 million in the three months ended March 31, 2001 compared to net cash used
in operations of $7.4 million in the three months ended March 31, 2000. Net cash
used in operating activities in the three months ended March 31, 2001 was
primarily due to the net loss of $19.1 million for the period which includes the
settlement charge of $12.6 million and decreases in accounts payable of $1.3
million partially offset by decreases in prepaid expenses of $4.4 million and
depreciation and amortization expense of $1.8 million and stock based
compensation expense of $312,000. Net cash used in operating activities in the
three months ended March 31, 2000 of $7.4 million was primarily due to the net
loss of $7.2 million.

     Net cash used in investing activities was $98,000 in the first three months
of 2001 and was primarily the result of the acquisition of property and
equipment. Net cash provided by investing activities was $20.4 million in the
first three months of 2000 and was primarily the result of the maturity of short
term investments.

     Net cash used in financing activities was $108,000 for the first three
months of 2001 and was the result of principal payments under notes payable and
capital lease obligations. Net cash provided by financing activities was
$326,000 for the first three months of 2000 and resulted primarily from the
issuance of common stock.

     Net cash used in operating activities was $31.1 million, $24.2 million, and
$4.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2000, 1999, and 1998,
respectively. Net cash used in operating activities in 2000 was primarily due to
the net loss for the year of $38.4 million, partially offset by amortization of
intangible assets of $7.0 million related to the acquisitions of AIC and
SalesEnhancer. Net cash used in operating activities in 1999 was primarily due
to the net loss for the year, the increase in prepaid expenses and other current
assets, accounts receivable and restricted cash. Net cash used in operating
activities in 1998 was primarily due to net losses for the year offset in part
by the amortization of stock-based compensation.

     Net cash (used in) provided by investing activities was $18.8 million,
($40.8) million, and ($1.2) million for the years ended December 31, 2000, 1999,
and 1998, respectively. The increase in cash provided by investing activities
from 1999 to 2000 was primarily due to the maturity of short-term investments
purchased in 1999 which accounted for $41.8 million of the increase while cash
used of $16.0 million to purchase AIC in 1999 accounted for a majority of the
remaining variance. The increase in cash used in investing activities from 1998
to 1999 is primarily the result of the purchase of short-term investments as
well as cash paid in 1999 for the acquisition of AIC.

     Net cash provided by financing activities was $30.0 million, $71.7 million,
and $6.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2000, 1999, and 1998,
respectively. The decrease in cash provided by financing activities from 1999 to
2000 is primarily the result of net proceeds of $71.7 million received in 1999
from the issuance of common stock in its initial public offering. During 2000
the company issued common stock to both Lycos, Inc. and CarsDirect for a total
of $29.8 million in cash.

     During 2000 Autoweb recognized approximately $3.4 million of revenue from
dealer sales to CarsDirect and was compensated by the issuance of preferred
stock, valued at $3.1 million, in the non-public company and cash of
approximately $300,000. Subsequently in 2000 Autoweb recorded a

charge of $3.1 million to reflect an other than temporary impairment in the
value of those preferred shares. In addition, in April 2000, CarsDirect
purchased newly-issued shares of common stock of Autoweb that represented less
than 3% of its outstanding shares for $7.7 million in 2000.

     During the fourth quarter of 2000 Autoweb announced two initiatives to
focus resources and exercise fiscal control. First, during the fourth quarter
Autoweb reduced its workforce by approximately 25% in an effort to focus on
content and technology offerings, order fulfillment and customer relationship
management for the automotive industry. The annual savings from the reduced
workforce is estimated to be approximately $10 million. Second, Autoweb
commenced efforts to reduce its marketing costs through the restructure of
certain marketing agreements. These efforts are crucial if Autoweb is to reduce
its future operating loss. In this regard, Autoweb paid $13.3 million in March
2001 so that as of March 31, 2001 Autoweb has reduced its future marketing cash
obligations to $22.0 million, from $56.8 million at December 31, 2000. As
Autoweb's marketing agreements are restructured, it is critical to Autoweb's
success that it is able to replace any reduced or lost traffic.

     Autoweb had no material commitments for capital expenditures at December
31, 2000. As of that date, Autoweb had total minimum lease obligations of $3.6
million under certain non-cancelable operating leases. Autoweb believes that its
current cash and cash equivalents will be sufficient to meet its anticipated
needs for working capital and capital expenditures for at least the next 12
months. Depending on Autoweb's rate of growth and cash requirements, it may
require additional equity or debt financing to meet future working capital or
capital expenditure needs. There can be no assurance that such additional
financing will be available, or if available, that such financing can be
obtained on terms satisfactory to Autoweb.

     At March 31, 2001, the total of our cash and cash equivalents was $13.2
million. We believe that our current cash position together with anticipated
future revenues will be sufficient to meet our cash requirements for at least
the next 12 months. Depending on our rate of growth and cash requirements, we
may require additional equity or debt financing to meet future working capital
or capital expenditure needs. Autoweb's failure to raise capital when needed
could have a material adverse effect on its business, financial condition and
operating results. Autoweb's future liquidity may be impacted if its shares are
delisted from the NASDAQ National Market.

RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS

     In June 1998, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued SFAS No. 133,
"Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities." SFAS No. 133, as
amended, is effective for all fiscal quarters of all years beginning after June
15, 2000. SFAS No. 133 requires companies to record derivatives on the balance
sheet as assets or liabilities, measured at fair market value. Under SFAS No.
133, gains or losses resulting from changes in the values of derivatives are to
be reported in the statement of operations or as a deferred item, depending on
the use of the derivatives and whether they qualify for hedge accounting. The
Company is required to adopt SFAS No. 133 in the first quarter of 2001. To date,
the Company has not engaged in any hedging activity and adoption of this new
standard has not had a significant impact on the Company.

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURE ABOUT MARKET RISK

     Autoweb considered the provisions of Financial Reporting Release No. 48,
"Disclosure of Accounting Policies for Derivative Financial Instruments and
Derivative Commodity Instruments, and Disclosure of Quantitative and Qualitative
Information about Market Risk Inherent in Derivative Financial Instruments,
Other Financial Instruments and Derivative Commodity Instruments." Autoweb had
no holdings of derivative financial or commodity instruments at December 31,
2000. However, Autoweb is exposed to financial market risks, including changes
in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates. The majority of Autoweb's
revenue, expenses and capital expenditures are transacted in U.S. dollars.

     The objectives of Autoweb's investment policy are the safety and
preservation of invested funds, and liquidity of investments that is sufficient
to meet cash flow requirements. Autoweb's policy is to place its

cash, cash equivalents, and investments available for sale with high credit
quality financial institutions, commercial companies, and government agencies in
order to limit the amount of credit exposure. Autoweb's investment policy also
provides that its investment portfolio must not have an average portfolio
maturity of beyond one year and that Autoweb must maintain liquidity positions.
Autoweb's investment policy prohibits investments in industries and speculative
activities and requires investments be denominated in U.S. dollars.

(1) All options are either incentive stock options or nonqualified stock options
    and generally vest monthly over four years from the issuance date at the
    rate of 2.0833% of the shares per month, except that no shares vest until
    the optionee's first anniversary of employment, at which time a number of
    shares equal to 2.0833% of the shares multiplied by the number of months
    between issuance and the optionee's first anniversary of employment become
    vested. Options expire ten years from the date of grant, subject to earlier
    termination upon termination of employment.

(2) Based on options to purchase a total of 2,819,381 shares of common stock
    granted during 2000.

(3) Options were granted at an exercise price equal to the fair market value of
    Autoweb common stock on grant date.

(4) Potential realizable values are computed by (a) multiplying the number of
    shares of common stock subject to a given option by the market price of such
    option on the date of grant, (b) assuming that the aggregate stock value
    derived from that calculation compounds at the annual 5% and 10% rates shown
    in the table for the entire ten-year term of the option and (c) subtracting
    from the result the aggregate option exercise price. The 5% and 10% assumed
    annual rates of stock price appreciation are mandated by the rules of the
    Securities and Exchange Commission and do not represent Autoweb's estimate
    or projection of future common stock prices.

(5) Jeffrey Schwartz's options vested 10% on the date of grant, with an
    additional 15% of the remaining balance upon the first anniversary of the
    grant date, and the balance thereafter vests at a rate of 2.0833% monthly

     EMPLOYMENT CONTRACTS AND TERMINATION OF EMPLOYMENT AND CHANGE-IN-CONTROL
ARRANGEMENTS.

     In May 2000, the board of directors adopted a Change of Control Benefit
Plan, or COC Plan. Upon a change of control of Autoweb, the vesting of 75% of
the stock underlying any stock options or restricted stock held by participants
will accelerate. In the event the participant is terminated without cause or
terminates their employment for good reason, within one year following a change
of control of Autoweb, any unvested stock options or restricted stock will be
immediately exercisable. In addition, the participant will receive a cash lump
sum payment equal to any unpaid base salary plus an amount equal to a pro-rated
bonus of up to 35% of base salary and an amount equal to one year of their base
salary multiplied by their severance multiple. In January 2001, Jeffrey
Schwartz, Regan Senkarik, Fred Ruffin, Nadyne Edison, Jerome Karr and other
executive officers elected to become participants in the COC Plan.

     Under the terms of an offer letter between the Autoweb and Dean DeBiase,
dated December 16, 1998, as amended March 30, 2001, if Mr. DeBiase is terminated
for any reason other than cause, he will receive a lump sum payment equal to one
year of his then current salary and may continue to participate in certain
retirement, medical and other plans for one year following his termination. In
the event of a change of control of Autoweb, 75% of Mr. DeBiase's unvested stock
options or restricted stock will be immediately exercisable. Furthermore, if
within one year following a change of control of Autoweb, Mr. DeBiase's
employment is terminated for any reason other than cause or he terminates his
employment for good reason, in addition to the termination benefits mentioned
above, any unvested stock options or restricted stock will be immediately
exercisable, and he will receive an amount equal to a pro-rated bonus, not to
exceed 35% of his total then current salary.

     On November 5, 1999, Autoweb entered into an employment agreement with
Samuel Hedgpeth. In the event Mr. Hedgpeth was terminated for any reason other
than cause, Mr. Hedgpeth would receive severance payments at his final salary
rate and benefits for the nine month period following his termination, plus
compensation and benefits earned through his date of termination, and 75% of his
unvested stock options would become immediately exercisable. In the event of a
change of control, 75% of any unvested options would become immediately
exercisable if Mr. Hedgpeth was not retained by the acquiring company. Mr.
Hedgpeth resigned his positions as President and Chief Executive Officer in
November 2000.

COMPENSATION COMMITTEE INTERLOCKS AND INSIDER PARTICIPATION

     None of the members of the compensation committee of the board of directors
has at any time since Autoweb's formation been an officer or employee of
Autoweb. No executive officer of Autoweb serves as a member of the board of
directors or compensation committee of any entity that has one or more executive
officers serving on Autoweb's board of directors or compensation committee.

        AUTOWEB COMPENSATION COMMITTEE REPORT ON EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION

     This report on executive compensation is required by the Securities and
Exchange Commission and shall not be deemed to be incorporated by reference by
any general statement incorporating by reference this joint proxy
statement/prospectus into any filing under the Securities Act, or under the
Exchange Act, except to the extent that Autoweb specifically incorporates this
information by reference, and shall not otherwise be deemed soliciting material
or filed under such Acts.

     Final decisions regarding executive compensation and stock option grants to
executives are made by the compensation committee of the board of directors. The
compensation committee is composed of three independent non-employee directors,
none of whom have any interlocking relationships as defined by the Securities
and Exchange Commission.

GENERAL COMPENSATION POLICY

     The compensation committee acts on behalf of the board of directors to
establish the general compensation policy of Autoweb for all employees of
Autoweb. The compensation committee typically reviews base salary levels and
target bonuses for the Chairman of the Board, the Chief Executive Officer and
other executive officers and employees of Autoweb during the first quarter of
each year. The compensation committee administers Autoweb's incentive and equity
plans, including the 1999 Equity Incentive Plan and the 1999 Employee Stock
Purchase Plan.

     The compensation committee's philosophy in compensating all employees,
including the Chairman of the Board and the Chief Executive Officer, is to
relate compensation to both corporate and individual performance. Thus,
Autoweb's general compensation policy, which applies to all employees of
Autoweb, relates a portion of each individual's total compensation to the
company-wide management, financial and individual objectives set forth quarterly
and at the beginning of the year. Consistent with this policy, a designated
portion of the compensation of the executive officers of Autoweb is contingent
on corporate performance and, in the case of certain executive officers,
adjusted based on the individual officer's performance as measured against
personal objectives, as determined by the compensation committee in its
discretion. Long-term equity incentives for executive officers are effected
through the granting of stock options under the incentive plan. Stock options
generally have value for the executive only if the price of Autoweb's stock
increases above the fair market value on the grant date and the executive
remains in Autoweb's employ for the period required for the options to vest.

     The base salaries, incentive compensation and stock option grants of the
executive officers are determined in part by the compensation committee
informally reviewing data on prevailing compensation practices in technology
companies with whom Autoweb competes for executive talent, and by their
evaluating such information in connection with Autoweb's corporate goals. In
addition, the compensation committee occasionally commissions consultants to
review current compensation levels in the context of the market environment. To
this end, the compensation committee attempts to compare the compensation of
Autoweb's executive officers with the compensation practices of comparable
companies to determine base salary, target bonuses and target total cash
compensation. In addition to their base salaries, Autoweb's executive officers,
including the Chairman of the Board and the Chief Executive Officer, are each
eligible to receive a cash bonus and to participate in the 1999 Equity Incentive
Plan and the 1999 Employee Stock Purchase Plan.

2000 EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION

     Base Compensation. The compensation committee reviewed individual and
company performance and established a base salary level to be effective January
1, 2000 or, in the case of promotions, at the effective point, for each
executive officer, including the Chief Executive Officer.

     Incentive Compensation. Cash bonuses were awarded during 2000 only if an
executive officer achieved predetermined individual performance goals and
Autoweb met predetermined corporate objectives set by the compensation
committee. In certain cases, such as for the Chief Executive Officer, cash
bonuses

were paid exclusively based on rates stipulated in individual offer letters.
During 2000, these objectives were set quarterly in accordance with the
incentive plan implemented during the fourth quarter of 1999. The chief
executive officer's subjective judgment of executives' performance (other than
his own) was taken into account in determining whether those goals have been
satisfied. The target amount of bonus and the actual amount of bonus are
determined by the compensation committee, in its discretion. Cash bonuses were
paid to executive officers during the first and second quarter of 2000. No cash
bonuses were paid during the third and fourth quarters of 2000, other than those
stipulated in individual offer letters.

     Stock Options. Stock options are an essential element of Autoweb's
executive compensation package. The compensation committee believes that
equity-based compensation in the form of stock options links the interests of
management and stockholders by focusing employees and management on increasing
stockholder value. The actual value of such equity-based compensation depends
entirely on appreciation of Autoweb's stock. Approximately 100% of Autoweb's
full-time employees participate in the incentive plan.

     In 2000, stock options were granted to each executive officer except Mr.
DeBiase and Mr. Schmidt, who joined Autoweb in December. Stock options typically
have been granted to executive officers when the executive first joins Autoweb,
in connection with a significant change in responsibilities and, occasionally,
to achieve equity within a peer group. The compensation committee may, however,
grant additional stock options to executives for other reasons. The number of
shares subject to each stock option granted is within the discretion of the
compensation committee and is based on anticipated future contribution and
ability to impact corporate and/or business unit results, past performance or
consistency within the executive's peer group. In 2000, the compensation
committee considered these factors, as well as the number of options held by
such executive officers that remained unvested. In the discretion of the
compensation committee, executive officers may also be granted stock options to
provide greater incentives to continue their employment with Autoweb and to
strive to increase the value of Autoweb's common stock. The stock options
generally become exercisable over either a three-year or four-year period and
are granted at a price that is equal to the fair market value of Autoweb's
common stock on the date of grant. In granting options, particular attention was
given to the company-wide management objectives and the executive officers'
success in obtaining specific individual financial and operational objectives
established for 2000 and to the number of options currently held by the
executive officers that remain unvested.

     Company Performance, Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer
Compensation. Messrs. DeBiase, Hedgpeth and Schwartz were responsible for
Autoweb achieving a significant portion of its objectives for 2000. These
objectives included satisfactorily managing Autoweb's overall corporate business
plan, such as meeting Autoweb's revenue targets and significantly strengthening
Autoweb's market position. Based upon the criteria set forth under the
discussion of "Incentive Compensation" above, the compensation committee awarded
Mr. DeBiase incentive compensation of $100,000. The compensation committee
awarded Mr. Hedgpeth incentive compensation of $36,000. These figures represent
the bonus guaranteed in Mr. DeBiase's offer letter and 100% of the target bonus
for Mr. Hedgpeth. Mr. DeBiase was not granted any stock options in 2000, after
consideration of his prior outstanding option grants and the number of options
that remained unexercisable, and the number of shares Mr. DeBiase already owns.
In 1999, Mr. Hedgpeth was awarded options to purchase aggregate of 304,987
shares of Autoweb's common stock. In 2000, Mr. Schwartz was granted options to
purchase 70,000 shares of Autoweb's common stock. The compensation committee
reviewed the compensation practices of the comparable companies in determining
the compensation for Messrs. DeBiase, Hedgpeth and Schwartz.

     Compliance with Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code of
1986. Autoweb intends to comply with the requirements of Section 162(m) of the
Code. The incentive plan is already in compliance with Section 162(m) by
limiting stock awards to named executive officers. Autoweb does not expect cash
compensation for 2001 to be in excess of $1,000,000 or consequently to be
affected by the requirements of Section 162(m).

                    REPORT OF THE AUDIT COMMITTEE OF AUTOWEB

     This report of the audit committee is required by the Securities and
Exchange Commission and shall not be deemed to be incorporated by reference by
any general statement incorporating by reference this joint proxy
statement/prospectus into any filing under the Securities Act, or under the
Exchange Act, except to the extent that Autoweb specifically incorporates this
information by reference, and shall not otherwise be deemed soliciting material
or filed under such Acts.

     The audit committee of Autoweb is composed of three independent directors
and operates under a written charter approved by the audit committee and adopted
by the board of directors, which is attached to this joint proxy
statement/prospectus as Annex E. The members of the audit committee are Jay C.
Hoag, Lawrence W. Lepard and Mark R. Ross. The audit committee recommends to the
board of directors, subject to stockholder ratification, the selection of
Autoweb's independent accountants.

     Management is responsible for Autoweb's internal controls and the financial
reporting process. The independent accountants are responsible for performing an
independent audit of Autoweb's consolidated financial statements in accordance
with generally accepted auditing standards and to issue a report thereon. The
audit committee's responsibility is to monitor and oversee these processes.

     In this context, the audit committee has met and held discussions with
management and the independent accountants. Management represented to the audit
committee that Autoweb's consolidated financial statements were prepared in
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and the audit
committee has reviewed and discussed the consolidated financial statements with
management and the independent accountants. The audit committee discussed with
the independent accountants matters required to be discussed by Statement on
Auditing Standards No. 61, "Communication with Audit Committees."

     Autoweb's independent accountants also provided to the audit committee the
written disclosures required by Independence Standards Board Standard No. 1,
"Independence Discussions with Audit Committees," and the audit committee
discussed with the independent accountants that firm's independence.

     Based upon the audit committee's discussion with management and the
independent accountants and the audit committee's review of the representation
of management and the report of the independent accountants to the audit
committee, the audit committee recommended that the board of directors include
the audited consolidated financial statements in Autoweb's Annual Report on Form
10-K for the year ended December 31, 2000 filed with the Securities and Exchange
Commission.

SECTION 16(a) BENEFICIAL OWNERSHIP REPORTING COMPLIANCE

     Section 16 of the Exchange Act requires Autoweb's directors and officers,
and persons who own more than 10% of a registered class of Autoweb's equity
securities, to file initial reports of ownership and reports of changes in
ownership with the Commission. Such persons are required by regulation to
furnish Autoweb with copies of all Section 16(a) forms they file.

     Based solely on its review of the copies of such forms furnished to Autoweb
and written representations from the executive officers and directors of
Autoweb, Autoweb believes that all Section 16(a) filing requirements were met
during 2000, except that one Form 3, reporting no transactions, for William
Barrett was filed late, one Form 4, reporting two transactions, for William
Barrett was filed late, one Form 3,

CERTAIN RELATIONSHIPS AND RELATED TRANSACTIONS

     From January 1, 2000 to the present, there have been no currently proposed
transactions in which the amount involved exceeds $60,000 to which Autoweb or
any of its subsidiaries was (or is to be) a party and in which any executive
officer, director, 5% beneficial owner of Autoweb's common stock or member of
the immediate family of any of the foregoing persons had (or will have) a direct
or indirect material interest, except for compensatory payments disclosed where
required under "Proposal No. 1 -- Election of Directors -- Director
Compensation" and "Executive Compensation" above and the transactions described
below.

     Officer Loans. In January 1999, Dean DeBiase, Autoweb's Chairman and Chief
Executive Officer, borrowed an aggregate of $921,982 from Autoweb pursuant to
three full-recourse, three-year, interest free promissory notes in the amounts
of $100,000, $686,396 and $135,586 in connection with the exercise of his
options to purchase 199,999 shares of common stock and 395,661 shares of Autoweb
Series D Preferred Stock. The $100,000 note is secured by the 199,999 shares of
common stock purchased and the $636,396 and $135,586 promissory notes are each
secured by the 395,661 shares of common stock into which the purchased Series D
Preferred Stock automatically converted at the time of Autoweb's initial public
offering. As of April 12, 2000, the full $921,982 continued to remain
outstanding. At September 30, 2000, Autoweb's had full recourse promissory notes
receivable in the amount of approximately $960,000, approximately $922,000 of
which is from Dean DeBiase, Autoweb's Chairman and approximately $38,000 of
which is from Samuel Hedgpeth, Autoweb's former President and Chief Executive
Officer.

     Lycos, Inc. Agreement. In March 2000, Autoweb and Lycos, Inc. entered into
a four year agreement under which a co-branded version of the Autoweb Web site
would be accessible across Lycos' network and all its Web properties. Major
elements of the Agreement included regularly scheduled payments to Lycos for
impressions, integration, and exclusivity. The amount of payments to Lycos over
four years under this Agreement totaled $32 million. The Agreement called for a
split of net advertising revenue on the co-branded site that was tiered by the
amount of gross revenue and varies from year to the year. Autoweb also received
a percentage of revenue from the placement of advertising on the Lycos Network
in areas and on properties other than the co-branded site for customers that
Autoweb referred to Lycos. Lycos shared in a fixed amount of revenue per
transaction from those transactions on the co-branded site, if any, above a
minimum threshold dollar amount in total. In April 2000, in connection with the
Agreement, Lycos acquired 3,035,025 shares of Autoweb's common stock for
$21,846,110.

     On March 21, 2001, the four year agreement was terminated by mutual consent
and a final payment of $13.3. million was paid to Lycos in settlement of
Autoweb's then-outstanding commitments. On April 2, 2001, Autoweb and Lycos
entered into a new three year nonexclusive agreement to receive certain content
and customer referrals from the co-branded site, along with certain advertising
revenue generated from the co-branded site.

appropriate action with respect to any proposal that does not comply with these
and other applicable requirements.

     It is not anticipated that Autoweb will hold an annual meeting in 2002;
however, if Autoweb does hold an annual meeting, any stockholder who wishes to
submit a proposal or present a nomination must provide written notice of the
nomination or other business to the Secretary of Autoweb no later than January
12, 2002 in order to be included in the proxy statement and form of proxy
relating to that meeting. The Autoweb by-laws require that for business to be
properly brought before a stockholders' meeting by a stockholder, the
stockholder must have given timely written notice not later than 60 days, but
not earlier than 90 days, prior to the first anniversary of the preceding year's
annual meeting. Such notice shall specify the name of the stockholder, the class
and number of shares owned by the stockholder, certain information regarding
nominees for director, the general nature of the business proposed to be
transacted, the reasons for conducting such business at the meeting and any
material interest of the stockholder in such business, and shall be delivered
personally to or mailed and received by the secretary of Autoweb. Stockholders
must comply with the procedural requirements in Autoweb's by-laws.

Stockholders can obtain a copy of Autoweb's by-laws from Autoweb. The by-laws
are also on file with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

     In addition, a stockholder who intends to present a proposal at Autobytel's
or Autoweb's 2002 annual meeting without inclusion of the proposal in the proxy
materials should be aware that the rules of the Securities and Exchange
Commission provide that a proxy may confer discretionary authority on management
to vote on a matter if the proponent fails to timely notify Autobytel or
Autoweb, as applicable. Such proposals must also have met the other requirements
of the rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission relating to stockholder
proposals.

                    REPORT OF INDEPENDENT PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS

To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of autobytel.com inc.:

     We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of
autobytel.com inc., a Delaware corporation, and subsidiaries as of December 31,
2000 and 1999, and the related consolidated statements of operations,
stockholders' equity and cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2000, 1999
and 1998. These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the
Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these
consolidated financial statements based on our audits.

     We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally
accepted in the United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform
the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated
financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes
examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting
principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as
evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our
audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

     In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above
present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of
autobytel.com inc. and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2000 and 1999, and the
results of their operations and their cash flows for the years ended December
31, 2000, 1999 and 1998 in conformity with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States.

1. ORGANIZATION AND OPERATIONS OF AUTOBYTEL

     Autobytel, along with its subsidiaries, is an internationally branded
online automotive commerce company that provides consumers with automotive
solutions throughout the lifecycle of vehicle ownership. Autobytel owns branded
Internet sites for new and pre-owned vehicle information and automotive services
that link buyers and sellers in an information-rich environment. Through its Web
sites (www.autobytel.com and www.carsmart.com), consumers can research pricing,
specifications and other information related to new and pre-owned vehicles and
purchase, finance, lease, insure, sell or maintain their vehicles. When
consumers indicate they are ready to buy a vehicle, they can be connected to
participating dealers in the United States and Canada, or to other sellers
through its classified ads.

     Autobytel has also established international joint ventures and/or
licensing agreements to market new and used vehicles in the United Kingdom,
Sweden, Japan, Australia, The Netherlands and Spain.

     Since its inception in January 1995, Autobytel has invested in marketing
its brand name and developing infrastructure to support anticipated future
operating growth. As a result, Autobytel has experienced significant operating
losses and has an accumulated deficit of $95,627 as of December 31, 2000.
Management believes current cash and cash equivalents are sufficient to meet
anticipated cash needs for working capital and capital expenditures for at least
the next twelve months.

2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Principles of Consolidation

     The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of
autobytel.com and its wholly and majority owned direct and indirect
subsidiaries. Autobytel's wholly and majority owned subsidiaries include:
Autobytel Services Corporation, Auto-By-Tel Acceptance Corporation, Auto-By-Tel
Insurance Services, Inc., Autobytel.ca inc., Kre8.net, inc., e-autosdirect.com
inc., Autobytel.Europe LLC (formerly Auto-By-Tel International LLC),
Autobytel.Europe Investment B.V., Autobytel.Europe Holdings B.V., I-Net Training
Technologies, LLC, Autobytel Acquisition I Corp., Autobytel Information Services
Inc., AutoVisions Communications, Inc. and A.I.N. Corporation.

     Investments in which Autobytel has the ability to exercise significant
influence, but not control, are accounted for using the equity method. Autobytel
accounts for its investments in Autobytel Japan and Autobytel Australia under
the equity method. The application of the equity method against its investment
in Autobytel Japan has been suspended, as its original investment of $126 was
fully expensed in 1999. Autobytel has no basis in its equity investment in
Autobytel Australia and, accordingly, has not recorded any losses. Autobytel
will resume application of the equity method when its share of net income equals
its share of net losses unrecognized during the suspension period.

     All other investments in affiliates are carried at cost. Autobytel accounts
for its investments in Auto-By-Tel AB, Automoviles Bytel S.A., Autoatnet S.A.
and Autobytel France S.A. using the cost method.

     All intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated in
consolidation.

Use of Estimates in the Preparation of Financial Statements

     The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally
accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and
disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial
statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the
reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

             NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)
            (AMOUNTS IN THOUSANDS, EXCEPT SHARE AND PER SHARE DATA)

Cash and Cash Equivalents

     For the purposes of the consolidated balance sheets and the consolidated
statements of cash flows, Autobytel considers all highly liquid investments with
an original maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents.

     As of December 31, 2000, $15,000 is held in a restricted interest bearing
account as a reserve for three foreign exchange forward contracts expiring in
June 2001.

Financial Instruments

     Autobytel does not hold or issue financial instruments for speculative
purposes. Autobytel enters into off-balance sheet foreign currency forward
exchange instruments in order to hedge certain financing and investment
transactions denominated in foreign currencies. Gains and losses on the
investing and financing transactions are included in other income (expense).

Concentration of Credit Risk

     Financial instruments that potentially subject Autobytel to significant
concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of accounts receivable. Accounts
receivable are primarily derived from fees billed to subscribing dealers and
international licencees. Autobytel generally requires no collateral to support
customer receivables and maintains reserves for potential credit losses.
Historically, such losses have been minor and within management's expectations.
As of December 31, 2000 and 1999, no subscribing dealer, international licensee
or other customer accounted for greater than 10% of accounts receivable.

Property and Equipment

     Property and equipment are stated at cost. Depreciation is provided using
the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the respective
assets, generally three years. Amortization of leasehold improvements is
provided using the straight-line method over the shorter of the remaining lease
term or the estimated useful lives of the improvements.

Goodwill

     Goodwill is amortized using the straight-line method over its estimated
useful life, generally 15 years. Amortization expense for the year ended
December 31, 2000 was $1,482.

Capitalized Software in Process

     In accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 86, "Accounting for the Costs of
Computer Software to be Sold, Leased or Otherwise Marketed", Autobytel expenses
software development costs until technological feasibility has been established.
Costs incurred subsequent to technological feasibility are capitalized on a
product by product basis. Amortization is provided using (i) the ratio that
current gross revenues for a product bear to the total of current anticipated
future gross revenues from that product or (ii) the straight-line method over
the remaining estimated economic life of the product, whichever is greater. As
of December 31, 2000, capitalized software in process costs totaled $3,338.
Related amortization expense will be recorded when the product is available for
general release to customers.

             NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)
            (AMOUNTS IN THOUSANDS, EXCEPT SHARE AND PER SHARE DATA)

Stock-Based Compensation

     Autobytel accounts for stock-based compensation in accordance with the
provisions of Accounting Principles Board Opinion (APB) No. 25, "Accounting for
Stock Issued to Employees." Under APB No. 25, compensation expense is recognized
over the vesting period based on the excess of the fair market value over the
exercise price on the grant date. (See Note 9.)

     In 1996, Autobytel adopted SFAS No. 123, "Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation." Autobytel has elected to continue accounting for stock-based
compensation issued to employees using APB No. 25 and, accordingly, proforma
disclosures required under SFAS No. 123 have been presented. (See Note 9.)

Revenue Recognition

     Autobytel's revenues primarily consist of fees paid by subscribing dealers
located in the United States and Canada. These fees are comprised of an initial
fee and a monthly fee. The initial fee is recognized ratably over the service
period of twelve months. The monthly fee is recognized in the period services
are provided.

     Autobytel also derives revenues from license and service agreements with
international licensees. These agreements grant the licensees the right to use
Autobytel's proprietary software, technology and other business procedures to
market new and used vehicles in exchange for certain fees. Revenues from these
fees are recognized in accordance with the provisions of Statement of Position
(SOP) 97-2, "Software Revenue Recognition." These fees include: (i) orientation
fees, which are recognized on the effective date of the license and service
agreements, (ii) localization and development fees and minimum annual
maintenance fees, which are recognized as services are provided, and (iii)
minimum annual license fees, which are recognized ratably over a twelve month
period beginning on the date the international Web site is launched.

     Deferred revenues are comprised of unearned fees.

Risks Due to Concentration of Significant Customers and Export Sales

     For all periods presented in the accompanying consolidated statements of
operations, no subscribing dealer, international licensee or other customer
accounted for greater than 10% of revenues.

     Autobytel conducts its business within one industry segment. Revenues from
customers outside of the United States were less than 10% of total revenues for
all periods presented in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations.

Sales and Marketing

     Sales and marketing expense primarily includes Internet marketing and
advertising expenses, fees paid to purchase request providers, promotion and
advertising expenses to build brand awareness and encourage potential customers
to visit Autobytel's Web sites and personnel and other costs associated with
sales, marketing, training and support of Autobytel's dealer networks. Sales and
marketing costs are recorded as expenses as incurred. For the years ended
December 31, 2000, 1999 and 1998, Internet marketing and advertising costs were
$20,564, $14,288 and $11,090 and television advertising expenses were $10,720,
$8,485 and $5,296 respectively.

Product and Technology Development

     Product and technology development expense primarily includes personnel
costs related to enhancing the features, content and functionality of
Autobytel's Web sites and its Internet-based dealer
                                      F-1-9

                               AUTOBYTEL.COM INC.

             NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)
            (AMOUNTS IN THOUSANDS, EXCEPT SHARE AND PER SHARE DATA)

communications platform. It also includes expenses associated with the
customization of Autobytel's software for international licensees and
telecommunications and computer infrastructure. Product and technology
development expenditures are expensed as incurred or capitalized as appropriate.

General and Administrative

     General and administrative expense primarily consists of executive,
financial and legal personnel expenses, costs related to being a public company
and non-cash compensation charges related to stock options granted in 1999.
Non-cash compensation expense in 2000 and 1999 was $393 and $1,063,
respectively. (See Note 9.) A non-recurring charge of $601 associated with an
aborted acquisition was charged to general and administrative expense in 1999.

Foreign Currency Translation

     The assets and liabilities of Autobytel's foreign subsidiaries are
translated into United States dollars at the current exchange rate as of the
applicable balance sheet date. Revenues and expenses are translated at the
average exchange rate prevailing during the period. Gains and losses resulting
from the translation of the financial statements are reported as a separate
component of stockholders' equity.

     Transaction gains and losses arising from exchange rate fluctuations on
transactions denominated in a currency other than the functional currency,
except those transactions which operate as a hedge of an identifiable foreign
currency commitment or as a hedge of a foreign currency investment position, are
included in other income (expense).

Computation of Basic and Diluted Net Loss Per Share

     Net loss per share has been calculated under SFAS No. 128, "Earnings per
Share." SFAS No. 128 requires companies to compute earnings per share under two
different methods (basic and diluted). Basic net loss per share is calculated by
dividing the net loss by the weighted average shares of common stock outstanding
during the period. For the years ended December 31, 2000, 1999 and 1998, diluted
net loss per share is equal to basic net loss per share since potential common
shares from the conversion of preferred stock, stock options and warrants are
antidilutive. Autobytel evaluated the requirements of the Securities and
Exchange Commission Staff Accounting Bulletin (SAB) No. 98, and concluded that
there are no nominal issuances of common stock or potential common stock which
would be required to be shown as outstanding for all periods as outlined in SAB
No. 98.

New Accounting Pronouncements

     In June 1998, the FASB issued SFAS No. 133, "Accounting for Derivative
Instruments and Hedging Activities," which is effective for fiscal years
beginning after June 15, 2000 (as amended by SFAS No. 137 and 138). SFAS No. 133
establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments.
Autobytel adopted SFAS No. 133 in January 2001.

3. ACQUISITION OF A.I.N. CORPORATION

     On February 15, 2000, Autobytel acquired all of the outstanding stock of
A.I.N. Corporation, the owner of CarSmart, an online buying site for new and
used vehicles, for $3,000 in cash and 1.8 million shares of its common stock
with an agreed upon value of $19,690. The acquisition has been accounted for
using the purchase method of accounting. The purchase price has been allocated
to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed on the basis of their respective
fair values on the acquisition date.

            (AMOUNTS IN THOUSANDS, EXCEPT SHARE AND PER SHARE DATA)

     The excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the assets acquired
and liabilities assumed has been recorded as goodwill in the amount of $25,226
and will be amortized over a 15 year period.

     A.I.N. Corporation's results of operations from the date of acquisition
through December 31, 2000 have been included in the accompanying consolidated
statements of operations.

     The following summarized unaudited pro forma consolidated results of
operation are presented as if the acquisition of A.I.N. Corporation had been
made at the beginning of 1999. The unaudited pro forma results are not
necessarily indicative of future earnings or earnings that would have been
reported had the acquisition been completed as presented.

4. AUTOBYTEL.EUROPE LLC

     Autobytel.Europe LLC (Autobytel.Europe), formerly Auto-By-Tel International
LLC and a wholly owned subsidiary of Autobytel, was incorporated in August 1997
and began operations in the fourth quarter of 1999. Autobytel.Europe was formed
to expand the Autobytel business model and operations throughout Europe.

     In January 2000, Autobytel.Europe and Autobytel entered into an operating
agreement with strategic investors to carryout the expansion plan. In the first
quarter of 2000, a total of $36,700 was invested in Autobytel.Europe. The
investment was comprised of a $31,700 contribution from strategic investors in
exchange for a 22.5% minority interest. Autobytel contributed $5,000, an
exclusive, royalty-free, perpetual license to use or sublicense the "Autobytel"
brand name and proprietary software, and assigned its existing License and
Services Agreements for the United Kingdom, Scandinavia and Finland to
Autobytel.Europe. Autobytel retains a 77.5% controlling interest.

     Autobytel.Europe is considered a start-up company. In accordance with Staff
Accounting Bulletin 51, the difference between Autobytel's carrying amount of
the investment in Autobytel.Europe and the underlying net book value of
Autobytel.Europe immediately after the investment was reflected as a capital
transaction and credited directly to Autobytel's equity.

     Rent expense was $1,202, $756 and $509 for the years ended December 31,
2000, 1999 and 1998, respectively.

Marketing and Advertising Agreements

     In March 2000, Autobytel entered into a three year Internet marketing
agreement with NBCi, a company that operates a search engine. The agreement
permits Autobytel to maintain certain promotional rights and linkage with NBCi,
and provides for certain advertising. The payments under the agreement consist
of an annual fee and a monthly fee. Autobytel expenses the annual fee ratably
over a 12-month period and the monthly fee in the period advertising is
provided. As of December 31, 2000, the minimum future payments under the
agreement amounted to approximately $8,900.

     Autobytel has agreements with other search engines, Internet service and
automotive information providers, including Prodigy, AT&T WorldNet, Edmund's,
Kelley Blue Book and Intellichoice, that make available to consumers vehicle
research data over the Internet. These agreements are generally for a term of
one to four years and require that Autobytel pay a combination of set-up,
initial, annual, monthly and variable fees based on the volume of purchase
requests received by Autobytel. The set-up fees are expensed as incurred, the
initial fees and annual fees are amortized over the period they relate to. The
monthly fees are expensed in the month they relate to and variable fees are
expensed in the period

greater of the base salary plus, in certain cases, bonus that would have been
received by the executive over the remaining term of the agreement or for one to
two years as specified in the applicable agreement, except that Mr. Donchak's
payment is equal to one year base salary. Messrs. Lorimer, Benner and Amir are
also entitled to additional severance payments in the event of termination
within a specified time period of a change of control. The terms of Messrs.
Lorimer, Benner and Amir's agreements range from two to three years with one

agreements may be terminated by Autobytel.Europe upon three months notice.

Litigation

     Autobytel may become subject to legal proceedings from time to time in the
normal course of business. Autobytel is not currently involved in any litigation
that management believes will have a material adverse effect on its financial
position or results of operations.

     A.I.N. Corporation was sued on September 1, 1999 in a lawsuit entitled
Robert Martins v. Michael J. Gorun, A.I.N., Inc., et al., in Los Angeles
Superior Court. The complaint contains causes of action for breach of written
and oral contracts, promissory estoppel, breach of fiduciary duty and fraud, and
seeks damages and equitable relief. The plaintiff contends he is entitled to a
49.9% ownership interest in A.I.N. Corporation's CarSmart online business based
on a purported agreement for the formation of a company called CarSmart On-Line
Services. On December 14, 1999, A.I.N. Corporation filed a complaint for
declaratory relief on the subject of Mr. Martins' lawsuit in Contra Costa County
Superior Court. The Los Angeles action has been transferred to Contra Costa
County and the two cases have been consolidated. Autobytel was added as a cross
defendant in such action. The lawsuit is and will be vigorously contested on
behalf of Autobytel, A.I.N. Corporation and individual co-defendant Michael
Gorun.

     The selling shareholders of A.I.N. Corporation are obligated to fully
indemnify Autobytel for all losses, including attorney's fees, expenses,
settlements and judgements, arising out of the lawsuit. The indemnification
obligation was initially secured by 450,000 shares of Autobytel common stock
transferred to the selling shareholders as part of the acquisition of A.I.N.
Corporation, as well as $250 in cash. As of December 31, 2000, the obligation
was secured by the 450,000 shares of common stock and $95 in cash after
expenses.

     In July 1998, Autobytel and certain of its past and current officers were
sued by a former employee. The plaintiff claimed, among other things, that he

            (AMOUNTS IN THOUSANDS, EXCEPT SHARE AND PER SHARE DATA)

in favor of plaintiff in the amount of $1.9 million was rendered. Autobytel
intends to vigorously contest the judgement.

     From time to time, we are involved in other litigation matters relating to
claims arising out of the ordinary course of business. Autobytel is involved in
at least one such case currently. Management believes that there are no claims
or actions pending or threatened against Autobytel, the ultimate disposition of
which would have a material adverse effect on Autobytel's business, results of
operations and financial condition. However, if a court or jury rules against
Autobytel and the ruling is ultimately sustained on appeal and damages are
awarded against Autobytel that include punitive damages, such ruling could have
a material and adverse effect on Autobytel's business, results of operations and
financial condition.

7. RETIREMENT SAVINGS PLAN

     Autobytel has a retirement savings plan which qualifies as a deferred
salary arrangement under Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code (the 401(k)
Plan.) The 401(k) Plan covers all full time employees of Autobytel who are over
21 years of age and have worked for Autobytel for at least 3 months. Under the
401(k) Plan, participating employees are allowed to defer up to 15% of their
pretax salaries up to a maximum of $10.5 per year. Company contributions to the
401(k) Plan are discretionary. In January 2000, Autobytel began to match
employee contributions 50 cents per dollar up to a maximum of $3 per year in
Autobytel common stock. During 2000, Autobytel matched employee contributions by
contributing $326 or 68,686 shares of common stock at the current fair market
value on the date the shares were issued.

8. STOCKHOLDERS' EQUITY

Initial Public Offering

     In March 1999, Autobytel consummated its initial public offering and issued
3,500,000 shares of common stock at a price of $23 per share. An additional
1,000,000 shares of common stock were offered by selling stockholders at a price
of $23 per share. Autobytel received proceeds of approximately $72,084, net of
underwriting discounts, fees and other initial public offering costs.

     At the closing of the offering, outstanding shares of Series A, Series B
and Series C convertible preferred stock were automatically converted to an
aggregate total of 5,852,290 shares of common stock.

     In addition, the selling stockholders granted the underwriters a 30-day
option to purchase up to an additional 637,500 shares of common stock to cover
over-allotments. The underwriters exercised this option in April 1999.

Preferred Stock

     As of December 31, 2000, 11,445,187 shares of preferred stock with a $0.001
par value were authorized and undesignated.

Warrants

     In November 1998, Autobytel issued a warrant to purchase 150,000 shares of
common stock to Invision AG, an investor in its Series C convertible preferred
stock (Series C Preferred), in exchange for their commitment to assist Autobytel
with organizational and start-up activities related to a Pan-European entity in
which Autobytel may invest with them. The warrant is exercisable at $13.20 per
share and expires in November 2001. The warrant was valued at $270, which was
expensed in 1998, as Invision AG has fulfilled its commitment and has no further
obligation to Autobytel.

             NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)
            (AMOUNTS IN THOUSANDS, EXCEPT SHARE AND PER SHARE DATA)

     In December 1998, Autobytel issued warrants to purchase 289,800 shares of
common stock to Aureus Private Equity AG (Aureus), an investor in its Series C
Preferred, in exchange for their commitment to assist Autobytel with
organizational and start-up activities related to a Pan-European entity in which
Autobytel may invest with them. The warrants are exercisable at $13.20 per share
and expire in December 2001. The warrants were valued at $522, which was
expensed in 1998, as Aureus has fulfilled its commitment and has no further
obligation to Autobytel.

     In December 1998, Autobytel issued a warrant to purchase 300,000 shares of
common stock to MediaOne Interactive Services, Inc. in exchange for the right to
participate in the development of broadband application technology. The warrant
is exercisable at $13.20 per share and expires in December 2001. The warrant was
valued at $540, and was amortized to expense in 1999.

     The fair value of each of these warrants was estimated using the
Black-Scholes option-pricing model and the following assumptions: (1) no
dividend yield, (2) volatility of 0.10%, (3) risk-free interest rate of 4.90%,
and (4) expected life of three years.

9. STOCK OPTION PLANS

1996 Stock Option Plan

     Autobytel's 1996 Stock Option Plan (the Option Plan) was approved by the
board of directors in May 1996. The Option Plan was terminated by a resolution
of the board of directors in October 1996, at which time 870,555 options had
been issued. The Option Plan provided for the granting to employees of incentive
stock options within the meaning of Section 422 of the Internal Revenue Code of
1986, as amended (the Code), and for the granting to employees, consultants and
directors of nonstatutory stock options. Autobytel reserved 1,194,444 shares of
common stock for exercise of stock options under the Option Plan. The exercise
price of incentive stock options granted under the Option Plan could not be
lower than the fair market value of the common stock, and the exercise price of
nonstatutory stock options could not be less than 85% of the fair market value
of the common stock, as determined by the board of directors, on the date of
grant. With respect to any participants who, at the time of grant, owned stock
that possessed more than 10% of the voting power of all classes of stock of
Autobytel, the exercise price of any stock option granted to such person was to
be at least 110% of the fair market value on the grant date, and the maximum
term of such option was five years. The term of all other options granted under
the Option Plan did not exceed 10 years. Stock options granted under the Option
Plan vest according to vesting schedules determined by the board of directors.

1996 Stock Incentive Plan

     Autobytel's 1996 Stock Incentive Plan (the Incentive Plan) was approved by
the board of directors in October 1996, and was amended in November 1996. The
Incentive Plan provides for the granting to employees of incentive stock options
within the meaning of Section 422 of the Code, and for the granting to
employees, directors and consultants of nonstatutory stock options and stock
purchase rights. Autobytel has reserved a total of 833,333 shares of common
stock for issuance under the Incentive Plan. The exercise price of stock options
granted under the Incentive Plan cannot be lower than the fair market value of
the common stock, as determined by the board of directors, on the date of grant.
With respect to any participants who, at the time of grant, own stock possessing
more than 10% of the voting power of all classes of stock of Autobytel, the
exercise price of stock options granted to such person must be at least 110% of
the fair market value on the grant date, and the maximum term of such options is
five years. The term of all other options granted under the Incentive Plan may
be up to 10 years. Stock options granted under the Incentive Plan vest according
to vesting schedules determined by the board of directors.

             NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)
            (AMOUNTS IN THOUSANDS, EXCEPT SHARE AND PER SHARE DATA)

1998 Stock Option Plan

     Autobytel's 1998 Stock Option Plan (the 1998 Option Plan) was adopted in
December 1998 and amended in September 1999. Autobytel has reserved 1,500,000
shares under the 1998 Option Plan. The 1998 Option Plan provides for the
granting to employees of incentive stock options within the meaning of the Code,
and for the granting to employees of nonstatutory stock options.

     The exercise price of non-statutory options granted under the 1998 Option
Plan cannot be lower than 85% of the fair market value of the common stock on
the date of grant. The exercise price of all incentive stock options granted
cannot be lower than the fair market value on the grant date. With respect to
any participants who beneficially own more than 10% of the voting power of all
classes of stock of Autobytel, the exercise price of any stock option granted to
such person must be at least 110% of the fair market value on the grant date,
and the maximum term of such option is five years. The term of all other options
granted under the 1998 Option Plan may be up to 10 years. Under the 1998 Option
Plan, certain nonstatutory stock options (Performance Options) vest over a time
period determined by the board of directors, however, the vesting could be
accelerated based on the performance of Autobytel's common stock.

     In December 1998, the board of directors granted Performance Options to
purchase 700,000 shares of common stock to certain executives at an exercise
price of $13.20 per share, which represents the fair market value on the date of
grant. These options vest over a seven-year period, but the vesting could be
accelerated based on the performance of Autobytel's common stock. The
accelerated vesting schedule provides that the grants will vest in six
installments, one installment vesting each six months over a 3-year period if
pre-established average trading prices of the common stock are achieved. Those
installments will vest if the average trading price exceeds the exercise price
by $6.60, $13.20, $19.80, $26.40, $33.00 and $39.60, respectively, in the
applicable six month period after the date of grant. All other stock options
granted under the 1998 Option Plan vest according to vesting schedules
determined by the board of directors.

     The 1998 Option Plan provides that, unless otherwise provided in the stock
option agreement, in the event of any merger, consolidation, or sale or transfer
of all or any part of Autobytel's business or assets, all rights of the optionee
with respect to the unexercised portion of any option will become immediately
vested and may be exercised immediately, except to the extent that any agreement
or undertaking of any party to any such merger, consolidation, or sale or
transfer of assets makes specific provisions for the assumption of the
obligations of Autobytel with respect to the 1998 Option Plan.

1999 Stock Option Plan

     Autobytel's 1999 Stock Option Plan (the 1999 Option Plan) was adopted in
January 1999 and amended in September 1999. Autobytel has reserved 1,800,000
shares under the 1999 Option Plan. The 1999 Option Plan provides for the
granting of stock options to key employees of Autobytel. Under the 1999 Option
Plan, not more than 1,000,000 shares may be issued pursuant to options granted
after March 31, 1999.

     The 1999 Option Plan provides for an automatic grant of an option to
purchase 20,000 shares of common stock to each non-employee director on the date
on which the person first becomes a non-employee director. In each successive
year the non-employee director will automatically be granted an option to
purchase 5,000 shares on November 1 of each subsequent year provided the
non-employee director has served on the board of directors for at least six
months. Each option will have a term of 10 years and will be granted at the fair
market value of Autobytel's common stock on the date of grant.

             NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)
            (AMOUNTS IN THOUSANDS, EXCEPT SHARE AND PER SHARE DATA)

The options vest in their entirety and become exercisable on the first
anniversary of the grant date, provided that the optionee continues to serve as
a director on such date.

     The 1999 Option Plan is similar in all other material respects to the 1998
Option Plan.

Rescission Offer for Stock Options Granted in Excess of the 1996 Incentive Plan
Limit

     From May 1997 to January 1999, Autobytel issued grants of incentive stock
options in excess of the Incentive Plan limit of 833,333 shares. Subsequent to
December 31, 1998, Autobytel offered to exchange the affected options for a cash
payment or a new grant of incentive stock options under the 1999 Option Plan. In
1999, Autobytel resolved this matter without a material impact on its financial
statements. Total cash payments were less than $10. The new stock options were
granted at the fair market value at the date of the new grant, which equaled the
exercise price of the original options. All other significant provisions
associated with the options remained the same.

1999 Employee and Acquisition Related Stock Option Plan

     Autobytel's 1999 Employee and Acquisition Related Stock Option Plan (the
Employee and Acquisition Option Plan) was approved by the board of directors in
September 1999. Autobytel has reserved a total of 1,500,000 shares of common
stock for issuance under the Employee and Acquisition Option Plan. The Employee
and Acquisition Option Plan provides for the granting to employees and acquired
employees of incentive stock options within the meaning of the Code, and for the
granting to employees, acquired employees and service providers of nonstatutory
stock options. The exercise price of incentive stock options granted can not be
lower than the fair market value on the date of grant and the exercise price of
nonstatutory stock options can not be less than 85% of the fair market value of
the common stock on the date of grant. The exercise price of stock options
granted to individuals beneficially owning more than 10% of the voting power of
all classes of Autobytel stock must be at least 110% of the fair market value on
the grant date and have a maximum term of five years. The term of all other
options granted under the Employee and Acquisition Option Plan may be up to 10
years. Stock options granted under the Employee and Acquisition Option Plan vest
according to vesting schedules determined by the board of directors.

2000 Stock Option Plan

     Autobytel's 2000 Stock Option Plan (the 2000 Option Plan) was approved by
the board of directors in April 2000 and the stockholders at the annual meeting
held on June 15, 2000. The 2000 Option Plan provides for the granting of both
incentive stock options and nonqualified stock options to eligible employees,
consultants and outside directors of Autobytel. Autobytel has reserved three
million shares under the 2000 Option Plan.

     In May 2000, the board of directors granted Performance Options to purchase
250,000 shares of common stock to a certain executive at an exercise price of
$6.19 per share, which represents the fair market value on the date of grant.
These options vest over a five year period, but the vesting could be accelerated
based on the performance of Autobytel's common stock. The accelerated vesting
schedule provides that the grants will vest in five installments, the first
installment on the eight month anniversary of the grant date and the remaining
installments on each subsequent seven month anniversary period, if
pre-established average trading prices of the common stock are achieved. These
installments will vest if the average trading price exceeds $11.00, $16.00,
$21.00, $26.00 and $31.00, respectively, in the applicable period after the date
of grant. All other stock options granted under the 2000 Option Plan vest
according to vesting schedules determined by the board of directors.

STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION

     From January to March 1999, Autobytel granted stock options to purchase
388,236 shares of common stock under the 1999 Stock Option Plan. These stock
options were granted to employees and directors at exercise prices of $13.20 and
$16.00 per share which were below the fair market value at the date of grant. In
relation to these grants, Autobytel will recognize non-cash compensation expense
of approximately $2,600 ratably over the vesting term of one to four years.
Compensation expense of approximately $393 and $1,063 was recognized as
operating expense in 2000 and 1999, respectively.

Pro Forma Disclosure

     Had compensation cost for Autobytel's stock option grants for its
stock-based compensation plans been determined consistent with SFAS No. 123,
Autobytel's net loss and net loss per share for the years ended December 31,
2000, 1999 and 1998 would approximate the pro forma amounts below:

10. STOCK PURCHASE PLAN

1996 Employee Stock Purchase Plan

     Autobytel's 1996 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the Purchase Plan) was
adopted by the board of directors in November 1996. The Purchase Plan, which is
intended to qualify under Section 423 of the Code, permits eligible employees of
Autobytel to purchase shares of common stock through payroll deductions of up to
ten percent of their compensation, up to a certain maximum amount for all
purchase periods ending within any calendar year. Autobytel has reserved a total
of 444,444 shares of common stock for issuance under the Purchase Plan. The
price of common stock purchased under the Purchase Plan will be 85% of the lower
of the fair market value of the common stock on the first or last day of each
six month purchase period. Employees may end their participation in the Purchase
Plan at any time during an

offering period, and they will be paid their payroll deductions to date.
Participation ends automatically upon termination of employment with Autobytel.

     During the years ended December 31, 2000 and 1999, 21,740 and 3,161 shares
of common stock were issued under the Purchase Plan, respectively.

11. INCOME TAXES

     No provision for federal income taxes has been recorded as Autobytel
incurred net operating losses through December 31, 2000. Provision for income
taxes primarily consists of franchise taxes paid to the state of Delaware. As of
December 31, 2000, Autobytel had approximately $76,700 and $38,200 of federal
and state net operating loss carryforwards available to offset future taxable
income. These net operating loss carryforwards expire in various years through
2020. Under the Tax Reform Act of 1986, the amounts of and benefits from
Autobytel's net operating loss carryforwards will be limited under the
provisions of Internal Revenue Code Section 382. Based on estimates, management
believes the effect of such limitation will not have a material adverse effect
on Autobytel.

     Autobytel accounts for income taxes in accordance with SFAS No. 109,
"Accounting for Income Taxes." Under SFAS No. 109, deferred income tax assets
and liabilities are determined based on the differences between the book and tax
basis of assets and liabilities and are measured using the currently enacted tax
rates and laws. Net deferred income tax assets, totaling approximately $35,900
as of December 31, 2000 and $24,700 as of December 31, 1999, consist primarily
of the tax effect of net operating loss carryforwards, reserves and accrued
expenses which are not yet deductible for tax purposes. Autobytel has provided a
full valuation allowance on these deferred income tax assets because of
uncertainty regarding their realization.

12. RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS

Peter R. Ellis

     In March 1998, Autobytel extended to co-founding member and stockholder,
Peter R. Ellis a $250 loan bearing interest at 8% per annum compounded quarterly

secured by Mr. Ellis's stock in Autobytel. Mr. Ellis repaid the loan, including

this agreement are included in operating expenses in the accompanying

1. ORGANIZATION AND OPERATIONS OF AUTOBYTEL

     autobytel.com inc. (Autobytel) is an internationally branded online
automotive commerce company that provides consumers with automotive solutions
throughout the lifecycle of vehicle ownership. Autobytel owns branded Internet
sites for new and pre-owned vehicle information and automotive services that
link buyers and sellers in an information-rich environment. Through its Web
sites (www.autobytel.com and www.carsmart.com), consumers can research pricing,
specifications and other information related to new and pre-owned vehicles and
purchase, finance, lease, insure, sell or maintain their vehicles. When
consumers indicate they are ready to buy a vehicle, they can be connected to
participating dealers in the United States and Canada, or to other sellers
through its classified ads.

     Autobytel has also established international joint ventures and/or
licensing agreements to market new and used vehicles in the United Kingdom,
Sweden, Japan, Australia, The Netherlands and Spain.

     Since its inception in January 1995, Autobytel has invested in marketing
its brand name and developing infrastructure to support anticipated future
operating growth. As a result, Autobytel has experienced significant operating
losses and has an accumulated deficit of $99.7 million as of March 31, 2001.
Management believes current cash and cash equivalents are sufficient to meet
anticipated cash needs for working capital and capital expenditures for at least
the next twelve months.

2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Unaudited Interim Financial Statements

     The accompanying interim consolidated financial statements as of March 31,
2001, and for the three months ended March 31, 2001 and 2000, are unaudited. The
unaudited interim consolidated financial statements have been prepared on the
same basis as the annual consolidated financial statements and, in the opinion
of Autobytel's management, reflect all adjustments, which are of a normal
recurring nature, necessary to present fairly Autobytel's consolidated balance
sheets, statements of operations and cash flows for the periods presented in
accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.
Autobytel's results for an interim period are not necessarily indicative of the
results that may be expected for the year.

     Although Autobytel believes that all adjustments necessary for a fair
presentation of the interim periods presented are included and that the
disclosures are adequate, these consolidated financial statements and notes
thereto are unaudited and should be read in conjunction with the audited
consolidated financial statements and notes thereto for the year ended December
31, 2000 included in Autobytel's Annual Report on Form 10-K, filed with the
Securities and Exchange Commission on March 29, 2001.

Use of Estimates in the Preparation of Financial Statements

     The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and
liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of
the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses
during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

Consulting Revenue

     Autobytel entered into an agreement with GM for consulting services related
to an online locate-to-order vehicle inventory test program which involves
modification of the existing Autobytel.com Web site, project management, dealer
training, demonstrations and debriefings. The agreement commenced in February
2001 and the project is expected to be completed in September 2001.

                                      F-1-25

             NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)
                                  (UNAUDITED)

     Revenues and expenses related to the test program have been accounted for
using the percentage of completion method based upon the achievement of certain
agreed upon milestones specified in the agreement. Consulting fees of $1.4
million are included in revenues for the three months ended March 31, 2001.

Computation of Basic and Diluted Net Loss Per Share

     Net loss per share has been calculated under Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 128, "Earnings per Share." SFAS No. 128 requires
companies to compute earnings per share under two different methods (basic and
diluted). Basic net loss per share is calculated by dividing the net loss by the
weighted average shares of common stock outstanding during the period. For the
three months ended March 31, 2001 and 2000, diluted net loss per share is equal
to basic net loss per share since potential common shares from the conversion of
stock options and warrants are antidilutive. Autobytel evaluated the
requirements of the Securities and Exchange Commission Staff Accounting Bulletin
(SAB) No. 98, and concluded that there are no nominal issuances of common stock
or potential common stock which would be required to be shown as outstanding for
all periods as outlined in SAB No. 98.

New Accounting Pronouncements

     In June 1998, the FASB issued SFAS No. 133, "Accounting for Derivative
Instruments and Hedging Activities," which is effective for fiscal years
beginning after June 15, 2000 (as amended by SFAS No. 137 and 138). SFAS No. 133
establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments.
Autobytel adopted SFAS No. 133 in January 2001 and does not anticipate the
adoption to have a material effect on Autobytel's financial position or results
of operations.

3. ACQUISITION OF A.I.N. CORPORATION

     On February 15, 2000, Autobytel acquired all of the outstanding stock of
A.I.N. Corporation, the owner of CarSmart.com, an online buying site for new and
used vehicles, for $3.0 million in cash and 1.8 million shares of its common
stock with an agreed upon value of $19.7 million. The acquisition has been
accounted for using the purchase method of accounting.

     A.I.N. Corporation's results of operations from the date of acquisition
through March 31, 2001 have been included in the accompanying consolidated
statements of operations.

4. AUTOBYTEL.EUROPE LLC

     Autobytel.Europe is considered a start-up company. In accordance with Staff
Accounting Bulletin No. 51, the difference between the carrying amount of the
investment in Autobytel.Europe and the underlying net book value of
Autobytel.Europe immediately after the investment was reflected as a capital
transaction and credited directly to Autobytel's equity.

     In March 2001, a strategic investor contributed $2.0 million to
Autobytel.Europe in exchange for 2000 units of Autobytel.Europe. Autobytel
retains a 77% controlling interest in Autobytel.Europe.

     Effective January 1, 2001, Autobytel.Europe changed its functional currency
from the U.S. Dollar to the Euro.

5. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES

Litigation

     Autobytel may become subject to legal proceedings from time to time in the
normal course of business. Autobytel is not currently involved in any litigation
that management believes will have a material adverse effect on its financial
position or results of operations.

     A.I.N. Corporation was sued on September 1, 1999 in a lawsuit entitled
Robert Martins v. Michael J. Gorun, A.I.N., Inc., et al., in Los Angeles
Superior Court. The complaint contains causes of action for breach of written
and oral contracts, promissory estoppel, breach of fiduciary duty and fraud, and
seeks damages and equitable relief. The plaintiff contends he is entitled to a
49.9% ownership interest in A.I.N. Corporation's CarSmart online business based
on a purported agreement for the formation of a company called CarSmart On-Line
Services. On December 14, 1999, A.I.N. Corporation filed a complaint for
declaratory relief on the subject of Mr. Martins' lawsuit in Contra Costa County
Superior Court. The Los Angeles action has been transferred to Contra Costa
County and the two cases have been consolidated. Autobytel was added as a cross
defendant in such action. The lawsuit is and will be vigorously contested on
behalf of Autobytel and A.I.N. Corporation.

     The selling shareholders of A.I.N. Corporation are obligated to fully
indemnify Autobytel for all losses, including attorney's fees, expenses,
settlements and judgements, arising out of the lawsuit. The indemnification
obligation was initially secured by 450,000 shares of Autobytel common stock
transferred to the selling shareholders as part of the acquisition of A.I.N.
Corporation, as well as $250,000 in cash. As of March 31, 2001, the obligation
was secured by the 450,000 shares of common stock and approximately $25,000 in
cash after expenses.

     In July 1998, Autobytel and certain of its past and current officers were
sued by a former employee. The plaintiff claimed, among other things, that he
was wrongfully terminated. In December 2000, a verdict in favor of plaintiff in
the amount of $1.9 million was rendered. Autobytel intends to vigorously contest
the judgement.

     From time to time, we are involved in other litigation matters relating to
claims arising out of the ordinary course of business. Autobytel is involved in
at least one such case currently. Management believes that there are no claims
or actions pending or threatened against Autobytel, the ultimate disposition of
which would have a material adverse effect on Autobytel's business, results of
operations and financial condition. However, if a court or jury rules against
Autobytel and the ruling is ultimately sustained on appeal and damages are
awarded against Autobytel, such ruling could have a material and adverse effect
on Autobytel's business, results of operations and financial condition.

6. SUBSEQUENT EVENTS

     In April 2001, Autobytel entered into an agreement to acquire by merger
Autoweb.com, Inc., an automotive Internet service. Autoweb shareholders will
receive 0.3553 shares of Autobytel common stock for each share of Autoweb common
stock. The acquisition, which is subject to approval by both Autobytel and
Autoweb stockholders, as well as satisfaction of other conditions, is expected
to be accounted for using the purchase method of accounting. The acquisition is
expected to be completed in the third quarter of 2001.

                       REPORT OF INDEPENDENT ACCOUNTANTS

To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of Autoweb.com, Inc.

     In our opinion, the accompanying balance sheets and the related statements
of operations, of stockholders' equity (deficit) and of cash flows present
fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Autoweb.com, Inc. at
December 31, 2000 and 1999 and the results of its operations and its cash flows
for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2000 in conformity
with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
These financial statements are the responsibility of Autoweb.com, Inc.'s
management; our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial
statements based on our audits. We conducted our audits of these statements in
accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of
America, which require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable
assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the
accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well
as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our
audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

                         NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

1. THE COMPANY

     Autoweb.com, Inc. (the "Company") was incorporated in California on October
3, 1995 as Downtown Web, Inc. and reincorporated in Delaware on March 16, 1999.
The Company provides a consumer automotive Internet service, whereby its Web
site enables consumers to select new or pre-owned vehicles from member dealers,
and the Company also offers services that enable consumers to purchase
automotive-related products and services such as insurance and financing. The
Company also provides, through its division AIC, automotive and on-line research
tools for automotive manufacturers, major Web portals and other industries. The
Company markets and sells its services primarily in North America and operates
in one business segment.

     The Company sold 5,550,000 shares of common stock at $14.00 per share upon
completing its initial public offering on March 26, 1999 and raised $71.1
million, net of underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses.

     The Company has sustained net losses and negative cash flows from
operations since its inception. The Company's ability to meet its obligations in
the ordinary course of business is dependent on its ability to achieve
profitable operations and/or raise additional financing through public or
private equity financings or other sources of financing to fund operations.
However, there is no assurance that the Company will achieve profitable
operations or that it will be able to raise adequate financing from other
sources. Management believes that its current funds will be sufficient to enable
the Company to meet its planned expenditures through at least December 31, 2001.
If anticipated operating results are not achieved, management has the intent and
it believes that it has the ability to delay or reduce expenditures so as not to
require additional financial resources, if such resources were not available on
terms acceptable to the Company.

2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Use of Estimates

     The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally
accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the
disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial
statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the
reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

Concentrations of Credit Risk

     Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to a
concentration of credit risk consist of cash and cash equivalents, restricted
cash, short-term investments and accounts receivable. Cash, cash equivalents,
restricted cash, and short-term investments are deposited with seven high
quality financial institutions in the United States. The Company maintains
allowances for potential credit losses and such losses have been within
management's expectations. The Company's accounts receivable are derived from
revenues earned primarily from customers located in the United States and the
Company performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers' financial
condition. The Company generally requires no collateral from its customers and
maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts receivable based on the expected
collectibility. There was no customer which represented 10% or more of the net
revenues for the years ended December 31, 2000, 1999 and 1998 or which
represented 10% or more of accounts receivable at December 31, 2000 and 1999.

                   NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)

Fair Value of Financial Instruments

     Carrying amounts of certain of the Company's financial instruments,
including cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash, short-term investments,
accounts receivable, accounts payable and other accrued liabilities, approximate
fair value due to their relatively short maturities.

Cash and Cash Equivalents

     The Company considers all highly liquid investments purchased with original
maturities or remaining maturities at the time of purchase of three months or
less to be cash equivalents. Cash equivalents consist primarily of deposits in
money market funds.

Investments

     The Company considers all investments purchased with an original maturity
or remaining maturities at the balance sheet date of less than twelve months to
be short-term investments. At December 31, 2000, Autoweb had no short- term or
long-term investments. The Company classifies, at the time of acquisition, its
investments into categories in accordance with the provisions of Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards ("SFAS") No. 115, "Accounting for Certain
Investments in Debt and Equity Securities." The Company classifies its
investments as available-for-sale, which are reported at fair market value.
Unrealized gains and losses at December 31, 1999 were not material. Realized
gains and losses, declines in value of securities judged to be other than
temporary, and interest and dividends on all securities are included in interest
and other income.

Property and Equipment

     Property and equipment are stated at cost and are depreciated on a straight
line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets, generally two years.
Maintenance and repairs are charged to expense when incurred. When assets are
sold or retired, the cost and related accumulated depreciation are removed from
the accounts and any resulting gain or loss is included in operations.

Impairment of Long-Lived Assets

     The Company evaluates the recoverability of long-lived assets in accordance
with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 121, "Accounting for the
Impairment of Long-Lived Assets to be Disposed of" ("SFAS No. 121"). SFAS 121
requires recognition of impairment of long-lived assets in the event of the net
book value of such assets exceeds the future undiscounted cash flows
attributable to such assets.

     During 2000, the Company recorded an impairment charge of $3.1 million
related to declines in the value of equity securities in a private company which
was deemed to be other than temporary.

Intangible Assets

     Intangible assets include acquired technology, trade names, assembled
workforce and customer base. Goodwill resulting from acquisitions is recorded
based upon the excess of the purchase price and the net tangible and intangible
assets acquired. The fair value of intangible assets has been determined by an
independent appraiser. Intangible assets are amortized on a straight-line basis
over periods ranging from three to four years.

                   NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)

Revenue Recognition

     Revenues are derived primarily from fees charged to member dealers for each
qualified purchase inquiry provided to them by the Company. The revenue related
to the fee is recognized at the time the qualified purchase inquiry is forwarded
to the member dealer provided that no significant obligations for the Company
remain and collection of the resulting receivable is probable. The Company
establishes a revenue reserve for customers' allowances based on the Company's
historical experience. The Company initially charged member dealers on a
"subscription" model basis, whereby each member dealer paid an initial set-up
fee and/or a flat monthly fee in exchange for receiving qualified purchase
inquiries from the Company. Under the former subscription model, revenue from
both the initial and/or monthly fee was initially deferred and then recognized
ratably over the term of the agreement, generally one year. Revenue from the
former subscription model largely ceased in 1999.

     The Company also derives revenues from the data, tools and services it
provides to automotive manufacturers, major Web portals and other industries.
Revenue is recognized ratably over the period the tools and services are made
available to the customer.

     The Company also derives revenues from the sale of banner advertisements,
which is recognized ratably in the period in which the advertisement is
displayed, provided that no significant obligations for the Company remain and
collection of the resulting receivable is probable. To the extent that minimum
guarantee page deliveries are not met, the Company defers recognition of the
corresponding revenues until the guaranteed page deliveries are achieved. Barter
advertisement transactions are recorded at their estimated fair value based on
the Company's historical experience of selling similar advertising for cash.
Barter revenue represented 0.3%, 2.4% and 5.6% of net revenues for the year
ended December 31, 2000, 1999 and 1998, respectively.

     In December 1999, the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") issued
Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 101 or SAB 101, Revenue Recognition in Financial
Statements, which provides guidance on the recognition, presentation, and
disclosure of revenue in financial statements filed with the Commission. SAB 101
outlines the basic criteria that must be met to recognize revenue and provides
guidance for disclosures related to revenue recognition policies. On March 24,
2000 and June 26, 2000, the SEC issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 101A and
No. 101B, respectively, which extended the transition provisions of SAB 101
until no later than the fourth quarter of fiscal years beginning after December
15, 1999. The Company has reviewed its revenue recognition policies and
determined that it is in compliance with SAB 101.

Product Development Costs

     Product development costs are expensed as incurred. Costs incurred in the
design, creation and maintenance of content, graphics and user interface of the
Company's Web site are expensed as incurred in accordance with SOP 98-1
"Accounting for the Costs of Computer Software Development or Obtained for
Internal Use." Costs incurred in the development of application and
infrastructure of the Web sites are capitalized and amortized over the useful
life of the web sites. In 2000 and 1999, the costs that could be capitalized
were insignificant.

Advertising

     Advertising costs are expensed as incurred and totaled $36.1 million, $20.6
million and $5.8 million during the years ended December 31, 2000, 1999 and
1998, respectively and have been included in sales and marketing expense in the
statements of operations.

Stock-Based Compensation

     In 1997, the company adopted the disclosure provisions of SFAS No. 123,
"Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation." The Company has elected to continue
accounting for stock-based compensation issued to employees using Accounting
Principles Board ("APB") Opinion No. 25, "Accounting for Stock Issued to
Employees." Under APB No. 25, and related interpretations, including Financial
Interpretation No. 44, compensation expense is based on the difference, if any,
on the date of the grant between the fair value of the Company's stock and the
exercise price. Stock issued to non-employees has been accounted for in
accordance with SFAS No. 123 and valued using the Black-Scholes model.

Income Taxes

     The Company accounts for income taxes in accordance with SFAS No. 109,
"Accounting for Income Taxes." This statement prescribes the use of the
liability method whereby deferred tax assets and liability account balances are
calculated at the balance sheet date using current tax laws and rates in effect.
Valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax
assets where it is more likely than not that the deferred tax asset will not be
realized.

Net Loss Per Share

     The Company computes net loss per share in accordance with SFAS No. 128,
"Earnings per Share" and SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin ("SAB") 98. Under the
provision of SFAS No. 128, basic net loss per share is computed by dividing the
net loss attributable to common stockholders for the period by weighted average
number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted net loss per
share is computed by dividing the net loss for the period by the weighted
average number of common and common equivalent shares outstanding during the
period. Common equivalent shares, composed of common shares issuable upon the
exercise of stock options and warrants and upon conversion of Series A, Series
B, Series C and Series D mandatorily redeemable convertible preferred stock, are
included in the diluted net loss per share computation to the extent such shares
are dilutive.

                                                                  YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31,

Business Segments

     In June 1997, the FASB issued SFAS No. 131, "Disclosure about Segments of
an Enterprise and Related Information." SFAS No. 131 requires publicly held
companies to report financial and other information about key revenue segments
of the entity for which such information is available and is utilized by the
chief operation decision maker. SFAS No. 131 is effective for the fiscal years
commencing December 15, 1997. The Company conducts its business within one
business segment within North America. Revenues from customers outside of the
United States were less than 10% of net revenues for all periods represented in
the accompanying statements of operations.

Comprehensive Income

     Effective January 1, 1998, the Company adopted the provisions of SFAS No.
130, "Reporting Comprehensive Income." SFAS No. 130 requires companies to
classify items of other comprehensive income and its components in financial
statements and display the accumulated balance of other comprehensive income
separately from retained earnings in the equity section of a statement of
financial position. The Company's total comprehensive loss was the same as its
net loss for the years ended December 31, 2000, 1999, and 1998.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements

     In June 1998, the FASB issued SFAS No. 133, "Accounting for Derivative
Instruments and Hedging Activities." SFAS No. 133 is effective for all fiscal
quarters of all years beginning after June 15, 1999. SFAS No. 133 requires that
all derivative instruments be recorded on the balance sheet at fair market
value. Changes in the fair value of derivatives are recorded each period in the
current earnings or other comprehensive income, depending on whether a
derivative is designed as part of a hedge transaction and, if it is, the type of
hedge transaction. In June 1999, the FASB issued SFAS No. 137, which delayed the
effective date of SFAS No. 133 to fiscal years beginning after June 15, 2000.
The adoption of SFAS No. 133 did not have a material impact on our financial
statements.

3. RESTRICTED CASH

     At December 31, 1999, the Company had $2.6 million on deposit with a bank
that was held as collateral for a letter of credit with a vendor. There was no
restricted cash at December 31, 2000.

                   NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)

Marketing Agreements

     During 2000, the Company had agreements with three global Internet media
companies to maintain certain exclusive promotional rights and linkage with the
media companies and to receive certain advertising. In addition, the Company
shares in certain advertising revenues earned by the media companies. At
December 31, 2000, one of these agreements was no longer in effect. Another of
those agreements had been entered into on March 26, 2000 and on April 18, 2000
the related party had finalized its purchase of newly-issued unregistered shares
of common stock from the Company for approximately $21.9 million, resulting in
the ownership of approximately 10% of the Company's outstanding common stock.
The related party has registration rights with respect to those shares. The
March 2000 agreement committed the Company to the following payments for
services to be provided by the shareholder: year ending 2000 -- $9.7 million, of
which $7.2 million was expensed in 2000 and included in advertising expense;
2001 -- $10.0 million; 2002 -- $10.0 million; 2003 -- $2.5 million. In addition,
the Company participated in certain advertising revenue earned by the related
party shareholder which, in 2000, totaled approximately $1.0 million. On March
21, 2001 the agreement was terminated and the Company made a final payment of
$13.3 million to the shareholder in settlement of its then outstanding
commitments; no specific services were received for that payment. Such amount
will be charged to results in the first quarter of 2001. The Company will
continue to receive certain content and customer referrals from the related
party shareholder and will participate in certain advertising revenue earned by
the related party shareholder. Also, on April 2, 2001, the Company entered into
an amendment of the agreement with the remaining global Internet media company
which provides for a reduction in the advertising received in consideration for
reduced payments.

     The future remaining payments under the agreement were reduced from $6.7
million, $8.8 million and $6.7 million as compared to the payments under the
amended arrangement of $3.8 million, $5.1 million and $3.8 million, for the
remainder of 2001, 2002 and 2003, respectively.

     The Company also has multi-year agreements with other Internet advertisers
and automotive information providers that make available to consumers vehicle
research data over the Internet. Such agreements require that the Company pay
fees to these companies based on the volume of referrals received by the Company

Litigation

     From time to time, the Company may be involved in litigation arising out of
claims in the normal course of business. Based upon the information presently
available, including discussion with outside legal counsel, management believes
that there are no claims or actions pending or threatened against the Company,
the ultimate resolution of which will have a material adverse effect on the
Company's financial position, liquidity or results of operations.

7. MANDATORILY REDEEMABLE CONVERTIBLE PREFERRED STOCK

     All mandatorily redeemable convertible preferred stock was converted into
common stock in March 1999 immediately prior to the Company's initial public
offering.

     In December 1998, the company granted an option to the Chairman to purchase
up to 395,661 shares of the Company's Series D mandatorily redeemable
convertible preferred stock at $2.37 per share. The fair value of the option
grant was estimated to be $1.7 million using the intrinsic value method, and was
included in the stock-based compensation charge in the year ended December 31,
1998. In January 1999, the option was exercised for 395,661 shares of Series D
mandatorily redeemable convertible preferred stock in exchange for $252,000 in
cash together with an interest-free full recourse promissory note in the amount

of $686,000 from the Chairman collateralized by the stock. The note is due and
payable on the third anniversary of date of issuance of the stock. These shares
of Series D mandatorily redeemable convertible preferred stock subsequently
converted into 395,661 shares of common stock immediately prior to the Company's
initial public offering in March 1999.

8. COMMON STOCK

     The Company's Certificate of Incorporation, as amended, authorizes the
Company to issue 60,000,000 shares of common stock. Each share of common stock
has the right to one vote. The holders of common stock are also entitled to
receive dividends whenever funds are legally available and when declared by the
board of directors, subject to the prior rights of all classes of stock at the
time outstanding having priority rights as to dividends.

9. EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS

401(k) Savings Plan

     The Company has a savings plan (the "Savings Plan") that qualifies as a
deferred salary arrangement under Section 401 (k) of the Internal Revenue Code.
Under the Savings Plan, participating employees may defer a percentage (not to
exceed 25%) of their eligible pretax earnings up to the Internal Revenue
Service's annual contribution limit. All employees of the Company are eligible
to participate in the Savings Plan. The Company is not required to contribute to
the Savings Plan and has made no contribution since the inception of the Savings
Plan.

Employee Stock Purchase Plan

     In 1999, the Company's board of directors adopted and the stockholders
approved the 1999 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the "Purchase Plan") and
reserved a total of 400,000 shares of common stock for issuance thereunder in
addition to an automatic increase on January 1st of each year by an amount equal
to 1% of the shares of common stock outstanding on the immediately preceding
December 31. On January 1, 2000 and January 1, 2001, the automatic increases in
the shares reserved were 255,840 and 295,268, respectively. In 2000, the
Company's board of directors approved an additional 255,840 shares of common
stock to be reserved and available under the Employee Stock Purchase Plan. Under
the Purchase Plan, eligible employees will be permitted to acquire shares of the
Company's common stock through payroll deductions (not to exceed 15%). The
purchase price for the Company's common stock purchased under the Purchase Plan
is 85% of the lesser of the fair market value of the Company's common stock on
the first day or the last day of the purchase period. All employees of the
Company are eligible to participate in the Purchase Plan.

1997 STOCK OPTION PLAN

     In April 1997, the Company's board of directors adopted the 1997 Stock
Option Plan ("1997 Plan"). The 1997 Plan provides for the granting of stock
options to employees and consultants of the Company (including officers and
directors who are also employees.)

     Options under the 1997 Plan may be granted for periods of up to ten years
and at prices no less than 85% of the estimated fair value of the shares on the
date of the grant as determined by the board of directors, provided, however,
that (i) the exercise price of an Incentive Stock Option ("ISO") may not be less
than 100% of the estimated fair value of the shares on the date of the grant,
and (ii) the exercise prices of an ISO granted to a 10% stockholder may not be
less than 110% of the estimated fair value of the shares on the date of grant.
Options are exercisable immediately, subject to repurchase rights held by the
Company that generally lapse over a period of four years.

1999 Equity Incentive Plan

     In 1999, the Company's Board of Directors adopted and the stockholders
approved the 1999 Equity Incentive Plan (the "Equity Plan") and reserved a total
of 2,800,000 shares of common stock for issuance thereunder. These shares are in
addition to shares under the 1997 Plan not issued. The Equity Plan provides for
the grant of both "ISOs" and nonqualified stock options ("NQSOs"). ISOs may be
granted only to employees of the Company and NQSOs may be granted to employees
and consultants of the Company (including officers and directors).

     Options under the Equity Plan may be granted for periods of up to ten years
and at prices no less than 85% of the estimated fair value of the shares on the
date of the grant as determined by the Board of Directors, provided, however,
that (i) the exercise price of an ISO may not be less than 100% of the estimated
fair value of the shares on the date of the grant, and (ii) the exercise price
of an ISO granted to a 10% stockholder may not be less than 110% of the
estimated fair value of the shares on the date of grant. The exercise price of
NQSOs must be at least equal to 85% of the fair market value of the Company's
common stock on the date of grant. Options may be exercisable only as they vest
and the vesting period is generally four years.

     The following summarizes activity under the 1997 Stock Option Plan and the
1999 Equity Incentive Plan (together "the Plans") for the years ended December

     In 1999, the Board approved the Employee Stock Purchase Plan ("ESPP") and
reserved 400,000 shares of common stock. Under the plan, employees are granted
the right to purchase shares of common stock at a price per share that is 85% of
the lessor of the fair market value at the beginning of the offering period or
the end of the offering period. In 2000, 156,986 shares were issued at an
average price of $3.47 per share. For pro forma purposes, had compensation cost
for the ESPP been determined based on fair value at the issue date consistent
with the provisions of SFAS 123, the Company's net loss and net loss per share
for 2000 would have been $38.5 million and $1.36 respectively.

Unearned Stock-Based Compensation

     In connection with certain stock option grants during the years ended
December 31, 1999, and 1998, the Company recorded unearned stock-based
compensation totalling $3.8 million and $11.0 million, respectively, which is
being amortized over the vesting periods of the related options which is
generally four years. In the year ended December 31, 2000 the Company reversed
$2.9 million of unearned stock-based compensation for options which were
cancelled. Amortization of this stock-based compensation recognized during the
years ended December 31, 2000, 1999 and 1998 totalled approximately $1.6
million, $2.2 million and $5.6 million, respectively. The 1998 amortization
reflects accelerated vesting associated with approximately 1.4 million options
of common stock granted to the Chairman and the immediate vesting of the option
for 395,661 shares of Series D mandatorily redeemable convertible preferred
stock granted to the Chairman (Note 7).

     Stock-based compensation expense has been reclassified to the relevant
functional expense categories in the years ended December 31, 1999 and 1998 to
conform with the presentation for the year ended December 31, 2000. The
reclassification has no impact on the previously reported operating loss or net
loss.

                    NOTES TO CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

NOTE 1 -- THE COMPANY

     Autoweb.com, Inc. (the "Company") was incorporated in California on October
3, 1995 as Downtown Web, Inc. and reincorporated in Delaware on March 16, 1999.
The Company provides a consumer automotive Internet service, whereby its Web
site enables consumers to select new or pre-owned vehicles from member dealers,
and the Company also offers services that enable consumers to purchase
automotive-related products and services such as insurance and financing. The
Company also provides, through its division AIC, automotive and on-line research
tools for automotive manufacturers, major web portals and other industries. The
Company markets and sells it's services primarily in North America and operates
in one business segment.

     The Company has sustained net losses and negative cash flows from
operations since its inception. The Company's ability to meet its obligations in
the ordinary course of business is dependent on its ability to achieve
profitable operations and/or raise additional financing through public or
private equity financings or other sources of financing to fund operations.
However, there is no assurance that the Company will achieve profitable
operations or that it will be able to raise adequate financing from other
sources. Management believes that its current funds will be sufficient to enable
the Company to meet its planned expenditures through at least December 31, 2001.
If anticipated operating results are not achieved, management has the intent and
it believes that it has the ability to delay or reduce expenditures so as not to

terms acceptable to the Company.

NOTE 2 -- SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

BASIS OF PREPARATION

     The accompanying condensed financial statements as of March 31, 2001, and
for the three months ended March 31, 2001 and 2000, are unaudited. These
unaudited interim condensed financial statements have been prepared on the same
basis as the annual financial statements and, in the opinion of management,
reflect all adjustments, which include only normal recurring adjustments,
necessary to present fairly the Company's financial position, results of
operations and cash flows as of March 31, 2001 and for the three months ended
March 31, 2001 and 2000. These unaudited interim condensed financial statements
and notes thereto should be read in conjunction with the Company's financial
statements included in the Company's 2000 10-K/A filed with the Securities and
Exchange Commission on April 30, 2001. The results for the three months ended
March 31, 2001 are not necessarily indicative of the expected results for the
year ending December 31, 2001 or any other future period.

CONCENTRATION OF CREDIT RISK

     Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to a
concentration of credit risk consist of cash and cash equivalents and accounts
receivable. Cash and cash equivalents are deposited with six high credit quality
financial institutions in the United States. The Company maintains allowances
for potential credit losses, and such losses have been within management's
expectation. The Company's accounts receivable are derived from revenues earned
primarily from customers located in the United States and the Company performs
ongoing credit evaluations of its customers' financial condition.

FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

     Carrying amounts of certain of the Company's financial instruments,
including cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable and
other accrued liabilities, approximate fair value due to their relatively short
maturities.

             NOTES TO CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- (CONTINUED)

CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS

     The Company considers all highly liquid investments purchased with original
maturities or remaining maturities at the time of purchase of ninety days or
less to be cash equivalents. Cash equivalents consist primarily of deposits in
money market funds.

STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION

     In 1997, the Company adopted the disclosure provisions of Financial
Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
("SFAS") No. 123, "Accounting for Stock-based Compensation." The Company has
elected to continue accounting for stock-based compensation issued to employees
using Accounting Principles Board ("APB") Opinion No. 25, "Accounting for Stock
Issued to Employees." Under APB No. 25, compensation expense is based on the
difference, if any, on the date of the grant between the fair value of the
Company's stock and the exercise price. Stock issued to non-employees has been
accounted for in accordance with SFAS No. 123 and valued using the Black-
Scholes option pricing model.

NET LOSS PER SHARE

     The Company computes net loss per share in accordance with SFAS No. 128,
"Earning per Share" and SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin ("SAB") 98. Under the
provisions of SFAS No. 128, basic net loss per share is computed by dividing the
net loss available to common stockholders for the period by the weighted average
number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted net loss per
share is computed by dividing the net loss for the period by the weighted
average number of common and common equivalent shares outstanding during the
period. Common equivalent shares, composed of common shares issuable upon the
exercise of stock options are included in the diluted net loss per share
computation to the extent such shares are dilutive.

RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS

     In June 1998, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued SFAS No. 133,
"Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities." SFAS No. 133, as
amended, is effective for all fiscal quarters of all years beginning after June
15, 2000. SFAS No. 133 requires companies to record derivatives on the balance
sheet as assets or liabilities, measured at fair market value. Under SFAS No.
133, gains or losses resulting from changes in the values of derivatives are to
be reported in the statement of operations or as a deferred item, depending on
the use of the derivatives and whether they qualify for hedge accounting. The
Company is required to adopt SFAS No. 133 in the first quarter of 2001. To date,
the Company has not engaged in any hedging activity and adoption of this new
standard has not had a significant impact on the Company.

NOTE 4 -- RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS

     At March 31, 2001, the Company had full recourse promissory notes
receivable in the amount of approximately $960,000, approximately $922,000 of
which is from Dean DeBiase, our Chairman and approximately $38,000 of which is
from Samuel Hedgpeth, our former President and Chief Executive Officer. Of this
amount, approximately $174,000 is included in "prepaid expenses and other
current assets" and approximately $786,000 is included in stockholders' equity
as "notes receivable from stockholders." Notes receivable totaling approximately
$922,000 are interest free and collateralized by 595,660 shares of common stock
and the remaining note receivable for approximately $38,000 bears interest at a
rate of 5.59% per annum and is collateralized by 177,012 shares of common stock.

NOTE 5 -- COMMITMENTS

     Through March 31, 2000, the Company had agreements with two global Internet
media companies to maintain certain exclusive promotional rights and linkage
with the media companies and to receive certain advertising. In addition, the
Company shares in certain advertising revenues earned by the media companies.
One of the agreements had been entered into on March 26, 2000 and on April 18,
2000 the related party had finalized its purchase of newly-issued unregistered
shares of common stock from the Company for approximately $21.9 million,
resulting in the ownership of approximately 10% of the Company's outstanding
common stock. The related party has registration rights with respect to those
shares. The March 2000 agreement committed the Company to the following payments
for services to be provided by the shareholder: 2001 -- $10.0 million;
2002 -- $10.0 million; 2003 -- $2.5 million. In addition, the Company
participated in certain advertising revenue earned by the related party
shareholder. On March 21, 2001 the agreement was terminated and the Company made
a final payment of $13.3 million to the shareholder in settlement of its then
outstanding commitments; no specific services were received for that payment.
The Company will continue to receive certain content and customer referrals from
the related party shareholder and will participate in certain advertising
revenue earned by the related party shareholder. Also, on April 2, 2001, the
Company entered into an amendment of the agreement with the remaining global
Internet media company which provides for a reduction in the advertising
received in consideration for reduced payments.

     The future remaining payments under the amended agreement were reduced from
$6.7 million, $8.8 million and $6.7 million as compared to the payments under
the amended arrangement of $3.8 million, $5.1 million and $3.8 million, for the
remainder of 2001, 2002 and 2003, respectively.

     The Company also has multi-year agreements with other Internet advertisers
and automotive information providers that make available to consumers vehicle
research data over the Internet. Such agreements require that the Company pay
fees to these companies based on the volume of referrals

received by the Company from these services. The Company expenses these amounts
as the services are provided.

NOTE 6 -- SUBSEQUENT EVENTS (UNAUDITED)

     On April 11, 2001, Autoweb entered into a definitive acquisition agreement
with Autobytel. Under the terms of the agreement, Autoweb stockholders will
receive 0.3553 shares of Autobytel common stock in exchange for each share of
Autoweb common stock. Outstanding stock options to purchase shares of Autoweb
common stock will be assumed after adjustment at the same exchange ratio.

                                    RECITALS

     A.  The Board of Directors of Autoweb (i) has determined that the Merger

     D.  The parties intend, by executing this Agreement, to adopt a plan of

     NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the representations, warranties,
covenants and agreements set forth herein, and for other good and valuable
consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, the
parties agree as follows:

                                   ARTICLE I.

                                   THE MERGER

     1.1  The Merger. At the Effective Time (as defined below) and subject to
and upon the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the Certificate of Merger
attached hereto as Exhibit B (the "Certificate of Merger") and the applicable
provisions of the Delaware General Corporation Law ("Delaware Law"), Merger Sub
shall be merged with and into Autoweb (the "Merger"), the separate corporate
existence of Merger Sub shall cease and Autoweb shall continue as the surviving
corporation and a subsidiary of Autobytel. Autoweb as the surviving corporation
after the Merger is hereinafter sometimes referred to as the "Surviving
Corporation."

     1.2  Closing; Effective Time. The closing of the transactions contemplated
hereby (the "Closing") shall take place as soon as practicable after the
satisfaction or waiver of each of the conditions set forth in Article VI hereof
or at such other time as the parties hereto agree (the "Closing Date"). The
Closing shall take place at the offices of Paul, Hastings, Janofsky & Walker
LLP, Seventeenth Floor, 695 Town Center Drive, Costa Mesa, California 92626, or
at such other location as the parties hereto agree. In connection with the
Closing, the parties hereto shall cause the Merger to be consummated by filing
the Certificate of Merger with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware,
in accordance with the relevant provisions of Delaware Law (the time of such
filing being the "Effective Time").

     1.3  Effect of the Merger. At the Effective Time, the effect of the Merger
shall be as provided in this Agreement, the Certificate of Merger and the
applicable provisions of Delaware Law. Without limiting the
                                       A-1

generality of the foregoing, and subject thereto, at the Effective Time, all the
property, rights, privileges, powers and franchises of Autoweb and Merger Sub
shall vest in the Surviving Corporation, and all debts, liabilities and duties
of Autoweb and Merger Sub shall become the debts, liabilities and duties of the
Surviving Corporation.

     1.4  Certificate of Incorporation; Bylaws.

     (a) Certificate of Incorporation. At the Effective Time, the certificate of
incorporation of Autoweb shall be amended and restated in its entirety to be
identical to the certificate of incorporation of Merger Sub, as in effect
immediately prior to the Effective Time, which shall be the certificate of
incorporation of the Surviving Corporation until thereafter amended as provided
by Delaware Law and such certificate of incorporation, except that Article I of
the certificate of incorporation shall be amended to read as follows: The name
of this corporation is Autoweb.com, Inc.

     (b) Bylaws. The bylaws of Merger Sub, as in effect immediately prior to the
Effective Time, shall be the bylaws of the Surviving Corporation until
thereafter amended.

     1.5  Directors and Officers. At the Effective Time, the initial directors
of the Surviving Corporation shall be the directors of Merger Sub, each to hold
office until their respective successors are duly elected or appointed and
qualified. The initial officers of the Surviving Corporation shall be the
officers of Merger Sub until their respective successors are duly elected or
appointed and qualified.

     1.6  Effect on Capital Stock. By virtue of the Merger and without any
action on the part of Merger Sub, Autoweb or the holders of any of the following
securities:

          (a) Conversion of Autoweb Common Stock. At the Effective Time, each
     share of Autoweb common stock, $.001 par value ("Autoweb Common Stock")
     issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time other than
     the Dissenting Shares (if applicable) and other than any shares of Autoweb
     Common Stock to be canceled pursuant to Section 1.6(b) will be canceled and
     extinguished and be converted automatically into the right to receive
     0.3553 shares of Autobytel Common Stock (the "Merger Consideration").

          (b) Cancellation of Autoweb Common Stock Owned by Autobytel or
     Autoweb. At the Effective Time, all shares of Autoweb Common Stock that are
     owned by Autobytel or any direct or indirect wholly owned subsidiary of
     Autobytel or of Autoweb immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be
     canceled and extinguished without any conversion thereof.

          (c) Autoweb Stock Option Plans. At the Effective Time, all of the
     outstanding options to purchase Autoweb Common Stock (the "Autoweb
     Options") issued pursuant to Autoweb's 1997 Stock Option Plan, 1999 Equity
     Incentive Plan, 1999 Employee Stock Purchase Plan and 1999 Directors Stock
     Option Plan (the "Autoweb Option Plans") all of which options are listed in
     Section 5.12 of the Autoweb Disclosure Schedule (the "Assumed Options")
     shall be assumed by Autobytel. Autobytel shall assume only the Assumed
     Options. Each Assumed Option shall continue to have, and be subject to, the
     same terms and conditions set forth in the applicable Autoweb Option Plan
     and the applicable stock option agreements in effect on the date of this
     Agreement, except that (i) such options will be exercisable for that number
     of whole shares of Autobytel Common Stock equal to the product of the
     number of shares of Autoweb Common Stock that were issuable upon exercise
     of such option (assuming acceleration of vesting) multiplied by the number
     of shares of Autobytel Common Stock issued in exchange for one share of
     Autoweb Common Stock (the "Exchange Ratio") and, in the case of fractional
     shares, such number shall be rounded down to the nearest whole share of
     Autobytel Common Stock, and (ii) the per share exercise price for the
     shares of Autobytel Common Stock issuable upon exercise of the Assumed
     Option will be equal to the quotient determined by dividing the exercise
     price per share of Autoweb Common Stock at which such Assumed Option was
     exercisable immediately prior to the Effective Time by the Exchange Ratio,
     rounded up to the nearest whole cent.

          (d) Capital Stock of Merger Sub. At the Effective Time, each share of
     Common Stock, $.001 par value, of Merger Sub ("Merger Sub Common Stock")
     issued and outstanding immediately prior to the

                                       A-2

     Effective Time shall be converted into and exchanged for one validly
     issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of Common Stock, $.001 par
     value, of the Surviving Corporation, and the Surviving Corporation shall be
     a wholly-owned subsidiary of Autobytel. Each stock certificate of Merger
     Sub evidencing ownership of any such shares shall continue to evidence
     ownership of such shares of capital stock of the Surviving Corporation.

          (e) Adjustments to Exchange Ratio. The Exchange Ratio shall be
     adjusted to reflect fully the effect of any stock split, reverse split,
     stock dividend (including any dividend or distribution of securities
     convertible into Autobytel Common Stock or Autoweb Common Stock),
     reorganization, recapitalization or other like change with respect to
     Autobytel Common Stock or Autoweb Common Stock occurring on or after the
     date hereof and prior to the Effective Time.

          (f) Dissenting Shares. Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement
     to the contrary, if the stockholders of Autoweb are entitled to appraisal
     rights under Delaware Law, then shares of the Autoweb Common Stock with
     respect to which appraisal rights have been demanded and perfected in
     accordance with Section 262(d) of Delaware Law (the "Dissenting Shares")
     shall not be converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration
     at or after the Effective Time, and the holder thereof shall be entitled
     only to such rights as are granted by Delaware Law. Notwithstanding the
     preceding sentence, if any holder of shares of the Autoweb Common Stock who
     demands appraisal of such shares under Delaware Law shall effectively
     withdraw his demand for such appraisal (in accordance with Section 262(k)
     of Delaware Law) or becomes ineligible for such appraisal (through failure
     to perfect or otherwise) then, as of the Effective Time or the occurrence
     of such event, whichever is the last to occur, such holder's Dissenting
     Shares shall cease to be Dissenting Shares and shall be converted into and
     represent the right to receive the Merger Consideration as provided in this
     Section 1.6. Autoweb shall give Autobytel (i) prompt notice of any written
     demands for appraisal, withdrawals of demands for appraisal and any other
     instrument served pursuant to Section 262 of Delaware Law received by
     Autoweb and (ii) the opportunity to participate in all negotiations and
     proceedings with respect to demands for appraisal under such Section.

          (g) Fractional Shares. No fraction of a share of Autobytel Common
     Stock will be issued, but in lieu thereof each holder of shares of Autoweb
     Common Stock who would otherwise be entitled to a fraction of a share of
     Autobytel Common Stock shall receive an amount of cash (rounded to the
     nearest whole cent) equal to the product of (i) such fraction multiplied by
     (ii) the average closing price of Autobytel common stock for fifteen
     trading days immediately preceding the closing date of the proposed merger,
     as reported on the Nasdaq National Market. The number of shares of
     Autobytel Common Stock awardable hereunder (after aggregating all
     fractional shares of Autobytel Common Stock resulting from the application
     of the Exchange Ratio) shall be rounded down to the nearest whole share of
     Autobytel Common Stock.

     1.7  Surrender of Certificates.

     (a) Exchange Agent. U.S. Stock Transfer Corporation, or such other company
as shall be designated by Autobytel if U.S. Stock Transfer Corporation is unable
or unwilling to serve, shall act as exchange agent (the "Exchange Agent") in the
Merger.

     (b) Autobytel to Provide Common Stock and Cash. Promptly after the
Effective Time, Autobytel shall make available to the Exchange Agent for
exchange in accordance with this Article I (i) the shares of Autobytel Common
Stock issuable pursuant to Section 1.6(a) in exchange for shares of Autoweb
Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, (ii) cash in
an amount sufficient to permit payment of cash in lieu of fractional shares
pursuant to Section 1.6(g) and (iii) any dividends or distributions to which
holders of shares of Autoweb may be entitled pursuant to Section 1.7(d).

     (c) Exchange Procedures. Promptly after the Effective Time, the Surviving
Corporation shall cause to be mailed to each holder of record (immediately prior
to the Effective Time) of a certificate or certificates (the "Certificates")
which immediately prior to the Effective Time represented outstanding shares of
Autoweb Common Stock, whose shares were converted into the right to receive
shares of Autobytel Common

                                       A-3

Stock, cash in lieu of fractional shares and dividends or distributions,
pursuant to Section 1.6(a), 1.6(g) and 1.7(d), respectively, (i) a letter of
transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of
loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon receipt of the
Certificates by the Exchange Agent, and shall be in such form and have such
other provisions as Autobytel may reasonably specify) and (ii) instructions for
use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates in exchange for certificates
representing shares of Autobytel Common Stock, cash in lieu of fractional shares
and dividends or distributions, pursuant to Section 1.6(a), 1.6(g) and 1.7(d),
respectively. Upon surrender of a Certificate for cancellation to the Exchange
Agent or to such other agent or agents as may be appointed by Autobytel,
together with such letter of transmittal, duly completed and validly executed in
accordance with the instructions thereto, the holder of such Certificate shall
be entitled to receive in exchange therefor a certificate representing the
number of whole shares of Autobytel Common Stock which such holder has the right
to receive pursuant to Section 1.6, payment in lieu of fractional shares
pursuant to Section 1.6(g) and any dividends or distributions payable pursuant
to Section 1.7(d), and the Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be
canceled. Until so surrendered, each outstanding Certificate that, prior to the
Effective Time, represented shares of Autoweb Common Stock will be deemed from
and after the Effective Time, for all corporate purposes, other than the payment
of dividends, to evidence the ownership of the number of full shares of
Autobytel Common Stock into which such shares of Autoweb Common Stock shall have
been so converted and the right to receive an amount in cash in lieu of the
issuance of any fractional shares in accordance with Section 1.6(g).

     (d) Distributions With Respect to Unexchanged Shares. No dividends or other
distributions with respect to Autobytel Common Stock with a record date after
the Effective Time will be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered Certificate
with respect to the shares of Autobytel Common Stock represented thereby until
the holder of record of such Certificate shall surrender such Certificate in
accordance with this Section 1.7. Subject to applicable law, following surrender
of any such Certificate, the Exchange Agent shall deliver to the record holder
of the certificates representing whole shares of Autobytel Common Stock issued
in exchange therefor, without interest, at the time of such surrender, the
amount of any such dividends or other distributions with a record date after the
Effective Time theretofore payable (but for the provisions of this Section
1.7(d)) with respect to such shares of Autobytel Common Stock.

     (e) Transfers of Ownership. If any certificate representing shares of
Autobytel Common Stock is to be issued in a name other than that in which the
Certificate surrendered in exchange therefor is registered, it will be a
condition of the issuance thereof that the Certificate so surrendered will be
properly endorsed and otherwise in proper form for transfer and that the Person
requesting such exchange will have paid to Autobytel or any agent designated by
it any transfer tax or other taxes required by reason of the issuance of a
certificate for shares of Autobytel Common Stock in any name other than that of
the registered holder of the Certificate surrendered, or established to the
satisfaction of Autobytel or any agent designated by it that any such taxes have
been paid or are not payable. For purposes of this Agreement, "Person" shall
mean any individual, corporation, limited liability company, partnership, joint
venture, association, trust, unincorporated organization or other entity.

     (f) No Liability. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section
1.7, none of the Exchange Agent, the Surviving Corporation or any party hereto
shall be liable to any Person for any amount properly paid to a public official
pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar law.

     1.8  No Further Ownership Rights in Autoweb Common Stock. All shares of
Autobytel Common Stock issued upon the surrender for exchange of shares of
Autoweb Common Stock in accordance with the terms hereof (including any cash
paid in lieu of fractional shares and any dividends or distributions) shall be
deemed to have been issued in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such
shares of Autoweb Common Stock, and there shall be no further registration of
transfers on the records of the Surviving Corporation of shares of Autoweb
Common Stock which were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If,
after the Effective Time, Certificates are presented to the Surviving
Corporation for any reason, they shall be canceled and exchanged as provided in
this Article I.

     1.9  Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates. In the event any Certificates
shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, the Exchange Agent shall issue in
exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificates, upon the

                                       A-4

making of an affidavit of that fact by the holder thereof, such shares of
Autobytel Common Stock (and cash in lieu of fractional shares and any dividends
or distributions) as may be required pursuant to Section 1.6; provided, however,
that Autobytel may, in its discretion and as a condition precedent to the
issuance thereof, require the owner of such lost, stolen or destroyed
Certificates to deliver a bond in such sum as it may reasonably direct as
indemnity against any claim that may be made against Autobytel, the Surviving
Corporation or the Exchange Agent with respect to the Certificates alleged to
have been lost, stolen or destroyed.

     1.10  Tax Consequences. It is intended by the parties hereto that the
Merger shall constitute a reorganization within the meaning of Section 368 of
the Code. It is intended by the parties hereto that the Merger shall be treated
for accounting purposes as a "purchase."

     1.11  Taking of Necessary Action; Further Action. If, at any time after the
Effective Time, any further action is necessary or desirable to carry out the
purposes of this Agreement and to vest the Surviving Corporation with full
right, title and possession to all assets, property, rights, privileges, powers
and franchises of Autoweb and Merger Sub, the officers and directors of Autoweb
and Merger Sub are fully authorized in the name of their respective corporations
or otherwise to take, and will take, all such lawful and necessary action, so
long as such action is not inconsistent with this Agreement.

                                  ARTICLE II.

                   REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF AUTOWEB

     In this Agreement, any reference to any event, change, condition or effect
being "material" with respect to any Person means any material event, change,
condition or effect related to the condition (financial or otherwise),
properties, assets (including intangible assets), liabilities, business,
operations or results of operations of such Person and its subsidiaries, taken
as a whole. In this Agreement, any reference to a "Material Adverse Effect" with
respect to any Person means any effect that individually or taken together with
other effects is materially adverse to (i) the condition (financial or
otherwise), properties, assets, liabilities, business, operations or results of
operations of such Person and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole or (ii) the
ability of such Person to consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement; provided, however, that no Material Adverse Effect shall be deemed to
have occurred as a result solely of (u) the termination of that certain
Agreement between Autoweb and Lycos, Inc. dated March 26, 2000 pursuant to that
certain Settlement and Termination Agreement and Release between such parties in
the form attached hereto as Exhibit C and the execution of a new agreement
between Lycos, Inc. and Autoweb in the form of Exhibit D and any payments or
other actions called for by such settlement agreement, (v) any action required
by this Agreement, including, without limitation, any adverse effect resulting
from the delivery of any notice pursuant to Section 4.2(xix), (w) a decrease in
such Person's stock price or the failure to meet or exceed Wall Street research
analysts' or such entity's internal earnings estimates or projections, (x)
general economic conditions affecting generally the industry in which such
Person competes, (y) general market conditions in the United States or (z) any
adverse effect resulting from the announcement of this Agreement or the Merger.
In this Agreement, any reference to a party's "knowledge" means such party's
actual knowledge after reasonable inquiry of employees, officers and directors
of such party charged with senior administrative or operational responsibility
for such matters. Except as disclosed for a particular statement in the specific
corresponding section of the document of even date herewith delivered by Autoweb
to Autobytel prior to the execution and delivery of this Agreement (the "Autoweb
Disclosure Schedule") corresponding to the Section of this Agreement to which
any of the following representations and warranties specifically relate, Autoweb
represents and warrants to Autobytel and Merger Sub as follows:

     2.1  Organization, and Qualification; No Subsidiaries. Autoweb is a
corporation duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws
of the state of Delaware and is qualified to do business and in good standing as
a foreign corporation in each jurisdiction where the properties owned, leased or
operated, or the business conducted, by it require such qualification, except
where failure to so qualify or be in good standing is not reasonably likely to
have a Material Adverse Effect on Autoweb. Autoweb has the corporate power and
authority and all necessary governmental approvals to own, lease and operate its
properties and to
                                       A-5

carry on its business as it is now being conducted, except where the failure to
have such power, or authority and governmental approvals is not reasonably
likely, individually or in the aggregate, to have a Material Adverse Effect on
Autoweb. Autoweb has heretofore made available to Autobytel a complete and
correct copy of its Certificate of Incorporation (including all Certificates of
Determination or the equivalent thereof) and Bylaws, each as amended to the date
hereof (the "Certificate of Incorporation" and "Bylaws", respectively). Such
Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws are in full force and effect. Autoweb is
not in violation of any provision of its Certificate of Incorporation or Bylaws.
Autoweb does not have any subsidiaries.

     2.2  Capitalization. The authorized capital stock of Autoweb consists of
60,000,000 shares of Autoweb Common Stock and 13,649,976 shares of preferred
stock ("Preferred Stock"), 2,474,486 shares of which were formerly designated
Series A Preferred Stock, 2,550,000 shares of which were formerly designated
Series B Preferred Stock, 2,369,969 shares of which were formerly designated
Series C Preferred Stock and 1,255,521 shares of which were formerly designated
Series D Preferred Stock. As of the close of business on March 28, 2001,
29,526,453 shares of Autoweb Common Stock were issued and outstanding and no
shares of Preferred Stock were issued and outstanding. As of the close of
business on March 28, 2001, except for (a) 3,757,293 shares of Autoweb Common
Stock reserved for issuance pursuant to outstanding Autoweb Options disclosed in
Section 5.12 of the Autoweb Disclosure Schedule and (b) 951,237 shares of
Autoweb Common Stock reserved for issuance pursuant to Autoweb's 1999 Employee
Stock Purchase Plan, there are not now, and other than as permitted by Section
4.2(xv) hereof there will not be at the Effective Time any existing options,
warrants, calls, subscriptions, or other rights, or other agreements or
commitments, obligating Autoweb to issue, transfer or sell any shares of capital
stock of Autoweb or bonds, debentures, notes or other indebtedness having voting
rights (or convertible into securities having such rights) of, or other equity
interest in, Autoweb or securities convertible into or exchangeable for such
shares or equity interest or obligating Autoweb to grant, extend or enter into
any such option, warrant, call, subscription or other right, agreement,
arrangement or commitment. Since March 28, 2001, Autoweb has not issued any
shares of its capital stock, except pursuant to the exercise of Autoweb Options
outstanding on March 28, 2001. All issued and outstanding shares of Autoweb
Common Stock are, and all shares of Autoweb Common Stock which may be issued
pursuant to the exercise of outstanding Autoweb Options will be when issued in
accordance with the respective terms thereof, duly authorized and validly
issued, fully paid and nonassessable, and such issuance will not violate any
preemptive rights under law or otherwise. There are no outstanding contractual
obligations of Autoweb to repurchase, redeem or otherwise acquire any shares of
Autoweb Common Stock or the capital stock or other security of Autoweb.

     2.3  Authority; Governmental Consents.

     (a) Authority. Autoweb has the corporate power and authority to execute and
deliver this Agreement and, subject only to the approval and adoption of this
Agreement and the Certificate of Merger by the stockholders of Autoweb as
contemplated by Section 6.1(a), to consummate the transactions contemplated
hereby. The execution and delivery of this Agreement by Autoweb and the
consummation by Autoweb of the transactions contemplated hereby have been duly
and validly authorized by all necessary corporate action on the part of Autoweb,
subject, in the case of the Merger, to the approval thereof by the stockholders
of Autoweb. This Agreement has been duly and validly executed and delivered by
Autoweb, and, assuming this Agreement constitutes a valid and binding obligation
of Autobytel and Merger Sub, this Agreement constitutes a valid and binding
agreement of Autoweb, enforceable against Autoweb in accordance with its terms
(except in all cases as such enforceability may be limited by applicable
bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium, or similar laws affecting
the enforcement of creditor's rights generally and except that the availability
of the equitable remedy of specific performance or injunctive relief is subject
to the discretion of any court before which any proceeding may be brought).

     (b) Governmental Consents. Other than (i) in connection with, or in
compliance with, the provisions of Delaware Law with respect to the transactions
contemplated hereby, the federal securities laws, the securities laws of the
various states, the rules of the National Association of Securities Dealers,
Inc., (ii) notices to or filings with the Internal Revenue Service (the "IRS")
or the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation with respect to employee benefit
plans, or under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as
amended (the "HSR Act") and (iii) where the failure to so have or keep in force
would not result in a
                                       A-6

penalty, fine or other payment in excess of $50,000 or an inability to conduct
Autoweb's business as presently conducted, no authorization, consent or approval
of, or filing with, any Governmental Entity (as hereinafter defined) is
necessary for the consummation by Autoweb of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, except for the approval of Autoweb's stockholders. As used in
this Agreement, the term "Governmental Entity" means any government or
subdivision thereof, domestic, foreign or supranational or any administrative,
governmental or regulatory authority, agency, commission, tribunal or body,
domestic, foreign or supranational.

     2.4  No Violation. Neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement by
Autoweb nor the consummation by Autoweb of the transactions contemplated hereby
will (i) constitute a breach or violation of any provision of the Certificate of
Incorporation or Bylaws of Autoweb, (ii) constitute a breach, violation or
default (or any event which, with notice or lapse of time or both, would
constitute a default) under, or result in the termination of or permit any other
party to terminate, require the consent from or the giving of notice to any
other party to, or accelerate the performance required by, or result in the
creation of any lien or encumbrance upon any property or asset of Autoweb under,
any note, bond, mortgage, indenture, deed of trust, license, lease, agreement or
other instrument to which Autoweb, or by which it or any of its properties or
assets, are bound, or (iii) subject to the receipt of the requisite consents,
approvals, or authorizations of, or filings with Governmental Entities under
federal securities laws, applicable corporate and securities laws, the rules of
The Nasdaq Stock Market, Inc. and the National Association of Securities
Dealers, Inc. and laws relating to employee benefit plans, conflict with or
violate any order, judgment or decree, or to the knowledge of Autoweb, any
statute, ordinance, rule or regulation applicable to Autoweb, or by which it or
any of its properties or assets may be bound or affected, other than, in the
case of the foregoing clauses (ii) or (iii), conflicts, breaches, violations,
defaults, terminations, accelerations, requirements for consent or notice or
creation of liens and encumbrances which, individually or in the aggregate,
would not be reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse Effect on Autoweb.

     2.5  SEC Reports and Financial Statements. Autoweb has filed with the
Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC"), and has made available to
Autobytel, copies of all forms, reports and documents (the "Autoweb SEC
Documents") required to be filed by it under the Securities Act of 1933, as
amended (the "Securities Act") or the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as
amended (the "Exchange Act"). None of such Autoweb SEC Documents (as of their
respective filing dates) contained any untrue statement of a material fact or
omitted to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in
order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which
they were made, not misleading (except any statement or omission therein which
has been corrected or otherwise disclosed or updated in a subsequent Autoweb SEC
Document). The audited and unaudited financial statements of Autoweb included in
any Autoweb SEC Document (the "Autoweb Financial Statements") have been prepared
in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles applied on a
consistent basis (except as otherwise stated in such financial statements,
including the related notes), comply as to form in all material respects with
applicable accounting requirements and the published rules and regulations of
the SEC with respect thereto and fairly present the financial position of
Autoweb as of the dates thereof and the results of its operations and changes in
financial position for the periods then ended, subject, in the case of the
unaudited financial statements, to normal year-end audit adjustments, and except
for the absence of certain footnote information in the unaudited statements.
Autoweb does not have any material liabilities or obligations of any nature
(whether absolute, accrued, contingent, unmatured, unaccrued, unliquidated,
unasserted, conditional or otherwise), except for liabilities or obligations (i)
reflected or reserved against on its balance sheet as at September 30, 2000
(including the notes thereto and the other disclosures made in Autoweb's Form
10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2000) (the "Autoweb Balance Sheet")
included in the Autoweb SEC Documents, or (ii) incurred in the ordinary course
of business consistent with past practice since such date. Any such liability
incurred in the ordinary course of business since September 30, 2000, which as
of the date of this Agreement individually or taken together with all related
liabilities in the aggregate exceeds $250,000 is listed or described in Section
2.5 of the Autoweb Disclosure Schedule.

     2.6  Compliance with Applicable Laws and Permits; Regulatory
Matters. Autoweb has in effect and holds all permits, licenses, orders,
authorizations, registrations, approvals and other analogous instruments, and

                                       A-7

Autoweb has made all filings and registrations and the like necessary or
required by law to conduct its business as presently conducted, other than such
permits, licenses, orders, authorizations, registrations, approvals, and other
instruments, the absence of which is not reasonably likely to have a Material
Adverse Effect on Autoweb. Autoweb has not received any written governmental
notices within two years prior to the date hereof alleging any violation by
Autoweb of any such laws, rules, regulations or orders that has not been cured
as of the date hereof. Autoweb is not in default or noncompliance under any (a)
permits, consents, or similar instruments, and (b) business and local and county
laws, ordinances, regulations, judgments, orders, decrees or rules of any court,
arbitrator or governmental, regulatory or administrative agency or entity, other
than such default or noncompliance which is not reasonably likely to have a
Material Adverse Effect on Autoweb.

     2.7  Certain Agreements Affected by the Merger. Except as set forth in
Section 2.7 of the Autoweb Disclosure Schedule, neither the execution and
delivery of this Agreement nor the consummation of the transactions contemplated
hereby will (i) result in any payment (including, without limitation, severance,
unemployment compensation, golden parachute, bonus or otherwise) becoming due to
any director, consultant or employee of Autoweb, (ii) increase any benefits
otherwise payable by Autoweb to any Person or result in the acceleration of the
time of payment or vesting of any such benefits, or (iii) result in any other
detriment or require any other payment under the terms, conditions or provisions
of any note, bond, mortgage or indenture or require a payment in excess of
$50,000 under the terms, conditions or provisions of any license, lease,
contract, agreement or other instrument or obligation, in either case to which
Autoweb is a party or by which it or any of its properties or assets may be
bound.

     2.8  Litigation. Except as set forth in Section 2.8 of the Autoweb
Disclosure Schedule, there is no suit, claim, action, proceeding or
investigation pending or, to the knowledge of Autoweb, threatened, against
Autoweb and no such item listed in such Section 2.8, individually or in the
aggregate, if adversely determined is reasonably likely to have a Material
Adverse Effect on Autoweb or would reasonably be expected to prevent or
materially delay the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. Autoweb is not a party to or bound by any outstanding order, writ,
injunction or decree which, individually or in the aggregate, is reasonably
likely to have a Material Adverse Effect on Autoweb or would reasonably be
expected to prevent or materially delay the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby.

     2.9  Registration Statement; Proxy Statement/Prospectus. The information
supplied by Autoweb for inclusion in the registration statement on Form S-4 (or
such other or successor form as shall be appropriate) pursuant to which the
shares of Autobytel Common Stock to be issued in the Merger will be registered
with the SEC (the "Registration Statement") shall not at the time the
Registration Statement (including any amendments or supplements thereto) is
declared effective by the SEC contain any untrue statement of a material fact or
omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in
order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which
they were made, not misleading. The information supplied by Autoweb for
inclusion in the joint proxy statement/prospectus to be sent to the stockholders
of Autoweb in connection with the meeting of Autoweb's stockholders to consider
the Merger (the "Autoweb Stockholders Meeting") and to the stockholders of
Autobytel in connection with the Autobytel Stockholders Meeting (as defined in
Section 3.8 hereof) (such joint proxy statement/prospectus as amended or
supplemented is referred to herein as the "Proxy Statement") shall not, on the
date the Proxy Statement is first mailed to Autoweb's stockholders and
Autobytel's stockholders, at the time of the Autoweb Stockholders Meeting, the
Autobytel Stockholders Meeting or at the Effective Time, contain any statement
which, at any such time, is false or misleading with respect to any material
fact, or omit to state any material fact necessary in order to make the
statements made therein, in light of the circumstances under which they are
made, not false or misleading; or omit to state any material fact necessary to
correct any statement in any earlier communication with respect to the
solicitation of proxies for the Autoweb Stockholders Meeting or Autobytel
Stockholder Meeting which has become false or misleading. If at any time prior
to the Effective Time any event or information should be discovered by Autoweb
which should be set forth in an amendment to the Registration Statement or a
supplement to the Proxy Statement, Autoweb shall promptly inform Autobytel and
Merger Sub. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Autoweb makes no representation,
warranty or covenant with respect to any information supplied by or respecting
Autobytel or Merger Sub (other than information supplied by and with respect to
Autoweb) which is contained in any of the foregoing documents.

                                       A-8

     2.10  Employee Benefit Plans.

     (a) Plans. Section 2.10(a) of the Autoweb Disclosure Schedule includes a
complete list of all employee benefit plans and programs providing benefits to
any employee or former employee of Autoweb sponsored or maintained by Autoweb or
to which Autoweb contributes or is obligated to contribute ("Plans") and all
written employment, severance, consulting and other compensation contracts
between Autoweb and any current, or former to the extent obligations of Autoweb
are outstanding, director, officer, employee or consultant thereof as to which
there is any current or potential Autoweb liability or obligation ("Employment
Contracts"). Autoweb is not party to any oral Employment Contract that is not
terminable at will. No oral Employment Contract requires payments by Autoweb in
excess of $50,000 annually. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing,
the term "Plans" includes all employee welfare benefit plans within the meaning
of Section 3(1) of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as
amended, and the regulations thereunder ("ERISA"), and all employee pension
benefit plans within the meaning of Section 3(2) of ERISA.

     (b) Documents. With respect to each Plan, Autoweb has made available to
Autobytel a true, correct and complete copy of: (i) all plan documents, benefit
schedules, trust agreements, and insurance contracts and other funding vehicles;
(ii) the most recent Annual Report (Form 5500 Series) and accompanying schedule,
if any; (iii) the current summary plan description, if any; (iv) the most recent
annual financial report, if any; (v) the most recent actuarial report, if any;
(vi) the most recent determination letter from the IRS, if any; and (vii) each
Employment Contract.

     (c) Compliance. Except as set forth in Section 2.10(c) of the Autoweb
Disclosure Schedule, all Plans are in compliance with all applicable provisions
of ERISA, the Code and all laws and regulations applicable to the Plans, except
where the failure with which to comply is not reasonably likely to have a
Material Adverse Effect. With respect to each Plan that is intended to be a
"qualified plan" within the meaning of Section 401(a) of the Code ("Qualified
Plans"), either (i) the IRS has issued a favorable determination opinion,
notification or advisory letter, a copy of which has been provided to Autobytel
or (ii) such Plan has remaining a period of time specified in Section 2.10 of
the Autoweb Disclosure Schedules under applicable IRS pronouncements in which to
apply for such letter and make any amendments that are necessary to obtain a
favorable determination as to the qualified status of such Plan.

     (d) Contributions. Except as set forth in Section 2.10(d) of the Autoweb
Disclosure Schedule, all contributions required to be made by Autoweb to any
Plan under applicable law or regulation or by any plan document or other
contractual undertaking, and all premiums due or payable with respect to
insurance policies funding any Plan, have been timely made or paid in full or,
to the extent not required to be made or paid, have been fully reflected in the
financial statements of Autoweb included in the Autoweb SEC Documents to the
extent required under generally accepted accounting principles.

     (e) Multi-Employer Plan Etc. No Plan is subject to Title IV or Section 302
of ERISA or Section 412 or 4971 of the Code. Without limiting the generality of
the foregoing, no Plan is a "multi-employer plan" within the meaning of Section
4001(a)(3) of ERISA (a "Multi-Employer Plan") or a plan that has two or more
contributing sponsors at least two of whom are not under common control, within
the meaning of Section 4063 of ERISA and which is subject to Title IV of ERISA
(a "Multiple Employer Plan").

     (f) Liabilities. There does not now exist, nor, to the knowledge of
Autoweb, do any circumstances exist that would reasonably be expected to result
in, any liability under (i) Title IV of ERISA, (ii) Section 302 of ERISA, (iii)
Sections 412 and 4971 of the Code, (iv) the continuation coverage requirements
of Section 601 et seq. of ERISA and Section 4980B of the Code, or (v)
corresponding or similar provisions of foreign laws or regulations, other than a
liability that arises solely out of, or relates solely to, the Plans, that would
be a liability of Autoweb following the Effective Time. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, (i) neither of Autoweb nor any ERISA Affiliate of
Autoweb has engaged in any transaction described in Section 4069 or Section 4204
or 4212 of ERISA, (ii) no liability under Title IV or a violation of Section 302
of ERISA has been incurred by Autoweb that has not been satisfied in full, and
Autoweb is not aware of any condition that exists that presents a material risk
to Autoweb of incurring any such liability, other than liability for premiums
due to the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (which premiums have been paid
when due) and for
                                       A-9

contributions due to a pension plan (for which a contribution has been paid
through the end of 2000), and (iii) no Plan or any trust established thereunder
has incurred any "accumulated funding deficiency" (as defined in Section 302 of
ERISA and Section 412 of the Code), whether or not waived, as of the last day of
the most recent fiscal year of each Plan ended prior to the Effective Time. An
"ERISA Affiliate" means any entity, trade or business that is a member of a
group described in Section 414(b), (c), (m) or (o) of the Code or Section
4001(b)(1) of ERISA that includes Autoweb, or that is a member of the same
"controlled group" as Autoweb, pursuant to Section 4001(a)(14) of ERISA.

     (g) Claims. There are no pending, and to the knowledge of Autoweb, no
threatened or anticipated claims by or on behalf of any Plan, by any employee or
beneficiary covered under any such Plan, or otherwise involving any such Plan
(other than routine claims for benefits).

     (h) COBRA etc. With respect to each Plan, Autoweb has complied except to
the extent that such failure to comply is not, individually or in the aggregate,
reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse Effect on Autoweb, with (i) the
applicable health care continuation and notice provisions of the Consolidated
Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985 ("COBRA") and the regulations
(including proposed regulations) thereunder, (ii) the applicable requirements of
the Family Medical and Leave Act of 1993 and the regulations thereunder, and
(iii) the applicable requirements of the Health Insurance Portability and
Accountability Act of 1996 and the regulations thereunder.

     2.11  Intellectual Property.

     (a) Certain Definitions. The term "Intellectual Property Rights" shall mean
intellectual property rights arising from or in respect to the following:

          (i) fictional business names, trade names, trademarks and service
     marks, logos, Internet domain names, and general intangibles of a like
     nature (collectively, "Marks");

     of algorithms, models and methodologies, whether in source code or object
     code, databases and compilations, flow-charts and other work product used
     to design, plan, organize and develop any of the foregoing (collectively,
     "Software").

     (b) Marks. Section 2.11(b) of the Autoweb Disclosure Schedule sets forth an
accurate and complete list of all registered Marks, pending applications for
registration of any Marks and material unregistered Marks, in each case owned by
Autoweb or used by Autoweb in its business as presently conducted (collectively,
"Owned Marks"). Except as set forth in Section 2.11(b) of the Autoweb Disclosure
Schedule, Autoweb has the right to use each of the Owned Marks which are

(collectively, "Owned Patents"). Except as set forth on Section 2.11(c) of the

     to protect Autoweb's rights in

                                       A-10

     and to the Owned Patents, and Autoweb has not received any written notice
     or claim challenging Autoweb's exclusive ownership of the Owned Patents;

          (ii) Autoweb has not taken any action or failed to take any action,
     conducted its business, or used or enforced (or failed to use or enforce)
     any of the Owned Patents in a manner that would result in the abandonment
     or unenforceability of any of the Owned Patents ("abandonment" as used in
     this clause (ii) shall not include terminal disclaimers and similar actions
     taken in connection with, and the results of, oppositions, re-examinations,
     reissues, litigation, interferences and similar proceedings);

          (iii) to Autoweb's knowledge, the inventions disclosed in the Owned
     Patents may be practiced by Autoweb without infringing any other Patents
     owned by any other Person;

          (iv) Autoweb has not granted to any other Person any right, license or

     technology, products or operations of any other Person has infringed or is
     infringing on any of the Owned Patents.

     (d) Owned Copyrights/Maskworks. There are no registered Copyrights or mask

     2.15  Restrictions on Business Activities. There is no agreement, judgment,

conduct of business by Autoweb.

     2.16  Title to Property. Autoweb has good and valid title to its
properties, interests in properties and assets, real and personal, used in its
business and reflected in the Autoweb Balance Sheet or acquired after the

Autoweb Balance Sheet Date (except properties, interests in properties and
assets sold or otherwise disposed of since the Autoweb Balance Sheet Date in the

generally accepted accounting principles require the same to be reflected.
Section 2.16 of the Autoweb Disclosure Schedule identifies each parcel of real
property owned or leased by Autoweb as of the date of this Agreement.

     2.17  Environmental Matters.

     (a) Hazardous Materials. During the period that Autoweb has owned or leased
its properties and facilities, (i) there have been no disposals, releases or
threatened releases of Hazardous Materials (as defined below) on, from or under
such properties or facilities by or on behalf of Autoweb or, to the knowledge of
Autoweb, any other Person, in either case in violation of applicable laws, and
(ii) neither Autoweb nor, to Autoweb's knowledge, any other Person, has used,
generated, manufactured or stored on, under or about such properties or

Autoweb in excess of $50,000. Autoweb has no knowledge of any presence,
disposals, releases or threatened releases of Hazardous Materials on, from or
under any such properties or facilities, which may have occurred prior to
Autoweb having taken possession of any such properties or facilities and which
would be reasonably likely to result in liability to Autoweb in excess of
$50,000.

"disposal," "release," and "threatened release" shall have the definitions
assigned thereto by the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and
Liability Act of 1980, 42 U.S.C. Section 9601 et seq., as amended ("CERCLA").
For the purposes of this Section, "Hazardous Materials" shall mean any hazardous
or toxic substance, material or waste which is regulated under, or defined as a

     2.18  Employee Matters. Except as is not reasonably likely to result,
individually or in the aggregate, in a Material Adverse Effect on Autoweb,
Autoweb is in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations respecting
employment, discrimination in employment, terms and conditions of employment,
wages, hours and occupational safety and health and employment practices, and is
not engaged in any unfair labor practice. Autoweb has withheld all amounts
required by law or by agreement to be withheld from the wages, salaries, and
other payments to employees; and is not liable for any arrears of wages, except
for arrears of wages less than $25,000 in the aggregate, or any taxes, except
for taxes less than $25,000 in the aggregate, or any penalty for failure to

in the aggregate. Autoweb is not liable for any payment to any trust or other
fund or to any governmental or administrative authority, with respect to
unemployment compensation benefits, social security or other benefits or
obligations for employees (other than routine payments to be made in the normal
course of business and consistent with past practice), which in the aggregate
exceed $25,000. There are no pending claims against Autoweb for any amounts
under any workers compensation plan or policy or for long term disability, which
in the aggregate exceed $25,000. Autoweb does not have any obligations under
COBRA with respect to any former employees
                                       A-13

than $25,000 in the aggregate. There are no controversies pending or, to the
knowledge of Autoweb, threatened, between Autoweb and any of its employees or
former employees, which controversies have or would reasonably be expected to
result in an action, suit, proceeding, claim, arbitration or investigation
before any agency, court or tribunal, foreign or domestic. Autoweb is not a
party to any collective bargaining agreement or other labor union contract and
Autoweb is not aware of any activities or proceedings of any labor union to
organize any such employees. To Autoweb's knowledge, no employees of Autoweb are
in violation of any term of any employment contract, patent disclosure
agreement, noncompetition agreement, or any restrictive covenant to a former
employer relating to the right of any such employee to be employed by Autoweb
because of the nature of the business conducted or presently proposed to be
conducted by Autoweb or to the use of trade secrets or proprietary information
of others.

     2.19  Interested Party Transactions. Except as disclosed in the Autoweb SEC
Documents, Autoweb is not indebted to any director or officer of Autoweb (except
for amounts due as normal salaries and bonuses and in reimbursement of ordinary
expenses), and no such Person is indebted to Autoweb and there are no other
transactions of the type required to be disclosed pursuant to Items 402 and 404
of Regulation S-K under the Securities Act and the Exchange Act.

     2.20  Insurance. Section 2.20 of the Autoweb Disclosure Schedule contains a
complete list of all insurance policies and bonds to which Autoweb is a party or
which pertain to Autoweb's assets. There is no claim pending under any of such
policies or bonds as to which coverage has been questioned, denied or disputed
by the underwriters of such policies or bonds. All premiums due and payable
under all such policies and bonds have been paid and Autoweb is otherwise in
compliance in all material respects with the terms of such policies and bonds.
Autoweb has no knowledge of any threatened termination of, or premium increase
with respect to, any of such policies.

     2.21  Minute Books. The minute books of Autoweb have been made available to
Autobytel and contain a complete and accurate summary of all meetings of
directors, including committees of the board of directors, and stockholders or
actions by written consent since the time of incorporation of Autoweb through
the date of this Agreement, and reflect all transactions referred to in such
minutes accurately in all material respects.

     2.22  Complete Copies of Materials. Autoweb has delivered or made available
true and complete copies of each document listed on the Autoweb Disclosure

to the Merger, this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby.

     2.25  Dealers/Customers. Autoweb has not received any notice and does not
have any reason to believe that any dealer or category partner will seek to
terminate or modify in a manner adverse to Autoweb its relationship with Autoweb
as a result of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

     2.26  Brokers' and Finders' Fees. Except for payment obligations to Credit

view, to holders of the Autoweb Common Stock.

     2.28  Voting Agreement. The Voting Agreement referred to in Section 5.9
hereof has been executed and delivered by Autoweb and the Persons named in
Schedule 5.9 and constitutes a valid and binding
                                       A-14

obligation of Autoweb, enforceable against Autoweb in accordance with its terms
(except in all cases as such enforceability may be limited by applicable
bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium, or similar laws affecting
the enforcement of creditor's rights generally and except that the availability
of the equitable remedy of specific performance or injunctive relief is subject
to the discretion of any court before which any proceeding may be brought).

     2.29  Tax Representations.

     (a) The term "Taxes" means all net income, capital gains, gross income,
gross receipts, sales, use, transfer, ad valorem, franchise, profits, license,
capital, withholding, payroll, employment, excise, goods and services,
severance, stamp, occupation, premium, property, assessments, or other
governmental charges of any kind whatsoever, together with any interest, fines
and any penalties, additions to tax or other additional amounts incurred,
accrued with respect thereto, assessed, charged or imposed under applicable
federal, state, local or foreign tax law, provided that any interest, penalties,
additions to tax or additional amounts that relate to Taxes for any taxable
period (including any portion of any taxable period ending on or before the
Closing Date) shall be deemed to be Taxes for such period, regardless of when
such items are incurred, accrued, assessed or charged. References to Autoweb
shall be deemed to include any predecessor to Autoweb or any Person from which
Autoweb incurs a liability for Taxes as a result of transferee liability.

     (b) Autoweb has duly filed (and prior to the Closing Date will duly file),
on a timely basis taking into account extensions, all material tax returns,
reports, statements or estimates ("Tax Returns") that were due or will be due
prior to the Closing Date. Such returns, reports, statements or estimates have
been, or will be, prepared in accordance with applicable laws, for all years and
periods (and portions thereof), for all jurisdictions (whether federal, state,
local or foreign) in which any such returns, reports or estimates were due, or
will be due, prior to the Closing Date. No material adjustments relating to such
returns have been proposed formally or informally by any taxing authority and,
to the knowledge of Autoweb, no basis exists for any material adjustment. All
Taxes shown as due and payable on such returns, reports and estimates have been
paid (or will be paid prior to the Closing), and there is no current liability
for any material Taxes due and payable.

     (c) The Autoweb Balance Sheet reflects adequate reserves in accordance with
generally accepted accounting principles (without regard to any amounts reserved
for deferred Taxes) for all liabilities for Taxes accrued by Autoweb but not yet
paid for all Tax periods and portions thereof through the date of the Autoweb
Balance Sheet. Since the date of the Autoweb Balance Sheet, Autoweb has not
incurred any liability for Taxes other than in the ordinary course of business.

     (d) Autoweb is not, or within the five year period preceding the Closing
Date has not been, an S corporation within the meaning of Section 1361(a) of the
Code.

     (e) Autoweb has withheld all required amounts from its employees, agents,
contractors, nonresidents, creditors, stockholders and third parties and
remitted such amounts to the proper authorities; paid all employer contributions
and premiums; and filed all federal, state, local and foreign returns and
reports with respect to employee income Tax withholding, and social security and
unemployment Taxes and premiums, all in compliance with the withholding
provisions of the Code, or any prior provision of the Code and other applicable
Laws, except to the extent that any failure to do so is not reasonably likely to
have a Material Adverse Effect on Autoweb.

     (f) Autoweb does not have a permanent establishment in any foreign country.

     (g) There are no claims or investigations by the IRS or any other tax
authority pending or, to the knowledge of Autoweb, threatened against Autoweb
for any past due Taxes in excess of $50,000 individually or in the aggregate,
and Autoweb has no reason to expect any taxing authority to assess any material
additional taxes for any period for which tax returns were filed; there has been
no waiver granted or requested of any applicable statute of limitations or
extension of the time for the assessment of any Tax of Autoweb for which Autoweb
could be liable under any provision of federal, state, local, or foreign law. No
closing agreement (as defined in section 7121 of the Code) or any similar
provision of any state, local, or foreign law has been entered into by or with
respect to Autoweb.
                                       A-15

     (h) There are no liens or encumbrances for any Tax that is due and payable
prior to the Closing Date upon any asset of Autoweb.

     (i) No power of attorney that is currently in force has been granted to any
person with respect to any matter relating to Taxes that could materially
adversely affect Autoweb.

     (j) Autoweb does not have any item of income, gain, loss or deduction
reportable in a taxable period ending after the date hereof but attributable to
a transaction that occurred in a taxable period or portion thereof ending on or
before the date hereof.

     (k) Except as set forth on Section 2.29(k) of the Autoweb Disclosure
Schedule, Autoweb has never been included in nor is includible in any
consolidated, combined or unitary Tax Return with any entity.

     (l) Autoweb is not a party to and is not bound by, and Autoweb does not
have any obligation under, any Tax sharing, Tax indemnity or similar agreement.

     (m) Autoweb is not a party to any agreement or arrangement which payment
thereunder would result, separately or in the aggregate, due to the consummation
of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, in the payment of any
"excess parachute payments" within the meaning of Section 280G of the Code or an
excise Tax to the recipient of such payment pursuant to Section 4999 of the
Code. No acceleration of the vesting schedule for any property of Autoweb that
is substantially unvested within the meaning of the regulations under Section 83
of the Code will occur in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. Autoweb is not a party to any agreement or arrangement which,
individually or collectively with respect to any person, could give rise to the
payment of any amount, due to the consummation of the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement, that would not be deductible by Autoweb by reason of Section
162(a)(1) or 162(m) of the Code.

     (n) Autoweb is not, and has not been, a United States real property holding
corporation within the meaning of Section 897(c)(2) of the Code during the
applicable period specified in Section 897(c)(1)(A)(ii) of the Code. Prior to
the Closing Date, Autoweb will provide a statement to Autobytel pursuant to
Section 1.1445-2(c)(3) of the Treasury Regulations, to that effect.

     (o) There are no proposed reassessments of any property owned by Autoweb or
other proposals that could increase the amount of any Tax to which Autoweb would
be subject.

     (p) Autoweb has not filed a consent pursuant to Section 341(f) of the Code
or agreed to have Section 341(f)(2) of the Code apply to any disposition of any
asset owned by Autoweb.

     (q) Autoweb has not constituted either a "distributing corporation" or a
"controlled corporation" in a distribution of stock qualifying for tax free
treatment under Section 355 of the Code (i) in the two years prior to the date
of this Agreement or (ii) in a distribution which could otherwise constitute
part of a "plan" or "series of related transactions" (within the meaning of
Section 355(e) of the Code) in connection with the Merger.

     2.30  Representations Complete. None of the representations or warranties
made by Autoweb herein or in any Schedule hereto, including the Autoweb
Disclosure Schedule, or certificate furnished by Autoweb pursuant to this
Agreement, or the Autoweb SEC Documents, when all such documents are read
together in their entirety, contains or will contain at the Effective Time any
untrue statement of a material fact, or omits or will omit at the Effective Time
to state any material fact necessary in order to make the statements contained
herein or therein, in the light of the circumstances under which made, not
misleading.

                                  ARTICLE III.

                         REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES
                          OF AUTOBYTEL AND MERGER SUB

     Except as disclosed for a particular statement in the specific
corresponding section of the document of even date herewith delivered by
Autobytel to Autoweb prior to the execution and delivery of this Agreement

                                       A-16

(the "Autobytel Disclosure Schedule") corresponding to the Section of this
Agreement to which any of the following representations and warranties
specifically relate, Autobytel represents and warrants to Autoweb as follows:

     3.1  Organization, and Qualification. Each of Merger Sub and Autobytel is a
corporation duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws
of the state of Delaware and is qualified to do business and in good standing as
a foreign corporation in each jurisdiction where the properties owned, leased or
operated, or the business conducted, by it require such qualification, except
where failure to so qualify or be in good standing is not reasonably likely to
have a Material Adverse Effect on Autobytel. Each of Merger Sub and Autobytel
has the corporate power and authority and all necessary governmental approvals
to own, lease and operate its properties and to carry on its business as it is
now being conducted, except where the failure to have such power, or authority
and governmental approvals is not reasonably likely, individually or in the
aggregate, to have a Material Adverse Effect on Autobytel. Each of Merger Sub
and Autobytel has heretofore made available to Autoweb a complete and correct
copy of its Certificate of Incorporation (including all Certificates of
Determination or the equivalent thereof) and Bylaws, each as amended to the date
hereof (collectively, the "Autobytel Certificate of Incorporation" and
"Autobytel Bylaws", respectively). The Autobytel Certificate of Incorporation
and Autobytel Bylaws are in full force and effect. Neither Merger Sub nor
Autobytel is in violation of any provision of its Certificate of Incorporation
or Bylaws. Autobytel does not have any subsidiaries except Merger Sub and as
disclosed, to the extent required, in the Autobytel SEC Documents (as defined
below).

     3.2  Capitalization. The authorized capital stock of Autobytel consists of
200,000,000 shares of Autobytel Common Stock and 11,445,187 shares of preferred
stock. As of the close of business on March 28, 2001, 20,364,070 shares of
Autobytel Common Stock were issued and outstanding and no shares of Preferred
Stock were issued and outstanding. The authorized capital stock of Merger Sub
consists of 100 shares of common stock, all of which are issued and outstanding
and owned by Autobytel. As of the close of business on March 15, 2001, except
for (a) 6,256,509 shares of Autobytel Common Stock reserved for issuance
pursuant to outstanding options of Autobytel (the "Autobytel Options") and
outstanding warrants of Autobytel to purchase 739,800 shares of capital stock of
Autobytel (the "Autobytel Warrants") and (b) 391,826 shares of Autobytel Common
Stock reserved for issuance pursuant to Autobytel's employee stock purchase
plan, there are not now any existing options, warrants, calls, subscriptions, or
other rights, or other agreements or commitments, obligating Autobytel or Merger
Sub to issue, transfer or sell any shares of its capital stock or bonds,
debentures, notes or other indebtedness having voting rights (or convertible
into securities having such rights) of, or other equity interest in, Autobytel
or securities convertible into or exchangeable for such shares or equity
interest or obligating Autobytel or Merger Sub to grant, extend or enter into
any such option, warrant, call, subscription or other right, agreement,
arrangement or commitment. Since March 15, 2001, Autobytel has not issued any
shares of its capital stock, except pursuant to the exercise of Autobytel
Options, Autobytel's employee stock purchase plan and Autobytel's Retirement
Savings Plan. All issued and outstanding shares of Autobytel Common Stock are,
and all shares of Autobytel Common Stock which may be issued pursuant to the
exercise of outstanding Autobytel Options and Autobytel Warrants will be when
issued in accordance with the respective terms thereof, duly authorized and
validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable, and such issuance will not violate
any preemptive rights under law or otherwise. There are no outstanding
contractual obligations of Autobytel or Merger Sub to repurchase, redeem or
otherwise acquire any of its shares or other securities.

     3.3  Authority; Governmental Consents.

     (a) Authority. Each of Merger Sub and Autobytel has the corporate power and
authority to execute and deliver this Agreement and, subject only to the
approval by the sole stockholder of Merger Sub, to consummate the transactions
contemplated hereby. The execution and delivery of this Agreement by Autobytel
and Merger Sub and the consummation by Autobytel and Merger Sub of the
transactions contemplated hereby have been duly and validly authorized by all
necessary corporate action on the part of Autobytel and Merger Sub, subject to
the approval set forth in Section 3.12. This Agreement has been duly and validly
executed and delivered by Autobytel and Merger Sub, and, assuming this Agreement
constitutes a valid and binding obligation of Autoweb, this Agreement
constitutes a valid and binding agreement of
                                       A-17

Autobytel and Merger Sub, enforceable against Autobytel and Merger Sub in
accordance with its terms (except in all cases as such enforceability may be
limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium, or
similar laws affecting the enforcement of creditor's rights generally and except
that the availability of the equitable remedy of specific performance or
injunctive relief is subject to the discretion of any court before which any
proceeding may be brought).

     (b) Governmental Consents. Other than (i) in connection with, or in
compliance with, the provisions of Delaware Law with respect to the transactions
contemplated hereby, the federal securities laws, the securities laws of the
various states, the rules of the National Association of Securities Dealers,
Inc., (ii) notices to or filings with the IRS or the Pension Benefit Guaranty
Corporation with respect to employee benefit plans, or under the HSR Act and
(iii) where the failure to have or keep in force would not result in a penalty,
fine or other payment in excess of $150,000 or an inability to conduct
Autobytel's business as presently conducted, no authorization, consent or
approval of, or filing with, any Governmental Entity is necessary for the
consummation by Autobytel or Merger Sub of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, except for the approval of Autobytel's stockholders required under
the rules of the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc.

     3.4  No Violation. Neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement by
Autobytel and Merger Sub nor the consummation by Autobytel and Merger Sub of the
transactions contemplated hereby will (i) constitute a breach or violation of
any provision of the Certificate of Incorporation or Bylaws of either of them,
(ii) constitute a breach, violation or default (or any event which, with notice
or lapse of time or both, would constitute a default) under, or result in the
termination of, or accelerate the performance required by, or result in the
creation of any lien or encumbrance upon any property or asset of Autobytel or
Merger Sub under, any note, bond, mortgage, indenture, deed of trust, license,
lease, agreement or other instrument to which Autobytel or Merger Sub, or by
which either of them or any of their properties or assets, are bound, or (iii)
subject to the receipt of the requisite consents, approvals, or authorizations
of, or filings with Governmental Entities under federal securities laws,
applicable corporate and securities laws, the rules of The Nasdaq Stock Market,
Inc. and the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. and laws relating
to employee benefit plans, conflict with or violate any order, judgment or
decree, or to the knowledge of Autobytel, any statute, ordinance, rule or
regulation applicable to Autobytel or Merger Sub, or by which it or any of its
properties or assets may be bound or affected, other than, in the case of the
foregoing clauses (ii) or (iii), conflicts, breaches, violations, defaults,
terminations, accelerations or creation of liens and encumbrances which,
individually or in the aggregate, would not be reasonably likely to have a
Material Adverse Effect on Autobytel.

     3.5  SEC Reports and Financial Statements. Autobytel has filed with the SEC
and has made available to Autoweb, copies of all forms, reports and documents
(the "Autobytel SEC Documents") required to be filed by it under the Securities
Act or the Exchange Act. None of such Autobytel SEC Documents (as of their
respective filing dates) contained any untrue statement of a material fact or
omitted to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in
order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which
they were made, not misleading (except any statement or omission therein which
has been corrected or otherwise disclosed or updated in a subsequent Autobytel
SEC Document). The audited and unaudited financial statements of Autobytel
included in any Autobytel SEC Document (the "Autobytel Financial Statements")
have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles
applied on a consistent basis (except as otherwise stated in such financial
statements, including the related notes), comply as to form in all material
respects with applicable accounting requirements and the published rules and
regulations of the SEC with respect thereto and fairly present the financial
position of Autobytel as of the dates thereof and the results of its operations
and changes in financial position for the periods then ended, subject, in the
case of the unaudited financial statements, to normal year-end audit
adjustments, and except for the absence of certain footnote information in the
unaudited statements. Autobytel does not have any material liabilities or
obligations of any nature (whether absolute, accrued, contingent, unmatured,
unaccrued, unliquidated, unasserted, conditional or otherwise), except for
liabilities or obligations (i) reflected or reserved against on its balance
sheet as at September 30, 2000 (including the notes thereto and the other
disclosures made in Autobytel's Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30,
2000) (the "Autobytel Balance Sheet") included in the Autobytel SEC Documents,
or (ii) incurred in the ordinary course of

                                       A-18

business consistent with past practice since such date. Any such liability
incurred in the ordinary course of business since September 30, 2000, which as
of the date of this Agreement individually or taken together with all related
liabilities in the aggregate exceeds $500,000, is listed or described on Section
3.5 of the Autobytel Disclosure Schedule.

     3.6  Compliance with Applicable Laws and Permits; Regulatory Matters. Each
of Merger Sub and Autobytel has in effect and holds all permits, licenses,
orders, authorizations, registrations, approvals and other analogous
instruments, and each of Merger Sub and Autobytel has made all filings and
registrations and the like necessary or required by law to conduct its business
as presently conducted, other than such permits, licenses, orders,
authorizations, registrations, approvals, and other instruments, the absence of
which is not reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse Effect on Autobytel.
Neither Merger Sub nor Autobytel has received any written governmental notices
within two years prior to the date hereof alleging any violation by Autobytel or
Merger Sub of any such laws, rules, regulations or orders that has not been
cured as of the date hereof. Neither Merger Sub nor Autobytel is in default or
noncompliance under any (a) permits, consents, or similar instruments, and (b)
business and local and county laws, ordinances, regulations, judgments, orders,
decrees or rules of any court, arbitrator or governmental, regulatory or
administrative agency or entity, other than such default or noncompliance which
is not reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse Effect on Autobytel.

     3.7  Litigation. Except as set forth on Section 3.7 of the Autobytel
Disclosure Schedule, there is no suit, claim, action, proceeding or
investigation pending or, to the knowledge of Autobytel, threatened, against
Autobytel or Merger Sub that, individually or in the aggregate, if adversely
determined is reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse Effect on Autobytel
or would reasonably be expected to prevent or materially delay the consummation
of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Neither Merger Sub nor
Autobytel is a party to or bound by any outstanding order, writ, injunction or
decree which, individually or in the aggregate, is reasonably likely to have a
Material Adverse Effect on Autobytel or would reasonably be expected to prevent
or materially delay the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby.

     3.8  Registration Statement; Proxy Statement/Prospectus. The information
supplied by Autobytel for inclusion in the Registration Statement shall not at
the time the Registration Statement (including any amendments or supplements
thereto) is declared effective by the SEC contain any untrue statement of a
material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein
or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. The information
supplied by Autobytel for inclusion in the Proxy Statement to be sent to the
stockholders of Autobytel in connection with the meeting of Autobytel's
stockholders to consider the Merger (the "Autobytel Stockholders Meeting") and
the Autoweb's stockholders in connection with the Autoweb Stockholders Meeting
shall not, on the date the Proxy Statement is first mailed to Autobytel's
stockholders and Autoweb's stockholders, at the time of the Autobytel
Stockholders Meeting, the Autoweb Stockholders Meeting or at the Effective Time,
contain any statement which, at any such time, is false or misleading with
respect to any material fact, or omit to state any material fact necessary in
order to make the statements made therein, in light of the circumstances under
which they are made, not false or misleading; or omit to state any material fact
necessary to correct any statement in any earlier communication with respect to
the solicitation of proxies for the Autobytel Stockholders Meeting or Autoweb
Stockholders Meeting which has become false or misleading. If at any time prior
to the Effective Time any event or information should be discovered by Autobytel
which should be set forth in an amendment to the Registration Statement or a
supplement to the Proxy Statement, Autobytel shall promptly inform Autoweb.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, Autobytel makes no representation, warranty or
covenant with respect to any information supplied by or respecting Autoweb
(other than information with respect to Autobytel) which is contained in any of
the foregoing documents.

     3.9  Employee Benefit Plans. The term "Autobytel Plans" shall mean all
employee benefit plans and programs providing benefits to any employee or former
employee of Autobytel or Merger Sub sponsored or maintained by Autobytel or
Merger Sub or to which Autobytel or Merger Sub contributes or is obligated to
contribute. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the term
"Autobytel Plans" includes all employee welfare benefit plans within the meaning
of Section 3(1) of the ERISA, and all employee pension benefit plans within the
meaning of Section 3(2) of ERISA. All Autobytel Plans are in compliance with all
applicable
                                       A-19

provisions of ERISA, the Code and all laws and regulations applicable to the
Autobytel Plans, except where the failure with which to comply is not reasonably
likely to have a Material Adverse Effect. There does not now exist, nor do any
circumstances exist that would reasonably be expected to result in, any
liability that is not reflected in the Autobytel Balance Sheet that is
reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse Effect.

     3.10  Intellectual Property.

     (a) Right to Use. Autobytel has the right to use all Marks, Patents,
Copyrights and Software which are material to the operation of Autobytel's
business, free and clear of any and all liens, covenants, conditions and
restrictions or other adverse claims or interests of any kind or nature, and has
not received any written notice or claim challenging Autobytel's right to use
such Marks, Patents, Copyrights or Software, which in any case would be
reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse Effect.

     (b) Trade Secrets. Each of Merger Sub and Autobytel has taken reasonable
precautions in accordance with standard industry practice to protect the
secrecy, confidentiality and value of all material Trade Secrets of such Person
(collectively, "Autobytel Owned Trade Secrets"). Autobytel has the right to use
all of the Autobytel Owned Trade Secrets which are material to the operation of
Autobytel's business and none of the Autobytel Owned Trade Secrets is subject to
any liens, covenants, conditions and restrictions or other adverse claims or
interests of any kind or nature, and has not received any written notice or
claim challenging Autobytel's right to use any of the Autobytel Owned Trade
Secrets, which in any case would be reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse
Effect.

     (c) Software. To Autobytel's knowledge, Autobytel has lawfully acquired the
right to use the material Software used but not owned by Autobytel in the
conduct of its business (the "Autobytel Licensed Software") as it is used in the
conduct of its business as presently conducted, has not exercised any rights in
respect of any Autobytel Licensed Software, including any reproduction,
distribution or derivative work rights, outside the scope of any license
expressly granted by the Person from which the right to use such Autobytel
Licensed Software was obtained and has not received any written notice or claim
challenging Autobytel's right to use any of the Autobytel Licensed Software.

     (d) Infringement. Neither Merger Sub nor Autobytel is, nor has either
Person been, a party to any proceeding involving a claim of infringement,
misappropriation or other wrongful use or exploitation by Autobytel or Merger
Sub of any other Person's Intellectual Property Rights which has had, or is
reasonably likely to have, a Material Adverse Effect. Neither Merger Sub nor
Autobytel is, nor will such Person be as a result of the execution and delivery
of this Agreement or the performance of its obligations under this Agreement, in
breach of any license, sublicense or other agreement relating to its
Intellectual Property Rights which breach is reasonably likely to have a
Material Adverse Effect.

     (e) Confidentiality. Each of Merger Sub and Autobytel has taken reasonable
steps to protect its Intellectual Property Rights, i
