    Acquisition Corporation, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Credence, with and

[June   , 2001]

Dear Integrated Measurement Systems, Inc. Shareholders:

   On behalf of the board of directors of Integrated Measurement Systems, Inc.,
I am pleased to forward the enclosed proxy statement/prospectus regarding an
opportunity for Integrated Measurement Systems, Inc., or IMS, to be acquired by
Credence Systems Corporation, or Credence, by merging a subsidiary of Credence
with and into IMS. We believe the merger will strengthen the combined company's
product offerings, competitive position, management depth and research and
development capabilities, while offering significant value to our shareholders.

   If the merger with Credence is approved, each share of your IMS common stock
will be exchanged for 0.90 shares of Credence common stock (subject to
adjustment to reflect the effect of any stock split, stock dividend,
reorganization or similar change in Credence or IMS common stock). Credence
common stock is traded on the Nasdaq National Market under the trading symbol
"CMOS," and on June 4, 2001, Credence common stock closed at $21.69 per share.

   Before we can merge, the holders of 67% of IMS' outstanding common stock
must vote to approve the merger agreement. The merger proposal will be voted on
at a special meeting of IMS' shareholders on [    , 2001] at 10:00 a.m. local
time at the Courtyard by Marriott, 8500 S.W. Nimbus Avenue, Beaverton, Oregon
97008. Only those who hold shares of our common stock at the close of business
on June 7, 2001 will be entitled to vote at the special meeting.

   The IMS board of directors has carefully considered the terms and conditions
of the merger and has unanimously determined that the terms are fair to, and in
the best interests of, IMS shareholders. The board of directors has unanimously
adopted the merger agreement and approved the merger and unanimously recommends
that you vote FOR the approval of the merger agreement and the merger.

   This proxy statement/prospectus provides you with detailed information
concerning Credence and the merger. Please give all of the information in the
proxy statement/prospectus your careful attention. In particular, you should
carefully consider the discussion in the section entitled "Risk Factors"
beginning on page 13.

   YOUR VOTE IS VERY IMPORTANT. To approve the merger agreement, you must VOTE
FOR the proposal by following the instructions stated on the enclosed proxy
card. If you attend the special meeting, you may vote in person if you wish,
even though you have previously returned your proxy.

   Whether or not you plan to attend the special meeting, PLEASE COMPLETE,
SIGN, DATE AND PROMPTLY RETURN YOUR PROXY CARD IN THE ENCLOSED POSTAGE-PAID
ENVELOPE. If you fail to vote, it will, in effect, count as a vote against
approval of the merger.

   On behalf of the IMS board of directors, I thank you for your support and
urge you to VOTE FOR APPROVAL of the merger agreement among IMS, Credence and a
subsidiary of Credence.

                                          Sincerely,

                                          Keith L. Barnes
                                          Chief Executive Officer and Chairman

    Neither the Securities and Exchange Commission nor any state securities
 commission has approved or disapproved of this transaction or the Credence
 common stock to be issued in the merger or determined whether this proxy
 statement/prospectus is accurate or complete. Any representation to the
 contrary is a criminal offense.

 being mailed to IMS shareholders on or about [June   , 2001].

                          TO BE HELD [        , 2001]

                               ----------------

To the Shareholders of Integrated Measurement Systems, Inc.:

   We will hold a special meeting of shareholders of Integrated Measurement
Systems, Inc., or IMS, at 10:00 a.m. local time, on [            , 2001] at the
Courtyard by Marriott, 8500 S.W. Nimbus Avenue, Beaverton, Oregon 97008, for
the following purposes:

     1. To consider and vote on a proposal to approve the agreement and plan
  of merger and reorganization, dated May 16, 2001, as amended, by and among
  Credence Systems Corporation, Iguana Acquisition Corporation, a wholly-
  owned subsidiary of Credence, and IMS pursuant to which, among other
  things, Iguana Acquisition Corporation will merge with and into IMS and IMS
  will become a wholly-owned subsidiary of Credence. Under the agreement and
  plan of merger and reorganization, each outstanding share of IMS common
  stock will be converted into the right to receive 0.90 shares of Credence
  common stock (subject to adjustment to reflect the effect of any stock
  split, stock dividend, reorganization or similar change in Credence or IMS
  common stock).

     2. To transact such other business as may properly come before the
  special meeting.

   We describe these items of business more fully in the proxy
statement/prospectus attached to this notice. Please give all of the
information in the proxy statement/prospectus your careful attention.

   Only shareholders of record of IMS common stock at the close of business on
June 7, 2001 are entitled to notice of, and will be entitled to vote at, the
special meeting or any adjournment or postponement thereof. At the close of
business on such record date, IMS had outstanding and entitled to vote
[           ] shares of common stock.

   The IMS board of directors has carefully considered the terms and conditions
of the merger and has unanimously determined that the terms are fair to, and in
the best interests of, IMS shareholders. The board of directors has unanimously
adopted the agreement and plan of merger and approved the merger and
unanimously recommends that you vote FOR the approval of the merger agreement
and the merger.

   YOUR VOTE IS VERY IMPORTANT. Approval of the agreement and plan of merger
and reorganization will require the affirmative vote of the holders of IMS
common stock representing 67% of the outstanding shares of IMS common stock
entitled to vote at the special meeting. To assure that your shares are
represented at the special meeting, you are urged to complete, date, sign and
promptly return your proxy card in the enclosed postage-paid envelope whether
or not you plan to attend the special meeting in person. If you sign, date and
mail your proxy card without indicating how you wish to vote, your proxy will
be voted in favor of approval of the agreement and plan of merger. You may
revoke your proxy in the manner described in the accompanying proxy
statement/prospectus at any time before it has been voted at the special
meeting. Any shareholders attending the special meeting may revote his, her or
its proxy and vote in person.

                                          By Order of the Board of Directors

                                          Keith L. Barnes
                                          Chief Executive Officer and
                                          Chairman of the Board

Beaverton, Oregon
[June    , 2001]

              QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS ABOUT THE IMS/CREDENCE MERGER

Q: What will I receive in the merger?

A:  If the merger is completed, you will receive 0.90 shares of common stock
    of Credence Systems Corporation, or Credence, for each share of Integrated
    Measurement Systems, Inc., or IMS, common stock you own (subject to
    adjustment to reflect the effect of any stock split, stock dividend,
    reorganization or similar change in Credence or IMS common stock).
    Credence will not issue fractional shares of common stock. You will
    receive cash based on the market price of Credence common stock instead of
    any fractional share. Credence common stock is traded on the Nasdaq
    National Market under the trading symbol "CMOS," and on June 4, 2001,
    Credence common stock closed at $21.69 per share. Because the exchange
    ratio is fixed at 0.90 but the market price of Credence common stock is
    subject to fluctuation, the market value of the shares of Credence common
    stock that you will receive in the merger may increase or decrease prior
    to and following the merger. We urge you to obtain current market
    quotations for Credence and IMS common stock.

Q:  How will the merger affect IMS stock options?

A:  Options to purchase shares of IMS common stock will be assumed by Credence
    and become exercisable for shares of Credence common stock after the
    merger. The number of shares covered by these options, and their
    applicable exercise prices, will be adjusted using the merger exchange
    ratio of 0.90 of a share of Credence common stock for each share of IMS
    common stock that was subject to the applicable option prior to the merger
    (subject to adjustment to reflect the effect of any stock split, stock
    dividend, reorganization or similar change in IMS or Credence common
    stock).

Q:  Will IMS shareholders be able to trade the Credence stock they receive in
    the merger?

A:  Yes. All shares of Credence common stock received in the merger will be
    freely transferable unless you are considered an "affiliate" of IMS for
    purposes of the Securities Act. Persons who are deemed affiliates of IMS
    will be required to comply with Rules 144 and 145 under the Securities Act
    and the terms of their affiliate agreements with Credence which, in
    connection with accounting for the merger as a pooling-of-interests,
    require IMS' affiliates not to sell the shares of Credence common stock
    they receive in the merger from the date beginning 30 days prior to the
    completion of the merger until Credence releases earnings containing at
    least 30 days of earnings of the combined company.

Q:  When will the merger be completed?

A:  Subject to obtaining the necessary approval of IMS shareholders, we hope
    to complete the merger by the end of July 2001. Because the merger is
    subject to governmental approvals, however, we cannot predict the exact
    timing.

Q:  Are there risks I should consider in deciding whether to vote for the
    merger?

A:  Yes. We have set out in the section entitled "Risk Factors" beginning on
    page 13 of this proxy statement/prospectus a number of risk factors that
    you should consider in connection with the merger.

Q:  How do I vote?

A:  Mail your signed proxy card in the enclosed return envelope as soon as
    possible so that your shares may be represented at the special meeting. If
    your shares are held in "street name" by your broker, your broker will
    vote your shares only if you provide instructions to him or her on how to
    vote. You should follow the directions provided by your broker regarding
    how to instruct your broker to vote your shares. Without instructions,
    your shares will not be voted at the special meeting. If you do not vote
    your shares it will have the same effect as voting against approval of the
    merger agreement.

Q:  How can I change my vote after I have mailed my proxy?

A:  You may change your vote by delivering a signed notice of revocation or a
    subsequently dated, signed proxy card to IMS' corporate secretary before
    the shareholder meeting, or by attending the shareholder meeting and
    voting in person.

Q:  Should I send in my stock certificates now?

A:  No. After we complete the merger, Credence will send instructions to you
    explaining how to exchange your shares of IMS common stock for the
    appropriate number of shares of Credence common stock.

Q:  Do I have any dissenters' rights?

A:  No. Under Oregon law, you are not entitled to dissenters' rights in
    connection with the merger between IMS and Credence.

Q:  What are the tax consequences of the merger to me?

A:  We expect the merger will qualify as a "reorganization" for federal income
    tax purposes. If the merger qualifies as a reorganization, you generally
    will not recognize any gain or loss for federal income tax purposes upon
    the exchange of your IMS shares for shares of Credence common stock,
    although you will recognize taxable income with respect to any cash
    received in lieu of a fractional share of common stock. You should consult
    your own tax advisor regarding the tax consequences of the merger to you.
    For a more detailed description of the tax consequences of the merger, see
    the section of this proxy statement/prospectus entitled "The Merger and
    Related Transactions--Material Federal Income Tax Considerations"
    beginning on page 69.

Q:  Will there be any changes in my rights as a shareholder?

A:  Yes. As a shareholder of IMS, your rights are governed by IMS' amended and
    restated articles of incorporation and IMS' second restated bylaws. After
    completion of the merger, you will become a stockholder of Credence. As a
    Credence stockholder, your rights will be governed by Credence's amended
    and restated certificate of incorporation and Credence's bylaws. In
    addition, Credence is incorporated in Delaware while IMS is incorporated
    in Oregon. Although the rights and privileges of stockholders of a
    Delaware corporation are in many instances comparable to those of
    shareholders of an Oregon corporation, there are also differences. For a
    more detailed description of differences in your shareholder rights, see
    the section of this proxy statement/prospectus entitled "Comparison of
    Rights of Shareholders of IMS and Stockholders of Credence" beginning on
    page 72.

Q:  Is Credence stockholder approval required?

A:  No. Approval of the merger by Credence stockholders is not required. The
    board of directors of Credence has already adopted the merger agreement
    and approved the merger.

Q:  Whom can I call with questions?

A:  If you have any questions about the merger, please call IMS Investor
    Relations at (503) 626-5353.

CREDENCE SYSTEMS CORPORATION
215 Fourier Avenue
Fremont, California 94539
www.credence.com
(510) 657-7400

   Credence designs, manufactures, sells and services automatic test equipment,
or ATE, used for testing semiconductor integrated circuits, or ICs. Credence
also develops, licenses and distributes related software products. Credence
serves a broad spectrum of the semiconductor industry's testing needs through a
wide range of products that test digital logic, mixed-signal, non-volatile
memory and radio frequency semiconductors. Credence utilizes its proprietary
technologies to design products which are intended to provide a lower total
cost of ownership than many competing products currently available while
meeting the increasingly demanding performance requirements of today's ATE
market. Credence's products are primarily designed to test semiconductors that
are produced in high volume. Credence's customers include major semiconductor
manufacturers as well as assembly and test services companies. Credence was
incorporated in California in March 1982 to succeed to the business of a sole
proprietorship and was reincorporated in Delaware in October 1993.

INTEGRATED MEASUREMENT SYSTEMS, INC.
9525 S.W. Gemini Drive
Beaverton, Oregon 97008
www.ims.com
(503) 626-7117

   IMS designs, manufactures, markets and services versatile, high performance
IC validation systems. Customers use IMS' validation systems to test, at the
prototype stage, complex digital, mixed-signal and memory devices such as
microprocessors: application specific integrated circuits; multi-chip modules;
systems on chip integrated circuits; static random access memory; and dynamic
random access memory devices. In addition, IMS develops, markets and supports a
line of virtual test software that enables design and test engineers to develop
and debug production test software prior to fabricating the prototype of the
actual device. IMS' validation systems and software enable its customers to
refine their integrated circuit designs,

provide reliable and prompt feedback to both design and test engineers, reduce
cost of testing and shorten time-to-market. IMS markets and supports its
products worldwide through a network of direct sales force personnel,
independent distributors and dedicated sales personnel employed by affiliated
companies. IMS has sold over 1,000 validation systems to customers in the
semiconductor, aerospace, automotive, computer, consumer electronics, data
communications, medical electronics, telecommunications and other industries.

Structure of the Merger and Conversion of IMS Common Stock (see page 53)

   IMS and Credence have entered into a merger agreement that provides for the
merger of Iguana Acquisition Corporation, a newly formed wholly-owned
subsidiary of Credence, with and into IMS with IMS being the surviving
corporation. If the merger is completed, IMS will continue its operations as a
wholly-owned subsidiary of Credence.

   Upon completion of the merger, you will become entitled to receive 0.90 of a
share of Credence common stock in exchange for each share of IMS common stock
that you own at the time of completion of the merger, except that you will
receive cash in lieu of any fractional share of Credence common stock you would
otherwise be entitled to receive. We refer in this document to the 0.90 ratio
by which shares of Credence are to be exchanged in the merger for IMS common
stock as the "exchange ratio." A corresponding right to purchase shares of
Credence Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock, par value $0.001 per
share, pursuant to a Rights Agreement dated as of June 2, 1998 between Credence
and BankBoston, N.A. will accompany each share of Credence common stock issued
in the merger. We urge you to read Appendix A1 and Appendix A2 to this proxy
statement/prospectus, which together constitute the merger agreement, carefully
and in their entirety.

   The exchange ratio is fixed. Regardless of fluctuations in the market price
of Credence's or IMS' common stock, the exchange ratio will not change between
now and the date that the merger is completed (other than to reflect the effect
of any stock split, stock dividend, reorganization or similar change in
Credence or IMS common stock). Neither Credence nor IMS has the right to
terminate the merger agreement or renegotiate the exchange ratio solely as a
result of price fluctuations in the market for Credence and IMS common stock.
You are encouraged to obtain current market quotations of Credence and IMS
common stock.

Vote Required for Shareholder Approval (see page 38)

   The holders of 67% of the outstanding shares of IMS common stock must
approve the merger agreement. Credence stockholders are not required to approve
the merger agreement and will not vote on the merger.

   Cadence Design Systems, Inc., or Cadence, which owns approximately 32% of
the outstanding shares of IMS common stock as of the record date, has entered
into an amended and restated shareholder agreement with Credence (referred to
herein as the "shareholder agreement"), whereby Cadence is required to vote all
shares of IMS common stock beneficially owned by it in favor of approval of the
merger agreement and requires Cadence to vote against any other takeover
proposals. The shareholder agreement is attached to this proxy
statement/prospectus as Appendix B.

   You are entitled to cast one vote per share of IMS common stock you owned as
of June 7, 2001, the record date.

Recommendation of IMS' Board of Directors (see page 38)

   The IMS board of directors has carefully considered the terms and conditions
of the merger and has unanimously determined that the terms are fair to, and in
the best interests of, IMS shareholders. The board of

directors has unanimously adopted the merger agreement and approved the merger
and unanimously recommends that you vote FOR the approval of the merger
agreement and the merger.

Opinion of IMS' Financial Advisor (see page 45)

   SG Cowen Securities Corporation, or SG Cowen, IMS' financial advisor,
delivered an opinion to the IMS board of directors that, as of the date of the
opinion and based on the procedures followed, factors considered and
assumptions made by SG Cowen, and subject to the limitations set forth in the
opinion, the exchange ratio is fair, from a financial point of view, to the
shareholders of IMS. The complete opinion of SG Cowen is attached as Appendix C
to this proxy statement/prospectus. We urge you to read it in its entirety.

Reasons for the Merger (see page 42)

 Credence

   The board of directors of Credence has determined that the merger is in the
best interest of Credence and its stockholders, and has identified several
potential benefits, including:

  . a reduction in the volatility of Credence's business model;

  . complementary product lines;

  . potentially expanded customer usage model from design prototype
    validation to production test;

  . a broader potential Credence customer and relationship base;

  . a potentially expanded customer base geographically;

  . an enhanced Credence technology portfolio;

  . a stronger Credence virtual test product;

  . enhanced purchasing power with suppliers;

  . leverage of Credence's global salesforce; and

  . Credence's increased visibility in emerging markets and technologies.

 IMS

   The board of directors of IMS has determined that the terms of the merger
are fair to, and in the best interests, of IMS and its shareholders, and has
identified several potential benefits, including:

  . increased liquidity for IMS shareholders;

  . providing the combined company with an extensive design prototype
    validation to production test solution;

  . the opportunity to leverage scarce development funds by eliminating
    redundancy in the products or components developed;

  . enhanced purchasing power for components and technologies;

  . leveraging Credence's strong worldwide distribution network;

  . the premium, of approximately 58% based on the exchange ratio and the
    closing price of IMS stock on May 14, 2001, which IMS believes is a
    competitive premium for mergers and acquisitions within the semiconductor
    industry during the past year; and

  . the strength of Credence as a strong participant in the ATE market.

Conditions to the Merger (see page 58)

   Credence's and IMS' respective obligations to complete the merger and the
other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement are subject to the
prior satisfaction or waiver of a number of conditions. If either Credence or
IMS waives any conditions, IMS will consider the facts and circumstances at
that time and make a determination as to whether a resolicitation of proxies
from IMS shareholders is appropriate.

Termination of the Merger Agreement (See page 60)

   The merger agreement may be terminated at any time prior to completion of
the merger with the mutual agreement of IMS and Credence. Additionally, under
certain circumstances, which are described on page 60 of this proxy
statement/prospectus under the heading "Termination of the Merger Agreement,"
either Credence or IMS may be entitled to unilaterally terminate the merger
agreement. Termination may result in the obligation to reimburse the other
party for out of pocket expenses, or result in payment of a termination fee, as
described herein.

Payment of Termination Fees and Expenses (see page 62)

   IMS is required to pay Credence termination fees of up to $8,000,000 under
certain circumstances, which are described on page 62 of this proxy
statement/prospectus under the heading "Payment of Termination Fees and
Expenses." In addition, under certain circumstances, IMS is required to
reimburse Credence for its out-of-pocket expenses of up to $1,000,000.

   Credence has agreed to reimburse IMS for its out-of-pocket expenses of up to
$1,000,000 if the merger agreement is terminated under certain circumstances,
which are described on page 62 of this proxy statement/prospectus under the
heading "Payment of Termination Fees and Expenses."

No Solicitation of Transactions (see page 64)

   IMS has agreed, among other restrictions described in this proxy
statement/prospectus on page 64 under the heading "No Solicitation of
Transactions," that it will not discuss or negotiate or otherwise solicit,
initiate, encourage, facilitate or enter into any agreement with respect to a
business combination or similar transaction with another party while the merger
is still pending.

   IMS may, subject to limitations described in this proxy statement/prospectus
under the heading "No Solicitation of Transactions," engage in negotiations or
discussions or disclose nonpublic information in response to an unsolicited
written offer for a business combination with, or a tender offer for IMS, or an
acquisition of a significant portion of the assets of IMS, or an acquisition of
15% or more of any class of securities of IMS; provided, that the board of
directors of IMS:

  . determines, after consultation with its financial advisors, that such
    offer is more favorable to the shareholders of IMS from a financial point
    of view than the merger; and

  . determines in good faith, after consultation with outside legal counsel,
    that it is necessary for the board in order to comply with its fiduciary
    duties to the shareholders of IMS.

A Shareholder Holding Approximately 32% of IMS' Common Stock Has Entered into a
Shareholder Agreement Requiring It to Vote in Favor of the Merger (see page 66)

   Cadence has entered into a shareholder agreement with Credence which
requires Cadence to vote all shares of IMS common stock beneficially owned by
it in favor of approval of the merger agreement and requires Cadence to vote
against any other takeover proposals. The shareholder agreement also requires

Cadence to deliver an irrevocable proxy to Credence. The irrevocable proxy
enables Credence to vote Cadence's shares to approve the merger and enables
Credence to vote Cadence's shares against any other takeover proposals.

   The shares of IMS common stock subject to the shareholder agreement
represent approximately 32% of the outstanding IMS common stock as of the
record date.

   Credence and IMS urge you to read the form of amended and restated
shareholder agreement attached as Appendix B to this proxy statement/prospectus
in its entirety.

Interests of IMS' Directors, Officers and Affiliates in the Merger (see page
67)

   When considering the recommendation of the IMS board of directors, you
should be aware that certain IMS directors, officers and affiliates have
interests in the merger that are different from, or in addition to, yours. As a
result, IMS' directors, officers and affiliates may be more likely to vote to
approve the merger agreement than IMS shareholders generally. As of June 4,
2001, directors and executive officers of IMS and affiliates (including
Cadence) held approximately 34% of the outstanding shares of IMS common stock
entitled to vote. To approve the merger agreement, the holders of 67% of the
outstanding shares of IMS common stock must vote for approval. A description of
additional interests of officers and directors that may be different from, or
in addition to, yours can be found on page 67 of this proxy
statement/prospectus under the heading "Interests of IMS' Directors, Officers
and Affiliates in the Merger."

Material Federal Income Tax Considerations of the Merger (see page 69)

   The exchange of shares of IMS common stock for Credence common stock in the
merger is intended to be tax-free to IMS shareholders for federal income tax
purposes, except to the extent of cash received by IMS shareholders in respect
of fractional shares. It is a condition to the merger that each of Credence and
IMS receive a legal opinion from their respective tax counsel to the effect
that the merger will constitute a reorganization within the meaning of the
Internal Revenue Code. TAX MATTERS CAN BE COMPLICATED AND THE TAX CONSEQUENCES
OF THE MERGER TO YOU WILL DEPEND ON THE FACTS OF YOUR OWN SITUATION. YOU SHOULD
CONSULT YOUR OWN TAX ADVISOR TO FULLY UNDERSTAND THE TAX CONSEQUENCES OF THE
MERGER TO YOU.

Accounting Treatment of the Merger (see page 71)

   Credence intends to account for the merger as a pooling of interests
business combination and Credence and IMS have agreed to use their reasonable
best efforts to cause the merger to be accounted for in this manner.
Additionally, IMS has agreed to use its reasonable best efforts to obtain from
its accountants, Arthur Andersen LLP, confirmation that IMS qualifies as a
party to a merger to be accounted for as a pooling of interests business
combination. Although Credence intends to account for the merger as a pooling
of interests business combination, that accounting treatment is not, of itself,
a condition to completion of the merger.

Antitrust Approval Required to Complete the Merger (see page 69)

   The merger is subject to United States antitrust laws. Credence and IMS
expect to make the required filings with the United States Department of
Justice and the Federal Trade Commission. However, Credence and IMS are not
permitted to complete the merger until the applicable waiting period has
expired or terminated.

   In addition, Credence and IMS may need to obtain approval for the merger in
foreign jurisdictions depending upon the extent to which IMS and/or Credence
conduct business in these jurisdictions and the statutory requirements of each
of these jurisdictions.

Restrictions on the Ability to Sell Credence Stock (see page 71)

   All shares of Credence common stock received by you in connection with the
merger will be freely transferable unless you are considered an "affiliate" of
IMS for purposes of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Securities
Act. Shares of Credence common stock held by these affiliates may only be sold
pursuant to a registration statement or exemption under the Securities Act.
Credence has offered limited registration rights to parties who may be deemed
to be affiliates of IMS which may be utilized if those affiliates are unable to
sell their shares of Credence common stock acquired in the merger under Rules
144 and 145 under the Securities Act. In addition, in connection with
accounting for the merger as a pooling-of-interests, IMS' affiliates will not
be able to sell the shares of Credence common stock received in the merger from
the date beginning 30 days prior to the completion of the merger until Credence
releases earnings containing at least 30 days of earnings of the combined
company.

You Do Not Have Dissenters' Rights (see page 71)

   Under Oregon law, you are not entitled to dissenters' rights in the merger.

Forward-Looking Statements in This Proxy Statement/Prospectus

   This proxy statement/prospectus and the documents incorporated by reference
into this proxy statement/prospectus contain forward-looking statements within
the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 with
respect to Credence's and IMS' financial condition, results of operations and
business and on the expected impact of the merger on Credence's financial
performance. Examples of forward-looking statements include statements
regarding Credence's or IMS' future financial results, operating results,
business strategies, projected costs, competitive position, and plans and
objectives of management for future operations. Words like "may," "will,"
"should," "would," "predicts," "potential," "continue," "anticipates,"
"expects," "intends," "plans," "believes," "seeks," "estimates" and the
negative of these terms or other comparable terminology are intended to
identify forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are not
guarantees of future performance and are subject to risks and uncertainties,
including those discussed in the Risk Factors, that could cause actual results
to differ materially from the results contemplated by the forward-looking
statements. These and many other factors could affect the future financial and
operating results of Credence or IMS. In evaluating the merger, you should
carefully consider the discussion of certain risks and uncertainties in the
section entitled "Risk Factors" on page 13 of this proxy statement/prospectus
and in the documents incorporated by reference in this proxy
statement/prospectus.

(A) Net income, basic earnings per share and diluted earnings per share for
    1998, before nonrecurring acquisition and restructuring charges, were $0.1

(B) Effective January 1, 2000, IMS changed its method of accounting for systems
    revenue based on guidance provided in SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin No.
    101, "Revenue Recognition in Financial Statements," (SAB 101).

(C) The Unaudited Pro Forma Combined Per Share Data combines financial
    information of Credence for the fiscal years ended October 31, 1998,
    October 31, 1999 and October 31, 2000 and the three months ended January
    31, 2000 and January 31, 2001 with the financial information of IMS for the
    fiscal years ended December 31, 1998, December 31, 1999 and December 31,
    2000 and the three months ended March 31, 2000 and 2001, respectively. This
    information which is unaudited also assumes the merger occurred as of the
    beginning of the earliest period presented and was accounted for as a
    pooling of interests.

(D) The Unaudited Pro Forma Combined Per Share Data is presented on a pre-SAB
    101 basis for IMS. During the fourth fiscal quarter of 2001, the combined
    company will record the cumulative effect of SAB 101 at November 1, 2000
    and will restate all four quarters of fiscal 2001 for the effect of SAB
    101.

(E) The unaudited equivalent IMS pro forma per share amounts are calculated by
    multiplying the Credence combined pro forma per share amounts by the
    exchange ratio.

(F) The historical book value per share is computed by dividing stockholders'
    equity by the number of shares of common stock outstanding at the end of
    the applicable period. The pro forma combined book value per share is
    computed by dividing pro forma stockholders' equity by the pro forma number
    of shares of the combined company's common stock outstanding at the end of
    the applicable period.

Recent Closing Prices

   As of May 16, 2001, the last trading day before announcement of the proposed
merger, the closing prices per share of Credence common stock and IMS common
stock on the Nasdaq National Market were $24.76 and $12.81, respectively. On
[June     , 2001], the latest practicable trading day before the printing of
this proxy statement/prospectus, the closing prices per share of Credence
common stock and IMS common stock on the Nasdaq National Market were $[      ]
and $[       ], respectively. The equivalent per share prices for IMS common
stock based on the Credence common stock prices multiplied by the exchange
ratio of 0.90 were $22.28 as of May 16, 2001 and $[      ] as of [June     ,
2001].

   Because the exchange ratio is fixed at 0.90 but the market price of Credence
common stock is subject to fluctuation, the market value of the shares of
Credence common stock that holders of IMS common stock will receive in the
merger may increase or decrease prior to and following the merger. We urge you
to obtain current market quotations for Credence and IMS common stock. No
assurance can be given as to the future prices or markets for Credence or IMS
common stock.

Number of IMS Shareholders

   As of close of business on June 7, 2001, there were approximately [     ] of

                                  RISK FACTORS

   By voting in favor of the merger agreement and the merger, you will be
choosing to invest in Credence common stock. An investment in Credence common
stock involves a high degree of risk. In addition to the other information
contained in or incorporated by reference into this proxy statement/prospectus,
you should carefully consider the following risk factors in deciding whether to
vote for the merger.

                          Risks Related to the Merger

   Under this section entitled "--Risks Related to the Merger," use of the term
"combined company" refers to the Credence group of companies after completion
of the merger, including IMS.

You will receive 0.90 shares of Credence common stock for each share of IMS
common stock owned despite changes in market value of IMS common stock or
Credence common stock.

   Upon completion of the merger, each share of IMS common stock will be
exchanged for 0.90 shares of Credence common stock (subject to adjustment to
reflect the effect of any stock split, stock dividend, reorganization or
similar change in Credence or IMS common stock). There will be no adjustment to
the exchange ratio based on changes in the market price of either IMS common
stock or Credence common stock. Accordingly, the specific dollar value of
Credence common stock to be received by you upon completion of the merger will
depend on the market value of Credence common stock at the time of completion
of the merger. The share price of Credence common stock is by its nature
subject to the general price fluctuations in the market for publicly traded
equity securities and has experienced significant volatility. See "Risk
Factors--Risks Relating to Credence" below. No prediction can be made as to the
market price of Credence common stock at the completion of the merger or as to
the market price of Credence common stock after the completion of the merger.

Although Credence and IMS expect that the merger will result in benefits, those
benefits may not be realized.

   Credence and IMS entered into the merger agreement with the expectation that
the merger will result in benefits to the combined company, but those benefits
may not be fully realized. See the section entitled "The Merger and Related
Transactions--Reasons for the Merger" for a discussion of some of the
anticipated benefits of the merger.

   Achieving the benefits of the merger will depend in part on the integration
of the technology, operations and personnel of the two companies in a timely
and efficient manner so as to minimize the risk that the merger will result in
the loss of customers or key employees. Such integration efforts are difficult
and the results are unpredictable in light of the possible cultural,
organizational and operational differences between Credence and IMS.
Integration efforts can also be expected to require the diversion of
significant management attention and resources. Such diversion of attention
could have an adverse effect on the combined company during such transition
period.

   In addition, integrating IMS' product line into Credence's business model
will involve risks that may jeopardize the success of the combined company.
Integration of the IMS technology and products will result in significant
expansion of Credence's participation in the high performance integrated
circuit validation systems market, will involve considerable risks and may or
may not be successful. For the potential benefits of the merger to be fully
realized, Credence will have to learn to satisfy the needs of customers in this
market in a timely and efficient manner. Credence and IMS cannot, therefore,
assure you that IMS will be successfully integrated into Credence or that any
of the anticipated benefits will be realized, and failure to do so could have a
material adverse effect on the combined company's business, financial condition
and operating results and on the price of Credence's common stock.

IMS officers and directors have conflicts of interest that may influence them
to support or approve the merger.

   The directors and officers of IMS participate in arrangements and have
continuing indemnification against liabilities that provide them with interests
in the merger that are different from, or are in addition to, yours including
the following:

  . As of June 4, 2001, directors and executive officers of IMS and
    affiliates (including Cadence) held approximately 34% of the outstanding
    shares of IMS common stock entitled to vote.

  . As of June 4, 2001, directors and executive officers of IMS held stock
    options, both vested and unvested, to purchase an aggregate of 1,313,747
    shares of IMS common stock under the 1995 Stock Incentive Plan and the
    1995 Stock Option Plan for Non-Employee Directors. If the merger is
    completed, approximately 39% of that total, consisting of the options to
    purchase 505,935 shares held by Keith L. Barnes, Donald E. Grant and Fred
    Hall, will accelerate and become fully vested and exercisable immediately
    pursuant to terms of their existing employment agreements, without any
    action by IMS or Credence.

  . As a condition to the merger, six of the seven current IMS directors must
    resign from the board of directors upon completion of the merger. All six
    of those directors are outside directors and have existing director
    consulting and indemnity agreements with IMS that obligate IMS to engage
    the director as a consultant. The aggregate number of shares subject to
    unvested options for all six outside directors is 74,440. Please see the
    section entitled "Interests of IMS Directors, Officers and Affiliates in
    the Merger" on page 67 of this proxy statement/prospectus.

  . Two officers of IMS, W. Barry Baril, Chief Technical Officer, and Gwyn
    Harvey, Vice President of Human Resources, have existing employment
    agreements that provide that in the event such officer's employment is
    terminated without cause within one year after a sale of a majority of
    the voting stock of IMS, then the vesting of IMS options held by the
    officer will be accelerated. If the employment of Mr. Baril or Ms. Harvey
    were to be terminated without cause within one year from completion of
    the merger, their unvested options totaling, as of June 4, 2001, 56,246
    shares and 22,227 shares, respectively, will immediately vest and become
    exercisable.

  . Following completion of the merger, Credence intends to grant an
    aggregate of 250,000 options to purchase shares of Credence common stock
    to certain employees of IMS, including certain of its executive officers.
    Please see the section entitled "Interests of IMS Directors, Officers and
    Affiliates in the Merger" on page 67 of the proxy statement prospectus.

  . The merger agreement provides for the continuation of indemnification
    arrangements in favor of directors and officers of IMS for their acts and
    omissions occurring prior to the completion of the merger. Please see the
    section entitled "Indemnification of Officers and Directors and Liability
    Insurance" on page 67 of this proxy statement/prospectus.

   In addition, the merger agreement provides that for a period of six years
after the completion of the merger, the surviving corporation will maintain,
for the benefit of the directors and officers of IMS at the time of completion
of the merger with respect to their acts and omissions in their capacities as
directors and officers of IMS occurring prior to completion of the merger,
directors' and officers' liability insurance on terms comparable to those
maintained by IMS as of the date of the merger agreement.

   As of June 4, IMS' officers, directors and affiliates (including Cadence)
held approximately 2,675,865 shares of IMS common stock, excluding options to
purchase IMS common stock which were unexercised as of the record date, which
represented approximately 34% of all outstanding shares of IMS common stock
entitled to vote. See the section entitled "Interests of IMS Directors,
Officers and Affiliates in the Merger" beginning on page 67 of this proxy
statement/prospectus.

   As a result, these directors and officers may be more likely to vote to
approve the merger agreement than if they did not hold these interests. IMS
expects all of its directors and officers to vote for approval of the

merger agreement. IMS shareholders should consider whether these interests may
have influenced these directors and officers to support or recommend the
merger.

Failure to complete the merger could negatively impact IMS' stock price and
future business and operations.

   If the merger is not completed for any reason, IMS may be subject to a
number of material risks, including the following:

  . IMS may be required to pay Credence a termination fee and reimburse
    Credence for its out-of-pocket expenses if the merger agreement is
    terminated under certain circumstances;

  . relationships with customers and suppliers may be adversely effected;

  . the price of IMS' common stock may decline to the extent that the current
    market price of IMS common stock reflects a market assumption that the
    merger will be completed; and

  . costs related to the merger, such as legal, accounting and financial
    advisor fees, must be paid even if the merger is not completed.

   In addition, IMS customers may, in response to the announcement of the
merger, defer or cancel pending purchases, delay purchasing decisions, or
decline to make future purchases from IMS. Any of these actions by IMS
customers could have a material adverse effect on IMS' business, regardless of
whether or not the merger is ultimately completed. Similarly, current and
prospective IMS employees may experience uncertainty about their future role
with Credence until Credence's strategies with regard to IMS are announced or
executed. This may adversely affect IMS' ability to attract and retain, and may
affect the performance during the transition period of, key management, sales,
marketing and technical personnel.

   Further, if the merger is terminated and IMS' board of directors determines
to seek another merger or business combination, there can be no assurance that
it will be able to find a partner willing to pay an equivalent or more
attractive price than that which would be paid in the merger. In addition,
while the merger agreement is in effect, and subject to certain limited
exceptions described on page 64 of this proxy statement/prospectus, IMS is
prohibited from soliciting, initiating or encouraging or entering into certain
extraordinary transactions, such as a merger, sale of assets or other business
combination, with any party other than Credence, without the prior written
consent of Credence.

Customer, supplier and employee uncertainty related to the merger could harm
the combined company.

   Credence and IMS customers and suppliers, may, in response to the
announcement or consummation of the merger, delay purchasing or supply
decisions or otherwise alter existing relationships with Credence and IMS.
These decisions or other adverse changes in business relationships of Credence
and IMS with their customers and suppliers could adversely affect the business
of the combined company. Similarly, current and prospective IMS employees may
experience uncertainty about their future as employees of the combined company
until or after strategies with regard to IMS are announced or executed. This
may adversely affect Credence's or IMS' ability to attract and retain, and may
affect the performance during the transition period of, key management,
marketing and technical personnel. Credence has not entered into employment
agreements with any IMS employees in connection with the merger and, therefore,
cannot be certain that it will be able to retain any such employees.

The price of Credence common stock may be affected by factors different from
those affecting the price of IMS common stock.

   When the merger is completed, holders of IMS common stock will become
holders of Credence common stock. Credence's business differs from that of IMS,
and Credence's results of operations, as well as the price of Credence common
stock, may be affected by factors different from those affecting IMS' results
of operations and the price of IMS common stock.

We may be unable to obtain the required regulatory approvals for completing the
merger.

   As a condition to the obligations of Credence and IMS to complete the
merger, the waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements
Act of 1976, as amended, or the HSR Act, must have expired or been terminated.
There can be no assurance that the waiting period under the HSR Act will be
permitted to expire or be terminated at all or without materially adverse
restrictions or conditions that would have an adverse effect on the combined
company. In addition, the merger may be subject to various foreign antitrust
laws, some of which may require us to make filings with foreign antitrust
authorities. The combined company may be required to agree to various operating
restrictions, before or after receipt of shareholder approval, in order to
obtain the necessary authorizations and approvals of the merger or to assure
that governmental authorities do not seek to block the merger. There is no
assurance that Credence and IMS will agree to such restrictions. If Credence
and IMS do not agree to these restrictions the merger may not be completed. No
additional shareholder approval is expected to be required or sought for any
decision by Credence or IMS, after the special meeting of IMS' shareholders, to
agree to any terms and conditions necessary to resolve any regulatory
objections to the merger, and shareholder approval will not be sought unless
such shareholder approval is required under applicable law. If any agreements
regarding operating restrictions are required under applicable law or by
governmental authorities, under the terms of the merger agreement neither
Credence nor IMS is obligated to agree to the divestiture of any assets or
business units, unless Credence and IMS mutually agree it is in their
respective best interests to do so. Even if regulatory approvals are obtained,
any federal, state or foreign governmental entity or any private person may
challenge the merger at any time before or after its completion.

The merger may fail to qualify as a reorganization, resulting in your
recognition of taxable gain or loss in respect of your IMS shares.

   Credence and IMS intend the merger to qualify as a reorganization within the
meaning of Section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code. Although the Internal
Revenue Service, or IRS, has not provided a ruling on the matter, each of
Credence and IMS will, as a condition to closing, obtain a legal opinion from
their respective tax counsel that the merger will constitute a reorganization
for federal income tax purposes. These opinions do not bind the IRS or prevent
the IRS from adopting a contrary position. If the merger fails to qualify as a
reorganization you generally would recognize gain or loss on each share of IMS
common stock surrendered in an amount equal to the difference between your
adjusted tax basis in that share and the sum of the amount of cash, if any, and
the fair market value of the Credence common stock received in exchange for
that share upon completion of the merger.

The merger may not be able to be accounted for as a pooling of interests
business combination.

   Although Credence intends to account for the merger as a pooling of
interests business combination, such accounting method may not be available.
Failure to account for the merger as a pooling of interests business
combination could have a material adverse effect on the financial results of
Credence.

There may be increased competition against IMS' business as a result of the
merger with Credence.

   After the merger, the level of competition encountered by the combined
company may increase. A number of IMS' current customers and partners are
competitors of Credence. As a result of the merger, these customers or partners
may choose to no longer do business, or may choose to reduce their business,
with the combined company and may instead enter IMS' business as a direct
competitor to the combined company. Many of these competitors have significant
financial, marketing, manufacturing and technological resources. If any of
these current customers, or other potential competitors, introduces a virtual
test product, it could harm the business of the combined company.

IMS may lose certain strategic relationships as a result of the merger with
Credence.

   IMS currently has many strategic relationships with vendors of ATE machines.
Many of these relationships are with competitors of Credence. Maintaining close
working relationships with these strategic partners is important to IMS'
business. As a result of the merger, these strategic partners may no longer do
business, or may reduce or impose additional conditions on their business, with
the combined company. For example, Agilent Technologies, Inc., or Agilent, has
provided notice to IMS that it is cancelling an agreement it had in place with
IMS. This agreement provides that if IMS consummates a transaction with a
competitor of Agilent, Agilent may become entitled, under certain
circumstances, to obtain IMS source codes deposited with Agilent in order to
support the technology covered by the Agreement for a period of five years. The
inability to maintain, or any other adverse change to, such strategic
relationships could have a material adverse effect on the combined company's
business, financial condition and operating results.

Our operating results may fluctuate significantly which may adversely affect
our stock price.

   A variety of factors affect our results of operations. The above graph
illustrates that our quarterly net sales and operating results have fluctuated
significantly. We believe they will continue to fluctuate for several reasons,
including:

  . economic conditions in the semiconductor industry in general and capital
    equipment industry specifically;

  . manufacturing capacity and ability to volume produce systems, including
    our newest systems, and meet customer requirements;

  . timing of new product announcements and new product releases by us or our
    competitors;

  . market acceptance of our new products and enhanced versions of existing
    products;

  . manufacturing inefficiencies associated with the start-up of our new
    products, changes in our pricing or payment terms and cycles, and those
    of our competitors, customers and suppliers;

  . write-offs of excess and obsolete inventories and accounts receivable
    that are not collectible;

  . supply constraints;

  . ability to obtain adequate facilities;

  . patterns of capital spending by our customers, delays, cancellations or
    reschedulings of customer orders due to customer financial difficulties
    or otherwise;

  . changes in overhead absorption levels due to changes in the number of
    systems manufactured, the timing and shipment of orders, availability of
    components including custom ICs, subassemblies and services,
    customization and reconfiguration of our systems and product reliability;

  . expenses associated with acquisitions and alliances;

  . operating expense reductions associated with cyclical industry downturns,
    including costs relating to facilities consolidations and related
    expenses;

  . the proportion of our direct sales and sales through third parties,
    including distributors and OEMS, the mix of products sold, the length of
    manufacturing and sales cycles, and product discounts;

  . natural disasters, political and economic instability, currency
    fluctuations, regulatory changes and outbreaks of hostilities; and

  . our ability to hire and retain qualified employees in a competitive
    market.

   We intend to introduce new products and product enhancements in the future,
the timing and success of which will affect our business, financial condition
and results of operations. Our gross margins on system sales have varied
significantly and will continue to vary significantly based on a variety of
factors including:

  . manufacturing inefficiencies;

  . pricing concessions by us and our competitors and pricing by our
    suppliers;

  . hardware and software product sales mix;

  . inventory write-downs;

  . production volumes;

  . new product introductions;

  . product reliability;

  . absorption levels and the rate of capacity utilization;

  . customization and reconfiguration of systems;

  . international and domestic sales mix and field service margins; and

  . facility relocations and expansions.

   New and enhanced products typically have lower gross margins in the early
stages of commercial introduction and production. Although we have recorded and
continue to record provisions for estimated sales allowances and price
adjustments, accounts receivable that might not be collectible, and product
warranty costs, we cannot be certain that our estimates will be adequate.

   We cannot forecast with any certainty the impact of these and other factors
on our sales and operating results in any future period. Results of operations
in any period, therefore, should not be considered indicative of the results to
be expected for any future period. Because of this difficulty in predicting
future performance, our operating results may fall below the expectations of
securities analysts or investors in some future quarter or quarters. Our
failure to meet these expectations would likely adversely affect the market
price of our common stock. In addition, our need for continued significant
expenditures for research and development, marketing and other expenses for new
products, capital equipment purchases and worldwide training and customer
service and support will impact our sales and operations results in the future.
Other significant expenditures may make it difficult for us to reduce our
significant fixed expenses in a particular period if we do not meet our net
sales goals for that period. These other expenditures include:

  . research and development;

  . support costs for the distribution channels;

  . marketing and other expenses for new products;

  . capital equipment purchases and world-wide training; and

  . customer support and service.

   As a result, we cannot be certain that we will be profitable in the future.

We have a limited backlog and obtain most of our net sales from a relatively
few number of system sales transactions, which can result in fluctuations of
quarterly results.

   Other than some memory products and software products, for which the price
range is typically below $50,000, we obtain most of our net sales from the sale
of a relatively few number of systems that typically range in price from
$350,000 to $2.5 million. This has resulted and could continue to result in our
net sales and operating results for a particular period being significantly
impacted by the timing of recognition of revenue from a single transaction. Our
net sales and operating results for a particular period could also be
materially adversely affected if an anticipated order from just one customer is
not received in time to permit shipment during that period. Backlog at the
beginning of a quarter typically does not include all orders necessary to
achieve our sales objectives for that quarter. Orders in backlog are subject to
cancellation, delay, deferral or rescheduling by customers with limited or no
penalties. In the first half of fiscal 2001, we experienced customer-requested
shipment delays and order cancellations, and we believe it is probable that
orders will be canceled in the future. Consequently, our quarterly net sales
and operating results have in the past and will in the future, depend upon our
obtaining orders for systems to be shipped in the same quarter in which the
order is received.

   We believe that some of our customers may, from time to time, place orders
with us for more systems than they will ultimately require, or they will order
a more rapid delivery than they will ultimately require. For this reason, our
backlog may include customer orders in excess of those actually delivered to
them or other customers.

   Furthermore, we generally ship products generating most of our net sales
near the end of each quarter. Accordingly, our failure to receive an
anticipated order or a delay or rescheduling in a shipment near the end of a
particular period may cause net sales in a particular period to fall
significantly below expectations, which could have a material adverse effect on
our business, financial condition or results of operations. The relatively long
manufacturing cycle of many of our testers has caused and could continue to
cause future shipments of testers to be delayed from one quarter to the next.
Furthermore, as we and our competitors announce new products and technologies,
customers may defer or cancel purchases of our existing systems. We cannot
forecast the impact of these and other factors on our sales and operating
results.

The semiconductor industry has been cyclical.

   Revenue growth has slowed in the test and assembly sector of the
semiconductor equipment industry during what we now believe is a cyclical
downturn in the industry. There is uncertainty as to if and when the next
cyclical growth phase will occur. This belief is based on weakening order
activity, order cancellation activity, and customer-requested shipment delays
from our existing backlog. This business weakness is worldwide but we see it in
particular with customers in Asia. Until such time as we return to a growth
period, we expect a continuing decline in orders and therefore expect that the
July 31, 2001 fiscal quarter's revenue will decline from the levels we
experienced during the second quarter of fiscal 2001. In light of that belief,
we reduced our worldwide workforce by approximately 21%, or 300 people. We took
a charge related to this reduction in force of approximately $2 million in our
second fiscal quarter of 2001. Additionally, all remaining employees will be
required to take eight days of time off per quarter through July 2001. Other
initiatives, including a domestic pay cut, the consolidation and reorganization
of certain functions and operations, and the curtailment of discretionary
expenses, are also being implemented. If we continue to reduce our workforce,
it may adversely impact our ability to respond rapidly to any renewed growth
opportunities in the future.

   Our business and results of operations depend largely upon the capital
expenditures of manufacturers of semiconductors and companies that specialize
in contract packaging and/or testing of semiconductors. This includes
manufacturers and contractors that are opening new or expanding existing
fabrication facilities or upgrading existing equipment, which in turn depend
upon the current and anticipated market demand for semiconductors and products
incorporating semiconductors. The semiconductor industry has been highly
cyclical with recurring periods of oversupply, which often has had a severe
effect on the semiconductor industry's demand for test equipment, including the
systems we manufacture and market. We believe that the markets for newer
generations of semiconductors will also be subject to similar fluctuations.

   We have experienced shipment delays, delays in commitments and restructured
purchase orders by customers and we expect this activity to continue.
Accordingly, we cannot be certain that we will be able to achieve or maintain
our current or prior level of sales or rate of growth. In addition, sales are
expected to be sequentially down in the next fiscal quarter and possibly in the
upcoming quarters. We anticipate that a significant portion of new orders may
depend upon demand from semiconductor device manufacturers building or
expanding fabrication facilities and new device testing requirements that are
not addressable by currently installed test equipment, and there can be no
assurance that such demand will develop to a significant degree, or at all. In
addition, our business, financial condition or results of operations may be
adversely affected by any factor adversely affecting the semiconductor industry
in general or particular segments within the semiconductor industry. For
example, the 1997/1998 Asian financial crisis contributed to widespread
uncertainty and, in part, a slowdown in the semiconductor industry. This
slowdown in the semiconductor industry resulted in reduced spending for
semiconductor capital equipment, including ATE which we sell. This industry
slowdown had, and similar slowdowns may in the future have, a material adverse
effect on our product backlog, balance sheet, financial condition and results
of operations. Therefore, there can be no assurance that our operating results
will not be materially adversely affected if downturns or slowdowns in the
semiconductor industry occur again in the future.

Over the last several years we have experienced significant fluctuations in our
operating results and an increased scale of operations.

   In the first half of fiscal 2001 our net sales fell 35% from the same period
in fiscal 2000 as the industry began a cyclical downturn. In fiscal 2000, we
generated revenue of $101.8 million in the first quarter and $220.2 million in
the fourth quarter, an increase of 116%. In fiscal 1999, we generated revenue
of $26.5 million in the first quarter and $80.2 million in the fourth quarter,
an increase of 203%. In fiscal 1998, we generated revenue of $82.4 million for
the first quarter and $22.4 million for the fourth quarter, a decrease of 73%.
Since 1993, except for the current cost-cutting efforts and those during fiscal
1998 and most of fiscal 1999, we have overall significantly increased the scale
of our operations in general to support periods of generally increased sales
levels and expanded product offerings and have expanded operations to address
critical infrastructure and other requirements, including the hiring of
additional personnel, significant investments in research and development to
support product development, acquisition of the new facilities in Oregon,
further investments in our ERP system and numerous acquisitions. These
fluctuations in our sales and operations have placed and are placing a
considerable strain on our management, financial, manufacturing and other
resources. In order to effectively deal with the changes brought on by the
cyclical nature of the industry, we have been required to implement and improve
a variety of highly flexible operating, financial and other systems, procedures
and controls capable of expanding, or contracting consistent with our business.
However, we cannot be certain that any existing or new systems, procedures or
controls, including our ERP system, will be adequate to support fluctuations in
our operations or that our systems, procedures and controls will be cost-
effective or timely. Any failure to implement, improve and expand or contract
such systems, procedures and controls efficiently and at a pace consistent with
our business could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial
condition or results of operations.

We are expanding and intend to continue the expansion of our product lines.

   We are currently devoting and intend to continue to devote significant
resources to the development, production and commercialization of new products
and technologies. In late fiscal 1999 and into 2000, we shipped three major new
products. We invested and continue to invest significant resources in plant and
equipment, leased facilities, inventory, personnel and other costs to begin or
prepare to increase production of these products. A significant portion of
these investments will provide the marketing, administration and after-sales
service and support required for these new hardware and software products.
Accordingly, we cannot be certain that gross profit margin and inventory levels
will not be adversely impacted by delays in new product introductions or start-
up costs associated with the initial production and installation of these new
product lines. We also cannot be certain that we can manufacture these systems
per the time and quantity required by our customers. The start-up costs include
additional manufacturing overhead, additional inventory and warranty reserve
requirements and the enhancement of after-sales service and support
organizations. In addition, the increases in inventory on hand for new product
development and customer support requirements have increased and will continue
to increase the risk of inventory write-offs. We cannot be certain that our net
sales will increase or remain at recent levels or that any new products will be
successfully commercialized or contribute to revenue growth or that any of our
additional costs will be covered.

There are limitations on our ability to find the supplies and services
necessary to run our business.

   We obtain certain components, subassemblies and services necessary for the
manufacture of our testers from a limited group of suppliers. We do not
maintain long-term supply agreements with most of our vendors and we purchase
most of our components and subassemblies through individual purchase orders.
The manufacture of certain of our components and subassemblies is an extremely
complex process. We also rely on outside vendors to manufacture certain
components and subassemblies and to provide certain services. We have recently
experienced and continue to experience significant reliability, quality and
timeliness problems with several critical components including certain custom
integrated circuits. We cannot be certain that these or other problems will not
continue to occur in the future with our suppliers or outside subcontractors.
Our reliance on a limited group of suppliers and on outside subcontractors
involves several risks, including an

inability to obtain an adequate supply of required components, subassemblies
and services and reduced control over the price, timely delivery, reliability
and quality of components, subassemblies and services. Shortages, delays,
disruptions or terminations of the sources for these components and
subassemblies have delayed and could continue to delay shipments of our systems
and new products and could continue to have a material adverse effect on our
business. Our continuing inability to obtain adequate yields or timely
deliveries or any other circumstance that would require us to seek alternative
sources of supply or to manufacture such components internally could also have
a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of
operations. Such delays, shortages and disruptions would also damage
relationships with current and prospective customers and have and could
continue to allow competitors to penetrate our customer accounts. We cannot be
certain that our internal manufacturing capacity or that of our suppliers and
subcontractors will be sufficient to meet customer requirements.

The ATE industry is intensely competitive which can adversely affect our
revenue growth.

   With the substantial investment required to develop test application
software and interfaces, we believe that once a semiconductor manufacturer has
selected a particular ATE vendor's tester, the manufacturer is likely to use
that tester for a majority of its testing requirements for the market life of
that semiconductor and, to the extent possible, subsequent generations of
similar products. As a result, once an ATE customer chooses a system for the
testing of a particular device, it is difficult for competing vendors to
achieve significant ATE sales to such customer for similar use. Our inability
to penetrate any large ATE customer or achieve significant sales to any ATE
customer could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial
condition or results of operations.

   We face substantial competition from ATE manufacturers throughout the world,
as well as several of our customers. We do not currently compete in the testing
of microprocessors, linear ICs or DRAMs. Moreover, a substantial portion of our
net sales are derived from sales of mixed-signal testers. Many competitors have
substantially greater financial and other resources with which to pursue
engineering, manufacturing, marketing and distribution of their products.
Certain competitors have recently introduced or announced new products with
certain performance or price characteristics equal or superior to products we
currently offer. These competitors have recently introduced products that
compete directly against our products. We believe that if the ATE industry
continues to consolidate through strategic alliances or acquisitions, we will
continue to face significant additional competition from larger competitors
that may offer product lines and services more complete than ours. Our
competitors are continuing to improve the performance of their current products
and to introduce new products, enhancements and new technologies that provide
improved cost of ownership and performance characteristics. New product
introductions by our competitors could cause a decline in our sales or loss of
market acceptance of our existing products.

   Moreover, our business, financial condition or results of operations could
continue to be materially adversely affected by increased competitive pressure
and continued intense price-based competition. We have experienced and continue
to experience significant price competition in the sale of our products. In
addition, pricing pressures typically become more intense at the end of a
product's life cycle and as competitors introduce more technologically advanced
products. We believe that, to be competitive, we must continue to expend
significant financial resources in order to, among other things, invest in new
product development and enhancements and to maintain customer service and
support centers worldwide. We cannot be certain that we will be able to compete
successfully in the future.

Our markets are subject to rapid technological change.

   Our ability to compete in our markets depends upon our ability to
successfully develop and introduce new hardware and software products and
enhancements and related software tools with greater features on a timely and
cost-effective basis, including products under development internally as well
as products obtained in acquisitions. Our customers require testers and
software products with additional features and higher performance and other
capabilities. We are therefore required to enhance the performance and other
capabilities

of our existing systems and software products and related software tools. Any
success we may have in developing new and enhanced systems and software
products and new features to our existing systems and software products will
depend upon a variety of factors, including:

  . product selection;

  . timely and efficient completion of product design;

  . implementation of manufacturing and assembly processes;

  . successful coding and debugging of software;

  . product performance;

  . reliability in the field; and

  . effective sales and marketing.

   Because we must make new product development commitments well in advance of
sales, new product decisions must anticipate both future demand and the
availability of technology to satisfy that demand. We cannot be certain that we
will be successful in selecting, developing, manufacturing and marketing new
hardware and software products or enhancements and related software tools. Our
inability to introduce new products and related software tools that contribute
significantly to net sales, gross margins and net income would have a material
adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
New product or technology introductions by our competitors could cause a
decline in sales or loss of market acceptance of our existing products. In
addition, if we introduce new products, existing customers may curtail
purchases of the older products and delay new product purchases. Any
unanticipated decline in demand for our hardware or software products could
have a materially adverse effect on our business, financial condition or
results of operations.

Significant delays can occur between the time we introduce a system and the
time we are able to produce that system in volume.

   We have in the past experienced significant delays in the introduction,
volume production and sales of our new systems and related feature
enhancements. For example, we have experienced significant delays in the
introduction of our VS2000 and Kalos series testers as well as certain
enhancements to our existing testers. These delays have been primarily related
to our inability to successfully complete product hardware and software
engineering within the time frame originally anticipated, including design
errors and redesigns of ICs. As a result, some customers have experienced
significant delays in receiving and using our testers in production. We cannot
be certain that these or additional difficulties will not continue to arise or
that delays will not continue to materially adversely affect customer
relationships and future sales. Moreover, we cannot be certain that we will not
encounter these or other difficulties that could delay future introductions or
volume production or sales of our systems or enhancements and related software
tools. We have incurred and may continue to incur substantial unanticipated
costs to ensure the functionality and reliability of our testers and to
increase feature sets. If our systems continue to have reliability, quality or
other problems, or the market perceives our products to be feature deficient,
we may suffer reduced orders, higher manufacturing costs, delays in collecting
accounts receivable and higher service, support and warranty expenses, or
inventory write-offs, among other effects. Our failure to have a competitive
tester and related software tools available when required by a customer could
make it substantially more difficult for us to sell testers to that customer
for a number of years. We believe that the continued acceptance, volume
production, timely delivery and customer satisfaction of our newer digital,
mixed signal and non-volatile memory testers are of critical importance to our
future financial results. As a result, our inability to correct any technical,
reliability, parts shortages or other difficulties associated with our systems
or to manufacture and ship the systems on a timely basis to meet customer
requirements could damage our relationships with current and prospective
customers and would continue to materially adversely affect our business,
financial condition and results of operations.

We may not be able to deliver custom hardware options and software applications
to satisfy specific customer needs in a timely manner.

   We must develop and deliver customized hardware and software to meet our
customers' specific test requirements. We must be able to manufacture these
systems on a timely basis. Our test equipment may fail to meet our customers'
technical or cost requirements and may be replaced by competitive equipment or
an alternative technology solution. Our inability to meet such hardware and
software requirements could impact our ability to recognize revenue on the
related equipment. Our inability to provide a test system that meets requested
performance criteria when required by a device manufacturer would severely
damage our reputation with that customer. This loss of reputation may make it
substantially more difficult for us to sell test systems to that manufacturer
for a number of years.

We rely on Spirox Corporation and customers in Taiwan for a significant portion
of our revenues and the termination of this distribution relationship would
materially adversely affect our business.

   Spirox Corporation, a distributor in Taiwan that sells to end-user customers
in Taiwan and China, accounted for approximately 20%, 45%, and 39% of our net
sales in the first half of fiscal 2001 and fiscal years 2000 and 1999,
respectively. One end-user customer headquartered in Taiwan accounted for
approximately 19% of our net sales in fiscal 2000. Our agreement with Spirox
can be terminated for any reason on 90 days prior written notice. The
semiconductor industry is highly concentrated, and a small number of
semiconductor device manufacturers and contract assemblers account for a
substantial portion of the purchases of semiconductor test equipment generally,
including our test equipment. Our top ten end user customers have recently
accounted for a substantial portion of our net sales. Consequently, our
business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially
adversely affected by the loss of or any reduction in orders by Spirox, any
termination of the Spirox relationship, or any other significant customer,
including the potential for reductions in orders by assembly and tester service
companies which that customer may utilize or reductions due to continuing or
other technical, manufacturing or reliability problems with our products or
continued slow-downs in the semiconductor industry or in other industries that
manufacture products utilizing semiconductors. Our ability to maintain or
increase sales levels will depend upon:

  . our ability to obtain orders from existing and new customers;

  . our ability to manufacture systems on a timely and cost-effective basis;

  . our ability to timely complete the development of our new hardware and
    software products;

  . our customers' financial condition and success;

  . general economic conditions; and

  . our ability to meet increasingly stringent customer performance and other
    requirements and shipment delivery dates.

Our long and variable sales cycle depends upon factors outside of our control
and could cause us to expend significant time and resources prior to earning
associated revenues.

   Sales of our systems depend in part upon the decision of semiconductor
manufacturers to develop and manufacture new semiconductor devices or to
increase manufacturing capacity. As a result, sales of our products are subject
to a variety of factors we cannot control. The decision to purchase our
products generally involves a significant commitment of capital, with the
attendant delays frequently associated with significant capital expenditures.
For these and other reasons, our systems have lengthy sales cycles during which
we may expend substantial funds and management effort to secure a sale,
subjecting us to a number of significant risks. We cannot be certain that we
will be able to maintain or increase net sales in the future or that we will be
able to retain existing customers or attract new ones.

If we engage in acquisitions, we will incur a variety of costs, and the
anticipated benefits of the acquisitions may never be realized.

   We have developed in significant part through mergers and acquisitions of
other companies and businesses. We intend in the future to pursue additional
acquisitions of complementary product lines, technologies and businesses. We
may have to issue debt or equity securities to pay for future acquisitions,
which could be dilutive to then current stockholders. We have also incurred and
may continue to incur certain liabilities or other expenses in connection with
acquisitions, which have and could continue to materially adversely affect our
business, financial condition and results of operations.

   In addition, acquisitions involve numerous other risks, including:

  . difficulties assimilating the operations, personnel, technologies and
    products of the acquired companies;

  . diversion of our management's attention from other business concerns;

  . increased complexity and costs associated with internal management
    structures;

  . risks of entering markets in which we have no or limited experience; and

  . the potential loss of key employees of the acquired companies.

   For these reasons, we cannot be certain what effect future acquisitions may
have on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

Changes to financial accounting standards may affect our reported results of
operations.

   We prepare our financial statements to conform with generally accepted
accounting principles, or GAAP. GAAP are subject to interpretation by the
American Institute of Certified Public Accountants, the SEC and various bodies
formed to interpret and create appropriate accounting policies. A change in
those policies can have a significant effect on our reported results and may
even affect our reporting of transactions completed before a change is
announced. Accounting policies affecting many other aspects of our business,
including rules relating to purchase and pooling-of-interests accounting for
business combinations, in-process research and development charges, revenue
recognition, employee stock purchase plans and stock option grants have
recently been revised or are under review. Changes to those rules or the
questioning of current practices may have a material adverse effect on our
reported financial results or on the way we conduct our business. For example,
in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2001, we will be required to implement SAB 101
(see Note 4 of the Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements).
In addition, our preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP
requires that we make estimates and assumptions that affect the recorded
amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of those assets and liabilities
at the date of the financial statements and the recorded amounts of expenses
during the reporting period. A change in the facts and circumstances
surrounding those estimates could result in a change to our estimates and could
impact our future operating results.

Our executive officers and certain key personnel are critical to our business.

   Our future operating results depend substantially upon the continued service
of our executive officers and key personnel, none of whom are bound by an
employment or non-competition agreement. Our future operating results also
depend in significant part upon our ability to attract and retain qualified
management, manufacturing, technical, engineering, marketing, sales and support
personnel. Competition for qualified personnel is intense, and we cannot ensure
success in attracting or retaining qualified personnel. There may be only a
limited number of persons with the requisite skills to serve in these positions
and it may be increasingly difficult for us to hire personnel over time. Our
business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially
adversely affected by the loss of any of our key employees, by the failure of
any key employee to perform in his or her current position, or by our inability
to attract and retain skilled employees. In December 2000, our Chief Financial
Officer resigned from his positions with Credence. In connection with his
resignation, our board of directors promoted John R. Detwiler to the position
of Senior Vice President of Finance, Chief Financial Officer and Secretary in
February 2001.

Our international business exposes us to additional risks.

   International sales accounted for approximately 75%, 80%, and 64% of our
total net sales for the first half of fiscal 2001 and fiscal 2000 and 1999,
respectively. As a result, we anticipate that international sales will continue
to account for a significant portion of our total net sales in the foreseeable
future. These international sales will continue to be subject to certain risks,
including:

  . changes in regulatory requirements;

  . tariffs and other barriers;

  . political and economic instability;

  . an outbreak of hostilities;

  . integration and management of foreign operations of acquired businesses;

  . foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations;

  . difficulties with distributors, joint venture partners, original
    equipment manufacturers, foreign subsidiaries and branch operations;

  . potentially adverse tax consequences; and

  . the possibility of difficulty in accounts receivable collection.

   We are also subject to the risks associated with the imposition of domestic
and foreign legislation and regulations relating to the import or export of
semiconductor equipment and software products. We cannot predict whether the
import and export of our products will be subject to quotas, duties, taxes or
other charges or restrictions imposed by the United States or any other country
in the future. Any of these factors or the adoption of restrictive policies
could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or
results of operations. Net sales to the Asia-Pacific region accounted for
approximately 46%, 69%, and 55% of our total net sales in the first half of
fiscal 2001 and fiscal 2000 and 1999, respectively, and thus demand for our
products is subject to the risk of economic instability in that region and
could continue to be materially adversely affected. Countries in the Asia-
Pacific region, including Korea and Japan, have experienced weaknesses in their
currency, banking and equity markets in the recent past. These weaknesses could
continue to adversely affect demand for our products, the availability and
supply of our product components and our consolidated results of operations.
The 1997/1998 Asian financial crisis contributed to widespread uncertainty and
a slowdown in the semiconductor industry. This slowdown resulted in reduced
spending on semiconductor capital equipment, including ATE, and has had, and
may in the future have, a material adverse effect on our product backlog,
balance sheet and results of operations. Further, many of our customers in the
Asia-Pacific region built up capacity in ATE during fiscal 2000 in anticipation
of a steep ramp up in wafer fabrication. However, this steep ramp up in output
has not fully materialized leaving some customers with excess capacity.
Therefore, it is now probable that these customers will spend less in the
aggregate this year than they did in fiscal 2000.

   In addition, one of our major distributors, Spirox Corporation, is a Taiwan-
based company. This subjects a significant portion of our receivables and
future revenues to the risks associated with doing business in a foreign
country, including political and economic instability, currency exchange rate
fluctuations and regulatory changes. Disruption of business in Asia caused by
the previously mentioned factors could continue to have a material impact on
our business, financial condition or results of operations.

If the protection of proprietary rights is inadequate, our business could be
harmed.

   We attempt to protect our intellectual property rights through patents,
copyrights, trademarks, maintenance of trade secrets and other measures,
including entering into confidentiality agreements. However, we cannot be
certain that others will not independently develop substantially equivalent
intellectual property or that we can

meaningfully protect our intellectual property. Nor can we be certain that our
patents will not be invalidated, deemed unenforceable, circumvented or
challenged, or that the rights granted thereunder will provide us with
competitive advantages, or that any of our pending or future patent
applications will be issued with claims of the scope we seek, if at all.
Furthermore, we cannot be certain that others will not develop similar
products, duplicate our products or design around our patents, or that foreign
intellectual property laws, or agreements into which we have entered will
protect our intellectual property rights. Inability or failure to protect our
intellectual property rights could have a material adverse effect upon our
business, financial condition and results of operations. We have been involved
in extensive, expensive and time-consuming reviews of, and litigation
concerning, patent infringement claims.

Our business may be harmed if we are found to infringe proprietary rights of
others.

   We have at times been notified that we may be infringing intellectual
property rights of third parties and we have litigated patent infringement
claims in the past. We expect to continue to receive notice of such claims in
the future. In July 1998, inTEST IP Corporation, or inTEST, alleged in writing
that certain of our products are infringing a patent held by inTEST. We have
since then engaged in sporadic discussions with inTEST concerning this matter.
On December 15, 2000, inTEST filed a complaint in the U.S. District Court for
the District of Delaware against us, alleging infringement of inTEST U.S.
patent number 4,589,815 and seeking damages and injunctive relief. On April 10,
2001 we were served with the complaint. We may also be obligated to other third
parties relating to this allegation. We believe we have meritorious defenses to
the claims. However, we cannot be certain of success in defending this patent
infringement claim or claims for indemnification resulting from infringement
claims.

   Some of our customers have received notices from Mr. Jerome Lemelson
alleging that the manufacture of semiconductor products and/or the equipment
used to manufacture semiconductor products infringes certain patents issued to
Mr. Lemelson. We have been notified by customers that we may be obligated to
defend or settle claims that our products infringe Mr. Lemelson's patents, and
that if it is determined that the customers infringe Mr. Lemelson's patents,
that customers intend to seek indemnification from us for damages and other
related expenses.

   We cannot be certain of success in defending current or future patent or
other infringement claims or claims for indemnification resulting from
infringement claims. Our business, financial condition and results of
operations could be materially adversely affected if we must pay damages to a
third party or suffer an injunction or if we expend significant amounts in
defending any such action, regardless of the outcome. With respect to any
claims, we may seek to obtain a license under the third party's intellectual
property rights. We cannot be certain, however, that the third party will grant
us a license on reasonable terms or at all. We could decide, in the
alternative, to continue litigating such claims. Litigation has been and could
continue to be extremely expensive and time consuming, and could materially
adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations,
regardless of the outcome.

A variety of factors may cause the price of our stock to be volatile.

   In recent years, the stock market in general, and the market for shares of
high-tech companies in particular, including ours, have experienced extreme
price fluctuations, which have often been unrelated to the operating
performance of affected companies. For example, in fiscal 1999, the price of
our common stock ranged from a closing high of $24.94 to a closing low of
$7.19. In fiscal 2000 and through June 4, 2001, the price of our common stock
has ranged from a closing high of $74.59 to a closing low of $16.13. The market
price of our common stock is likely to continue to fluctuate significantly in
the future, including fluctuations unrelated to our performance.

   We believe that fluctuations of our stock price may be caused by a variety
of factors, including:

  . announcements of developments related to our business;

  . fluctuations in our financial results;

  . general conditions or developments in the semiconductor and capital
    equipment industry and the general economy;

  . sales or purchases of our common stock in the marketplace;

  . announcements of our technological innovations or new products or
    enhancements or those of our competitors;

  . developments in patents or other intellectual property rights;

  . developments in our relationships with customers and suppliers;

  . a shortfall or changes in revenue, gross margins or earnings or other
    financial results from analysts' expectations or an outbreak of
    hostilities or natural disasters; or

  . acquisition or merger activity and the success in implementing such
    acquisitions or other business combinations.

We are subject to anti-takeover provisions that could delay or prevent an
acquisition of our company.

   Provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation,
shareholders rights plan, equity incentive plans, bylaws and Delaware law may
discourage transactions involving a change in corporate control. In addition to
the foregoing, our classified board of directors, the stockholdings of our
officers, directors and persons or entities that may be deemed affiliates, our
shareholder rights plan and the ability of our board of directors to issue
preferred stock without further stockholder approval could have the effect of
delaying, deferring or preventing a third party to acquire us and may adversely
affect the voting and other rights of holders of our common stock.

                              Risks Related to IMS

IMS' operating results fluctuate from period to period.

   IMS' quarterly operating results have fluctuated widely in the past. IMS
expects this to continue. IMS' operating results fluctuate both because its net
revenues can fluctuate, and because it cannot always adjust its expenses
accordingly. These are the principal factors that cause IMS' net revenues to
fluctuate:

  . The timing of orders from customers, and the timing of shipments to, and
    acceptance by, customers, for IMS' integrated circuit validation systems.
    These systems typically range in price from $0.4 million to $1.8 million
    for a single unit, so even one shipment can have a very large impact on
    quarterly results, and a significant impact on annual results.

  . IMS' historical pattern of concentrated shipments in the last month and
    the last weeks of the quarter.

  . The volume and mix of products sold to customers. If customers buy fewer,
    or lower priced or lower margin systems, IMS earns less.

  . How successful IMS is in developing, introducing and shipping new
    products. If IMS expects a new product to be ready for customers by a
    particular date, and IMS experiences delays, IMS might lose sales or be
    able to realize them only in later quarters.

  . The length of IMS' sales cycles. It usually takes months, and much
    internal review, for a customer to decide to spend up to $2.3 million on
    one of IMS' systems. It is hard to predict how long the customers'
    decision processes will take.

  . The cyclical nature of the industries in which IMS customers do business.
    In times when IMS customers cannot sell their integrated circuits as fast
    as they would like, they are less likely to spend money on capital
    equipment like IMS' products.

  . The configurations of IMS' products its customers choose. If customers
    want more complex product configurations, it takes longer to build them,
    and IMS might not be able to ship them and obtain customer acceptance to
    recognize revenue until a later quarter.

  . Seasonal fluctuations in IMS' customers' buying habits. IMS' customers,
    particularly in the U.S. and Europe, vacation in the summer. IMS'
    customers generally approve yearly capital budgets in the first quarter,
    and then use up those budgets before the end of the year. These
    influences produce a seasonal fluctuation that results in relative
    declines in product sales for the first and third quarters and relative
    increases for the second and fourth quarters. Consequently, IMS'
    quarterly net revenues and operating results have in the past and will in
    the future depend upon IMS obtaining orders for validation systems to be
    shipped and accepted in the same quarter that the order is received.

   These are the principal factors that cause IMS' expenses to fluctuate:

  . The timing of expenditures in anticipation of future sales. IMS may spend
    money to put resources in place to support sales in periods earlier than
    when the sales happen. IMS might also misjudge when, whether or how much
    the sales will grow, and put resources in place too early. Either way
    IMS' expenses increase without concurrent increases in net revenues. This
    decreases IMS' profits for that period.

  . A significant portion of IMS' operating expenses is relatively fixed. IMS
    may not be able to reduce expenses in a particular period if IMS' revenue
    goals for that period are not met. If IMS cannot reduce expenses quickly
    enough, it can magnify the adverse impact of a net revenues shortfall on
    IMS' results of operations.

   For all of the above reasons, IMS' quarterly operating results have in the
past been and may in the future be different from the expectations of public
market analysts and investors. Because IMS' quarterly operating results
fluctuate, IMS believes that quarter-to-quarter comparisons of its operating
results are not necessarily meaningful and should not be relied upon as
indicators of future performance.

IMS' operating results fluctuate because its customers often place, adjust,
cancel or delay orders for complex custom systems late in the quarter.

   IMS usually configures its integrated circuit validation systems to meet
specific customer requirements. Over time, IMS' customers increasingly require
larger, more complex configurations of its systems. Complex configuration
requirements mean it takes longer to build the particular system for that
customer. Longer manufacturing times for those customers combined with sales
late in the quarter can cause shipments to slip into the next quarter. The
percentage of each quarter's shipments that occurred in the last month of each
quarter during 2000 and the first quarter of 2001 ranged from 46% to 70%.
Further, as customers consider their own quarterly results, they may delay or
cancel orders already placed, late in the quarter. During 1998 particularly,
IMS' quarterly net revenues were hurt by customer decisions to delay placing
orders or cancel plans to place orders for IMS' products in the last few days
of the quarter. All of these factors can greatly affect, and have greatly
affected, IMS' net revenues and results of operations in a particular quarter.

Much of IMS' net revenues are concentrated in one customer. If that customer
orders less or stops ordering, IMS' total net revenues will decline
significantly. Broadening IMS' customer base requires additional investments in
development resources.

   IMS has been and expects to continue to be dependent on one large customer
for a significant part of its net revenues. Sales to Intel Corporation, or
Intel, accounted for approximately 31% in the first quarter of 2001, 52% in
2000, 50% in 1999 and 25% in 1998. IMS expects relatively high concentrations
of net revenues from Intel to continue. No other customer now accounts, or in
the past three years has accounted, for as much as 10% of IMS' annual net
revenues. As a result, if Intel delays, reduces, or cancels orders, or decides
to buy products from a competitor instead, IMS' net revenues would decline
significantly. For example, IMS' 1998 net revenues dropped significantly due to
lower than expected sales to Intel. At that time, Intel was shifting its own

strategy and, in the process of managing that shift internally, substantially
slowed capital purchases. IMS' net revenues and earnings suffered substantially
from this event.

   Reducing customer concentration without losing a specific customer requires
attracting new customers. Attracting new customers may require adding new
features or capabilities to IMS' products that are important to those
customers. IMS' existing customers may also require new features and
capabilities that are not necessarily the same features that new customers
would need. To address both sets of needs, IMS can either address the needs of
potential new customers as a lower priority, or can add development resources.
A lower priority means delayed or lost revenues; adding resources means higher
expenses. Either result hurts IMS' operating performance.

Interruptions or problems in supply from single and sole source suppliers can
harm IMS' operating results.

   IMS relies on a number of sole source and single source suppliers for some
key components and customized assemblies for its products. A sole source
component is something that only one vendor makes, so IMS cannot buy it
elsewhere. A single source component is something that IMS can get from more
than one source, but is a component that IMS has chosen to purchase from a
single source to gain efficiencies in operations or cost. Any of these single
and sole source suppliers could experience financial, operational, production
or quality assurance difficulties, or a catastrophic event, or something else
that would result in a reduction, interruption or discontinuance in supply to
IMS. Single and sole source suppliers present these risks:

  . If a sole source supplier cannot deliver, and IMS does not have enough
    inventory to meet its needs, IMS must wait until that supplier can
    deliver or IMS must redesign its systems to use a different component.
    The resulting delay could substantially harm IMS' operating results.

  . If a single source supplier cannot deliver and IMS does not have enough
    inventory to meet its needs, IMS must wait until that supplier can
    deliver or until IMS can find and qualify another source. Finding supply
    at another source can be difficult. The resulting delay could
    substantially harm IMS' operating results.

  . If supplies are reduced, interrupted, or discontinued, it can take a long
    time, up to twenty-four months, before IMS would begin receiving supplies
    from alternative suppliers. In cases where supplies are discontinued and
    when designing that component out of the product is not feasible, IMS
    will place a last time buy order for the component. For example, IMS'
    ATS, XTS and Electra product lines incorporate components that have been
    discontinued. IMS has therefore made substantial last-time purchases of
    these components. IMS cannot be certain that such quantities will be
    adequate to meet its requirements over the remainder of the product's
    life or that such last-time buy quantities are not in excess of IMS'
    requirements over the product's remaining life.

  . Making some of IMS' single or sole source components and customized
    assemblies is a very complex process. That complexity can lead to
    production difficulties and quality variations, which can increase IMS'
    cost, hinder IMS' ability to deliver its products on time, or compromise
    the performance of IMS' own products in the field. For example, in 1998,
    IMS experienced late delivery of integrated circuits used in some of its
    integrated circuit validation systems, and discovered that these
    integrated circuits did not provide the performance IMS expected,
    requiring IMS to change its product specifications. As a result, IMS may
    have lost a previously identified sales opportunity.

IMS' results from its virtual test software business will suffer if IMS cannot
maintain relationships with vendors of ATE machines and EDA software.

   IMS' virtual test software creates a simulation of third party automated
test equipment, or ATE machines. IMS has to know how that equipment works
before it can create a software model of the ATE machine. IMS' ability to gain
that knowledge will be hindered if IMS' relationships with the vendors of that
equipment, including Agilent, Teradyne, Inc. and others, do not remain intact.
The proposed merger with Credence will

likely have a direct impact on future relationships with the vendors named
above and possibly other ATE manufacturers. For example, Agilent has provided
notice to IMS that it is cancelling an agreement it had in place with IMS. This
agreement provides that if IMS consummates a transaction with a competitor of
Agilent, Agilent may become,entitled, under certain circumstances, to obtain
IMS source codes deposited with Agilent in order to support the technology
covered by the agreement for a period of five years. IMS' virtual test software
also relies upon software simulation programs and other integrated circuit
software design tools written by third parties, including Cadence and others.
IMS' ability to take timely advantage of advances in those tools will be
hindered if IMS does not maintain close working relationships with those
vendors. Consequently, maintaining close working relationships both with
vendors of ATE machines and electronic design automation, or EDA, software is
of strategic importance to IMS. In particular, IMS' ability to maintain these
relationships if the merger with Credence is completed, and perhaps even if the
merger is not completed, may be adversely affected, since many of these
relationships are with competitors of Credence. If IMS cannot maintain
relationships with competing ATE providers, IMS' ability to achieve success in
the market for its virtual test software could be substantially compromised.

IMS' results of operations will suffer if IMS does not succeed in new markets.

   IMS has derived a majority of its net revenues to date from sales of its
logic validation systems. In 1995, IMS established its virtual test software
division and began developing the virtual test software market. In 1998, IMS
established its memory validation systems division and began selling its Orion
memory validation systems. Also in 1998, IMS established its mixed-signal
validation systems division and began marketing its Electra mixed-signal
validation systems. To date, these new divisions have contributed a relatively
small portion of IMS' sales. The risks associated with these new markets and
products include the following:

  . The markets for these products may not develop as IMS anticipates or IMS'
    products may not achieve market acceptance. In particular, the market for
    IMS' virtual test software has developed more slowly than IMS has
    anticipated and its software may never achieve wide market acceptance.

  . IMS may fail to appropriately allocate scarce development resources among
    its various divisions to develop and deliver products in a timely manner
    that meet its customers' needs.

  . IMS' product families employ different technologies and are targeted at
    different applications. This requires IMS to train its sales personnel to
    sell each of these different products. IMS may fail to adequately train
    its sales force to understand and sell these various product families
    which would negatively impact IMS' ability to grow.

  . IMS may fail to adequately allocate its manufacturing, inventory, field
    applications support and customer support resources among its various
    divisions. If IMS does not allocate these resources appropriately, IMS
    may lose customers and delay or lose orders.

  . Gross profits and inventory levels will be adversely affected if IMS
    experiences delays in new product introductions or start-up costs
    associated with simultaneous development and introduction of new
    products.

IMS' business will suffer if its products contain defects.

   IMS makes complex software and hardware products. No matter how much IMS
tests them, IMS knows it will not be able to test them completely. If IMS'
customers find errors in IMS' existing or new software or hardware products,
IMS could face, among others, any or all of these problems:

  . Legal actions against IMS, leading to costs and diversion of management
    time even if the actions are unsuccessful.

  . Diversion of development resources to try to fix the problems.

  . Loss of reputation and customers.

  . Increased support and service costs.

  . Loss of revenue and market share.

Sales of IMS' products are highly dependent on the strategic decisions of other
companies, and have a lengthy sales cycle.

   Sales of IMS' products depend in significant part upon the decisions of
companies in technology industries to develop and manufacture new electronic
devices. IMS has little or no influence on those decisions. Further, because
IMS' products are expensive, its customers must typically gain capital budget
approval to buy them. That process can take a long time. For new customers,
IMS' validation systems and virtual test software also represent a change in
the way they have done design and development in the past, so customers that
have not yet adopted the methods IMS' systems and software represent may need
to make basic changes in their own integrated circuit development approach to
take advantage of what IMS offers. For these and other reasons, sales of IMS'
products have lengthy sales cycles during which IMS may expend substantial
funds and management effort to secure a sale. This subjects IMS to fluctuations
in operating results over which they have little control.

IMS depends on key technical and senior management personnel.

   IMS' future success depends on the efforts and continued services of its key
executives and technical personnel and its ability to attract and retain
qualified management, technical and sales and support personnel. In IMS'
industry, significant competition exists for those people. IMS cannot be
certain that it will retain its existing personnel, find qualified replacements
or add enough people to serve its future needs. The market for technically
qualified people is particularly competitive. IMS also cannot be sure that
employees will not leave and then compete against it. If IMS cannot attract and
retain key personnel, it could seriously harm IMS' operating results.

IMS may be unable to adequately protect its proprietary technology.

   Generally, IMS has not sought patent protection for its validation systems,
services or processes. IMS has been issued two patents, which each involve
technologies relating to its virtual test software. In addition to these
patents, IMS principally relies on a combination of trade secret, copyright and
trademark laws, confidentiality agreements and contractual provisions to
protect its proprietary rights. Such protection is legally less absolute than
patent protection would be. The steps IMS has taken, such as entering into
proprietary rights agreements with its employees, may prove to be inadequate to
prevent third parties from using, infringing, or misappropriating IMS'
intellectual property. Moreover effective trademark, patent, copyright and
trade secret protection may not be available in other countries in which IMS
now operates, or will eventually operate, to the same extent such protection is
available in the United States. IMS cannot be certain that it will obtain
additional patents, trademarks or copyrights, or that its trade secrets will
remain secret to IMS. IMS also cannot be sure that its trademarks, patents,
copyrights, or trade secrets will be sufficiently broad to protect its
proprietary rights or will not be challenged or circumvented by competitors. If
IMS must enforce its rights, IMS may find that the cost of the proceeding
itself, both financially and in the time of key personnel, would be substantial
and would hurt IMS' operating results, even if IMS ultimately prevails.

   Although IMS enters into proprietary rights agreements with its employees
and consultants and controls access to and distribution of its proprietary
information, unauthorized parties, including departing employees, business
partners and others, may attempt to copy or otherwise obtain and use IMS'
intellectual property rights. Monitoring unauthorized use of IMS' intellectual
property rights is very difficult, and IMS may be unable to prevent
misappropriation of these rights.

IMS may confront, or be unable to protect itself from, claims by others with
respect to proprietary technology.

   IMS has in the past received notices of potential claims that its products
infringe another party's intellectual property rights. Several of IMS'
customers informed IMS that they received letters from Mr. Jerome Lemelson
alleging that equipment used in the manufacture of electronic devices infringes
patents issued to Mr. Lemelson relating to electronic manufacturing
technologies. Those customers may seek indemnification or contribution from IMS
for any damages and expenses resulting from this matter. If any of IMS'
equipment or software is found to infringe a patent, a court may grant an
injunction to prevent making, selling or using the equipment or software in the
United States or other markets covered by equivalent patents or award damages
against IMS. IMS may also be required to obtain licenses to the infringing
technology or expend significant resources to develop non-infringing
technology. IMS cannot predict the outcome of this or any similar claims it may
receive, or the effect of such claims upon IMS.

   Patent or other intellectual property litigation or claims could seriously
harm IMS' business, financial condition or results of operations. Irrespective
of the validity or success of such claims, IMS could incur significant costs,
both financially and in the time of key personnel, in defending them.

IMS could face infringement or other claims resulting from its employment of
competitors' former employees.

   IMS hires employees who have previously been employed by its competitors and
hire contractors who have previously performed work for its competitors. Some
of these competitors include companies with whom IMS has in the past held
detailed business discussions, including in-depth due diligence. Consequently,
former employers could assert claims against IMS, and IMS cannot be sure that
its practices and policies dealing with respecting obligations to those former
employers will be enough to prevent those claims from being successful.

IMS faces risks from international operations.

   IMS markets and sells its products worldwide. In 2000, international sales
represented 19% of IMS' net revenues and IMS anticipates that international
sales will continue to account for a significant portion of its revenues. In
addition, IMS develops and manufactures its Orion memory validation systems in
Europe. IMS' international operations are subject to a number of risks,
including:

  . The imposition of governmental controls on technology in IMS' overseas
    markets. Import restrictions have in the past and may in the future
    result in high tariffs or bans on imports of advanced technologies to
    protect a domestic industry.

  . Export restrictions or license requirements the United States may elect
    to impose or tighten, or that may affect future generations of IMS'
    products. These restrictions have particularly affected advanced
    technologies.

  . Fluctuations in the value of foreign currencies against the U.S. dollar.

  . Difficulties in staffing and managing international operations.

  . Political and economic instability in IMS' overseas markets.

  . Difficulties in collecting accounts receivable.

  . Changes in tariffs and taxes.

   The occurrence of the above factors could harm IMS' future international
sales and operations and, consequently, its business, financial condition and
results of operations.

IMS' limited experience in managing international development and manufacturing
operations, and the limited experience of its new development and manufacturing
teams in Europe, could damage IMS' operating results.

   In September 1998, IMS acquired a memory test company in Dresden, Germany,
and IMS now develops memory integrated circuit validation systems in Dresden.
IMS has also opened manufacturing operations for those systems in Sargans,
Switzerland, and shipped its first system to a customer in the second quarter
of 1999. Before those initiatives, IMS' development and manufacturing had
always been at the same facility, and always in the United States. Initiating
development and manufacturing of one of its product lines outside the United
States therefore represents a new experience for IMS as a company, and if IMS'
limited experience leads it to fail to anticipate problems that could arise, or
fail to manage the operations successfully for other reasons, IMS' results
could suffer. IMS' new risks include all of the usual risks of international
operations, such as currency fluctuations, cultural and language differences,
time zone differences and legal differences. In addition, the teams of people
in both Dresden and Sargans are relatively new to IMS, and relatively untested.
Until those teams gain experience and familiarity with the markets IMS serves,
the risks are higher both for employee turnover and for product design and
manufacturing introduction delays or cost overruns in those facilities than in
IMS' primary facility in the United States. Those risks could adversely affect
performance in IMS' memory test division, and therefore its operating results.

The inability to meet IMS' future capital requirements would limit its ability
to grow.

   Developing new and enhanced integrated circuit validation systems or virtual
test software is expensive. IMS may not have the resources for ongoing
development or may find that obtaining the necessary funds when needed might
not be possible on terms favorable to IMS' shareholders or at all. For example,
if the merger is not completed and IMS issues additional equity securities, IMS
shareholders may experience additional dilution and the new equity securities
may have rights, preferences or privileges senior to those of IMS' common
stock. If IMS cannot raise funds on acceptable terms, IMS may not be able to
develop or enhance its products, take advantage of future opportunities or
respond to competitive pressures or unanticipated requirements.

IMS' industry is subject to rapid technological change and IMS must introduce
new and enhanced products in a timely manner to effectively compete.

   The market for integrated circuit validation systems is characterized by
rapid technological change because integrated circuits themselves are evolving
so quickly. That rapid change requires IMS to spend significant resources
developing and introducing new products, and enhancing existing products. To
remain competitive, IMS' products must keep pace with technological
developments, with evolving industry standards and methodologies, and with the
increasingly sophisticated needs of IMS' customers. In fact, the introduction
of integrated circuits embodying new technologies or changes in industry
standards or customer requirements could render IMS' existing products obsolete
and unmarketable. Furthermore, commitments to develop new products generally
must be made well in advance of sales. That means IMS must anticipate both
future demand and the availability of technology to satisfy that future demand.
IMS' success in developing new and enhanced products to keep pace with changing
technology and demand depends upon a variety of factors, including:

  . IMS' ability to adequately fund new product development, and to raise the
    capital necessary to do so. IMS cannot assure you that it will have the
    budget necessary to keep pace with technological change.

  . IMS' ability to design new products and product enhancements efficiently
    and on time. This factor is not just a management risk, it is also an
    engineering and invention risk. IMS will need to solve technical problems
    caused by the increasing speed, density, complexity, and sophistication
    of the integrated circuits it tests. IMS cannot assure you that it can
    solve those problems, or that solutions even exist.

  . IMS' ability to manufacture and assemble systems on time and effectively,
    including its ability to find qualified and reliable sources for
    specialized components IMS may need for future products. IMS

   cannot assure you that it can find those suppliers, or that its products
   will be of sufficient quantity, quality and reliability to support its
   business.

  . IMS' ability to create products that its customers like and accept. This
    factor depends significantly on IMS' ability to accurately forecast what
    the market will need when its new designs are in production which may be
    many months or even years after IMS' product design is begun. IMS cannot
    assure you that it will be able to judge those needs successfully.

   As a result of any of these factors, IMS could lose orders and its business,
financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.
Combinations of these factors have in the past led to significant delays
between IMS' introduction of a new integrated circuit validation system or a
new version of its software and large scale customer deliveries of those
products, and have interfered with its ability to deliver enhancements as
quickly as IMS would have wanted to deliver them.

Competition in the electronic design and test industries is intense.

   IMS currently competes with customer-developed solutions and excess capacity
on ATE machines. ATE machines manufactured by companies including, but not
limited to, Advantest Corporation, Agilent, Credence, LTX Corporation,
Schlumberger Limited and Teradyne, Inc., can be used for logic and mixed-signal
validation. The primary competitor for IMS' Orion memory integrated circuit
validation systems is Mosaid Technologies. Most of these companies have
significantly greater financial, marketing, manufacturing and technological
resources than IMS does. IMS believes that its long-term success will depend
largely on its ability to identify design and test needs ahead of its
competitors and to develop products that respond to those needs in a timely
manner, and IMS cannot be certain of its ability to do this better than its
competition. New product introductions or product announcements by IMS'
competitors could cause a decline in sales or loss of market acceptance of its
existing or future products. Increased competitive pressure could also lead to
intensified price-based competition, eroding IMS' margins and hurting its
results. Additionally, EDA companies such as Avant! Corporation, Cadence,
Mentor Graphics Corporation or Synopsys, Inc. could elect to enter into the
virtual test software business and directly compete with IMS. Any of them, and
perhaps others, are financially and technologically well positioned to do so.
If one of the EDA software companies did introduce a virtual test product, it
could substantially harm IMS' sales of virtual test software.

IMS' business is particularly sensitive to general economic and market
conditions and cyclicality.

   The industries in which IMS competes and the markets that IMS serves are
highly cyclical. During recent years, segments of these industries, including
the aerospace, automotive, computer, consumer electronics, data communications,
medical electronics, semiconductor and telecommunications industries, have
experienced significant economic downturns from time to time. The semiconductor
industry is particularly volatile due to rapid technological change, short
product life cycles, fluctuations in manufacturing capacity and pricing and
gross margin pressures. IMS' operations have in the past and may in the future
fluctuate substantially from period to period as a consequence of industry
patterns like these, or of general economic conditions affecting the timing of
significant orders from customers and other factors affecting capital spending.

                              THE SPECIAL MEETING

Proxy Statement/Prospectus

   This proxy statement/prospectus is furnished in connection with the
solicitation of proxies from the holders of IMS common stock by the IMS board
of directors for use at a special meeting of IMS shareholders.

   This proxy statement/prospectus is first being furnished to shareholders of
IMS on or about [          ,             , 2001].

Date, Time and Place of the Special Meeting

   The special meeting will be held on [            , 2001] at 10:00 a.m.,
local time, at the Courtyard by Marriott, 8500 S.W. Nimbus Avenue, Beaverton,
Oregon 97008.

Matters to be Considered at the Special Meeting

   At the special meeting and any adjournment or postponement of the special
meeting, shareholders of IMS will be asked to consider and vote upon proposals:

  . To approve the agreement and plan of merger and reorganization, dated May
    16, 2001, as amended, by and among Credence, Iguana Acquisition
    Corporation and IMS. Under the agreement and plan of merger and
    reorganization, each outstanding share of IMS common stock will be
    converted into the right to receive 0.90 shares of Credence common stock
    (subject to adjustment to reflect the effect of any stock split, stock
    dividend, reorganization or similar change in Credence or IMS common
    stock); and

  . To transact such other business as may properly come before the special
    meeting.

Record Date and Shares Entitled to Vote

   IMS' board of directors has fixed the close of business on June 7, 2001, as
the record date for determination of IMS shareholders entitled to notice of,
and to vote at, the special meeting. As of the close of business on the record
date, there were approximately [   ] shares of IMS common stock outstanding and
entitled to vote, held by approximately [  ] shareholders of record of IMS.
Each IMS shareholder is entitled to one vote for each share of IMS common stock
held as of the record date.

Voting of Proxies

   You are requested to complete, date and sign the accompanying proxy and
promptly return it in the accompanying envelope or otherwise mail it to IMS. If
your shares are held in "street name" by your broker, your broker will vote
your shares only if you provide instructions on how to vote. Your broker will
provide you with directions regarding how to instruct your broker to vote your
shares. All properly executed proxies received by IMS prior to the vote at the
special meeting, and that are not revoked, will be voted in accordance with the
instructions indicated on the proxies. If no direction is made, your proxy will
be voted to approve the merger agreement. IMS' board of directors does not
presently intend to bring any other business before the special meeting and, so
far as is known to IMS' board of directors, no other matters are to be brought
before the special meeting. As to any business that may properly come before
the special meeting, however, it is intended that proxies, in the form
enclosed, will be voted in respect thereof by the proxy holders in such manner
as they determine to be in the best interests of IMS. You may revoke your proxy
at any time prior to its use by delivering to the Secretary of IMS a signed
notice of revocation or a subsequently dated, signed proxy, or by attending the
special meeting and voting in person. Attendance at the special meeting does
not in itself constitute the revocation of a proxy. If you fail to vote, it
will, in effect, count as a vote against approval of the merger.

Vote Required

   The Articles of Incorporation of IMS require the affirmative vote of the
holders of 67% of the shares of IMS common stock outstanding and entitled to
vote at the special meeting to approve the merger. Cadence, a shareholder of
IMS, has entered into a shareholder agreement and has delivered an irrevocable
proxy obligating it to vote in favor of the merger agreement and the merger. As
of the date of this proxy statement/prospectus, Cadence beneficially owned
2,559,000 shares (exclusive of any shares held by or issuable upon the exercise
of options or warrants held by any officer, director or employee of Cadence) of
IMS common stock (constituting approximately 32% of the shares of IMS common
stock outstanding as of the record date). As of the record date and the date of
this proxy statement/prospectus, Credence owns no shares of IMS common stock.

Quorum; Abstentions and Broker Non-Votes

   The required quorum for the transaction of business at the special meeting
is a majority of the shares of IMS common stock issued and outstanding on the
record date. If a quorum is not present in person or represented by proxy, it
is expected that the special meeting will be adjourned or postponed to solicit
additional proxies. Because approval of the merger agreement and the
consummation of the merger requires the affirmative vote of 67% of the
outstanding shares of IMS common stock entitled to vote, abstentions and broker
non-votes will have the same effect as votes against the merger agreement. In
addition, the failure of an IMS shareholder to return a proxy will have the
effect of a vote against the approval of the merger agreement. The actions
proposed in this proxy statement/prospectus are not matters that can be voted
on by brokers holding shares for beneficial owners without the owners' specific
instructions. Accordingly, you are urged to return the enclosed proxy card
marked to indicate your vote. Abstentions and broker non-votes each will be
included in determining the number of shares present and voting at the meeting
for the purpose of determining the presence of a quorum.

Solicitation of Proxies

   In addition to solicitation by mail, the directors, officers and employees
of IMS may solicit proxies from shareholders by telephone, facsimile or in
person. Also, Allen Nelson & Co. may solicit proxies at an approximate cost of
$3,000, plus reasonable expenses. IMS will bear its own expenses in connection
with the solicitation of proxies for its special meeting of shareholders,
although Credence will pay one-half of all printing and filing costs and
expenses incurred in connection with the registration statement and this proxy
statement/prospectus. Following the original mailing of the proxies and other
soliciting materials, IMS will request brokers, custodians, nominees and other
record holders to forward copies of the proxy and other soliciting materials to
persons for whom they hold shares of IMS common stock and to request authority
for the exercise of proxies. In these cases, IMS, upon the request of the
record holders, will reimburse the record holders for their reasonable
expenses.

No Dissenters' Rights

   You are not entitled to exercise dissenters' rights as a result of the
merger or to demand payment for your shares under Oregon law.

Board Recommendation

   The IMS board of directors has carefully considered the terms and conditions
of the merger and has unanimously determined that the terms are fair to, and in
the best interests of, IMS shareholders. The board of directors has unanimously
adopted the merger agreement and approved the merger and unanimously recommends
that you vote FOR the approval of the merger agreement and the merger. In
considering such recommendation, IMS shareholders should be aware that certain
IMS directors and officers have interests in the merger that are different
from, or in addition to yours. Please see the section entitled "Interests of
IMS Directors, Officers and Affiliates in the Merger" on page 67 of this proxy
statement/prospectus.

   The matters to be considered at the special meeting are of great importance
to the shareholders of IMS. Accordingly, you are urged to read and carefully
consider the information presented in this proxy statement/prospectus, and to
complete, date, sign and promptly return the enclosed proxy in the enclosed
postage-paid envelope.

   You should not send any stock certificates with your proxy card. A
transmittal form with instructions for the surrender of IMS common stock
certificates will be mailed to you promptly after completion of the merger. For
more information regarding the procedures for exchanging IMS stock certificates
for Credence stock certificates see "Merger and Related Transactions--Exchange
of IMS Stock Certificates for Credence Stock Certificates" herein.

                      THE MERGER AND RELATED TRANSACTIONS

   This section of the proxy statement/prospectus describes material aspects of
the proposed merger, including the material terms of the merger agreement.
While we believe that the description covers the material terms of the merger
and the related transactions, this summary may not contain all of the
information that is important to you. You should read this entire document and
the other documents, including the merger agreement, we refer to carefully for
a more complete understanding of the merger.

Background of the Merger

   Credence has developed in significant part through strategic mergers and
acquisitions of other companies and businesses. In furtherance of this
strategy, Credence has consulted from time to time with various third parties,
including investment banking firms, regarding strategic acquisition
opportunities.

   On February 28, 2001, during a meeting with Credence management, Credence
management expressed to SG Cowen an interest in the possibility of acquiring
IMS. SG Cowen thereafter communicated this interest to management of IMS.

   On March 1, 2001, Credence engaged Goldman, Sachs & Co. as its financial
advisor relating to the potential transaction with IMS.

   On March 6, 2001, after considering Credence's expression of interest, IMS
engaged SG Cowen as its exclusive financial advisor in connection with a
potential strategic transaction with Credence.

   On the afternoon of March 12, 2001, Dr. Graham J. Siddall, President and
Chief Executive Officer of Credence, and David A. Ranhoff, Executive Vice
President and Chief Operating Officer of Credence, met with Keith L. Barnes,
Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of IMS, and Fred Hall, Chief Financial
Officer of IMS. Also in attendance were a representative of Goldman Sachs and
representatives of SG Cowen. During the meeting, the parties discussed publicly
available information concerning their respective businesses, products,
markets, sales channels, and financial results.

   On March 27, 2001, at the request of IMS, representatives of SG Cowen met
with Dr. Siddall at the SG Cowen Technology Conference in Cannes, France. The
parties had preliminary discussions of the potential terms of a possible
transaction. Subsequently, representatives of IMS and SG Cowen discussed the
results of the meeting.

   On the afternoon of April 12, 2001, Mr. Barnes and Dr. Siddall met in
Portland, Oregon at the offices of Ater Wynne LLP, counsel to IMS, to discuss
possible terms of an acquisition, including price, transaction structure, roles
for IMS management after the merger, operating structure after the merger, and
employee benefits. During that meeting, the parties executed a non-disclosure
agreement in order to facilitate further discussion and due diligence relating
to a potential transaction. The parties scheduled in-depth technical and
business due diligence meetings.

   On April 13, 2001, Dr. Siddall, Todd Del Vecchio, Director, Strategic
Business Development, Bart Freedman, Vice President Worldwide Field Operations,
and Jim Ellis, former Vice President and General Manager of the NMS/DFT
Division of Credence, participated in a preliminary due diligence meeting with
Mr. Barnes and Barry Baril, Chief Technology Officer of IMS. The parties
discussed the companies' road maps and sales distribution channels.

   On April 18, 2001, Mr. Barnes reviewed the status of the merger discussions
with the Audit Committee of the IMS board of directors.

   On April 20, 2001, Dr. Siddall and Mr. Barnes participated in a telephone
conference regarding a proposed term sheet relating to a potential transaction.
After that call was concluded, Credence delivered a

working draft of a proposed term sheet. Over the next few days, IMS management
and advisors reviewed the term sheet and, working with Credence and Credence's
advisors, developed proposed changes, refinements, and modifications.

   On April 21, 2001, Dr. Siddall and Mr. Barnes had a breakfast meeting at the
offices of Ater Wynne LLP to discuss the proposed terms.

   Between April 23 and April 25, 2001, the parties through their investment
bankers discussed potential exchange ratios.

   On April 26, 2001, Dr. Siddall had a dinner meeting with Donald Grant,
President and Chief Operating Officer of IMS to discuss the companies'
respective businesses.

   On April 27, 2001, Credence delivered Credence's final draft of a term
sheet. Also on April 27, 2001, the IMS board of directors met to review that
proposal, the terms of the discussion and course of negotiations to date. At
the meeting, SG Cowen discussed the financial terms of the transaction with the
board of IMS. After discussion, the board of IMS unanimously directed
management to proceed with business, technical, legal, and financial due
diligence, and the negotiation of a definitive acquisition agreement.

   Also on April 27, 2001, IMS and Credence entered into an exclusive
negotiations letter agreement to permit due diligence and negotiation of a
definitive agreement. Pursuant to this agreement, IMS agreed not to solicit or
negotiate an alternative acquisition proposal by a party other than Credence
prior to May 16, 2001.

   On May 1, 2001, representatives for both companies met at the offices of
Ater Wynne LLP to review technology, products and product road maps. In
attendance for Credence were Dr. Siddall; John Detwiler, Senior Vice President
and Chief Financial Officer; Byron Milstead, Vice President and General
Counsel; George DeGeer, Senior Vice President and General Manager, Consumer
Mixed Signal Division; Mr. Ellis; Gary Gillette, Vice President Engineering for
the Memory Products Division; Steve Payne, Engineering Director for the
Consumer Mixed Signal Division; and Cathy Hearn, Vice President and Corporate
Controller. In attendance for IMS were Mr. Barnes; Mr. Hall; Mr. Baril; John
Miller, Vice President of Engineering; and Mark Allison, General Manager,
Memory Division. Goldman Sachs and SG Cowen were also represented.

   On May 2, 2001, representatives again met at the offices of Ater Wynne LLP,
this time to review human resource issues and IMS financial results, forecasts
and condition. In attendance for Credence were Mr. Detwiler; Mr. Milstead;
Dennis Hopwood, Vice President of Human Resources; Ms. Hearn; Bradley Wallin,
Operations Controller; and Steven Souders, Benefits Manager. In attendance for
IMS were Mr. Hall; Gwyn Harvey, Vice President of Human Resources; and Lois
Miesbach, Controller. Representatives of Goldman Sachs and SG Cowen also
attended.

   On May 4, 2001, at a regularly scheduled board meeting, IMS management
updated IMS' board of directors on the progress of due diligence, and based on
that due diligence, on management's conclusions concerning the technical and
business outlook for Credence, and for a combined Credence and IMS. The board
of IMS reviewed its duties in connection with consideration of the merger with
legal counsel.

   Also on May 4, 2001, the parties began negotiations of a definitive merger
agreement, and began bilateral legal due diligence. Both processes continued
during the next two weeks.

   On the afternoon of May 8, 2001, representatives from both companies met in
Fremont, California to review Credence's operations, distribution organization
and financial results, forecasts and condition. In attendance for Credence were
Dr. Siddall; Mr. Ranhoff; Mr. Detwiler; Mr. Milstead; Mr. Freedman; and Glyn
Davies, Vice President, Corporate Marketing. In attendance for IMS were Mr.
Barnes; Mr. Hall; and Mr. Grant. Also in attendance were representatives from
Goldman Sachs and SG Cowen.

   On May 10, 2001, representatives from both companies met at the offices of
Ater Wynne LLP to review IMS operations and distribution network and both
companies' manufacturing operations. In attendance for Credence were Mr.
Ranhoff and Debra Moberly, Vice President, Operations. In attendance for IMS
were Mr. Barnes, Mr. Grant and Mr. Hall.

   Between May 11, 2001 and May 15, 2001, the parties, along with their
investment bankers and attorneys participated in conferences for the purpose of
resolving remaining due diligence issues and open items within the merger
agreement, and to complete Credence management interviews with selected IMS
senior managers. Discussions regarding the merger agreement included, in
particular the provisions governing the IMS board's exercise of its fiduciary
duties pending close.

   On May 15, 2001, Credence's board of directors held a regularly scheduled
board meeting. As part of that meeting the board discussed the proposed
acquisition of IMS. The board discussed IMS' products and product strategies,
the market for such products and general information about IMS. The board of
Credence also reviewed the status of the transaction, including the proposed
terms of the transaction. The board of Credence then discussed the results of
Credence's due diligence review. Finally, the board of Credence discussed the
terms of the proposed acquisition and the directors' legal duties and
responsibilities. Credence's board unanimously voted to approve the merger
agreement and related transaction documents. Representatives of Goldman Sachs
were in attendance.

   On May 15, 2001, IMS' board of directors held a meeting and discussed with
management final due diligence results. In addition, SG Cowen delivered its
written analyses and its oral opinion to the IMS board of directors,
subsequently confirmed in writing as of the same date, to the effect that, and
subject to the various assumptions set forth therein, as of May 15, 2001, the
exchange ratio pursuant to the merger agreement was fair from a financial point
of view to the shareholders of IMS. Further, the IMS board of directors
reviewed with legal counsel the specific terms of the merger agreement
including provisions relating to the exercise of the board's fiduciary duties
pending close. The IMS board unanimously approved the merger agreement and
related transaction documents.

   On the morning of May 16, 2001, representatives of Brobeck, Phleger &
Harrison LLP and Ater Wynne LLP continued to finalize the terms of the merger
agreement and related transaction documents.

   On May 16, 2001, IMS and Credence entered into the merger agreement and
certain related agreements were executed and delivered by Credence and the
parties thereto. Promptly thereafter Credence and IMS issued a joint press
release announcing the proposed business combination.

   On June 1, 2001, IMS and Credence entered into amendment no. 1 to the merger
agreement.

Reasons for the Merger

 Credence's Reasons for the Merger

   Credence's board of directors has unanimously concluded that the merger is
in the best interest of Credence and its stockholders. Credence's board of
directors has identified several potential benefits of the merger that it
believes will contribute to the success of the combined company. These
potential benefits include:

  . a reduction in the volatility of Credence's business model;

  . the addition of complementary product lines and capabilities;

  . potentially expanded customer usage model from design prototype
    validation to production test;

  . a broader potential customer and relationship base;

  . a potentially expanded customer base geographically;

  . an enhanced technology portfolio;

  . a stronger virtual test product;

  . enhanced purchasing power with suppliers;

  . leverage of Credence's global salesforce; and

  . Credence's increased visibility in emerging markets and technologies.

   The Credence board of directors also identified and considered a number of
potentially negative factors in its deliberations concerning the merger,
including:

  . the possibility that the merger would not be consummated;

  . the risk that, despite the efforts of IMS and Credence, key technical,
    marketing and management personnel might choose not to remain employed by
    the combined company after the merger;

  . the fact that the exchange ratio is fixed and will not change with
    increases or decreases in the market price of either Credence's or IMS'
    stock before the closing of the merger;

  . the risk of market confusion and hesitation and potential delay or
    reduction in orders; and

  . the risk that the potential benefits sought in the merger might not be
    realized fully or within the time frame contemplated, if at all.

   The Credence board of directors has concluded that the potential benefits of
the merger outweigh these risks and for the strategic reasons set forth above,
the Credence board of directors has determined that Credence should proceed
with the merger agreement and the merger.

 IMS' Reasons for the Merger

   The IMS board of directors has unanimously adopted the merger agreement and
approved the merger and unanimously recommends that the holders of shares of
IMS common stock vote FOR the approval of the merger agreement and the merger.

   The IMS board of directors identified a number of benefits for IMS'
shareholders that could result from the merger. These potential benefits
include:

  . Liquidity--IMS has a relatively small number of shares that float in the
    public markets as compared to Credence. This lack of liquidity
    substantially reduces the number of potential buyers of IMS stock and is
    a direct cause of the low average daily trading volume. Merging with
    Credence could provide IMS shareholders with greater liquidity;

  . An extensive design prototype validation to production test solution,
    making the combined company more competitive than either of the companies
    individually;

  . The opportunity to leverage scarce development funds by eliminating
    redundancy in the products or components developed. IMS competes in a
    market where the other participants are generally significantly larger.
    The solutions for the market requirements are all quite similar, yet the
    funds available to IMS for developing those solutions are substantially
    less than those funds available to the other participants;

  . Because there are common components and technologies, combining with
    Credence should provide more leverage in purchasing those components and
    technologies;

  . Credence has a strong worldwide distribution network. Because the
    technologies, markets and business philosophies of the two companies are
    complementary, IMS will be able to leverage this distribution network to,
    over time, reduce its cost per sale;

  . The fixed exchange ratio of 0.9 to 1 represents a premium of
    approximately 58% to the closing price of IMS stock on May 14, 2001. IMS
    believes this is a competitive premium for mergers and acquisitions
    within the semiconductor industry during the past year; and

  . Credence is a strong participant in the ATE market. IMS believes that
    Credence has solid technology and products and is well positioned in its
    markets.

   In addition, the IMS board of directors noted that the merger is expected to
be accounted for as a pooling of interests and that no goodwill is expected to
be created on the books of the combined company as a result of the merger.

   The IMS board of directors also identified and considered a number of
potentially negative factors in its deliberations concerning the merger,
including:

  . the possibility that the merger would not be consummated and the effect
    of the public announcement of the merger on IMS' sales and operating
    results and IMS' ability to attract and retain key management, sales,
    marketing and technical personnel;

  . the risk that, despite the efforts of IMS and Credence, key technical,
    marketing, sales and management personnel might choose not to remain
    employed by the combined comapny after the merger;

  . the stock issued in the merger may be worth substantially less than the
    same number of shares are worth at the time the merger agreement was
    executed;

  . the risk of market confusion, hesitation and potential delay or reduction
    in orders and potential adverse effect on existing customer and supplier
    relationships;

  . the risk that the potential benefits sought in the merger might not be
    realized fully or within the time frame contemplated, if at all;

  . the substantial charges to be incurred, primarily in the quarter in which
    the merger is consummated, including costs of integrating the business
    and transaction expenses arising from the merger;

  . the restrictions imposed by the merger agreement on the operation of IMS
    prior to completion or termination of the merger agreement;

  . the challenges associated with integrating the operations of IMS and
    Credence; and

  . the other risks associated with Credence's business and the merger
    described under "Risk Factors" beginning on page 13 of this proxy
    statement/prospectus.

   The foregoing discussion of the information and factors considered by the
IMS board of directors is not intended to be exhaustive but is believed to
include all material factors considered by the IMS board of directors. In view
of the variety of factors considered in connection with its evaluation of the
merger, the IMS board of directors did not find it practicable to and did not
quantify or otherwise assign relative weight to the specific factors considered
in reaching its determination. In addition, individual members of the IMS board
of directors may have given different weight to different factors.

Recommendation of IMS' Board of Directors

   For the reasons discussed above and after careful consideration, the IMS
board of directors has unanimously adopted the merger agreement and approved
the merger and unanimously recommends that IMS shareholders vote "FOR" approval
of the merger agreement and the merger.

   In considering the recommendation of the IMS board of directors, you should
be aware that some of the directors and officers of IMS have interests in the
merger that are different from, or are in addition to, the interests of IMS
shareholders generally. Please see the section entitled "Interests of IMS
Directors, Officers and Affiliates in the Merger" on page 67 of this proxy
statement/prospectus.

Opinion of SG Cowen, Financial Advisor to IMS

   Pursuant to an engagement letter dated March 6, 2001, IMS retained SG Cowen
Securities Corporation to act as exclusive financial advisor to IMS in
connection with the merger.

   On May 15, 2001, SG Cowen delivered written analyses and its oral opinion to
the IMS board of directors, subsequently confirmed in writing as of the same
date, to the effect that and subject to the various assumptions set forth
therein, as of May 15, 2001, the exchange ratio pursuant to the merger
agreement was fair, from a financial point of view, on the date of such
opinion, to the shareholders of IMS.

   The full text of the written opinion of SG Cowen, dated May 15, 2001, is
attached as Appendix C and is incorporated into this proxy statement/prospectus
by reference. Holders of IMS common stock are urged to read the opinion in its
entirety for the assumptions made, procedures followed, other matters
considered and limits of the review by SG Cowen. The summary of the written
opinion of SG Cowen set forth herein is qualified in its entirety by reference
to the full text of the SG Cowen opinion. SG Cowen's analyses and opinion were
prepared for and addressed to the IMS board and are directed only to the
fairness, from a financial point of view, of the exchange ratio, and do not
constitute an opinion as to the merits of the transaction or a recommendation
to any shareholder as to how to vote on the proposed transaction. The exchange
ratio was determined through negotiations between IMS and Credence and not
pursuant to recommendations of SG Cowen.

   In arriving at its opinion, SG Cowen reviewed and considered the financial
and other matters as it deemed relevant, including, among other things:

  . a draft of the merger agreement dated May 14, 2001;

  . certain publicly available information for IMS, including its annual
    report filed on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2000, its press
    release dated April 18, 2001, its Proxy Statement dated April 18, 2001,
    and certain other relevant financial and operating data furnished to SG
    Cowen by IMS management;

  . certain publicly available information for Credence, including its annual
    report filed on Form 10-K for the year ended October 31, 2000, its
    quarterly report filed on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended January 31,
    2001, its Proxy Statement dated February 20, 2001 and certain other
    relevant financial and operating data furnished to SG Cowen by Credence
    management;

  . certain internal financial analyses, financial forecasts, reports and
    other information concerning IMS prepared by the management of IMS;

  . First Call estimates and financial projections in Wall Street analyst
    reports for each of IMS and Credence;

  . discussions SG Cowen had with certain members of the management of each
    of IMS and Credence concerning the historical and current business
    operations, financial conditions and prospects of IMS and Credence and
    such other matters SG Cowen deemed relevant;

  . certain operating results and the reported price and trading histories of
    the shares of common stock of IMS as compared to operating results and
    the reported price and trading histories of publicly traded companies SG
    Cowen deemed relevant;

  . certain financial terms of the merger as compared to the financial terms
    of certain selected business combinations SG Cowen deemed relevant;

  . based on the forecasts provided by IMS and certain Wall Street
    projections, the cash flows generated by IMS on a stand-alone basis to
    determine the present value of the discounted cash flows;

  . certain pro forma financial effects excluding goodwill of the merger on
    an accretion/dilution basis; and

  . such other information, financial studies, analyses and investigations
    and such other factors that SG Cowen deemed relevant for the purposes of
    its opinion.

   In conducting its review and arriving at its opinion, SG Cowen, with IMS'
consent, assumed and relied, without independent investigation, upon the
accuracy and completeness of all financial and other information provided to it
by IMS and Credence, respectively, or which was publicly available. SG Cowen
did not undertake any responsibility for the accuracy, completeness or
reasonableness of, or independently to verify, this information. In addition,
SG Cowen did not conduct or assume any obligation to conduct any physical
inspection of the properties or facilities of IMS or Credence. SG Cowen further
relied upon the assurance of management of IMS that they were unaware of any
facts that would have made the information provided to SG Cowen incomplete or
misleading in any respect. SG Cowen, with IMS' consent, assumed that the
financial forecasts it examined were reasonably prepared by the management of
IMS on bases reflecting the best currently available estimates and good faith
judgments of IMS management as to the future performance of IMS, and that such
projections, and Wall Street analyst projections utilized in SG Cowen's
analysis provide a reasonable basis for its opinion. Because the management of
Credence did not provide multi-year projections and Wall Street analyst
projections did not extend past Credence's 2002 calendar year, SG Cowen did not
perform a discounted cash flow analysis on Credence in reaching its opinion.

   SG Cowen did not make or obtain any independent evaluations, valuations or
appraisals of the assets or liabilities of IMS or Credence, nor was SG Cowen
furnished with such valuations. SG Cowen's services to IMS in connection with
the merger were comprised solely of rendering an opinion from a financial point
of view with respect to the exchange ratio. SG Cowen did not consider the
effect, if any, of any legal matters in its opinion, and expresses no opinion
with respect to any legal matter. SG Cowen's opinion was necessarily based upon
economic and market conditions and other circumstances as they existed and
could be evaluated by SG Cowen on the date of its opinion. SG Cowen was
directed by management of IMS and Credence to utilize certain Wall Street
projections in conducting its analysis. SG Cowen did not consider and was not
asked to consider the financial effects, if any, of any announcements that IMS
and Credence made or may make after SG Cowen delivered its fairness opinion
with respect to their past quarterly results or future performance. It should
be understood that although subsequent developments may affect its opinion, SG
Cowen does not have any obligation to update, revise or reaffirm its opinion
and SG Cowen expressly disclaims any responsibility to do so.

   For purposes of rendering its opinion, SG Cowen assumed, in all respects
material to its analysis, that the representations and warranties of each party
contained in the merger agreement are true and correct, that each party will
perform all of the covenants and agreements required to be performed by it
under the merger agreement and that all conditions to the consummation of the
merger will be satisfied without waiver thereof. SG Cowen assumed that the
final form of the merger agreement would be substantially similar to the last
draft received by SG Cowen prior to rendering its opinion. SG Cowen also
assumed that all governmental, regulatory and other consents and approvals
contemplated by the merger agreement would be obtained and that, in the course
of obtaining any of those consents, no restrictions would be imposed or waivers
made that would have an adverse effect on the contemplated benefits of the
merger. IMS informed SG Cowen, and SG Cowen assumed, that the merger (1) would
be recorded as a pooling-of-interests under generally accepted accounting
principles and (2) would be treated as a reorganization for tax purposes.

   SG Cowen's opinion does not constitute a recommendation to any shareholder
as to how the shareholder should vote on the proposed merger or to take any
other action in connection with the merger or otherwise. SG Cowen's opinion
does not imply any conclusion as to the likely trading range for Credence
common stock following consummation of the merger. SG Cowen's opinion is
limited to the fairness, from a financial point of view, of the exchange ratio
on the date of such opinion. SG Cowen expresses no opinion as to the underlying
business reasons that may support the decision of the IMS board to approve, or
IMS' decision to consummate, the merger.

   The following is a summary of the principal financial analyses performed by
SG Cowen to arrive at its opinion. Some of the summaries of financial analyses
include information presented in tabular format. In order to fully understand
the financial analyses, the tables must be read together with the text of each
summary. The tables alone do not constitute a complete description of the
financial analyses. Considering the data set forth in

the tables without considering the full narrative description of the financial
analyses, including the methodologies and assumptions underlying the analyses,
could create a misleading or incomplete view of the financial analyses. SG
Cowen performed various procedures, including each of the financial analyses
described below, and reviewed with the management of IMS and Credence the
assumptions on which those analyses were based and other factors, including the
historical and projected financial results of IMS and Credence. No limitations
were imposed by the IMS board with respect to the investigations made or
procedures followed by SG Cowen in rendering its opinion.

   Stock Trading History. To provide contextual data and comparative market
data, SG Cowen reviewed the historical market prices of IMS common stock for
the twelve month period ended May 14, 2001. SG Cowen noted that over the
indicated period the high and low prices for shares of IMS common stock were
$20.88 and $7.00. SG Cowen also reviewed the historical market prices of
Credence common stock for the twelve month period ended May 14, 2001. SG Cowen
noted that over the indicated period the high and low prices for shares of
Credence common stock were $72.75 and $14.75.

   Contribution Analysis. SG Cowen analyzed the respective contributions of IMS
and Credence to the combined company based on the latest twelve months
(referred to as LTM) reported revenues, earnings before interest expense and
taxes (referred to as EBIT) and earnings and calendar year 2001 and calendar
year 2002 estimated revenues, and EBIT and earnings. This analysis was based
upon the historical financial results of IMS and Credence, and also the
projected financial results of IMS and Credence obtained from, with IMS'
management's consent, SG Cowen Equity Research dated April 19, 2001 for IMS'
calendar years ended 2001 and 2002, SG Cowen Equity Research estimates dated
April 19, 2001 for Credence's calendar year 2001 and Salomon Smith Barney
Equity Research estimates dated April 19, 2001 for Credence's calendar year
2002. Additionally, SG Cowen's analysis, with IMS' management's consent, used
SG Cowen Equity Research dated April 19, 2001, for calendar year 2002 to
illustrate a downside case for Credence. These research reports were utilized
upon the direction of each management team, respectively. The table below shows
IMS' and Credence's respective percentage contributions with respect to each of
these items.

   Historical Stock Trading Analysis. SG Cowen analyzed the closing prices of
IMS common stock over various periods ending May 14, 2001. The table below
illustrates the stock prices for those periods and the premium or discount
implied by the implied offer price in the merger to those historical stock
prices.

   Analysis of Selected Publicly Traded Companies. To provide contextual data
and comparative market information, SG Cowen compared selected historical
operating and financial data and ratios for IMS to the corresponding financial
data and ratios of other companies whose securities are publicly traded and
which SG Cowen believes have operating, market valuation and trading valuations
similar to what might be expected of IMS. These companies were:

  . Aehr Test Systems, Inc.

  . Aetrium Inc.

  . Credence Systems Corporation

  . Cohu, Inc.

  . Electroglas, Inc.

  . FEI Co.

  . InTest Corp.

  . LTX Corp.

  . Teradyne, Inc.

   The data and ratios included the market capitalization of common stock plus
total debt less cash and equivalents (referred to as the enterprise value) of
the selected companies, as multiples of LTM revenues, calendar year 2001
estimated revenue and calendar year 2002 projected revenue, and LTM EBIT. SG
Cowen also examined the ratios of the current share prices of the selected
companies to the LTM earnings per share and estimated calendar year 2002
earnings per share (in each case, as available from Wall Street analyst reports
or, if not so available, First Call) for the selected companies.

   The following table presents, for the periods indicated, the multiples
implied by the ratio of enterprise value to LTM revenues and estimates for
calendar year 2001 and 2002 revenues, and LTM EBIT, and the ratio of equity
value to LTM earnings and estimates for calendar year 2002 earnings. The
information in the table is based on the closing stock price of IMS and
Credence common stock on May 14, 2001.

   Although the selected companies were used for comparison purposes, none of
those companies is directly comparable to IMS. Accordingly, an analysis of the
results of such a comparison is not purely mathematical, but instead involves
complex considerations and judgments concerning differences in historical and
projected financial and operating characteristics of the selected companies and
other factors that could affect the public trading value of the selected
companies or IMS to which they are being compared.

   Analysis of Selected Transactions. SG Cowen reviewed the financial terms, to
the extent publicly available, of 11 representative transactions in the
semiconductor capital equipment industry and similar technology industries
(referred to as the total transactions) announced or completed since December
9, 1998, which included 7 transactions announced prior to August 2000 (referred
to as the pre-August 2000 transactions) and 4 transactions announced after
August 2000 (referred to as the post-August 2000 transactions). These
transactions were (listed as acquiror/target/announcement date):

  . Novellus Systems, Inc. / GaSonics International Corp. / October 25, 2000

  . Kulicke & Soffa Industries, Inc. / Cerprobe Corp. / October 12, 2000

   SG Cowen reviewed the enterprise value paid in the representative
transactions as a multiple of LTM revenues and EBIT, and also examined the
multiples of equity value paid in the representative transactions to book value
and LTM earnings.

   The following table presents, for the periods indicated, the multiples
implied by the ratio of enterprise value to LTM revenues and EBIT, and the
ratio of equity value to book value and LTM earnings. The information in the
table is based on the closing stock price of IMS and Credence stock on May 14,
2001.

   Although the representative transactions were used for comparison purposes,
none of those transactions is directly comparable to the merger, and none of
the companies in those transactions is directly comparable to IMS or Credence.
Accordingly, an analysis of the results of this comparison is not purely
mathematical, but instead involves complex considerations and judgments
concerning differences in historical and projected financial and operating
characteristics of the companies involved and other factors that could affect
the acquisition value of these companies or IMS to which they are being
compared.

   Analysis of Premiums Paid in Selected Transactions. SG Cowen reviewed the
premium of the offer price over the trading prices one trading day and four
weeks prior to the announcement date of the 11 representative transactions in
the semiconductor capital equipment industry and similar technology industries
described above. The following table presents the premiums of offer prices over
the trading prices one trading day and four weeks prior to the announcement
date for the respective transactions, and the premiums implied for IMS, based
on the exchange ratio. The information in the table is based on the closing
price of Credence and IMS common stock on May 14, 2001.

   Discounted Cash Flow Analysis. SG Cowen estimated a range of values for IMS
common stock based upon the discounted present value of the projected after-tax
cash flows of IMS described in the financial forecasts based on Wall Street
analyst research and provided by management of IMS, and in the financial
forecasts on a fully taxed basis, for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2001
through December 31, 2005, and of the terminal value of IMS at December 31,
2005, based upon multiples of earnings before interest expense, taxes, and
depreciation and amortization (referred to as EBITDA). After-tax cash flow was
calculated by taking projected EBIT and subtracting from this amount projected
taxes, capital expenditures, software development costs, service spare parts,
changes in working capital and changes in other assets and liabilities and
adding back

projected depreciation and amortization. This analysis was based upon
assumptions described by, projections supplied by and discussions held with the
management of IMS. In performing this analysis, SG Cowen utilized discount
rates ranging from 14% to 20%, which were selected based on the estimated
industry weighted average cost of capital. SG Cowen utilized terminal multiples
of EBITDA ranging from 5.0 times to 9.0 times, representing the general range
of multiples of EBITDA for the selected companies.

   Utilizing this methodology, the per share equity value of IMS ranged from
$17.43 to $30.01 per share, based on the fully taxed financial forecasts.
Because the discounted terminal value accounted for such a high percentage of
the discounted present value of IMS, SG Cowen did not ascribe significance to
this analysis in reaching its opinion.

   Pro Forma Earnings Analysis. SG Cowen analyzed the potential effect of the
proposed merger on the projected combined income statement of operations of
Credence and IMS for the quarters ended September 30, 2001 and December 31,
2001 and the calendar years ended December 31, 2001 and 2002 (assuming
Credence's results for the quarters ended October and January correspond to
calendar quarters ended September and December, and year ended January
correspond to year ended December). This analysis was based upon (1) the
projected financial forecasts of Credence and IMS for Credence and (2)
7,859,597 primary shares of IMS common stock outstanding and options to
purchase 2,407,004 shares of IMS common stock outstanding at a weighted average
exercise price of $9.89 according to IMS as of March 31, 2001. This analysis,
with IMS' management's consent, used SG Cowen Equity Research estimates dated
April 19, 2001, for IMS' quarters ended September 30, 2001 and December 31,
2001 and calendar year 2001, SG Cowen Equity Research estimates dated April 19,
2001, for Credence's calendar year 2001 and Salomon Smith Barney Equity
Research estimates dated April 19, 2001, for Credence's calendar year 2002.
Additionally, SG Cowen's analysis, with IMS' management's consent, used SG
Cowen Equity Research dated April 19, 2001, for calendar year 2002 to
illustrate a downside case for Credence.

   This analysis indicated that the proposed merger could increase Credence's
projected earnings per share, on an after-tax basis, for the quarters ended
September 30, 2001 and December 31, 2001 (assuming Credence's results for the
quarters ended October and January correspond to calendar quarters ended
September and December, and year ended October correspond to year ended
December) and calendar year 2001 by $0.02, $0.04, $0.14, respectively, and
decrease Credence's projected earnings per share, on an after-tax basis, for
the calendar year 2002 by $(0.04). Using SG Cowen Equity Research estimates
dated April 19, 2001 to illustrate a downside case for Credence, the proposed
merger could increase Credence's projected earnings per share, on an after-tax
basis, for the calendar year ended 2002 by $0.06. SG Cowen's pro forma earnings
analysis did not take into account the possible effect of any cost savings or
synergies in the proposed merger. The table below summarizes the results.

   Additionally, SG Cowen performed analysis which indicated that the proposed
merger could decrease IMS' projected earnings per share, on an after-tax basis,
for the quarters ended September 30, 2001 and December 31, 2001 and calendar
year 2001 by $(0.17), $(0.26), $(0.93), respectively, and increase IMS'
projected earnings per share, on an after-tax basis, for the calendar year 2002
by $0.31. Using SG Cowen Equity Research estimates dated April 19, 2001 to
illustrate a downside case for Credence, the proposed merger

could decrease IMS' projected earnings per share, on an after-tax basis, for
the calendar year ended 2002 by $(0.37). SG Cowen's pro forma earnings analysis
did not take into account the possible effect of any cost savings or synergies
in the proposed merger. The table below summarizes the results.

   The summary set forth above does not purport to be a complete description of
all the analyses performed by SG Cowen. The preparation of a fairness opinion
involves various determinations as to the most appropriate and relevant methods
of financial analyses and the application of these methods to the particular
circumstances and, therefore, a fairness opinion is not readily susceptible to
partial analysis or summary description. SG Cowen did not attribute any
particular weight to any analysis or factor considered by it, but rather made
qualitative judgments as to the significance and relevance of each analysis and
factor. Accordingly, notwithstanding the separate factors summarized above, SG
Cowen believes, and has advised the IMS board, that its analyses must be
considered as a whole and that selecting portions of its analyses and the
factors considered by it, without considering all analyses and factors, could
create an incomplete view of the process underlying its opinion. In performing
its analyses, SG Cowen made numerous assumptions with respect to industry
performance, business and economic conditions and other matters, many of which
are beyond the control of IMS and Credence. These analyses performed by SG
Cowen are not necessarily indicative of actual values or future results, which
may be significantly more or less favorable than suggested by these analyses.
In addition, analyses relating to the value of businesses do not purport to be
appraisals or to reflect the prices at which businesses or securities may
actually be sold. Accordingly, these analyses and estimates are inherently
subject to uncertainty, being based upon numerous factors or events beyond the
control of the parties or their respective advisors. None of IMS, Credence, SG
Cowen or any other person assumes responsibility if future results are
materially different from those projected. The analyses supplied by SG Cowen
and its opinion were among several factors taken into consideration by the IMS
board in making its decision to enter into the merger agreement and should not
be considered as determinative of such decision.

   SG Cowen was selected by the IMS board to render an opinion to the IMS board
because SG Cowen is a nationally recognized investment banking firm and
because, as part of its investment banking business, SG Cowen is continually
engaged in the valuation of businesses and their securities in connection with
mergers and acquisitions, negotiated underwritings, secondary distributions of
listed and unlisted securities, private placements and valuations for corporate
and other purposes. SG Cowen is providing financial services for IMS for which
it will receive customary fees. In addition, in the ordinary course of its
business, SG Cowen and its affiliates trade the equity securities of IMS and
Credence for their own account and for the accounts of their customers, and,
accordingly, may at any time hold a long or short position in these securities.
SG Cowen and its affiliates in the ordinary course of business have from time
to time provided, and in the future may continue to provide, commercial and
investment banking services to IMS and Credence, including serving as a
financial advisor on potential acquisitions and as an underwriter on equity
offerings, and have received and may in the future receive fees for the
rendering of such services. In particular, SG Cowen has acted as co-managing
underwriter for Credence on its initial public offering in 1993 and subsequent
follow-on offerings in 1994, 1995 and 2000.

   Pursuant to the SG Cowen engagement letter, if the merger is consummated, SG
Cowen will be entitled to receive a transaction fee based on Credence's closing
share price on the date of completion of the merger. Based on Credence's
closing share price on May 31, 2001, the transaction fee would be approximately
$2.9 million. IMS has also agreed to pay a fee of $500,000 to SG Cowen for
rendering its opinion, which fee

shall be credited against any transaction fee paid. Additionally, IMS has
agreed to reimburse SG Cowen for its out-of-pocket expenses, including
attorneys' fees, and has agreed to indemnify SG Cowen against certain
liabilities, including liabilities under the federal securities laws. The terms
of the fee arrangement with SG Cowen, which are customary in transactions of
this nature, were negotiated at arm's length between IMS and SG Cowen, and the
IMS board was aware of the arrangement, including the fact that a significant
portion of the fee payable to SG Cowen is contingent upon the completion of the
transaction.

Completion and Effectiveness of the Merger

   The merger will be completed when all of the conditions of the merger are
satisfied or waived, including approval of the merger agreement by the IMS
shareholders. The merger will become effective upon the filing of the articles
of merger with the Secretary of State for the State of Oregon.

   We are working towards completing the merger as quickly as possible. We hope
to complete the merger by the end of July 2001. Because the merger is subject
to government approvals, we cannot predict the exact timing.

Structure of the Merger and Conversion of IMS Common Stock

   In accordance with the merger agreement and Oregon law, Iguana Acquisition
Corporation, a newly-formed, wholly-owned subsidiary of Credence, will be
merged with and into IMS. As a result of the merger, the separate corporate
existence of Iguana Acquisition Corporation will cease and IMS will survive the
merger as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Credence. Upon consummation of the
merger, the members of IMS' board of directors will be Graham J. Siddall, John
R. Detwiler and Keith L. Barnes. The membership of the Credence board of
directors will remain unchanged as a result of the merger. Following the
merger, the officers of IMS will be Mr. Barnes (President), Fred Hall (Vice
President-Finance) and Mr. Detwiler (Vice President and Assistant Secretary).

   Upon completion of the merger, each outstanding share of IMS common stock
will automatically be canceled and converted into the right to receive 0.90
shares of Credence common stock (subject to adjustment to reflect the effect of
any stock split, stock dividend, reorganization or similar change in Credence
or IMS common stock). A corresponding right to purchase shares of Credence
Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock, par value $0.001 per share,
pursuant to a Rights Agreement dated as of June 2, 1998 between Credence and
BankBoston, N.A. will accompany each share of Credence common stock. The number
of shares of Credence common stock issuable in the merger will be
proportionately adjusted for any stock split, stock dividend, reorganization or
similar change in IMS common stock or Credence common stock effected between
the date of the merger agreement and the completion of the merger.

   No fractional shares of Credence common stock will be issued in connection
with the merger. In lieu of a fraction of a share of Credence common stock, you
will receive an amount of cash equal to the product of the fraction multiplied
by the average closing price for a share of Credence common stock as quoted on
the Nasdaq National Market for the last ten trading days ending on the third
full trading day prior to the completion of the merger.

Exchange of IMS Stock Certificates for Credence Stock Certificates

   Once the merger is completed, Credence's transfer agent, EquiServe, who will
act as exchange agent, will mail to you a letter of transmittal and
instructions for use in surrendering your IMS stock certificates in exchange
for Credence stock certificates. When you deliver your IMS stock certificates
to the exchange agent along with a properly executed letter of transmittal and
any other required documents, your IMS stock certificates will be canceled and
you will receive Credence stock certificates (except in the case of IMS stock
held subject to vesting or repurchase rights which will be held in book form)
representing the number of full shares of Credence common stock to which you
are entitled under the merger agreement (and cash in lieu of fractional
shares).

   YOU SHOULD NOT SUBMIT YOUR STOCK CERTIFICATES FOR EXCHANGE UNTIL YOU HAVE
RECEIVED THE LETTER OF TRANSMITTAL AND INSTRUCTIONS REFERRED TO ABOVE.

   You are not entitled to receive any dividends or other distributions on
Credence common stock with a record date after the merger is completed until
you have surrendered your IMS stock certificates in exchange for Credence stock
certificates.

   If there is any dividend or other distribution on Credence common stock with
a record date after the merger and a payment date prior to the date you
surrender your IMS stock certificates in exchange for Credence stock
certificates, you will receive it with respect to the whole shares of Credence
common stock issued to you promptly after your IMS stock certificates are
surrendered, without interest. If there is any dividend or other distribution
on Credence common stock with a record date after the merger and a payment date
after the date you surrender your IMS stock certificates in exchange for
Credence stock certificates, you will receive it with respect to the whole
shares of Credence common stock issued to you promptly after the payment date
related to such dividend or other distribution.

   Credence will only issue a Credence stock certificate, or a check in lieu of
a fractional share, in a name other than the name in which a surrendered IMS
stock certificate is registered, if you present the exchange agent with all
documents required to show and effect the unrecorded transfer of ownership and
show that you paid any applicable stock transfer taxes.

Treatment of IMS Stock Options and Stock Incentive Plans

   Upon completion of the merger, each outstanding option to purchase shares of
IMS common stock issued under IMS' 1995 Stock Incentive Plan, 1995 Stock Option
Plan for Non-Employee Directors and 2000 Nonqualified Stock Option Plan will be
assumed by Credence regardless of whether the options are vested or unvested.
Each IMS stock option, which will be assumed by Credence, will continue to have
the same terms, and be subject to the same conditions, that were applicable to
the option immediately prior to completion of the merger, except that:

  . each IMS stock option will be exercisable for shares of Credence common
    stock;

  . the number of shares of Credence common stock issuable upon exercise of
    any given IMS option will be determined by multiplying the exchange ratio
    of 0.90 by the number of shares of IMS common stock underlying the
    option, rounded down to the nearest whole number;

  . the per share exercise price of any given option will be determined by
    dividing the exercise price of the option immediately prior to completion
    of the merger by the exchange ratio of 0.90, rounded up to the nearest
    whole cent; and

  . As of June 4, 2001, directors and executive officers of IMS held stock
    options, both vested and unvested, to purchase an aggregate of 1,313,747
    shares of IMS common stock under the 1995 Stock Incentive Plan and the
    1995 Stock Option Plan for Non-Employee Directors. If the merger is
    completed, approximately 39% of that total, consisting of the options to
    purchase 505,935 shares held by Keith L. Barnes, Donald E. Grant and Fred
    Hall, will accelerate and become fully vested and exercisable
    immediately, pursuant to their existing employment agreements, without
    any action by IMS or Credence. See "--Interests of IMS Directors,
    Officers and Affiliates in the Merger" herein.

   Credence has agreed to file a registration statement on Form S-8 covering
shares of Credence common stock issuable upon the exercise of outstanding IMS
options granted to individuals for which a registration statement on Form S-8
is available.

Treatment of Options Outstanding under the IMS 1995 Employee Stock Purchase
Plan

   Upon completion of the merger, each option to purchase shares under the IMS
1995 Employee Stock Purchase Plan will be assumed by Credence. Each
outstanding option to be assumed will be subject to the same terms and
conditions existing under the IMS 1995 Employee Stock Purchase Plan
immediately prior to the merger, except that when each outstanding option
under the IMS 1995 Employee Stock Purchase Plan is exercised on January 31,
2002, each participant shall be issued shares of Credence common stock instead
of IMS common stock and the purchase price will be the participant's price
pursuant to the terms of the IMS 1995 Employee Stock Purchase Plan, adjusted
as necessary to reflect the exchange ratio of 0.90. The IMS 1995 Employee
Stock Purchase Plan will terminate on January 31, 2002 following such purchase
date. IMS employees who presently participate in the IMS 1995 Employee Stock
Purchase Plan and meet the eligibility requirements for participation in
Credence's Employee Stock Purchase Plan will be eligible to participate in the
plan as of the first entry date following January 31, 2002.

 Conditions to the Merger

   Credence's and IMS' respective obligations to complete the merger and the
other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement are subject to the
satisfaction or waiver of each of the following conditions before completion of

merger:

  . Credence's representations and warranties must be true and correct when

merger and the other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement are
subject to the satisfaction, or waiver by Credence, of each of the following
additional conditions before completion of the merger:

  . IMS' representations and warranties must be true and correct when made

any person means any event, matter, change, condition, circumstance, or effect
that is materially adverse to the condition or prospects (financial or
otherwise), properties, assets (including intangible assets), liabilities,
business, operations or results of operations of such person and its
subsidiaries taken as a whole, but disregarding:

    validation systems markets or general changes in economic conditions that
    affect such person and its subsidiaries taken as a whole; or

  . the loss of customers or suppliers, or loss or reduction of orders or
    shipments from customers or suppliers, to the extent those losses arise
    after the date of the merger agreement and are primarily attributable to
    the announcement or pendency of the merger.

 Termination of the Merger Agreement

   At any time prior to the completion of the merger, the merger agreement may
be terminated and the merger abandoned:

  . by mutual consent of the boards of directors of Credence and IMS;

  . by either Credence or IMS, if:

   . the closing shall not have occurred on or before November 16, 2001,
     which final date may at the request of either party, subject to certain
     limitations as set forth in the merger agreement, be extended to
     December 31, 2001 if the closing is delayed due to:

    . the failure of the registration statement relating to the issuance of
      Credence shares in the merger to be declared, or remain, effective or
      the SEC having threatened action or taken steps to challenge that
      effectiveness;

    . the failure to obtain required approvals, consents, or waivers with
      respect to the securities laws or other material consents, waivers,
      or approvals; or

    . the waiting period under the HSR Act shall not have elapsed or
      terminated;

   . any permanent injunction or other order of a court or other competent
     authority preventing the consummation of the merger shall have become
     final and nonappealable; or

   . any required approval of the IMS shareholders shall not have been
     obtained by reason of the failure to obtain the required vote upon a
     vote held at a duly held meeting of shareholders or at any adjournment
     thereof, subject to certain exceptions with respect to IMS as set forth
     in the merger agreement.

  . by Credence, if:

   . unless cured within ten business days of receipt of written notice, IMS
     shall have breached any of its representations or warranties in a
     manner that has a material adverse effect on IMS, or IMS shall have
     breached in any material respect any other obligation;

   . unless cured within ten business days of receipt of written notice,
     IMS' rights plan or Oregon's anti-takeover statute causes a material
     adverse effect in any material respect on the consummation of the
     merger;

   . unless cured within ten business days of receipt of written notice, a
     material adverse effect with respect to IMS, or an event or
     circumstance that could reasonably be expected to result in a material
     adverse effect, shall have occurred;

   . if a trigger event (as further explained below) or takeover proposal
     has occurred and the board of directors of IMS does not within 10
     business days of such occurrence:

    . reconfirm its recommendation, without conditions, of the approval of
      the merger agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby; and

    . reject such takeover proposal or trigger event (in the case of a
      takeover proposal or trigger event involving a tender or exchange
      offer);

   . the IMS board of directors shall have failed to recommend, without
     conditions, that IMS shareholders vote to approve the merger and the
     merger agreement, or shall have withdrawn or modified that
     recommendation in a manner adverse to Credence or shall have resolved
     to do any of the foregoing or shall have failed to reaffirm its
     recommendation within 10 business days of a written request to do so by
     Credence;

   . the IMS board of directors shall have recommended, endorsed, approved,
     accepted or agreed to a takeover proposal, or shall have entered into
     any letter of intent or similar document or agreement relating to a
     takeover proposal, or shall have resolved to do any of the foregoing;

   . any IMS representative shall have solicited, initiated, encouraged,
     facilitated, or entered into any agreement in respect of any takeover
     proposal, or engaged in any discussions or negotiations with, or
     disclosed any nonpublic information relating to IMS or any of its
     subsidiaries to, or afforded access to the properties, books or records
     of IMS or any of its subsidiaries to, any person that has advised IMS
     that it is seeking to make, or that the board of directors in good
     faith understands is seeking to make, or that since the date of the
     merger agreement has made, a takeover proposal, except as permitted by
     the merger agreement;

   . IMS shall have endorsed, approved or recommended any takeover proposal,
     except as permitted by the merger agreement; or

   . IMS shall have failed to take all action necessary to convene the
     special meeting of its shareholders on a date no later than 45 days
     after the registration statement of which this proxy
     statement/prospectus is a part is declared effective, or IMS otherwise
     shall have failed to comply with its obligations to convene the
     shareholder's meeting or solicit votes in favor of the approval of the
     merger;

  . by IMS, if:

   . unless cured within ten business days of receipt of written notice,
     Credence shall have breached any of its representations, warranties in
     a manner that has a material adverse effect on Credence, or Credence
     shall have breached in any material respect any other obligation; or

   . unless cured within ten business days of receipt of written notice, a
     material adverse effect with respect to Credence, or an event or
     circumstance that could reasonably be expected to result in a material
     adverse effect, shall have occurred.

   If the merger agreement is terminated, then it will be of no further effect
and none of the parties to the merger agreement will have any liability or
obligations in respect thereof, except for liabilities relating to:

  . breaches of confidentiality obligations;

  . obligations to pay expenses and termination fees under the merger
    agreement; and

  . breaches of representations, warranties and covenants.

   For purposes of the merger agreement, a "trigger event" occurs if any
person, other than a shareholder party to an enforceable shareholder's
agreement, acquires securities representing 15% or more of the voting power of
IMS, or commences a tender or exchange offer, open market purchase program or
other publicly announced initiative following the successful consummation of
which the offeror and its affiliates would beneficially own securities
representing 15% or more of the voting power of IMS.

   For purposes of the merger agreement, a "takeover proposal" means any
agreement, offer or proposal (whether written or oral) for:

  . a merger, reorganization, share exchange, consolidation, or other
    business combination involving IMS or any of its subsidiaries;

  . a tender offer for IMS;

  . the acquisition of 15% or more of the outstanding shares of any class of
    capital stock of IMS; or

  . the acquisition of a significant portion of the assets of IMS or any of
    its subsidiaries;

other than, in each case, the merger.

 Payment of Termination Fees and Expenses

   Whether or not the merger is consummated, the merger agreement provides that
each party will bear its own costs and expenses incurred in connection with the
merger agreement and the merger, except that the following expenses shall be
shared equally by Credence and IMS:

  . expenses incurred in connection with printing this proxy
    statement/prospectus;

  . registration and filing fees incurred in connection with this proxy
    statement/prospectus;

  . the listing of additional shares;

  . fees, costs and expenses, associated with compliance with applicable
    state securities laws in connection with the merger; and

  . fees, costs and expenses incurred in connection with HSR Act filings.

   In addition to any expenses otherwise payable, IMS is required by the merger
agreement to pay Credence a termination fee of $8 million in the event that
Credence terminates the merger agreement because:

  . a trigger event or takeover proposal has occurred and the board of
    directors of IMS, if requested by Credence, does not within 10 business
    days of that occurrence: (i) reconfirm its recommendation, without
    conditions, of the approval of the merger agreement and the transactions
    contemplated thereby; and (ii) reject the takeover proposal or trigger
    event (in the case of a takeover proposal or trigger event involving a
    tender or exchange offer);

  . the IMS board of directors shall have failed to recommend, without
    conditions, that IMS shareholders vote to approve the merger and the
    merger agreement, or shall have withdrawn or modified or conditioned that
    recommendation in a manner adverse to Credence, or shall have resolved to
    do any of the foregoing, or shall have failed to reaffirm its
    recommendation within 10 business days of a written request to do so by
    Credence;

  . the IMS board of directors shall have recommended, endorsed, approved,
    accepted, or agreed to a takeover proposal, or shall have entered into
    any letter of intent or similar document or agreement relating to a
    takeover proposal, or shall have resolved to do any of the foregoing;

  . any IMS representative shall have solicited, initiated, encouraged,
    facilitated or entered into any agreement in respect of any takeover
    proposal or engaged in any discussions or negotiations with, or disclosed
    any nonpublic information relating to IMS or any of its subsidiaries to,
    or afforded access to the properties, books or records of IMS or any of
    its subsidiaries to, any person that has advised IMS that it is seeking
    to make, or that the board of directors of IMS in good faith understands
    is seeking to make, or that since the date of the merger agreement has
    made, a takeover proposal;

  . IMS shall have endorsed, approved or recommended any takeover proposal,
    except as permitted by the merger agreement; or

  . IMS shall have failed to take all action necessary to convene the special
    meeting of its shareholders on a date no later than 45 days after the
    registration statement of which this proxy statement/prospectus is a part
    is declared effective, or IMS otherwise shall have failed to comply with
    its obligations to convene the shareholders' meeting or solicit votes in
    favor of the approval of the merger.

The payment of that termination fee does not limit any remedies available to
Credence for a willful breach of the merger agreement by IMS or its
subsidiaries.

   In addition to any expenses otherwise payable, IMS is required by the merger
agreement to pay Credence a termination fee of $1 million in the event that
either Credence or IMS terminates the merger agreement because:

  . the closing shall not have occurred on or before November 16, 2001, which
    final date may at the request of either party, subject to certain
    limitations as set forth in the merger agreement, be extended to December
    31, 2001 if the closing is delayed due to:

   . the failure of the registration statement relating to the issuance of
     Credence shares in the merger to be declared, or remain, effective or
     the SEC having threatened action or taken steps to challenge that
     effectiveness;

   . the failure to obtain required approvals, consents, or waivers with
     respect to the securities laws or other material consents, waivers, or
     approvals;

   . the waiting period under the HSR Act shall not have elapsed or
     terminated; or

  . if any required approval of the IMS shareholders shall not have been
    obtained by reason of the failure to obtain the required vote upon a vote
    held at a duly held meeting of shareholders or at any adjournment
    thereof, subject to certain exceptions with respect to IMS as set forth
    in the merger agreement;

and prior to that termination there had been a trigger event or takeover
proposal that has not been withdrawn (or if withdrawn, the withdrawal was not
made early enough as to no longer prejudice the IMS shareholders' consideration
of the merger).

   Further, if within 12 months of a termination entitling payment of the $1
million termination fee described above any takeover proposal or trigger event
is consummated, IMS is required pursuant to the terms of the merger agreement
to pay Credence an additional $7 million. The payment of those termination fees
will not limit any remedies available to Credence for a willful breach of the
merger agreement by IMS or its subsidiaries.

   For purposes of the preceding paragraph, the "consummation" of a takeover
proposal shall occur on the date a definitive written agreement is entered into
with respect to: a merger or other business combination involving IMS, or the
acquisition of 15% or more of the outstanding shares of any class of capital
stock of IMS, or sale or transfer of any material assets (excluding the sale or
disposition of assets in the ordinary course of business) of IMS or any of its
subsidiaries. For purposes of the preceding paragraph, "consummation" of a
trigger event shall occur on the date any person (other than any shareholder
which currently owns 15% or more of the outstanding shares of capital stock of
IMS, provided that such shareholder does not increase its ownership) or any of
its affiliates or associates would beneficially own securities representing 15%
or more of the voting power of IMS, following a tender or exchange offer.

   If Credence terminates the merger agreement because:

  . IMS shall have breached any of its representations or warranties in a
    manner that has a material adverse effect on IMS, or breached in any
    material respect any other obligation; or

  . IMS' rights plan or Oregon's anti-takeover statute causes a material
    adverse effect in any material respect on the consummation of the merger;

IMS is required pursuant to the terms of the merger agreement to reimburse
Credence's out-of-pocket costs and expenses, in an amount not to exceed $1
million. The payment of these costs and expenses will not limit any remedies
available to Credence for a willful breach of the merger agreement by IMS or
its subsidiaries, any of these payments in respect of costs and expenses will
be reduced by the amount of any termination fee paid to Credence and described
above.

   If IMS terminates the merger agreement because:

  . Credence shall have breached any of its representations or warranties in
    a manner that has a material adverse effect on Credence, or breached in
    any material respect any other obligation;

Credence is required pursuant to the terms of the merger agreement to reimburse
IMS' out-of-pocket costs and expenses, in an amount not to exceed $1 million.
The payment of these costs and expenses will not limit any remedies available
to IMS for a willful breach of the merger agreement by Credence or its
subsidiaries.

 No Solicitation of Transactions

   Until the merger is completed or the merger agreement is terminated, IMS has
agreed not to directly or indirectly take any of the following actions:

  . solicit, initiate, encourage, facilitate, or enter into any letter of
    intent or other agreement in respect of any takeover proposal;

  . engage in discussions or negotiations with, or disclose any nonpublic
    information relating to IMS or any of its subsidiaries to, or afford
    access to the properties, books or records of IMS or any of its
    subsidiaries to, any person that has advised IMS that it is seeking to
    make, or that the board of directors of IMS in good faith understands is
    seeking to make, or that since the date of the merger agreement has made,
    a takeover proposal; or

  . endorse, approve or recommend any takeover proposal.

   However, these restrictions do not prevent the board of directors of IMS
from taking and disclosing to the IMS shareholders a position with respect to a
tender offer or otherwise complying with their obligations pursuant to Rules
14d-9 and 14e-2 promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.

   Furthermore, if prior to approval of the merger by IMS' shareholders, IMS
has received an unsolicited written takeover proposal and the board of
directors of IMS:

  . believes in good faith in the proper exercise of their fiduciary duties
    and after receiving advice from their financial advisors and taking into
    account all of the terms of the proposal including the likelihood and
    timing of the consummation of such proposal, that such proposal will
    result in a transaction more favorable than the merger to the IMS
    shareholders from a financial point of view (any such proposal being
    referred to in the merger agreement as a "superior proposal"); and

  . determines in good faith, after consultation with outside legal counsel,
    that it is necessary for the board in order to comply with its fiduciary
    duties to the shareholders of IMS under applicable law;

then IMS, or its representatives, may:

  . furnish information to the person making such superior proposal and
    disclose to such person non-public information concerning IMS and its
    subsidiaries, provided that any such disclosure is made on terms at least
    as restrictive as those contained in the confidentiality agreement
    entered between IMS and Credence;

  . engage in negotiations with the person making such superior proposal;

  . endorse, or approve, or recommend the superior proposal; or

  . withdraw, condition or modify its recommendation of the approval of the
    merger.

   IMS is obligated to immediately notify Credence of the receipt of any
takeover proposal or requests for access to information, books or records or
non-public information from any person who has advised IMS that it is intending
to make, or has made a takeover proposal or whose efforts to formulate a
takeover proposal would be assisted thereby.

   IMS is further obligated to inform Credence of its determination that there
is a superior proposal, to provide true and complete copies of the superior
proposal and also to provide copies of all non-public information or documents
provided to the person making the superior proposal, and to keep Credence
informed of the status of the superior proposal. Additionally, IMS is required
to give Credence at least three days prior notice of any decision to endorse or
recommend a superior proposal or to withdraw, condition or modify its
recommendation of the merger.

   By executing the merger agreement, IMS has also agreed that it will end any
discussion of takeover proposals, with anyone other than Credence, existing at
the date of the merger agreement.

 Extension, Waiver and Amendment of the Merger Agreement

   The board of directors of either party may amend the merger agreement at any
time by execution of a written amendment signed on behalf of each of the
parties to the merger agreement. In addition, at any time prior to the
completion of the merger, either party may:

  . extend the other's time for the performance of any of the obligations or
    other acts under the merger agreement;

  . waive any inaccuracies in the other's representations and warranties; and

  . waive compliance by the other with any of the agreements or conditions
    contained in the merger agreement.

 Further Assurances

   Both IMS and Credence are required to use their respective reasonable best
efforts to fulfill the conditions to closing of the merger, to effectuate the
transactions contemplated by the merger agreement and to provide such documents
and do such things as may be reasonably required by the other party for such
purposes and to consummate the merger.

 Benefit Plans and Programs

   Credence and IMS intend that employees of IMS and its subsidiaries after the
merger will have substantially similar benefits, by either continuing in
current IMS plans or participating in Credence's benefit plans and programs.
Participation in Credence benefit plans would be on the same terms applicable
to similarly situated employees of Credence and to the extent that such plans
and programs provide the following benefits:

  . medical/dental/vision care;

  . life insurance;

  . disability income;

  . sick pay;

  . holiday and vacation pay;

  . 401(k) plan coverage;

  . Internal Revenue Code Section 125 benefit arrangements

  . bonus, profit-sharing or other incentive plans;

  . pension or retirement programs, including a nonqualified deferred
    compensation program;

  . dependent care assistance; and

  . severance benefits.

   Each employee of IMS will be given credit, for purposes of any service
requirements for participation in Credence benefit plans or programs or
vesting, for his or her period of service with IMS or any of its subsidiaries
credited under a similar plan prior to completion of the merger, subject to
appropriate break in service rules. Each continuing employee will, with respect
to any Credence plans or programs which have co-payment, deductible or other
co-insurance features, receive credit for any amounts such individual has paid
to date in the plan year of the merger under comparable plans or programs
maintained by IMS or any of its subsidiaries prior to the merger.

   Each employee of IMS and eligible dependent who, upon completion of the
merger, was participating in an employee group health plan maintained by IMS or
any of its subsidiaries will not be excluded from Credence's employee group
health plan or limited in coverage thereunder by reason of any waiting period
restriction or pre-existing condition limitation. Unless Credence consents, IMS
is required to take all action necessary to terminate, or cause to terminate,
before the completion of the merger, any IMS benefit plan that is a 401(k) plan
or other defined contribution retirement plan.

Related Agreements

 Shareholder Agreement

   In connection with the merger, Cadence has entered into a shareholder
agreement with Credence. The terms of the shareholder agreement provides that
Cadence will vote all shares of IMS common stock beneficially owned by it in
favor of the approval of the merger agreement and requires Cadence to vote
against any other takeover proposals. The shareholder agreement terminates of
the earlier of the completion of the merger or the termination of the merger
agreement pursuant to its terms.

   The shareholder agreement also requires Cadence to deliver an irrevocable
proxy to Credence. The irrevocable proxy enables Credence to vote Cadence's
shares to approve the merger and enables Credence to vote Cadence's shares
against any other takeover proposals. As of the date of this proxy
statement/prospectus, Cadence beneficially owned 2,559,000 shares (exclusive of
any shares issuable upon the exercise of options or warrants held by any
officer, director or employee of Cadence) of IMS common stock, which
represented approximately 32% of the outstanding IMS common stock as of the
record date.

 Amendment to IMS Shareholder Rights Agreement

   In connection with the merger agreement, IMS executed an amendment to its
rights agreement, dated March 25, 1998, by and between IMS and Mellon Investor
Services, LLC (formerly ChaseMellon Shareholder Services, LLC) (the "rights
agreement") pursuant to which Credence, Iguana Acquisition Corporation and
Cadence shall not be deemed Acquiring Persons (as defined in the rights
agreement) under the terms of the rights agreement by virtue of the approval,
execution, delivery, or performance of the merger agreement or the shareholder
agreement and pursuant to which the execution, delivery and the performance of
the merger agreement or shareholder agreement shall not result in a
Distribution Date (as defined in the rights agreement).

Operations Following the Merger

   Following the merger, IMS will continue its operations as a wholly-owned
subsidiary of Credence. Upon consummation of the merger, the members of IMS'
board of directors will be Graham J. Siddall, John R.

Detwiler and Keith L. Barnes. The membership of the Credence board of directors
will remain unchanged as a result of the merger. Following the merger, the
officers of IMS will be Mr. Barnes (President), Fred Hall (Vice President-
Finance) and Mr. Detwiler (Vice President and Assistant Secretary). The
shareholders of IMS will become stockholders of Credence, and their rights as
stockholders will be governed by Credence's certificate of incorporation and
bylaws and the laws of the State of Delaware. The day-to-day operations of IMS
following the merger will be the responsibility of its officers and directors.
In addition, provided certain ongoing revenue target levels are met or
exceeded, it is the intention of Credence to maintain existing headcount and
compensation levels of IMS employees.

   It is the current intent of Credence and IMS that the existing headoffice of
IMS at Gemini Drive, Beaverton, Oregon, will be maintained as the headoffice of
IMS following the merger through February 29, 2004, the end of the current term
of the lease of such premises, and that headoffice employees of IMS will not be
relocated without either their approval or the unanimous approval of the board
of directors of IMS. It is the intention of the parties that IMS will continue
to use its existing brands on its current products following the merger.

Indemnification of Officers and Directors and Liability Insurance

   The merger agreement provides that all rights to indemnification existing in
favor of directors and officers of IMS as of the date of the merger agreement
for their acts and omissions occurring prior to the completion of the merger
will survive the merger and will be observed by the surviving corporation to
the fullest extent available under Oregon law for a period of six years. The
articles of incorporation and the bylaws of the surviving corporation will also
continue for a period of six years (subject to restrictions under applicable
law) to contain provisions with respect to exculpation and indemnification of
officers and directors at least as favorable overall to those persons as the
provisions contained in IMS' current articles of incorporation and bylaws.

   In addition, the merger agreement provides that for a period of six years
after the completion of the merger, the surviving corporation will maintain,
for the benefit of the directors and officers of IMS as of the date of the
mergers with respect to their acts and omissions, in their capacities as
directors and officers of IMS occurring prior to completion of the merger,
directors' and officers' liability insurance on terms comparable to those
maintained by IMS as of the date of the merger agreement.

Interests of IMS Directors, Officers and Affiliates in the Merger

   In considering the recommendation of the IMS board of directors, you should
be aware that certain directors and officers of IMS have interests in the
merger which are different from, or in addition to, yours. The IMS board of
directors was aware of these potential conflicts when considering their
approval and recommendation of the merger. These interests include the
following:

  . As of June 4, 2001, directors, executive officers and affiliates of IMS
    (including Cadence) held approximately 34% of the outstanding shares of
    IMS common stock entitled to vote.

  . As of June 4, 2001, non-employee directors of IMS beneficially owned
    stock options, vested and unvested, to purchase an aggregate of 204,722
    shares of IMS common stock. The merger agreement requires all members of
    IMS' board of directors other than Keith L. Barnes to resign from the
    board as of completion of the merger. Each of the directors who are
    required to resign have existing consulting and indemnity agreements with
    IMS which provide that upon resignation from the board of directors as
    part of IMS' process of merging with another entity, IMS remains
    obligated to continue to engage the director as a consultant. Upon
    completion of the merger, the following non-employee directors will be
    offered the opportunity to consult for IMS. The following chart
    indicates, as of June 4, 2001, the number of unvested options held by the
    six non-employee directors, however this number will decrease

   monthly (next on June 30, 2001) as unvested options vest automatically in
   accordance with the terms of the stock options plans pursuant to which
   those options were originally granted:

  . As of June 4, 2001, executive officers (including the only employee
    director, Keith L. Barnes) beneficially owned stock options (some of
    which are vested and unexercised, and the balance of which are unvested)
    to purchase an aggregate of 1,109,025 shares of IMS common stock. Upon
    completion of the merger, the portion of unvested stock options noted
    held by the following executive officers will accelerate and become fully
    vested and exercisable upon existing employment agreements as shown
    below:

                                                            % of All Unvested

      Fred Hall......................        87,080                100%

  . Two officers of IMS, W. Barry Baril, Chief Technical Officer, and Gwyn
    Harvey, Vice President of Human Resources, have existing employment
    agreements with IMS that provide that in the event such officer's
    employment is terminated without cause within one year after a sale of a
    majority of the voting stock of IMS, then the vesting of IMS options held
    by the officer will accelerate. If the employment of Mr. Baril or Ms.
    Harvey were to be terminated without cause within one year following
    completion of the merger, their unvested options totaling, as of June 4,
    2001 56,246 shares and 22,227 shares, respectively, will immediately vest
    and become exercisable.

  . Following completion of the merger, Credence intends to grant an
    aggregate of 250,000 options to purchase shares of Credence common stock
    to certain employees of IMS, including certain of its executive officers,
    as shown below:

                                                                   # of Credence

      Michael Evon............................. VP Worldwide Sales     7,500

  . The acceleration of the vesting of options upon the merger and any other
    payments in the nature of compensation to certain employees or
    independent contractors of IMS that are contingent upon or made in
    connection with the merger may result in "excess parachute payments" as
    defined in Section 280G of the Internal Revenue Code. Excess parachute
    payments are not deductible in accordance with Section 280G. As a result,
    neither Credence nor IMS will be entitled to a tax deduction for the
    amounts determined to be excess parachute payments. The amount of the
    lost deduction will depend, in part, on the value of the shares at the
    time of the merger, the number of option shares being accelerated, and
    the amount of any other payments in the nature of compensation that are
    contingent upon or deemed to be made in connection with the merger. Any
    payments required to be made pursuant to Section 280G of the Code will be
    treated as transaction expenses. In accordance with Section 4999 of the
    Internal

   Revenue Code, the employee or independent contractor that receives an
   excess parachute payment must pay a federal excise tax (in addition to all
   other income taxes imposed on the payment) equal to 20% of the amount of
   the excess parachute payment.

  . IMS, based on advice from an outside consultant, has conducted an
    analysis to ascertain whether any payments or acceleration of options
    made to Keith L. Barnes, Fred Hall or Donald E. Grant could result in
    excess parachute payments under Section 280G. IMS believes that as a
    result of its analysis, no excess parachute payments would be made as a
    result of the merger. This result could change, however, if the trading
    price of IMS common stock subject to the accelerated stock options
    exceeded $23 per share, in the case of Mr. Grant, or $24 per share, in
    the case of either Mr. Barnes or Mr. Hall.

  . The merger agreement provides for the continuation of indemnification
    arrangements in favor of and maintenance of insurance coverage in respect
    of, directors and officers of IMS for their acts and omissions occurring
    prior to the completion of the merger. Please see the section above
    entitled "Indemnification of Officers and Directors and Liability
    Insurance" on page 67 of this proxy statement/prospectus.

Antitrust Approval

   The merger is subject to the requirements of the HSR Act. The HSR Act
requires both parties to file written notification of the proposed merger with
the Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice and the Federal Trade
Commission, and to provide each of those agencies with certain information and
documentary materials for their review. The HSR Act also prohibits the parties
from closing the merger transaction until certain waiting periods end or
expire. The initial waiting period is 30 days after both parties have made
their written filings and provided the information and documentary materials
required.

   Credence and IMS expect to make their HSR Act filings on June 6, 2001, and
the initial waiting period therefore will expire at 11:59 p.m. Eastern
Daylight Time on July 6, 2001. The requirements of the HSR Act will be
satisfied if the merger is completed within one year from the termination of
the waiting period.

   However, the Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice or the Federal
Trade Commission may issue, during the initial waiting period, a second
request to the parties, requiring them to submit additional information and
documentary materials. If such a second request were to be issued, it would
extend the waiting period until a date 30 days after Credence and IMS
substantially complied with their obligations under the second request.

   In addition, the Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice or the
Federal Trade Commission could challenge the merger on antitrust grounds
either before or after expiration of the waiting period. Accordingly, at any
time before or after the completion of the merger, either the Antitrust
Division of the Department of Justice or the Federal Trade Commission could
take action under the antitrust laws as it deems necessary or desirable in the
public interest, or other persons could take action under the antitrust laws,
including seeking to enjoin the merger. Additionally, at any time before or
after the completion of the merger, notwithstanding that the applicable
waiting period expired or ended, any state could take action under the
antitrust laws as it deems necessary or desirable in the public interest.
There can be no assurance that a challenge to the merger will not be made or
that, if a challenge is made, we will be successful in opposing it.

   In addition, Credence and IMS may need to obtain approval for the merger in
foreign jurisdictions depending upon the extent to which IMS and/or Credence
conducts business in these jurisdictions and the statutory requirements of
each of these jurisdictions.

Material Federal Income Tax Considerations

   The following discussion describes the material United States federal
income tax considerations that are generally applicable to holders of IMS
common stock who exchange IMS common stock for Credence common stock pursuant
to the merger and does not purport to be a complete analysis or listing of all
potential

tax considerations relevant to a decision whether to vote in favor of the
merger. This discussion is based on currently existing provisions of the
Internal Revenue Code, existing and proposed Treasury regulations promulgated
thereunder and current administrative rulings and court decisions, all of which
are subject to change. Any change, which may or may not be retroactive, could
alter the tax consequences to IMS shareholders as described herein.

   IMS shareholders should be aware that this discussion does not deal with all
federal income tax considerations that may be relevant to particular IMS
shareholders in light of their particular circumstances, such as shareholders
who:

  . are dealers in securities;

  . are subject to the alternative minimum tax provisions of the Internal
    Revenue Code;

  . are foreign persons; or

  . acquired their shares in connection with stock option or stock purchase
    plans or in other compensatory transactions.

   In addition, the following discussion does not address the tax consequences
of the merger under foreign, state or local tax laws, the tax consequences of
transactions effectuated prior or subsequent to, or concurrently with, the
merger (whether or not any such transactions are undertaken in connection with
the merger), including without limitation any transaction in which shares of
IMS common stock are acquired or shares of Credence common stock are disposed
of, the tax consequences of the assumption by Credence of the outstanding IMS
stock options or the tax consequences of the receipt of rights to acquire
Credence common stock. Accordingly, IMS SHAREHOLDERS ARE URGED TO CONSULT THEIR
OWN TAX ADVISORS AS TO THE SPECIFIC TAX CONSEQUENCES TO THEM OF THE MERGER,
INCLUDING THE APPLICABLE FEDERAL, STATE, LOCAL AND FOREIGN TAX CONSEQUENCES.

   The merger is intended to constitute a reorganization within the meaning of
Section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code. If the merger does qualify as a
reorganization, then, subject to the limitations and qualifications referred to
herein, the merger will generally result in the following federal income tax
consequences to the IMS shareholders:

  . no gain or loss will be recognized by holders of IMS common stock solely
    upon their receipt of Credence common stock in exchange for IMS common
    stock in the merger (except to the extent of cash received in lieu of a
    fractional share of Credence common stock);

  . the aggregate tax basis of the Credence common stock received by IMS
    shareholders in the merger (including any tax basis attributable to
    fractional shares deemed to be disposed of) will be the same as the
    aggregate tax basis of the IMS common stock surrendered in exchange
    therefor;

  . the holding period of the Credence common stock received by each IMS
    shareholder in the merger will include the period for which the IMS
    common stock surrendered in exchange therefor was considered to be held,
    provided that the IMS common stock so surrendered is held as a capital
    asset at the time of the merger; and

  . cash payments received by holders of IMS common stock in lieu of a
    fractional share will be treated as if the fractional share of Credence
    common stock had been issued in the merger and then redeemed by Credence.
    An IMS shareholder receiving cash payments will recognize gain or loss,
    upon payment, measured by the difference, if any, between the amount of
    cash received and that shareholder's basis in the fractional share.

   The parties are not requesting and will not request a ruling from the
Internal Revenue Service as to the tax consequences of the merger. The
consummation of the merger is conditioned on the receipt by Credence of an
opinion from Brobeck, Phleger & Harrison LLP and the receipt by IMS of an
opinion from Ater Wynne LLP

to the effect that the merger will constitute a reorganization within the
meaning of Section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code. IMS shareholders should
be aware that the tax opinions do not bind the Internal Revenue Service, and
the Internal Revenue Service is, therefore, not precluded from successfully
asserting a contrary opinion. The tax opinions will be subject to certain
assumptions and qualifications, including the truth and accuracy of certain
representations made by Credence, IMS and Iguana Acquisition Corporation.

   A successful Internal Revenue Service challenge to the reorganization status
of the merger would result in IMS shareholders recognizing taxable gain or loss
with respect to each share of common stock of IMS surrendered equal to the
difference between the shareholder's basis in the share and the sum of the
amount of cash, if any, and the fair market value, as of completion of the
merger, of the Credence common stock received in exchange therefor. In this
event, a shareholder's aggregate basis in the Credence common stock so received
would equal its fair market value, and the shareholder's capital gains holding
period for such stock would begin the day after the merger.

Accounting Treatment

   Credence intends to account for the merger as a pooling of interests
business combination and the parties have agreed to use their reasonable best
efforts to cause the merger to be accounted for in this manner. Additionally,
IMS has agreed to use its reasonable best efforts to obtain from its
accountants, Arthur Andersen LLC, confirmation that IMS qualifies as a party to
a merger to be accounted for as a pooling of interests business combination.
Although Credence intends to account for the merger as a pooling of interests
business combination, that accounting treatment is not a condition to
completion of the merger.

No Dissenters' Rights

   You are not entitled to exercise dissenters' rights as a result of the
merger or to demand payment for your shares under Oregon law.

Restrictions on Sale of Shares by Affiliates of IMS

   The shares of Credence common stock to be issued in connection with the
merger will be registered under the Securities Act and will be freely
transferable under the Securities Act, except for shares of Credence common
stock issued to any person who is deemed to be an affiliate of IMS at the time
of the special shareholders meeting. Persons who may be deemed to be affiliates
include individuals or entities that control, are controlled by, or are under
common control of IMS and may include some of IMS' officers and directors, as
well as its principal shareholders. Affiliates may not sell their shares of
Credence common stock acquired in connection with the merger except pursuant
to:

  . an effective registration statement under the Securities Act covering the
    resale of those shares;

  . an exemption under paragraph (d) of Rule 145 under the Securities Act; or

  . another applicable exemption under the Securities Act.

   Credence's registration statement on Form S-4, of which this proxy
statement/prospectus forms a part, does not cover the resale of shares of
Credence common stock to be received by affiliates in the merger. Credence has
offered limited registration rights to certain parties who may be deemed to be
affiliates of IMS which may be utilized if those affiliates are unable to sell
their shares of Credence common stock acquired in the merger under Rules 144
and 145 under the Securities Act. In addition, in connection with accounting
for the merger as a pooling-of-interests, IMS' affiliates will not be able to
sell their shares of Credence common stock received in the merger from the date
beginning 30 days prior to the completion of the merger until Credence releases
earnings containing at least 30 days of earnings of the combined company.

                  COMPARISON OF RIGHTS OF SHAREHOLDERS OF IMS
                          AND STOCKHOLDERS OF CREDENCE

   The following discussion of certain similarities and material differences
between the rights of Credence stockholders and the rights of IMS shareholders
under their respective certificate/articles of incorporation and bylaws is only
a summary of certain provisions and does not purport to be a complete
description of the similarities and differences, and is qualified in its
entirety by reference to the Delaware law and the Oregon law and the full text
of the certificate/articles of incorporation and bylaws of each of Credence and
IMS.

   This section of the proxy statement/prospectus describes certain differences
between the rights of holders of Credence common stock and IMS common stock.
While we believe that the description covers the material differences between
the two, this summary may not contain all of the information that is important
to you. You should carefully read this entire document and the other documents
we refer to for a more complete understanding of the differences between being
a stockholder of Credence and being a shareholder of IMS . When reading this
description, please note that Delaware law refers to holders of common stock as
stockholders while Oregon law uses the term shareholder. The two terms mean the
same thing in practice and for all practical purposes may be used
interchangeably; however, we generally have used the term "stockholder" when
referring to holders of Credence common stock or to Delaware law and
"shareholder" when referring to holders of IMS common stock or to Oregon law.

   As a shareholder of IMS, your rights are governed by IMS' amended and
restated articles of incorporation and IMS' second restated bylaws. After
completion of the merger, you will become a stockholder of Credence. As a
Credence stockholder, your rights will be governed by Credence's amended and
restated certificate of incorporation and Credence's bylaws. In addition,
Credence is incorporated in Delaware while IMS is incorporated in Oregon.
Although the rights and privileges of stockholders of a Delaware corporation
are in many instances comparable to those of shareholders of an Oregon
corporation, there are also differences.

Power to Call Special Meetings of Shareholders

   Under Delaware law, a special meeting of stockholders may be called by the
board of directors or any other person as may be provided in the certificate of
incorporation or bylaws. The Credence bylaws provide that special meetings of
the stockholders may be called at any time by a majority of the board of
directors, the President, or by stockholders owning at least 10% in amount of
the entire capital stock of Credence issued and outstanding and entitled to
vote.

   Under Oregon law, a special meeting of shareholders may be called by the
board of directors or by any other person authorized to do so in the articles
of incorporation or the bylaws, or by written demand by the holders of at least
10% of all votes entitled to be cast on any issue proposed to be considered at
any such meeting. The IMS bylaws provide that a special meeting of shareholders
may be called at any time by the board of directors, the President, or by the
holders of not less than 10% of the outstanding shares entitled to vote at the
meeting.

Shareholder Action without a Meeting

   Under Delaware law, unless otherwise provided in the certificate of
incorporation, any action which may be taken at a meeting of the stockholders
may also be taken without a meeting and without prior notice of a meeting if a
consent in writing is obtained. This consent needs to be signed by holders of
outstanding shares having at least the minimum number of votes that would be
necessary to take such action at a meeting at which all shares entitled to vote
thereon were present and voted. However, the Credence certificate of
incorporation modifies this general rule and specifically provides that no
action shall be taken by the stockholders except at an annual or special
meeting called in accordance with the bylaws.

   Under Oregon law and the IMS bylaws, any action required or permitted to be
taken at a meeting of the shareholders may be taken without a meeting if a
consent in writing is signed by all shareholders entitled to vote on the
action.

Bylaws

   Under Delaware law, a corporation's bylaws may be adopted, amended or
repealed by the stockholders of the corporation. However, under Delaware law, a
corporation may also, in its certificate of incorporation, confer the power to
adopt, amend, or repeal the bylaws upon the directors, subject to the
stockholders' right to do the same and the Credence certificate of
incorporation so provides.

   Under Oregon law, a corporation's bylaws may be adopted, amended or repealed
either by the board of directors or the stockholders of the corporation, unless
the corporation's articles of incorporation provide that the stockholders
solely have the power to amend or repeal the bylaws, or the stockholders, in
amending or repealing a particular bylaw, provide expressly that the board of
directors may not amend or repeal that bylaw. The IMS articles of incorporation
do not restrict the power to amend or repeal any bylaws solely to the
shareholders and consequently the IMS board of directors may also amend, repeal
and adopt bylaws, subject to repeal or change by action of the stockholders.

Size of the Board of Directors

   Under Delaware law, the number of directors is fixed by, or in the manner
provided for in, the bylaws, unless the certificate of incorporation fixes the
number of directors. The Credence certificate of incorporation provides that
the number of directors shall be designated in the bylaws. Credence currently
has six directors and the size of the board can be changed by the board without
a stockholder vote.

   Under Oregon law, the number of directors may be fixed in either the
articles of incorporation or bylaws. The board of directors or the shareholders
of an Oregon corporation may change the number of directors (within any minimum
and maximum range established by the articles of incorporation or bylaws). If
the articles of incorporation establish a fixed or variable range, then, after
shares are issued, only the shareholders may change the range for the size of
the board or change from a fixed or variable-ranged size board by amendment to
the corporation's articles of incorporation. The articles of incorporation of
IMS do not currently specify the number of directors. The IMS bylaws currently
provide that IMS shall have not less than three nor more than twelve directors,
with the IMS board of directors having the right to set the specific number by
resolution. Currently IMS has seven directors.

Classification of the Board of Directors

   A classified board is one in which a certain number of directors, but not
necessarily all, are elected on a rotating basis each year. Delaware law
permits, but does not require, a classified board of directors, in which the
directors can be divided into as many as three classes with staggered terms of
office, with only one class of directors standing for election each year. The
Credence certificate of incorporation and bylaws provide for three classes of
directors with staggered three-year terms.

   If there are six or more directors, Oregon law permits, but does not
require, an Oregon corporation to provide in its articles of incorporation or
bylaws for a classified board of directors, in which the directors can be
divided into up to three classes of directors with staggered terms of office,
with only one class of directors standing for election each year. The IMS
bylaws provide, in the event the number of directors is six or more, for three
classes of directors with staggered three-year terms. Currently, IMS has seven
directors.

Cumulative Voting

   In an election of directors under cumulative voting, each share of stock
normally having one vote is entitled to a number of votes equal to the number
of directors to be elected. A shareholder/stockholder may

then cast all such votes for a single candidate or may allocate them among as
many candidates as the shareholder/stockholder may choose. Without cumulative
voting, the holders of a majority of the shares present at an annual meeting or
any special meeting held to elect directors would have the power to elect all
the directors to be elected at that meeting, and no person could be elected
without the support of holders of a majority of the shares voting at such
meeting. Under Delaware law, cumulative voting in the election of directors is
not mandatory but is a permitted option. The Credence certificate of
incorporation and bylaws do not permit cumulative voting. Under Oregon law,
shareholders do not have a right to cumulative voting unless the articles of
incorporation provide otherwise. The IMS articles of incorporation do not
provide for cumulative voting.

Dissenters' and Appraisal Rights

   Under Oregon law and Delaware law, a shareholder/stockholder of a
corporation engaging in certain major corporate transactions (such as business
combinations) may, under various circumstances, be entitled to dissenters'
rights/appraisal rights pursuant to which such shareholder/stockholder may
receive cash in the amount of the fair value of the shares held by such
shareholder/stockholder, as determined by a court or by agreement of the
corporation and the shareholder/stockholder. This payment is made instead of
the consideration such shareholder/stockholder would otherwise receive in the
relevant corporate transaction.

   Under Delaware law, the fair value of shares is determined without regard to
any value arising from the accomplishment or expectation of the merger or
consolidation. Under Delaware law, appraisal rights are not available in the
following situations:

  . with respect to a merger or consolidation by a corporation the shares of
    which are either listed on a national securities exchange or designated
    as a national market system security or are held of record by more than
    2,000 holders, and if such stockholders receive only shares of the
    surviving corporation, or shares of any other corporation that are either
    listed on a national securities exchange or designated as a national
    market system security or held of record by more than 2,000 holders, plus
    cash in lieu of fractional shares of such corporations; or

  . to stockholders of a corporation or parent corporation surviving a merger
    if no vote of the stockholders of the that corporation is required to
    approve the merger under Delaware law.

   Under Oregon law, unless a corporation's articles of incorporation provide
otherwise, dissenters' rights are generally not available to holders of shares
of any class or series of stock in connection with a merger if the shares of
the class or series were registered on a national securities exchange or quoted
on Nasdaq as a national market system security on the record date for the
meeting at which the merger is to be approved or on the date a copy or summary
of the plan of merger is mailed to the shareholders. IMS' articles of
incorporation do not provide otherwise.

   Dissenters' rights are not available to the IMS shareholders with respect to
the merger between IMS and Credence.

Special Meetings of the Board of Directors

   Under the Credence bylaws, meetings of Credence's board of directors may be
called by the President, or any two directors. Notice is required to be given
two days in advance.

   Oregon law provides that, unless the articles of incorporation or bylaws set
forth a longer or shorter period, special meetings of a corporation's board of
directors must be preceded by at least two days' notice of the date, time and
place of the meeting. The IMS bylaws stipulate that special meetings of the
board of directors may be called by the President or any director then in
office. Notice is required to be given three days in advance by any means
provided by law.

Dividends and Repurchases of Shares

   Delaware law permits a corporation, subject to any restrictions contained in
its certificate of incorporation, to declare and pay dividends out of capital
surplus or, if there is no capital surplus, out of net profits for the fiscal
year in which the dividend is declared and/or for the preceding fiscal year.
However, the directors of a corporation may not pay any dividends out of net
profits if the capital of the corporation has been diminished by depreciation
in the value of its property, or by losses, or otherwise, to an amount less
than the aggregate amount of capital represented by the issued and outstanding
stock of all classes having a preference upon the distribution of assets.
Capital is determined by the board of directors, but may not be less than the
aggregate par value of the outstanding capital stock of the corporation having
par value. In addition, Delaware law generally provides that a corporation may
redeem or repurchase its shares only if the capital of the corporation is not
impaired and the redemption or repurchase would not impair the capital of the
corporation.

   The Credence certificate of incorporation does not allow the corporation to
pay any dividend with respect to the common stock without the prior approval of
the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of preferred stock, if any.
Credence currently does not have any shares of preferred stock outstanding.

   Oregon law permits a corporation, unless otherwise restricted by its
articles of incorporation, to make distributions to its shareholders, if both
of the following factors are, in the judgment of the directors, satisfied:

  . the corporation would be able to pay its debts as they come due in the
    usual course of business; and

  . the corporation's total assets would at least equal the sum of its total
    liabilities plus, unless the articles of incorporation permit otherwise,
    the amount that would be needed if the corporation were dissolved at the
    time of the distribution, to satisfy the preferential rights upon
    dissolution of shareholders whose preferential rights are superior to
    those receiving the distribution.

   The IMS articles of incorporation do not otherwise restrict the ability of
its board of directors to make distributions to its shareholders. In addition,
Oregon law generally provides that a corporation may redeem or repurchase its
shares.

Derivative Actions

   Derivative actions may be brought under Delaware law by a stockholder on
behalf of, and for the benefit of, the corporation, if the stockholder was a
stockholder, or received stock by operation of law from someone who was a
stockholder, of the corporation at the time of the transaction of which he or
she complains. A stockholder may not sue derivatively unless he first makes
demand on the corporation that it bring suit and such demand has been refused,
unless it is shown that such demand would have been futile.

   Oregon law provides that a shareholder bringing a derivative action on
behalf of the corporation must have been a shareholder, or received shares
through transfer by operation of law from someone who was a shareholder, at the
time of the transaction in question. A complaint in a proceeding brought in the
right of a corporation must allege with particularity the demand made, if any,
to obtain action by the board of directors and either that the demand was
refused or ignored or why a demand was not made. Whether or not a demand for
action was made, if the corporation commences an investigation of the charges
made in the complaint, the court may stay any proceeding until the
investigation is completed.

Limitation of Liability of Directors; Indemnification

   Under the Credence certificate of incorporation, directors are indemnified
by the corporation or its stockholders for monetary damages for breach of
fiduciary duty as a director, except for liability:

  . for any breach of the director's duty of loyalty to the corporation or
    its stockholders;

  . for acts or omissions not in good faith or which involve intentional
    misconduct or a knowing violation of law;

  . for which indemnification is prohibited by Delaware law; or

  . for any transaction from which the director derived any improper personal
    benefit.

   Delaware law also generally permits indemnification of expenses, including
attorneys' fees, actually and reasonably incurred in the defense or settlement
of a derivative or third-party action, provided there is a determination by a
majority vote of disinterested directors, by a committee of directors
designated by a majority of the directors, by independent legal counsel in a
written opinion, or by the stockholders that the person seeking indemnification
acted in good faith and in a manner reasonably believed to be in best interests
of the corporation and, with respect to a criminal action, had no reasonable
cause to believe his conduct was unlawful. Without court approval, however, no
indemnification may be made in respect of any derivative action in which such
person is adjudged liable to the corporation. Delaware law requires
indemnification of expenses to the extent the individual being indemnified has
successfully defended any action, claim, issue or matter therein, on the merits
or otherwise.

   Expenses incurred by an officer or director in defending any action may be
paid in advance, under Delaware law, if such director or officer undertakes to
repay such amounts if it is ultimately determined that he or she is not
entitled to indemnification. In addition, Delaware law authorizes a
corporation's purchase of indemnity insurance for the benefit of its officers,
directors, employees and agents whether or not the corporation would have the
power to indemnify against the liability covered by the policy.

   The indemnification and expense advancement provisions under Delaware law
described above are not exclusive of other rights of indemnification and
advancement that a director or officer may be granted by a corporation in its
bylaws, by agreement, or by a stockholder vote or vote of disinterested
directors.

   Under Oregon law, a corporation's articles of incorporation may set forth a
provision eliminating or limiting the personal liability of a director to the
corporation or its shareholders for monetary damages for conduct as a director.
However, such provisions may not eliminate or limit a director's liability for:

  . any act or omission occurring prior to the date when such provision
    becomes effective;

  . breaches of the director's duty of loyalty to the corporation or its
    shareholders;

  . acts or omissions not in good faith or which involve intentional
    misconduct or a knowing violation of the law;

  . the payment of unlawful distributions; or

  . any transaction from which the director derived an improper personal
    benefit.

   The IMS articles of incorporation contain provisions eliminating a
director's or officer's liability to the fullest extent permitted by Oregon
law.

   Under Oregon law, a corporation may, subject to the limitations described
below, indemnify a director against liability incurred if the conduct was in
good faith, the individual reasonably believed the individual's conduct was in
the best interests of the corporation, or at least not opposed to its best
interests and, in the case of a criminal proceeding, the individual had no
reasonable cause to believe the conduct was unlawful. Under Oregon law, a
director may not be indemnified in connection with a proceeding by or in the
right of the corporation in which the director was found liable to the
corporation or in connection with any other proceeding charging improper
personal benefit to the director in which the director was found liable on the
basis that personal benefit was improperly received. Oregon law provides for
mandatory indemnification of directors when the indemnified party is wholly
successful on the merits or otherwise in the defense of any proceeding to which
the director was a party because of being a director.

Inspection of Stockholder List

   Delaware law allows any stockholder to inspect the stockholder list for a
purpose reasonably related to such person's interest as a stockholder. Delaware
law also provides for inspection rights of the list of

stockholders entitled to vote at a meeting within a ten day period preceding a
stockholders' meeting for any purpose germane to the meeting.

   Oregon law allows any shareholder to inspect the shareholder list for a
proper purpose upon five days written notice to the corporation of such
request. Oregon law also allows any shareholder to inspect the shareholder list
beginning two business days after notice of a meeting is given for which the
list was prepared and continuing through the meeting.

Removal of Directors

   Under Delaware law, any director or the entire board of directors of a
corporation may be removed, with or without cause, with the approval of a
majority of the outstanding shares entitled to vote at an election of
directors, except that unless the certificate of incorporation provides
otherwise, in the case of a classified board, the directors can only be removed
by the stockholders for cause. The Credence certificate of incorporation does
not provide otherwise.

   Under Oregon law, any director of an Oregon corporation may be removed, with
or without cause, by the shareholders unless the articles of incorporation
provide that directors may only be removed for cause. A director may be removed
only if the number of votes cast to remove the director exceed the votes cast
not to remove the director. Furthermore, a director may be removed by the
shareholders only at a meeting called for the purpose of removing the director
and the meeting notice must state that the purpose of the meeting is to remove
a director. The IMS bylaws provide that any or all directors may be removed
only for cause and at a meeting of shareholders called expressly for that
purpose, by the vote of 75% of the votes entitled to be cast for the election
of directors.

Transactions Involving Officers and Directors

   Under Delaware law, any corporation may lend money to, or guarantee any
obligation of, or otherwise assist any officer or other employee of the
corporation, including any officer or employee who is also a director of the
corporation, whenever, in the judgment of the directors, such loan, guaranty,
or assistance may reasonably be expected to benefit the corporation.
Furthermore, under Delaware law, a corporation may enter into contracts or
otherwise engage in transactions with its directors or a corporation of which
any of its directors is also a director, however:

  . the material facts as to the transaction and as to any director's
    relationship or interest needs to be disclosed or known to the board of
    directors, committee of the board of directors or the stockholders
    entitled to vote thereon, and the affirmative vote of a majority of the
    disinterested directors on the board or committee or a majority of the
    stockholders entitled to vote thereon, as applicable, need to approve or
    ratify the transaction in good faith; or

  . the contract or transaction needs to be fair to the corporation at the
    time it was authorized, approved or ratified.

   An Oregon corporation may loan money to, or guarantee any obligation
incurred by, its directors only if either:

  . the particular loan or guarantee is approved by a majority of the votes
    represented by the outstanding voting shares of all classes, voting as a
    single voting group, excluding the voting shares owned by or voted under
    the control of the benefited director; or

  . the board of directors determines such loan or guarantee benefits the
    corporation and the board of directors either approves the specific loan
    or guarantee or a general plan authorizing the loans and guarantees.

   With respect to any other contract or transaction between the corporation
and one or more of its directors, such transactions may be entered into,
however:

  . the material facts of the transaction and the director's interest need to
    be disclosed or made known to the board of directors, committee of the
    board of directors or the shareholders of the corporation entitled to
    vote thereon, and the transaction needs to be approved or ratified by a
    majority of the disinterested directors or by the shareholders; or

  . the contract or transaction needs to be fair to the corporation.

   Oregon law does not specifically regulate loans to officers or employees.

Approval of Certain Corporate Transactions

   Under both Oregon law and Delaware law, with certain exceptions, any merger,
consolidation, or sale of all or substantially all the assets of a corporation
must be approved by the corporation's board of directors and a majority of the
outstanding shares entitled to vote. Credence's certificate of incorporation
does not provide otherwise. IMS' articles of incorporation provide that a
merger, consolidation, or sale of all or substantially all of the assets of IMS
must be approved by 67% of the outstanding shares of the corporation entitled
to vote thereon.

Class Voting in Certain Corporate Transactions

   Under Delaware law, certain amendments of a corporation's certificate of
incorporation must be approved by a majority of the outstanding shares of each
class of stock, without regard to limitations on voting rights. With certain
exceptions, any merger or sale of all or substantially all of the assets of a
corporation must be approved by the holders of a majority of the outstanding
stock of the corporation. Oregon law does not generally require separate class
votes of all voting classes in order to approve charter amendments and sales of
substantially all the corporate assets. Oregon law, however, provides that all
classes of stock vote separately on charter amendments, mergers and share
exchanges that affect the rights of holders of such class of stock.

Business Combinations with Interested Stockholders

   Under Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, a Delaware
corporation is prohibited from engaging in a business combination with an
"interested stockholder," as defined below, for three years following the date
that such person or entity becomes an interested stockholder. With certain
exceptions, an interested stockholder is a person or entity who or which owns,
individually or with or through certain other persons or entities, 15% or more
of the corporation's outstanding voting stock, including any rights to acquire
stock under an option, warrant, agreement, arrangement or understanding, or
upon the exercise of conversion or exchange rights, and stock with respect to
which the person has voting rights only. The three-year moratorium imposed by
Section 203 on business combinations does not apply if one or more of the
following applies:

  . prior to the date on which such stockholder becomes an interested
    stockholder, the board of directors of the subject corporation approves
    either the business combination or the transaction that resulted in the
    person or entity becoming an interested stockholder;

  . upon consummation of the transaction that made him or her an interested
    stockholder, the interested stockholder owns at least 85% of the
    corporation's voting stock outstanding at the time the transaction
    commenced, excluding from the 85% calculation shares owned by directors
    who are also officers of the subject corporation and shares held by
    employee stock plans that do not give employee participants the right to
    decide confidentially whether to accept a tender or exchange offer; or

  . on or after the date such person or entity becomes an interested
    stockholder, the board of directors approves the business combination and
    it is also approved at a stockholder meeting, and not by written consent,
    by 66 2/3% of the outstanding voting stock not owned by the interested
    stockholder.

   Although a Delaware corporation to which Section 203 applies may elect not
to be governed by Section 203, Credence has not made any such election.

   The Oregon Business Corporation Act contains provisions that are essentially
the same as Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law. Although an
Oregon corporation to which these sections apply may elect not to be governed
by them, IMS has not made such election and therefore is subject to these
provisions.

Dissolution

   Under Delaware law, unless the board of directors approves the proposal to
dissolve, the dissolution must be unanimously approved by all the stockholders
entitled to vote thereon. Only if the dissolution is initially approved by the
board of directors may the dissolution be approved by a simply majority of the
outstanding shares of the corporation's stock entitled to vote. In the event of
such a board-initiated dissolution, Delaware law allows a Delaware corporation
to include in its certificate of incorporation a supermajority voting
requirement in connection with dissolutions. The Credence certificate of
incorporation does not contain such a supermajority voting requirement.

   Under Oregon law, a dissolution must either be approved by written consent
of all shareholders or be initiated by the board of directors and, unless the
articles of incorporation or the board requires a greater vote or a vote by
voting groups, approved by a majority of the votes entitled to be cast on the
proposal for dissolution. The IMS articles of incorporation contain a provision
requiring the approval of not less than 67% of the outstanding shares of the
corporation entitled to vote for a dissolution of the company.

Control Share Act

   The Oregon Control Share Act generally provides that a person who acquires
control shares cannot vote the shares unless voting rights are approved by both
a majority of all the votes entitled to be cast by holders of voting shares and
a majority of all votes other than votes of "interested shareholders" entitled
to be cast by holders of voting shares. Delaware law does not contain an
equivalent to the Oregon Control Share Act. The IMS bylaws provide that the
provisions of the Oregon Control Share Act shall not apply to acquisitions of
shares of voting stock of IMS.

                AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER AND REORGANIZATION

   This AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER AND REORGANIZATION (this "Agreement") is
made and entered into as of May 16, 2001, by and among Credence Systems
Corporation, a Delaware corporation ("Parent"), Iguana Acquisition Corporation,
an Oregon corporation ("Merger Sub") and wholly owned subsidiary of Parent, and
Integrated Measurement Systems, Inc., an Oregon corporation ("Company").

                                   RECITALS:

   A. The Boards of Directors of Company, Parent and Merger Sub believe it is
in the best interests of their respective companies and the shareholders of
their respective companies that Company and Merger Sub combine into a single
company through the statutory merger of Merger Sub with and into Company (the
"Merger") and, in furtherance thereof, have approved the Merger.

   B. Pursuant to the Merger, among other things, the outstanding shares of
Company Common Stock, $0.01 par value ("Company Common Stock"), shall be
converted into shares of Parent Common Stock, $0.001 par value ("Parent Common
Stock"), at the rate set forth herein.

   C. Company, Parent and Merger Sub desire to make certain representations and
warranties and other agreements in connection with the Merger.

   D. The parties intend, by executing this Agreement, to adopt a plan of
reorganization within the meaning of Section 368 of the Internal Revenue Code
of 1986, as amended (the "Code"), and to cause the Merger to qualify as a
reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code and use
reasonable best efforts to qualify as a pooling of interests for financial
accounting purposes.

   E. Concurrently with the execution of this Agreement and as an inducement to
Parent and Merger Sub to enter into this Agreement, certain shareholders of
Company have on the date hereof entered into shareholder agreements in the form
attached hereto as Exhibit A (each a "Shareholder Agreement") to vote the
shares of Company Common Stock owned by such persons to approve the Merger.

                                   AGREEMENT:

   NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the covenants and representations set
forth herein, and for other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and
sufficiency of which is hereby acknowledged, the parties hereto agree as
follows:

                                   ARTICLE I

                                   THE MERGER

   1.1 The Merger. At the Effective Time (as defined in Section 1.2) and
subject to and upon the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the Articles of
Merger attached hereto as Exhibit B (the "Articles of Merger") and the
applicable provisions of the Business Corporation Act of the State of Oregon
("Oregon Law"), Merger Sub shall be merged with and into Company, the separate
corporate existence of Merger Sub shall cease and Company shall continue as the
surviving corporation. Company as the surviving corporation after the Merger is
hereinafter sometimes referred to as the "Surviving Corporation."

   1.2 Closing; Effective Time. The closing of the transactions contemplated
hereby (the "Closing") shall take place as soon as practicable (and in any
event not later than two business days) after the satisfaction or waiver of
each of the conditions set forth in Article VI hereof or at such other time as
the parties hereto agree

                                      A1-1

(the "Closing Date"). The Closing shall take place at the offices of Ater Wynne
LLP, 222 S.W. Columbia Street, Suite 1800, Portland, OR 97201-6018, or at such
other location as the parties hereto agree. In connection with the Closing, the
parties hereto shall cause the Merger to be consummated by filing the Articles
of Merger with the Secretary of State of the State of Oregon, in accordance
with the relevant provisions of Oregon Law (the time of the filing of such
document, or such later time as may be agreed to by the parties and set forth
in the Articles of Merger, being the "Effective Time").

   1.3 Effect of the Merger. At the Effective Time, the effect of the Merger
shall be as provided in this Agreement, the Articles of Merger and the
applicable provisions of Oregon Law. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, and subject thereto, at the Effective Time, all title to all real
estate and other property owned Company and Merger Sub shall vest in the
Surviving Corporation, without reversion or impairment, and all obligations,
including contractual, tortious, statutory and administrative obligations,
shall be the obligations of the Surviving Corporation.

   1.4 Articles of Incorporation; Bylaws.

   (a) At the Effective Time, the Articles of Incorporation of Company shall be
amended so as to read in its entirety as set forth in the Plan of Merger
attached to the Articles of Merger and as so amended shall be the Articles of
Incorporation of the Surviving Corporation until thereafter amended as provided
by Oregon Law and such Articles of Incorporation.

   (b) The Bylaws of Merger Sub, as in effect immediately prior to the
Effective Time, shall be the Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation until
thereafter amended.

   1.5 Directors and Officers. At the Effective Time, the directors of the
Surviving Corporation shall be the directors of Merger Sub immediately prior to
the Effective Time and Keith L. Barnes, in each case until their successors are
elected or appointed and qualified or until their earlier resignation or
removal. The officers of the Surviving Corporation shall be Keith L. Barnes,
(President) Fred Hall (Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Secretary)
and John Detwiler (Vice President and Assistant Secretary) until their
respective successors are duly elected or appointed and qualified or until
their earlier resignation or removal.

   1.6 Effect on Capital Stock. By virtue of the Merger and without any action
on the part of Merger Sub, Company or the holders of any of the following
securities:

     (a) Conversion of Company Common Stock. At the Effective Time, subject
  to Section 1.6(f), each share of Company Common Stock issued and
  outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than any shares
  of Company Common Stock to be canceled pursuant to Section 1.6(b)) will be
  canceled and extinguished and be converted automatically into the right to
  receive 0.9 shares of Parent Common Stock (the "Exchange Ratio"). All
  references in this Agreement to Parent Common Stock to be issued pursuant
  to the Merger shall be deemed to include the corresponding rights to
  purchase stock of Parent pursuant to the Rights Agreement dated as of June
  2, 1998 between Parent and BankBoston, N.A. (as Rights Agent).

     (b) Cancellation of Company Common Stock Owned by Parent or Company. At
  the Effective Time, all shares of Company Common Stock that are owned by
  Company as treasury stock and each share of Company Common Stock owned by
  Parent or any direct or indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Parent or of
  Company immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be canceled and
  extinguished without any conversion thereof.

     (c) Company Stock Option Plans. At the Effective Time, Company's 1995
  Stock Incentive Plan, 1995 Stock Option Plan for Non-Employee Directors and
  2000 Nonqualified Stock Option Plan (collectively the "Company Stock Option
  Plans") and all options to purchase Company Common Stock then outstanding
  under the Company Stock Option Plans shall be assumed by Parent in
  accordance with Section 5.9. The Company ESPP (as defined below) shall
  terminate prior to the Effective Time, in accordance with Section 5.9.

                                      A1-2

     (d) Capital Stock of Merger Sub. At the Effective Time, each share of
  common stock, $0.001 par value, of Merger Sub ("Merger Sub Common Stock")
  issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be
  converted into and exchanged for one validly issued, fully paid and
  nonassessable share of common stock of the Surviving Corporation, and the
  Surviving Corporation shall be a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent. Each
  stock certificate of Merger Sub evidencing ownership of any such shares
  shall continue to evidence ownership of such shares of capital stock of the
  Surviving Corporation.

     (e) Adjustments to Exchange Ratio. The Exchange Ratio shall be adjusted
  to reflect fully the effect of any stock split, reverse split, stock
  dividend (including any dividend or distribution of securities convertible
  into Parent Common Stock or Company Common Stock), reorganization,
  recapitalization or other like change with respect to Parent Common Stock
  or Company Common Stock occurring after the date hereof and prior to the
  Effective Time and of any increase in the number of shares of Company
  Common Stock, or securities convertible into or exchangeable for shares of
  Company Common Stock, issued and outstanding after the date hereof relative
  to such number as derived from Section 2.2 hereof (except to the extent of
  stock options granted in accordance with Section 4.2(e)), so as to provide
  holders of Company Common Stock and Parent the same economic effect as
  contemplated by this Agreement prior to such stock split, reverse split,
  stock dividend, reorganization, recapitalization, like change or increase.

     (f) Fractional Shares. No fraction of a share of Parent Common Stock
  will be issued, but in lieu thereof each holder of shares of Company Common
  Stock who would otherwise be entitled to a fraction of a share of Parent
  Common Stock (after aggregating all fractional shares of Parent Common
  Stock to be received by such holder) shall receive from Parent an amount of
  cash (rounded to the nearest whole cent) equal to the product of (i) such
  fraction, multiplied by (ii) the average closing price of a share of Parent
  Common Stock as quoted on The Nasdaq National Market for the ten (10)
  trading days ending on the third full trading day prior to the Effective
  Time.

   1.7 Surrender of Certificates.

   (a) Exchange Agent. Parent's transfer agent shall act as exchange agent (the
"Exchange Agent") in the Merger.

   (b) Parent to Provide Common Stock and Cash. Promptly after the Effective
Time, Parent shall make available to the Exchange Agent for exchange in
accordance with this Article I, through such reasonable procedures as Parent
may adopt, (i) the shares of Parent Common Stock issuable pursuant to Section
1.6(a) in exchange for shares of Company Common Stock outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time (provided that delivery of any shares that are
subject to vesting and/or repurchase rights in favor of Company shall be in
book entry form until such vesting and/or repurchase rights lapse) and (ii)
cash in an amount sufficient to permit payment of cash in lieu of fractional
shares pursuant to Section 1.6(f).

   (c) Exchange Procedures. As soon as reasonably practicable after the
Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall cause to be mailed to each
holder of record of a certificate or certificates (the "Certificates") which
immediately prior to the Effective Time represented outstanding shares of
Company Common Stock, whose shares were converted into the right to receive
shares of Parent Common Stock (and cash in lieu of fractional shares) pursuant
to Section 1.6, (i) a letter of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery
shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass,
only upon receipt of the Certificates by the Exchange Agent, and shall be in
such form and have such other provisions as Parent may reasonably specify) and
(ii) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates in
exchange for certificates (or book entries in the case of shares that are
subject to vesting and/or repurchase rights in favor of Company) representing
shares of Parent Common Stock (and cash in lieu of fractional shares). Upon
surrender of a Certificate for cancellation to the Exchange Agent or to such
other agent or agents as may be appointed by Parent, together with such letter
of transmittal, duly completed and validly executed in accordance with the
instructions thereto, the holder of such Certificate shall be sent in exchange
therefor a certificate (or book entry

                                      A1-3

in the case of shares that are subject to vesting and/or repurchase rights)
representing the number of whole shares of Parent Common Stock and payment in
lieu of fractional shares which such holder has the right to receive pursuant
to Section 1.6, and the Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be canceled.
Until so surrendered, each outstanding Certificate that, prior to the Effective
Time, represented shares of Company Common Stock will be deemed from and after
the Effective Time to represent only the right to receive upon surrender of
such Certificate the merger consideration contemplated by Section 1.6.
Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, no interest will be paid
or will accrue on any cash payable to holders of Certificates pursuant to the
provisions of this Article I.

   (d) Distributions With Respect to Unexchanged Shares. No dividends or other
distributions with respect to Parent Common Stock with a record date after the
Effective Time will be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered Certificate with
respect to the shares of Parent Common Stock represented thereby until the
holder of record of such Certificate shall surrender such Certificate. Subject
to applicable law, following surrender of any such Certificate, there shall be
paid to the record holder of the certificates representing whole shares of
Parent Common Stock issued in exchange therefor, without interest, at the time
of such surrender, the amount of any such dividends or other distributions with
a record date after the Effective Time theretofore payable (but for the
provisions of this Section 1.7(d)) with respect to such shares of Parent Common
Stock.

   (e) Transfers of Ownership. If any certificate for shares of Parent Common
Stock is to be issued in a name other than that in which the Certificate
surrendered in exchange therefor is registered, it will be a condition of the
issuance thereof that the Certificate so surrendered will be properly endorsed
and otherwise in proper form for transfer and that the person requesting such
exchange will have paid to Parent or any agent designated by it any transfer or
other taxes required by reason of the issuance of a certificate for shares of
Parent Common Stock in any name other than that of the registered holder of the
Certificate surrendered, or established to the satisfaction of Parent or any
agent designated by it that such tax has been paid or is not payable.

   (f) No Liability. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section
1.7, none of the Exchange Agent, the Surviving Corporation, Parent or any party
hereto shall be liable to any person for any amount properly paid to a public
official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar law.

   1.8 Termination of Exchange Agent Funding. Any portion of funds (including
any interest earned thereon) or certificates for shares of Parent Common Stock
held by the Exchange Agent which have not been delivered to holders of
Certificates pursuant to this Article I within six months after the Effective
Time shall promptly be paid or delivered, as appropriate, to Parent, and
thereafter holders of Certificates who have not theretofore complied with the
exchange procedures set forth in and contemplated by Section 1.7 shall
thereafter look only to Parent (subject to abandoned property, escheat and
similar laws) for their claim for shares of Parent Common Stock and, only as
general creditors thereof, any cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent
Common Stock and any dividends or distributions (with a record date after the
Effective Time) with respect to Parent Common Stock to which they are entitled.

   1.9 No Further Ownership Rights in Company Common Stock. All shares of
Parent Common Stock issued upon the surrender for exchange of shares of Company
Common Stock in accordance with the terms hereof (including any cash paid in
lieu of fractional shares) shall be deemed to have been issued in full
satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such shares of Company Common Stock,
and there shall be no further registration of transfers on the records of the
Surviving Corporation of shares of Company Common Stock which were outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time,
Certificates are presented to the Surviving Corporation for any reason, they
shall be canceled and exchanged as provided in this Article I.

   1.10 Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates. In the event any Certificates
shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, the Exchange Agent shall issue in
exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificates, upon the making of an
affidavit of that fact by the holder thereof, such shares of Parent Common
Stock (and cash in lieu

                                      A1-4

of fractional shares) as may be required pursuant to Section 1.6; provided,
however, that Parent may, in its discretion and as a condition precedent to the
issuance thereof, require the owner of such lost, stolen or destroyed
Certificates to deliver a bond in such sum as it may reasonably direct as
indemnity against any claim that may be made against Parent, the Surviving
Corporation or the Exchange Agent with respect to the Certificates alleged to
have been lost, stolen or destroyed.

   1.11 Tax and Accounting Consequences. It is intended by the parties hereto
that the Merger shall (a) constitute a reorganization within the meaning of
Section 368(a) of the Code and (b) qualify for accounting treatment as a
pooling of interests.

   1.12 Withholding Rights. Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall be
entitled to deduct and withhold from the number of shares of Parent Common
Stock otherwise deliverable under this Agreement, and from any other payments
made pursuant to this Agreement, such amounts as Parent and the Surviving
Corporation are required to deduct and withhold with respect to such delivery
and payment under the Code or any provision of federal, national, state, local,
provincial or foreign tax law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld, such
withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having
been delivered and paid to the holder of shares of Company Common Stock in
respect of which such deduction and withholding was made by Parent and the
Surviving Corporation.

   1.13 Taking of Necessary Action; Further Action. If, at any time after the
Effective Time, any further action is necessary or desirable to carry out the
purposes of this Agreement and to vest the Surviving Corporation with full
right, title and possession to all assets, property, rights, privileges, powers
and franchises of Company and Merger Sub, the officers and directors of Company
and Merger Sub are fully authorized in the name of their respective
corporations or otherwise to take, and will take, all such lawful and necessary
action, so long as such action is not inconsistent with this Agreement.

                                   ARTICLE II

                   REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF COMPANY

   In this Agreement, any reference to any event, matter, change, condition,
circumstance or effect being "material" with respect to any person means any
material event, matter, change, condition, circumstance or effect related to
the condition and prospects (financial or otherwise), properties, assets
(including intangible assets), liabilities, business, operations or results of
operations of such person and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole. In this
Agreement, any reference to a "Material Adverse Effect" with respect to any
person means any event, matter, change, condition, circumstance or effect that
is materially adverse to the condition or prospects (financial or otherwise),
properties, assets (including intangible assets), liabilities, business,
operations or results of operations of such person and its subsidiaries, taken
as a whole, provided, however, that a "Material Adverse Effect" shall not
include: (a) a decrease, in and of itself, in the trading price or volume of
Company Common Stock or Parent Common Stock; or (b) general changes in the
automatic test equipment or integrated circuit validation systems markets or
general changes in economic conditions that affect such person or its
subsidiaries, taken as a whole; or (c) to the extent occurring after the date
of this Agreement with respect to Parent or Company or any of their respective
subsidiaries, the loss of customers or suppliers, or loss or reduction of
orders or shipments from customers or suppliers, to the extent that such losses
or reductions are primarily attributable to the announcement or pendency of the
Merger.

   In this Agreement, any reference to a party's "knowledge" means such party's
actual knowledge after reasonable inquiry of officers, directors and other
employees of such party charged with senior administrative or operational
responsibility for such matters.

   As used in this Agreement, the words "subsidiary" or "subsidiaries" means,
with respect to any person, any corporation or other organization, whether
incorporated or unincorporated, of which (i) such person or any other
subsidiary of such person is a general partner (excluding partnerships, the
general partnership interests of

                                      A1-5

which held by such person or any subsidiary of such person do not have a
majority of the voting interest in such partnership) or (ii) at least a
majority of the securities or other interests having by their terms ordinary
voting power to elect a majority of the board of directors, or others
performing similar functions with respect to such corporation or other
organization, is directly or indirectly owned or controlled by such person or
by one or more of its subsidiaries.

   Except as expressly disclosed in that section of the document of even date
herewith delivered by Company to Parent prior to the execution and delivery of
this Agreement (the "Company Disclosure Schedule") corresponding to the Section
of this Agreement to which any of the following representations and warranties
specifically relate, Company represents and warrants to Parent and Merger Sub
as follows:

   2.1 Organization, Standing and Power. Each of Company and its subsidiaries
is a corporation duly organized and validly existing under the laws of its
jurisdiction of organization. Each of Company and its subsidiaries has the
corporate power to own its properties and to carry on its business as now being
conducted and as presently proposed to be conducted and is duly qualified to do
business and is in good standing in each jurisdiction in which the failure to
be so qualified and in good standing could reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect on Company. Company has delivered to Parent a true and
correct copy of the Restated Articles of Incorporation (the "Articles of
Incorporation"), and Second Restated Bylaws or other charter documents, as
applicable, of Company and each of its subsidiaries, each as amended to date.
Neither Company nor any of its subsidiaries is in violation of any of the
provisions of its respective charter or bylaws or equivalent organizational
documents. Company is the owner of all outstanding shares of capital stock of
each of its subsidiaries and all such shares are duly authorized, validly
issued, fully paid and nonassessable. All of the outstanding shares of capital
stock of each such subsidiary are owned by Company free and clear of all liens,
charges, claims or encumbrances or rights of others. There are no outstanding
subscriptions, options, warrants, puts, calls, rights, exchangeable or
convertible securities or other commitments or agreements of any character
relating to the issued or unissued capital stock or other securities of any
such subsidiary, or otherwise obligating Company or any such subsidiary to
issue, transfer, sell, purchase, redeem or otherwise acquire any such
securities. Company does not directly or indirectly own any equity or similar
interest in, or any interest convertible or exchangeable or exercisable for,
any equity or similar interest in, any corporation, partnership, limited
liability company, joint venture or other business association or entity
(excluding securities in publicly traded companies held for passive investment
and comprising less than 1% of the outstanding stock of such company).

   2.2 Capital Structure. The authorized capital stock of Company consists of
15,000,000 shares of Common stock, $0.01 par value, of which there were issued
and outstanding as of the close of business on May 15, 2001, 7,889,987 shares,
and 10,000,000 shares of Preferred Stock $0.01 par value of which 150,000
shares have been designated as Series A Participating Preferred Stock. As of
the date of this Agreement there were no shares of Preferred Stock issued and
outstanding. No shares of Company Common Stock are held in treasury of Company
or by its subsidiaries. There are no other outstanding shares of capital stock
or voting securities and no outstanding commitments to issue any shares of
capital stock or voting securities, except pursuant to the exercise of options
outstanding as of such date under the Company Stock Option Plans or pursuant to
the Company's 1995 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the "Company ESPP"). All
outstanding shares of Company Common Stock are duly authorized, validly issued,
fully paid and non-assessable and are free of any liens or encumbrances, other
than any liens or encumbrances created by or imposed upon the holders thereof,
and are not subject to preemptive rights or rights of first refusal created by
statute, the Articles of Incorporation or Bylaws of Company or any agreement to
which Company is a party or by which it is bound. Company has reserved (i)
3,537,000 shares of Common Stock for issuance to employees, consultants and
directors pursuant to the Company Stock Option Plans, of which , as of the date
of this Agreement, 558,160 shares have been issued pursuant to option exercises
or direct stock purchases, 2,397,305 shares are subject to outstanding,
unexercised options, none are subject to outstanding stock purchase rights, and
581,535 shares are available for issuance thereunder and (ii) 450,000 shares of
Common Stock for issuance to employees pursuant to the Company ESPP, of which,
as of the date of this Agreement, 207,732 shares have been issued. Between May
15, 2001 and the date hereof, Company has not (i) issued or granted additional

                                      A1-6

options under the Company Stock Option Plans, or (ii) accepted enrollments in
the Company ESPP. Except for (i) the rights created pursuant to this Agreement,
the Company Stock Option Plans and the Company ESPP and (ii) Company's rights
to repurchase any unvested shares under the Company Stock Option Plans, there
are no other options, warrants, calls, rights, commitments or agreements of any
character to which Company is a party or by which it is bound obligating
Company to issue, deliver, sell, repurchase or redeem, or cause to be issued,
delivered, sold, repurchased or redeemed, any shares of capital stock of
Company or obligating Company to grant, extend, accelerate the vesting of,
change the price of, or otherwise amend or enter into any such option, warrant,
call, right, commitment or agreement. There are no contracts, commitments or
agreements relating to voting, purchase or sale of Company's capital stock
(other than those granting Company the right to purchase unvested shares upon
employment or service termination, and the Shareholder Agreement) (i) between
or among Company and any of its shareholders and (ii) to the best of Company's
knowledge, between or among any of Company's shareholders. The terms of the
Company Stock Option Plans permit the assumption of options to purchase Parent
Common Stock as provided in this Agreement, without the consent or approval of
the holders of such securities, shareholders, or otherwise. The current
"Offering Period" (as defined in the Company ESPP) commenced under the Company
ESPP on February 1, 2000 and will end on the date provided for in Section
5.9(c), and except for the purchase rights granted on such commencement date to
participants in the current Offering Period, there are no other purchase rights
or options outstanding under the Company ESPP. The terms of the Company ESPP
permit the Company to shorten and terminate Offering Periods without the
consent or approval of participants in the ESPP, shareholders, or otherwise.
True and complete copies of all agreements and instruments relating to or
issued under the Company Stock Option Plans or Company ESPP (or form, in the
case of instruments in standard form) have been made available to Parent and
such agreements and instruments have not been amended, modified or supplemented
since being made available to Parent, and there are no agreements to amend,
modify or supplement such agreements or instruments in any case from the form
made available to Parent. The shares of Company Common Stock issued under the
Company Stock Option Plans, as amended and under all prior versions thereof,
have either been registered under the Securities Act or were issued in
transactions which qualified for exemptions pursuant to Rule 701 under the
Securities Act for stock issuances under compensatory benefit plans.

   2.3 Authority. Company has all requisite corporate power and authority to

subsidiaries, or, to the knowledge of Company and its subsidiaries, any of
their respective directors or officers (in their capacities as such), that

requisite period for application has not expired. Company has also furnished
Parent with the most recent Internal Revenue Service determination letter
issued with respect to each such Company Employee Plan, and nothing has
occurred since the issuance of each such letter which would reasonably be

Plan subject to Code Section 401(a). Company has also furnished to Parent all
registration statements and prospectuses prepared in connection with each
Company Employee Plan.

   (c) (i) None of the Company Employee Plans promises or provides retiree

applicable law; (ii) there has been no "prohibited transaction," as such term
is defined in Section 406 of ERISA and Section 4975 of the Code, with respect
to any Company Employee Plan, which would reasonably be expected to have, in

regulations (including ERISA and the Code), except as would not have, in the
aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on Company, and Company and each

obligations required to be performed by them under, are not in default in any
material respect under or violation of, and have no knowledge of any material

material liability or material penalty under Sections 4976 through 4980 of the
Code or Title I of ERISA with respect to any of the Company Employee Plans; (v)

Company Employee Plan, no "reportable event" within the meaning of Section 4043
of ERISA (excluding any such event for which the thirty (30) day notice
requirement has been waived under the regulations to Section 4043 of ERISA) nor
any event described in Section 4062, 4063 or 4041 or ERISA has occurred; (vii)
no Company Employee Plan is covered by, and neither Company nor any subsidiary
or ERISA Affiliate has incurred or expects to incur any liability under Title
IV of ERISA or Section 412 of the Code; and (viii) each Company Employee Plan
can be amended, terminated or otherwise discontinued after the Effective Time
in accordance with its terms, without liability to Parent (other than for
benefits accrued through

                                     A1-13

the date of termination and ordinary administrative expenses typically incurred
in a termination event). With respect to each Company Employee Plan subject to
ERISA as either an employee pension plan within the meaning of Section 3(2) of
ERISA or an employee welfare benefit plan within the meaning of Section 3(1) of
ERISA, Company has prepared in good faith and timely filed all requisite
governmental reports (which were true and correct as of the date filed) and has
properly and timely filed and distributed or posted all notices and reports to
employees required to be filed, distributed or posted with respect to each such
Company Employee Plan, except where the failure to do so would not have a
Material Adverse Effect. No suit, administrative proceeding, action or other
litigation has been brought, or to the knowledge of Company is threatened,
against or with respect to any such Company Employee Plan, including any audit
or inquiry by the IRS or United States Department of Labor. No payment or
benefit which will or may be made by Company to any employee will be
characterized as an "excess parachute payment" within the meaning of Section
280G(b)(1) of the Code.

   (d) With respect to each Company Employee Plan, Company and each of its
United States subsidiaries have complied except to the extent that such failure

Effect on Company, with (i) the applicable health care continuation and notice
provisions of the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985
("COBRA") and the regulations (including proposed regulations) thereunder, (ii)
the applicable requirements of the Family Medical and Leave Act of 1993 and the
regulations thereunder, and (iii) the applicable requirements of the Health
Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 and the regulations
(including proposed regulations) thereunder.

   (e) The consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement will
not (i) entitle any current or former employee or other service provider of
Company, any Company subsidiary or any other ERISA Affiliate to severance
benefits or any other payment, except as expressly provided in this Agreement,
or (ii) accelerate the time of payment or vesting, or increase the amount of
compensation due any such employee or service provider.

   (f) There has been no amendment to, written interpretation or announcement
(whether or not written) by Company, any Company subsidiary or other ERISA
Affiliate relating to, or change in participation or coverage under, any
Company Employee Plan which would materially increase the expense of
maintaining such Plan above the level of expense incurred with respect to that
Plan for the most recent fiscal quarter included in Company's financial
statements.

   (g) Company does not currently maintain, sponsor, participate in or
