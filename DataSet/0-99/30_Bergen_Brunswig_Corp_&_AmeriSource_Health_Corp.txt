                 A MERGER PROPOSAL--YOUR VOTE IS VERY IMPORTANT

To the shareholders of AmeriSource Health Corporation and Bergen Brunswig
Corporation:

         AmeriSource and Bergen have agreed to combine in a merger of equals.
The new corporation is named AmeriSource-Bergen Corporation. We are proposing
the merger because we believe the combined strengths of our two companies will
enable us to achieve significant operating efficiencies and produce substantial
benefits for customers and shareholders of both companies. We ask for your
support in voting for the merger proposals at our respective special meetings.

         When the merger is completed:

         -        AmeriSource common shareholders will receive one share of
                  AmeriSource-Bergen common stock for each share of AmeriSource
                  they own; and

         -        Bergen common shareholders will receive 0.37 of a share of
                  AmeriSource-Bergen common stock for each share of Bergen they
                  own.

         AmeriSource-Bergen intends to apply to list its common stock on the New
York Stock Exchange under the symbol "ABC."

         The board of directors of each of AmeriSource and Bergen has
unanimously approved the merger and recommends that their shareholders vote FOR
the merger proposals as described in the attached materials. Information about
the merger is contained in this joint proxy statement-prospectus. WE URGE YOU TO
READ THIS MATERIAL, INCLUDING THE SECTION DESCRIBING RISK FACTORS RELATING TO
THE MERGER THAT BEGINS ON PAGE 27.

         The board of directors of each of AmeriSource and Bergen is convening a
special meeting of its shareholders in order to vote on the merger proposal. The
dates, times and places of the meetings are as follows:

For AmeriSource shareholders:                          For Bergen shareholders:
[                           ]                          [                      ]

         YOUR VOTE IS VERY IMPORTANT, REGARDLESS OF THE NUMBER OF SHARES YOU
OWN. Please vote as soon as possible to make sure that your shares are
represented at the meeting. To vote your shares, you may be able to submit your
proxy or voting instructions by telephone (and receive immediate acknowledgement
of the casting of your vote) or you may complete and return the enclosed proxy

boards of directors in enthusiastically recommending that you vote in favor of
the merger.

                     QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS ABOUT THE MERGER

Q:       WHY ARE AMERISOURCE AND BERGEN PROPOSING THE MERGER?

A:       We are proposing the merger because we believe the combined strengths
         of our two companies will enable us to achieve significant operating
         efficiencies and produce substantial benefits for our customers and
         shareholders. By combining the companies, AmeriSource-Bergen will
         create the potential for stronger operating results and a stronger
         financial condition than either company could achieve on its own.

Q:       WHAT WILL I RECEIVE IN THE MERGER?

A:       Shareholders of AmeriSource and Bergen will receive the following in
         the merger:

         -        AmeriSource common shareholders will receive one share of
                  AmeriSource-Bergen common stock for each share of AmeriSource
                  common stock they own; and

         -        Bergen common shareholders will receive 0.37 of a share of
                  AmeriSource-Bergen common stock for each share of Bergen
                  common stock they own.

Q:       WHAT PERCENT OF AMERISOURCE-BERGEN WILL BE OWNED BY CURRENT AMERISOURCE
         SHAREHOLDERS AND CURRENT BERGEN SHAREHOLDERS?

         will own approximately 51% of AmeriSource-Bergen and current Bergen
         shareholders will own approximately 49% of AmeriSource-Bergen.

Q:       WHERE WILL MY SHARES OF AMERISOURCE-BERGEN COMMON STOCK BE LISTED?

         outstanding as of the record date is required to approve and adopt the
         merger agreement. Each holder of Class A common stock is entitled to
         one vote per share.

         For Bergen, the affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast at the
         special meeting by holders of the outstanding shares of Bergen's common
         stock, assuming a quorum is present in person or by proxy, is required
         to approve and adopt the merger agreement.

         Bergen currently intend to vote their shares in favor of the approval
         and adoption of the merger agreement.

Q:       WHAT DO I NEED TO DO NOW?

A:       After you have carefully read and considered the information contained
         in this joint proxy statement-prospectus, please respond by submitting

         immediate acknowledgement of the casting of your vote or by completing,

Q:       WHAT IF I DON'T VOTE?

A:       If you are an AmeriSource shareholder and you:

         -        fail to respond, your shares will not be counted for purposes
                  of establishing a quorum and your failure to respond will have
                  the same effect as a vote against the approval and adoption of
                  the merger agreement;

         -        respond and either abstain from voting or have your shares
                  held by a brokerage firm or a bank and you do not indicate how
                  you want to vote, your shares will be counted for purposes of
                  establishing a quorum and your abstention or non-vote will
                  have the same effect as a vote against the approval and
                  adoption of the merger agreement; or

         -        respond and are a registered holder and do not indicate how
                  you want to vote, your shares will be voted FOR the approval
                  and adoption of the merger agreement.

         If you are a Bergen shareholder and you:

         -        fail to respond, your shares will not be counted for purposes
                  of establishing a quorum or for purposes of determining the
                  number of votes cast in connection with the proposal to
                  approve and adopt the merger agreement;

         -        respond and either abstain from voting or have your shares
                  held by a brokerage firm or a bank and you do not indicate how
                  you want to vote, your shares will be counted for purposes of
                  establishing a quorum and your abstention or non-vote will
                  have no effect on the approval and adoption of the merger
                  agreement; or

         -        respond and are a registered holder and do not indicate how
                  you want to vote, your shares will be voted FOR the approval
                  and adoption of the merger agreement.

Q:       HOW DO I VOTE MY SHARES IF MY SHARES ARE HELD IN "STREET NAME"?

A:       If your shares are held at an account at a brokerage firm or bank, a
         set of voting instructions should have accompanied this joint proxy
         statement-prospectus which should provide instructions on how to vote
         your shares. If you have not received such voting instructions or
         require further information regarding the voting instructions you
         received, you should contact your brokerage firm or bank and it can
         give you instructions on how to vote your shares. Your brokerage firm
         or bank cannot vote your shares unless it receives appropriate
         instructions from you.

Q:       CAN I CHANGE MY VOTE AFTER I HAVE DELIVERED MY PROXY?

A:       Yes. You can change your vote at any time before your proxy is voted at
         the special meeting. You can do this in one of three ways. First, you
         can revoke your proxy. Second, you can submit a new proxy. If you
         choose either of these two methods, you must submit your notice of
         revocation or your new proxy to the Secretary of AmeriSource or Bergen,
         as appropriate, before the special meeting. Third, you can attend the
         special meeting and vote in person and, if you are a Bergen
         shareholder, you must also submit a written notice of revocation with
         the Secretary of the meeting prior to the vote. If you submit your
         proxy or voting

         instructions by telephone, you can change your vote by submitting a
         proxy at a later date, using the same procedures, in which case your
         later submitted proxy will be recorded and your earlier proxy will be
         revoked. If your shares are held in an account at a brokerage firm or
         bank, you should contact your brokerage firm or bank to change your
         vote.

Q:       SHOULD I SEND IN MY STOCK CERTIFICATES NOW?

A:       No. After the merger is completed, you will receive written
         instructions from the exchange agent on how to exchange your stock
         certificates for shares of AmeriSource-Bergen. Please DO NOT send in
         your stock certificates with your proxy.

Q:       WHO IS THE EXCHANGE AGENT FOR THE MERGER?

A:       Mellon Investor Services LLC is the exchange agent.

Q:       WILL I HAVE TO PAY ANY U.S. TAX IN CONNECTION WITH THE MERGER?

A:       Neither AmeriSource shareholders nor Bergen shareholders will recognize
         any gain or loss for U.S. federal income tax purposes on the exchange
         of their AmeriSource or Bergen common stock for AmeriSource-Bergen
         common stock in the merger except for taxes payable because of the
         reimbursement of conveyance taxes or conveyance fees, and in the case
         of Bergen shareholders, because of cash received instead of fractional
         shares.

Q:       WILL I RECEIVE DIVIDENDS ON MY AMERISOURCE-BERGEN SHARES?

A:       AmeriSource-Bergen currently intends to pay quarterly cash dividends on
         its common stock of $0.025 per share.

Q:       AM I ENTITLED TO EXERCISE ANY DISSENTERS' OR APPRAISAL RIGHTS IN
         CONNECTION WITH THE MERGER?

A:       Neither AmeriSource shareholders nor Bergen shareholders are entitled
         to dissenters' or appraisal rights.

Q:       HOW DO THE RIGHTS OF AMERISOURCE SHAREHOLDERS COMPARE TO THOSE OF
         BERGEN SHAREHOLDERS, AND HOW DO THE RIGHTS OF AMERISOURCE OR BERGEN
         SHAREHOLDERS COMPARE TO THOSE RIGHTS THEY WILL HAVE AS SHAREHOLDERS OF
         AMERISOURCE-BERGEN?

A:       The rights of AmeriSource shareholders are governed by Delaware law and
         by AmeriSource's restated certificate of incorporation and restated
         bylaws, while the rights of Bergen shareholders are governed by New
         Jersey law, Bergen's restated certificate of incorporation, as amended,
         and Bergen's amended and restated bylaws. The rights of
         AmeriSource-Bergen shareholders will be governed by Delaware law and
         AmeriSource-Bergen's amended and restated certificate of incorporation
         and amended and restated bylaws. For a summary of significant
         differences between the rights of AmeriSource-Bergen shareholders,
         AmeriSource shareholders and Bergen shareholders, see "Comparison of
         Rights of AmeriSource-Bergen Shareholders, AmeriSource Shareholders and
         Bergen Shareholders" beginning on page 89.

Q:       WHO WILL BE THE DIRECTORS OF AMERISOURCE-BERGEN?

A:       The board of directors of AmeriSource-Bergen, and all committees of the
         board, will be comprised of an equal number of directors initially
         designated by each of AmeriSource and Bergen. AmeriSource and Bergen
         intend that, prior to or as soon as possible after the merger, the
         board of directors of AmeriSource-Bergen will be expanded to include
         two additional directors not previously affiliated with either
         AmeriSource or Bergen.

Q:       WHEN DO YOU EXPECT THE MERGER TO BE COMPLETED?

A:       We are working to complete the merger as quickly as possible. In
         addition to shareholder approvals, we must obtain regulatory approvals
         and satisfy other conditions set forth in the merger agreement.
         Assuming timely receipt of these approvals, we hope to complete the
         merger during the third quarter of calendar year 2001.

Q:       WHO CAN HELP ANSWER MY QUESTIONS?

A:       If you have any questions about the merger or how to submit your proxy,
         or if you need additional copies of this joint proxy
         statement-prospectus or the enclosed proxy card or voting instructions,

                  corporation. In the AmeriSource merger, AmeriSource
                  shareholders will receive one AmeriSource-Bergen share for
                  each AmeriSource share; and

         -        B-Sub Acquisition Corp. will be merged with and into Bergen,
                  and Bergen will be the surviving corporation. In the Bergen
                  merger, Bergen shareholders will receive 0.37 of an
                  AmeriSource-Bergen share for each Bergen share.

As a result, AmeriSource and Bergen will each become a wholly-owned subsidiary
of AmeriSource-Bergen and the shareholders of AmeriSource and Bergen will become
shareholders of AmeriSource-Bergen.

                           [AFTER THE MERGER GRAPHIC]

         In the event that either outside legal counsel of AmeriSource or
outside legal counsel of Bergen is unable to render an opinion that neither
AmeriSource or Bergen, as the case may be, nor the AmeriSource shareholders or
Bergen shareholders, as the case may be, will recognize any gain or loss for
federal income tax purposes in connection with the merger, except for taxes
payable because of the reimbursement of conveyance taxes or conveyance fees, and
in the case of Bergen shareholders, because of cash received instead of
fractional shares, we may amend the merger agreement to provide for the
simultaneous merger of AmeriSource and Bergen with and into AmeriSource-Bergen,
with AmeriSource-Bergen as the surviving corporation in each merger.

RECOMMENDATION OF THE BOARDS OF DIRECTORS AND OPINIONS OF FINANCIAL ADVISORS
(SEE PAGES 40 AND 46)

         To AmeriSource Shareholders: The AmeriSource board of directors
believes that the merger is fair to you and in your best interest and
unanimously voted to approve the merger agreement and unanimously recommends
that you vote FOR the approval and adoption of the merger agreement.

         To Bergen Shareholders: The Bergen board of directors believes that the
merger is fair to you and in your best interest and unanimously voted to approve
the merger agreement and unanimously recommends that you vote FOR the approval
and adoption of the merger agreement.

         Opinion of AmeriSource's Financial Advisor. In deciding to approve the
merger, the AmeriSource board of directors considered the opinion of its
financial advisor, Goldman, Sachs & Co., that, as of the date of its opinion,
and subject to and based on the considerations referred to in its opinion, the
ratio to exchange shares of AmeriSource common stock for shares of
AmeriSource-Bergen common stock was fair from a financial point of view to
holders of AmeriSource common stock. The full text of the written opinion of
Goldman Sachs, which sets forth assumptions made, matters considered and
limitation on the review undertaken in connection with the opinion, is attached
as Annex H to this joint proxy statement-prospectus. AmeriSource urges its
shareholders to read the opinion of Goldman Sachs in its entirety.

         Opinion of Bergen's Financial Advisor. In deciding to approve the
merger, the Bergen board of directors considered the opinion of its financial
advisor, Merrill Lynch & Co., that, as of the date of its opinion, and based
upon and subject to the factors and assumptions set forth in its opinion, the
ratio to exchange shares of Bergen common stock for AmeriSource-Bergen common
stock was fair from a financial point of view to the holders of Bergen common
stock. The full text of the written opinion of Merrill Lynch which sets forth
assumptions made, matters considered and qualifications and limitations on the
review undertaken in connection with the opinion, is attached as Annex I to this
joint proxy statement-prospectus. Bergen urges its shareholders to read the
opinion of Merrill Lynch in its entirety.

SHAREHOLDER APPROVALS (SEE PAGE 31)

         Approval of AmeriSource's Shareholders. A majority of the outstanding
shares of AmeriSource Class A common stock must be represented either in person
or by proxy to constitute a quorum at the AmeriSource special meeting. The
affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the shares of AmeriSource Class
A common stock outstanding as of the record date is required to approve and
adopt the merger agreement. As of the record date, AmeriSource directors and
executive officers and their affiliates owned approximately [ ]% of the
outstanding shares of AmeriSource Class A common stock.

         Approval of Bergen's Shareholders. A majority of the outstanding shares
of Bergen common stock must be represented either in person or by proxy to
constitute a quorum at the Bergen special meeting. The affirmative vote of a
majority of the votes cast at the Bergen special meeting, assuming a quorum is
present, is required to approve and adopt the merger agreement. As of the record
date, Bergen directors and executive officers and their affiliates owned
approximately [ ]% of the outstanding shares.

         Procedures for Voting Your Shares. Your vote is very important,
regardless of the number of shares you own. Please vote as soon as possible to
make sure that your shares are represented at the appropriate meeting. Whether
or not you plan to attend your meeting, you are requested to submit your vote by
either calling the toll-free telephone number provided on the proxy card or
voting instructions (and receive immediate acknowledgement of the casting of
your vote) or completing, signing and dating the enclosed proxy card and
returning it in the prepaid envelope. If you are a holder of record, you may
vote in person at the appropriate special meeting. If you submit a properly
executed proxy card and do not include instructions on how to vote, your shares
will be voted FOR approval and adoption of the merger agreement. If you fail to
respond, your shares will not be counted for purposes of establishing a quorum
and, in the case of AmeriSource shareholders, it will have the same effect as
voting against the approval and adoption of the merger agreement.

         If your shares are held in an account at a brokerage firm or bank, your
brokerage firm or bank should have provided a set of voting instructions with
this joint proxy statement-prospectus which should provide instructions on how
to vote your shares. If you have not received such voting instructions or
require further information regarding such voting instructions, contact your
brokerage firm or bank and they can give you directions on how to vote your
shares. Your brokerage firm or bank cannot vote your shares unless they receive
appropriate instructions from you.

         Procedure for Changing Your Vote. You can change your vote at any time
before your proxy is voted at the special meeting of your company's
shareholders. You can do this in one of three ways. First, you can send a
written notice stating that you are revoking your proxy. Second, you can
complete and submit a new proxy card. If you choose either of these two methods,
you must submit your notice of revocation or your new proxy for AmeriSource
shares to the Secretary of AmeriSource at the address on page 13 and for Bergen
shares to the Secretary of Bergen at the address on page 13. Third, if you are a
holder of record, you can attend the special meeting of your company's
shareholders and vote in person and, if you are a Bergen shareholder, you must
give written notice of revocation to the Secretary of Bergen. To revoke a proxy
previously submitted by telephone, you may simply submit a proxy at a later
date, using the same procedures, in which case your later submitted proxy will
be recorded and your earlier proxy will be revoked. If your shares are held in
an account at a brokerage firm or bank, you should contact your broker or bank
to change your vote.

         Appraisal Rights. Under Delaware law, AmeriSource shareholders are not
entitled to appraisal rights in connection with the merger. Under New Jersey
law, Bergen shareholders are not entitled to appraisal rights in connection with
the merger.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS AND MANAGEMENT FOLLOWING THE MERGER (SEE PAGE 102)

         Upon completion of the merger, the board of directors of
AmeriSource-Bergen will be comprised of at least eight individuals, four of whom
will be former AmeriSource directors and four of whom will be former Bergen
directors. The members of the board of directors of AmeriSource-Bergen will
include:

         -        Robert E. Martini, the current Chairman and Chief Executive
                  Officer of Bergen,

         -        R. David Yost, the current Chairman and Chief Executive
                  Officer of AmeriSource,

         -        three of the independent directors of Bergen immediately prior
                  to the merger designated by Bergen, and

         -        three of the independent directors of AmeriSource immediately
                  prior to the merger designated by AmeriSource.

Robert E. Martini will be the Chairman of the board of directors of
AmeriSource-Bergen. AmeriSource and Bergen intend that, prior to or as soon as
possible after the merger, the board of directors of AmeriSource-Bergen will be
expanded to ten persons and two additional directors not previously affiliated
with either AmeriSource or Bergen will join the board of directors.

         The principal executive officers and members of the Executive
Management Committee of AmeriSource-Bergen upon completion of the merger will be
as follows:

         -        R. David Yost, President and Chief Executive Officer
                  (currently Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of
                  AmeriSource);

         -        Kurt J. Hilzinger, Executive Vice President and Chief
                  Operating Officer (currently President and Chief Operating
                  Officer of AmeriSource);

         -        Neil F. Dimick, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial
                  Officer (currently Senior Executive Vice President and Chief
                  Financial Officer of Bergen);

         -        Brent R. Martini, Senior Vice President of AmeriSource-Bergen
                  and the President of AmeriSource-Bergen Drug Company
                  (currently Senior Executive Vice President of Bergen and
                  President of Bergen Brunswig Drug Company);

         -        Charles J. Carpenter, Senior Vice President of
                  AmeriSource-Bergen and President of PharMerica, Inc.
                  (currently Senior Executive Vice President of Bergen and
                  President of Bergen's subsidiary PharMerica, Inc.); and

         -        Steven H. Collis, Senior Vice President of AmeriSource-Bergen
                  and President of ASD Specialty Healthcare, Inc. (currently
                  Senior Executive Vice President of Bergen and President of
                  Bergen's subsidiary ASD Specialty Healthcare, Inc.).

         The executive management committee shall have and shall exercise all of
the powers and authority in the management of the business and affairs of
AmeriSource-Bergen, insofar as it pertains to capital expenditures and
acquisitions, as the board of directors of AmeriSource-Bergen may determine.

INTERESTS OF DIRECTORS AND EXECUTIVE OFFICERS IN THE MERGER (SEE PAGES 51 AND
53)

         Some of the directors and executive officers of AmeriSource and Bergen
have interests in the merger that are different from, or are in addition to, the
interests of their company's shareholders. These interests include the potential
for positions as directors or executive officers of AmeriSource-Bergen,
potential benefits under employment or benefit arrangements as a result of the
merger, acceleration of vesting of options or lapse of restrictions on
restricted stock as a result of the merger, potential severance and other
benefits payments in the event of termination of employment in connection with
the merger, and the right to continued indemnification and insurance coverage by
AmeriSource-Bergen for acts or omissions occurring prior to the merger.

TREATMENT OF STOCK OPTIONS (SEE PAGE 57)

         AmeriSource. When the merger is completed, each outstanding AmeriSource
stock option will be converted into an option to purchase the number of shares
of AmeriSource-Bergen common stock equal to the number of shares of AmeriSource
common stock issuable upon the exercise of the AmeriSource option at an exercise
price per share equal to the exercise price per share of AmeriSource common
stock subject to the option before the conversion.

         The board of directors of AmeriSource will cause each outstanding
AmeriSource stock option granted prior to February 15, 2001 to vest as of the
close of business on the last business day prior to the merger, and to become
exercisable upon the earlier to occur of its normal vesting date and the first
anniversary of the completion of the merger.

         Bergen. When the merger is completed, each outstanding Bergen stock
option will be converted into an option to purchase the number of shares of
AmeriSource-Bergen common stock equal to the number of shares of Bergen common
stock issuable under the Bergen option multiplied by 0.37, at an exercise price
per share equal to the exercise price per share of Bergen common stock subject
to the option before the conversion divided by 0.37.

         The board of directors of Bergen will cause each outstanding Bergen
stock option granted prior to February 15, 2001 to vest as of the close of
business on the last business day prior to the merger, and to become exercisable
upon the earlier to occur of its normal vesting date and the first anniversary
of the completion of the merger.

TAX CONSEQUENCES (SEE PAGE 58)

         None of AmeriSource, Bergen or their respective shareholders who
exchange their shares for shares of AmeriSource-Bergen common stock will
recognize a gain or loss for United States federal income tax purposes in
connection with the merger, except for taxes payable because of the
reimbursement of conveyance taxes or conveyance fees, and in the case of Bergen
shareholders, because of cash received instead of fractional shares.

ACCOUNTING TREATMENT (SEE PAGE 61)

         We expect that the merger will be accounted for under the purchase
method of accounting for business combinations. Since current AmeriSource
shareholders will own approximately 51% of AmeriSource-Bergen's common stock
immediately after the merger (with current Bergen shareholders owning the
remaining approximately 49% of AmeriSource-Bergen common stock),
AmeriSource-Bergen will account for the merger as an acquisition by AmeriSource
of Bergen. The value of Bergen as indicated by the fair value of the stock of
AmeriSource-Bergen issued to acquire Bergen (i.e., the purchase price) over the
fair value of Bergen's net tangible and identifiable intangible assets, will be
treated as an intangible asset of AmeriSource-Bergen termed "goodwill" and,
under current accounting and financial reporting rules, will be amortized
against earnings over a period of time. The goodwill will be allocated to one or
more reporting units.

         Under new accounting and financial reporting rules proposed by the
Financial Accounting Standards Board in its exposure draft entitled Business
Combinations and Intangible Assets - Accounting for Goodwill, dated February 14,
2001, goodwill, including goodwill recognized in connection with the merger,
will no longer be amortized and charged against earnings but would instead be
subject to periodic testing for impairment and corresponding write-downs, if
necessary. The merger is conditioned upon the promulgation of these new
accounting and financial reporting rules.

OVERVIEW OF THE MERGER AGREEMENT (SEE PAGE 63)

         Conditions to the Completion of the Merger. Each of AmeriSource's and
Bergen's obligation to complete the merger is subject to the satisfaction or
waiver of specified conditions, including those listed below:

         -        the approval and adoption of the merger agreement by both the
                  holders of AmeriSource Class A common stock and Bergen common
                  stock;

         -        the applicable waiting period under U.S. antitrust laws must
                  expire or be earlier terminated;

         -        the absence of any action by any governmental authority
                  challenging the merger or seeking to limit the ownership or
                  operation of AmeriSource, Bergen or their subsidiaries before
                  or after the merger;

         -        the declaration of effectiveness of the registration statement
                  on Form S-4, of which this joint proxy statement-prospectus
                  forms a part, by the Securities and Exchange Commission, and
                  the absence of any stop order or threatened or pending
                  proceedings seeking a stop order;

         -        the shares of AmeriSource-Bergen common stock to be issued in
                  the merger must be approved for listing on the New York Stock
                  Exchange, subject to official notice of issuance;

         -        the promulgation by the Financial Accounting Standards Board
                  of a final Statement of Financial Accounting Standard which
                  provides for accounting treatment of the merger in all
                  material respects as in the Exposure Draft of the proposed
                  Statement entitled Business Combinations and Intangible Assets
                  - Accounting for Goodwill, dated February 14, 2001; and

         -        AmeriSource and Bergen must each receive an opinion of tax
                  counsel that neither it nor its shareholders will be subject
                  to U.S. federal income tax as a result of the merger, other
                  than due to the payment of cash in lieu of fractional shares
                  or to reimburse conveyance taxes.

         Termination of the Merger Agreement. AmeriSource and Bergen can jointly
agree to terminate the merger agreement at any time. Either company may also
terminate the merger agreement if:

         -        the merger is not completed on or before September 15, 2001;
                  however, this termination right is not available to any party
                  whose failure to perform any material covenant or obligation
                  under the merger agreement resulted in the failure to complete
                  the merger by that date;

         -        the approval of either party's shareholders is not obtained
                  because of the failure to obtain the required vote to approve
                  and adopt the merger agreement;

         -        the other party materially breaches any of its
                  representations, warranties, covenants or agreements in the
                  merger agreement, which breach would result in the failure to
                  satisfy a condition to the completion of the merger, and the
                  breach, if curable, is not cured within 30 days after notice
                  is received by the breaching party;

         -        the other party materially breaches any of its obligations
                  under its stock option agreement; or

         -        the other party adversely changes its board recommendation of
                  the merger agreement, recommends a competing transaction or
                  fails to recommend against a competing offer, each as
                  described beginning on page 65.

         Termination Fees and Expenses. The merger agreement provides that in
certain circumstances AmeriSource or Bergen may be required to pay a termination
fee of $75 million, as well as expenses not to exceed $15 million, to the other
party as described beginning on page 67.

         No Solicitation of Alternative Transactions. The merger agreement
contains detailed provisions prohibiting AmeriSource and Bergen from seeking an
alternative transaction to the merger. These "no solicitation" provisions
prohibit AmeriSource and Bergen, and prohibit AmeriSource and Bergen from
authorizing or permitting any of their subsidiaries and any of their directors,
officers, employees, agents and representatives, from taking any action to
solicit a proposal for a competing transaction, as described on page 65.
However, the merger agreement does not prohibit either party or its board of
directors from considering and potentially recommending a written proposal for a
competing transaction which was not solicited or encouraged after the date of
the merger agreement, as described on pages 65 and 66.

REGULATORY MATTERS (SEE PAGE 62)

         Under U.S. antitrust laws, AmeriSource and Bergen may not complete the
merger until required information and materials are furnished to the Antitrust
Division of the Department of Justice and the Federal Trade Commission and the
specified waiting periods are terminated or expire. AmeriSource and Bergen filed
the required information and materials with the Department of Justice and the
Federal Trade Commission on April 6, 2001. On May 7, 2001, the Federal Trade
Commission issued a request for additional information and, as a result, is
extending

the required waiting period under U.S. antitrust laws until 30 days after
AmeriSource and Bergen have substantially complied with such request. See "The
Merger-Regulatory Matters" which begins on page 62.

COMPLETION AND EFFECTIVENESS OF THE MERGER (SEE PAGE 55)

         The parties will complete the merger when all of the conditions to
completion of the merger are satisfied or waived in accordance with the merger
agreement. The merger will be completed when AmeriSource files a certificate of
merger with the Delaware Secretary of State and Bergen files a certificate of
merger with the New Jersey Department of the Treasury. However, AmeriSource and
Bergen may agree to a later time for completion of the merger and specify that
time in their respective certificates of merger. The parties expect to complete
the merger during the third quarter of calendar year 2001.

STOCK OPTION AGREEMENTS (SEE PAGE 73)

         Each of AmeriSource and Bergen has issued to the other an option to
purchase, under certain circumstances, up to approximately 19.9% of their
respective outstanding shares of common stock. An option becomes exercisable if
the grantee becomes entitled to receive the termination fee under the merger
agreement as described on page 73. The purchase price of the option issued by
AmeriSource to Bergen is $48.48 per AmeriSource share, and the purchase price of
the option issued by Bergen to AmeriSource is $17.9376 per Bergen share. The
stock option agreements limit the amount of profit that an option holder is
permitted to receive.

SUPPORT/VOTING AGREEMENTS (SEE PAGE 75)

         In connection with the merger agreement, AmeriSource has entered into
support/voting agreements with Robert E. Martini and Neil F. Dimick, both of
whom are executive officers and directors of Bergen. As of the record date,
Messrs. Martini and Dimick held approximately [ ] Bergen common shares,
representing [ ]% of the outstanding Bergen common shares. Pursuant to the
support/voting agreements, each of Messrs. Martini and Dimick has agreed, among
other things, to vote all of his shares held on the record date in favor of
adoption and approval of the merger agreement and the merger at the special
meeting.

         In connection with the merger agreement, Bergen has entered into
support/voting agreements with R. David Yost, who is an executive officer and
director of AmeriSource, and Kurt J. Hilzinger, who is an executive officer of
AmeriSource. As of the record date, Messrs. Yost and Hilzinger held
approximately [ ] AmeriSource Class A common shares, representing [ ]% of the
outstanding AmeriSource Class A common shares. Pursuant to the support/voting
agreements, each of Messrs. Yost and Hilzinger has agreed, among other things,
to vote all of his shares held on the record date in favor of the adoption and
approval of the merger agreement and the merger at the special meeting.

MARKET PRICE INFORMATION (SEE PAGE 79)

         Shares of each of AmeriSource Class A common stock and Bergen common
stock are traded on the New York Stock Exchange. AmeriSource has never paid
dividends. Bergen has paid cash dividends on its common stock totaling $0.170,
$0.225 and $0.315 per share in fiscal 2000, 1999 and 1998, respectively. The
following table sets forth comparative market price information as of March 16,
2001, the last trading day before the public announcement of the merger, and as
of [    ], 2001, the most recent date for which information was available at the

(a)    Amounts include the effect of AmeriSource's and Bergen's special items as
       described in Note 5 of the Notes to Unaudited Pro Forma Consolidated
       Condensed Financial Statements. The aggregate effect of these items was:

       -      to reduce pro forma consolidated income from continuing operations
              by $55.3 million; and

       -      to reduce pro forma earnings per share from continuing operations
              -- assuming dilution by $.54.

(b)    Pro forma consolidated cash dividends declared per share represent the
       combined company's intention to declare and pay a quarterly dividend of
       $.025 per share.

                   UNAUDITED COMPARATIVE PER SHARE INFORMATION

         We have set forth below per share information regarding earnings, cash
dividends declared and book value of AmeriSource and Bergen on both historical
and unaudited pro forma consolidated bases and on a per share equivalent
unaudited pro forma basis for Bergen. We have derived the unaudited pro forma
consolidated earnings per share information from the "Unaudited Pro Forma
Consolidated Condensed Financial Information" presented elsewhere in this
document. Unaudited pro forma consolidated cash dividends declared per share
reflect the combined company's intention to declare and pay a quarterly dividend
of $.025 per share. Book value per share for the unaudited pro forma
consolidated presentation is based upon outstanding shares of AmeriSource and
Bergen common stock, adjusted to reflect the exchange of common stock in the
merger for shares of AmeriSource-Bergen common stock, at the time the merger is
completed. The per share equivalent unaudited pro forma consolidated data for
shares of Bergen common stock is based on the assumed conversion of each share
of Bergen common stock into 0.37 of a share of AmeriSource-Bergen common stock.
See "The Merger--Structure of the Merger and Conversion of AmeriSource and
Bergen Stock." You should read the information set forth below in conjunction
with the respective audited and unaudited financial statements of AmeriSource
and Bergen incorporated by reference in this document and the "Unaudited Pro
Forma Consolidated Condensed Financial Information" and the notes thereto
presented elsewhere in this document. See "Where You Can Find More Information."

                                  RISK FACTORS

         You should carefully consider the following risk factors in deciding
whether to vote for approval and adoption of the merger agreement. These factors
are important, and we have not been able to quantify their potential effects on
the combined company. These factors are in addition to the risks faced by
AmeriSource and Bergen in their day-to-day operations and are not presented in
order of magnitude or importance. These factors are also in addition to the
other information contained in or incorporated by reference into this joint
proxy statement-prospectus.

THE VALUE OF THE SHARES OF AMERISOURCE-BERGEN STOCK THAT YOU RECEIVE MAY BE LESS
THAN THE VALUE OF YOUR SHARES OF AMERISOURCE COMMON STOCK OR BERGEN COMMON
STOCK.

         Upon completion of the merger, all shares of AmeriSource common stock
and Bergen common stock will be converted into shares of AmeriSource-Bergen
common stock. The exchange ratios on which the shares will be converted are
fixed, and there will be no adjustment for changes in the market price of either
AmeriSource common stock or Bergen common stock. As a result, shares of
AmeriSource common stock and shares of Bergen common stock may have a greater
market value than the shares of AmeriSource-Bergen common stock for which they
are exchanged. Neither party is permitted to "walk away" from the merger or
re-solicit the vote of its shareholders solely because of changes in the market
price of either party's common stock. Changes in the market price of the Bergen
or AmeriSource common stock may result from a variety of factors that are beyond
the control of AmeriSource or Bergen, including changes in their businesses,
operations and prospects, regulatory considerations, general market and economic
conditions, or other factors. The prices of the shares of AmeriSource common
stock and the shares of Bergen common stock at the time of the merger may vary
from their respective prices disclosed in the joint proxy statement-prospectus
and on the day of the special meetings.

         The special meetings will be held prior to the completion of the merger
and the shares of AmeriSource-Bergen common stock will not trade publicly until
the completion of the merger. As a result, at the time of the special meeting
you will not know the market value of the AmeriSource-Bergen common stock that
you will receive upon completion of the merger.

THE NEED FOR GOVERNMENTAL APPROVALS MAY AFFECT THE DATE OF CONSUMMATION OF THE
MERGER OR MAY DIMINISH THE BENEFITS OF THE MERGER.

         The merger is conditioned upon, among other things, the expiration or
termination of the applicable waiting period under the applicable United States
antitrust laws, including the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of
1976, as amended. Satisfying this condition to the merger may affect the date of
consummation of the merger. In addition, you should be aware that it is possible
that government agencies may seek to challenge the merger or limit
AmeriSource-Bergen's ownership or operation of AmeriSource, Bergen or their
subsidiaries after the merger or otherwise seek to restrict the combined
operations of AmeriSource and Bergen as a condition to approving the merger. In
1998, the Federal Trade Commission requested and received injunctions to prevent
previous mergers contemplated by AmeriSource and Bergen with other parties. Both
of the previous proposed mergers were terminated as a result of such
injunctions. Any challenges, limitations or restrictions imposed by government
agencies could prevent the merger or diminish the benefits of the merger to
AmeriSource-Bergen and shareholders of AmeriSource and Bergen who become
shareholders of AmeriSource-Bergen.

THE NEED FOR THE ADOPTION OF NEW ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL REPORTING RULES MAY
AFFECT THE DATE OF CONSUMMATION OF THE MERGER.

         The merger is conditioned upon, among other things, promulgation by the
Financial Accounting Standards Board of a final Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards providing for accounting treatment of the merger and the
other related transactions in all material respects as in the Exposure Draft of
the proposed Statement entitled Business Combinations and Intangible Assets -
Accounting for Goodwill, dated February 14, 2001. Satisfying this condition to
the merger may affect the date of consummation of the merger. In addition, it is
possible that the

Financial Accounting Standards Board may not promulgate a final Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards that provides for accounting treatment for the
merger in all material respects as in the Exposure Draft of the proposed
Statement, or that the Financial Accounting Standards Board may promulgate a
final Statement that provides for materially different treatment of goodwill,
including goodwill recognized in connection with the merger, from the accounting
treatment in the Exposure Draft of the proposed Statement. AmeriSource and
Bergen may waive satisfaction of this condition to the merger. However, if such
condition were to be waived, we expect that the amortization of goodwill
recorded in connection with the merger, under current accounting and financial
reporting rules, would materially diminish the future reported earnings, if any,
of AmeriSource-Bergen as compared to what is expected under the proposed rules.
There may also be a delay in the effective date of any new accounting and
financial reporting rules, which could materially diminish the future earnings,
if any, of AmeriSource-Bergen. As of May 16, 2001, the Financial Accounting
Standards Board has not publicly pronounced any changes or any intention to make
changes which would provide for accounting treatment for the non-amortization of
goodwill different from the Exposure Draft of the proposed Statement.

AMERISOURCE-BERGEN MAY NOT REALIZE ALL OF THE ANTICIPATED BENEFITS OF THE
MERGER.

         The success of the merger will depend in part on the ability of
AmeriSource-Bergen to realize the anticipated synergies of $125 million per year
by the end of the third year of the existence of AmeriSource-Bergen and growth
opportunities from integrating the businesses of AmeriSource and Bergen.
AmeriSource-Bergen's success in realizing these synergies, cost savings and
growth opportunities, and the timing of this realization, depends on the
successful integration of AmeriSource's and Bergen's operations. Even if
AmeriSource-Bergen is able to integrate the business operations of AmeriSource
and Bergen successfully, AmeriSource-Bergen cannot assure you that this
integration will result in the realization of the full benefits of the
synergies, cost savings and growth opportunities that AmeriSource-Bergen
currently expects to result from this integration or that these benefits will be
achieved within the anticipated time frame. For example, the elimination of
duplicative costs may not be possible or may take longer than anticipated and
the benefits from the merger may be offset by costs incurred in integrating the
companies.

DIRECTORS OF AMERISOURCE AND BERGEN HAVE POTENTIAL CONFLICTS OF INTEREST IN
RECOMMENDING THAT YOU VOTE IN FAVOR OF THE APPROVAL AND ADOPTION OF THE MERGER
AGREEMENT.

         A number of directors of AmeriSource and a number of directors of
Bergen who are recommending that you vote in favor of the approval and adoption
of the merger agreement may have employment or severance agreements or benefit
arrangements that provide them with interests in the merger that may differ from
yours. Following completion of the merger, Robert E. Martini, Chairman and Chief
Executive Officer of Bergen, will become the non-executive Chairman of the board
of directors of AmeriSource-Bergen. R. David Yost, Chairman and Chief Executive
Officer of AmeriSource, will become President and Chief Executive Officer of
AmeriSource-Bergen and a member of the AmeriSource-Bergen board of directors.
Neil F. Dimick, a director and Senior Executive Vice President and Chief
Financial Officer of Bergen, will become Executive Vice President and Chief
Financial Officer of AmeriSource-Bergen. Brent R. Martini, a director and Senior
Executive Vice President of Bergen and President of Bergen Brunswig Drug
Company, will become a Senior Vice President of AmeriSource-Bergen and the
President of AmeriSource-Bergen Drug Company.

         The expected receipt of compensation or other benefits in the merger,
including the vesting of stock options, the continuation of indemnification
arrangements for current directors of AmeriSource and Bergen following
completion of the merger, the payment of severance and other benefits, or, in
the case of Bergen, lapse of restrictions on restricted stock, may have
influenced these directors in making their recommendation that you vote in favor
of the approval and adoption of the merger agreement. See "The Merger-Interests
of Certain AmeriSource Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger" and "The
Merger-Interests of Certain Bergen Directors and Executive Officers in the
Merger" on pages 51 and 53.

PROXIES

         Your vote is very important regardless of the number of shares you own.
Please vote as soon as possible to make sure that your shares are represented at
the appropriate meeting. Whether or not you plan to attend your meeting, you
are requested to promptly submit your vote by either calling the toll-free
telephone number provided on the proxy card or voting instructions (and receive
immediate acknowledgement of the casting of your vote) or completing, signing
and dating the enclosed proxy card and returning it in the enclosed prepaid
envelope.

         All shares of AmeriSource Class A common stock represented by properly
executed proxies received before or at the AmeriSource special meeting and all
shares of Bergen common stock represented by properly executed proxies received
before or at the Bergen special meeting will, unless the proxies are revoked, be
voted in accordance with the instructions indicated on those proxies. If you are
a holder of record, you may vote in person at either of the applicable special
meetings. If you submit a properly executed proxy card and do not include
instructions on how to vote, your shares will be voted FOR the approval and
adoption of the merger agreement. You are urged to mark the box on the proxy
card to indicate how to vote your shares.

         If your shares are held in an account at a brokerage firm or bank, your
brokerage firm or bank should have provided a set of voting instructions with
this joint proxy statement-prospectus which should provide instructions on how
to vote your shares. If you have not received such voting instructions or
require further information regarding such voting instructions contact your
brokerage firm or bank and they can give you directions on how to vote your
shares. Your brokerage firm or bank cannot vote your shares unless they receive
appropriate instructions from you.

         If you fail to respond, your shares will not be counted for purposes of
establishing a quorum and, in the case of AmeriSource shareholders, will have
the same effect as a vote against the approval and adoption of the merger
agreement. If a properly executed proxy card or voting instruction is returned
and the shareholder has abstained from voting on the approval and adoption of
the merger agreement, the AmeriSource Class A common stock or Bergen common
stock represented by the proxy or voting instructions will be considered present
at the special meeting for purposes of determining a quorum, but, in the case of
AmeriSource, will have the same effect as a vote against the approval and
adoption of the merger agreement and, in the case of Bergen, will not be
considered to have been voted in favor of the approval and adoption of the
merger agreement. If an executed proxy card is returned by a broker or bank
holding shares which indicates that the broker or bank does not have
discretionary authority to vote on the approval and adoption of the merger
agreement, the shares will be considered present at the

meeting for purposes of determining a quorum, but, in the case of AmeriSource,
will have the same effect as a vote against the approval and adoption of the
merger agreement.

         In the case of AmeriSource shareholders, because the approval and
adoption of the merger agreement requires the affirmative vote of at least a
majority of the shares of AmeriSource's Class A common stock outstanding on the
record date, abstentions and broker or bank non-votes and failures to vote will
have the same effect as a vote against the approval and adoption of the merger
agreement.

         The AmeriSource special meeting or the Bergen special meeting may be
adjourned or postponed in order to permit further solicitation of proxies. No
proxy voted against the proposal to approve and adopt the merger agreement will
be voted in favor of any proposal to adjourn or postpone the special meeting
that is submitted to the shareholders for a vote.

         Neither AmeriSource nor Bergen expects that any matter other than
approval and adoption of the merger agreement will be brought before its special
meeting. If, however, other matters are properly presented, the persons named as
proxies will vote in accordance with their judgment with respect to those
matters, unless authority to do so is withheld on the proxy card.

         A shareholder may revoke his or her proxy at any time before it is
voted by:

         -        notifying in writing that you are revoking your proxy or
                  granting a subsequently dated proxy to the Secretary of
                  AmeriSource Health Corporation at 1300 Morris Drive, Suite
                  100, Chesterbrook, Pennsylvania 19087-5594, if you are an
                  AmeriSource shareholder, or the Secretary of Bergen Brunswig
                  Corporation at 4000 Metropolitan Drive, Orange, California
                  92868-3510, if you are a Bergen shareholder; or

         -        appearing in person (and in the case of Bergen shareholders,
                  filing written notice of revocation with the secretary of the
                  meeting) and voting at the special meeting if you are a holder
                  of record.

         Attendance at the special meeting will not in and of itself constitute
revocation of a proxy.

         If you submit your proxy by telephone, you can change your vote by
submitting a proxy at a later date using the same procedures.

         If your shares are held in an account at a brokerage firm or bank, you
should contact your brokerage firm or bank to change your vote.

VOTING BY TELEPHONE

         Because Delaware, the state in which AmeriSource is incorporated, and
New Jersey, the state in which Bergen is incorporated, permit submission of
proxies by telephone, instead of submitting your vote by mail on the enclosed
proxy card or voting instructions, all shareholders will have the option to
submit their proxies and many shareholders will have the option to submit their
voting instructions by telephone. Please note that there are separate
arrangements for using the telephone depending on whether your shares are
registered in your company's stock records in your name and therefore submit a
proxy or in the name of a brokerage firm or bank and therefore provide voting
instructions. Shareholders should check their proxy card or voting instructions
forwarded by their broker, bank or other holder of record to see which options
are available.

         The telephone procedures for submitting your proxy or voting
instructions are designed to authenticate shareholders' identities, to allow
shareholders to have their shares voted and to confirm that their instructions
have been properly recorded. We have been advised by counsel that the procedures
that have been put in place are consistent with the requirements of applicable
law.

SOLICITATION OF PROXIES

         AmeriSource and Bergen will share equally the expenses incurred in
connection with the printing and mailing of this joint proxy
statement-prospectus. Bergen has retained Morrow & Co., Inc. at an estimated
cost of $15,000 plus reimbursement of expenses, to assist in the solicitation of
proxies. AmeriSource, Bergen and Bergen's proxy solicitors will also request
banks, brokerage firms and other intermediaries holding shares of AmeriSource
Class A common stock or Bergen common stock beneficially owned by others, to
send this joint proxy statement-prospectus to, and obtain proxies from, the
beneficial owners and will reimburse the holders for their reasonable expenses
in so doing.

         Solicitation of proxies by mail may be supplemented by telephone,
telegram and other electronic means, advertisements and personal solicitation by
the directors, officers or employees of AmeriSource and Bergen. No additional
compensation will be paid to directors, officers or employees for such
solicitation.

         You should not send in any stock certificates with your proxy card. A
transmittal letter with instructions for the surrender of stock certificates
will be mailed to you as soon as practicable after completion of the merger.

                                   THE MERGER

         This section of this joint proxy statement-prospectus describes
material aspects of the proposed merger, including the merger agreement, the
stock option agreements, the support/voting agreements and the opinions of our
financial advisers. While we believe that the description covers the material
terms of the merger, this summary may not contain all of the information that is
important to you. You should read this entire joint proxy statement-prospectus
and the other documents we refer to carefully for a more complete understanding
of the merger. In addition, we incorporate important business and financial
information about each of us into this joint proxy statement-prospectus by
reference. You may obtain the information incorporated by reference into this
joint proxy statement-prospectus without charge by following the instructions in
the section entitled "Where You Can Find More Information" that begins on page
106 of this joint proxy statement-prospectus.

BACKGROUND OF THE MERGER

         Each of AmeriSource and Bergen have from time to time evaluated
potential acquisitions or combinations that would further the companies'
strategic objectives, including consolidation opportunities in the
pharmaceutical wholesaling industry and supplementing the core wholesaling
business with complementary businesses. The senior management of each of
AmeriSource and Bergen has periodically reviewed these strategic opportunities
with their respective boards.

         In February of 2000, R. David Yost, Chairman, President and Chief
Executive Officer of AmeriSource, and Robert E. Martini, Chairman and Chief
Executive Officer of Bergen, initiated conversations regarding a potential
business combination involving AmeriSource and Bergen through a stock-for-stock
merger of equals. Following some initial discussions, AmeriSource retained legal
counsel and Goldman Sachs as its financial advisor. Bergen retained legal
counsel and Merrill Lynch as its financial advisor. In addition, after the
initial conversations, representatives of AmeriSource and Bergen engaged in
preliminary discussions and conducted preliminary due diligence reviews of the
other company in order to evaluate the merits of a potential business
combination. However, while the boards of directors of both companies considered
the strategic rationale of a proposed combination and regulatory considerations,
these discussions between the parties never progressed beyond preliminary
matters.

         In July of 2000, Mr. Yost and Mr. Martini resumed discussions of the
benefits of a potential merger of equals transaction and decided to attempt to
structure and negotiate the terms and conditions of such a transaction.

         Following this discussion, AmeriSource and Bergen entered into a mutual
confidentiality and standstill agreement, dated July 19, 2000. Following
execution of the confidentiality agreement, during the months of July and
August, 2000 representatives of AmeriSource and Bergen met on several occasions
to conduct further due diligence reviews of the other company and to discuss
potential synergies that could be realized through a business combination.
During this period, the legal and financial advisors of AmeriSource and Bergen
also began preliminary due diligence reviews of the companies and commenced
preliminary discussions regarding the terms and conditions of a transaction. The
legal advisors also began drafting and negotiating a merger agreement. However,
the parties never reached agreement, and the parties terminated negotiations in
early September, 2000.

         On December 4, 2000, following the announcement of the proposed
acquisition of Bindley Western Industries, Inc. by Cardinal Health, Inc., Mr.
Yost and Mr. Martini discussed the announced Cardinal Health - Bindley Western
merger and the implications of the transaction for the pharmaceutical
wholesaling industry. No further discussions between AmeriSource and Bergen were
planned.

         On December 21, 2000, Mr. Yost and Mr. Martini spoke and mutually
decided to resume discussions regarding a potential merger of equals
transaction. Following these initial discussions, Mr. Yost and Mr. Martini each
had separate conversations with a number of important customers of AmeriSource
or Bergen regarding a potential business combination and received expressions of
support from the customers for such a business combination between AmeriSource
and Bergen; certain of these customers contacted AmeriSource or Bergen on their
own initiative.

         In January of 2001, AmeriSource and Bergen, and their respective
advisors, intensified discussions and resumed due diligence efforts. On January
8 and 9, senior management of AmeriSource and Bergen, along with their
respective legal and financial advisors, met to discuss a possible merger of
equals transaction and to conduct financial due diligence. During these
meetings, the parties discussed the material terms of a possible transaction,
including management of the combined company, the terms of a draft merger
agreement, the exchange ratio and required regulatory approvals. Although no
agreement was reached regarding the proposed transaction, future discussions
were contemplated and each party continued to conduct due diligence.

         During the month of January and the first half of February 2001,
representatives of AmeriSource and Bergen and their respective auditors
investigated and discussed whether the proposed merger could be accounted for as
a "pooling of interests" for financial reporting purposes. Following these
investigations and discussions, AmeriSource and Bergen determined that the
proposed merger would likely be accounted for as a "purchase transaction" for
financial reporting purposes and considered the implications of accounting for
the proposed merger as a "purchase transaction" under current accounting rules
on the reported earnings, if any, of the combined AmeriSource and Bergen entity
following a merger.

         On February 7, 2001, senior management of AmeriSource and Bergen, along
with their respective legal and financial advisors, met to continue discussions
of the material terms of the proposed transaction, including the accounting
treatment of the potential merger. While the meeting concluded without agreement
on the terms of the proposed transaction, representatives of AmeriSource and
Bergen, as well as their respective advisors, thereafter intensified due
diligence activities and negotiations of a merger agreement and related
transaction agreements.

         On February 12 through 15, 2001, representatives of AmeriSource and
Bergen and certain financial advisors met to conduct due diligence reviews and
discuss synergies that could be realized as a result of the merger.

         On February 14, 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued
the Exposure Draft of the proposed Statement entitled Business Combinations and
Intangible Assets - Accounting for Goodwill, dated February 14, 2001, proposing,
among other things, that goodwill not be amortized unless such goodwill is found
to be impaired in which case an impairment charge would be taken to reduce
goodwill to its fair value.

         On February 21, 2001, representatives of AmeriSource and Bergen and
their respective legal and financial advisors again met to discuss the proposed
transaction, including consummating the merger through a newly established
holding company and that the proposed merger be conditioned on the Financial
Accounting Standards

Board promulgating a final Statement of Financial Accounting Standards that
provides for accounting treatment of the merger in all material respects as in
the Exposure Draft of the proposed Statement entitled Business Combinations and
Intangible Assets - Accounting for Goodwill, dated February 14, 2001. During
this meeting, there were again discussions, but no agreement about an
appropriate exchange ratio and governance and management structure for the
merged entity. However, following this meeting, Mr. Yost and Mr. Martini
continued to discuss the terms of the proposed transaction in a series of
meetings and telephone conversations over the next three weeks. In addition, the
parties' legal advisors continued to negotiate a definitive merger agreement and
other agreements related to the proposed transaction.

         On the afternoon of Monday, March 12, 2001, the board of directors of
Bergen held a special meeting to discuss the progress of negotiations with
AmeriSource. At this meeting, senior management of Bergen presented the
strategic rationale for a possible transaction to the Bergen board of directors
and the preliminary results of its business and financial due diligence review
of AmeriSource. In addition, Bergen's legal advisors discussed with Bergen's
board of directors its fiduciary duties under applicable law and the results of
their legal due diligence review, described to the board of directors the
proposed terms and conditions of the proposed merger agreement, stock option
agreements and support/voting agreements, as well as those terms and conditions
still under negotiation, discussed regulatory considerations and responded to
questions from directors. Merrill Lynch also presented a summary of its
financial analysis relating to the proposed merger at this Bergen board meeting.

         During the week of March 12, 2001, representatives of AmeriSource and
Bergen, together with their respective financial advisors and legal counsel,
continued to negotiate a definitive merger agreement and other related
agreements. In addition, the entering into, by Bergen with certain executive
officers of Bergen, letter amendments relating to the amendment of existing
employment and severance agreements and other compensation arrangements was a
condition to AmeriSource's willingness to agree to the proposed business
combination.

         On the afternoon of Friday, March 16, 2001, the board of directors of
AmeriSource held a special meeting to consider the proposed merger of equals
transaction. At this meeting, the management of AmeriSource presented the
strategic rationale for the transaction to the board and the results of its due
diligence review of the other company. In addition, AmeriSource's legal advisors
discussed with the board of directors its fiduciary duties under applicable law,
described to the board of directors the terms of the proposed merger agreement,
stock option agreements and voting/support agreements, discussed regulatory
considerations and responded to questions from directors. In addition,
AmeriSource's legal advisors described the material terms of the proposed
AmeriSource rights agreement. At this AmeriSource board meeting, Goldman Sachs
presented a summary of its financial analyses relating to the proposed merger
and delivered its opinion that, as of such dates and based upon and subject to
certain matters discussed with the AmeriSource board of directors, the ratio to
exchange shares of AmeriSource common stock for shares of AmeriSource-Bergen
common stock pursuant to the proposed merger agreement was fair from a financial
point of view to the holders of AmeriSource common stock. Following
deliberations, the board of directors of AmeriSource unanimously approved the
merger agreement and the related agreements and the transactions contemplated by
those agreements and resolved to recommend that AmeriSource shareholders vote to
approve and adopt the merger agreement.

         During the evening of Friday, March 16, 2001, the board of directors of
Bergen held a telephonic special meeting to consider the proposed merger. At
this meeting, Bergen's legal advisors described to the board of directors the
revised terms of the proposed merger agreement, stock option agreements and
support/voting agreements, confirmed to the board the results of their due
diligence review and responded to questions from directors. In addition, Merrill
Lynch summarized its financial analysis relating to the proposed merger and
orally delivered its opinion that the proposed exchange ratio in the merger was
fair to Bergen shareholders from a financial point of view and a written opinion
dated the same day was subsequently delivered. Following deliberations, the
Bergen board of directors unanimously approved the merger agreement and the
related agreements and the transactions contemplated by those agreements and
resolved to recommend that Bergen shareholders vote to approve and adopt the
merger agreement.

         After negotiating the final terms of the merger agreement and the
related agreements, Mr. Yost and Mr. Martini executed the merger agreement and
the stock option agreements, and certain executives of AmeriSource and Bergen
executed voting/support agreements. In addition, Bergen negotiated and entered
into letter amendments with Neil F. Dimick, Brent R. Martini, Charles J.
Carpenter, and Steven H. Collis pursuant to which these four executive officers
of Bergen agreed to amend their existing employment and severance agreements and
other compensation arrangements.

         On the morning of Monday, March 19, 2001, AmeriSource and Bergen issued
a joint press release announcing the transaction.

AMERISOURCE'S REASONS FOR THE MERGER

         After careful consideration, AmeriSource's board of directors
unanimously determined the merger to be fair to the shareholders of AmeriSource
and in the best interests of AmeriSource and its shareholders. AMERISOURCE'S
BOARD OF DIRECTORS UNANIMOUSLY APPROVED THE MERGER AGREEMENT AND THE MERGER AND
UNANIMOUSLY RECOMMENDS YOUR APPROVAL AND ADOPTION OF THE MERGER AGREEMENT AND
THE MERGER.

         In the course of reaching its decision to approve the merger agreement
and the transactions contemplated thereby, the AmeriSource board of directors
consulted with AmeriSource's legal and financial advisors as well as with
AmeriSource's management, and considered a number of factors, including, among
others:

         -        the strategic and geographic fit between AmeriSource and
                  Bergen;

         -        the common culture of AmeriSource and Bergen with respect to
                  the importance of outstanding service and for making customer
                  satisfaction paramount;

         -        the opportunity for improved working capital and for an
                  increase in operating cash flow through synergies and cost
                  savings through facilities rationalization, elimination of
                  redundant overhead, improved inventory and capital usage,
                  particularly by creating higher-volume, state-of-the-art
                  distribution centers in place of lower volume, less efficient
                  distribution centers;

         -        the opportunity to reduce marginal operating costs for the
                  combined company below levels which either party could achieve
                  independently, enabling these savings to be passed on to
                  customers in the form of greater value and enhanced services,
                  while maintaining an acceptable level of profitability;

         -        management's expectation that even before consideration of any
                  synergies the merger will be accretive to earnings of the
                  combined company under new accounting standards before special
                  charges and integration related costs, as compared to
                  AmeriSource's stand-alone earnings expectations;

         -        the opinion of Goldman, Sachs & Co., AmeriSource's financial
                  advisor, that, as of the date of its opinion and based upon
                  and subject to certain matters stated in such opinion, the
                  ratio to exchange shares of AmeriSource common stock for
                  shares of AmeriSource-Bergen common stock pursuant to the
                  merger agreement was fair from a financial point a view to the
                  holders of shares of AmeriSource common stock;

         -        the opportunity to enhance and expand programs and services
                  AmeriSource currently offers to its customers;

         -        the complementary nature of the two companies businesses with
                  AmeriSource's leadership in the acute care business, strength
                  with independent community pharmacies, and focus on regional
                  drugstore chains, and Bergen's leadership in the long-term
                  care pharmacy business, strength in independent community
                  pharmacies, and focus on national and regional drugstore
                  chains,

                  worker's compensation business, and ASD's specialty healthcare
                  offerings in oncology, vaccines and biotech products;

         -        the opportunity to serve AmeriSource's customers better by
                  combining AmeriSource's Health Packaging unit and Bergen's
                  PharMerica and drug distribution operations; and

         -        a strong management team drawn from AmeriSource and Bergen to
                  work together to integrate the companies.

         The AmeriSource board of directors also considered a number of
potential risks and disadvantages relating to the merger, including the
following risks and disadvantages:

         -        the difficulty and management distraction inherent in
                  integrating two large and geographically dispersed operations
                  and the risk that the synergies and benefits sought in the
                  merger might not be fully achieved;

         -        the cost of Bergen's severance payments in connection with the
                  consummation of the merger;

         -        the risk that the merger would not be consummated including
                  the risk that the merger will not be approved by the Federal
                  Trade Commission and the risk that the Financial Accounting
                  Standards Board will not promulgate a final Statement of
                  Financial Accounting Standard which provides for accounting
                  treatment of the merger in all material respects as in the
                  Exposure Draft of the proposed Statement entitled Business
                  Combinations and Intangible Assets - Accounting for Goodwill,
                  dated February 14, 2001; and

         -        the substantial expenses expected to be incurred by
                  AmeriSource and Bergen in connection with the merger.

         The AmeriSource board of directors believed that these potential risks
and disadvantages were greatly outweighed by the potential benefits anticipated
to be realized from the merger.

         The foregoing discussion of the factors considered by the AmeriSource
board of directors is not intended to be exhaustive. In view of the wide variety
of factors considered in connection with its evaluation of the merger, the
AmeriSource board of directors did not find it practicable to quantify or
otherwise attempt to assign relative weights to the specific factors considered
in reaching its determinations. In addition, individual AmeriSource directors
may have given differing weights to different factors. The AmeriSource board of
directors considered all these factors as a whole, and overall considered them
to be favorable to and to support its determination to approve the merger.

         THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS OF AMERISOURCE RECOMMENDS THAT THE HOLDERS OF
AMERISOURCE CLASS A COMMON STOCK VOTE FOR THE APPROVAL AND ADOPTION OF THE
MERGER AGREEMENT.

BERGEN'S REASONS FOR THE MERGER

         After careful consideration, Bergen's board of directors unanimously
determined the merger to be fair to the shareholders of Bergen and in the best
interests of Bergen and its shareholders. BERGEN'S BOARD OF DIRECTORS
UNANIMOUSLY APPROVED THE MERGER AGREEMENT AND THE MERGER AND UNANIMOUSLY
RECOMMENDS YOUR APPROVAL AND ADOPTION OF THE MERGER AGREEMENT.

         In the course of reaching its decision to approve and adopt the merger
agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, and the merger, Bergen's
board of directors consulted with Bergen's legal and financial advisors as well
as with Bergen's management, and considered a number of factors, including:

         -        the opportunities for economies of scale, synergies and
                  enhanced services available through a combination of Bergen
                  and AmeriSource, the benefits of which could be shared with
                  customers, including the rationalization of facilities and the
                  establishment of new, more efficient distribution

                  centers, both of which could result in reduced marginal
                  operating costs and an improved credit rating, as well as
                  greater access to financing sources and a reduction in the
                  cost of capital;

         -        the fact that the per share consideration to be received by
                  Bergen shareholders in the merger represents a premium of
                  approximately 12% based on the closing price of the Bergen
                  common stock and AmeriSource common stock on the last trading
                  day prior to the announcement of the signing of the merger
                  agreement;

         -        management's expectation that the merger will be accretive to
                  earnings of the combined company under the proposed new
                  accounting standard before special charges and integration
                  related costs and before consideration of any synergies, as
                  compared to Bergen's stand-alone earnings expectations;

         -        the strategic and geographic fit between Bergen and
                  AmeriSource and the complementary nature of Bergen's and
                  AmeriSource's customer bases;

         -        the common culture of Bergen and AmeriSource which demands
                  outstanding service and makes customer satisfaction paramount;

         -        advice of legal counsel concerning the likelihood that the
                  merger would be permitted by antitrust authorities and the
                  fact that, subsequent to the announcement of Cardinal Health's
                  acquisition of Bindley Western, Bergen customers had
                  communicated that they would be in favor of a combination
                  involving Bergen and AmeriSource in the belief that such a
                  combined entity would be a stronger alternative source of
                  products and services in the industry;

         -        the assessment of Bergen's strategic alternatives to the
                  merger, including remaining an independent public company,
                  pursuing acquisitions or merging or consolidating with a party
                  other than AmeriSource, including parties outside of the
                  pharmaceutical wholesaling industry, and the likely benefits
                  to customers, employees and shareholders of such alternatives;

         -        the opportunity to enhance and expand programs and services
                  Bergen currently offers to its customers and the opportunity
                  to improve customer service by implementing the best practices
                  of Bergen and AmeriSource in a variety of service-oriented
                  aspects of the combined companies' business;

         -        the expected tax treatment of the merger for U.S. federal
                  income tax purposes;

         -        the fact that the merger will be accounted for under the
                  purchase method and the likelihood that proposed new
                  accounting and financial reporting rules will be promulgated
                  that will result in more favorable reporting of the financial
                  results of AmeriSource-Bergen than under current accounting
                  and financial reporting rules, and the advice of advisors
                  concerning the likelihood of the adoption of new standards;

         -        the opinion of Merrill Lynch & Co., Bergen's financial
                  advisor, that, as of the date of its opinion and based on and
                  subject to the factors and assumptions set forth in its
                  opinion, the ratio for the exchange of shares of Bergen common
                  stock for shares of AmeriSource-Bergen common stock pursuant
                  to the merger agreement was fair from a financial point a view
                  to the holders of common stock of Bergen;

         -        the fact that the merger provides for a fixed exchange ratio
                  and, as a result, the number of shares of AmeriSource-Bergen
                  common stock to be received by Bergen shareholders and their
                  ownership interest in AmeriSource-Bergen will remain fixed
                  notwithstanding increases or decreases in the value of Bergen
                  common stock as compared to increases or decreases in the
                  value of AmeriSource common stock during the period of time
                  between execution of the merger agreement and closing of the
                  merger;

         -        the opportunity of Bergen shareholders to continue as
                  shareholders of a combined organization with greater financial
                  and market strength than Bergen on a stand-alone basis, and
                  having strategic

                  goals and an operating philosophy similar to and compatible
                  with those of Bergen, stressing growth within the healthcare
                  industry, and the assessment that the greater resources that
                  will be available to Bergen following the merger are important
                  to the long-term future of Bergen;

         -        the fact that the merger is structured as a "merger of equals"
                  with the establishment of a new holding company and provides
                  that the board of directors of AmeriSource-Bergen will
                  initially consist of an equal number of individuals designated
                  by each of Bergen and AmeriSource and that Robert E. Martini
                  will serve as Chairman; in addition, that the merger agreement
                  provides that senior executives of Bergen will continue to
                  serve as senior executives of AmeriSource-Bergen, as Executive
                  Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Senior Vice
                  President and President of AmeriSource-Bergen Drug Company,
                  Senior Vice President and President of PharMerica and Senior
                  Vice President and President of ASD, and that these executives
                  will serve on the Executive Management Committee of
                  AmeriSource-Bergen;

         -        the fact that Bergen has long-standing employment arrangements
                  with its executives that protect such executives in the event
                  they are terminated by AmeriSource-Bergen without cause or
                  they leave for good reason after the consummation of the
                  merger and the willingness of certain Bergen executives to
                  amend their existing employment and severance agreements and
                  other compensation arrangements to accommodate the wishes of
                  AmeriSource is intended to facilitate the continuity of
                  management of AmeriSource-Bergen; and

         -        a strong management team drawn from Bergen and AmeriSource to
                  work together to integrate and lead the companies.

         The Bergen board of directors also considered a number of potential
risks and disadvantages relating to the merger, including the following risks
and disadvantages:

         -        the difficulty and management distraction inherent in
                  integrating two large and geographically dispersed operations
                  and the risk that the synergies and benefits sought in the
                  merger might not be fully achieved;

         -        the fact that the merger provides for a fixed exchange ratio
                  and, as a result, the number of shares of AmeriSource-Bergen
                  common stock to be received by Bergen shareholders and their
                  ownership interest will remain fixed notwithstanding decreases
                  in the value of AmeriSource common stock as compared to
                  increases or decreases in the value of Bergen common stock
                  during the period of time between the execution of the merger
                  agreement and the closing of the merger;

         -        the risk that the merger would not be consummated including
                  the risk that the merger will not be approved by the Federal
                  Trade Commission and the risk that the Financial Accounting
                  Standards Board will not promulgate a final Statement of
                  Financial Accounting Standards which provides for accounting
                  treatment of the merger in all material respects as in the
                  Exposure Draft of the proposed Statement entitled Business
                  Combinations and Intangible Assets - Accounting for Goodwill,
                  dated February 14, 2001; and

         -        the substantial expenses expected to be incurred by Bergen and
                  AmeriSource in connection with the merger.

         The Bergen board of directors believed that these potential risks and
disadvantages were greatly outweighed by the potential benefits anticipated to
be realized from the merger.

         The foregoing discussion of the factors considered by the Bergen board
of directors is not intended to be exhaustive. In view of the wide variety of
factors considered in connection with its evaluation of the merger, the Bergen
board of directors did not find it practicable to quantify or otherwise attempt
to assign relative weights to the specific factors considered in reaching its
determinations. The order of the factors does not necessarily reduce their
relative significance. In addition, individual Bergen directors may have given
differing weights to different factors.

The Bergen board of directors considered all these factors as a whole, and
overall considered them to be favorable to and to support its determination to
approve the merger.

         THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS OF BERGEN RECOMMENDS THAT THE HOLDERS OF BERGEN
COMMON STOCK VOTE FOR THE APPROVAL AND ADOPTION OF THE MERGER AGREEMENT.

RECOMMENDATION OF AMERISOURCE'S BOARD OF DIRECTORS

         The AmeriSource board of directors believes that the merger is fair to
you and in your best interest, and unanimously voted to approve the merger
agreement and unanimously recommends that you vote for the approval and adoption
of the merger agreement.

         In considering the recommendation of the AmeriSource board of directors
with respect to the merger agreement, you should be aware that certain directors
and executive officers of AmeriSource have interests in the merger that are
different from, or are in addition to, the interests of AmeriSource
shareholders. Please see the section entitled "Interests of Certain AmeriSource
Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger" that begins on page 51 of this
joint proxy statement-prospectus.

OPINION OF AMERISOURCE'S FINANCIAL ADVISOR

         On March 16, 2001, Goldman Sachs & Co. delivered its oral opinion,
which it confirmed in a written opinion dated March 16, 2001, to the board of
directors of AmeriSource that, as of the date of such opinion, the ratio to
exchange shares of AmeriSource common stock for shares of AmeriSource-Bergen
common stock pursuant to the merger agreement was fair from a financial point of
view to the holders of shares of AmeriSource common stock.

         THE FULL TEXT OF THE WRITTEN OPINION OF GOLDMAN SACHS, DATED MARCH 16,
2001, WHICH SETS FORTH ASSUMPTIONS MADE, MATTERS CONSIDERED AND LIMITATIONS ON
THE REVIEW UNDERTAKEN IN CONNECTION WITH THE OPINION, IS ATTACHED AS ANNEX H TO
THIS JOINT PROXY STATEMENT-PROSPECTUS AND IS INCORPORATED HEREIN BY REFERENCE.
GOLDMAN SACHS PROVIDED ITS ADVISORY SERVICES AND ITS OPINION FOR THE INFORMATION
AND ASSISTANCE OF THE AMERISOURCE BOARD OF DIRECTORS IN CONNECTION WITH ITS
CONSIDERATION OF THE MERGER. IT IS NOT A RECOMMENDATION AS TO HOW ANY HOLDER OF
SHARES OF AMERISOURCE COMMON STOCK SHOULD VOTE AT THE AMERISOURCE MEETING.
HOLDERS OF AMERISOURCE COMMON STOCK ARE URGED TO AND SHOULD READ THE OPINION IN
ITS ENTIRETY.

         In connection with its opinion, Goldman Sachs reviewed, among other
things:

         -        the merger agreement;

         -        the annual reports to shareholders and annual reports on Form
                  10-K of AmeriSource and Bergen for the five fiscal years ended
                  September 30, 2000;

         -        a number of interim reports to shareholders and quarterly
                  reports on Form 10-Q of AmeriSource and Bergen;

         -        a number of other communications from AmeriSource and Bergen
                  to their respective shareholders; and

         -        a number of internal financial analyses and forecasts for
                  AmeriSource and Bergen prepared by their respective
                  managements, including certain cost savings and operating
                  synergies projected by the management of AmeriSource to result
                  from the merger (sometimes referred to as the synergies).

         Goldman Sachs also held discussions with members of the senior
managements of AmeriSource and Bergen regarding their assessment of the
strategic rationale for and the potential benefits of the merger and the past
and current business operations, financial condition and future prospects of
their respective companies. In addition,

Goldman Sachs reviewed the reported price and trading activity for the
AmeriSource common stock and the Bergen common stock, compared certain financial
and stock market information for AmeriSource and Bergen with similar information
for several other companies the securities of which are publicly traded and
reviewed the financial terms of several recent business combinations in the
healthcare distribution industry specifically and in other industries generally.
Goldman Sachs also performed such other studies and analyses that it considered
appropriate.

         Goldman Sachs relied upon the accuracy and completeness of all of the
financial, accounting and other information discussed with or reviewed by it and
assumed that accuracy and completeness for purposes of rendering its opinion. In
addition, Goldman Sachs did not make an independent evaluation or appraisal of
the assets and liabilities of AmeriSource or Bergen or any of their respective
subsidiaries. No evaluation or appraisal of the assets and liabilities of
AmeriSource or Bergen or any of their respective subsidiaries was furnished to
Goldman Sachs. Goldman Sachs assumed that the internal financial forecasts
prepared by the managements of AmeriSource and Bergen were reasonably prepared
on a basis reflecting the best currently available estimates and judgments of
AmeriSource and Bergen, that the synergies were reasonably prepared on a basis
reflecting the best currently available estimates and judgments of AmeriSource
and that such synergies will be realized in the amounts and at the time periods
contemplated thereby. Goldman Sachs also assumed that all material governmental,
regulatory or other consents and approvals necessary for the consummation of the
merger will be obtained without any adverse effect on the combined company
following the merger or on AmeriSource or Bergen or the contemplated benefits of
the merger.

         Additionally, Goldman Sachs assumed that the Financial Accounting
Standards Board will have promulgated a final Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards with an effective date no later than the closing of the merger, which
shall provide for accounting treatment of the merger in all material respects as
in the Exposure Draft of the proposed Statement entitled Business Combinations
and Intangible Assets - Accounting for Goodwill, dated February 14, 2001.

         Goldman Sachs provided its advisory services and its opinion for the
information and assistance of the AmeriSource board of directors in connection
with its consideration of the merger. The Goldman Sachs opinion is not a
recommendation as to how any holder of shares of AmeriSource common stock should
vote.

         The following is a summary of the material financial analyses used by
Goldman Sachs in connection with providing its March 16, 2001 written opinion to
the AmeriSource board of directors. Some of the summaries of the financial
analyses include information presented in tabular format. In order to more fully
understand the financial analyses used by Goldman Sachs, the tables must be read
together with the full text of each summary. The tables alone do not constitute
a complete description of Goldman Sachs' financial analyses.

         (1) Historical Exchange Ratio Analysis. Goldman Sachs reviewed the
historical trading prices for Bergen common stock and AmeriSource common stock
in order to compare the Bergen exchange ratio relative to the AmeriSource
exchange ratio of 0.370 to the historical exchange ratios of Bergen common stock
to AmeriSource common stock. Goldman Sachs reviewed the historical prices for
Bergen and AmeriSource for the five year period ended March 13, 2001. Goldman
Sachs' analysis indicated the following average historical exchange ratios of
Bergen common stock to AmeriSource common stock and implied exchange ratio
premiums to the holders of shares of Bergen common stock:

                          Average Bergen Common Stock to     Implied Exchange Ratio
                             AmeriSource Common Stock        Premium / (Discount) to
    Historical Period             Exchange Ratio               Bergen Shareholders
- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

         5 Years                      0.586x                         (36.9%)
          1 Year                      0.287x                          28.7%
        6 Months                      0.297x                          24.7%
        3 Months                      0.335x                          10.4%
         1 Month                      0.328x                          12.6%

     March 13, 2001                   0.330x                          12.0%

         (2) Selected Transactions Analysis. This analysis was undertaken to
provide information regarding the fairness of the ratio to exchange shares of
AmeriSource common stock for shares of AmeriSource-Bergen common stock based
upon a comparison of the financial terms of the merger with the financial terms
of several other comparable business combinations involving national
distributors in the drug distribution industry since 1997. Goldman Sachs
compared the following acquisitions:

         -        Cardinal Health, Inc.'s acquisition of Bindley Western
                  Industries, Inc. completed in February 2001;

         -        McKesson Corporation's proposed acquisition of AmeriSource
                  that was terminated prior to its closing; and

         -        Cardinal Health, Inc.'s proposed acquisition of Bergen that
                  was terminated prior to its closing.

         Goldman Sachs calculated and compared for each of the selected drug
distribution industry transactions (i) the transaction value as a multiple of
latest twelve month net income, (ii) the levered transaction value as a multiple
of:

         -        latest twelve months earnings before interest and taxes,
                  sometimes referred to as EBIT, and

         -        latest twelve months earnings before interest, taxes,
                  depreciation and amortization, sometimes referred to as
                  EBITDA,

and (iii) the premium to market price one day prior to the announcement of each
transaction, each as compared to the corresponding values indicated for the
merger.

         The following table presents the results of this analysis.

                                                                                       Valuation of
                                                             Ranges for the         Bergen as Part of
                     Multiple                             Selected Transactions         the Merger
                     --------                             ---------------------         ----------

Transaction value as a multiple of LTM Net Income             29.4x - 37.8x                31.9x
Levered transaction value as a multiple of LTM EBIT           16.4x - 20.0x                13.5x
Levered transaction value as a multiple of LTM EBITDA         13.3x - 17.5x                10.6x
Premium over Market Value                                     28.9% - 61.3%                12.0%

         In addition, Goldman Sachs also compared the combined company's name,
headquarters location, ownership and corporate governance for each of the
selected drug distribution industry transactions as follows:

                                                  Approximate Pro      Pro Forma Board
                          Name (Headquarters)   Forma Ownership of     Representation

         Goldman Sachs also compared the Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and
Chief Operating Officer positions for each of the combined companies as follows:

                                                                Chairman, Chief Executive Officer

         (3) Selected Companies Analysis. Goldman Sachs reviewed and compared
financial information of AmeriSource to corresponding financial information,
ratios and public market multiples for selected wholesale pharmaceutical
distributor companies. Goldman Sachs selected the following companies for
comparison because they are publicly traded companies with certain operations
that for purposes of analysis may be considered similar to certain operations of
AmeriSource. The selected publicly traded wholesale pharmaceutical distributor
companies consisted of:

                  -        Bergen,

                  -        Cardinal Health, Inc., and

                  -        McKesson HBOC, Inc.

         Goldman Sachs calculated and compared various financial multiples and
ratios for the selected companies based on the latest publicly available
financial statements and calendarized price to earnings multiples and projected
5-year compound annual earnings per share growth rates based on IBES, Inc.
median estimates. The operating items data exclude one time gains and charges,
the data for Cardinal Health is pro forma for the acquisition of Bindley
Western, and the enterprise value of McKesson includes mandatorily redeemable
securities. The multiples for the selected companies were calculated using
closing per share prices as of March 13, 2001. With respect to the selected
companies, Goldman Sachs considered:

         -        closing share price on March 13, 2001 as a percentage of the
                  52 week high closing share price,

         -        enterprise value as a multiple of latest twelve month EBITDA,

         -        enterprise value as a multiple of latest twelve month EBIT,

         -        estimated 2001 and 2002 calendarized median price to earnings
                  multiples,

         -        projected five year compound annual earnings per share growth
                  rate, sometimes referred to as CAGR, and

         -        estimated 2001 price to earnings multiple as a multiple of
                  projected five year earnings per share CAGR.

         The results of these analyses are summarized in the following tables.

                                                                Enterprise Value as Multiple of LTM

         (4) Pro Forma Merger Analysis. Goldman Sachs prepared a pro forma
analysis of the financial impact of the merger using IBES, Inc. estimates for
AmeriSource and Bergen as of March 13, 2001. For each of the estimated fiscal
years 2002 and 2003, Goldman Sachs analyzed the accretion or dilution to
earnings per share of the common stock of the combined company on a pro forma
basis under current purchase accounting, assuming goodwill is amortized over 40
years, and under the proposed new purchase accounting, assuming goodwill is not
amortized and is written down only if impaired. Goldman Sachs performed this
analysis based on the AmeriSource closing share price of $50.69 on March 13,
2001, and under the scenario that no synergies are realized, under the scenario
that management's assumptions of pre-tax synergies are realized, and under the
scenario that management's assumptions of pre-tax synergies are realized and
including extraordinary items. The analysis under the proposed new purchase
accounting rules indicated that without synergies the merger would be modestly
accretive on an earnings per share basis in 2002 and 2003, with synergies the
merger would be significantly accretive on an earnings per share basis in 2002
and 2003, and with synergies and including extraordinary items the merger would
be moderately accretive on an earnings per share basis in 2002 and 2003.

         (5) Contribution Analysis. Goldman Sachs reviewed historical and
estimated future operating and financial information including, among other
things, sales, EBITDA, EBIT, net income, equity market capitalization on a
diluted basis, and enterprise value, assuming net debt of $530.8 million for
AmeriSource as of December 31, 2000 and $1,344.9 million for Bergen as of
December 31, 2000, for AmeriSource, Bergen, and the pro forma combined

entity resulting from the merger based on AmeriSource and Bergen managements'
financial forecasts dated March 3, 2001 and January 5, 2001, respectively.

         A contribution analysis demonstrates the parties' respective historical
and projected contributions, on a percentage basis, to certain balance sheet and
income statement items of the combined company and compares such contributions
to the parties' shareholders' relative equity interests in the combined company
following the merger.

         Goldman Sachs noted that AmeriSource shareholders' pro forma ownership
of the common equity of the combined company after the merger would be 52%
(assuming the exercise of options of AmeriSource and Bergen outstanding as of
September 30, 2000), based on the Bergen exchange ratio relative to the
AmeriSource exchange ratio of 0.37. The analysis indicated that AmeriSource
would contribute 54.7% of the equity market capitalization and 47.5% of the
enterprise value to the combined entity based on closing stock prices on March
13, 2001. Goldman Sachs also analyzed the relative income statement contribution
of AmeriSource and Bergen to the combined company on a pro forma basis based on
the scenario assuming no synergies and based on financial data and on the
assumptions provided to Goldman Sachs by AmeriSource and Bergen managements for
fiscal year 2000 and estimated fiscal year 2001.

         The results of these analyses are summarized as follows:

                     AmeriSource's Contribution to Combined Entity
                     ---------------------------------------------
                 Sales         EBITDA          EBIT         Net Income

FY 2000A         38.3%          37.2%          41.4%          55.0%
FY 2001E         40.4%          36.7%          39.1%          52.0%

         General. The preparation of a fairness opinion is a complex process and
is not necessarily susceptible to partial analysis or summary description.
Selecting portions of the analyses or of the summary set forth above, without
considering the analyses as a whole, could create an incomplete view of the
processes underlying Goldman Sachs' opinion. In arriving at its fairness
determination, Goldman Sachs considered the results of each of these analyses in
their totality. No company or transaction used in the above analyses as a
comparison is directly comparable to AmeriSource or Bergen or the merger. The
analyses were prepared solely for purposes of Goldman Sachs' providing its
opinion to AmeriSource's board of directors as to the fairness from a financial
point of view of the ratio to exchange shares of AmeriSource common stock for
shares of AmeriSource-Bergen common stock pursuant to the merger agreement to
the holders of shares of AmeriSource common stock and do not purport to be
appraisals or necessarily reflect the prices at which businesses or securities
actually may be sold. Analyses based upon forecasts of future results are not
necessarily indicative of actual future results, which may be significantly more
or less favorable than suggested by those analyses. Because these analyses are
inherently subject to uncertainty, being based upon numerous factors or events
beyond the control of the parties or their advisors, none of AmeriSource,
Bergen, Goldman Sachs or any other person assumes responsibility if future
results are materially different from those forecast. As described above,
Goldman Sachs' opinion to AmeriSource's board of directors was one of many
factors taken into consideration by AmeriSource's board of directors in making
its determination to approve the merger agreement. This summary is not a
complete description of the analysis performed by Goldman Sachs and is qualified
by reference to the written opinion of Goldman Sachs set forth in Annex H.

         Goldman Sachs, as part of its investment banking business, is
continually engaged in the valuation of businesses and their securities in
connection with mergers and acquisitions, negotiated underwritings, competitive
biddings, secondary distributions of listed and unlisted securities, private
placements and valuations for estate, corporate and other purposes. Goldman
Sachs is familiar with AmeriSource, having provided certain investment banking
services to AmeriSource from time to time, including having acted as lead
manager of its 144A offering of 5% Convertible Subordinated Notes due December
2007, aggregate principal amount $300 million, in December 2000 and having acted
as its financial advisor in connection with, and having participated in certain
of the

negotiations leading to, the merger agreement. Goldman Sachs has also provided
certain investment banking services to Bergen from time to time, including
having acted as a co-manager with respect to the public offering of Trust
Originated Preferred Securities by Bergen Capital I, a wholly owned subsidiary
of Bergen, aggregate principal amount $300 million, in May 1999. Goldman Sachs
provides a full range of financial advisory and securities services and, in the
course of its normal trading activities, may from time to time effect
transactions and hold securities, including derivative securities, of
AmeriSource or Bergen for its own account and for the accounts of customers.

         Pursuant to a letter agreement dated April 22, 2000, AmeriSource
engaged Goldman Sachs to act as its financial advisor in connection with a
possible transaction involving all or a portion of the stock or assets of
Bergen. Pursuant to the terms of the letter agreement, AmeriSource has agreed to
pay Goldman Sachs upon consummation of the merger a transaction fee of $13
million. AmeriSource has agreed to reimburse Goldman Sachs for its reasonable
out-of-pocket expenses, including attorney's fees, and to indemnify Goldman
Sachs against certain liabilities, including certain liabilities under the
federal securities laws.

RECOMMENDATION OF BERGEN'S BOARD OF DIRECTORS

         The Bergen board of directors believes that the merger is fair to you
and in your best interest, and unanimously voted to approve the merger agreement
and unanimously recommends that you vote for the approval and adoption of the
merger agreement.

         In considering the recommendation of the Bergen board of directors with
respect to the merger agreement, you should be aware that certain directors and
executive officers of Bergen have interests in the merger that are different
from, or are in addition to, the interests of Bergen shareholders. Please see
the section entitled "Interests of Certain Bergen Directors and Executive
Officers in the Merger" that begins on page 53 of this joint proxy
statement-prospectus.

OPINION OF BERGEN'S FINANCIAL ADVISOR

         Bergen retained Merrill Lynch to act as its financial advisor in
connection with a possible business combination with AmeriSource. On March 16,
2001, Merrill Lynch rendered its opinion, which it confirmed in a written
opinion dated March 16, 2001, to the Board of Directors of Bergen that, as of
such date and based upon and subject to the factors and assumptions set forth in
the opinion, the exchange ratio in the proposed merger of 0.37 of a share of
AmeriSource-Bergen common stock for each share of Bergen common stock was fair
from a financial point of view to the holders of Bergen common stock.

         THE FULL TEXT OF MERRILL LYNCH'S OPINION, WHICH SETS FORTH THE
ASSUMPTIONS MADE, MATTERS CONSIDERED, AND QUALIFICATIONS AND LIMITATIONS ON THE
REVIEW UNDERTAKEN BY MERRILL LYNCH, IS ATTACHED AS ANNEX I TO THIS JOINT PROXY
STATEMENT-PROSPECTUS AND IS INCORPORATED HEREIN BY REFERENCE. THE SUMMARY OF
MERRILL LYNCH'S OPINION SET FORTH IN THIS JOINT PROXY STATEMENT-PROSPECTUS IS
QUALIFIED IN ITS ENTIRETY BY REFERENCE TO THE FULL TEXT OF SUCH OPINION. THE
HOLDERS OF BERGEN COMMON STOCK ARE URGED TO READ SUCH OPINION IN ITS ENTIRETY.
MERRILL LYNCH'S OPINION WAS PROVIDED FOR THE USE AND BENEFIT OF THE BOARD OF
DIRECTORS OF BERGEN FOR ITS INFORMATION AND WAS DIRECTED ONLY TO THE FAIRNESS
FROM A FINANCIAL POINT OF VIEW OF THE EXCHANGE RATIO TO THE HOLDERS OF BERGEN
COMMON STOCK. MERRILL LYNCH'S OPINION DID NOT ADDRESS THE MERITS OF THE
UNDERLYING DECISION BY BERGEN TO ENGAGE IN THE MERGER AND DOES NOT CONSTITUTE A
RECOMMENDATION TO ANY HOLDER OF BERGEN COMMON STOCK AS TO HOW SUCH HOLDER SHOULD
VOTE ON THE PROPOSED MERGER.

         The exchange ratio was determined through negotiations between Bergen
and AmeriSource and was approved by the board of directors of Bergen. Merrill
Lynch provided advice to Bergen during the course of such negotiations.

         The summary set forth below does not purport to be a complete
description of the analyses underlying the Merrill Lynch opinion or the
presentations made by Merrill Lynch to the board of directors of Bergen. The
preparation of a fairness opinion is a complex analytic process involving
various determinations as to the most

appropriate and relevant methods of financial analysis and the application of
those methods to the particular circumstances and, therefore, such an opinion is
not readily susceptible to partial analysis or summary description. In arriving
at its opinion, Merrill Lynch did not attribute any particular weight to any
analysis or factor considered by it, but rather made qualitative judgments as to
the significance and relevance of each analysis and factor forming part of each
such analysis. While each factor set forth below is separate, Merrill Lynch
believes that its analyses must be considered as a whole and that selecting
portions of its analyses, without considering all analyses, would create an
incomplete view of the process underlying its opinion.

         In performing its analyses, Merrill Lynch made numerous assumptions
with respect to industry performance, general business, economic, market and
financial conditions and other matters, many of which are beyond the control of
Merrill Lynch or Bergen. Any estimates contained in the analyses performed by
Merrill Lynch are not necessarily indicative of actual values or future results,
which may be significantly more or less favorable than suggested by such
analyses. Additionally, estimates of the value of businesses or securities do
not purport to be appraisals or to reflect the prices at which such businesses
or securities might actually be sold. Accordingly, such analyses and estimates
are inherently subject to substantial uncertainty. In addition, as described
above, Merrill Lynch's opinion was among several factors taken into
consideration by the board of directors of Bergen in making its determination to
approve the merger agreement and the merger. Consequently, the analyses
performed by Merrill Lynch described below should not be viewed as determinative
of the decision of the board of directors of Bergen or Bergen's management with
respect to the fairness of the exchange ratio.

         In arriving at its opinion, Merrill Lynch, among other things,

         -        reviewed certain publicly available business and financial
                  information relating to Bergen and AmeriSource which Merrill
                  Lynch deemed to be relevant;

         -        reviewed certain information with respect to AmeriSource,
                  including financial forecast information, relating to the
                  business, earnings, cash flow, assets, liabilities and
                  prospects of AmeriSource, furnished to Merrill Lynch by
                  AmeriSource;

         -        reviewed certain information with respect to Bergen, including
                  financial forecast information from certain publicly available
                  analysts' forecasts provided by Bergen to Merrill Lynch as
                  reasonable forecasts appropriate for use in rendering its
                  opinion, relating to the business, earnings, cash flow,
                  assets, liabilities and prospects of Bergen, as well as
                  certain information relating to the amount and timing of the
                  cost savings and related expenses and synergies expected to
                  result from the merger, furnished to Merrill Lynch by Bergen;

         -        conducted discussions with members of senior management of
                  Bergen and AmeriSource concerning the matters described above,
                  as well as their respective businesses and prospects before
                  and after giving effect to the merger and the cost savings and
                  related expenses and synergies expected to result from the
                  merger;

         -        reviewed the market prices and valuation multiples for Bergen
                  common stock and AmeriSource common stock and compared them
                  with those of certain publicly traded companies which Merrill
                  Lynch deemed to be relevant;

         -        reviewed the results of operations of Bergen and AmeriSource
                  and compared them with those of certain publicly traded
                  companies which Merrill Lynch deemed to be relevant;

         -        compared the proposed financial terms of the merger with the
                  financial terms of certain other transactions which Merrill
                  Lynch deemed to be relevant;

         -        reviewed the potential pro forma impact of the merger, before
                  and after giving effect to the cost savings and related
                  expenses and synergies expected to result from the merger;

         -        reviewed the merger agreement, the stock option agreements
                  between Bergen and AmeriSource, the support/voting agreements
                  between AmeriSource and certain holders of Bergen common stock

                  and the support/voting agreements between Bergen and certain
                  holders of AmeriSource common stock;

         -        participated in certain discussions and negotiations among
                  representatives of Bergen and AmeriSource and their financial
                  and legal advisors; and

         -        reviewed such other financial studies and analyses and took
                  into account such other matters as Merrill Lynch deemed
                  necessary, including Merrill Lynch's assessment of general
                  economic, market and monetary conditions.

         In preparing its opinion, Merrill Lynch assumed and relied on the
accuracy and completeness of all information supplied or otherwise made
available to Merrill Lynch, discussed with or reviewed by or for Merrill Lynch,
or publicly available, and Merrill Lynch did not assume any responsibility for
independently verifying such information and Merrill Lynch has not undertaken an
independent evaluation or appraisal of any of the assets or liabilities of
Bergen or AmeriSource or been furnished with any such evaluation or appraisal.
In addition, Merrill Lynch did not assume any obligation to conduct any physical
inspection of the properties or facilities of Bergen or AmeriSource. With
respect to the financial forecast information and the cost savings and related
expenses and synergies expected to result from the merger furnished to or
discussed with Merrill Lynch by Bergen or AmeriSource, Merrill Lynch assumed
that they have been reasonably prepared or reviewed and reflect the best
currently available estimates and judgment of Bergen's or AmeriSource's
management as to the expected future financial performance of Bergen or
AmeriSource, as the case may be, and the cost savings and related expenses and
synergies expected to result from the merger. Merrill Lynch also assumed that
the merger will qualify as a tax-free reorganization for U.S. federal income tax
purposes and that all conditions to the merger will be satisfied, including with
respect to the promulgation of certain accounting rules.

         The Merrill Lynch opinion was necessarily based upon market, economic
and other conditions as they existed and could be evaluated on, and on the
information made available to Merrill Lynch as of, the date of the Merrill Lynch
opinion. Merrill Lynch assumed that in the course of obtaining the necessary
regulatory or other consents or approvals (contractual or otherwise) for the
merger, no restrictions, including any divestiture requirements or amendments or
modifications, would be imposed that would have a material adverse effect on the
contemplated benefits of the merger.

         In connection with the preparation of its opinion, Merrill Lynch was
not authorized by Bergen or the board of directors of Bergen to solicit, nor did
Merrill Lynch solicit, third-party indications of interest for the acquisition
of all or any part of Bergen.

         The following is a summary of the material valuation, financial and
comparative analyses presented by Merrill Lynch to the board of directors of
Bergen in connection with the rendering of its opinion.

         Historical Exchange Ratio Analysis. Merrill Lynch compared the exchange
ratio to the relative daily closing stock prices of Bergen and AmeriSource from
March 15, 2000 to March 15, 2001. The following table presents the average
historical implied exchange ratio resulting from this analysis:

                                           AVERAGE IMPLIED EXCHANGE RATIO
                                           ------------------------------

March 15, 2001                                         0.330
1 Week prior                                           0.324
1 Month prior                                          0.325
3 Months prior                                         0.336
6 Months prior                                         0.297
12 Months prior                                        0.287

         Relative Earnings Contribution Analysis. Merrill Lynch performed an
analysis of the pro forma relative contributions by each of Bergen and
AmeriSource to, among other things, the net income, cash earnings, revenues and
EBIT (earnings before interest and taxes) of AmeriSource-Bergen, in each case
before taking into account purchase accounting adjustments and cost savings and
related expenses and synergies expected to result from the merger. These
comparisons were calculated based upon the actual results before one-time items
of Bergen and AmeriSource for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2000 and the
estimated results of Bergen and AmeriSource for the fiscal years ending
September 30, 2001 and 2002. The following table presents the implied Bergen
exchange ratios, based on the percentage contributions of Bergen to
AmeriSource-Bergen's pro forma net income, cash earnings, revenues and EBIT,
resulting from this analysis:

                          2000                2001                  2002
                        (ACTUAL)           (ESTIMATED)           (ESTIMATED)
                        --------           -----------           -----------

Net Income                0.32x               0.36x                 0.38x
Cash Earnings             0.44x               0.41x                 0.42x
Revenues                  0.51x               0.43x                 0.40x

         Comparable Publicly Traded Company Analysis. Merrill Lynch reviewed
publicly available information as of March 15, 2001, to calculate specified
financial and operating information, market values and trading multiples (as
described below) and then compared such financial and operating information,
market values and trading multiples of Bergen as of March 15, 2001, with the
corresponding financial and operating information, market values and multiples
of a selected group of drug distribution companies consisting of Cardinal
Health, Inc., McKesson HBOC, Inc. and AmeriSource.

         Merrill Lynch derived an estimated valuation range for Bergen by
comparing:

         -        market capitalization (defined as market value plus total debt
                  and preferred stock less cash and cash equivalents) as of
                  March 15, 2001, as a multiple of estimated EBITDA (earnings
                  before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) for the
                  fiscal year ending September 30, 2001, for Cardinal Health,
                  Inc., McKesson HBOC, Inc. and AmeriSource, which estimates
                  ranged from 8.6x to 15.0x (as compared to a multiple of 9.4x
                  for Bergen);

         -        the price per share as a multiple of estimated earnings per
                  share (calculated in accordance with GAAP) for the fiscal
                  years ending September 30, 2001 and 2002, for Cardinal Health,
                  Inc. common stock, McKesson HBOC, Inc. common stock and
                  AmeriSource common stock, which estimates ranged from 21.8x to
                  29.4x for fiscal year 2001 and from 18.4x to 24.4x for fiscal
                  year 2002 (as compared to a multiple of 20.4x for fiscal year
                  2001 and 16.9x for fiscal year 2002 for Bergen common stock);

         -        the price per share as a multiple of estimated cash earnings
                  per share (calculated without deducting estimated goodwill
                  amortization from earnings) for the fiscal years ending
                  September 30, 2001 and 2002, for Cardinal Health, Inc. common
                  stock, McKesson HBOC, Inc. common stock and AmeriSource common
                  stock, which estimates ranged from 19.8x to 28.2x for fiscal
                  year 2001 and 16.4x to 23.5x for fiscal year 2002 (as compared
                  with 17.7x for fiscal year 2001 and 15.0x for fiscal year 2002
                  for Bergen common stock); and

         -        the ratio of price per share to earnings per share (calculated
                  in accordance with GAAP) for the fiscal year ending September
                  30, 2001, as a multiple of estimated 5-year compound annual
                  growth rates for earnings per share for Cardinal Health, Inc.
                  common stock, McKesson HBOC, Inc. common stock and AmeriSource
                  common stock, which estimates ranged from 1.21x to 1.47x (as
                  compared with 1.36x for Bergen common stock).

         Using this analysis, Merrill Lynch calculated the following ranges of
implied Bergen exchange ratios:

           MEASURE                       IMPLIED EXCHANGE RATIO
           -------                       ----------------------
                                       Low                   High
                                       ---                   ----

   2002                               0.342                  0.343

   2002                               0.355                  0.360

   2001                               0.404                  0.487
GAAP P/E/GROWTH
   2001                               0.294                  0.294

MEAN                                  0.346                  0.365

         None of the selected comparable companies listed above and used in the
above analysis is identical to Bergen. Accordingly, an analysis of the results
of the foregoing analysis is not purely mathematical. Rather, it involves
complex considerations and judgments concerning differences in financial and
operating characteristics of the comparable companies and other factors that
could affect the public trading value of the comparable companies or company to
which they are being compared.

         Relative Discounted Cash Flow Contribution Analysis. Using a discounted
cash flow analysis, Merrill Lynch calculated a range of implied Bergen exchange
ratios based on the implied per share values for Bergen and AmeriSource before
taking into account the cost savings and related expenses and synergies expected
to result from the merger. Such implied per share values were based on operating
projections of Bergen and AmeriSource management for the fiscal years ending
September 30, 2001 through 2005, a range of discount rates from 9% to 11% and a
range of 2005 terminal unlevered net income multiples of 17x to 23x. The implied
Bergen exchange ratios resulting from this analysis are summarized in the
following table:

      DISCOUNT RATE                     IMPLIED EXCHANGE RATIO
      -------------                     ----------------------
                                     LOW                     HIGH

           9.0%                     0.356                   0.391
          10.0%                     0.349                   0.386

         Pro Forma Merger Analysis. Merrill Lynch performed an analysis of the
potential pro forma financial impacts of the merger on the earnings per share of
Bergen common stock for the fiscal years ending September 30, 2001, 2002 and
2003, respectively, based upon Bergen's management operating projections. In
performing this analysis, Merrill Lynch assumed, among other things:

         -        the exchange ratio of 0.370;

         -        the merger was completed as of September 30, 2000;

         -        certain pre-tax synergies expected to result from cost
                  reduction initiatives following the closing of the merger
                  projected by the management of Bergen; and

         -        that the merger would be accounted for under new purchase
                  accounting rules (i.e., no goodwill amortization).

         The results of this analysis indicated that, including the impact of
the cost savings and related expenses and synergies expected to result from the
merger, the merger would be accretive to the projected cash earnings per share
of Bergen common stock by 6% in fiscal year 2001, 8% in fiscal year 2002 and 13%
in fiscal year 2003.

         Merrill Lynch also performed an analysis of the potential pro forma
impact of the merger on the per share value of Bergen common stock for the
fiscal years ending September 30, 2001, 2002 and 2003, respectively. Using the
assumptions outlined in the previous paragraphs, and based on an assumed pro
forma price/cash earnings ratio ranges for AmeriSource-Bergen derived from the
weighted average multiples for Bergen and AmeriSource as of March 15, 2001, to
26x for fiscal year 2001, to 22x for fiscal year 2002 and to 18x for fiscal year
2003, the results of this analysis indicated that, including the impact of the
cost savings and related expenses and synergies expected to result from the
merger, the merger would be accretive to the per share value of Bergen common
stock by 23% to 63% in fiscal year 2001, 32% to 75% in fiscal year 2002 and 40%
to 76% in fiscal year 2003.

         Merrill Lynch Financial Advisor Fee. Pursuant to a letter agreement
between Bergen and Merrill Lynch, dated as of March 16, 2001, Bergen agreed to
pay Merrill Lynch (i) a fee of $1 million upon the execution of the merger
agreement, (ii) a fee of $12 million upon the closing of the merger or certain
other transactions involving Bergen and AmeriSource and (iii) the lesser of $12
million or 10% of any fee, payment, judgment, amount or profit payable to Bergen
following or in connection with the termination, abandonment or failure to occur
of the merger or certain other transactions involving Bergen and AmeriSource.
Any fee paid pursuant to clause (i), however, will be deducted from any fee to
which Merrill Lynch is entitled to receive pursuant to clauses (ii) or (iii).
Bergen has also agreed to indemnify Merrill Lynch and certain related persons
for certain liabilities, including liabilities under the federal securities
laws, related to or arising out of the performance by Merrill Lynch of services
under its engagement. In addition to acting as financial advisor to Bergen in
connection with the merger, Merrill Lynch has, during the past two years,
advised Bergen in connection with a divestiture. In connection with the
provision of such services, Merrill Lynch received compensation from Bergen of
approximately $2.75 million.

         Bergen retained Merrill Lynch to act as its financial advisor in
connection with the merger based upon Merrill Lynch's qualifications,
experience, reputation and expertise. Merrill Lynch is an internationally
recognized investment banking and advisory firm. Merrill Lynch, as part of its
investment banking business, is continuously engaged in the valuation of
businesses and securities in connection with mergers and acquisitions,
negotiated underwritings, competitive biddings, secondary distributions of
listed and unlisted securities, private placements and valuations for corporate
and other purposes.

         Merrill Lynch has, in the past, provided financial advisory and
financing services to Bergen and may continue to do so and has received, and may
receive, fees for the rendering of such services. In addition, in the ordinary
course of its business, Merrill Lynch and its affiliates may actively trade
shares of Bergen common stock and other securities of Bergen, as well as shares
of AmeriSource common stock and other securities of AmeriSource, for their own
account and for the accounts of customers and, accordingly, may at any time hold
a long or short position in such securities.

INTERESTS OF CERTAIN AMERISOURCE DIRECTORS AND EXECUTIVE OFFICERS IN THE MERGER

board of directors and members of AmeriSource's management team have agreements
and arrangements that provide them with interests in the merger that differ
from, or are in addition to, those of AmeriSource shareholders. The AmeriSource
board of directors was aware of these agreements and arrangements during its

                  Yost, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of AmeriSource, and
                  three of whom will be current independent directors of
                  AmeriSource;

         -        each committee of AmeriSource-Bergen will initially be
                  comprised of an equal number of directors designated by each
                  of AmeriSource and Bergen;

         -        R. David Yost, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of
                  AmeriSource, will serve as Chief Executive Officer and

         AmeriSource Employee Stock Options. The board of directors of
AmeriSource will cause all AmeriSource stock options granted prior to February
15, 2001, to the extent not already vested, to vest as of the close of business
on the last business day prior to the merger, and to become exercisable upon the
earlier to occur of their normal vesting date and the first anniversary of the
completion of the merger. As of ________, 2001, which is the record date for the
AmeriSource special meeting, the number of unvested stock options held by
directors and executive officers of AmeriSource totaled _____. Assuming the
merger is completed on ________, 2001, the number of stock options held by
directors and executive officers that would vest on __________, 2001 would total
__________ with an average weighted exercise price of $____.

         If an AmeriSource option holder is terminated following the merger for
cause the exercise period of such employee's options will be as set forth in the
relevant option plan of AmeriSource. In all cases where employment is terminated
following the merger other than for cause, the exercise period of an AmeriSource
option that vested on the last business day prior to the merger, but would not
otherwise have vested until after the first anniversary of the merger, will
terminate as of the later of:

         -        13 months from the completion of the merger; or

         -        the end of the exercise period of such AmeriSource option as
                  set forth in the relevant AmeriSource option plan at the time
                  the merger agreement was executed.

         Prior to the completion of the merger, AmeriSource may grant options to
purchase shares of its common stock so long as:

         -        such grants are made at such times and in such amounts as are
                  consistent with previous grants by AmeriSource in the ordinary
                  course of business; and

         -        such options provide that the consummation of the mergers
                  contemplated by the merger agreement will not be an event
                  which accelerates the vesting of such options.

         Pursuant to the terms of the merger agreement, each AmeriSource stock
option outstanding immediately prior to the merger will be converted upon
completion of the merger into an option to purchase, on the same terms and
conditions, an identical number of shares of AmeriSource-Bergen common stock at
an exercise price per share equal to the exercise price per share of AmeriSource
common stock subject to the option before the conversion.

         Indemnification and Insurance. The merger agreement provides that, upon
completion of the merger, AmeriSource-Bergen will indemnify and hold harmless
and provide advancement of expenses to all past and present directors, officers
and employees of AmeriSource and its subsidiaries, in all of their capacities:

         -        to the same extent they were indemnified or had the right to
                  advancement of expenses as of March 16, 2001, which is the
                  date of the merger agreement, pursuant to AmeriSource's
                  restated

                  certificate of incorporation, bylaws and indemnification
                  agreements with any directors, officers and employees of
                  AmeriSource and its subsidiaries; and

         -        to the fullest extent permitted by law,

in each case for acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the completion of
the merger.

         The merger agreement also provides that, upon completion of the merger,
AmeriSource-Bergen will cause to be maintained, for a period of six years after
completion of the merger, the current policies of directors' and officers'
liability insurance and fiduciary liability insurance maintained by AmeriSource,
or policies of at least the same coverage and amounts containing terms and
conditions which are, in the aggregate, no less advantageous to the insured,
with respect to claims arising from facts or events that occurred on or before
the completion of the merger, although AmeriSource-Bergen will not be required
to expend in any one year an amount in excess of $1,500,000 for the annual
premiums for such directors' and officers' liability insurance and fiduciary
liability insurance. If the annual premiums of such insurance coverage exceed
such amount, AmeriSource-Bergen will obtain a policy with the greatest coverage
available for a cost not exceeding such amount.

         Severance Payments Following the Merger. AmeriSource has agreed to pay
George L. James III, Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of AmeriSource,
a payment equal to three times his base salary upon termination of employment by
the company without cause or by Mr. James for good reason after consummation of
the merger and under certain other circumstances prior to the consummation of
the merger. Such payment would be approximately $840,000.

         Management's Stock Ownership. AmeriSource directors and executive
officers beneficially owned, as of _____, 2001, the record date for the
AmeriSource special meeting, approximately [ %] of the outstanding AmeriSource
Class A common stock, including AmeriSource Class A common stock options. In

         Prior to the completion of the merger, Bergen may grant options to
purchase shares of its common stock so long as:

         -        such grants are made at such times and in such amounts as are

COMPLETION AND EFFECTIVENESS OF THE MERGER

         The merger will be completed when all of the conditions to completion
of the merger are satisfied or waived, including the approval and adoption of
the merger agreement by the shareholders of AmeriSource and Bergen. The merger
will become effective upon the filing of certificates of merger with the
Secretary of State of the State of Delaware and the Department of the Treasury
of the State of New Jersey.

         We are working toward completing the merger as quickly as possible. We
expect to complete the merger during the third quarter of calendar year of 2001.

STRUCTURE OF THE MERGER AND CONVERSION OF AMERISOURCE AND BERGEN STOCK

         Structure. To accomplish the combination of their businesses,
AmeriSource and Bergen jointly formed a new company, AmeriSource-Bergen
(formerly named AABB Corporation), with two subsidiaries, A-Sub Acquisition
Corp. and B-Sub Acquisition Corp. At the effective time of the merger:

         -        A-Sub Acquisition Corp. will be merged with and into
                  AmeriSource, and AmeriSource will be the surviving
                  corporation; and

         -        B-Sub Acquisition Corp. will be merged with and into Bergen,
                  and Bergen will be the surviving corporation.

As a result, AmeriSource and Bergen will each become a wholly owned subsidiary
of AmeriSource-Bergen.

         Conversion of AmeriSource and Bergen Stock. When the merger is
completed:

         -        AmeriSource common shareholders will receive one share of
                  AmeriSource-Bergen common stock for each share they own; and

         -        Bergen common shareholders will receive 0.37 of a share of
                  AmeriSource-Bergen common stock for each share they own.

         The number of shares of AmeriSource-Bergen stock issuable in the merger
will be proportionately adjusted for any stock split, stock dividend or similar
event with respect to the AmeriSource common stock or Bergen common stock
effected between the date of the merger agreement and the date of completion of
the merger.

         In the event that either outside legal counsel of AmeriSource or
outside legal counsel of Bergen is unable to render an opinion that neither
AmeriSource or Bergen, as the case may be, nor the AmeriSource shareholders or
Bergen shareholders, as the case may be, will recognize any gain or loss for
federal income tax purposes in connection with the merger, except for taxes
payable because of the reimbursement of conveyance taxes or conveyance fees, and
in the case of Bergen shareholders, because of cash received instead of
fractional shares, we may amend the merger agreement to provide for the
simultaneous merger of AmeriSource and Bergen with and into AmeriSource-Bergen,
with AmeriSource-Bergen as the surviving corporation in each merger.

EXCHANGE OF STOCK CERTIFICATES FOR AMERISOURCE-BERGEN STOCK CERTIFICATES

         When the merger is completed, the exchange agent will mail to you a
letter of transmittal and instructions for use in surrendering your AmeriSource
or Bergen stock certificates in exchange for AmeriSource-Bergen stock
certificates. When you deliver your stock certificates to the exchange agent
along with a properly executed letter of transmittal and any other required
documents, your stock certificates will be canceled and you will receive
AmeriSource-Bergen stock certificates representing the number of full shares of
AmeriSource-Bergen stock to which you are entitled under the merger agreement.
Bergen shareholders will receive payment in cash, without interest, in lieu of
any fractional shares of AmeriSource-Bergen common stock which would have been
otherwise issuable to them as a result of the merger.

         You should not submit your AmeriSource or Bergen stock certificates for
exchange until you receive the transmittal instructions and a form of letter of
transmittal from the exchange agent.

         You are not entitled to receive any dividends or other distributions on
AmeriSource-Bergen common stock until the merger is completed and you have
surrendered your AmeriSource or Bergen stock certificates in exchange for
AmeriSource-Bergen stock certificates.

         If there is any dividend or other distribution on AmeriSource-Bergen
stock with a record date after the date on which the merger is completed and a
payment date prior to the date you surrender your AmeriSource or Bergen stock
certificates in exchange for AmeriSource-Bergen stock certificates, you will
receive the dividend or distribution with respect to the whole shares of
AmeriSource-Bergen stock issued to you promptly after they are issued. If there
is any dividend or other distribution on AmeriSource-Bergen stock with a record
date after the date on which the merger is completed and a payment date after
the date you surrender your AmeriSource or Bergen stock certificates in exchange
for AmeriSource-Bergen stock certificates, you will receive the dividend or
distribution with respect to the whole shares of AmeriSource-Bergen issued to
you promptly after the payment date.

         AmeriSource-Bergen will only issue an AmeriSource-Bergen stock
certificate or a check in lieu of a fractional share in a name other than the
name in which a surrendered AmeriSource or Bergen stock certificate is
registered if you present the exchange agent with all documents required to show
and effect the unrecorded transfer of ownership and show that you paid any
applicable stock transfer taxes.

TREATMENT OF AMERISOURCE AND BERGEN STOCK OPTIONS

         Each of the boards of directors of AmeriSource and Bergen will cause
all outstanding stock options granted prior to February 15, 2001, under their
respective stock option plans, to vest as of the close of business on the last
business day prior to the merger, and to become exercisable upon the earlier to
occur of their normal vesting date and the first anniversary of the completion
of the merger. If the option holder is terminated following the merger for cause
the exercise period of such employee's options will be as set forth in the
applicable option plan of AmeriSource or Bergen, as the case may be. In all
cases where employment is terminated following the merger other than for cause,
the exercise period of an AmeriSource or Bergen option that vested on the last
business day prior to the merger, but would not otherwise have vested until
after the first anniversary of the merger, will terminate as of the later of:

         -        13 months from the completion of the merger; or

         -        the end of the exercise period of such option as set forth in
                  the AmeriSource option plan (for AmeriSource options) or
                  Bergen option plan (for Bergen options) at the time the merger
                  agreement was executed.

         Prior to the completion of the merger, AmeriSource and Bergen may grant
options to purchase shares of their respective common stock so long as:

         -        such grants are made at such times and in such amounts as are
                  consistent with previous grants by AmeriSource or Bergen in
                  the ordinary course of business; and

         -        such options provide that the consummation of the mergers
                  contemplated by the merger agreement will not be an event
                  which accelerates the vesting of such options.

         AmeriSource-Bergen, AmeriSource and Bergen will cause each outstanding
option granted prior to completion of the merger under stock option plans of
AmeriSource or Bergen to be automatically converted, upon completion of the
merger, into an option to purchase, on the same terms and conditions, that
number of shares of AmeriSource-Bergen common stock

         -        in the case of an AmeriSource option, equal to the identical
                  number of shares of AmeriSource common stock issuable
                  immediately prior to the completion of the merger, upon
                  exercise of the AmeriSource option (without regard to actual
                  restrictions on exercisability), with an exercise price equal
                  to the exercise price under the corresponding AmeriSource
                  option; and

         -        in the case of a Bergen option, equal to the identical number
                  of shares of Bergen common stock issuable immediately prior to
                  the completion of the merger, upon exercise of the Bergen
                  option (without regard to actual restrictions on
                  exercisability), multiplied by 0.37, with an exercise price
                  equal to the exercise price under the corresponding Bergen
                  option divided by 0.37.

         With respect to any Bergen option that is an "incentive stock option",
within the meaning of Section 422 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, the
conversion shall be carried out in a manner satisfying the requirements of
Section 424(a) of the Code.

         In connection with the issuance of AmeriSource-Bergen options,
AmeriSource-Bergen shall

         -        reserve for issuance the number of shares of
                  AmeriSource-Bergen common stock that will become subject to
                  AmeriSource-Bergen options; and

         -        from and after the completion of the merger, upon exercise of
                  AmeriSource-Bergen options, make available for issuance all
                  shares of AmeriSource-Bergen common stock covered by the
                  options.

         AmeriSource and Bergen each agree to issue treasury shares of
AmeriSource or Bergen, to the extent available, upon the exercise of AmeriSource
options or Bergen options prior to the completion of the merger.

         AmeriSource-Bergen agrees to use its reasonable best efforts to file
with the Securities and Exchange Commission within five business days after the
completion of the merger a registration statement on Form S-8 or other
appropriate form under the Securities Act of 1933 to register the shares of
AmeriSource-Bergen common stock issuable upon exercise of the AmeriSource-Bergen
options and use its reasonable best efforts to cause such registration statement
to remain effective until the exercise or expiration of all such options.

EFFECT OF THE MERGER ON OUTSTANDING AMERISOURCE CONVERTIBLE NOTES

         On December 12, 2000, AmeriSource sold $250,000,000 aggregate principal
amount of 5% convertible subordinated notes due December 1, 2007. On December
18, 2000, the underwriters exercised the overallotment option on the notes due
in 2007. As a result, AmeriSource sold additional notes with an aggregate
principal amount of $50,000,000.

         The convertible notes due in 2007 were issued under an indenture dated
as of December 6, 2000 between AmeriSource, AmeriSource Corporation, a
wholly-owned subsidiary of AmeriSource, and Bank One Trust Company, N.A., as
trustee. Upon consummation of the merger, AmeriSource-Bergen will enter into a
supplemental indenture providing that, subject to the terms and conditions of
the indenture, each note will thereafter be convertible into the number of
shares of AmeriSource-Bergen common stock which the note holder would have
received in the merger if the note holder had converted the note immediately
prior to the merger.

MATERIAL UNITED STATES FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSEQUENCES OF THE MERGER

         The following summary discusses the material U.S. federal income tax
consequences of the merger to U.S. Holders of AmeriSource and Bergen stock.

         For purposes of this discussion, a U.S. Holder means:

         -        a citizen or resident of the United States;

         -        a corporation or other entity taxable as a corporation created
                  or organized under the laws of the United States or any of its
                  political subdivisions;

         -        a trust, if a U.S. court is able to exercise primary
                  supervision over the administration of the trust and one or
                  more U.S. persons have the authority to control all
                  substantial decisions of the trust; or

         -        an estate that is subject to U.S. federal income tax on its
                  income regardless of its source.

         This discussion is based upon the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as
amended, Treasury regulations, administrative rulings and judicial decisions
currently in effect, all of which are subject to change, possibly with
retroactive effect. The discussion assumes that AmeriSource shareholders hold
their AmeriSource common stock and will hold their AmeriSource-Bergen common
stock, and that Bergen shareholders hold their Bergen common stock and will hold
their AmeriSource-Bergen common stock, as a capital asset within the meaning of
Section 1221 of the Internal Revenue Code. Further, the discussion does not
address all aspects of U.S. federal income taxation that may be relevant to a
particular shareholder in light of his, her or its personal investment
circumstances or to shareholders subject to special treatment under the U.S.
federal income tax laws, including:

         -        insurance companies;

         -        tax-exempt organizations;

         -        dealers in securities or foreign currency;

         -        banks or trusts;

         -        persons that hold their AmeriSource common stock or Bergen
                  common stock as part of a straddle, a hedge against currency
                  risk or a constructive sale or conversion transaction;

         -        persons that have a functional currency other than the U.S.
                  dollar;

         -        investors in pass-through entities;

         -        shareholders who acquired their AmeriSource common stock or
                  Bergen common stock through the exercise of options or
                  otherwise as compensation or through a tax-qualified
                  retirement plan; or

         -        holders of options granted under any AmeriSource or Bergen
                  benefit plan.

         If a partnership or other entity treated as a partnership for U.S.
federal income tax purposes holds AmeriSource common stock or Bergen common
stock, the tax treatment of a partner will generally depend upon the status of
the partner and upon the activities of the partnership. Partners of partnerships
holding AmeriSource common stock or Bergen common stock should consult their tax
advisors.

         Furthermore, this discussion does not consider the potential effects of
any state, local or foreign tax laws.

         None of AmeriSource, Bergen or AmeriSource-Bergen has requested a
ruling from the U.S. Internal Revenue Service with respect to any of the U.S.
federal income tax consequences of the merger and, as a result, there can be no
assurance that the Internal Revenue Service will not disagree with or challenge
any of the conclusions described below.

         It is a condition to the closing of the merger that each of AmeriSource
and Bergen receive a tax opinion from its counsel to the effect that, based on
the facts, representations and assumptions set forth in such opinion, the
shareholders of AmeriSource and Bergen will not recognize any gain or loss for
U.S. federal income tax purposes on the exchange of AmeriSource common stock or
Bergen common stock for AmeriSource-Bergen common stock in the merger except to
the extent cash is received in lieu of fractional shares and payments of
shareholders' conveyance taxes or conveyance fees are made by
AmeriSource-Bergen. The opinion from Dechert, counsel to AmeriSource, and the
opinion from Shearman & Sterling, counsel to Bergen, will be based upon
representation letters provided by AmeriSource and Bergen. Neither AmeriSource
nor Bergen knows any reason why they would not be able to deliver their expected
representation letters or why their respective counsel would not be able to
deliver their opinions. Any change in currently applicable law, which may or may
not be retroactive, or failure of any factual representations or assumptions to
be true, correct and complete in all material respects, could affect the ability
of the firms to deliver, or the continuing validity of the Dechert tax opinion
and the Shearman & Sterling tax opinion after delivery.

         Based on such tax opinions to be delivered, the U.S. federal income tax
consequences of the merger would be as follows:

         -        No gain or loss will be recognized by AmeriSource-Bergen,
                  AmeriSource, Bergen, A-Sub Acquisition Corp. or B-Sub
                  Acquisition Corp. in connection with the merger.

         -        No gain or loss will be recognized by: (i) U.S. Holders of
                  AmeriSource common stock on the exchange of their AmeriSource
                  common stock for AmeriSource-Bergen common stock (except to
                  the extent of any payments made by AmeriSource-Bergen on
                  behalf of the U.S. Holders of AmeriSource common stock with
                  respect to any conveyance taxes or conveyance fees which may
                  become payable in connection with the merger) or (ii) U.S.
                  Holders of Bergen common stock on the exchange of their Bergen
                  common stock for AmeriSource-Bergen common stock (except to
                  the extent of cash received by U.S. Holders of Bergen common
                  stock in lieu of fractional shares of AmeriSource-Bergen
                  common stock and to the extent of any payments made by
                  AmeriSource-Bergen on behalf of the U.S. Holders of Bergen
                  common stock with respect to any conveyance taxes or
                  conveyance fees which may become payable in connection with
                  the merger).

         -        The aggregate adjusted basis of the AmeriSource-Bergen common
                  stock received in the merger by a U.S. Holder of AmeriSource
                  common stock will be equal to the aggregate adjusted basis of
                  the U.S. Holder's AmeriSource common stock exchanged for that
                  AmeriSource-Bergen common stock (reduced by any amount
                  allocable to payments of shareholders' conveyance taxes or

                  conveyance fees made by AmeriSource-Bergen and increased by
                  the amount of gain, if any, recognized on account of such
                  payments). The aggregate adjusted basis of the
                  AmeriSource-Bergen common stock received in the merger by a
                  U.S. Holder of Bergen common stock (including any fractional
                  share of AmeriSource-Bergen common stock with respect to which
                  the U.S. Holder receives cash) will be equal to the aggregate
                  adjusted basis of the U.S. Holder's Bergen common stock
                  exchanged for that AmeriSource-Bergen common stock (reduced by
                  any amount allocable to payments of shareholders' conveyance
                  taxes or conveyance fees made by AmeriSource-Bergen and
                  increased by the amount of gain, if any, recognized on account
                  of such payments).

         -        The holding period of the AmeriSource-Bergen common stock
                  received in the merger by a U.S. Holder of AmeriSource common
                  stock will include the holding period of the U.S. Holder's
                  AmeriSource common stock exchanged for that AmeriSource-Bergen
                  common stock. The holding period of the AmeriSource-Bergen
                  common stock received in the merger by a U.S. Holder of Bergen
                  common stock will include the holding period of the U.S.
                  Holder's Bergen common stock exchanged for that
                  AmeriSource-Bergen common stock.

         Cash Instead of Fractional Shares. The receipt of cash instead of a
fractional share of AmeriSource-Bergen common stock by a U.S. Holder of Bergen
common stock will be treated as a taxable disposition of that fractional share
interest and the U.S. Holder will recognize taxable gain or loss for U.S.
federal income tax purposes based upon the difference between the amount of cash
received by such U.S. Holder and the U.S. Holder's adjusted tax basis in the
fractional share. The gain or loss will constitute capital gain or loss and will
constitute long-term capital gain or loss if the U.S. Holder's holding period in
the Bergen common stock surrendered is greater than 12 months as of the date of
the merger. For non-corporate U.S. Holders, long-term capital gain generally
will be subject to tax at a maximum U.S. federal income tax rate of 20%. The
deductibility of capital losses is subject to limitations.

         Payments of Conveyance Taxes or Conveyance Fees. A payment of
conveyance taxes or conveyance fees made by AmeriSource-Bergen on behalf of a
U.S. Holder of AmeriSource or Bergen common stock will be treated as
consideration that is not permitted to be received without the recognition of
gain. An AmeriSource or Bergen shareholder who has payments of shareholders'
conveyance taxes or conveyance fees made by AmeriSource-Bergen and whose
aggregate tax basis for the AmeriSource or Bergen common stock surrendered in
the merger is less than the sum of the fair market value of the
AmeriSource-Bergen common stock received in the merger (in the case of a Bergen
shareholder, including any fractional shares of AmeriSource-Bergen common stock
with respect to which the shareholder receives cash) plus the amount of such
payments of shareholders' conveyance taxes or conveyance fees made by
AmeriSource-Bergen, will recognize gain for U.S. federal income tax purposes in
an amount equal to the lesser of (A) the amount of gain realized and (B) the
amount of payments of shareholders' conveyance taxes or conveyance fees made by
AmeriSource-Bergen. The amount of gain realized will generally be calculated as
the amount by which the sum of the fair market value of the AmeriSource-Bergen
common stock received (in the case of a Bergen shareholder, including any
fractional shares of AmeriSource-Bergen common stock with respect to which the
shareholder receives cash) plus the amount of such payments of shareholders'
conveyance taxes or conveyance fees made by AmeriSource-Bergen exceeds the
aggregate tax basis of the AmeriSource or Bergen stock surrendered. Any gain
that an AmeriSource or Bergen shareholder recognizes should generally be capital
gain, and should be long-term capital gain if the holding period for the
AmeriSource or Bergen common stock surrendered is greater than 12 months as of
the date of the merger. An AmeriSource or Bergen shareholder will not recognize
any loss on account of any payment made by AmeriSource-Bergen on behalf of such
shareholder with respect to any conveyance taxes or conveyance fees.

         Backup Withholding. Certain non-corporate Bergen shareholders may be
subject to backup withholding at a 31% rate on cash payments received instead of
fractional shares of AmeriSource-Bergen common stock. Backup withholding will
not apply, however, to a Bergen shareholder who:

         -        furnishes a correct taxpayer identification number and
                  certifies that he, she or it is not subject to backup
                  withholding on the substitute Form W-9 or successor form
                  included in the letter of

                  transmittal to be delivered to Bergen shareholders following
                  the date of completion of the merger; or

         -        is otherwise exempt from backup withholding.

         Reporting Requirements. A U.S. Holder of AmeriSource common stock or
Bergen common stock receiving AmeriSource-Bergen common stock as a result of the
merger may be required to retain records related to the merger and file with its
federal income tax return a statement setting forth facts relating to the
merger.

         This summary of U.S. federal income tax consequences is intended to
provide only a general summary and is not intended to be a complete analysis or
description of all potential U.S. federal income tax consequences of the merger.
In addition, the summary does not address tax consequences that may vary with,
or depend on, individual circumstances. Moreover, the summary does not address
any U.S. non-income tax or any foreign, state or local tax consequences of the
merger. The summary does not address the tax consequences of any transaction
other than the merger. Accordingly, each AmeriSource and Bergen shareholder is
strongly urged to consult with a tax advisor to determine the particular
federal, state, local or foreign income or other tax consequences of the merger
to the holder.

ACCOUNTING TREATMENT OF THE MERGER

         Since current AmeriSource shareholders will own approximately 51% of
AmeriSource-Bergen's common stock immediately after the merger (with current
Bergen shareholders owning the remaining approximately 49% of AmeriSource-Bergen
common stock), AmeriSource-Bergen will account for the merger as an acquisition
by AmeriSource of Bergen. The merger is intended to qualify as a purchase
transaction for accounting and financial reporting purposes as contemplated by
the Exposure Draft of the proposed Statement entitled Business Combinations and
Intangible Assets-Accounting for Goodwill, dated February 14, 2001.

         Under current accounting and financial reporting rules, AmeriSource-
Bergen will have to:

         -        account for the merger as an acquisition by AmeriSource of
                  Bergen;

         -        treat the value of Bergen as indicated by the fair value of
                  AmeriSource-Bergen stock issued to acquire the stock of Bergen
                  (i.e., the purchase price);

         -        record acquired tangible assets, intangible assets and
                  obligations at their fair value; and

         -        recognize goodwill as an asset and amortize such goodwill
                  against earnings (goodwill is the excess of the purchase price
                  over the fair value of Bergen's net assets). The goodwill will
                  be allocated to one or more reporting units.

         Amortization of any existing goodwill on the balance sheet will cease
if and when the standard set by the Exposure Draft of the proposed Statement
entitled Business Combinations and Intangible Assets-Accounting for Goodwill,
dated February 14, 2001 is adopted and becomes effective, and the goodwill that
is recognized as a result of a merger will not be amortized. Instead, subsequent
to the merger, goodwill would be subjected to an impairment test when an event
occurs indicating goodwill of a reporting unit might be impaired. To the extent
that the goodwill is impaired, its carrying amount would be written down to its
fair value and an impairment charge made to earnings. Consummation of the merger
is conditioned on the Financial Accounting Standards Board promulgating a final
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards providing for accounting treatment
of the merger and the other related transactions in all material respects as in
the Exposure Draft of the proposed Statement entitled Business Combinations and
Intangible Assets-Accounting for Goodwill, dated February 14, 2001. See "The
Merger - The Merger Agreement - Conditions to Completion of the Merger." As of
May 16, 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board has not publicly
pronounced any changes or any intention to make changes which would provide for
accounting treatment for the non-amortization of goodwill different from the
Exposure Draft of the proposed Statement.

REGULATORY MATTERS

         We have summarized below the material regulatory requirements affecting
the merger. Although we have not yet received the required approvals we discuss,
we anticipate that we will receive regulatory approvals sufficient to complete
the merger during the third quarter of 2001.

         Antitrust Considerations. The merger is subject to the requirements of
the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended, which
prevents specified transactions from being completed until required information
and materials are furnished to the Antitrust Division of the Department of
Justice and the Federal Trade Commission and specified waiting periods are
terminated or expire. On April 6, 2001, we filed the required information and
materials to notify the Department of Justice and the Federal Trade Commission
of the merger. On May 7, 2001, the Federal Trade Commission issued a request for
additional information. The waiting period under the Hart Scott Rodino Antitrust
Improvements Act of 1976, as amended, has been extended until 30 days after
AmeriSource and Bergen have substantially complied with such request.

         The Antitrust Division and the Federal Trade Commission frequently
scrutinize the legality under the antitrust laws of transactions such as the
merger. At any time before or after the consummation of the merger, the
Antitrust Division or the Federal Trade Commission could take such action under
the antitrust laws as it deems necessary or desirable in the public interest,
including seeking to enjoin the consummation of the merger or seeking the
divestiture of assets of AmeriSource or Bergen. AmeriSource and Bergen believe
that the consummation of the merger will not violate antitrust laws. There can
be no assurance, however, that a challenge to the merger on antitrust grounds
will not be made, or, if such a challenge is made, what the result will be.

         AmeriSource and Bergen expect that the merger will not generally
require filings, approvals or clearances with foreign antitrust regulatory
authorities under foreign antitrust laws.

         Other than as described in this joint proxy statement-prospectus, the
merger does not require the approval of any federal, state or foreign agency. We
will, however, be required to make certain filings with state and federal
governmental authorities in connection with the merger.

RESTRICTIONS ON SALES OF SHARES BY AFFILIATES OF AMERISOURCE AND BERGEN

         The shares of AmeriSource-Bergen common stock to be issued in
connection with the merger will be registered under the Securities Act of 1933
and will be freely transferable under the Securities Act, except for shares of
AmeriSource-Bergen common stock issued to any person who is deemed to be an
"affiliate" of either AmeriSource or Bergen at the time of the special meetings.
Persons who may be deemed to be affiliates include individuals or entities that
control, are controlled by, or are under the common control of either
AmeriSource or Bergen and may include our executive officers and directors, as
well as our significant shareholders. Affiliates may not sell their shares of
AmeriSource-Bergen common stock acquired in connection with the merger except
pursuant to:

         -        an effective registration statement under the Securities Act
                  covering the resale of those shares;

         -        an exemption under paragraph (d) of Rule 145 under the
                  Securities Act; or

         -        any other applicable exemption under the Securities Act.

         AmeriSource-Bergen's registration statement on Form S-4, of which this
joint proxy statement-prospectus forms a part, does not cover the resale of
shares of AmeriSource-Bergen common stock to be received by our affiliates in
the merger.

NEW YORK STOCK EXCHANGE LISTING OF AMERISOURCE-BERGEN COMMON STOCK TO BE ISSUED
IN THE MERGER

         AmeriSource-Bergen will use reasonable best efforts to cause the shares
of AmeriSource-Bergen common stock to be issued in connection with the merger to
be approved for listing on the New York Stock Exchange,

subject to official notice of issuance, before the completion of the merger.
Such approval is a condition to the merger.

APPRAISAL RIGHTS

         Under Delaware law, AmeriSource shareholders are not entitled to
appraisal rights in connection with the merger. Under New Jersey law, Bergen
shareholders are not entitled to appraisal rights in connection with the merger.

DELISTING AND DEREGISTRATION OF AMERISOURCE AND BERGEN COMMON STOCK AFTER THE
MERGER

         When the merger is completed, AmeriSource Class A common stock and
Bergen common stock will each be delisted from the New York Stock Exchange and
will be deregistered under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.

THE MERGER AGREEMENT

         The following summary of the merger agreement is qualified in its
entirety by reference to the complete text of the merger agreement, which is
incorporated by reference and attached as Annex A to this joint proxy
statement-prospectus. We urge you to read the full text of the merger agreement.

         Completion of the Merger. The merger will be completed when AmeriSource
files a certificate of merger with the Delaware Secretary of State and Bergen
files a certificate of merger with the New Jersey Department of the Treasury.
However, AmeriSource and Bergen may agree to a later time for completion of the
merger and specify that time in the certificates of merger. AmeriSource and
Bergen will file the certificates of merger as soon as practicable after the
satisfaction or waiver of the closing conditions in the merger agreement, which
are described below.

         The parties expect to complete the merger during the third quarter of
calendar year 2001.

         Conditions to Completion of the Merger. Each of AmeriSource's and
Bergen's obligations to complete the merger are subject to the satisfaction or
waiver of specified conditions before completion of the merger, including the
following:

         -        the approval and adoption of the merger agreement by:

                  -        a majority of the votes cast at the special meeting
                           (assuming a quorum is present in person or by proxy)
                           by the holders of a majority of the outstanding
                           shares of Bergen common stock and

                  -        the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares
                           of AmeriSource Class A common stock;

         -        the expiration or termination of any applicable waiting
                  periods under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act

         -        the absence of any law, order or injunction prohibiting
                  completion of the merger;

         -        the absence of any action by any governmental authority
                  challenging the merger or seeking to limit the ownership or
                  operation of AmeriSource, Bergen or their subsidiaries before
                  or after the merger;

         -        the declaration of effectiveness of the registration statement
                  on Form S-4, of which this joint proxy statement-prospectus
                  forms a part, by the Securities and Exchange Commission, and
                  the absence of any stop order or threatened or pending
                  proceedings seeking a stop order;

         -        the approval for listing on the New York Stock Exchange of the

         -        the promulgation by the Financial Accounting Standards Board
                  of a final Statement of Financial Accounting Standards which

                  material respects as in the Exposure Draft of the proposed
                  Statement entitled Business Combinations and Intangible Assets
                  - Accounting for Goodwill, dated February 14, 2001.

         AmeriSource's obligation to complete the merger is subject to the
satisfaction or waiver of the following additional conditions before completion
of the merger:

         -        Bergen's representations and warranties, disregarding all
                  qualifications and exceptions contained in the merger
                  agreement relating to materiality or material adverse effect,
                  must be true and correct as of the date of the merger
                  agreement and as of the date of completion of the merger,
                  except for:

                  -        representations and warranties that expressly address
                           matters only as of a particular date, which must be
                           true and correct as of such date; and

                  -        any failure of such representations and warranties to
                           be true and correct that would not, individually or
                           in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a
                           material adverse effect on Bergen;

         -        Bergen must have performed in all material respects each
                  obligation and agreement and must have complied in all
                  material respects with each covenant to be performed and
                  complied with by it prior to the merger, except for breaches
                  relating to the conduct of Bergen's operations which, in the
                  aggregate, do not have a material adverse effect on Bergen;
                  and

         -        AmeriSource must have received an opinion from Dechert that
                  neither AmeriSource nor the AmeriSource shareholders will
                  recognize any gain or loss for federal income tax purposes in
                  connection with the merger, except to the extent that cash may
                  be received in lieu of fractional shares and to the extent of
                  any payment of conveyance taxes.

         Bergen's obligation to complete the merger is subject to the
satisfaction or waiver of the following additional conditions before completion
of the merger:

         -        AmeriSource's representations and warranties, disregarding all
                  qualifications and exceptions contained in the merger
                  agreement relating to materiality or material adverse effect,
                  must be true and correct as of the date of the merger
                  agreement and as of the date of completion of the merger,
                  except for:

                  -        representations and warranties that expressly address
                           matters only as of a particular date, which must be
                           true and correct as of such date; and

                  -        any failure of such representations and warranties to
                           be true and correct that would not, individually or
                           in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a
                           material adverse effect on AmeriSource.

         -        AmeriSource must have performed in all material respects each
                  obligation and agreement and must have complied in all
                  material respects with each covenant to be performed and
                  complied with by it prior to the merger, except for breaches
                  relating to the conduct of AmeriSource's operations which, in
                  the aggregate, do not have a material adverse effect on
                  AmeriSource; and

         -        Bergen must have received an opinion from Shearman & Sterling
                  that neither Bergen nor the Bergen shareholders will recognize
                  any gain or loss for federal income tax purposes in connection
                  with the merger, except to the extent that cash may be
                  received in lieu of fractional shares and to the extent of any
                  payment of conveyance taxes.

         For purposes of the merger agreement, a "material adverse effect" with
respect to any party is deemed to occur if any event, change or effect,
individually or in the aggregate with other such events, changes or effects,
exists or has occurred which would reasonably be expected to have a material
adverse effect on the business, assets,

results of operations or financial condition of the party and its subsidiaries
taken as a whole. However, there will be no material adverse effect with respect
to any party to the extent that any change in or effect upon the business,
assets, results of operations or financial condition of such party or any of its
subsidiaries that directly or indirectly arises out of or is attributable to:

         -        any decrease in the market price of the shares of AmeriSource
                  Class A common stock (in the case of AmeriSource) or Bergen
                  common stock (in the case of Bergen) (but not any event,
                  change or effect underlying the decrease to the extent such
                  event, change or effect would otherwise constitute a material
                  adverse effect on such party);

         -        conditions, events, or circumstances generally affecting the
                  economy as a whole or the pharmaceutical wholesaling industry
                  generally;

         -        the loss by a party and its subsidiaries of any customer
                  (including business of a customer and any financial
                  consequence of the loss of a customer) to the other party; or

         -        the announcement of the merger and the other transactions
                  contemplated by the merger agreement.

         No Solicitations of Alternative Transactions. The merger agreement
contains detailed provisions prohibiting AmeriSource and Bergen from seeking an
alternative transaction to the merger. Under these "no solicitation" provisions,
each of AmeriSource and Bergen has agreed that it will not, and will not
authorize or permit any of its subsidiaries or any of its subsidiaries' or its
directors, officers, employees, agents and representatives, directly or
indirectly, to:

         -        solicit, initiate, encourage or facilitate, or furnish or
                  disclose any information in furtherance of, any inquiries or
                  the making of any competing transaction, as described below;

         -        negotiate or otherwise engage in discussions with any person
                  with respect to any competing transaction; or

         -        enter into any agreement, arrangement or understanding
                  requiring it to abandon, terminate or fail to consummate the
                  merger or any other transactions contemplated by the merger
                  agreement.

For purposes of the merger agreement, the term "competing transaction" means,
with respect to either party:

         -        any recapitalization, merger, consolidation or other business
                  combination;

         -        the acquisition of any capital stock from the party (other
                  than pursuant to permitted employee stock options or upon the
                  conversion of the AmeriSource convertible notes);

         -        the acquisition of 15% or more of the assets of the party and
                  its subsidiaries, taken as a whole, in a single transaction or
                  a series of related transactions; or

         -        any acquisition by the party of any material assets or capital
                  stock of any other person (other than inventory in the
                  ordinary course of business or acquisitions valued at less
                  than $100 million in the aggregate that would not materially
                  and adversely affect the ability of the parties to satisfy
                  conditions to the merger relating to antitrust laws or the
                  timing of the satisfaction of such conditions).

         However, prior to approval by a party's shareholders, the merger
agreement does not prevent each of AmeriSource and Bergen, or the board of
directors of each of AmeriSource and Bergen, from furnishing information to, and
negotiating or otherwise engaging in discussions with, any party who delivers a
written proposal for a competing transaction which was not solicited or
encouraged after the date of the merger agreement if and so long as:

         -        the board of directors of the party receiving the proposal
                  determines in good faith by a majority vote, after
                  consultation with its outside legal counsel, that failing to
                  take such action would constitute a breach of fiduciary duty
                  under applicable law;

         -        the board of directors of the party receiving the proposal
                  determines, after consulting with its financial advisor, that
                  the proposal is more favorable to its shareholders from a
                  financial point of view than the merger (including any
                  adjustment to the terms and conditions proposed by the other
                  party in response to the competing transaction);

         -        the board of directors of the party receiving the proposal
                  determines that it is reasonably likely to be consummated
                  after taking into consideration all the terms and conditions
                  of the proposal (including the availability of financing, the
                  conditions to consummation and the likelihood of objections
                  under antitrust laws); and

         -        prior to furnishing information, or entering into negotiations
                  or discussions, the party receiving the proposal for a
                  competing transaction uses its reasonable best efforts to
                  execute a confidentiality agreement on terms no less favorable
                  than those contained in the confidentiality agreement between
                  AmeriSource and Bergen.

         In addition, the board of directors of either AmeriSource or Bergen
may, prior to approval by their shareholders, withdraw, modify or change, in a
manner adverse to the other party, its recommendation of the merger, take and
disclose to shareholders a position with respect to a competing transaction and
comply with Rule 14e-2 promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as
amended, with respect to a competing transaction by disclosing such change in
board recommendation in connection with a tender or exchange offer if:

         -        the board of directors of the party that is changing its
                  recommendation determines in good faith by a majority vote,
                  after consultation with its outside legal counsel, that
                  failure to do so would constitute a breach of fiduciary duty
                  under applicable law; and

         -        the party that is changing its recommendation uses its
                  reasonable best efforts to give the other party two days prior
                  written notice of its intention to do so.

         The board of directors of each of AmeriSource and Bergen agreed that
they will not, in connection with any change in recommendation, take any action
to change the approval of the board of directors for purposes of causing any
state takeover statute or other state law or the applicable shareholder's rights
agreement to be applicable to the transactions contemplated by the merger
agreement, including the stock option agreements, the support/voting agreements
and the merger. In addition, each party agreed that, notwithstanding any change
in recommendation by its board of directors, it will submit the merger agreement
to its shareholders for the purpose of obtaining the approval and adoption of
the merger agreement and the transactions contemplated in the merger agreement
and nothing in the "no solicitation" provisions of the merger agreement relieves
a party of that obligation.

         If the board of directors of either AmeriSource or Bergen makes a
change in recommendation, the other party may terminate the merger agreement and
the party making the change in recommendation may owe a termination fee to the
terminating party, as described below under "Termination Fee."

         Each of AmeriSource and Bergen have agreed, as of the date of the
merger agreement, to:

         -        cease all existing activities, discussions and negotiations
                  with any parties with respect to any proposal for a competing
                  transaction; and

         -        immediately advise the other party in writing of the receipt,
                  directly or indirectly, of any inquiries, discussions,
                  negotiations, or proposals relating to a competing transaction
                  (including the specific terms thereof and the identity of the
                  third party or parties involved) and furnish to the other
                  party, as promptly as practicable, and in any event within two
                  days of receipt, an accurate description of all material terms
                  (including any changes or adjustments to such terms as a
                  result of negotiations or otherwise) of any written proposal
                  in addition to any information provided to any third party
                  relating to such proposal.

         Termination. The merger agreement may be terminated at any time prior
to the completion of the merger, whether before or after the shareholder
approvals have been obtained:

         -        by mutual written consent duly authorized by the board of
                  directors of AmeriSource and Bergen;

         -        by either AmeriSource or Bergen if the merger is not completed
                  on or before September 15, 2001; except that this right to
                  terminate the merger agreement will not be available to any
                  party whose failure or whose affiliate's failure to perform
                  any material covenant or obligation under the merger agreement
                  has been the cause of or resulted in the failure of the merger
                  to be completed by September 15, 2001;

         -        by either AmeriSource or Bergen if at a meeting of
                  shareholders the approval of either party's shareholders is
                  not obtained because of the failure to obtain the required
                  vote to approve and adopt the merger agreement;

         -        by AmeriSource or Bergen if the other party materially
                  breaches any of its representations, warranties, covenants or
                  agreements contained in the merger agreement and the breach
                  would result in the failure to satisfy one or more of the
                  conditions to the completion of the merger relating to the
                  accuracy of representations and warranties and the performance
                  of or compliance with agreements and covenants and, if the
                  breach by its nature can be cured, the breach is not cured
                  within 30 days after notice is received by the party alleged
                  to be in breach;

         -        by AmeriSource if Bergen breaches in any material respect any
                  of its obligations under the Bergen stock option agreement;

         -        by Bergen if AmeriSource breaches in any material respect any
                  of its obligations under the AmeriSource stock option
                  agreement;

         -        by Bergen if:

                  -        the board of directors of AmeriSource withdraws, or
                           modifies or changes in any respect materially adverse
                           to Bergen, its recommendation of the merger agreement
                           or the transactions contemplated by the merger
                           agreement or resolved to do so;

                  -        the board of directors of AmeriSource recommends to
                           the shareholders of AmeriSource a competing
                           transaction or resolves to do so; or

                  -        a tender offer or exchange offer for 15% or more of
                           the outstanding shares of capital stock of
                           AmeriSource is commenced, and the board of directors
                           of AmeriSource fails, within ten business days, to
                           recommend against acceptance of the tender offer or
                           exchange offer by its shareholders (including by
                           taking no position with respect to the acceptance of
                           the tender offer or exchange offer by its
                           shareholders); or

         -        by AmeriSource if:

                  -        the board of directors of Bergen withdraws, or
                           modifies or changes in any respect materially adverse
                           to AmeriSource, its recommendation of the merger
                           agreement or the transactions contemplated by the
                           merger agreement or resolves to do so;

                  -        the board of directors of Bergen recommends to the
                           shareholders of Bergen a competing transaction or
                           resolves to do so; or

                  -        a tender offer or exchange offer for 15% or more of
                           the outstanding shares of capital stock of Bergen is
                           commenced, and the board of directors of Bergen
                           fails, within ten business days, to recommend against
                           acceptance of the tender offer or exchange offer by
                           its shareholders (including by taking no position
                           with respect to the acceptance of the tender offer or
                           exchange offer by its shareholders).

         Termination Fees and Expenses. Whether or not the merger is completed
and except as described below, all expenses incurred in connection with the
merger agreement and the merger will be paid by the party incurring the
expenses, except that AmeriSource and Bergen each will pay one-half of all
expenses relating to:

         -        the filing of any required notices under the Hart-Scott-Rodino
                  Act or other similar regulations;

         -        the printing, filing and mailing of the registration statement
                  and this joint proxy statement-prospectus and all Securities
                  Exchange Commission and other regulatory filing fees incurred
                  in connection with the registration statement and this joint
                  proxy statement-prospectus; and

         -        the fees and expenses of economic and accounting experts or
                  consultants hired in connection with resolving any
                  investigation or other inquiry relating to antitrust laws.

         The merger agreement provides that Bergen may be required to pay a
termination fee to AmeriSource equal to $75 million, together with expenses not
to exceed $15 million, in the following circumstances:

         -        AmeriSource terminates the merger agreement due to a
                  withdrawal of or change in the recommendation of the merger
                  agreement, a recommendation of a Bergen competing transaction
                  or the failure to recommend against a competing tender or
                  exchange offer by the board of directors of Bergen, each as
                  described above under "Termination," and at the time of
                  termination there exists or has been publicly announced a
                  proposal for a Bergen competing transaction;

         -        either party terminates the merger agreement due to the
                  failure of Bergen's shareholders to approve and adopt the
                  merger agreement and at the time of such failure to approve
                  and adopt the merger agreement there exists or has been
                  publicly announced a proposal for a Bergen competing
                  transaction; or

         -        either party terminates the merger agreement due to the
                  failure of the merger to be completed by September 15, 2001,
                  at the time of termination there exists or has been publicly
                  announced a proposal for a Bergen competing transaction and
                  within nine months of termination Bergen consummates a Bergen
                  competing transaction (other than a Bergen competing
                  transaction that consists of the acquisition of capital stock
                  from Bergen representing less than 15% of the then outstanding
                  Bergen common stock on a fully-diluted basis or the
                  acquisition by Bergen of assets or capital stock of another
                  person so long as the acquisition would not result in such
                  person (or the shareholders of such person) beneficially
                  owning securities representing more than 35% of the capital
                  stock of Bergen).

         The merger agreement also provides that AmeriSource may be required to
pay a termination fee to Bergen equal to $75 million, together with expenses not
to exceed $15 million, in the following circumstances:

         -        Bergen terminates the merger agreement due to a withdrawal of
                  or change in the recommendation of the merger agreement, a
                  recommendation of an AmeriSource competing transaction or the
                  failure to recommend against a competing tender or exchange
                  offer by the board of directors of AmeriSource, each as
                  described above under "Termination," and at the time of
                  termination there exists or has been publicly announced a
                  proposal for an AmeriSource competing transaction;

         -        either party terminates the merger agreement due to the
                  failure of AmeriSource's shareholders to approve and adopt the
                  merger agreement and at the time of such failure to approve
                  and adopt the merger agreement there exists or has been
                  publicly announced a proposal for an AmeriSource competing
                  transaction; or

         -        either party terminates the merger agreement due to the
                  failure of the merger to be completed by September 15, 2001,
                  at the time of termination there exists or has been publicly
                  announced a proposal for an AmeriSource competing transaction
                  and within nine months of termination AmeriSource consummates
                  an AmeriSource competing transaction (other than an
                  AmeriSource competing transaction that consists of the
                  acquisition of capital stock from AmeriSource representing
                  less than 15% of the then outstanding AmeriSource Class A
                  common stock on a fully-diluted basis or the acquisition by
                  AmeriSource of assets or capital stock of another person so
                  long as the acquisition would not result in such person (or
                  the shareholders of such person) beneficially owning
                  securities representing more than 35% of the capital stock of
                  AmeriSource).

         In the merger agreement, AmeriSource and Bergen also agreed to pay all
of the other party's expenses, up to a maximum of $10 million, if the other
party terminates the merger agreement due to a material breach of the paying
party's representations, warranties, covenants or agreements contained in the
merger agreement.

         Conduct of Business Pending the Merger. Each of AmeriSource and Bergen
has agreed that, during the period before completion of the merger, it will
conduct its operations in the ordinary course except as expressly contemplated
by the merger agreement and the transactions contemplated by the merger
agreement and will use its reasonable best efforts to maintain and preserve its
business organization and to retain the services of its officers and key
employees and maintain relationships with customers, suppliers, lessees,
licensees and other third parties to the end that its goodwill and ongoing
business will not be impaired in any material respect. In addition to the
agreements regarding the conduct of business generally, each of AmeriSource and
Bergen has agreed to various specific restrictions relating to the conduct of
business, including the following (in each case except as otherwise expressly
contemplated in the merger agreement or by the transactions contemplated by the
merger agreement or pursuant to the prior written consent of the other party,

         -        the redemption, repurchase or other acquisition of any shares
                  of its capital stock or any securities or obligations

                  stock;

         -        the issuance, delivery or sale, or any agreement to issue,
                  deliver or sell, any shares of its capital stock or any other
                  securities or obligations convertible into or exchangeable or
                  exercisable for any shares of its capital stock or such
                  securities (except pursuant to the exercise of permitted
                  options);

         -        entering into any agreement, understanding or arrangement with
                  respect to the sale, voting, registration or repurchase of its
                  capital stock;

                  effect to assumed indebtedness, at more than $100 million in
                  the aggregate or that would materially and adversely affect
                  the ability of the parties to satisfy conditions to the merger
                  relating to antitrust laws or the timing of the satisfaction
                  of such conditions;

         -        except pursuant to existing credit arrangements, in connection
                  with certain refinancings of bank debt, or in the ordinary

         -        making any material tax election (unless required by law or
                  consistent with prior practice) or, unless the other party is
                  given reasonable prior written notice, settling any material
                  tax liability;

         -        modifying, amending or terminating, or waiving, releasing or

                  consistent with past practices and which, individually or in
                  the aggregate, would not be reasonably expected to have a
                  material adverse effect;

         -        entrance into any standstill or non-compete agreements or
                  arrangements which after the merger would apply or purport to

         -        incurring or committing to any capital expenditures,

         -        except as permitted by the merger agreement, taking any action
                  to make any person exempt or not subject to any state takeover
                  law or state law that limits or restricts business
                  combinations or the ability to acquire or vote shares;

                  confidentiality agreement or standstill agreement;

         -        the taking of any action that will likely result in the
                  party's representations and warranties in the merger agreement
                  becoming false or inaccurate in any material respect;

         -        entering into or carrying out any other transaction other than
                  in the ordinary and usual course of business or other than as
                  permitted pursuant to the merger agreement;

         -        agreeing in writing or otherwise to take any of the actions

         Antitrust Matters. Each of AmeriSource and Bergen has agreed that:

         -        it will make or cause to be made the filings required of it or
                  any of its subsidiaries or affiliates under the
                  Hart-Scott-Rodino Act with respect to the transactions
                  contemplated by the merger agreement as promptly as
                  practicable;

         -        it will comply at the earliest practicable date with any
                  request under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act for additional
                  information, documents, or other materials received from the
                  Federal Trade Commission or the Department of Justice or any
                  other governmental authority;

         -        it will cooperate with the other party in connection with any
                  filing under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act (including by providing
                  copies of all documents to the nonfiling party's outside
                  counsel) and in connection with resolving any investigation or
                  other inquiry of any such agency or other governmental
                  authority under any antitrust laws;

         -        it will use its best efforts to resolve objections asserted by
                  any governmental authority under antitrust laws; and

         -        it will use its best efforts to take such action as may be
                  required to cause the waiting period under the
                  Hart-Scott-Rodino Act or other antitrust laws to expire or be
                  terminated as promptly as possible.

         Additional Agreements. Each of AmeriSource and Bergen has agreed that,
except as otherwise provided in the merger agreement and subject to its legal
obligations, it will use its reasonable best efforts to fulfill all conditions
precedent specified in the merger agreement, to the extent that such conditions
are within its control, and to do all things reasonably necessary to consummate
the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement. Each of AmeriSource and
Bergen has agreed to use its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be
taken, all actions, and to do, or cause to be done, and to assist and cooperate
with the other parties in doing, all things necessary, proper or advisable to
complete the merger in the most expeditious manner practicable, including:

         -        the obtaining of all necessary actions or consents from
                  governmental authorities and the making of all necessary
                  registrations and filings; and

         -        the obtaining of all consents, approvals or waivers from third
                  parties related to or required in connection with the merger
                  that are necessary to consummate the merger or required to
                  prevent a material adverse effect on AmeriSource, Bergen or
                  AmeriSource-Bergen from occurring prior to or after the
                  merger.

         The merger agreement also contains covenants relating to the
cooperation between AmeriSource and Bergen in the preparation of this joint
proxy statement-prospectus and additional agreements between them relating to,
among other things, tax-free treatment, public announcements, indemnification of
directors and officers, listing on the New York Stock Exchange, conveyance taxes
and an AmeriSource-Bergen rights agreement.

         Benefits Matters. AmeriSource and Bergen have agreed to work together
to design benefit plans to be adopted by AmeriSource-Bergen for the benefit of
its employees as soon as practicable following the merger. Until the adoption of
new plans, AmeriSource-Bergen has agreed to cause all AmeriSource and Bergen
plans to be maintained in full force and effect. The benefit plans adopted by
AmeriSource-Bergen will provide past service credit for employees of AmeriSource
and of Bergen as service was credited under the corresponding plans maintained
by AmeriSource or Bergen immediately prior to the adoption of the
AmeriSource-Bergen plans. In addition, the AmeriSource-Bergen plans that are
welfare benefit plans will waive any pre-existing condition limitations other
than those to which employees are subject under the terms of the applicable
AmeriSource or Bergen plan, credit any complete or partial satisfaction of any
deductibles or out-of-pocket expenses incurred by any AmeriSource or Bergen
employee or the dependent or beneficiary of any employee and will credit any
credit balances or other entitlements under any cafeteria plan maintained by
AmeriSource or Bergen.

         Each of the board of directors of AmeriSource and Bergen will cause
outstanding stock options granted prior to February 15, 2001 under their
respective stock option plans to vest as of the close of business on the last
business day prior to the merger, and to become exercisable upon the earlier to
occur of their normal vesting date and the first anniversary of the completion
of the merger. If the option holder is terminated following the merger for
cause, the exercise period of such employee's options will be as set forth in
the relevant option plan of AmeriSource or Bergen, as the case may be. In all
cases where employment is terminated following the merger other than for cause,
the exercise period of any such options will terminate as of the later of:

         -        13 months from the completion of the merger; or

         -        the end of the exercise period of such AmeriSource or Bergen
                  option as set forth in the applicable AmeriSource option plan
                  (for AmeriSource options) or Bergen option plan (for Bergen
                  options) at the time the merger agreement was executed.

         Prior to the completion of the merger, AmeriSource and Bergen may grant
options to purchase shares of their respective common stock so long as:

         -        such grants are made at such times and in such amounts as are
                  consistent with previous grants by AmeriSource or Bergen in
                  the ordinary course of business, and

         -        such options provide that the consummation of the mergers
                  contemplated by the merger agreement will not be an event
                  which accelerates the vesting of such options.

         The Bergen board of directors has agreed, at least 91 days prior to the
completion of the merger, to take all actions necessary to amend the benefits of
each of Neil F. Dimick, Brent R. Martini, Charles J. Carpenter and Steven H.
Collis under the Bergen Fourth Amended and Restated Supplemental Executive
Retirement Plan and the Bergen Capital Accumulation Plan, in order to effectuate
the agreements among Bergen, AmeriSource-Bergen and each of such executives.

         Amendment, Extension and Waiver. The merger agreement may be amended by
the parties, by action taken or authorized by their respective boards of
directors, at any time before or after approval of the merger agreement by
shareholders of AmeriSource or Bergen. After the approval has been obtained, no
amendment may be made which by law requires further approval by the shareholders
of AmeriSource or Bergen without such further approval. All amendments to the
merger agreement must be in writing and signed by each party.

         At any time prior to the completion of the merger, the parties may, by
action taken or authorized by their respective boards of directors, to the
extent legally allowed:

         -        extend the time for the performance of any of the obligations
                  or other acts of the other parties;

         -        waive any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties
                  contained in the merger agreement or in any document delivered
                  pursuant to the merger agreement; and

         -        waive compliance with any of the agreements or conditions
                  contained in the merger agreement.

All extensions or waivers must be in writing and signed by the party against
whom the waiver is to be effective.

         Representations and Warranties. The merger agreement contains customary
and substantially reciprocal representations and warranties by AmeriSource and
Bergen relating to, among other things:

         -        organization and standing;

         -        subsidiaries;

         -        corporate power and authority;

         -        capitalization;

         -        conflicts, consents and approvals;

         -        no material adverse change;

         -        Securities and Exchange Commission documents;

         -        taxes;

         -        compliance with law;

         -        intellectual property;

         -        title to properties;

         -        registration statement, joint proxy statement;

         -        litigation;

         -        brokerage and finder's fees expenses;

         -        reorganization;

         -        employee benefit plans;

         -        contracts;

         -        labor matters;

         -        undisclosed liabilities;

         -        operation of business relationships;

         -        permits compliance;

         -        environmental matters;

         -        opinion of financial advisors;

         -        board recommendation vote required;

         -        state takeover law and rights agreements; and

STOCK OPTION AGREEMENTS

         The following summary of the stock option agreements is qualified in
its entirety by reference to the complete text of the stock option agreements,
which are incorporated by reference and attached as Annexes B and C to this
joint proxy statement-prospectus. We urge you to read the full text of the stock
option agreements.

         In connection with the execution and delivery of the merger agreement,
AmeriSource and Bergen entered into:

         -        the Bergen stock option agreement, under which Bergen granted
                  to AmeriSource an irrevocable option to purchase, in whole or
                  in part, an aggregate of up to 26,961,420 shares of Bergen
                  common stock (representing approximately 19.9% of the issued
                  and outstanding shares of common stock of Bergen) at a price
                  of $17.9376 per share; and

         -        the AmeriSource stock option agreement, under which
                  AmeriSource granted to Bergen an irrevocable option to
                  purchase, in whole or in part, an aggregate of up to
                  10,472,304 shares of AmeriSource Class A common stock
                  (representing approximately 19.9% of the issued and
                  outstanding shares of Class A common stock of AmeriSource) at
                  a price of $48.48 per share.

         Exercise of the Options. The option granted by AmeriSource to Bergen
pursuant to the AmeriSource stock option agreement, in certain circumstances,
may be exercised, in whole or in part, at any time, after the date on which
Bergen becomes unconditionally entitled to receive the AmeriSource termination
fee pursuant to the merger agreement. Similarly, the option granted by Bergen to
AmeriSource pursuant to the Bergen stock option agreement, in certain
circumstances, may be exercised, in whole or in part, at any time, after the
date on which AmeriSource becomes unconditionally entitled to receive the Bergen
termination fee pursuant to the merger agreement.

         The right to purchase shares of common stock under each of the
AmeriSource stock option agreement and the Bergen stock option agreement will
expire on the first to occur of:

         -        the date which is 180 days following the occurrence of an
                  event causing the AmeriSource option or Bergen option, as the
                  case may be, to be exercisable, unless the option cannot be
                  exercised prior to such expiration date as a result of any
                  injunction, order or similar restraint issued by a court of
                  competent jurisdiction, in which case the exercise period for
                  the option will terminate on the later of:

                           of an event causing the AmeriSource option or Bergen

                  -        the 10th business day after such injunction, order or

                  termination upon the occurrence of certain events, in which
                  case the option will not terminate until the later of:

                  -        180 days following the time such termination fee
                           becomes payable; and

                           occur which would result in AmeriSource or Bergen, as
                           the case may be, having the right to receive a
                           termination fee, in certain circumstances, pursuant
                           to the merger agreement.

         Adjustments Upon Changes in Capitalization and Substitute Option. The
number and kind of securities subject to each stock option agreement and the
exercise price will be adjusted for any change in the number of issued and
outstanding shares of common stock of the issuer of the option by reason of a
stock dividend, split-up, recapitalization or the like or in the event of any
new issuance of common stock of the issuer of the option (other than an issuance
pursuant to such option).

         Cash Payment in Respect of the Option. Under each of the stock option
agreements, the optionholder has the right, at any time after the option has
become exercisable, to elect to receive a cash payment in an amount equal to the
sum of:

         (i)      the difference between:

                  (x)      the higher of:

                           -        the highest price per share at which a
                                    tender or exchange offer has been made for
                                    the common stock of the issuer of the
                                    option, and

                           -        the highest closing price of the common
                                    stock of the issuer as reported by the New
                                    York Stock Exchange Composite Tape for any
                                    day during the exercise period, and

                  (y)      the purchase price paid for the shares of the common
                           stock of the issuer of the option;

                  multiplied by the number of shares subject to the option with
                  respect to which the option has not been exercised or has been
                  exercised but the related closing of such option has not
                  occurred but only if (x) is greater than (y); and

         (ii)     the greater of:

                  -        the highest price per share at which a tender or
                           exchange offer has been made for the common stock of
                           the issuer of the option,

                  -        the highest closing price of the common stock as
                           reported by the New York Stock Exchange Composite
                           Tape for any day during the exercise period, and

                  -        the purchase price paid for the shares of the common
                           stock of the issuer of the option upon exercise of
                           the option,

                  multiplied by the number of shares of the common stock of the
                  issuer of the option acquired pursuant to the exercise of the
                  option.

         Profit Limitations. The AmeriSource stock option agreement provides
that in no event will Bergen's total profit under the AmeriSource stock option
agreement (including any amount received as a termination fee under the merger
agreement) exceed in the aggregate an amount equal to $125,000,000. Similarly,
the Bergen stock option agreement provides that in no event will AmeriSource's
total profit under the Bergen stock option agreement (including any amount
received as a termination fee under the merger agreement) exceed in the
aggregate an amount equal to $125,000,000.

         If the total profit that would otherwise be received by the
optionholder exceeds the maximum amount permissible, the optionholder must, in
its sole discretion:

         -        deliver to the issuer for cancellation shares previously
                  purchased;

         -        reduce the amount of the termination fee to be paid by the
                  optionholder (other than payments with respect to expenses);

         -        pay cash or other consideration to the issuer of the option;
                  or

         -        take any combination of these actions set forth above, so that
                  its total profit does not exceed the maximum amount.

         Registration Rights and Listing. Each of the stock option agreements
provides that the optionholder has specified rights to require the issuer to
register, under the Securities Act of 1933 and any applicable state law, all
shares purchased by the optionholder pursuant to the stock option agreement at
anytime within two years from the closing of the exercise of the option. Each of
the stock option agreements also provides that the optionholder has specified
rights to require that the issuer list the shares purchased by the optionholder
pursuant to the stock option agreement on the New York Stock Exchange or other
national securities exchange or trading system on which shares of the issuer's
common stock are listed for trading or quotation.

         Assignability. Neither of the stock option agreements, nor any of the
rights, interests or obligations under them may be assigned by either of the
parties without the prior written consent of the other party.

         Effect of Stock Option Agreements. The stock option agreements are
intended to increase the likelihood that the merger will be completed on the
terms set forth in the merger agreement. Consequently, the stock option
agreements may discourage persons who might be interested in acquiring all or a
significant interest in AmeriSource or Bergen before completion of the merger
from considering or proposing an acquisition, even if those persons were
prepared to offer higher consideration per share of AmeriSource common stock or
Bergen common stock than the consideration implicit in the merger or a higher
price per share of AmeriSource common stock or Bergen common stock than the
stock market price.

                         AMERISOURCE-BERGEN CORPORATION
        UNAUDITED PRO FORMA CONSOLIDATED CONDENSED FINANCIAL INFORMATION

         The following unaudited pro forma consolidated condensed financial
statements are presented to illustrate the effects of the merger on the
historical financial position and results of operations of AmeriSource and
Bergen, using the assumptions set forth below. Such information is not
necessarily indicative of the financial position or results of operations of
AmeriSource-Bergen that would have occurred if the merger had been consummated
as of the dates indicated, nor should it be construed as being a representation
of the future financial position or results of operations of AmeriSource-Bergen.

         Management of both companies expect that the benefits of the merger
will include synergies to the combined entity resulting from, among other
things, the consolidation of distribution facilities, the elimination of
duplicate administrative functions, inventory purchasing efficiencies, and
working capital reductions. These synergies are estimated at $125 million per
year by the end of the third year following consummation of the merger. However,
such synergies will be partially offset by merger-related integration expenses.
The accompanying pro forma financial information does not include any
adjustments to reflect these anticipated merger-related synergies or expenses.

         The unaudited pro forma information has been derived in part from, and
should be read in conjunction with, the historical audited and unaudited
consolidated financial statements, including the notes thereto, of AmeriSource
and Bergen, which are incorporated herein by reference.

         The unaudited pro forma consolidated condensed balance sheet of
AmeriSource-Bergen at March 31, 2001 assumes that the merger took place on that
date. The unaudited pro forma consolidated condensed statements of operations of
AmeriSource-Bergen for the year ended September 30, 2000 and the six months
ended March 31, 2001 assume that the merger took place on October 1, 1999. Both
AmeriSource and Bergen have a fiscal year ending September 30; therefore, the
accompanying pro forma operating results represent the full fiscal year 2000 and
the first half of fiscal 2001 for each entity.

         Consummation of the merger is conditioned on promulgation by the
Financial Accounting Standards Board of a final Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards providing for accounting treatment of the merger and the
other related transactions in all material respects as in the Exposure Draft of
the proposed Statement entitled Business Combinations and Intangible
Assets-Accounting for Goodwill, dated February 14, 2001. As a result, the
following unaudited pro forma consolidated condensed statements of operations
have been prepared under both the existing accounting rules and the rules
proposed within the Exposure Draft, which eliminate the amortization of
goodwill. The effect of the Exposure Draft has been reflected in the Adjustments
for Proposed Accounting Rules and the AmeriSource-Bergen Pro Forma as Adjusted
columns.

                         AMERISOURCE-BERGEN CORPORATION
    NOTES TO UNAUDITED PRO FORMA CONSOLIDATED CONDENSED FINANCIAL INFORMATION

NOTE 1. BASIS OF PRO FORMA PRESENTATION

         The unaudited pro forma consolidated condensed financial statements
give effect to the proposed merger using the purchase method of accounting.
Since the current AmeriSource shareholders will own approximately 51% of
AmeriSource-Bergen's common stock immediately after the closing of the merger,
AmeriSource-Bergen will account for the merger as an acquisition by AmeriSource
of Bergen.

         Following is a summary of the estimated aggregate purchase price (in
thousands):

          Market value of common stock to be issued
             to Bergen shareholders                                $  2,294,672
          Fair value of Bergen's stock options                           77,712
          Estimated transaction costs                                    45,000
                                                                   ------------
             Total purchase price                                  $  2,417,384
                                                                   ============

         AmeriSource-Bergen will issue approximately 50.0 million shares of
AmeriSource-Bergen common stock in exchange for approximately 135.2 million
outstanding common shares of Bergen, based on an exchange ratio of 0.37 to 1
(each outstanding Bergen share will be converted into 0.37 of a share of
AmeriSource-Bergen stock). The AmeriSource-Bergen common stock to be issued was
valued based on a price per share of $45.86, which was the weighted-average
market price of the AmeriSource common stock during the few days before and
after the date the merger was announced.

         AmeriSource-Bergen will issue fully-vested options to purchase
approximately 3.3 million shares of AmeriSource-Bergen common stock in exchange
for all of the fully-vested outstanding options of Bergen, based on a
weighted-average fair value of $23.29 per option. The fair value of the options
was determined using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model and was based on a
weighted-average exercise price of $36.63 and the following weighted-average
assumptions: expected volatility - 50.90%; expected life - 4 years; risk-free
interest rate - 4.64%; and expected dividend yield - 0.21%.

         The estimated pro forma allocation of the purchase price is as follows
(in thousands):

         Bergen's historical assets and liabilities                 $   773,568
         Adjustment of Bergen's historical assets
           and liabilities to fair value                                122,022
         Elimination of Bergen's historical goodwill                   (667,947)
         New goodwill                                                 2,189,741
                                                                    -----------
           Total purchase price                                     $ 2,417,384
                                                                    ===========

         The above pro forma allocation of the purchase price to the acquired
assets and liabilities is based on management's best estimate of the respective
fair values at this early stage of the merger process. However, such allocation
is preliminary and is subject to the completion of a more comprehensive
valuation process. Accordingly, the final allocation of the purchase price could
differ materially from the pro forma allocation reflected herein if materially
different fair value information is obtained.

         Management expects that there will be significant merger-related
integration costs associated with the consolidation of distribution facilities
and administrative functions, including employee severance costs and costs
associated with exiting certain facilities and activities. As management is in
the early stages of its integration planning, the amounts of such merger-related
integration costs have not been determined.

Accordingly, such merger-related costs are not reflected in the pro forma
purchase price allocation or the accompanying pro forma statements of
operations.

         The existing principal bank credit facilities of AmeriSource and Bergen
will be terminated in connection with the merger and it is anticipated that a
new bank credit facility will be negotiated for the combined enterprise. No
adjustment has been made to anticipate the terms of such new facility.

NOTE 2. PRO FORMA ADJUSTMENTS TO THE BALANCE SHEET

         (a)      Represents the adjustment of Bergen's inventory to fair value,
                  primarily consisting of the elimination of Bergen's last-in,
                  first-out (LIFO) valuation reserve.

         (b)      Represents the reclassification of income taxes payable
                  against income taxes receivable based on the consolidated
                  AmeriSource-Bergen net tax receivable balance.

         (c)      Represents the establishment of deferred income tax assets and
                  liabilities to reflect differences between the book and tax
                  bases resulting from the pro forma adjustments described
                  herein and the reclassification of current deferred income tax
                  assets against current deferred income tax liabilities based
                  on the consolidated AmeriSource-Bergen net current deferred
                  income tax liability.

         (d)      Represents the adjustment of Bergen's property and equipment
                  to its estimated fair value.

         (e)      Reflects the elimination of Bergen's historical goodwill
                  balance.

         (f)      Represents the preliminary allocation of the purchase price to
                  goodwill as described in Note 1 above.

         (g)      Represents the adjustment of Bergen facility leases to their
                  estimated fair value, based on current market rental rates.

         (h)      Represents the estimated amounts payable in connection with
                  the merger under certain executive compensation and benefit
                  arrangements.

         (i)      Represents the issuance of new shares of AmeriSource-Bergen
                  common stock in exchange for Bergen's common shares, and the
                  issuance of new AmeriSource-Bergen stock options in exchange
                  for Bergen's stock options, as described in Note 1 above. In
                  addition, reflects accrued expenses of $45 million for the
                  estimated transaction costs to be incurred by AmeriSource and
                  Bergen in connection with the merger, including investment
                  banking, legal and other professional fees, and other
                  merger-related fees.

         (j)      Represents the adjustment of Bergen's long-term debt to fair
                  value, based on quoted market prices.

         (k)      Represents the adjustment of Bergen's pension liabilities to
                  their estimated fair value.

         (l)      Represents the adjustment of Bergen's preferred securities of
                  subsidiary trust to fair value, based on quoted market prices.

         (m)      Represents the elimination of Bergen's historical
                  stockholders' equity.

NOTE 3. PRO FORMA ADJUSTMENTS TO STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS

         (a)      Represents the net effect of two adjustments: (1) the
                  reduction of periodic pension expense, due to the adjustment
                  of Bergen's pension liabilities to their fair value, and (2)
                  the amortization of the fair value of Bergen's leases over the
                  average remaining lease term of four years.

         (b)      Represents an increase in the depreciation of Bergen's
                  property and equipment based on the adjustment of such assets
                  to fair value.

         (c)      Represents the elimination of Bergen's historical goodwill
                  amortization expense.

         (d)      Represents the amortization of the new AmeriSource-Bergen
                  goodwill over an estimated useful life of 40 years.

         (e)      Represents the elimination of Bergen's $505.3 million goodwill
                  impairment charge in fiscal year 2000.

         (f)      Represents an increase to interest expense as a result of the
                  adjustment of Bergen's long-term debt to its fair value as
                  described in Note 2(j) above. The difference between the fair
                  value and the face amount of each borrowing is amortized as
                  additional interest expense over the remaining term of the
                  borrowing. The borrowings mature at various dates between 2003
                  and 2008.

         (g)      Represents the aggregate pro forma income tax effect of Note
                  3(a) through 3(f) above.

         (h)      Represents an increase in expense as a result of the
                  adjustment of the Bergen preferred securities of subsidiary
                  trust to its fair value as described in Note 2(l) above. The
                  difference between the fair value and the face amount of the
                  securities is accreted to redemption value over the remaining
                  term of the securities, which mature in 2039. These
                  adjustments are recorded as preferred distributions, net of an
                  assumed 40% income tax benefit.

         (i)      Represents the elimination of the amortization of goodwill,
                  including the tax benefit on the portion of goodwill
                  amortization relating to tax-deductible goodwill, in
                  accordance with the proposed Financial Accounting Standards
                  Board's Exposure Draft entitled Business Combinations and
                  Intangible Assets - Accounting for Goodwill. This adjustment
                  assumes that such proposed standard is adopted as currently
                  drafted. The final standard, if and when adopted, could differ
                  materially from the current Exposure Draft and any cessation
                  of amortization would not be effective until the date
                  specified in the final standard.

NOTE 4. RECLASSIFICATIONS

         Certain reclassifications have been made to the historical financial
statements of AmeriSource and Bergen to conform to the presentation expected to
be used by the combined company.

NOTE 5. EFFECT OF SPECIAL ITEMS

         AmeriSource's historical amounts for the twelve months ended September
30, 2000, include the effect of a pre-tax $1.1 million reversal of costs related
to facility consolidations and employee severance. Bergen's historical amounts
for the twelve months ended September 30, 2000, excluding the write-down of
goodwill of $505.3 million described in Note 3(e) above, include special pre-tax
charges for provision for doubtful receivables associated with two customers of
$66.7 million, a restructuring charge of $10.7 million,

abandonment of capitalized software of $6.3 million, officer severance of $4.0
million, and an impairment of an investment of $5.0 million. The after-tax
effect of these special items on the unaudited pro forma consolidated condensed
results for the twelve months ended September 30, 2000 was to:

         -        reduce pro forma income from continuing operations by $55.3
                  million; and

         -        reduce pro forma earnings from continuing operations per share
                  - assuming dilution by $.54 per share.

NOTE 6. EARNINGS (LOSS) PER SHARE FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS

         The pro forma earnings (loss) per share from continuing operations has
been adjusted to reflect the issuance of AmeriSource-Bergen common stock in the
merger based on Bergen's historical weighted average shares outstanding for the
periods presented at the exchange ratio of 0.37 to 1. In addition, Bergen's
historical weighted average shares outstanding - assuming dilution for the
fiscal year ended September 30, 2000 have been adjusted to include the dilutive
effect of Bergen's stock options, which were anti-dilutive in Bergen's
historical financial statements. Additionally, the earnings per share - assuming
dilution calculation for the six months ended March 31, 2001 considers the
AmeriSource convertible subordinated notes as if they were converted and,
therefore, the effect of interest expense related to these notes is added back
to net income in determining income available to common stockholders.

                 DESCRIPTION OF AMERISOURCE-BERGEN CAPITAL STOCK

         This section of the joint proxy statement-prospectus describes the

ANTI-TAKEOVER CONSIDERATIONS

         Delaware law contains and the AmeriSource-Bergen amended and restated
certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws will contain a
number of provisions which may have the effect of discouraging transactions that
involve an actual or threatened change of control of AmeriSource-Bergen. For a
description of the provisions, see "Comparison of Rights of AmeriSource-Bergen
Shareholders, AmeriSource Shareholders and Bergen Shareholders-Number and
Election of Directors," "Vacancies on the Board of Directors and Removal of
Directors," "Amendments to the Restated Certificate of Incorporation,"
"Amendments to Restated Bylaws," "Shareholders Rights Plans" and "State
Anti-Takeover Statutes."

            COMPARISON OF RIGHTS OF AMERISOURCE-BERGEN SHAREHOLDERS,
                AMERISOURCE SHAREHOLDERS AND BERGEN SHAREHOLDERS

         AmeriSource-Bergen and AmeriSource are organized under the laws of the
State of Delaware. Any differences, therefore, in the rights of holders of
AmeriSource-Bergen capital stock and AmeriSource capital stock arise primarily
from differences in their respective amended and restated certificates of
incorporation, amended and restated bylaws and rights agreements. Bergen is
organized under the laws of New Jersey and the rights of holders of Bergen
capital stock may be different than the rights of holders of AmeriSource-Bergen
capital stock or AmeriSource capital stock. Upon completion of the merger,
holders of AmeriSource

capital stock and holders of Bergen capital stock will become holders of
AmeriSource-Bergen capital stock and their rights will be governed by Delaware
law, the AmeriSource-Bergen amended and restated certificate of incorporation
and the AmeriSource-Bergen amended and restated bylaws.

         This section of the proxy statement-prospectus describes the material
differences between the rights of AmeriSource shareholders and Bergen
shareholders. This section also includes a brief description of the material
rights that AmeriSource-Bergen shareholders are expected to have following
completion of the merger although in some cases the board of directors of
AmeriSource-Bergen retains the discretion to alter those rights without
shareholder consent. This section does not include a complete description of all
the differences among the rights of these shareholders, nor does it include a
complete description of the specific rights of these shareholders. In addition,
the identification of some of the differences in the rights of these
shareholders as material is not intended to indicate that other differences that
are equally important do not exist. All AmeriSource shareholders and Bergen
shareholders are urged to carefully read the relevant provisions of Delaware law
and the relevant provisions of the New Jersey Business Corporation Act, which we
refer to as "New Jersey law", as well as the amended and restated certificates
of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws of each of AmeriSource, Bergen
and AmeriSource-Bergen. Copies of the forms of amended and restated certificate
of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws for AmeriSource-Bergen are
attached to this joint proxy statement-prospectus as Annexes J and K,
respectively. Copies of the amended and restated certificates of incorporation
and amended and restated bylaws of AmeriSource and Bergen will be sent to
AmeriSource shareholders and Bergen shareholders, as applicable, upon request.

eight members. The AmeriSource restated bylaws provide that the AmeriSource
board of directors will consist of a number of directors to be determined by the
AmeriSource board of directors. The AmeriSource restated certificate of
incorporation provides that the holders of AmeriSource Class A common stock have

provide.

incorporation provides for the Bergen board of directors to be divided into
three classes, as nearly equal in size as possible, with one class being elected
annually. Members of the Bergen board of directors are elected to serve a term
of three years and until their successors are duly elected and qualified.

VACANCIES ON THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS AND REMOVAL OF DIRECTORS

         AmeriSource. Neither AmeriSource's restated certificate of
incorporation nor AmeriSource's restated bylaws provide for the removal of
directors from the AmeriSource board of directors or the filling of vacancies on
AmeriSource's board of directors. Pursuant to Delaware law, where a board is not
classified, directors may be removed, with or without cause, by the holders of a
majority of the shares entitled to vote. In addition, pursuant to Delaware law,
newly created directorships resulting from an increase in the authorized number
of directors and vacancies created by resignation may be filled by a majority of
the directors then in office.

         Bergen. Bergen's restated certificate of incorporation provides that a
director may be removed at any time, either for or without cause, by, and only
by, the holders of record of Bergen common stock at a

meeting of such shareholders. The resulting vacancy may be filled at such
meeting. Any vacancy caused by the death or resignation of a director elected by
holders of Bergen's common stock may be filled only by the holders of Bergen's
common stock at a meeting called for that purpose, or by a majority of the
remaining directors elected by those holders.

         AmeriSource-Bergen. AmeriSource-Bergen's amended and restated
certificate of incorporation will provide that a director may not be removed
except for cause and with the affirmative vote of 80% of AmeriSource-Bergen's
shareholders. The amended and restated certificate of incorporation will also

in the board of directors for any reason will be filled only by a majority of
the directors remaining in office, and directors so elected will hold office

AMENDMENTS TO THE CERTIFICATE OF INCORPORATION

         Under Delaware Law. Under Delaware law, an amendment to the certificate
of incorporation of a corporation requires the approval of the corporation's
board of directors and the approval of holders of a majority of the outstanding
stock entitled to vote upon the proposed amendment, unless a higher vote is
required by the corporation's certificate of incorporation.

         Under New Jersey Law. Under New Jersey law, a proposed amendment to a
corporation's certificate of incorporation requires approval by the board of
directors and an affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast by the holders
of shares entitled to vote thereon; provided that in the case of a corporation
organized prior to January 1, 1969, the proposed amendment requires the
affirmative vote of two-thirds of the votes cast by the holders of shares
entitled to vote thereon, unless the corporation has adopted the majority voting
requirement by amendment of its certificate of incorporation adopted by the
affirmative vote of two-thirds of the votes cast by the holders of shares
entitled to vote thereon. Bergen was organized prior to 1969 and did adopt the
majority voting requirement in accordance with New Jersey law.

         AmeriSource. AmeriSource's restated certificate of incorporation
requires the vote of a majority of all of the directors and a vote of a majority
of the outstanding stock entitled to vote to amend AmeriSource's restated
certificate of incorporation.

         Bergen. Under Bergen's restated certificate of incorporation, as
amended, a proposed amendment to the restated certificate of incorporation
requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast of the outstanding
Bergen common stock entitled to vote thereon. In addition, the restated
certificate of incorporation provides that a proposed amendment to the restated
certificate of incorporation which would materially alter or change the powers,
preferences or special rights of the junior preferred stock so as to affect them
adversely, requires the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority or more of
the outstanding shares of junior preferred stock, voting separately as a class.

         AmeriSource-Bergen. AmeriSource-Bergen's amended and restated
certificate of incorporation will provide that AmeriSource-Bergen reserves the
right to amend, alter, change or repeal the provisions of the amended and
restated certificate of incorporation in the manner prescribed by Delaware law.
However, certain provisions of the amended and restated certificate of
incorporation will require the affirmative vote of 80% of the voting power of
all the shares of stock of AmeriSource-Bergen then entitled to vote generally in
the election of directors in order to be amended, altered, or repealed, unless
such amendment is declared advisable by 75% of the entire board of directors.

AMENDMENTS TO BYLAWS

         Under Delaware Law. Under Delaware law, shareholders entitled to vote
have the power to adopt, amend or repeal bylaws. In addition, a corporation may,
in its certificate of incorporation, confer this power on the board of
directors. The shareholders always have the power to adopt, amend or repeal the
bylaws, even though the board may also be delegated the power.

         Under New Jersey Law. Under New Jersey law, the board of directors of a
corporation has the power to make, alter and repeal bylaws unless such power is
reserved to the shareholders in the certificate of incorporation, but bylaws
made by the board of directors may be altered or repealed and new bylaws may be
adopted by the shareholders. In addition, the shareholders may prescribe in the
bylaws that any bylaw made by them shall not be altered or repealed by the board
of directors.

         AmeriSource. AmeriSource's restated certificate of incorporation
requires the vote of a majority of all of the directors or a vote of a majority
of the outstanding stock entitled to vote to amend AmeriSource's restated
bylaws.

         Bergen. Under Bergen's amended and restated bylaws, the Bergen
shareholders have the right to adopt, amend or repeal the bylaws. Subject to
such right of the Bergen shareholders, the board of directors of Bergen may
adopt, amend or repeal the bylaws; provided that Bergen's board of directors may
adopt, amend or repeal a bylaw or an amendment thereto changing the number of
directors only for the purpose of fixing the exact number of directors within
the minimum (currently nine directors) and maximum (currently 15 directors)
limits specified in Bergen's amended and restated bylaws.

         AmeriSource-Bergen. AmeriSource-Bergen's amended and restated
certificate of incorporation will provide that the board of directors is
expressly authorized to make, alter, amend or repeal the bylaws without the
assent or vote of the shareholders. AmeriSource-Bergen's amended and restated
certificate of incorporation will also provide that the shareholders may, at any
annual or special meeting, make, alter, amend or repeal the bylaws by the
affirmative vote of the holders of not less than 80% of the stock entitled to
vote generally in the election of directors.

ACTION BY WRITTEN CONSENT

         Under Delaware Law. Delaware law provides that, unless otherwise stated
in the certificate of incorporation, any action which may be taken at an annual
meeting or special meeting of shareholders may be taken without a meeting, if a
consent in writing is signed by the holders of the outstanding stock having the
minimum number of votes necessary to authorize the action at a meeting of
shareholders.

         Under New Jersey Law. New Jersey law provides that, except as otherwise
provided in the certificate of incorporation, any action that may be taken at a
meeting of shareholders, other than the annual election of directors, may be
taken without a meeting, without prior notice and without a vote, upon the
written consent of shareholders who would have been entitled to cast the minimum
number of votes which would be necessary to authorize such action at a meeting
at which all shareholders entitled to vote thereon were present and voting. The
corporation must notify non-consenting shareholders at least 20 days in advance
of the proposed effective date of a merger, consolidation, statutory share
exchange, or sale, lease exchange, or other disposition of all or substantially
all, assets of the corporation if not in the usual and regular course of its
business and at least 10 days in advance of the proposed effective date of any
other action. Under New Jersey law, any action that may be taken by shareholders
at a meeting may be taken without a meeting with the unanimous written consent
of all shareholders entitled to vote at such meeting and, in the case of a
merger, consolidation, statutory share exchange, or sale, lease exchange, or
other disposition of all or substantially all, assets of the corporation, if not
in the usual and regular course of its business, advance notice is given to all
other shareholders who are not entitled to vote thereon.

         AmeriSource. Neither AmeriSource's restated certificate of
incorporation nor AmeriSource's restated bylaws provides for actions of
shareholders without a meeting. Pursuant to Delaware law, absent any provision
to the contrary in a company's certificate of incorporation, any action required
or permitted to be taken at any annual or special meeting of shareholders may be
taken without a meeting, without prior notice and without a vote, if a consent
in writing, setting forth the action so taken, is signed by the holders of
outstanding stock having not less than the minimum number of votes that would be
necessary to authorize or take such action at a meeting at which all shares
entitled to vote thereon were present and voted. Prompt

notice of the taking of any corporate action without a meeting by less than
unanimous written consent must be given to those shareholders who did not
consent in writing and who would have been entitled to notice if the action had
been taken at a meeting.

         Bergen. Bergen's amended and restated bylaws provide that any
shareholder of record who seeks to have shareholders authorize or take corporate
action by written consent shall, by written notice to the Secretary, request
that Bergen's board of directors set a record date, which date shall not precede
or be more than ten days after the date on which the resolution setting the
record date is adopted by the board of directors.

         AmeriSource-Bergen. AmeriSource-Bergen's amended and restated
certificate of incorporation and bylaws will provide that the shareholders may
not take any action without a duly called meeting of the shareholders.

ABILITY TO CALL SPECIAL MEETINGS OF THE SHAREHOLDERS

         AmeriSource. AmeriSource's restated bylaws provide that special
meetings of the shareholders may be called at any time by either the president,
the board of directors or the holders of a majority of the shares of stock
entitled to vote at the meeting.

         Bergen. Bergen's amended and restated bylaws provide that special
meetings for any purpose or purposes may be called at any time by the chairman
of the board of directors, by the president or by the board of directors of
Bergen.

         AmeriSource-Bergen. AmeriSource-Bergen's amended and restated
certificate of incorporation will provide that special meetings of shareholders
may be called at any time by the board of directors pursuant to a resolution
duly adopted by a majority of the members of the board of directors and that the
ability of the shareholders to call a special meeting of shareholders will be
specifically denied.

NOTICE OF SHAREHOLDER ACTION

         AmeriSource. AmeriSource's restated certificate of incorporation and
AmeriSource's restated bylaws do not contain provisions requiring advance notice
for the nomination of directors or of business to be brought before a
shareholders' meeting by a shareholder.

         Bergen. Bergen's amended and restated bylaws provide that in order for
nominations of directors or other business to be properly brought before an
annual meeting by a shareholder of Bergen, the shareholder must give notice to
Bergen not less than 60 days nor more than 90 days prior to the anniversary of
the previous annual meeting of shareholders. The notice must contain specific
information regarding the nominee for director, or the other business to be
addressed, as well as information regarding the shareholder who is proposing the
nomination.

         AmeriSource-Bergen. AmeriSource-Bergen's bylaws will provide that in
order for nominations of directors or other business to be properly brought
before an annual meeting by a shareholder of AmeriSource-Bergen, the shareholder
must give notice to AmeriSource-Bergen not less than 60 days nor more than 90
days prior to the anniversary of the previous annual meeting of shareholders.
The notice must contain specific information regarding the nominee for director,
or other business to be addressed, as well as information regarding the
shareholder who is proposing the nomination.

LIMITATION OF PERSONAL LIABILITY OF DIRECTORS AND OFFICERS

         Under Delaware Law. Delaware law provides that a corporation may
include in its certificate of incorporation a provision limiting or eliminating
the liability of its directors to the corporation and its shareholders for
monetary damages arising from a breach of fiduciary duty, except for:

         -        a breach of the duty of loyalty to the corporation or its
                  shareholders;

         -        acts or omissions not in good faith or which involve
                  intentional misconduct or a knowing violation of law;

         -        payment of a dividend or the repurchase or redemption of stock
                  in violation of Delaware law; or

         -        any transaction from which the director derived an improper
                  personal benefit.

         Under New Jersey Law. New Jersey law allows a New Jersey corporation to
provide in its certificate of incorporation that a director or officer shall not
be personally liable, or shall be liable only to the extent therein provided, to
the corporation or its shareholders for damages for breach of any duty owed to
the corporation or its shareholders, except that such provision shall not
relieve a director or officer from liability for any breach of duty based upon
an act or omission:

         -        in breach of such person's duty of loyalty to the corporation
                  or its shareholders;

         -        not in good faith or involving a knowing violation of law; or

         -        resulting in receipt by such person of an improper personal
                  benefit.

         AmeriSource. The directors of AmeriSource are entitled to the benefits
of all limitations on the liability of directors generally that are now or
hereafter become available under Delaware law.

         Bergen. Bergen's restated certificate of incorporation, as amended,
provides that so long as permitted by law, no director or officer of Bergen will
be personally liable to Bergen or its shareholders for damages for breach of any
duty owed by such person to Bergen or its shareholders. This does not relieve
any such person from liability to the extent provided by applicable law for any
breach of duty based upon an act or omission (a) in breach of such person's duty
of loyalty to Bergen or its shareholders, (b) not in good faith or involving a
knowing violation of law or (c) resulting in receipt by such person of an
improper personal benefit.

         AmeriSource-Bergen. The amended and restated certificate of
incorporation of AmeriSource-Bergen will provide that the directors of
AmeriSource-Bergen are entitled to the benefits of all limitations on the
liability of directors that are now or hereafter become available under Delaware
law. Specifically, no director of AmeriSource-Bergen will be liable to
AmeriSource-Bergen or its shareholders for monetary damages for breach of
fiduciary duty as director, except for liability (a) for any breach of the
director's duty of loyalty to AmeriSource-Bergen or its shareholders, (b) for
acts or omissions not in good faith or which involve intentional misconduct or a
knowing violation of law, (c) under section 174 of the Delaware law, which
pertains, among other things, to liability for the unlawful payment of
dividends, or (d) for any transaction from which the director derived an
improper personal benefit.

INDEMNIFICATION OF DIRECTORS AND OFFICERS

         Under Delaware Law. Under Delaware law, a corporation may indemnify
directors and officers:

         -        for actions taken in good faith and in a manner they
                  reasonably believed to be in, or not opposed to, the best
                  interests of the corporation; and

         -        with respect to any criminal proceeding, they had no
                  reasonable cause to believe that their conduct was unlawful.

         In addition, Delaware law provides that a corporation may advance to a
director or officer expenses incurred in defending any action upon receipt of an
undertaking by the director or officer to repay the amount advanced if it is
ultimately determined that he or she is not entitled to indemnification.

         Under New Jersey Law. New Jersey law permits a New Jersey corporation
to indemnify directors and officers under certain circumstances and mandates
indemnification under certain circumstances of:

         -        any person who is or was a director, officer, employee or
                  agent of the indemnifying corporation or of any constituent
                  corporation absorbed by the indemnifying corporation in a
                  consolidation or merger; and

         -        any person who is or was a director, officer, trustee,
                  employee or agent of any other enterprise, serving as such at
                  the request of the indemnifying corporation, or of any such
                  constituent corporation, or the legal representative of any
                  such director, officer, trustee, employee or agent.

         New Jersey law permits a corporation to indemnify a corporate agent
against his expenses and liabilities (including but not limited to fines and
penalties) in connection with any proceeding involving the corporate agent by
reason of his being or having been such a corporate agent, other than a
proceeding by or in the right of the corporation if:

         -        such corporate agent acted in good faith and in a manner he
                  reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best
                  interests of the corporation; and

         -        with respect to any criminal proceeding, such corporate agent
                  had no reasonable cause to believe his conduct was unlawful.

Indemnification against expenses incurred by a corporate agent in connection
with a proceeding against such person for actions in such capacity is mandatory
to the extent that such person has been successful on the merits. If a corporate
agent is determined to be liable to the corporation, indemnification for
expenses is not allowable, subject to limited exceptions when a court deems the
award of expenses appropriate.

         New Jersey law grants express power to a New Jersey corporation to
purchase liability insurance for its corporate agents, regardless of whether any
such person is otherwise eligible for indemnification by the corporation.
Advancement of expenses is permitted, but a person receiving such advances must
repay those expenses if it is ultimately determined that he is not entitled to
indemnification. The indemnification and advancement of expenses provided by or
granted pursuant to New Jersey law does not exclude any other rights, including
the right to be indemnified against liabilities and expenses incurred in
proceedings by or in the right of the corporation, to which a corporate agent
may be entitled under a certificate of incorporation, bylaw, agreement, vote of
shareholders, or otherwise; provided that, under New Jersey law, no
indemnification may be made to or on behalf of a corporate agent if a judgment
or other final adjudication adverse to the corporate agent establishes that his
acts or omissions:

         -        were in breach of his duty of loyalty to the corporation or
                  its shareholders,

         -        were not in good faith or involved a knowing violation of law
                  or

         -        resulted in receipt by the corporate agent of an improper
                  personal benefit.

         AmeriSource. AmeriSource's restated bylaws provide for indemnification
of any person who is or was a director or officer of AmeriSource or a
constituent corporation or of any corporation which he served as such at the
request of AmeriSource, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law.
AmeriSource maintains insurance on behalf of its directors, officers, employees
and agents.

         Bergen. Bergen's restated certificate of incorporation provides for
indemnification of every person who is or was a director, officer, employee or
agent of Bergen, or of any corporation which he served as such at the request of
Bergen, to the fullest extent permitted by New Jersey law.

         Bergen has entered into indemnity agreements with certain of its
current and former directors which generally provide for Bergen to indemnify
such directors against liabilities and defense costs to the extent

that such directors would have been insured under the director and officer
liability insurance policies which Bergen had in effect on December 31, 1984.
Bergen's obligation to indemnify a director under such indemnity agreements is
limited to $30 million in the aggregate; however, the indemnity agreements do
not limit the directors' right to recover in excess of such $30 million maximum
from Bergen if the director is otherwise entitled to statutory indemnification.

         AmeriSource-Bergen. The amended and restated certificate of
incorporation of AmeriSource-Bergen will provide that AmeriSource-Bergen will
indemnify any person who is or was a director or officer of AmeriSource-Bergen,
or is or was serving at the request of AmeriSource-Bergen as a director, officer
or trustee of another corporation, trust or other enterprise, with respect to
actions taken or omitted by such person in any capacity in which such person
serves AmeriSource-Bergen or such other corporation, trust or other enterprise,
to the full extent authorized or permitted by law, as now or hereafter in
effect, and such right to indemnification will continue as to a person who has
ceased to be a director, officer or trustee, as the case may be, and will inure
to the benefit of such person's heirs, executors and personal and legal
representatives.

SHAREHOLDERS RIGHTS PLANS

         AmeriSource. On March 16, 2001, AmeriSource adopted a shareholder
rights plan pursuant to a rights agreement with Mellon Investor Services LLC, as
rights agent. Set forth below is a summary of the material provisions of the
rights agreement. The summary does not include a complete description of all of
the terms of the rights agreement. All AmeriSource shareholders and Bergen
shareholders are urged to read carefully the relevant provisions of
AmeriSource's rights plan, copies of which will be sent to AmeriSource's
shareholders upon request. See "Where You Can Find More Information."

         Exercisability of Rights. Under the AmeriSource rights agreement, one
right, referred to as an AmeriSource right, attaches to each share of
AmeriSource common stock outstanding and, when exercisable, entitles the
registered holder to purchase from AmeriSource one-tenth of a share of
AmeriSource Class A common stock at an initial purchase price of $20, subject to
antidilution adjustments in the event of a stock split, stock dividend or
similar transaction with respect to AmeriSource's common stock. The AmeriSource
rights will not become exercisable until the earlier of:

         -        10 business days following a public announcement that a person
                  has become the beneficial owner of 15% or more of the
                  AmeriSource common stock then outstanding; and

         -        10 business days, or such later date as may be determined by
                  the board of directors of AmeriSource, following the
                  commencement of, or the announcement of an intention to
                  commence, a tender offer or exchange offer that would result
                  in a person becoming the beneficial owner of 15% or more of
                  the AmeriSource common stock then outstanding.

The AmeriSource rights agreement provides that the AmeriSource rights will not
become exercisable solely by reason of the execution of the merger agreement,
the execution of the stock option agreement with Bergen, consummation of the
merger pursuant to the merger agreement, or the acquisition or transfer of
AmeriSource Class A common stock by Bergen pursuant to the stock option
agreement.

         "Flip In" Feature. In the event a person becomes the beneficial owner
of 15% or more of the AmeriSource common stock outstanding, each holder of an
AmeriSource right, except for such acquiring person, will have the right to
acquire, upon exercise of the AmeriSource right, instead of one-tenth of a share
of AmeriSource Class A common stock, shares of AmeriSource Class A common stock
having a value equal to twice the exercise price of the AmeriSource right. For
example, if we assume that the initial purchase price of $20 is in effect on the
date that the flip-in feature of the AmeriSource rights is exercised, any holder
of an AmeriSource right, except for the acquiring person that has become the
beneficial owner of 15% or more of the AmeriSource common stock then
outstanding, may exercise his or her AmeriSource right by

paying to AmeriSource $20 in order to receive from AmeriSource shares of
AmeriSource Class A common stock having a value equal to $40.

         "Flip Over" Feature. In the event that following a public announcement
a person has become the beneficial owner of 15% or more of the AmeriSource
common stock then outstanding:

         -        AmeriSource merges into another entity,

         -        another entity merges into AmeriSource, or

         -        AmeriSource sells more than 50% of its assets or earning
                  power,

then each holder of an AmeriSource right, except for such person that acquired
the beneficial ownership of 15% or more of the AmeriSource common stock then
outstanding, will have the right to receive, upon exercise of the AmeriSource
right, the number of shares of the acquiring company's capital stock with the
greatest voting power having a value equal to twice the exercise price of the
AmeriSource right.

         "Exchange" Feature. At any time after a person becomes the beneficial
owner of 15% or more, but less than 50%, of the AmeriSource common stock then
outstanding, the board of directors of AmeriSource may, at its option, exchange
all or part of the AmeriSource rights, except for those held by such acquiring
person, for AmeriSource Class A common stock at an exchange ratio of one-tenth
of a share of AmeriSource Class A common stock for each AmeriSource right,
subject to adjustment, and cash instead of fractional shares, if any. Use of
this exchange feature means that eligible AmeriSource rights holders would not
have to pay a purchase price before receiving shares of AmeriSource Class A
common stock but would receive substantially less shares of AmeriSource Class A
common stock than if the shareholder were to pay cash under the "Flip In"
Feature or "Flip Over" Feature.

         Redemption of Rights. At any time prior to the earlier to occur of:

         -        10 business days following a public announcement that a person
                  has become the beneficial owner of 15% or more of the
                  AmeriSource common stock then outstanding,

         -        March 16, 2002, or

         -        the consummation of the merger pursuant to the merger
                  agreement,

the board of directors of AmeriSource may redeem all of the AmeriSource rights
at a redemption price of $0.001 per right, subject to adjustment. The right to
exercise the AmeriSource rights, as described under "Rights Plan -
Exercisability of Rights," will terminate upon redemption, and at that time, the
holders of the AmeriSource rights will have the right to receive only the
redemption price for each AmeriSource right they hold.

         Amendment of Rights. At any time prior to the earlier to occur of:

         -        10 business days following a public announcement that a person
                  has become the beneficial owner of 15% or more of the
                  AmeriSource common stock then outstanding;

         -        10 business days, or such later date designated by the board
                  of directors of AmeriSource, following the commencement of, or
                  the announcement of an intention to commence, a tender offer
                  or exchange offer that would result in a person becoming the
                  beneficial owner of 15% or more of the AmeriSource common
                  stock then outstanding; and

         -        a trigger of the "Flip In" Feature or the "Flip Over" Feature;

the terms of the existing AmeriSource rights agreement may be amended by the
board of directors of AmeriSource without the approval of the holders of the
rights. However, after the date any person acquires at least 15% of
AmeriSource's outstanding common stock, the rights agreement may not be amended
in any

manner that would adversely affect the interests of the holders of the
AmeriSource rights, excluding the interests of the acquiror.

         Termination of Rights. If not previously exercised, the AmeriSource
rights will expire on the earlier of:

         -        March 16, 2002 or

         -        the consummation of the merger pursuant to the merger
                  agreement,

unless AmeriSource earlier redeems or exchanges the AmeriSource rights or
extends the expiration date as provided in the rights agreement.

         Anti-Takeover Effects. The AmeriSource rights have anti-takeover
effects. Once the AmeriSource rights have become exercisable, in most cases the
AmeriSource rights will cause substantial dilution to a person that attempts to
acquire or merge with AmeriSource. Accordingly, the existence of the
AmeriSource rights may deter potential acquirors from making a takeover proposal
or a tender offer. The AmeriSource rights should not interfere with any merger
or other business combination approved by the board of directors of AmeriSource
since AmeriSource may redeem the AmeriSource rights. The AmeriSource rights will
not interfere with the merger, as contemplated, because the AmeriSource rights
will not become exercisable solely by reason of execution of the merger
agreement or the AmeriSource stock option agreement or consummation of the
transactions contemplated thereby.

         Class A Common Stock. In connection with the creation of the
AmeriSource rights, the board of directors of AmeriSource has reserved shares of
Class A common stock of AmeriSource for issuance upon exercise of the rights.
Such shares of AmeriSource Class A common stock may only be purchased or issued
after the AmeriSource rights have become exercisable.

         Bergen. In 1994, Bergen adopted a shareholder rights plan pursuant to a
rights agreement originally with Chemical Trust Company of California
(predecessor to Mellon Investor Services LLC), as rights agent, as amended on
November 10, 1996 and August 21, 1997, as amended and restated on December 17,
1999 and as amended and restated on March 16, 2001 with Mellon Investor Services
LLC (formerly known as Chase Mellon Shareholder Services L.L.C., as successor to
Chemical Trust Company of California). Set forth below is a summary of the
material provisions of the Bergen rights agreement. The summary does not include
a complete description of all of the terms of the Bergen rights agreement. All
AmeriSource shareholders and Bergen shareholders are urged to read carefully the
relevant provisions of Bergen's rights agreement, copies of which will be sent
to Bergen shareholders upon request. See "Where You Can Find More Information."

         Exercisability of Rights. Under the Bergen rights agreement, one right,
referred to as a Bergen right, attaches to each share of Bergen common stock
outstanding and, when exercisable, entitles the registered holder to purchase
from Bergen one one-hundredth of a share of Bergen Series A junior participating
preferred stock at an initial purchase price of $80, subject to customary
antidilution adjustments.

         The Bergen rights will not become exercisable until the earlier of:

         -        10 business days following a public announcement that a person
                  has become the beneficial owner of 15% or more of the Bergen
                  common stock then outstanding; and

         -        10 business days, or such later date designated by the board
                  of directors of Bergen, following the commencement of, or the
                  announcement of an intention to commence, a tender offer or
                  exchange offer that would result in a person becoming the
                  beneficial owner of 15% or more of the Bergen common stock
                  then outstanding.

         In connection with the merger, the Bergen rights agreement was amended
to provide that the Bergen rights will not become exercisable solely by reason
of the execution of the merger agreement, or the Bergen stock option agreement
or the consummation of the transactions contemplated thereby.

         Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock. In connection with the
creation of the Bergen rights, the board of directors of Bergen authorized the
issuance of 400,000 shares of Bergen preferred stock designated as Bergen Series
A junior participating preferred stock.

         Bergen has designed the dividend, liquidation, voting and redemption
features of the Bergen Series A junior participating preferred stock so that the
value of one one-hundredth of a share of Bergen Series A junior participating
preferred stock approximates the value of one share of Bergen common stock.
Shares of Bergen Series A junior participating preferred stock may only be
purchased after the Bergen rights have become exercisable.

         "Flip In" Feature. In the event a person becomes the beneficial owner
of 15% or more of the Bergen common stock outstanding, each holder of a Bergen
right, except for a person that is the beneficial owner of 15% or more of the
Bergen common stock then outstanding, will have the right to acquire, upon
exercise of the Bergen right, instead of one one-hundredth of a share of Bergen
Series A junior participating preferred stock, shares of Bergen common stock
having a value equal to twice the exercise price of the Bergen right. For
example, if we assume that the initial purchase price of $80 is in effect on the
date that the "flip-in" feature of the Bergen right is exercised, any holder of
a Bergen right, except for the person that has become the beneficial owner of
15% or more of the outstanding Bergen common stock, may exercise his or her
Bergen right by paying to Bergen $80 in order to receive from Bergen shares of
Bergen common stock having a value equal to $160.

         "Flip Over" Feature. In the event that, following a public announcement
that a person has become the beneficial owner of 15% or more of the Bergen
common stock then outstanding:

         -        Bergen merges into an entity,

         -        another entity merges into Bergen, or

         -        Bergen sells more than 50% of its assets or earning power to a
                  person,

then each holder of a Bergen right, except for such person that is the
beneficial owner of 15% or more of the Bergen common stock then outstanding,
will have the right to receive, upon exercise of the Bergen right, the number of
shares of the acquiring company's common stock equal to twice the exercise price
of the Bergen right.

         "Exchange" Feature. At any time after a person becomes a beneficial
owner of 15% or more of the Bergen common stock then outstanding, the board of
directors of Bergen may, at its option, exchange all or some of the Bergen
rights, except for those held by such person, for consideration per Bergen right
consisting of one share of common stock that would be issuable upon exercise of
one Bergen right. Use of this exchange feature means that eligible Bergen rights
holders would not have to pay a purchase price before receiving shares of Bergen
common stock.

         Redemption of Rights. At any time prior to the earlier to occur of:

         -        10 business days following a public announcement that a person
                  has become the beneficial owner of 15% or more of the Bergen
                  common stock then outstanding, and

         -        February 18, 2004,

the board of directors of Bergen may redeem all of the Bergen rights at a
redemption price of $0.01 per right, subject to adjustment. The right to
exercise the Bergen rights, as described under "Rights Plan -

Exercisability of Rights," will terminate upon redemption, and at such time, the
holders of the Bergen rights will have the right to receive only the redemption
price for each Bergen right held.

         Amendment of Rights. At any time before the earlier of:

         -        10 business days following a public announcement that a person
                  has become the beneficial owner of 15% or more of the Bergen
                  common stock then outstanding; and

         -        10 business days, or such later date designated by the board
                  of directors of Bergen, following the commencement of, or the
                  announcement of an intention to commence, a tender offer or
                  exchange offer that would result in a person becoming the
                  beneficial owner of 15% or more of the Bergen common stock
                  then outstanding;

the terms of the existing Bergen rights agreement may be amended by the Bergen
board of directors without the approval of the holders of the rights. After such
date, the rights agreement may not be amended in any manner which would
adversely affect the interests of the holders of the Bergen rights, excluding
the interests of the acquiror.

         Termination of Rights. If not previously exercised, the Bergen rights
will expire on February 18, 2004 or upon consummation of the merger pursuant to
the merger agreement unless Bergen earlier redeems or exchanges the Bergen
rights. The Bergen rights plan will also terminate immediately prior to the
consummation of the merger.

         Anti-Takeover Effects. The Bergen rights have anti-takeover effects.
Once the Bergen rights have become exercisable, in most cases the Bergen rights
will cause substantial dilution to a person that attempts to acquire or merge
with Bergen. Accordingly, the existence of the Bergen rights may deter potential
acquirors from making a takeover proposal or a tender offer. The Bergen rights
should not interfere with any merger or other business combination approved by
the Bergen board of directors because a transaction approved by the Bergen board
of directors may not cause the Bergen rights to become exercisable and because
Bergen may redeem the rights. The Bergen rights will not interfere with the
merger, as contemplated, because the rights agreement was amended in connection
with the merger to provide that the Bergen rights will not become exercisable
solely by reason of the execution of the merger agreement or the Bergen stock
option agreement or consummation of the transactions contemplated thereby and
because the Board of Bergen has approved the merger agreement and the
transactions contemplated thereby.

         AmeriSource-Bergen. AmeriSource and Bergen intend to cause
AmeriSource-Bergen to adopt a shareholder rights plan prior to the completion of
the merger.

STATE ANTI-TAKEOVER STATUTES

         Under Delaware Law. Under the business combination statute of Delaware
law, a corporation is prohibited from engaging in any business combination with
an interested shareholder who, together with its affiliates or associates, owns,
or who became an affiliate or associate of the corporation and within a
three year period did own, 15% or more of the corporation's voting stock for a
three year period following the time the shareholder became an interested
shareholder, except under certain circumstances.

         The provisions of the Delaware business combination statute do not
apply to a corporation if, subject to certain requirements, the certificate of
incorporation or bylaws of the corporation contain a provision expressly
electing not to be governed by the provisions of the statute or the corporation
does not have voting stock listed on a national securities exchange, authorized
for quotation on an inter-dealer quotation system of a registered national
securities association or held of record by more than 2,000 shareholders.

         Under New Jersey Law. The New Jersey's Shareholders' Protection Act
provides generally that no public corporation organized under the laws of New
Jersey with its principal executive offices or significant operations located in
New Jersey may engage in any business combination with any "interested
shareholder" (generally, a 10% or greater shareholder) of such corporation for a
period of five years following such shareholders becoming an "interested
shareholder", unless such business combination is approved by the board of
directors of such corporation prior to such shareholder becoming an "interested
shareholder". A resident public corporation organized under the laws of New
Jersey with its principal executive offices or significant operations located in
New Jersey cannot opt out of the foregoing provisions of New Jersey's
shareholders' protection statute.

         In addition, no resident public corporation organized under the laws of
New Jersey with its principal executive offices or significant operations
located in New Jersey may engage, at any time, in any business combination with
any interested shareholder of such corporation other than:

         -        a business combination approved by the board of directors of
                  such corporation prior to such shareholder becoming an
                  "interested shareholder",

         -        a business combination approved by the affirmative vote of the
                  holders of two-thirds of the voting stock not beneficially
                  owned by such interested shareholder at a meeting called for
                  such purpose, or

         -        a business combination in which the interested shareholder
                  pays a formula price designed to ensure that all other
                  shareholders receive at least the highest price per share paid
                  by such interested shareholder.

         AmeriSource. AmeriSource's restated certificate of incorporation
excludes AmeriSource from the restrictions imposed under the business
combination statute of Delaware law.

         Bergen. The approval of the Bergen stock option agreement, under which
Bergen granted to AmeriSource an irrevocable option, excludes any purchase by
AmeriSource of Bergen common stock under the stock option agreement from the
operation of the New Jersey Shareholders' Protection Act.

         AmeriSource-Bergen. AmeriSource-Bergen's amended and restated
certificate of incorporation will provide that the business combination statute
of Delaware will apply to AmeriSource-Bergen.

                 MANAGEMENT AND DIRECTORS OF AMERISOURCE-BERGEN
                                AFTER THE MERGER

BOARD OF DIRECTORS OF AMERISOURCE-BERGEN

         Members of the AmeriSource-Bergen Board of Directors.

         Upon completion of the merger, the board of directors of
AmeriSource-Bergen will initially be comprised of eight individuals:

         -        one of whom will be Robert E. Martini, the current Chairman
                  and Chief Executive Officer of Bergen,

         -        one of whom will be R. David Yost, the current Chairman and
                  Chief Executive Officer of AmeriSource,

         -        three of whom will be independent directors of Bergen
                  immediately prior to the merger designated by Bergen, and

         -        three of whom will be independent directors of AmeriSource
                  immediately prior to the merger designated by AmeriSource.

To be eligible to be classified as an independent director of AmeriSource or
Bergen, such director is prohibited from being a current officer or having been
an officer within the past three years of AmeriSource, Bergen or any of their
subsidiaries. It is the intention of AmeriSource and Bergen that, prior to or as
soon as possible after the merger, the board of directors of AmeriSource-Bergen
will be expanded to ten persons and will add two more independent directors to
be designated jointly by AmeriSource and Bergen. To be eligible to be classified
as an independent director jointly designated by AmeriSource or Bergen, such
director is prohibited from being a current or former director or officer of
AmeriSource, Bergen or any of their subsidiaries. Upon completion of the merger,
the directors of AmeriSource-Bergen will be divided into three classes
consisting of two, three and three directors, respectively. If the two
independent directors to be designated jointly by AmeriSource and Bergen are
added to the board of directors, then the directors of AmeriSource-Bergen will
be divided into three classes consisting of three, three and four directors,
respectively. The initial terms of AmeriSource-Bergen's directors will expire in
2002, 2003, and 2004 depending on the class in which the director is placed.

Board of Directors and Stockholders
AmeriSource-Bergen Corporation

         We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheet of
AmeriSource-Bergen Corporation (the "Company") as of March 31, 2001. This
balance sheet is the responsibility of the Company's management. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on this balance sheet based on our
audit.

         We conducted our audit in accordance with auditing standards generally
accepted in the United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform
the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the balance sheet is free
of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence
supporting the amounts and disclosures in the balance sheet. An audit also
includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made
by management, as well as evaluating the overall balance sheet presentation. We
believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

         In our opinion, the balance sheet referred to above presents fairly, in
all material respects, the consolidated balance sheet of AmeriSource-Bergen
Corporation as of March 31, 2001, in conformity with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States.

                       NOTE TO CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET

NOTE 1. ORGANIZATION AND BASIS OF PRESENTATION

         AmeriSource-Bergen Corporation (formerly AABB Corporation) (the
"Company") was incorporated in the state of Delaware on March 16, 2001. The
Company was formed in connection with the contemplated merger (the "Merger") of
AmeriSource Health Corporation ("AmeriSource") and Bergen Brunswig Corporation
("Bergen"). Upon completion of the Merger, AmeriSource and Bergen will each
become a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company. Other than its formation, to
date the Company and its subsidiaries have not conducted any activities.

         The consolidated balance sheet includes the accounts of the Company and
its two wholly-owned subsidiaries, A-Sub Acquisition Corp. and B-Sub Acquisition
Corp. Intercompany accounts have been eliminated.

         The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make
estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated
balance sheet.

Item 20. Indemnification of Directors and Officers.

("Delaware Corporation Law") provides, in general, that a corporation shall have
the power to indemnify any person who was or is a party or is threatened to be
made a party to any threatened, pending or completed action, suit or proceeding,
whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative (other than an action
by or in the right of the corporation), because the person is or was a director
or officer of the corporation. Such indemnity may be against expenses (including
attorneys' fees), judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement actually and
reasonably incurred by the person in connection with such action, suit or
proceeding, if the person acted in good faith and in a manner the person
reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the
corporation and if, with respect to any criminal action or proceeding, the
person did not have reasonable cause to believe the person's conduct was
unlawful.

         Section 145(b) of the Delaware Corporation Law provides, in general,
that a corporation shall have the power to indemnify any person who was or is a
party or is threatened to be made a party to any threatened, pending or
completed action or suit by or in the right of the corporation to procure a
judgment in its favor because the person is or was a director or officer of the
corporation, against any expenses (including attorneys' fees) actually and
reasonably incurred by the person in connection with the defense or settlement
of such action or suit if the person acted in good faith and in a manner the
person reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the
corporation, except that no indemnification shall be made in respect of any
claim, issue or matter as to which such person shall have been adjudged to be
liable to the corporation unless and only to the extent that the Court of
Chancery or the court in which such action or suit was brought shall determine
upon application that, despite the adjudication of liability but in view of all
the circumstances of the case, such person is fairly and reasonably entitled to
indemnity for such expenses which the Court of Chancery or such other court
shall deem proper.

         Section 145(g) of the Delaware Corporation Law provides, in general,
that a corporation shall have the power to purchase and maintain insurance on
behalf of any person who is or was a director or officer of the corporation
against any liability asserted against the person in any such capacity, or
arising out of the person's status as such, whether or not the corporation would
have the power to indemnify the person against such liability under the
provisions of the law.

         Article VII of the Registrant's Amended and Restated Certificate of
Incorporation requires indemnification to the fullest extent permitted under
Delaware law for any person who is or was a director or officer of the
Registrant who is or was involved or threatened to be made so involved in any
proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, by reason
of the fact that such person is or was serving as a director, officer, employee
or agent of the Registrant or was serving at the request of the Registrant as a
director, officer, employee or agent of any other enterprise.

         The foregoing statements are subject to the detailed provisions of
Section 145 of the Delaware Corporation Law and Article VII of the Amended and
Restated Certificate of Incorporation of the Registrant.

Item 22. Undertakings

                                      II-2

         The undersigned Registrant hereby undertakes:

                           (1)      that, for purposes of determining any
         liability under the Securities Act of 1933, each filing of the
         registrant's annual report pursuant to Section 13(a) or Section 15(d)
         of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (and, where applicable, each
         filing of an employee benefit plan's annual report pursuant to Section
         15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) that is incorporated by
         reference in this registration statement shall be deemed to be a new
         registration statement relating to the securities offered therein, and
         the offering of such securities at that time shall be deemed to be the
         initial bona fide offering thereof;

                           (2)      that prior to any public reoffering of the
         securities registered hereunder through use of a prospectus which is a
         part of this registration statement, by any person or party who is
         deemed to be an underwriter within the meaning of Rule 145(c), the
         issuer undertakes that such reoffering prospectus will contain the
         information called for by the applicable registration form with respect
         to reofferings by persons who may be deemed underwriters, in addition
         to the information called for by the other items of the applicable
         form;

                           (3)      that every prospectus (i) that is filed
         pursuant to paragraph (2) immediately preceding, or (ii) that purports
         to meet the requirements of Section 10(a)(3) of the Act and is used in
         connection with an offering of securities subject to Rule 415, will be
         filed as a part of an amendment to the registration statement and will
         not be used until such amendment is effective, and that, for purposes
         of determining any liability under the Securities Act of 1933, each
         such post-effective amendment shall be deemed to be a new registration
         statement relating to the securities offered therein, and the offering
         of such securities at that time shall be deemed to be the initial bona
         fide offering thereof;

                           (4)      to respond to requests for information that
         is incorporated by reference into the prospectus pursuant to Items 4,
         10(b), 11, or 13 of this Form, within one business day of receipt of
         any such request, and to send the incorporated documents by first class
         mail or other equally prompt means, including information contained in
         documents filed after the effective date of this registration statement
         through the date of responding to such request; and

                           (5)      to supply by means of a post-effective
         amendment all information concerning a transaction, and the company
         being acquired involved therein, that was not the subject of and
         included in this registration statement when it became effective.

         Insofar as indemnification for liabilities under the Securities Act of
1933 may be permitted to directors, officers and controlling persons of the
registrant pursuant to the provisions described in Item 20 above, the registrant
has been informed that in the opinion of the Securities and Exchange Commission
such indemnification is against public policy as expressed in the Securities Act
and is therefore unenforceable. If a claim of indemnification against such
liabilities (other than the payment by the registrant of expenses incurred or
paid by a director, officer or controlling person of the registrant in a
successful defense of any action, suit or proceeding) is asserted by such
director, officer, or controlling person in connection with the securities being
registered, the registrant will, unless in the opinion of its counsel the matter
has been settled by controlling precedent, submit to a court of appropriate
jurisdiction the question whether such indemnification by it is against public
policy as expressed in the Securities Act and will be governed by the final
adjudication of such issue.

                                      II-3

                                   SIGNATURES

Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Act, the registrant has duly
caused this registration statement to be signed on its behalf by the
undersigned, thereunto duly authorized, in the City of Chesterbrook,
Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, on May 23, 2001.
