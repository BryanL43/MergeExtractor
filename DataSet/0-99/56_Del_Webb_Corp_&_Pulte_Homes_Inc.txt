Dear Fellow Stockholder:

You are cordially invited to attend a special meeting of
stockholders of Del Webb Corporation to be held at the Arizona
Biltmore Resort Hotel, 2400 East Missouri, Phoenix, Arizona
85016, on Friday, July 27, 2001, at 9 a.m. local time.

At the special meeting, we will ask you to vote on the
acquisition of the outstanding shares of Del Webb common stock
by Pulte Homes, Inc. through a merger of Del Webb with a
subsidiary of Pulte. Following the merger, Del Webb will be a
wholly owned subsidiary of Pulte.

If the merger is completed, each outstanding share of Del Webb
common stock will be converted into Pulte common shares. The
exact number of Pulte common shares you will receive will be
based on the average last sale price of Pulte common shares for
the 15 trading days ending on, and including, the third trading
day prior to the special meeting. The following table shows the
number of Pulte common shares that you will receive for each
share of Del Webb common stock, based on the average last sale
price of Pulte common shares:

Average Last Sale Price

Pulte Common Shares

of a Pulte Common Share

Issued for Each Del Webb Share

$45.04 or higher

0.866 shares

$39.00 to $45.03

Fraction of a share having a calculated value
	(using the average last sale price) of $39.00

$33.00 to $38.99

1.0 share

$30.00 to $32.99

Shares having a calculated value (using the
	average last sale price) of $33.00

Less than $30.00

1.1 shares

In the event that the average last sale price of a Pulte common
share is less than $27.00, Del Webb may terminate the merger
agreement. The market value of the Pulte common shares that you
receive upon completion of the merger may be greater or less
than the calculated value.

Your board of directors, with two directors dissenting and one
director absent, has determined that the merger agreement is
fair to and in the best interests of Del Webb and its
stockholders and recommends that you vote 
FOR
 approval
and adoption of the merger agreement and the transactions
contemplated by the merger agreement.

The accompanying Joint Proxy Statement/ Prospectus provides
detailed information about the proposed merger. We encourage you
to read carefully the entire document, including the annexes.

Whether or not you plan to attend the special meeting, please
take the time to vote by completing and mailing your proxy card
in the enclosed envelope as promptly as possible so that your
shares will be voted at the special meeting. This will not limit
your right to vote in person or to attend the special meeting.

Please do not send your common stock certificates at this time.
If the merger is completed, you will be sent instructions
regarding the exchange of your certificates.

	Very truly yours,

	LEROY C. HANNEMAN, JR.

Pulte Homes, Inc.  Del Webb
Corporation

Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus

Merger Proposed: Your Vote is Important

The boards of directors of Pulte Homes, Inc. and Del Webb
Corporation have approved the acquisition of the outstanding
shares of Del Webb common stock by Pulte. Pursuant to the terms
of a merger agreement which was signed on April 30, 2001, a
wholly owned subsidiary of Pulte will merge into Del Webb. As a
result, Del Webb will become a wholly owned subsidiary of Pulte.
In order to complete the merger, both companies must obtain the
approval of their shareholders.

If the merger is completed, each outstanding share of Del Webb
common stock will be converted into Pulte common shares. The
exact number of Pulte common shares a Del Webb stockholder will
receive will be based on the average last sale price of Pulte
common shares for the 15 trading days ending on, and including,
the third trading day prior to the Del Webb special meeting. The
following table shows the number of Pulte common shares that a
Del Webb stockholder will receive for each share of Del Webb
common stock, based on the average last sale price of Pulte
common shares:

Average Last Sale Price

Pulte Common Shares

of a Pulte Common Share

Issued for Each Del Webb Share

$45.04 or higher

0.866 shares

$39.00 to $45.03

Fraction of a share having a calculated value
	(using the average last sale price) of $39.00

$33.00 to $38.99

1.0 share

$30.00 to $32.99

Shares having a calculated value (using the
	average last sale price) of $33.00

Less than $30.00

1.1 shares

In the event that the average last sale price of a Pulte common
share is less than $27.00, Del Webb may terminate the merger
agreement. The market value of the Pulte common shares that a
Del Webb stockholder receives upon completion of the merger may
be greater or less than the calculated value.

We cannot complete the transaction unless, among other things,
(1) Pultes shareholders approve the issuance of Pulte
common shares to holders of Del Webb common stock in connection
with the merger and upon exercise of Del Webb options which
remain outstanding after completion of the merger and
(2) Del Webbs stockholders approve and adopt the
merger agreement and the transactions contemplated by the merger
agreement. Special meetings of the shareholders of Pulte and Del
Webb will be held on Friday, July 27, 2001, to vote on
these matters.

The Pulte board of directors has approved the merger and the
issuance of Pulte common shares in connection with the merger
and recommends that the holders of Pulte common shares vote FOR
the share issuance.

The Del Webb board of directors, with two directors
dissenting and one director absent, has determined that the
merger agreement is fair to and in the best interests of Del
Webb and its stockholders and recommends that Del Webb
stockholders vote FOR approval and adoption of the merger
agreement and the transactions contemplated by the merger
agreement.

Approval of the share issuance by Pulte shareholders requires
the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the
outstanding Pulte common shares that vote, in person or by
proxy, on the proposal at the special meeting, provided that a
quorum exists.

Approval of the merger agreement and the transactions
contemplated by the merger agreement by Del Webb stockholders
requires the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of
the outstanding shares of Del Webb common stock. 
Because
approval requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the

outstanding Del Webb shares, failure to vote is the same
as a vote against the merger.
 Therefore, it is very
important that all Del Webb stockholders vote with regard to the
merger.

This Joint Proxy Statement/ Prospectus provides Pulte
shareholders and Del Webb stockholders with detailed information
about the proposed merger and also constitutes the prospectus of
Pulte with respect to its common shares to be issued to the
stockholders of Del Webb in connection with the merger. We
encourage you to read this entire document carefully.

On April 30, 2001, the day before the transaction between
Pulte and Del Webb was announced, the last sale price of Pulte
common shares, which are traded on the New York Stock Exchange
under the symbol PHM, was $46.78. On the same day,
the last sale price of Del Webb common stock, which is traded on
the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol WBB,
was $33.80. On June 22, 2001, the last sale price of Pulte
common shares reported on the New York Stock Exchange composite
tape was $40.56 per share, and the last sale price of Del
Webb common stock reported on the New York Stock Exchange
composite tape was $37.80 per share.

All information contained in this Joint Proxy Statement/
Prospectus with respect to Pulte has been provided by Pulte. All
information contained in this Joint Proxy Statement/ Prospectus
with respect to Del Webb has been provided by Del Webb.

For risk factors involved in the transaction to which you may
want to give particular consideration, see the section of this
Joint Proxy Statement/ Prospectus captioned Risk
Factors.

The Pulte common shares to be issued pursuant to this Joint
Proxy Statement/ Prospectus have not been approved or
disapproved by the Securities and Exchange Commission or any
state securities commission, nor has the Securities and Exchange
Commission or any state securities commission passed upon the
accuracy or adequacy of this Joint Proxy Statement/ Prospectus.
Any representation to the contrary is a criminal offense.

This Joint Proxy Statement/ Prospectus is dated June 25,
2001, and is first being mailed to holders of Del Webb common
stock and Pulte common shares on or about June 28, 2001.

QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS ABOUT THE MERGER

Q:

What will happen in the proposed transaction?

A:

	Del Webb common stock will be converted into Pulte common
	shares, and Del Webb will become a wholly owned subsidiary of
	Pulte. Outstanding Pulte common shares will remain Pulte common
	shares.

Q:

Why are Pulte and Del Webb merging? How will I benefit?

A:

	Pulte believes its shareholders will benefit as a result of the
	combined companys strengthened position in existing
	homebuilding markets, broader product offering and increased
	efficiencies and cost savings.

	Del Webb believes that its stockholders will enjoy the same
	benefits as Pulte shareholders from the merger and may also
	realize other benefits by virtue of the merger, as described in
	this Joint Proxy Statement/ Prospectus.

Q:

When do you expect to complete the merger?

A:

	We are working to complete the merger as quickly as possible.
	Currently, we expect to complete the merger during the third
	calendar quarter of this year.

Q:

As a Del Webb stockholder, will my rights be different when I
	become a Pulte shareholder?

A:

	Yes. Del Webb is a Delaware corporation and Pulte is a Michigan
	corporation, each with different charter documents and by-laws.

Q:

What do I do to vote?

A:

	After reading this Joint Proxy Statement/ Prospectus, you should
	fill out and sign your proxy card. Then mail your signed proxy
	card in the enclosed return envelope as soon as possible so that
	your shares will be represented at the meeting.

Q:

What happens if I dont return a proxy card or vote at
	the meeting?

A:

	As a Pulte shareholder, while returning your proxy counts for
	purposes of establishing a quorum, failing to return your proxy
	card or vote in person at the meeting will not affect the
	determination of the number of votes for or against the issuance
	of Pulte common shares in connection with the merger.

	As a Del Webb stockholder, because a majority of the outstanding
	shares is required to approve the merger, failure to return your
	proxy card or vote in person at the meeting will have the same
	effect as voting against approval of the merger.

Q:

May I vote in person?

A:

	Yes. You may attend the meeting and vote your shares in person,
	whether or not you have sent in a proxy card.

Q:

Can I revoke my proxy after I have mailed my signed proxy
	card?

A:

	Yes. You can revoke your proxy at any time before your proxy is
	voted at the applicable special meeting. You can do that by:

 

	attending the applicable special meeting 
and 
voting in
	person;

 

	completing, signing and mailing in a new proxy card (in time so
	that the new proxy card is received prior to the special
	meeting); or

 

	sending a written notice to the applicable Corporate Secretary
	at the address specified below stating that you are revoking
	your proxy (in time so that the notice is received prior to the
	special meeting):

Pulte Shareholders:

Pulte Homes, Inc.

	33 Bloomfield Hills Parkway

	Suite 200

	Bloomfield Hills, MI 48304-2946

	Attn: Corporate Secretary

Del Webb Stockholders:

Del Webb Corporation

	6001 North 24th Street

	Phoenix, AZ 85016-2021

	Attn: Corporate Secretary

Q:

If my shares are held in street name, will my
	broker vote them for me?

A:

	Only if you instruct your broker how to vote. Your broker cannot
	vote your shares without your instruction.

 

	For Pulte shareholders, if you fail to provide your broker with
	instructions, your shares will not be represented in determining
	the number of votes for or against approval of the issuance of
	Pulte common shares in connection with the merger.

 

	For Del Webb stockholders, if you fail to provide your broker
	with instructions, it will have the same effect as a vote
	against approval of the merger.

	Abstentions and broker non-votes, however, will be included in
	the determination of shares present at the Pulte and Del Webb
	special meetings for purposes of determining whether a quorum is
	present. A broker non-vote occurs on an item when a broker is
	not permitted to vote on that item without instruction from the
	beneficial owner of the shares and no instruction is given.

Q:

What does it mean if I get more than one proxy card?

A:

	You may own both Pulte and Del Webb shares, or your shares may
	be registered in different names or at different addresses or
	may be in more than one account. Sign and return all proxy cards
	to be sure that all your Pulte and Del Webb shares are voted.

Q:

What will I receive in the merger?

A:

	For Pulte shareholders, each Pulte common share and each option
	to purchase Pulte common shares will remain outstanding and
	unchanged.

	For Del Webb stockholders, if the merger is completed, each
	outstanding share of Del Webb common stock will be converted
	into Pulte common shares. The exact number of Pulte common
	shares a Del Webb stockholder will receive will be based on the
	average last sale price of Pulte common shares for the 15
	trading days ending on, and including, the third trading day
	prior to the Del Webb special meeting. The following table shows
	the number of Pulte common shares that a Del Webb stockholder
	will receive for each share of Del Webb common stock, based on
	the average last sale price of Pulte common shares:

Average Last Sale Price

Pulte Common Shares

of a Pulte Common Share

Issued for Each Del Webb Share

Q:

Should I send in my stock certificates now?

A:

	No. Neither Pulte shareholders nor Del Webb stockholders
	should take any action with respect to their stock certificates
	at this time. For Del Webb stockholders, once the merger is
	completed, Del Webb stock certificates will represent Pulte
	share certificates until exchanged. After the merger is
	completed, we will send you written instructions on how to
	exchange your Del Webb stock certificates for Pulte share
	certificates.

Q:

Will I have dissenters rights?

A:

	No. Del Webb and Pulte shareholders are not entitled to
	dissenters or appraisal rights in connection with the
	merger.

Q:

Will Del Webb stockholders be taxed as a result of the
	merger?

A:

	Pulte and Del Webb expect that, in general, Del Webb
	stockholders will not recognize gain or loss for United States
	federal income tax purposes as a result of the merger, except
	for gain or loss attributable to cash received by Del Webb
	stockholders instead of fractional shares. It is a condition to
	the merger that Del Webb receive a legal opinion to the effect
	that the merger will constitute a reorganization
	within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Internal
	Revenue Code of 1986, as amended.

	 The tax consequences of the merger to you will depend on your
	own situation. Del Webb stockholders should consult their tax
	advisors for a full understanding of these tax consequences.

Will the Pulte board of directors change as a result of the
	merger?

A:

	Yes. Three Del Webb directors will join the Pulte board upon
	completion of the merger.

originate mortgage loans for the benefit of our domestic home
buyers and we package and resell mortgage loans and perform
mortgage loan servicing activities. In addition, our
non-operating corporate segment supports the operations of our
subsidiaries as the internal source of financing, develops and
implements strategic initiatives centered around new business

The Merger Consideration 
(see page 41)

If the merger is completed, each outstanding share of Del Webb
common stock will be converted into Pulte common shares. The
exact number of Pulte common shares a Del Webb stockholder will
receive will be based on the average last sale price of Pulte
common shares for the 15 trading days ending on, and including,
the third trading day prior to the Del Webb special meeting. The
following table shows the

number of Pulte common shares that a Del Webb stockholder will
receive for each share of Del Webb common stock, based on the
average last sale price of Pulte common shares:

Average Last Sale Price

Pulte Common Shares

of a Pulte Common Share

Issued for Each Del Webb Share

$45.04 or higher

0.866 shares

$39.00 to $45.03

Fraction of a share having a calculated value
	(using the average last sale price) of $39.00

$33.00 to $38.99

1.0 share

$30.00 to $32.99

Shares having a calculated value (using the
	average last sale price) of $33.00

Less than $30.00

1.1 shares

In the event that the average last sale price of a Pulte common
share is less than $27.00, Del Webb may terminate the merger
agreement. The market value of the Pulte common shares that a
Del Webb stockholder receives upon completion of the merger may
be greater or less than the calculated value.

Recommendation of the Pulte Board of Directors 
(see page
23)

The Pulte board has approved the merger and the issuance of
Pulte common shares in connection with the merger and recommends
that the holders of Pulte common shares vote 
FOR
 the
share issuance.

Recommendation of the Del Webb Board of Directors 
(see
page 24)

The Del Webb board of directors, with two directors dissenting
and one director absent, has determined that the merger
agreement is fair to and in the best interests of Del Webb and
its stockholders and recommends that Del Webb stockholders vote

FOR
 approval and adoption of the merger agreement and the
transactions contemplated by the merger agreement.

Pultes Reasons for the Merger 
(see page 23)

The Pulte board of directors considered a number of factors in
determining that the acquisition of the outstanding shares of
Del Webb common stock through a merger of Del Webb with a wholly
owned subsidiary of Pulte is fair to Pulte.

Del Webbs Reasons for the Merger 
(see page 24)

The Del Webb board of directors considered, with the assistance
of management and its financial and legal advisors, a number of
both positive and negative factors in approving the merger
agreement and the transactions contemplated by the merger
agreement.

Required Vote 
(see pages 17 and 18)

Pulte.  
The affirmative vote of holders of a
majority of the outstanding Pulte common shares that vote, in
person or by proxy, at the special meeting (provided that a
quorum of a majority of the outstanding Pulte common shares is
present) is required for the approval of the issuance of Pulte
common shares in connection with the merger.

William J. Pulte and certain affiliated family trusts,
which are collectively the beneficial owners as of the record
date of approximately 26% of the outstanding Pulte common
shares, have entered into a voting agreement with Del Webb,
agreeing, among other things, to vote their shares in favor of
the issuance of Pulte common shares in connection with the
merger.

On the record date, Pultes directors, executive officers
and their affiliates beneficially owned approximately 12,888,759
Pulte common shares. Of those shares, Pultes directors,
executive officers and their affiliates were entitled to vote
approximately 10,988,785 Pulte common shares, which represented

approximately 26% of the total amount of Pulte common shares
outstanding and entitled to vote on that date. There is no
agreement or arrangement regarding voting by Pultes
directors or executive officers other than William J. Pulte.

Del Webb.  
The affirmative vote, in person or by
proxy, of the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of
Del Webb common stock as of the record date is required for the
approval and adoption of the merger agreement and the
transactions contemplated by the merger agreement.

On the record date, Del Webbs directors, executive
officers and their affiliates beneficially owned
1,871,339 shares of Del Webb common stock. Of those shares,
Del Webbs directors, executive officers and their
affiliates were entitled to vote 1,002,333 shares of Del
Webb common stock, which represented approximately 5% of the
total amount of Del Webb common stock outstanding and entitled
to vote on that date. There is no agreement or arrangement
regarding voting by Del Webbs directors or executive
officers.

Opinion of Pultes Financial Advisor 
(see page 26)

In connection with the merger, the Pulte board received an
opinion from Salomon Smith Barney Inc., Pultes financial
advisor, as to the fairness, from a financial point of view, to
Pulte of the exchange ratio provided for in the merger
agreement. The full text of Salomon Smith Barneys written
opinion, dated April 30, 2001, is attached to this Joint
Proxy Statement/ Prospectus as Annex II. We encourage you
to read this opinion carefully in its entirety for a description
of the procedures followed, assumptions made, matters considered
and limitations on the review undertaken. 
Salomon Smith
Barneys opinion is addressed to the Pulte board of
directors and does not constitute a recommendation to any
shareholder with respect to any matter relating to the
merger.

Opinion of Del Webbs Financial Advisor 
(see page 30)

opinion from Credit Suisse First Boston Corporation, Del
Webbs financial advisor, as to the fairness, from a
financial point of view, to the Del Webb stockholders of the
exchange ratio provided for in the merger agreement. The full
text of Credit Suisse First Bostons written opinion, dated
April 30, 2001, is attached to this Joint Proxy Statement/
Prospectus as Annex III. We encourage you to read this
opinion carefully in its entirety for a description of the
procedures followed, assumptions made, matters considered and
limitations on the review undertaken. 
Credit Suisse First
Bostons opinion is addressed to the Del Webb board of
directors and does not constitute a recommendation to any
stockholder with respect to any matter relating to the
merger.

Ownership and Board Composition of Pulte After the Merger

(see page 48)

Pulte estimates that the number of Pulte common shares issued to
Del Webb stockholders in the merger will constitute between 27%
and 33% of the outstanding common shares of Pulte after the
merger. Three Del Webb directors will join the Pulte board of
directors upon completion of the merger.

No Dissenters or Appraisal Rights 
(see page 38)

Del Webb stockholders and Pulte shareholders are not entitled to
dissenters or appraisal rights in connection with the
merger.

Terms and Conditions of the Merger Agreement 
(see page 40)

The merger agreement has customary representations, warranties,
covenants and conditions for transactions of this type,
including the right of Del Webb to terminate the merger
agreement upon payment of a fee to Pulte under specified
circumstances.

Comparative Rights of Shareholders 
(see page 57)

If the merger is completed, the stockholders of Del Webb will
become shareholders of Pulte. The Articles of Incorporation and
By-Laws of Pulte and the Michigan Business Corporation Act will
govern the rights of all of Pultes shareholders, including
the former Del Webb stockholders, whose rights are currently
governed by Delaware law.

United States Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger

(see page 64)

Pulte and Del Webb have structured the merger so that, in
general, Del Webb, Pulte and their respective shareholders will
not recognize gain or loss for United States federal income tax
purposes in the merger, except with respect to cash received by
Del Webb stockholders instead of fractional shares. It is a
condition to the merger that Del Webb receive a legal opinion to
this effect.

Interests of Certain Persons in the Merger 
(see page 35)

In considering the recommendation of the Del Webb board of
directors that Del Webb stockholders vote in favor of the merger
agreement and the transactions contemplated by the merger
agreement, Del Webb stockholders should be aware that some Del
Webb directors and executive officers may have interests in the
merger that are in addition to the interests of Del Webb
stockholders generally. The Del Webb board of directors was
aware of, and considered, these interests in approving the
merger agreement and the transactions contemplated by the merger
agreement.

RISK FACTORS

You should carefully consider the following risk factors in
evaluating whether to vote in favor of the merger. You should
also read the documents incorporated by reference in this Joint
Proxy Statement/ Prospectus.

The value of the merger consideration a Del Webb stockholder
will receive will depend on the market value of Pulte common
shares.

If the merger is completed, each outstanding share of Del Webb
common stock will be converted into the right to receive between
0.866 and 1.1 Pulte common shares. The exact number of
Pulte common shares a Del Webb stockholder will receive will be
based upon the average last sale price of Pulte common shares
for the 15 trading days ending on, and including, the third
trading date prior to the Del Webb special meeting. Accordingly,
Del Webb stockholders will not know the exact number of Pulte
common shares they will receive in the merger until the end of
the third trading day before the Del Webb special meeting. In
addition, the market value of the Pulte common shares that a Del
Webb stockholder receives upon completion of the merger may be
greater or less than the average last sale price used for
purposes of setting the exchange ratio.

Pulte may have difficulty integrating Del Webb.

Del Webb is a large company. It is engaged in some aspects of
the homebuilding business (such as developing large-scale master
planned communities and building homes targeted at the
retirement and active adult markets) in which Pulte has
relatively limited experience, and in some locations in which
Pulte has not previously had homebuilding operations. Pulte
views this as an opportunity and a potential benefit of the
acquisition of Del Webb. However, if Pulte is unable to
integrate Del Webbs activities, management and corporate
culture with its own, Pulte could lose much of the anticipated
benefit of the merger.

Pulte and Del Webb will remain subject to risks inherent in
the homebuilding industry.

In addition to the risks relating to the merger, homebuilders
are subject to various risks inherent to the nature of the
business or outside of the control of the homebuilder. Some of
the risks include, but are not limited to, the following:

 

	the cyclical nature of the homebuilding industry and changes in
	supply and demand;

 

	changes in economic conditions and interest rates and their
	effect on the availability and cost of mortgage financing;

 

	the availability and cost of labor and materials;

 

	weather conditions and natural disasters such as earthquakes,
	floods, tornadoes, hurricanes, severe winters and significant
	rainfall;

 

	changes in government regulations and environmental
	considerations affecting the homebuilding industry;

 

	ability to access additional capital to fund future growth;

 

	the possibility that insurance will not cover legal claims
	arising in the ordinary course of business, including claims for
	construction defects;

 

	the ability to purchase suitable land at acceptable prices and
	entitle land for development;

 

	the ability to market and develop future communities and enter
	into new geographic markets; and

 

	other risks described in this Joint Proxy Statement/ Prospectus
	and in Pultes and Del Webbs filings with the
	Securities and Exchange Commission from time to time.

Forward-looking statements may prove inaccurate.

Pulte and Del Webb each have made forward-looking statements in
this Joint Proxy Statement/ Prospectus. By their nature,
forward-looking statements are subject to risks and
uncertainties. There are many factors which could affect the
combined Pulte and Del Webb in the future, and could cause
events to occur which were not anticipated in the
forward-looking statements in this Joint Proxy Statement/
Prospectus. For additional information regarding forward-looking
statements, see the section captioned The
Merger  Forward-Looking Statements.

THE SPECIAL MEETINGS

We are sending you this Joint Proxy Statement/ Prospectus in
order to provide you with important information regarding
Pultes acquisition of the outstanding shares of Del Webb
common stock and in connection with the solicitation of proxies
by the respective boards of directors of Pulte and Del Webb for
use at the special meetings of shareholders described below.
This Joint Proxy Statement/ Prospectus also constitutes the
prospectus of Pulte with respect to the Pulte common shares to
be issued to the stockholders of Del Webb in connection
with the merger.

The Pulte Special Meeting

Time, Place and Purpose of the Meeting.  
The Pulte
meeting is scheduled to be held on Friday, July 27, 2001,
at 9 a.m. local time, at the Michigan State University
Management Education Center, Room 104, 811 West Square
Lake Road, Troy, Michigan. The only matter scheduled to come
before the meeting is the proposal to approve the issuance of
Pulte common shares in connection with the merger.

Pulte knows of no other matter to be brought before the Pulte
special meeting. If any other business should properly come
before the Pulte special meeting, the persons named in the proxy
card will vote in their discretion on such matter.

Board of Directors Recommendation.  
The Pulte board
of directors has approved the merger and the issuance of Pulte
common shares in connection with the merger and recommends that
the holders of Pulte common shares vote FOR the share issuance.

Record Date.  
The board of directors of Pulte has
fixed the close of business on June 27, 2001, as the record
date for the determination of shareholders entitled to vote at
the special meeting or any adjournments or postponements of the

on the record date are entitled to notice of and to vote at the
special meeting. On the record date, 42,043,320 Pulte common
shares were outstanding and entitled to vote at the special
meeting.

Quorum.  
The presence, in person or by proxy, of the
holders of a majority of the outstanding Pulte common shares is
required to constitute a quorum at the meeting. Shares
represented by proxies which indicate the shareholders want to
abstain will be treated as being present for the purpose of
determining the presence of a quorum, but will not be voted with
regard to the proposals at the special meeting. If a broker
indicates on a proxy that it does not have authority to vote
certain shares, those shares will not be considered as present.
To the extent a proxy does not indicate that a broker does not
have authority to vote the shares to which the proxy relates,
those shares will be considered present even if the broker
states they are not to be voted with regard to the transaction
between Pulte and Del Webb.

If a quorum is not present, the shareholders present, by vote of
a majority of the votes cast by shareholders who are present, in
person or by proxy, may adjourn the meeting, and any business
which might have been transacted at the special meeting as
originally called may be transacted at the adjourned meeting.
Proxies to be voted against a specific proposal may not be used
to vote for an adjournment of the special meeting for the
purpose of soliciting additional votes in favor of that proposal.

Vote Required at the Pulte Special Meeting.  
The
affirmative vote, in person or by proxy, of holders of a
majority of the Pulte common shares which are voted, in person
or by proxy, at a meeting in which a quorum is present is
required for approval of the issuance of Pulte common shares in
connection with the merger. The holders of Pulte common shares
will be entitled to one vote for each share they hold.

William J. Pulte, Chairman of Pultes Executive
Committee, and certain affiliated family trusts, which
shareholders collectively beneficially own approximately 26% of
the outstanding Pulte common shares as of the record date, have
entered into a voting agreement with Del Webb providing that
they will vote in favor of the approval of the issuance of Pulte
common shares in connection with the merger.

Shareholdings.  
On the record date, Pultes
directors, executive officers and their affiliates beneficially
owned approximately 12,888,759 Pulte common shares. Of those
shares, Pultes directors, executive officers and their
affiliates were entitled to vote approximately 10,988,785 Pulte
common shares, which represented

approximately 26% of the total amount of Pulte common shares
outstanding and entitled to vote on that date. There is no
agreement regarding voting by Pultes executive officers
and directors other than William J. Pulte.

The Del Webb Special Meeting

Time, Place and Purpose of the Meeting.

Arizona 85016. The only business scheduled to come before the
meeting is the proposal to approve and adopt the merger
agreement and the transactions contemplated by the merger
agreement.

Del Webb knows of no other matter to be brought before the Del
Webb special meeting. If any other business should properly come
before the Del Webb special meeting, the persons named in the
proxy card will vote in their discretion on such matter.

Board of Directors Recommendation.  
The board of
directors of Del Webb, with two directors dissenting and one
director absent, has determined that the merger agreement is
fair to and in the best interests of Del Webb and its
stockholders and recommends that Del Webb stockholders vote FOR
approval and adoption of the merger agreement and the
transactions contemplated by the merger agreement.

Record Date.  
The Del Webb board of directors has
fixed the close of business on June 27, 2001, as the record
date for determining the stockholders entitled to vote at the
Del Webb special meeting. Only holders of record of shares of
Del Webb common stock on the record date are entitled to notice
of and to vote at the special meeting. On the record date,
18,924,979 shares of Del Webb common stock were outstanding
and entitled to vote at the Del Webb special meeting.

Quorum.  
The presence, in person or by proxy, of the
holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of Del Webb
common stock entitled to vote is required to constitute a quorum
at the Del Webb special meeting. Abstentions and broker
non-votes will be counted as shares present for purposes of
determining whether a quorum is present, provided, that if a
broker indicates on a proxy that it does not have authority to
vote certain shares, those shares will not be considered as
present. To the extent a proxy does not indicate that a broker
does not have authority to vote the shares to which the proxy
relates, those shares will be considered present even if the
broker states they are not to be voted with regard to the merger.

If a quorum is not present, the stockholders of record, present
in person or by proxy, may adjourn the meeting without notice
other than announcement made at the meeting. Any business may be
transacted at an adjourned meeting which might have been
transacted at the Del Webb special meeting as originally called.
Proxies to be voted against a specific proposal may not be used
to vote for an adjournment of the special meeting for the
purpose of soliciting additional votes in favor of that proposal.

Vote Required at the Del Webb Special Meeting.  
The
affirmative vote, in person or by proxy, of holders of a
majority of the outstanding shares of Del Webb common stock is
required for the approval and adoption of the merger agreement
and the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement.
Although abstentions and broker non-votes will be counted for
purposes of determining the presence of a quorum, abstentions
and broker non-votes will have the same effect as votes against
the proposal to approve and adopt the merger agreement and the
transactions contemplated by the merger agreement.

The holders of Del Webb common stock will be entitled to one
vote for each share of Del Webb common stock they hold.

Stockholdings.  
On the record date, Del Webbs
directors, executive officers and their affiliates beneficially
owned 1,871,339 shares of Del Webb common stock. Of those
shares, Del Webbs directors, executive officers and their
affiliates were entitled to vote 1,002,333 shares of Del
Webb common stock, which represented approximately 5% of the
total amount of shares of Del Webb common stock outstanding and
entitled to vote on that date. There is no agreement or
arrangement regarding voting by Del Webbs executive
officers and directors.

PROXIES

Proxy Cards

The Del Webb and Pulte boards of directors are soliciting
proxies by which holders of Del Webb common stock and Pulte
common shares can vote on the proposals regarding the merger and
the merger agreement. The shares that a properly completed proxy
card represents will be voted in accordance with the
instructions on the proxy card. If a Del Webb or Pulte
shareholder does not return a signed proxy card, that
shareholders shares will not be voted. With respect to Del
Webb, that will have the same effect as a vote against approval
and adoption of the merger agreement and the transactions
contemplated by the merger agreement.

You are urged to mark the box on the proxy card to indicate how
your shares are to be voted. If a Pulte shareholder returns a
signed proxy card, but does not indicate how the shares are to
be voted, the shares represented by the proxy card will be voted
for approval of the issuance of Pulte common shares in
connection with the merger. If a Del Webb stockholder returns a
signed proxy card, but does not indicate how the shares are to
be voted, the shares represented by the proxy card will be voted
for approval and adoption of the merger agreement and the
transactions contemplated by the merger agreement.

The proxy card also authorizes the persons named on the proxy
card to vote in their discretion with regard to any other matter
that is properly presented for action at the applicable special
meeting.

Solicitation of Proxies

Directors, officers and employees of Pulte and Del Webb may
solicit proxies from their respective shareholders personally or
by letter, telephone or facsimile transmission. Each company
will bear the expenses of any solicitation on its behalf.
Directors, officers and other employees of Pulte and Del Webb
will not be specifically compensated for soliciting proxies.
Brokerage houses and other custodians, nominees and fiduciaries
will be requested to forward soliciting materials to the
beneficial owners of Pulte common shares and Del Webb common
stock owned of record by those organizations. Pulte and Del Webb
will pay the reasonable expenses of forwarding such materials.

Pulte has retained Georgeson Shareholder to assist in soliciting
proxies. Pulte will pay Georgeson Shareholder its customary fees
(estimated at $5,500) and will reimburse it for reasonable
expenses it incurs in soliciting proxies.

Del Webb has retained Morrow & Co., Inc., to assist in
soliciting proxies. Del Webb will pay Morrow & Co.,
Inc., its customary fees (estimated at $7,500) and will
reimburse it for reasonable expenses it incurs in soliciting
proxies.

	attending the applicable special meeting and voting in person;

 

	completing, signing and mailing in a new proxy card (in time so
	that the new proxy card is received before the applicable
	special meeting); or

	of Del Webb or Pulte, stating that you are revoking your proxy
	(in time so that the notice is received prior to the applicable
	special meeting).

THE MERGER

Background to the Merger

Del Webbs board of directors and management have from time
to time considered a variety of strategic options as a part of
Del Webbs long-term strategy to maximize stockholder
value. Del Webb engaged Credit Suisse First Boston in the spring
of 2000 as its financial advisor to analyze its business and
strategic alternatives.

As part of its engagement, Credit Suisse First Boston made a
presentation regarding Del Webb, its business, its strategic
alternatives and merger and acquisition activity in the
homebuilding industry to the Del Webb board of directors at the
boards regularly scheduled meeting on July 20, 2000.
This presentation was made following a letter received by Del
Webb in June 2000 from J. F. Shea Co., Inc., a
competitor in the homebuilding business, expressing Sheas
interest in exploring a business combination transaction with
Del Webb.

In August 2000, Pacific Partners LLC announced its
acquisition of 5.32% of the outstanding common stock of Del Webb
and its intention to nominate a slate of candidates for election
to Del Webbs board of directors at the 2000 annual meeting
of stockholders.

During August, September and October 2000, Del Webb and
Credit Suisse First Boston were contacted by a number of other
competitors in the homebuilding industry, including Pulte,
expressing interest in a variety of strategic alliances with Del
Webb, including a possible business combination if Del Webb were
interested in considering such a transaction. On
September 21, 2000, Shea sent a letter to Del Webb setting
forth Sheas indication of interest, subject to specified
conditions, in purchasing all of the outstanding common stock of
Del Webb for $30 in cash per share. On September 24, 2000,
the Del Webb board of directors held a special meeting at which
Del Webb management, as well as Credit Suisse First Boston and
Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom LLP, Del Webbs
special legal counsel, provided an overview of developments in
the proxy contest with Pacific Partners, Sheas indication
of interest and financial information relating to Del Webb. On
October 20, 2000, Pacific Partners began soliciting proxies
to elect its two candidates to the Del Webb board of directors.
On October 23, 2000, Shea announced that it would terminate
its indication of interest in acquiring Del Webb for $30 per
share if Pacific Partners nominees were not elected to the
Del Webb board of directors.

On November 1, 2000, the Del Webb board of directors held a
regular meeting, at which Del Webb management presented its
proposed 2001-2005 strategic plan and discussed various business
opportunities and strategic options. Credit Suisse First Boston
made a presentation regarding the homebuilding industry and
valuation of Del Webb. At the Del Webb annual meeting of
stockholders on November 2, 2000, Del Webb stockholders
reelected the candidates nominated by the board of directors and
did not elect the candidates nominated by Pacific Partners.
Thereafter, Shea withdrew its indication of interest. On
November 2, 2000, following the annual meeting of
stockholders, Del Webbs board of directors reconvened and
authorized Del Webb management to begin implementation of the
2001-2005 strategic plan and to continue to explore alternate
strategies to enhance shareholder value.

In late November 2000, Robert K. Burgess, Pultes
Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, telephoned LeRoy C.
Hanneman, Jr., Del Webbs President and Chief
Executive Officer, and suggested that a meeting be scheduled.
During the call, Mr. Burgess outlined his view of the
potential benefits of a business combination transaction between
Pulte and Del Webb. Mr. Hanneman informed Mr. Burgess
that he was not prepared to recommend consideration of a
business combination transaction to the Del Webb board at that
time in light of the boards recent direction to implement
the strategic plan, but indicated that he might be willing to
entertain additional communications at a later date.

During December 2000, Mr. Burgess telephoned
Mr. Hanneman to reiterate Pultes interest in
discussing a possible business combination transaction between
Pulte and Del Webb and suggested a meeting. Mr. Hanneman
agreed to a meeting in January 2001.

On January 10, 2001, Del Webb and Pulte entered into a
confidentiality and standstill agreement, in which the parties
agreed to keep confidential any information that was exchanged.
On January 11, 2001, Mr. Burgess met with
Mr. Hanneman in Phoenix, Arizona, to discuss a potential
business combination transaction between Pulte and Del Webb.
Later that day, Mr. Burgess, Mark OBrien,
Pultes President and Chief Operating Officer, and Roger
Cregg, Pultes Chief Financial Officer, met with
Mr. Hanneman, John Spencer, Del Webbs Chief Financial
Officer, and Anne L. Mariucci, a Del Webb Executive Vice
President, in Phoenix to discuss generally the businesses and
strategies of Pulte and Del Webb. Messrs. Burgess, Cregg
and OBrien discussed their January 11, 2001 meeting
with Del Webb management at the regularly scheduled meeting of
the Pulte board of directors on January 23, 2001.

On January 26, 2001, Mr. Cregg met with
Mr. Spencer in Phoenix and made available to
Mr. Spencer a copy of Pultes draft pro forma
financial statements reflecting Pulte and Del Webb on a
consolidated basis. On February 8, 2001, at a regular
meeting of Del Webbs board of directors, senior management
advised the board with respect to recent communications between
Del Webb and Pulte. The board authorized management to continue
communications with Pulte. On February 21 and 22, 2001,
Messrs. Hanneman and Spencer, Ms. Mariucci and
Robertson C. Jones, Del Webbs General Counsel, met in
San Diego, California with Messrs. Burgess, OBrien
and Cregg, Michael OBrien, a Pulte Senior Vice President,
and Pultes outside legal counsel to exchange additional
information of a confidential nature regarding the
organizational structure, operations, short-term financial
outlook and strategic direction of the two companies. Additional
telephone calls between Mr. Burgess and Mr. Hanneman
took place during January and February 2001 regarding a
possible business combination transaction, but no specific
proposals were discussed.

At its scheduled dinner meeting on March 7, 2001, the Pulte
board discussed with Pulte management the potential business
combination transaction with Del Webb. At that meeting, the
board authorized Pulte management to continue discussions with
Del Webb. On March 14, 2001, Messrs. Hanneman and
Jones and Ms. Mariucci met with Messrs. Burgess,
OBrien, Cregg and OBrien in Bloomfield Hills,
Michigan, to further discuss a possible business combination
transaction. On March 14, 2001, Messrs. Hanneman and
Spencer and Ms. Mariucci had discussions with Credit Suisse
First Boston regarding a possible business combination
transaction between Del Webb and Pulte. On March 19, 2001,
Mr. Hanneman met with Mr. Burgess in Scottsdale,
Arizona, to discuss further the desirability of a possible
business combination transaction. On March 28, 2001,
Messrs. Burgess and Cregg and Mark OBrien met with
Salomon Smith Barney in New York to discuss the financial
framework of the transaction.

On April 2, 2001, Pulte forwarded materials to Del Webb
indicating a proposed exchange ratio for a possible business
combination transaction, where the consideration would be paid
in Pulte common shares, with the intent that the transaction
would be tax-free for Del Webb stockholders, except to the
extent that cash was received in lieu of any fractional Pulte
common share. Mr. Hanneman telephoned Mr. Burgess to
discuss Pultes basis for such exchange ratio. On the same
day, Del Webb instructed Credit Suisse First Boston to contact
Pultes financial advisor, Salomon Smith Barney, to discuss
the financial terms of a possible business combination
transaction between Del Webb and Pulte.

Between April 2 and April 12, 2001,
Messrs. Burgess and Hanneman, and Pultes and Del
Webbs financial advisors, engaged in various telephone
conversations to discuss the proposed exchange ratio,
termination rights and break-up fees. On April 12, 2001,
Del Webbs board of directors held a regular meeting, at
which Del Webbs management updated the board on the
communications between Del Webb and Pulte regarding the possible
business combination transaction between the two companies. Del
Webbs management, as well as its legal and financial
advisors, analyzed the proposed exchange ratio and the other
potential terms of the proposed business combination. On the
evening of April 12, 2001, Del Webbs board of
directors, at its scheduled dinner meeting, discussed in detail
the proposed business combination transaction with Pulte. The
board authorized Del Webb management to continue discussions
with Pulte within authorized parameters and to provide
appropriate additional confidential information.

On April 13 and 14, 2001, Messrs. Burgess and
Hanneman, and Pultes and Del Webbs financial
advisors, continued their discussions regarding the proposed
exchange ratio, termination rights and break-up fees, and on
April 17, 2001, Del Webb and Pulte reached a preliminary
understanding with respect to a possible exchange ratio, subject
to completion of due diligence and negotiation of all other
terms and conditions of the transaction. The Finance Committee
of the Pulte board of directors met on April 17, 2001, and
discussed the potential combination with Del Webb and scheduled
a meeting of the Pulte board for April 26, 2001. On
April 19, 2001, Honigman Miller Schwartz and Cohn LLP,
counsel to Pulte, delivered to Del Webb and its advisors a draft
merger agreement.

On April 21 and April 22, 2001, each of Pultes
and Del Webbs management, legal counsel, financial
advisors and accountants met at Pultes headquarters to
conduct due diligence and to negotiate the terms of the draft
merger agreement and related documents. At that time, Del Webb
requested that, concurrently with the execution of any merger
agreement, William J. Pulte and affiliated trusts, which
collectively own approximately 26% of the outstanding Pulte
common shares, enter into a voting agreement with Del Webb
pursuant to which Mr. Pulte and the affiliated trusts would
agree to vote in favor of the issuance of Pulte common shares
and related proposals.

On April 23 and 24, 2001, Pultes management met with
Del Webbs management at Del Webbs headquarters to
continue the due diligence process. From April 23 through
April 29, 2001, Pulte and Del Webb and their legal,
financial and accounting advisors continued their due diligence
review and negotiations of the terms of the draft merger
agreement, including the exchange ratio, termination rights and
break-up fees, and related documents.

On April 26, 2001, the Pulte board met to discuss the
proposed transaction. Pultes senior management and
representatives of Honigman Miller and Salomon Smith Barney were
present at the meeting. In preparation for the meeting, the
directors were sent materials regarding Del Webbs
business, operations and financial condition, which had been
prepared by Pultes management, and a draft of the merger
agreement. At the meeting, Pultes senior management
explained the rationale for the transaction. Representatives of
Salomon Smith Barney then reviewed the financial aspects of the
proposed merger with the board. Honigman Miller also discussed
with the board various terms of the merger agreement. The
meeting was adjourned without acting on the transaction, and the
board reconvened on April 30, 2001, to consider the
transaction. At the April 30, 2001, meeting, with all of
the Pulte board as well as Pultes senior management and
representatives of Honigman Miller and Salomon Smith Barney
present, the board received updated presentations from senior
management and Honigman Miller. Salomon Smith Barney reviewed
with the board its financial analysis of the exchange ratio and
rendered to the board an oral opinion, which opinion was
confirmed by delivery of a written opinion dated April 30,
2001, as to the fairness, from a financial point of view, to
Pulte of the exchange ratio. After discussion, the board
approved the merger agreement and the transactions contemplated
by the merger agreement and recommended that Pulte shareholders
vote to approve the proposal for the issuance of Pulte common
shares in connection with the merger.

On April 30, 2001, Del Webbs board of directors held
a special meeting at which management of Del Webb, together with
Del Webbs financial and legal advisors, reviewed the terms
and conditions of the proposed merger. Credit Suisse First
Boston made a detailed financial presentation and rendered its
oral opinion, subsequently confirmed in writing, to the effect
that, as of the date of the opinion and based on and subject to
the matters described in its written opinion, the exchange ratio
was fair to the stockholders of Del Webb from a financial point
of view. Skadden, Arps reviewed with the board the terms and
conditions of the merger agreement and the legal duties and
responsibilities of Del Webbs board of directors in
connection with the merger. The board was also advised of the
interests of certain directors and executive officers in the
transaction that were in addition to the interests of other
stockholders. The board of directors, after extended discussion,
with two directors dissenting and one director absent,
determined that the merger agreement was fair to and in the best
interests of Del Webb and its stockholders and recommended that
the stockholders of Del Webb vote in favor of approval and
adoption of the merger agreement and the transactions
contemplated by the merger agreement.

On April 30, 2001, following the approval of the boards of
directors of Pulte and Del Webb, the parties executed the merger
agreement. The parties issued a joint press release announcing
the execution of the merger agreement prior to the open of
trading on May 1, 2001.

Recommendations of the Pulte Board of Directors;

Pultes Reasons for the Merger

The Pulte board of directors believes the merger of Del Webb and
a wholly owned subsidiary of Pulte on the terms contained in the
merger agreement will be beneficial to Pulte and its
shareholders and that the merger consideration to be paid to
Del Webb stockholders under the merger agreement is fair to
Pulte. Accordingly, at its meeting on April 30, 2001,
Pultes board of directors approved the transaction and
recommended that holders of Pulte common shares vote to approve
the proposal for the issuance of Pulte common shares in
connection with the merger.

The Pulte board believes that the merger will make Pulte a
stronger homebuilding company. In particular, Pulte believes the
merger will:

 

	strengthen our position in the nations fastest growing
	homebuilding markets;

 

	enhance our overall land position;

 

	increase our presence in the retirement/active adult market
	segments of the homebuilding industry;

 

	enable us to capture greater financial services revenues and
	other ancillary revenues;

 

	increase our size in terms of revenue, earnings and EBIT (which
	stands for earnings before interest and taxes) and enhance our
	competitive position and economies of scale;

 

	provide us with operational savings from enhancing purchasing
	leverage; and

 

	help us with homebuilding and mortgage related Internet and
	broadband activities.

Based on a review of public filings made with the Securities and
Exchange Commission, a combined Pulte and Del Webb would have
been the nations largest homebuilder in calendar year 2000
based on homebuilding revenues, domestic homes delivered and
homebuilding EBIT. On a combined pro forma basis, Pulte and Del
Webb would have reported revenues of $6.055 billion and
EBIT of $578 million in calendar year 2000.

In deciding to approve the acquisition of Del Webb, the Pulte
directors considered the items described in the preceding
paragraph and a number of other factors, including:

 

	the current and historical market price of Pulte common shares;

 

	the continued expansion of Pultes homebuilding business in
	high growth markets and its expansion into new geographic
	markets;

 

	the strong financial condition of the combined company;

 

	the expected accounting treatment of the merger;

 

	the terms and conditions of the merger agreement; and

 

	the presentations and advice of its senior management, financial
	advisor and legal counsel, as discussed above.

The Pulte board also considered potentially negative factors
relating to the merger, including:

 

	the increased financial leverage of the combined company;

 

	the challenges of integrating the management, operations and
	cultures of the companies; and

 

	the risk that operational savings from synergies may not be
	achieved.

The above discussion is not intended to be exhaustive of the
factors considered by the Pulte board but includes all material
factors considered. Each member of the Pulte board of directors
may have considered different factors, and the Pulte board of
directors evaluated these factors and did not quantify or
otherwise assign relative weights to factors considered. In
addition, the Pulte board of directors did not reach any
specific conclusion with respect to each of the factors
considered or any aspect of any particular factor. Instead, the
Pulte board of directors conducted an overall analysis of the
factors described above.

Based on the considerations described above, the Pulte board
of directors has approved the merger and the issuance of Pulte
common shares in connection with the merger and recommends that
Pultes shareholders vote FOR the share issuance.

Recommendation of the Del Webb Board of Directors;

Del Webbs Reasons for the Merger

At its meeting on April 30, 2001, the Del Webb board of
directors, by a vote of eight to two, with one director absent,
determined that the terms of the merger agreement are fair to
and in the best interests of Del Webb and its stockholders and
recommended that the stockholders of Del Webb vote for approval
and adoption of the merger agreement. During the course of its
deliberations, the Del Webb board of directors considered, with
the assistance of management and its financial and legal
advisors, a number of factors. The following discussion of the
factors considered by the Del Webb board of directors in making
its decision includes all material factors considered by the Del
Webb board of directors.

Among the factors the Del Webb board of directors considered in
deciding to approve the merger are the following:

 

	historical information regarding the respective businesses,
	prospects, financial performances and conditions, operations,
	management and competitive positions of Pulte and Del Webb;

 

	current financial market conditions and historical market
	prices, volatility and trading information with respect to Del
	Webb common stock and Pulte common shares;

 

	the directors knowledge and analysis of the current
	homebuilding industry environment, characterized by evolving
	trends toward consolidation and increasing competition;

 

	the fact that some other homebuilders with whom Del Webb is
	compared by analysts have stock prices with generally greater
	earnings per share multiples based on market capitalization and
	trading volume;

 

	the terms and conditions of the merger agreement, including the
	parties representations, warranties and covenants, and the
	conditions to their respective obligations;

 

	the consideration to be received by Del Webb stockholders in the
	merger and the fact that the exchange ratio in the merger
	represents a significant premium over relative trading prices of
	the two securities for the preceding 12 months;

 

	the fact that Del Webb can terminate the merger agreement
	without penalty if the average last sale price of Pulte common
	shares for the 15 trading days ending on, and including, the
	third trading day prior to the Del Webb special meeting is less
	than $27.00;

 

	the terms of the merger agreement regarding the right of Del
	Webb to consider and negotiate an alternative transaction, as
	well as the possible effects of the provisions regarding
	termination fees;

 

	the structure of the merger, which would permit the holders of
	Del Webb common stock to exchange their shares for Pulte common
	shares in a transaction that is intended to be tax-free for
	United States federal income tax purposes, except to the extent
	of any cash received in lieu of any fractional Pulte common
	share;

 

	the fact that Del Webb stockholders will be able to participate
	in any future growth of Del Webb through their ownership of
	Pulte common shares, while those Del Webb stockholders who do not

	wish to own Pulte common shares will have the opportunity to
	sell Pulte common shares received in the merger in the ensuing
	months;

 

	the presentation and oral opinion of Credit Suisse First Boston,
	which was later confirmed in writing, to the effect that, as of
	the date of such opinion, and based on and subject to the
	matters described in its written opinion, the exchange ratio was
	fair to the stockholders of Del Webb from a financial point of
	view;

 

	the fact that three directors of Del Webb will be appointed to
	the Pulte board of directors, and the terms of office of such
	directors;

 

	the percentage of the total outstanding Pulte common shares that
	former Del Webb stockholders will own following the merger based
	on the exchange ratio;

 

	the fact that, under Delaware law, the directors fiduciary
	duties in evaluating the merger are owed to Del Webbs
	stockholders and not to other constituencies of the company,
	such as customers, suppliers and employees;

 

	the directors knowledge of Del Webbs business,
	operations, financial condition and prospects if it were to
	remain independent, including the desirability of having
	additional flexibility to obtain capital to facilitate the
	growth of its business;

 

	the fact that Pulte may provide greater levels of capital and
	resources to Del Webb than Del Webb could achieve independently;

 

	the directors assessment of Del Webbs other
	strategic alternatives to enhance stockholder value and whether
	the merger was more attractive than such alternatives;

 

	whether the combination with Pulte presents opportunities to
	create greater economies of scale, by combining human resources,
	technology and land resources; and

 

	the significant product and geographic diversification of the
	combined companies.

The Del Webb board of directors also considered a number of
potentially negative factors relating to the merger, including:

 

	the risk that the potential benefits sought in the merger might
	not be fully realized;

 

	the fact that Del Webb will no longer be an independent company
	and the risk that Pulte may not take full advantage of the value
	in the brandnames Del Webb, Sun
	City, and Anthem, although the Del
	Webb corporate name will be maintained after the closing of the
	merger;

 

	the risk that Pulte may not take full advantage of the unique
	position of Del Webb with respect to demographic trends and the
	retirement community business;

 

	the challenges of integrating the management teams, strategies,
	cultures and organizations of the two companies;

 

	the fact that LeRoy Hanneman and certain other members of senior
	management would not continue with Del Webb after consummation
	of the merger;

 

	the risks associated with the fluctuations in the price of Del
	Webb common stock and Pulte common shares prior to the closing
	of the merger and the effect that such fluctuations might have
	on the number of Pulte common shares that Del Webb stockholders
	will receive in the merger;

 

	the fact that certain members of Del Webbs management and
	board of directors may have interests in the merger in addition
	to the interests of other Del Webb stockholders;

 

	the impact of the merger on Del Webbs employees,
	customers, communities and suppliers and how such impact might
	affect shareholder value of the combined company;

 

	the possible distraction of management from day-to-day
	operations; and

 

	other applicable risks described in the section captioned
	Risk Factors.

The Del Webb board of directors who voted in favor of the merger
agreement believed that these risks were outweighed by the
potential benefits of the merger. The two directors who voted
against the merger questioned whether the potential benefits of
the merger would be realized or would be outweighed by the
potential negative factors.

The above discussion is not exhaustive of all factors considered
by the Del Webb board of directors. Each member of the Del Webb
board of directors may have considered different factors and may
have assigned different relative weights to the factors
considered. In addition, the Del Webb board of directors did not
quantify or reach any specific conclusion with respect to each
of the factors considered, or any aspect of any particular
factor. Instead, the Del Webb board of directors conducted an
overall analysis of the factors described above.

Based on the considerations described above, the
Del Webb board of directors, with two directors dissenting
and one director absent, has determined that the merger
agreement is fair to and in the best interests of Del Webb
and its stockholders and recommends that Del Webb
stockholders vote FOR approval and adoption of the merger
agreement and the transactions contemplated by the merger
agreement.

Opinion of Pultes Financial Advisor

Pulte retained Salomon Smith Barney to act as its exclusive
financial advisor in connection with the proposed merger. In
connection with its engagement, Pulte requested that Salomon
Smith Barney evaluate the fairness, from a financial point of
view, to Pulte of the exchange ratio provided for in the merger.
On April 30, 2001, at a meeting of the Pulte board of
directors held to evaluate the proposed merger, Salomon Smith
Barney rendered to the Pulte board an oral opinion, which
opinion was confirmed by delivery of a written opinion dated
April 30, 2001, to the effect that, as of that date and
based on and subject to the matters described in the opinion,
the exchange ratio was fair, from a financial point of view, to
Pulte.

In arriving at its opinion, Salomon Smith Barney:

 

	reviewed the merger agreement;

 

	held discussions with senior officers, directors and other
	representatives and advisors of Pulte and senior officers and
	other representatives and advisors of Del Webb concerning the
	businesses, operations and prospects of Pulte and Del Webb;

 

	examined publicly available business and financial information
	relating to Pulte and Del Webb;

 

	examined financial forecasts and other information and data
	relating to Pulte and Del Webb which were provided to or
	otherwise discussed with Salomon Smith Barney by the managements
	of Pulte and Del Webb, including information relating to the
	potential strategic implications and operational benefits
	anticipated by the managements of Pulte and Del Webb to result
	from the merger;

 

	reviewed the financial terms of the merger as set forth in the
	merger agreement in relation to, among other things, current and
	historical market prices and trading volumes of Pulte common
	shares and Del Webb common stock, the historical and projected
	earnings and other operating data of Pulte and Del Webb, and the
	capitalization and financial condition of Pulte and Del Webb;

 

	considered, to the extent publicly available, the financial
	terms of other transactions effected which Salomon Smith Barney
	considered relevant in evaluating the merger;

 

	analyzed financial, stock market and other publicly available
	information relating to the businesses of other companies whose
	operations Salomon Smith Barney considered relevant in
	evaluating those of Pulte and Del Webb;

 

	evaluated the potential pro forma financial impact of the merger
	on Pulte; and

 

	conducted other analyses and examinations and considered other
	financial, economic and market criteria as Salomon Smith Barney
	deemed appropriate in arriving at its opinion.

In rendering its opinion, Salomon Smith Barney assumed and
relied, without independent verification, on the accuracy and
completeness of all financial and other information and data
publicly available or furnished to or otherwise reviewed by or
discussed with Salomon Smith Barney. With respect to financial
forecasts and other information and data relating to Pulte and
Del Webb provided to or otherwise discussed with Salomon Smith
Barney, the managements of Pulte and Del Webb advised Salomon
Smith Barney that the forecasts and other information and data
were reasonably prepared on bases reflecting the best currently
available estimates and judgments of the managements of Pulte
and Del Webb as to the future financial performance of Pulte and
Del Webb and the potential strategic implications and
operational benefits anticipated to result from the merger,
including the amount, timing and achievability of those
strategic implications and operational benefits. Salomon Smith
Barney assumed, with Pultes consent, that the merger will
be treated as a tax-free reorganization for federal income tax
purposes.

Salomon Smith Barneys opinion relates to the relative
values of Pulte and Del Webb. Salomon Smith Barney did not
express any opinion as to what the value of the Pulte common
shares actually will be when issued in the merger or the prices
at which the Pulte common shares will trade or otherwise be
transferable after the merger. Salomon Smith Barney did not make
and was not provided with an independent evaluation or appraisal
of the assets or liabilities, contingent or otherwise, of Pulte
or Del Webb and did not make any physical inspection of the
properties or assets of Pulte or Del Webb.

Salomon Smith Barney expressed no view as to, and its opinion
does not address, the relative merits of the merger as compared
to any alternative business strategies that might exist for
Pulte or the effect of any other transaction in which Pulte
might engage. Salomon Smith Barneys opinion was
necessarily based on information available, and financial, stock
market and other conditions and circumstances existing and
disclosed, to Salomon Smith Barney as of the date of its
opinion. Although Salomon Smith Barney evaluated the exchange
ratio from a financial point of view, Salomon Smith Barney was
not asked to and did not recommend the specific consideration
payable in the merger, which was determined through negotiation
between Pulte and Del Webb. Pulte imposed no other instructions
or limitations on Salomon Smith Barney with respect to the
investigations made or procedures followed by Salomon Smith
Barney in rendering its opinion.

The full text of Salomon Smith Barneys written opinion
dated April 30, 2001, which describes the assumptions made,
matters considered and limitations on the review undertaken, is
attached to this document as Annex II and is incorporated into
this Joint Proxy Statement/ Prospectus by reference. Salomon
Smith Barneys opinion is addressed to the Pulte board of
directors and relates only to the fairness, from a financial
point of view, to Pulte of the exchange ratio, does not address
any other aspect of the merger and does not constitute a
recommendation to any shareholder with respect to any matter
relating to the proposed merger.

In preparing its opinion, Salomon Smith Barney performed a
variety of financial and comparative analyses, including those
described below. The summary of these analyses is not a complete
description of the analyses underlying Salomon Smith
Barneys opinion. The preparation of a fairness opinion is
a complex analytical process involving various determinations as
to the most appropriate and relevant methods of financial
analysis and the application of those methods to the particular
circumstances and, therefore, a fairness opinion is not readily
susceptible to summary description. Accordingly, Salomon Smith
Barney believes that its analyses must be considered as a whole
and that selecting portions of its analyses and factors or
focusing on information presented in tabular format, without
considering all analyses and factors, could create a misleading
or incomplete view of the processes underlying its analyses and
opinion.

In its analyses, Salomon Smith Barney considered industry
performance, general business, economic, market and financial
conditions and other matters existing as of the date of its
opinion, many of which are beyond the control of Pulte and Del
Webb. No company, transaction or business used in those analyses
as a comparison is identical to Pulte, Del Webb or the proposed
merger, and an evaluation of those analyses

is not entirely mathematical. Rather, the analyses involve
complex considerations and judgments concerning financial and
operating characteristics and other factors that could affect
the acquisition, public trading or other values of the
companies, business segments or transactions analyzed.

The estimates contained in Salomon Smith Barneys analyses
and the valuation ranges resulting from any particular analysis
are not necessarily indicative of actual values or predictive of
future results or values, which may be significantly more or
less favorable than those suggested by its analyses. In
addition, analyses relating to the value of businesses or
securities do not necessarily purport to be appraisals or to
reflect the prices at which businesses or securities actually
may be sold. Accordingly, Salomon Smith Barneys analyses
and estimates are inherently subject to substantial uncertainty.

Salomon Smith Barneys opinion and analyses were only one
of many factors considered by the Pulte board of directors in
its evaluation of the merger and should not be viewed as
determinative of the views of the Pulte board of directors or
management with respect to the exchange ratio or the proposed
merger.

The following is a summary of the material financial analyses
performed by Salomon Smith Barney in connection with the
rendering of its opinion dated April 30, 2001. 
The
financial analyses summarized below include information
presented in tabular format. In order to fully understand
Salomon Smith Barneys financial analyses, the tables must
be read together with the text of each summary. The tables alone
do not constitute a complete description of the financial
analyses. Considering the data below without considering the
full narrative description of the financial analyses, including
the methodologies and assumptions underlying the analyses, could
create a misleading or incomplete view of Salomon Smith
Barneys financial analyses.

Public Market Analysis.  
Using publicly available
information, Salomon Smith Barney reviewed the market values and
trading multiples of Pulte, Del Webb and the following 13
selected publicly held companies in the homebuilding industry.
Companies within this industry with a firm value of
$1.0 billion or less are referred to below as small cap
companies, companies with a firm value of greater than
$1.0 billion but less than $2.0 billion are referred
to below as mid cap companies, and companies with a firm value
of greater than $2.0 billion are referred to below as large cap
companies:

All multiples were based on closing stock prices on
April 27, 2001. Estimated financial data for the selected
companies were based on public filings and publicly available
research analysts estimates. Estimated financial data for
Pulte and Del Webb were based on public filings and internal
estimates of the managements of Pulte and Del Webb. Salomon
Smith Barney compared equity market values as multiples of
latest 12 months and estimated calendar years 2001 and 2002
net income and latest available book value. Salomon Smith Barney
then applied a range of selected multiples derived from the
selected companies to corresponding financial data of Pulte and
Del Webb in order to derive implied equity reference ranges for
Pulte and Del Webb, which were used to calculate an implied
exchange ratio range. Salomon Smith Barney also performed this
analysis by applying a 35% change of control premium to the
implied equity reference range derived from this analysis for
Del Webb. This analysis indicated the following implied exchange
ratio ranges, as compared to the exchange ratio range in the
merger:

All multiples were based on publicly available information for
the relevant transaction. Salomon Smith Barney compared purchase
prices in the selected transactions as multiples of latest
12 months net income and latest available book value.
Salomon Smith Barney then applied a range of selected multiples
derived from the selected transactions to corresponding
financial data of Del Webb in order to derive an implied equity
reference range for Del Webb, which was used, together with the
implied equity reference range for Pulte derived from the public
market analysis described above, to calculate an implied
exchange ratio range. This analysis indicated the following
implied exchange ratio range, as compared to the exchange ratio
range in the merger:

Contribution Analysis.
  Salomon Smith Barney
compared the relative contributions of Pulte and Del Webb to the
combined companys income statement and operational data
for the latest 12 months, income statement data for
calendar year 2000 and estimated calendar years 2001 and 2002
and balance sheet data as of March 31, 2001, and estimated
as of September 30, 2001. Financial and operational data
used in this analysis were based both on public filings and
internal estimates of the managements of Pulte and Del Webb.
This analysis indicated that Del Webb would contribute to the
combined company approximately 12.8% to 47.3% of the financial
and operational data reviewed, as compared to the implied pro
forma equity ownership of Del Webbs stockholders in the
combined company based on the low and high end of the exchange
ratio range of approximately 27.2% to 32.5%.

Salomon Smith Barney also calculated an implied exchange ratio
range based on the percentage contributions of Pulte and Del
Webb to the combined companys financial and operational
data as described above. This analysis resulted in an implied
exchange ratio range of 0.32x to 1.98x, as compared to the
exchange ratio range in the merger of 0.866x to 1.100x.

Pro Forma Merger Analysis.  
Salomon Smith Barney
analyzed the potential pro forma financial effect of the merger
on Pultes estimated earnings per share for calendar years
2001 and 2002 based on internal estimates of the managements of
Pulte and Del Webb, both before and after giving effect to
potential cost savings and other synergies anticipated by the
managements of Pulte and Del Webb to result from the merger.
Based on the exchange ratio range provided for in the merger,
this analysis indicated that the proposed merger could be
accretive to Pultes earnings per share except at the high
end of the exchange ratio range after giving full effect to
potential cost savings and other synergies anticipated by the

managements of Pulte and Del Webb to result from the merger and
could be dilutive to Pultes earnings per share before
giving effect to potential cost savings and other synergies. The
actual results achieved by Pulte may vary from projected results
and the variations may be material.

Other Factors.
  In rendering its opinion, Salomon
Smith Barney also reviewed and considered other factors,
including:

 

	historical market prices and trading volumes of Pulte common
	shares and Del Webb common stock;

 

	the relationship between movements in Pulte common shares and
	Del Webb common stock and movements in the common stock of
	selected large cap companies in the homebuilding industry;

 

	the combined companys capital structure;

 

	a comparison of Pultes and Del Webbs book value and
	market value;

 

	the premiums paid in selected transactions; and

 

	selected research analysts reports on Pulte and Del Webb.

Miscellaneous.  
Under the terms of its engagement,
Pulte has agreed to pay Salomon Smith Barney for its financial
advisory services upon completion of the merger an aggregate fee
of $7.5 million. Pulte also has agreed to reimburse Salomon
Smith Barney for reasonable travel and other expenses incurred
by Salomon Smith Barney in performing its services, including
reasonable fees and expenses of its legal counsel, and to
indemnify Salomon Smith Barney and related persons against
liabilities, including liabilities under the federal securities
laws, arising out of its engagement.

In the ordinary course of business, Salomon Smith Barney and its
affiliates may actively trade or hold the securities of Pulte
and Del Webb for their own account or for the account of
customers and, accordingly, may at any time hold a long or short
position in those securities. Salomon Smith Barney and its
affiliates in the past have provided services to Del Webb
unrelated to the proposed merger, for which services Salomon
Smith Barney and its affiliates have received compensation. In
addition, Salomon Smith Barney and its affiliates, including
Citigroup Inc. and its affiliates, may maintain relationships
with Pulte, Del Webb and their respective affiliates.

Pulte selected Salomon Smith Barney as its exclusive financial
advisor based on Salomon Smith Barneys experience and
expertise. Salomon Smith Barney is an internationally recognized
investment banking firm which regularly engages in the valuation
of businesses and their securities in connection with mergers
and acquisitions, negotiated underwritings, competitive bids,
secondary distributions of listed and unlisted securities,
private placements and valuations for estate, corporate and
other purposes.

Opinion of Del Webbs Financial Advisor

Credit Suisse First Boston has acted as Del Webbs
exclusive financial advisor in connection with the merger. Del
Webb selected Credit Suisse First Boston based on Credit Suisse
First Bostons experience, expertise and reputation, and
its familiarity with Del Webbs business. Credit Suisse
First Boston is an internationally recognized investment banking
firm and is regularly engaged in the valuation of businesses and
securities in connection with mergers and acquisitions,
leveraged buyouts, negotiated underwritings, competitive
biddings, secondary distributions of listed and unlisted
securities, private placements and valuations for corporate and
other purposes.

In connection with Credit Suisse First Bostons engagement,
Del Webb requested that Credit Suisse First Boston evaluate the
fairness to the stockholders of Del Webb of the exchange ratio
pursuant to the merger agreement from a financial point of view.
On April 30, 2001, at a meeting of the Del Webb board held
to consider the merger, Credit Suisse First Boston rendered to
the Del Webb board an oral opinion, which opinion was confirmed
by delivery of a written opinion dated April 30, 2001, to
the effect that, as of that date and based on and subject to the
matters described in its opinion, the exchange ratio pursuant to
the merger agreement was fair to the stockholders of Del Webb
from a financial point of view.

The full text of Credit Suisse First Bostons written
opinion dated April 30, 2001, to the Del Webb board, which
sets forth the procedures followed, assumptions made, matters
considered and limitations on the review undertaken, is attached
as Annex III and is incorporated into this document by
reference. Holders of Del Webb common stock are urged to read
this opinion carefully in its entirety. Credit Suisse First
Bostons opinion is addressed to the Del Webb board and
relates only to the fairness of the exchange ratio pursuant to
the merger agreement to the stockholders of Del Webb from a
financial point of view, does not address any other aspect of
the proposed merger or any related transaction and does not
constitute a recommendation to any stockholder as to how such
stockholder should vote with respect to any matter relating to
the merger. The summary of Credit Suisse First Bostons
opinion in this document is qualified in its entirety by
reference to the full text of the opinion.

In arriving at its opinion, Credit Suisse First Boston reviewed
publicly available business and financial information relating
to Del Webb and Pulte, as well as the merger agreement. Credit
Suisse First Boston also reviewed other information, including
financial forecasts, provided by Del Webb and Pulte, and met
with the managements of Del Webb and Pulte to discuss the
businesses and prospects of Del Webb and Pulte.

Credit Suisse First Boston also considered financial and stock
market data of Del Webb and Pulte, and compared those data with
similar data for other publicly held companies in businesses
similar to Del Webb and Pulte and considered the financial terms
of certain other business combinations and transactions which
have recently been effected. Credit Suisse First Boston also
considered such other information, financial studies, analyses
and investigations and financial, economic and market criteria
that it deemed relevant.

In connection with its review, Credit Suisse First Boston did
not assume any responsibility for independent verification of
any of the foregoing information and relied on it being complete
and accurate in all material respects. With respect to the
financial forecasts, with the consent of Del Webbs board,
Credit Suisse First Boston assumed that the forecasts were
reasonably prepared on bases reflecting the best currently
available estimates and judgments of the managements of Del Webb
and Pulte as to the future financial performance of Del Webb and
Pulte and as to the cost savings and other potential synergies,
including the amount, timing and achievability of those,
anticipated to result from the merger. Del Webb also informed
Credit Suisse First Boston, and Credit Suisse First Boston
assumed, that the merger will be treated as a tax-free
reorganization for federal income tax purposes. In addition,
Credit Suisse First Boston was not requested to make, and did
not make, an independent evaluation or appraisal of the assets
or liabilities, contingent or otherwise, of Del Webb or Pulte,
nor was Credit Suisse First Boston furnished with any
evaluations or appraisals. Credit Suisse First Bostons
opinion was necessarily based on information available to it and
financial, economic, market and other conditions as they existed
and could be evaluated on the date of its opinion. Credit Suisse
First Boston did not express any opinion as to the actual value
of Pulte common shares when issued to Del Webbs
stockholders pursuant to the merger or the prices at which Pulte
common shares would trade at any time. Credit Suisse First
Boston was not requested to, and did not, solicit third party
indications of interest in acquiring all or any part of Del Webb.

In preparing its opinion to the Del Webb board, Credit Suisse
First Boston performed a variety of financial and comparative
analyses, including those described below. The summary of Credit
Suisse First Bostons analyses described below is not a
complete description of the analyses underlying Credit Suisse
First Bostons opinion. The preparation of a fairness
opinion is a complex analytical process involving various
determinations as to the most appropriate and relevant methods
of financial analysis and the application of those methods to
the particular circumstances and, therefore, a fairness opinion
is not readily susceptible to summary description. In arriving
at its opinion, Credit Suisse First Boston made qualitative
judgments as to the significance and relevance of each analysis
and factor that it considered. Accordingly, Credit Suisse First
Boston believes that its analyses must be considered as a whole
and that selecting portions of its analyses and factors, without
considering all analyses and factors, could create a misleading
or incomplete view of the processes underlying its analyses and
opinion.

In its analyses, Credit Suisse First Boston considered industry
performance, regulatory, general business, economic, market and
financial conditions and other matters, many of which are beyond
the control of Del Webb and Pulte. No company, transaction or
business used in Credit Suisse First Bostons analyses as a
comparison is identical to Del Webb or Pulte or the proposed
merger, and an evaluation of the results of those analyses is
not entirely mathematical. Rather, the analyses involve complex
considerations and judgments concerning financial and operating
characteristics and other factors that could affect the
acquisition, public trading or other values of the companies,
business segments or transactions analyzed.

The estimates contained in Credit Suisse First Bostons
analyses and the ranges of valuations resulting from any
particular analysis are not necessarily indicative of actual
values or predictive of future results or values, which may be
significantly more or less favorable than those suggested by the
analyses. In addition, analyses relating to the value of
businesses or securities do not necessarily purport to be
appraisals or to reflect the prices at which businesses or
securities actually may be sold. Accordingly, Credit Suisse
First Bostons analyses and estimates are inherently
subject to substantial uncertainty.

As described in the section captioned The
Merger  Recommendation of the Del Webb Board of
Directors; Del Webbs Reasons for the Merger, Credit
Suisse First Bostons opinion and financial analyses were
only one of many factors considered by the Del Webb board in its
evaluation of the proposed merger and should not be viewed as
determinative of the views of the Del Webb board or management
with respect to the merger or the exchange ratio.

The following is a summary of the material financial analyses
underlying Credit Suisse First Bostons opinion dated
April 30, 2001, delivered to the Del Webb board in
connection with the merger. 
The financial analyses summarized
below include information presented in tabular format. In order
to fully understand Credit Suisse First Bostons financial
analyses, the tables must be read together with the text of each
summary. The tables alone do not constitute a complete
description of the financial analyses. Considering the data in
the tables below without considering the full narrative
description of the financial analyses, including the
methodologies and assumptions underlying the analyses, could
create a misleading or incomplete view of Credit Suisse First
Bostons financial analyses.

Contribution Analysis.  
Credit Suisse First Boston
performed a contribution analysis, comparing the relative
contributions of Del Webb and Pulte to the actual calendar year
2000 and estimated calendar years 2001 and 2002 EBITDA and net
income of the combined company and to the book value of the
combined companys equity value based on each
companys book value as of March 31, 2001. For purposes of
this analysis, estimated EBITDA and net income were from Del
Webb and Pulte management projections. In addition, equity value
is defined as each companys stock price as of
April 27, 2001, multiplied by that companys number of
shares outstanding on a fully diluted basis using the treasury
stock method. This analysis did not take into account any
expected synergies from the proposed merger. EBITDA
refers to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and
amortization. For purposes of the percentage contributions based
on EBITDA, the percentages for each company were adjusted to
reflect that companys leverage. The following table
presents the results of this analysis:

Credit Suisse First Boston noted that, based on an assumed
exchange ratio of 0.866 and assuming all Del Webb options were
converted into Pulte options in the merger, Del Webb
stockholders would own approximately 28.4% of the common stock
of the combined company on a fully diluted basis using the
treasury stock method and Pulte stockholders would own
approximately 71.6% of the common stock of the combined company
on a fully diluted basis using the treasury stock method. This
analysis yielded an implied exchange ratio reference range of
0.77 to 0.92.

Exchange Ratio Analysis.  
Credit Suisse First Boston
performed an exchange ratio analysis comparing the average daily
closing stock prices for Del Webb and Pulte on April 27,
2001, and for the one-month, three-month, six-month, one-year
and two-year periods ending April 27, 2001. This comparison
yielded an implied exchange ratio reference range of 0.68 to
0.87, as indicated in the following table:

Comparable Publicly Traded Companies Analysis. 

Credit Suisse First Boston reviewed and compared financial,
operating and stock market data of Del Webb and Pulte to
corresponding data of the following publicly traded
large-capitalization companies in the homebuilding industry,
referred to in this description as the Large-Cap Companies:

 

	Centex Corporation

 

	D.R. Horton Inc.

 

	KB Home

 

	Lennar Corporation

 

	Pulte

In addition, Credit Suisse First Boston compared financial,
operating and stock market data of Del Webb and Pulte to
corresponding data of the following publicly traded
mid-capitalization companies in the homebuilding business,
referred to in this description as the Mid-Cap Companies:

 

	Beazer Homes USA, Inc.

 

	Del Webb

 

	Hovnanian Enterprises

 

	M.D.C. Holdings, Inc.

 

	M/ I Schottenstein Homes

 

	NVR, Inc.

 

	Standard Pacific Corp.

 

	The Ryland Group, Inc.

 

	Toll Brothers, Inc.

In this analysis, Credit Suisse First Boston reviewed for Del
Webb, Pulte and the selected companies, among other things,
(1) enterprise values as multiples of revenues, EBITDA and
EBIT for the last twelve months, or LTM, as of each
companys most recent filing with the Securities and
Exchange Commission, (2) stock price to earnings per share
ratios for the LTM period, and as estimated for calendar year
2001, (3) price as a multiple of tangible book values per
share and (4) net debt as a percentage of book

capitalization. Estimated financial data for the selected
companies were based on publicly available research
analysts estimates. For purposes of this analysis,
enterprise value was calculated for each company by multiplying
share prices by total shares outstanding on a fully diluted
basis using the treasury stock method and then adding to that
product homebuilding and corporate debt and the market value of
preferred stock and subtracting homebuilding and corporate cash.
EBIT refers to earnings before interest and taxes.

This analysis yielded an implied exchange ratio reference range
of 0.60 to 0.88. The following table presents the results of
that analysis:

Selected M&A Transactions Analysis.  
Credit
Suisse First Boston analyzed the implied transaction multiples
paid or proposed to be paid in 33 selected merger and
acquisition transactions in the homebuilding industry. With
respect to these transactions, Credit Suisse First Boston
reviewed (1) equity value of the target company implied by
the merger consideration paid in the relevant transaction as a
multiple of LTM net income and tangible book value and
(2) enterprise value of the target company implied by the
merger consideration paid in the relevant transaction to LTM net
sales, and EBITDA and as a multiple of total assets. For
purposes of this analysis, enterprise value was defined as a
companys equity value plus its total debt and minus its
total cash. Based on a review of the foregoing multiples, and
taking into account trading multiples of the selected comparable
publicly traded companies referenced above, this analysis
yielded an implied exchange ratio reference range of 0.62 to
0.92.

Premiums Paid Analysis.  
Credit Suisse First Boston
reviewed the premiums paid in five merger and acquisition
transactions in the homebuilding industry where the
consideration paid was in stock of the acquiring company based
on the closing stock prices of the target company one day, one
week and one month prior to public announcement of the relevant
transaction, as set forth in the following table:

Miscellaneous.  
Pursuant to the terms of an
engagement letter dated May 17, 2000, as supplemented
December 18, 2000 and April 23, 2001, Del Webb has
paid to Credit Suisse First Boston $1 million for the
fairness opinion described above. In addition, Del Webb has
agreed to pay Credit Suisse First Boston a fee that is customary
in transactions of this nature, a substantial portion of which
is contingent upon the consummation of the merger, against which
will be credited the $1 million fairness fee already
described. In addition, Del Webb has agreed to reimburse Credit
Suisse First Boston for its reasonable out-of-pocket expenses,
including fees and expenses of its legal counsel and any other
advisor retained by Credit Suisse First Boston, and to indemnify
Credit Suisse First Boston and certain related parties against
liabilities, including liabilities under the federal securities
laws, arising out of its engagement.

Credit Suisse First Boston has, in the past, provided investment
banking services to Del Webb unrelated to the merger, for which
services Credit Suisse First Boston has received compensation.
In the ordinary course of its business, Credit Suisse First
Boston and its affiliates may actively trade the debt and

equity securities of both Del Webb and Pulte for their own
accounts and for the accounts of those customers and,
accordingly, may at any time hold long or short positions in
those securities.

Accounting Treatment

The merger will be treated as a purchase for financial
accounting purposes.

Interests of Certain Persons in the Merger

In considering the recommendation of the Del Webb board of
directors that Del Webb stockholders vote in favor of the merger
agreement and the transactions contemplated by the merger
agreement, Del Webb stockholders should be aware that some Del
Webb directors and executive officers may have interests in the
merger that are in addition to the interests of Del Webb
stockholders generally. The Del Webb board of directors was
aware of, and considered, these interests in approving the
merger agreement and the transactions contemplated by the merger
agreement.

Indemnification of Officers and Directors.  
The
merger agreement provides that all rights of indemnification for
acts and omissions occurring before the closing of the merger
and existing in favor of the directors, officers and employees
of Del Webb as provided in the Del Webb Certificate of
Incorporation and By-Laws or any indemnification agreements will
survive the closing of the merger.

Directors and Officers Insurance.  
The
merger agreement requires Pulte to cause Del Webb to keep in
effect, for at least six years, directors and
officers liability insurance policies maintained by Del
Webb or substitute policies having the same coverage and
containing terms and conditions no less advantageous to the
persons covered by the policies currently in effect. Neither
Pulte nor Del Webb will be required to pay more than three times
the annual premium paid relating to the year in which the merger
agreement was executed. If they are not able to maintain the
required insurance for that amount, they are required to
purchase as much coverage as they can obtain for that amount.

The Pulte Board of Directors.  
The board of
directors of Pulte has agreed, effective as of the closing of
the merger, to appoint to the Pulte board to serve until the
next annual meeting of Pulte shareholders three persons
designated by Del Webb who are reasonably acceptable to Pulte.
Del Webb has designated three members of its board of directors,
D. Kent Anderson, Michael E. Rossi and Glenn W.
Schaeffer, who have been accepted by Pulte. Pursuant to
Pultes Articles of Incorporation, Pulte directors serve in
classes for staggered, three-year terms, and directors who are
appointed by the board must be elected to a class at the next
annual meeting of Pulte shareholders for the election of
directors.

Stock Options and Shares of Restricted Stock. 

Pursuant to Del Webbs equity-based compensation plans,
all of Del Webbs outstanding unvested stock options will
accelerate and vest upon approval of the merger by Del Webb
stockholders. Pursuant to the merger agreement, Del Webb stock
options, at the election of the holder, will either
(1) become a right to receive a cash payment equal to the
difference between the calculated value of the Pulte Common
Shares (based on the average last sale price as described in the
section captioned The Merger Agreement 
Exchange of Shares) which would be issued in the merger
for each share of Del Webb common stock underlying the option
and the applicable option exercise price, multiplied by the
number of shares of Del Webb Common Stock issuable upon exercise
of the option or (2) convert into an option to acquire
Pulte common shares, as adjusted for the exchange ratio. In
addition, restrictions will lapse on all shares of restricted
stock held by Del Webb employees and such restricted shares will
convert to fully vested shares and no longer be subject to
forfeiture.

Employment Agreements.  
Del Webb has employment
agreements with the following executive officers: LeRoy C.
Hanneman, Jr., John H. Gleason, Anne L. Mariucci,
John A. Spencer, Frank D. Pankratz and David G.
Schreiner. Pursuant to each employment agreement, the employee
is entitled to receive severance benefits if, within
24 months following a change in control of Del Webb, the
employee is terminated (1) by Del Webb without cause,
(2) under specified circumstances, by Del Webb due to the
employees permanent disability or (3) by the employee
for good reason. Each employment agreement

provides that in such event the employee will be entitled to
receive a lump sum cash payment equal to 2.5 times (except for
Mr. Hanneman, whose severance multiplier is 3 times) the
sum of the employees current base salary plus the greatest
of (a) the average annual incentive compensation paid to
the employee pursuant to Del Webbs incentive plan with
respect to the five fiscal years preceding the fiscal year in
which the change in control occurs, (b) the incentive
compensation paid to the employee during the twelve months prior
to the effective date of termination or (c) an amount equal
to the current base salary paid to such employee multiplied by
such employees current target bonus percentage under Del
Webbs incentive plan. The employee will also be entitled
to a payment equal to 20% of base salary in lieu of specified
fringe benefits, as well as continued use of an automobile,
continued coverage under life, disability, accident and group
health plans and continuation of any active country club
membership for 30 months (36 months, in the case of
Mr. Hanneman) following termination.

Change In Control Agreements.  
Del Webb also has
change in control agreements with other executive officers,
corporate officers and key employees. Pursuant to these change
in control agreements, the employee is entitled to receive
severance benefits. For the executive officers (as defined for
Securities and Exchange Commission reporting purposes), if,
within 24 months following a change in control of Del Webb,
the employee is terminated (other than due to the
employees death, disability or retirement) (1) by Del
Webb without cause or (2) by the employee for good reason,
each change in control agreement provides that the employee will
be entitled to receive a lump sum cash payment equal to two
times the sum of (a) the highest annual base salary in
effect for the employee at any time during the twelve months
prior to the notice of termination plus (b) an amount equal
to the greater of the value of all bonuses paid to the employee
during the twelve month period prior to termination or the
employees current target bonus under the management
incentive plan. The employee will also be entitled to a payment
equal to 20% of base salary in lieu of specified fringe
benefits, as well as continued use of an automobile and
continued coverage under life, disability, accident and group
health plans for one year following termination.

Supplemental Executive Retirement Plans.  
Del Webb
has two Supplemental Executive Retirement Plans, SERP
I and SERP II. Under the SERPs, executives of
Del Webb and its subsidiaries, as designated by Del Webbs
chief executive officer or the board of directors in the case of
the chief executive officer, are eligible to receive benefits
upon their retirement, death, disability, or termination of
employment. All Del Webb executive officers are participants in
the SERPs. Mr. Spencer is a participant of SERP I and
Messrs. Hanneman, Gleason, Pankratz, Schreiner and Jones
and Ms. Mariucci are participants of SERP II. The
benefits under SERP I are payable to Mr. Spencer
without early retirement reduction at age 58, if he remains
employed until age 58. The benefits under SERP II are
payable to Mr. Hanneman without early retirement reduction
at age 60, to Messrs. Gleason, Pankratz and Schreiner
and Ms. Mariucci without early retirement reduction at
age 62, if they remain employed until age 62, and to
Mr. Jones and other executive officers, without early
retirement reduction at age 65.

Both SERPs contain a change in control provision that provides
that if a participant terminates his employment for good reason
or is terminated for any reason other than death, disability,
retirement or cause within three years after a change in control
of Del Webb, the participant would be fully vested, credited
with the lesser of 20 years of service or the number of
years of service the participant would have as of his or her
normal retirement date and deemed to be the greater of
age 55 or the participants actual age. Using these
parameters, the benefit would be calculated and paid as an
actuarial equivalent lump sum as of the greater of age 55
or the participants actual age, discounted back to the
participants actual age if less than 55. Following a
change in control, absent termination by the participant for
good reason or by Del Webb without cause, both SERPs allow a
participant or beneficiary to elect to receive a lump sum
distribution of all or a portion of the participants
unpaid benefits, subject to a 10% penalty.

Other corporate officers and key personnel are participants in
SERP II and may be entitled to similar payments.

Payments Accruing at Closing.  
The payments
described in this section are being provided pursuant to
long-standing agreements and plans in place with executive
officers and reflect between nine and 27 years

of service by such officers. A significant portion of the
payments are in lieu of benefits that had accrued or would have
continued to accrue irrespective of the merger.

Because of the change in status of certain Del Webb executive
officers as a result of the merger, Pulte has acknowledged that
Messrs. Hanneman, Gleason, Spencer, Pankratz, Schreiner and
Jones and Ms. Mariucci are entitled to, and shall receive,
upon completion of the merger or at such other dates on which
the executive and Pulte agree, and regardless of whether they
continue as employees of Del Webb following the merger, payment
of the amounts provided for under the provisions of the
agreements and plans described above as if terminated by Del
Webb without cause. The exact amount payable to each employee
under such agreements cannot be determined until the amount of
each employees incentive compensation for fiscal year 2001
is determined and the date of the closing of the merger is
determined. As described under the heading Incentive
Compensation below, the incentive compensation of
Mr. Hanneman is discretionary with the board of directors,
provided certain objective measurements have been achieved. The
incentive compensation of the other executive officers is based
upon a formula, but is subject to discretionary increases or
decreases by the chief executive officer or the board of
directors.

None of the payments described in this section include any
gross-up payments to which the executives are
entitled as provided in the employment agreements and change in
control agreements described above, if necessary to make the
employees whole in the event any excise tax is imposed by the
Internal Revenue Code on the payments made.

Amendments to Employment and Change of Control
Agreements.  
At the request of Pulte, each of
Messrs. Hanneman, Gleason, Spencer, Pankratz, Schreiner and
Jones and Ms. Mariucci entered into an amendment to his or
her employment or change in control agreement prior to the final
consideration and approval of the merger agreement and the
transactions contemplated by the merger agreement by the Del
Webb board of directors. Pursuant to these amendments, each
employee has agreed either to continue as an employee of Del
Webb or to become an as-needed consultant to Del Webb for a
period beginning on the closing of the merger and ending on the
earlier of (1) the first anniversary of the closing of the
merger or (2) the termination due to employees death
or disability. In consideration for continuing employment or
serving as a consultant, Mr. Hanneman will receive a fee of
$1,000,000 and each of Messrs. Spencer, Schreiner,
Pankratz, Gleason and Jones and Ms. Mariucci will receive a
fee of $600,000, all upon the first anniversary of the closing
of the merger. No fee will be paid if the merger agreement is
terminated.

In addition, each has agreed that until the end of such period
he or she will not engage in a competing business
(generally, conventional or age restricted homebuilding and
development, but as defined in the amended agreements) within a
100 mile area in which any of the businesses of Del Webb are
being conducted on the date of termination of the amendment or
within 100 miles of any area in which Del Webbs
strategic plan discusses the possibility of conducting business
within two years of the termination of the amendment. Each has
also agreed not to solicit employees of Del Webb until the end
of such period.

Chairman of the Board.  
Mr. Dion retired from
active employment in November 1999, and continues as the
chairman of the board and a consultant to Del Webb. Pursuant to
an Employment and Consulting Agreement, dated July 10,
1996, as amended, Mr. Dion is entitled to specified
payments over the term of his agreement. The merger agreement
provides that Mr. Dion will be paid such amounts due him at
the closing of the merger in satisfaction of Del Webbs
obligations under his consulting agreement. Such amounts
include: the remaining unpaid balance of his annual $250,000
consulting fee through November 2001; an amount equal to
the cost of obtaining lifetime medical insurance coverage
equivalent to the coverage currently in force for Mr. Dion
and his spouse; payment to an insurance company equal to the
amount of unpaid premiums for split dollar life insurance
purchased in lieu of benefits to which Mr. Dion was
otherwise entitled at his retirement and of $100,000 to
Mr. Dion to defray the cost to him of his portion of the
premiums for such policy; and an office and clerical support
through December 2001. Pursuant to Mr. Dions
consulting agreement, the Del Webb board of directors will
consider paying additional compensation to Mr. Dion in
connection with the events described under the section captioned
The Merger  Background of the Merger and
the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement.

Incentive Compensation.  
Del Webb historically has
granted annual incentive compensation awards to its executive
officers. Del Webbs incentive compensation awards are a
significant component of management compensation, reflecting Del
Webbs belief that compensation should be linked to
performance. Pursuant to the 2001 Executive Management Incentive
Plan and the 2001 Management Incentive Plan, Del Webb will make
incentive compensation awards with respect to its fiscal year
ended June 30, 2001, to management in the ordinary course
of business and expects to do so prior to the completion of the
merger. Under the 2001 Management Incentive Plan, incentive
compensation awards to the executive officers, other than
Mr. Hanneman, are based on the financial performance
(consolidated net earnings and return on invested capital) of
the entire company. The compensation committee of the Del Webb
board of directors has determined target incentive compensation
awards for each such executive officer, and for fiscal year 2001
these targets, other than for Mr. Hanneman, were set at
between 50% and 75% of annual base salary. Incentive
compensation under this formula can range from 0% to 200% of the
target. In addition, the chief executive officer has discretion
to award an additional amount equal to 0.75% of net income for
fiscal year 2001 (which discretionary amount is expected to be
approximately $600,000 to $700,000) to Management Incentive Plan
participants, which could include one or more executive officers.

Mr. Hannemans incentive compensation award under the
2001 Executive Management Incentive Plan is based on one or more
of three criteria established by the human resources committee
of the Del Webb board of directors: (1) after-tax net
earnings, (2) return on invested capital percentage and
(3) Del Webbs ranking within its peer group for
return on equity. Based upon these criteria, the maximum
incentive compensation award that can be made to
Mr. Hanneman is the lesser of $3,000,000 or 1.75% of
pre-tax, pre-incentive earnings. The committee has discretion to
reduce or eliminate the amount of Mr. Hannemans
incentive compensation award on the basis of subjective factors
that the committee determines to be appropriate.

Incentive compensation awards for fiscal year 2001 have not yet
been determined but are expected to be approximately equal to or
higher than incentive compensation awards for prior years due to
Del Webbs improved financial performance.

Regulatory Clearances and Approvals

Pulte and Del Webb cannot complete the merger until they give
notification and furnish information to the Federal Trade
Commission and the Antitrust Division of the Department of
Justice and observe a statutory waiting period requirement.
Pulte and Del Webb filed the required notification and report
forms with the Federal Trade Commission and the Antitrust
Division on June 15, 2001, and the waiting period will
expire on July 16, 2001, unless early termination is
granted. At any time before or after the effective time of the
merger, and notwithstanding that the waiting period may have
expired or been terminated or the merger may have been
completed, the Federal Trade Commission, the Antitrust Division
or any state could take any action under the applicable
antitrust or competition laws as it deems necessary or
desirable. Private parties may also institute legal actions
under the antitrust laws under some circumstances.

No Dissenters or Appraisal Rights

Del Webb stockholders and Pulte shareholders are not entitled to
dissenters or appraisal rights in connection with the
merger.

New York Stock Exchange Listing

Both Pulte common shares and Del Webb common stock are listed on
the New York Stock Exchange. As a result of the merger, Del Webb
common stock will be delisted from the New York Stock Exchange
and will no longer have an active trading market. It is
expected, and is a condition to the consummation of the merger,
that the Pulte common shares that will be issued to Del Webb
stockholders in the merger will be listed on the New York Stock
Exchange.

Debt Financing

Immediately after the completion of the merger, Pulte intends to
cause Del Webb to call approximately $100 million of
publicly held Del Webb debt pursuant to its terms. Also, as a
result of the merger, the holders of an additional approximately
$600 million of publicly held Del Webb debt will be
entitled to require Del Webb to repurchase that debt within
approximately 30 days after the merger is completed. With
respect to any of such debt which the holders do not require Del
Webb to repurchase, Pulte intends to cause Del Webb to call the
debt as soon as is possible pursuant to its terms. In addition,
as a result of the merger, the outstanding balances under Del
Webbs principal credit agreement will become due. On
June 22, 2001, the outstanding balance under this credit
agreement was approximately $261 million.

Pulte expects to receive commitments from financial institutions
which Pulte believes will provide, together with its existing
credit facilities, sufficient funds for Del Webb to use to
refinance the foregoing indebtedness and for Pulte to use for
merger related purposes, including transaction costs, and for
its (including Del Webbs) ongoing operating and general
corporate needs.

Under its credit facilities, Pulte will be required to cause Del
Webb to guarantee such indebtedness. In exchange for such
guarantee, Pulte intends to guarantee Del Webbs remaining
outstanding indebtedness after the contemplated transactions
above, as permitted under Pultes existing indebtedness.

In addition, to the extent necessary, Pulte intends to
contribute sufficient equity capital to Del Webb at the
effective time of the merger such that Del Webbs
consolidated tangible net worth (as defined in its outstanding
indentures) will not decrease as a result of the merger, as
required by such indentures.

THE MERGER AGREEMENT

This section is a summary of the material terms of the merger
agreement, a copy of which is attached as Annex I to this Joint
Proxy Statement/ Prospectus. The following description does not
purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by
reference to the merger agreement. Pulte shareholders and Del
Webb stockholders should refer to the full text of the merger
agreement for details of the merger and the terms and conditions
of the merger agreement.

General

The merger agreement provides the legal framework for
Pultes acquisition of the outstanding shares of Del Webb
common stock through a merger of a wholly owned subsidiary of
Pulte into Del Webb. It covers, among other things:

 

	the effective time and effects of the merger;

 

	what Del Webb stockholders will receive;

 

	the treatment of outstanding Del Webb options and restricted
	stock;

 

	representations and warranties of the parties;

 

	agreements as to what the parties must do and not do prior to
	the effective time of the merger;

 

	conditions that must be fulfilled before each party is obligated
	to complete the merger; and

 

	the circumstances under which the merger agreement may be
	terminated and the effect of termination.

The following sections briefly summarize each of the above
categories. For a more complete understanding of the contents of
the merger agreement, please see the merger agreement itself,
which is attached to this Joint Proxy Statement/ Prospectus as
Annex I and is incorporated into this document by reference.

Effective Time

The merger will become effective when a certificate of merger is
filed with the Secretary of State of Delaware. This is expected
to occur on the first business day after the day on which all
the conditions to the obligations of the parties specified in
the merger agreement are fulfilled, but the day may be changed
by the parties. It is likely the last substantive condition to
be fulfilled will be obtaining the votes at the shareholder
meetings that are the subject of this Joint Proxy Statement/
Prospectus. Therefore, it is likely that the latest time at
which the merger will be effective will be on the first business
day after the day on which the Pulte and Del Webb shareholders
meetings are held. At the effective time of the merger, a wholly
owned subsidiary of Pulte will be merged with and into Del Webb,
and the separate corporate existence of the Pulte subsidiary
will terminate. Del Webb will be the surviving corporation in
the merger and become a wholly owned subsidiary of Pulte.

Corporation Organization and Governance

After the merger, the Certificate of Incorporation of Del Webb
will become the Certificate of Incorporation of the surviving
corporation and the By-Laws of the Pulte subsidiary will become
the By-Laws of the surviving corporation.

The directors of Pulte Acquisition Corporation will, upon
completion of the merger, become the directors of the surviving
corporation until their respective successors are elected and
qualified or until their earlier removal or resignation in
accordance with the By-Laws of the surviving corporation. The
officers of Del Webb will, upon completion of the merger, become
the officers of the surviving corporation until their respective
successors are elected and qualified or until their earlier
removal or resignation in accordance with the By-Laws of the
surviving corporation.

The Pulte board of directors has agreed to elect to the Pulte
board, upon completion of the merger, three persons designated
by Del Webb to serve until the next annual meeting of Pulte
shareholders. Pulte has also agreed to cause two of the Del Webb
designees to be nominated for election to the Pulte board at
Pultes next annual shareholder meeting, one in the class
the term of which expires in 2003 and the other in the class the
term of which expires in 2004.

Exchange of Shares

If the merger is completed, each outstanding share of Del Webb
common stock will be converted into Pulte common shares. The
exact number of Pulte common shares a Del Webb stockholder will
receive will be based on the average last sale price of Pulte
common shares for the 15 trading days ending on, and including,
the third trading day prior to the Del Webb special meeting. The
following table shows the number of Pulte common shares that a
Del Webb Stockholder will receive for each share of Del Webb
common stock, based on the average last sale price of Pulte
common shares:

Average Last Sale Price

Pulte Common Shares

of a Pulte Common Share

Issued for Each Del Webb Share

$45.04 or higher

0.866 shares

$39.00 to $45.03

Fraction of a share having a

calculated value (using the

average last sale price) of $39.00

$33.00 to $38.99

1.0 share

$30.00 to $32.99

Shares having a calculated value (using the
	average last sale price)

of $33.00

Less than $30.00

1.1 shares

In the event that the average last sale price of a Pulte common
share is less than $27.00, Del Webb may terminate the merger
agreement. The market value of the Pulte common shares that a
Del Webb stockholder receives upon completion of the merger may
be greater or less than the calculated value.

No fractional Pulte common shares will be issued as merger
consideration. Instead, any fractional share that would be
issued will be converted into cash equal to the last sale price
of Pulte common shares on the date of the merger multiplied by
the fraction of a share that would otherwise be issued.

Promptly after the merger is completed, Del Webb will cause each
record holder of Del Webb common stock to be mailed instructions
and a letter of transmittal for exchanging their Del Webb stock
certificates for Pulte share certificates. In order to receive
Pulte share certificates, a holder of Del Webb stock
certificates will have to complete and sign the letter of
transmittal and return it, together with such holders Del
Webb stock certificates, pursuant to the instructions provided.

Del Webb Stock Options and Restricted Stock

Each option to purchase Del Webb common stock which is
outstanding upon the completion of the merger will accelerate
and vest and, at the election of the holder, will become a right
to receive cash equal to the calculated value of the Pulte
common shares (based on the average last sale price as described
in the section captioned The Merger Agreement 
Exchange of Shares) which would be issued in the merger
for each share of Del Webb common stock, less the per share
exercise price of the option, multiplied by the number of shares
of Del Webb common stock issuable upon exercise of the option
or, if the holder does not so elect, will be converted into an
option to acquire Pulte common shares.

If a holder elects to receive cash, the holder must deliver to
Del Webb prior to the date of the Del Webb special meeting
(1) any certificate or option agreement relating to the
option and (2) a document in which the holder acknowledges
that the payment the holder is receiving is in full satisfaction
of any right the holder may have under or with regard to the
option.

If the holder does not elect to receive cash, an option to
purchase Del Webb common stock will, upon completion of the
merger, be converted into an immediately exercisable option to
acquire Pulte common shares on the same terms and conditions as
otherwise applied to the option prior to the completion of the
merger. Each converted option will be exercisable for the number
of Pulte common shares determined by multiplying the number of
shares of Del Webb common stock subject to the option prior to
the completion of the merger by the exchange ratio, rounded to
the nearest whole Pulte common share, if necessary. The exercise
price for a converted option after the completion of the merger
will be the per share exercise price of the option divided by
the exchange ratio. The exchange ratio is the number of Pulte
common shares that each share of Del Webb common stock would be
converted into as a result of the merger.

Upon completion of the merger, Del Webb restricted stock will
accelerate and vest in accordance with its terms.

respective directors, officers, employees and other agents may
not directly or indirectly:

 

	solicit, initiate, or knowingly facilitate or encourage any
	inquiry, offer or proposal by a third party with respect to, or
	that could reasonably be expected to lead to, an alternative
	acquisition transaction with respect to Del Webb; or

 

	negotiate or communicate with any third party with respect to
	any possible alternative acquisition transaction with respect to

	contemplated transactions.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, Del Webb may respond to an
unsolicited proposal by a third party but only if:

 

	Del Webbs board of directors determines in good faith,
	after consultation with its financial advisor, that the third
	party is financially capable of completing the transaction and,
	if completed, that transaction would result in a greater value
	to Del Webb stockholders than the merger and would be more
	favorable to Del Webb and its stockholders than the merger; and

 

	before furnishing or disclosing any non-public information to,
	or entering into discussions or negotiations with, such third
	party, Del Webb receives from the third party an executed
	confidentiality agreement with terms no less favorable to Del
	Webb than that executed by Pulte and Del Webb.

Del Webb will:

 

	no later than the end of the first business day after it
	receives an inquiry, proposal or offer from a third party for,
	or a request for non-public information relating to Del Webb or
	access to the properties, books or records of Del Webb or any of
	its subsidiaries in connection with, a possible alternative
	acquisition transaction, notify Pulte in writing of the inquiry,
	proposal, offer or request and identity of the third party and
	the terms and conditions of the proposal or offer;

 

	promptly notify Pulte of any determination by Del Webbs
	board of directors that Del Webb should furnish information to,
	or engage in discussions or negotiations with, any third party;

	negotiations with any third party.

transaction.

Pulte and its subsidiaries and their
respective directors, officers, employees and other agents may

	communicate with any third party with respect to any possible
	acquisition transaction with respect to Pulte, or enter into,

Termination of the Merger Agreement; Effect of Termination

The merger agreement may be terminated:

 

	by mutual written consent of Pulte and Del Webb;

 

	by Pulte or Del Webb if:

 

	any of the representations and warranties of the other party
	contained in the merger agreement was not complete and accurate
	in all material respects (or that any of those representations
	and warranties which are qualified as to materiality or absence
	of material adverse effect were not true and correct in all
	respects) on the date of the merger agreement;

 

	the other party has breached in a material respect any covenant
	or agreement contained in the merger agreement and has not cured
	that breach within ten business days after written notice from
	the other party, or upon the completion of the merger, if
	earlier;

 

	without fault of the terminating party, the merger is not
	completed by September 30, 2001 (this date may be extended
	by mutual consent of the parties);

 

	any court of competent jurisdiction or other governmental
	authority issues a final, nonappealable order, decree or ruling
	prohibiting the merger;

 

	the Del Webb stockholders fail to approve and adopt the merger
	agreement and the transactions contemplated by the merger
	agreement at the Del Webb special meeting or the shareholders of
	Pulte fail to approve the share issuance at the Pulte special
	meeting; or

 

	the other partys board of directors withdraws, changes or
	modifies in any manner its recommendation to its stockholders
	with regard to the merger or the share issuance, as applicable;

 

	by Pulte if Del Webbs board of directors adopts
	resolutions approving or otherwise authorizing or recommending
	an alternative acquisition proposal with regard to Del Webb; or

 

	by Del Webb if:

 

	Pultes board of directors adopts resolutions approving or
	otherwise authorizing or recommending an acquisition proposal
	with regard to Pulte that would impede, delay or prevent
	completion of the merger;

 

	Del Webbs board of directors, after consultation with its
	legal and financial advisors, has determined in good faith that
	approving and entering into an agreement in connection with a
	third party proposal and consummating such proposal would result
	in a transaction more favorable to its stockholders from a
	financial point of view than the transactions contemplated by
	the merger agreement; provided that (1) Del Webb has
	provided Pulte with at least five business days notice of
	such termination and (2) concurrently Del Webb pays Pulte a
	termination fee of $32 million plus Pultes
	out-of-pocket expenses up to $5 million; or

	section captioned The Merger Agreement 
	Exchange of Shares) of a Pulte common share is less than
	$27.00 and Del Webb has provided written notice to Pulte of its
	irrevocable election (unless Pulte consents in writing to such
	notice being withdrawn by Del Webb) to terminate the merger
	agreement.

If the shareholders of either party fail to approve the merger
or either of their respective boards of directors changes its
recommendation that its shareholders approve the merger or
adopts resolutions recommending an alternative acquisition
transaction, then that party shall be required to reimburse the
other party for its out-of-pocket expenses up to $5 million.

If the merger is terminated where expenses are payable to Pulte,
and prior to Del Webbs special meeting an alternative
acquisition proposal with respect to Del Webb has been publicly
announced and within twelve months of the termination of the
merger agreement Del Webb completes or enters into an

agreement with respect to an alternative acquisition proposal
that would result in a transaction more favorable to Del
Webbs stockholders from a financial point of view than the
merger, Del Webb would be required to pay to Pulte a termination
fee of $32 million.

Amendments

The merger agreement may be amended by an agreement in writing
signed by both Pulte and Del Webb at any time before or after
the merger is approved by the Pulte and Del Webb shareholders.
After the merger is approved, no amendment may be made which, by
law or in accordance with the rules of any relevant stock
exchange, would require further approval by the Pulte and Del
Webb shareholders unless Pulte and Del Webb obtain that approval.

Compensation and Benefits

Pulte has agreed to consult with the senior executives of Del
Webb prior to the effective time of the merger to develop
employee benefit plans that will provide Del Webbs
employees with benefits substantially the same, in the
aggregate, as those they are currently receiving under Del
Webbs employee benefit plans and to maintain those plans
for at least one year following the consummation of the merger.

Del Webb Directors and Officers Insurance and
Indemnification

Pulte and Del Webb will, upon completion of the merger,
indemnify anyone who was a director, officer or employee of Del
Webb or any of its subsidiaries, to the fullest extent permitted
by law, against any liabilities and expenses relating to any
acts or omissions in those capacities at or before the
completion of the merger, to the same extent provided in Del
Webbs Certificate of Incorporation or By-Laws, or any
indemnification agreements, in effect at the date of the merger
agreement. Pulte and Del Webb will also pay all reasonable
expenses, including attorneys fees, incurred by an
indemnified person in enforcing the indemnity obligations of
Pulte and Del Webb.

Pulte will also cause Del Webb to keep Del Webbs directors
and officers liability insurance policies in effect for six
years after the completion of the merger, provided that Pulte
may substitute policies having the same coverage and amounts and
containing terms no less favorable to the persons currently
covered and with comparable carriers, and neither Pulte nor Del
Webb will be required to pay annual premiums in excess of three
times the annual premium paid by Del Webb during 2001. If Pulte
and Del Webb cannot maintain the required insurance for an
annual premium of that amount, they will purchase the maximum
coverage which can be obtained for that amount.

UNAUDITED PRO FORMA COMBINED CONDENSED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS

The following unaudited pro forma combined condensed financial
statements give effect to the merger. The merger will be
accounted for as a purchase of Del Webb by Pulte. The unaudited
pro forma combined condensed financial statements reflects the
financial position of Pulte and Del Webb as of March 31,
2001, and the operations of Pulte and Del Webb for the three
months and year ended March 31, 2001 and December 31,
2000, respectively. The unaudited pro forma combined condensed
balance sheet assumes the merger occurred on the date of the
balance sheet. The unaudited pro forma combined statement of
earnings assumes the merger occurred on January 1, 2000.

The historical financial information about Pulte and Del Webb as
of March 31, 2001, and for the three months and year ended
March 31, 2001, and December 31, 2000, respectively,
has been derived from the Pulte and Del Webb audited and
unaudited financial statements. The unaudited pro forma combined
condensed financial statements should be read in conjunction
with the accompanying notes and with the historical consolidated
financial statements of Pulte and Del Webb, which are
incorporated into this Joint Proxy Statement/ Prospectus by
reference.

The unaudited pro forma combined condensed financial statements
reflect an exchange ratio of 0.907 based on a price of $42.99,
the average last sale price for the 15 trading days prior
to, and including, May 31, 2001. For purchase accounting
purposes, the assumed Pulte shares issued are valued at $40.40
per share which was the closing price on May 31, 2001. The
actual exchange ratio and acquisition adjustments will be
determined at or after the completion of the transaction, and
they may differ from those reflected in the unaudited pro forma
combined condensed financial statements.

The unaudited pro forma combined condensed financial statements
have been included for comparative purposes only. As further
discussed in the accompanying notes, the unaudited pro forma
combined condensed financial statements do not purport to show
what the financial position or operating results would have been
if the merger had been consummated as of the dates indicated and
should not be construed as representative of future financial
position or operating results.

	Webbs unsecured senior subordinated debentures and
	$170,000 of Del Webbs unsecured short-term borrowings.

(9) 

	To adjust the Del Webb unsecured senior subordinated debentures
	to the estimated fair value by $45,794 based on Pultes
	anticipated interest rate.

(10) 

	To eliminate Del Webbs shareholders equity of
	$546,130, to record the payment of cash of $34,410 for the Del
	Webb stock options (assuming all holders elect to receive cash),
	and to record the issuance of 17,245 shares of Pulte stock,
	valued for purchase accounting purposes at $696,719 based on a
	price of $40.40 which is the closing price on May 31, 2001.

	exchange ratio of 0.907 based on a price of $42.99, the average
	last sale price for the 15 days prior to, and including,
	May 31, 2001. The actual exchange ratio and value of shares
	exchanged will be based on the average last sale price of Pulte
	common shares for the 15 trading days ending on, and
	including, the third trading day prior to the special meeting of
	Del Webb stockholders.

	usual and regular course of its business, the MBCA does not
	require shareholder approval. However, where such a sale, lease
	or exchange is not in the usual and the regular course of
	business, the MBCA requires approval by holders of a majority of
	the outstanding shares of the corporation entitled to vote.

The DGCL requires
	the approval of the directors and the vote of holders of a
	majority of the outstanding stock entitled to vote on the sale,
	lease or exchange of all or substantially all of a
	corporations property and assets, or a merger or
	consolidation of the corporation into any other corporation.

Interested Shareholder Business Combinations

Pulte has elected,
	by its articles, not to be governed by Chapter 7A of the
	Michigan Business Corporation Act, which restricts the ability
	of certain persons to acquire control of a corporation.

	     Pultes Articles of
	Incorporation provide that the affirmative vote of at least
	69.3% of the shares voting on a proposed business combination at
	a shareholders meeting shall be required for the:

	     1. merger or consolidation
	with a person who beneficially owns, directly or indirectly, ten
	percent or more of the voting power of outstanding Pulte stock,
	or an affiliate of Pulte who, within two years prior to the date
	in question, has owned, directly or indirectly, ten percent or
	more of the voting power of outstanding Pulte stock (in either
	case, an Interested Shareholder) or another
	corporation, which is, or after the merger or consolidation,
	would be an affiliate of an Interested Shareholder that was an
	Interested Shareholder prior to the transaction;

	     2. sale, lease, transfer, or
	other disposition of Pultes assets (equaling at least 10%
	of the aggregate net worth of the corporation) to an Interested
	Shareholder or an affiliate of an Interested Shareholder out of
	the ordinary course of business;

	     3. issuance or transfer of
	equity securities totaling more than 5% of the total market
	value of outstanding shares to an Interested Shareholder or an
	affiliate of an Interested Shareholder in any twelve- month
	period, except exercise of warrants or rights to purchase
	securities offered pro rata to all shareholders;

	     4. adoption of any plan for
	dissolution or liquidation by or on behalf of an Interested
	Shareholder or an affiliate of an Interested Shareholder;

The DGCL provides
	that, subject to certain restrictions, if a person acquires 15%
	or more of the stock of a Delaware corporation without the
	approval of the corporations board (thereby becoming an
	Interested Stockholder) such person may not engage
	in certain transactions with the corporation for a period of
	three years.

	     The DGCL includes certain
	exceptions to this prohibition; for example, if the board of
	directors approves the acquisition of stock or the transaction
	prior to the time that the person became an Interested
	Stockholder, or if the Interested Stockholder acquires 85% of
	the voting stock of the corporation (excluding voting stock
	owned by directors who are also officers and certain employee
	stock plans) in one transaction, or if the transaction is
	approved by the board and by the affirmative vote of two-thirds
	of the outstanding voting stock which is not owned by the
	Interested Stockholder.

	     Del Webb also may be subject to
	the Arizona Corporate Takeovers statute, Business Combinations
	(Sections 10-2741 through 10-2743).

5. any
	reclassification of securities which has the effect of
	increasing the amount of outstanding shares of any class
	directly or indirectly held by any Interested Shareholder or any
	affiliate of an Interested Shareholder.

	     This consent is not required
	if:

	     1. the board of directors has
	approved the business combination and either

	        a. the
	Interested Shareholder has been an Interested Shareholder
	continuously for a period of at least two years prior to the
	date on which the board of directors approved such business
	combination or

	        b. such
	proposed transaction was approved by the board of directors
	prior to the time that the Interested Shareholder became an
	Interested Shareholder; or

	     2. a majority of the
	outstanding shares of stock of such other corporation is owned
	of record or beneficially, directly or indirectly, by Pulte or
	its subsidiaries.

	     The provisions of Pultes
	articles requiring a super majority vote for business
	combinations may not be altered, amended, changed or repealed
	and no provision inconsistent with the intent or purpose of such
	provisions may be adopted without the affirmative vote of 69.3%
	of the shares voting at a meeting of shareholders, in addition
	to the vote otherwise required by the MBCA.

Control Share Acquisition

Under
	Chapter 7B of the MBCA, an entity that acquires Control
	Shares (as defined below) of a corporation in a control share
	acquisition may vote the Control Shares on any matter only if a
	majority of all shares, and of all non-Interested Shares (as
	defined below), of each class of shares entitled to vote as a
	class approve such voting rights.

	     Interested Shares are shares owned
	by officers of a corporation, employee-directors of a
	corporation and the entity making the control share
	acquisition.

	     Control Shares are shares, that,
	when added to shares already owned by the entity, would give the
	entity voting power in the election of directors over any of
	three thresholds: one-fifth, one-third and a majority.

	     The effect of the statute is to
	condition the acquisition of voting control of a corporation on
	the approval of a majority of the pre-existing disinterested
	shareholders.

Delaware does not
	have a control share acquisition statute.

	     Del Webb has opted out of the
	Arizona Corporate Takeovers statute, Control Share Acquisitions
	(Sections 10-2721 through 10-2727).

Number of Directors; Vacancies

Pultes board
	may consist of three to fifteen directors. Currently there are
	nine members of Pultes board. Under the merger agreement,
	it is a condition to the consummation of the merger that three
	persons designated by Del Webb will be added to Pultes
	board.

	     Vacancies on Pultes board
	may be filled by a majority vote of Pultes board. A
	director elected by Pultes board to fill a vacancy holds
	office until the next meeting of shareholders called for the
	election of directors and until his or her successor is elected
	and qualified.

	     Newly created directorships
	resulting from an increase in the number of directors and any
	vacancy on the board for any reason whatsoever is filled only by
	an affirmative vote of a majority of the board then in office.
	If the number of directors then in office is less than a quorum,
	the newly created directorships and vacancies are filled by the
	affirmative vote of a majority of the directors then in office,
	although less than a quorum, or by the sole remaining director.

Del Webbs
	board may consist of nine to twelve directors. Currently there
	are eleven members of Del Webbs board.

	     Vacancies in the board resulting
	from an increase in the number of directors may be filled by the
	affirmative vote of a majority of the board then in office;
	provided that a quorum is present, and any other vacancy
	occurring in the board may be filled by the affirmative vote of
	a majority of the directors then in office, even if less than a
	quorum, or by a sole remaining director.

	     Any director of any class elected
	to fill a vacancy resulting from an increase in a class shall
	hold office for a term that coincides with the remaining term of
	that class. Any director elected to fill a vacancy not resulting
	from an increase in the number of directors shall have the same
	remaining term as his or her predecessor.

Indemnification of Directors

The MBCA generally
	permits indemnification of directors and officers for damages
	and expenses incurred by them by reason of their position with
	the corporation, if the director or officer has acted in good
	faith with the reasonable belief that his or her conduct was in
	the best interest of the corporation and not unlawful.

	     The MBCA permits a corporation to
	indemnify persons against judgments in actions brought by or in
	the right of the corporation.

The DGCL generally
	permits indemnification of directors and officers for damages
	and expenses incurred by them by reason of their position with
	the corporation, if the director or officer has acted in good
	faith with the reasonable belief that his or her conduct was in
	the best interest of the corporation and not unlawful.

	     The DGCL, however, does not permit
	a corporation to indemnify persons against judgments in actions
	brought by or in the right of the corporation unless the
	Delaware Court of Chancery approves the indemnification.

Shareholder Action

Pultes
	shareholders may take action by written consent.

	     The consent must be signed by the
	holders of outstanding stock having not less than the minimum
	number of votes necessary to authorize or take such action at a
	meeting at which all shares entitled to vote were present and
	voted.

	     Prompt notice of the taking of
	such action without a meeting by less than unanimous written
	consent shall be given to all shareholders.

Del Webbs
	stockholders may only act by vote at a meeting and may not act
	by written consent without a meeting.

Special Shareholder Meetings

Special meetings of
	shareholders may be called by Pultes board or its
	President or Secretary.

	     Under the MBCA, a court in which
	the principal place of business or registered office is located
	may order a special meeting upon the application of the holders
	of not less than ten percent of the outstanding Pulte shares
	entitled to vote at the special meeting, for good cause shown.

Special meetings of
	stockholders, for any purpose, may be called by either Del
	Webbs Chairman or the President and will be called by
	either such officer at the request, in writing, of a majority of
	the board of directors.

Appraisal Rights

The MBCA allows
	dissenting shareholders to obtain the fair value of their shares
	(so-called appraisal rights) by statute for a
	statutory merger, a sale or exchange of all or substantially all
	of the property of the corporation other than in the usual and
	regular course of business and for some amendments to the
	articles of incorporation.

Under the DGCL,
	appraisal rights may be available in connection with a statutory
	merger or consolidation in certain specific situations.

	     Appraisal rights are not available
	under the DGCL when a corporation is to be the surviving
	corporation and no vote of its stockholders is required to
	approve the merger.

The MBCA does not
	allow appraisal rights where the corporations shares are
	listed on a national securities exchange or designated as a
	national market system security on a interdealer quotation
	system by the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc.,
	nor are appraisal rights available in a merger transaction where
	shareholders receive cash or shares that satisfy this standard,
	or a sale or exchange of all or substantially all of the assets
	of the corporation in connection with a dissolution.

In addition, unless
	otherwise provided in the articles, no appraisal rights are
	available under the DGCL to holders of shares of any class of
	stock which is either:

	     a. listed on a national
	securities exchange or designated as national market system
	security on an inter-dealer quotation system by the National
	Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. or

	     b. held of record by more
	than 2,000 stockholders,

	unless such stockholders are required by the terms of the merger
	to accept anything other than:

	     1. shares of stock of the
	surviving corporation;

	     2. shares of stock of another
	corporation which are so listed on a national securities
	exchange or designated as a national mark system security on an
	inter-dealer quotation system by the National Association of
	Securities Dealers, Inc. or held of record by more than 2,000
	stockholders as of the effective date of the merger or
	consolidation;

	     3. cash in lieu of fractional
	shares of such stock; or

	     4. any combination
	thereof.

	     Appraisal rights are not available
	under the DGCL in the event of sale, lease or exchange of all or
	substantially all of Del Webbs assets or the adoption of
	an amendment to its articles.

Dividends

Pulte may pay
	dividends to its shareholders unless, after such a distribution,
	it would not be able to pay its debts as they become due in the
	usual course of business, or its total assets would be less than
	the sum of its total liabilities plus the amount that would be
	needed to satisfy the dissolution rights of shareholders whose
	preferential rights are superior to those receiving the
	distribution.

Del Webb may pay
	dividends to its stockholders out of surplus or out of net
	profits for the current and/or preceding fiscal year, provided
	that such dividends will not reduce capital below the aggregate
	amount of capital represented by the issued and outstanding
	stock of all classes having a preference upon the distribution
	of assets.

Share Repurchases

Under the MBCA,
	Pulte may acquire its own shares so long as after the
	acquisition there remains outstanding shares possessing,
	collectively, voting rights and unlimited rights to receive
	assets in dissolution.

Under the DGCL, a
	corporation may generally redeem or repurchase shares of its
	stock if such redemption or repurchase will not impair the
	capital of the corporation.

	     Del Webbs By-Laws provide
	that Del Webb shall not, directly or indirectly, purchase or
	agree to purchase any Del Webb equity security of a class which
	is registered pursuant to Section 12 of the Exchange Act
	for more than the average market price of the shares from any
	person or group of persons who is the beneficial owner of more
	than five percent of the aggregate voting power of Del Webb,
	unless:

	     1. the purchase or agreement
	to purchase is approved at a meeting of the stockholders by the
	affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the aggregate
	voting power of all shares entitled to vote, except that no
	outstanding shares of capital stock of Del Webb entitled to vote
	generally in the election of directors that are beneficially
	owned by any person that is the direct or indirect beneficial
	owner of more than five percent of the aggregate voting power of
	Del Webb shall be entitled to vote on the question of such
	approval or

	     2. Del Webb makes an offer of
	at least equal value per share to all holders of shares of the
	same class or series and to all holders of any class or series
	into which the securities may be converted.

UNITED STATES FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSEQUENCES OF THE
MERGER

The following is a summary of the United States federal income
tax consequences of the merger that are anticipated to be
material to U.S. holders of Del Webb common stock that exchange
such stock for Pulte common shares pursuant to the merger. This
summary addresses only such stockholders who hold their Del Webb
common stock as a capital asset and will hold Pulte common
shares received in exchange therefor as a capital asset. The
following summary is based upon the provisions of the Internal
Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, applicable Treasury
regulations thereunder, judicial decisions and current
administrative rulings, as of the date hereof, all of which are
subject to change, possibly on a retroactive basis and upon
assumptions, limitations, representations and covenants,
including those contained in certificates of officers of Del
Webb and Pulte expected to be executed as of the completion of
the merger. This summary does not address all United States
federal income tax consequences that may be relevant to
particular stockholders in light of their individual
circumstances or to stockholders that are subject to special
rules, such as rules relating to:

 

	financial institutions;

 

	tax-exempt organizations;

 

	insurance companies;

 

	dealers in securities;

 

	non-U.S. holders;

 

	stockholders who hold Del Webb common stock as part of a
	straddle, hedge, constructive sale, or conversion transaction;
	and

 

	stockholders who acquired their Del Webb common stock pursuant
	to the exercise of employee stock options or otherwise as
	compensation.

For purposes of this discussion, the term U.S.
holder means a holder of Del Webb common stock that is:

 

	a citizen or resident of the United States;

 

	a corporation or partnership created in or organized under the
	law of the United States or any of its political subdivisions;

 

	an estate the income of which is subject to United States
	federal income taxation regardless of its source; or

 

	a trust if (1) a United States court is able to exercise
	primary supervision over administration of the trust and one or
	more United States persons have authority to control all
	substantial decisions of the trust or (2) the trust was in
	existence on August 20, 1996, and properly elected to be
	treated as a United States person.

A non-U.S. holder is a holder of Del Webb common
stock that is not a U.S. holder.

This discussion is not intended to be a complete analysis or
description of all potential United States federal income tax
consequences of the merger. In addition, this discussion does
not address tax consequences which may vary with, or are
contingent on, your individual circumstances. This discussion,
moreover, does not address any non-income tax or any foreign,
state, or local tax consequences of the merger. Accordingly, you
are strongly urged to consult with your tax advisor to determine
the particular United States federal, state, local or foreign
income or other tax consequences to you of the merger.

Del Webb has received an opinion from its special counsel,
Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom LLP, a copy of
which has been filed with the SEC as an exhibit to the
registration statement related

to this Joint Proxy Statement/ Prospectus. Such opinion provides
to the effect that, for United States federal income tax
purposes:

 

	The merger will constitute a reorganization within
	the meaning of section  368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code
	of 1986, as amended;

 

	No gain or loss will be recognized by holders of Pulte common
	shares as a result of the merger;

 

	No gain or loss will be recognized by a holder of Del Webb
	common stock who exchanges all of his, her or its shares of Del
	Webb common stock solely for Pulte common shares pursuant to the
	merger (except with respect to cash received in lieu of a
	fractional share interest);

 

	The aggregate tax basis of the Pulte common shares received by a
	holder of Del Webb common stock pursuant to the merger will be
	equal to the aggregate tax basis of the Del Webb common stock
	surrendered in the merger (other than the tax basis allocable to
	a fractional Pulte common share for which cash is received);

 

	The holding period of the Pulte common shares received by a
	holder of Del Webb common stock pursuant to the merger will
	include the holding period of the Del Webb common stock
	surrendered in the merger;

 

	A holder of Del Webb common stock will be required to recognize
	gain or loss with respect to cash received in lieu of a
	fractional Pulte common share, measured by the difference
	between the amount of cash received and the portion of the tax
	basis of the holders shares of Del Webb common stock
	allocable to the fractional share, which gain or loss will be
	capital gain or loss if the holder of the Del Webb common stock
	holds such stock as a capital asset within the meaning of
	section 1221 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as
	amended and will be long-term capital gain or loss if the shares
	of Del Webb common stock exchanged for the fractional share were
	held for more than one year at the effective time of the merger;
	and

 

	No gain or loss will be recognized by Del Webb, Pulte or Pulte
	Acquisition Corporation as a result of the merger.

It is a condition to the obligation of Del Webb to complete the
merger that Del Webb receive an additional opinion from its
special counsel, Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher &
Flom LLP, at the closing of the merger, to the effect that,
based upon certain facts, representations, and assumptions, the
merger will constitute a reorganization within the
meaning of section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of
1986, as amended. The opinions delivered and to be delivered
have assumed and will assume the absence of certain changes in
the existing facts and relies on assumptions, representations,
and covenants made by Del Webb, Pulte and others, including
those contained in certificates of officers of Del Webb and
Pulte. If any of these factual assumptions is inaccurate, the
tax consequences of the merger could differ from those described
here. The opinions regarding the tax-free nature of the merger
neither bind the IRS nor preclude the IRS from adopting a
contrary position. Neither Del Webb nor Pulte intends to obtain
a ruling from the IRS with respect to the tax consequences of
the merger.

If the merger is not treated as a reorganization
within the meaning of section 368(a) of the Internal
Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, then each holder of Del Webb
common stock would recognize gain or loss equal to the
difference between the fair market value of the Pulte common
shares received (including any cash in lieu of a fractional
share) and such holders tax basis in the Del Webb common
stock surrendered in exchange therefor.

LEGAL MATTERS

The validity of the Pulte common shares to be issued in
connection with the merger will be passed upon for Pulte by
Honigman Miller Schwartz and Cohn LLP.

Certain of the tax consequences of the merger to Del Webb
stockholders will be passed upon by Skadden, Arps, Slate,
Meagher & Flom LLP.

PART II

INFORMATION NOT REQUIRED IN PROSPECTUS

Item 20.  Indemnification of Directors and
Officers

Under Sections 561-571 of the Michigan Business Corporation
Act, directors and officers of a Michigan corporation may be
entitled to indemnification by the corporation against
judgments, expenses, fines and amounts paid by the director or
officer in settlement of claims brought against them by third
persons or by or in the right of the corporation if those
directors and officers acted in good faith and in a manner
reasonably believed to be in, or not opposed to, the best
interests of the corporation or its shareholders.

Pultes Articles of Incorporation provide that its
directors shall not be personally liable to Pulte or its
shareholders for monetary damages for breach of the
directors fiduciary duty. However, Pultes Articles
do not eliminate or limit the liability of a director for any of
the following: (i) a breach of the directors duty of
loyalty to us or our shareholders; (ii) acts or omissions
not in good faith or that involve intentional misconduct or
knowing violation of law; (iii) a violation of
Section 551(1) of the Michigan Business Corporation Act;
(iv) a transaction from which the director derived an
improper personal benefit; or (v) an act or omission
occurring before the effective date of the Articles. In
addition, Pultes By-Laws generally provide that, to the
fullest extent permitted by applicable law, Pulte shall
indemnify any person who was or is a party or is threatened to
be made a party to any threatened, pending or completed action,
suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or
investigative (whether or not by or in the right of the
corporation), including a shareholders derivative action,
by reason of the fact that he is or was a Pulte director,
officer, employee or agent or is or was serving at Pultes
request as a director, officer, employee or agent of another
corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other
enterprise.

Pulte has obtained Directors and Officers liability
insurance. The policy provides for $25 million in coverage
including prior acts dating to Pultes inception and
liabilities under the Securities Act.

Item 22.  Undertakings

(a) The undersigned registrant hereby undertakes:

	(1)  That, for purposes of determining any liability under
	the Securities Act of 1933, each filing of the registrants
	annual report pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of
	the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 that is incorporated by
	reference in the registration statement shall be deemed to be a
	new registration statement relating to the securities offered
	therein, and the offering of such securities at that time shall
	be deemed to be the initial bona fide offering thereof.

II-2

	(2)  That prior to any public reoffering of the securities
	registered hereunder through use of a prospectus which is a part
	of this registration statement, by any person or party who is
	deemed to be an underwriter within the meaning of
	Rule 145(c), the issuer undertakes that such reoffering
	prospectus will contain the information called for by the
	applicable registration form with respect to reofferings by
	persons who may be deemed underwriters, in addition to the
	information called for by the other Items of the applicable form.

	(3)  That every prospectus (i) that is filed pursuant
	to paragraph (2) immediately preceding, or (ii) that
	purports to meet the requirements of Section 10(a)(3) of
	the Act and is used in connection with an offering of securities
	subject to Rule 415, will be filed as a part of an
	amendment to the registration statement and will not be used
	until such amendment is effective, and that, for purposes of
	determining any liability under the Securities Act of 1933, each
	such post-effective amendment shall be deemed to be a new
	registration statement relating to the securities offered
	therein, and the offering of such securities at that time shall
	be deemed to be the initial bona fide offering thereof.

(b) The undersigned registrant hereby undertakes to respond
to requests for information that is incorporated by reference
into the prospectus pursuant to Items 4, 10(b), 11,
or 13 of this Form, within one business day of receipt of
such request, and to send the incorporated documents by first
class mail to other equally prompt means. This includes
information contained in documents filed subsequent to the
effective date of the registration statement through the date of
responding to the request.

(c) The undersigned registrant hereby undertakes to supply
by means of a post-effective amendment all information
concerning a transaction, and the company being acquired
involved therein, that was not the subject of and included in
the registration statement when it became effective.

(d) Insofar as indemnification for liabilities under the
Securities Act of 1933 may be permitted to directors, officers
and controlling persons of the registrant pursuant to the
provisions discussed in Item 20 above, or otherwise, the
registrant has been advised that in the opinion of the
Securities and Exchange Commission such indemnification is
against public policy as expressed in the Securities Act of 1933
and is, therefor, unenforceable. In the event that a claim for
indemnification against such liabilities (other than the payment
by the registrant of expenses incurred or paid by a director,
officer or controlling person of the registrant in the
successful defense of any action, suit or proceeding) is
asserted by such director, officer or controlling person in
connection with the securities being registered, the registrant
will, unless in the opinion of its counsel the matter has been
settled by controlling precedent, submit to a court of
appropriate jurisdiction the question whether such
indemnification by it is against public policy as expressed in
the Securities Act of 1933 and will be governed by the final
adjudication of such issue.

II-3

April 30, 2001 (the Agreement), among Del Webb
Corporation (the Company), a Delaware corporation,
Pulte Corporation (Pulte), a Michigan corporation,
and Pulte Acquisition Corporation (Acquisition), a
Delaware corporation and a wholly-owned subsidiary of Pulte.

WHEREAS, the Boards of Directors of the Company and Pulte deem
it advisable and in the best interests of each corporation and
its respective stockholders that the Company and Pulte engage in
a business combination in order to advance the long-term
strategic business interests of the Company and Pulte.

WHEREAS, the combination of the Company and Pulte shall be
effected by the terms of this Agreement through a merger as
outlined below (the Merger).

WHEREAS, in furtherance thereof, the respective Boards of
Directors of the Company and Pulte have approved the Merger,
upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this
Agreement, pursuant to which each share of common stock, par
value $0.001 per share, of the Company (Company
Common Stock) issued and outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time (as defined in Section 2.3), other than
shares owned or held directly or indirectly by Pulte or directly
or indirectly by the Company, will be converted into the right
to receive shares of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of
Pulte (Pulte Common Stock) as set forth in
Article I.

WHEREAS, as a condition to the willingness of the Company to
enter into this Agreement, William J. Pulte and his
affiliated trusts (collectively, the Principal
Stockholder) and the Company have entered into a Voting
Agreement, dated as of the date hereof (the Voting
Agreement), providing, among other things, that the
Principal Stockholder will vote in favor of the Pulte Meeting

WHEREAS, for Federal income tax purposes, it is intended that
the Merger shall qualify as a reorganization within the meaning
of Section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as
amended (the Code), and this Agreement constitutes a

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the

hereby, the parties hereto agree as follows:

ARTICLE I

1.1  The Merger. Upon the terms and subject to the
conditions set forth in this Agreement, and in accordance with
the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware (the

continue as those of the Surviving Corporation, unaffected and
unimpaired by the Merger, (ii) the separate existence of
Acquisition will

other assets, rights, privileges, immunities, powers, purposes
and franchises will be merged into the Surviving Corporation,
which will succeed to and assume all the rights and obligations
of Acquisition in accordance with the DGCL, and (iii) the
Merger will have the other effects specified in the DGCL
(including, without limitation, Section 259 of the DGCL).

1.2  Certificate of Incorporation. From the Effective Time
until subsequently amended in accordance with applicable law,
the Certificate of Incorporation of the Company as in effect
immediately prior to the Effective Time will be the Certificate
of Incorporation of the Surviving Corporation.

1.3  By-Laws. The By-Laws of Acquisition as in effect
immediately prior to the Effective Time will be the By-Laws of
the Surviving Corporation from the Effective Time until they are
amended in accordance with their terms, the Certificate of
Incorporation of the Surviving Corporation and applicable law.

1.4  Directors. The directors of Acquisition immediately
prior to the Effective Time will be the directors of the
Surviving Corporation after the Effective Time and will serve in
accordance with the By-Laws of the Surviving Corporation until
their respective successors are elected and qualified, or until
such earlier time as they resign or are removed in accordance
with the By-Laws until the earlier of their resignation or
removal or otherwise ceasing to be a director or until their
respective successors are duly elected and qualified.

1.5  Officers. The officers of the Company immediately
before the Effective Time will be the officers of the Surviving
Corporation after the Effective Time and will hold office at the
pleasure of the Board of Directors, and in accordance with the
By-Laws of the Surviving Corporation until the earlier of their
resignation or removal or otherwise ceasing to be an officer or
until their respective successors are duly elected and
qualified, as the case may be.

1.6  Further Assurances. If at any time after the Effective
Time, the Surviving Corporation determines or is advised that
any deeds, bills of sale, assignments, assurances or other
actions or things are necessary or desirable to vest, perfect or
confirm of record or otherwise in the Surviving Corporation its
right, obligation, title or interest in, to or under any of the
rights, properties or assets of either the Company or
Acquisition acquired or to be acquired by the Surviving
Corporation as a result of, or in connection with, the Merger or
otherwise to carry out the transactions which are the subject of
this Agreement, the officers and directors of the Surviving
Corporation will be authorized to execute and deliver all
documents, in the name and on behalf of the Company, Acquisition
or otherwise, and to take all other actions and do all other
things as may be necessary or desirable to vest, perfect or
confirm any and all right, obligation, title and interest in, to
and under such rights, properties or assets in the Surviving
Corporation or otherwise to carry out the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

1.7  Stock of the Company.

(a)  Except as provided in Sections 1.7(e) and 1.7(f),
at the Effective Time each share of Company Common Stock which
is outstanding immediately before the Effective Time will be
converted into and become the right to receive, the number (the
Exchange Ratio) of shares of Pulte Common Stock,
described in Section 1.7(b) below (the Merger
Consideration).

(b)  The Merger Consideration for a share of Company Common
Stock will be as follows:

	(i)  If the Market Value (computed as provided in
	Section 1.7(c)) of a share of Pulte Common Stock is equal
	to or greater than $33.00 but less than $39.00, the Merger
	Consideration will be one share of Pulte Common Stock for each
	share of Company Common Stock.

	(ii)  If the Market Value of a share of Pulte Common Stock
	is equal to or greater than $39.00 but less than $45.04, the
	Merger Consideration for each share of Company Common Stock will

	divided by the Market Value of a share of Pulte Common Stock.

	(iii)  If the Market Value of a share of Pulte Common Stock
	is equal to or greater than $45.04, the Merger Consideration

	Merger Consideration for each share of Company Common Stock will
	be the number of shares of Pulte Common Stock equal to $33.00
	divided by the Market Value of a share of Pulte Common Stock.

	(v)  If the Market Value of a share of Pulte Common Stock
	is less than $30.00, the Merger Consideration will be 1.1 shares
	of Pulte Common Stock for each share of Company Common Stock.
	Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Market Value of a share of
	Pulte Common Stock is less than $27.00, the Company will have
	the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to
	Section 6.1(j).

(c)  The Market Value of a share of Pulte
Common Stock will be the average of the Last Sale Price of a
share of Pulte Common Stock on the New York Stock Exchange, Inc.
(NYSE) for the fifteen trading days ending on and
including the third NYSE trading day prior to the day of the
meeting at which the stockholders of the Company vote upon the
Merger. The Last Sale Price of a share of Pulte
Common Stock on a day will be the last sale price of a share of
Pulte Common Stock reported on the NYSE consolidated tape prior
to 4:00 p.m. on that day.

(d)  As a result of the Merger and without any action on
the part of the holders thereof, at the Effective Time, all
shares of Company Common Stock shall cease to be outstanding and
shall be canceled and retired and shall cease to exist, and each
holder of a certificate which immediately prior to the Effective
Time represented any such shares of Company Common Stock (a
Certificate) shall thereafter cease to have any
rights with respect to such shares of Company Common Stock,
except as provided herein or by law.

(e)  Each share of Company Common Stock held in the
treasury of the Company, by Pulte or by any direct or indirect
wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company or Pulte immediately
before the Effective Time will, at the Effective Time, be
canceled and cease to exist and no payment will be made with
respect to any of those shares.

(f)  No fractional shares of Pulte Common Stock will be
issued as a result of the Merger. Any holder of Company Common
Stock who, but for this Section 1.7(f), would be entitled
to receive a fraction of a share of Pulte Common Stock as a
result of the Merger will receive, instead of that fraction of a
share, cash equal to the result of (i) the Last Sale Price
on the Merger Date (as defined in Section 2.1) times
(ii) the fraction.

1.8  Stock of Acquisition. At the Effective Time, each
share of stock of Acquisition (Acquisition Stock)
which is outstanding immediately before the Effective Time will
be converted into one validly issued, fully paid and
nonassessable share of common stock of the Surviving
Corporation. At the Effective Time, a certificate which
represented Acquisition Stock will automatically become and be a
certificate representing the number of shares of the Surviving
Corporation common stock into which the Acquisition Stock
represented by the certificate was converted.

1.9  Adjustments. If between the date of this Agreement and
the Effective Time, the outstanding shares of Company Common
Stock or Pulte Common Stock are changed into a different number
of shares by reason of a reclassification, recapitalization,
split up, combination or exchange of shares, or any dividend
payable in stock or other securities is declared with regard to
the Company Common Stock or Pulte Common Stock with a record
date between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time,
the Merger Consideration will be adjusted to provide the holders
of Company Common Stock the same economic effect as that
contemplated by this Agreement if the reclassification,
recapitalization, split-up, combination, exchange or dividend
had not taken place.

1.10  Distributions with Regard to Company Common Stock.

(a)  Prior to the Effective Time, Acquisition and the
Company will jointly designate a bank or trust company to act as
Distributing Agent in connection with the Merger (the
Distributing Agent). Immediately before the
Effective Time, Pulte will provide the Distributing Agent with
the shares of Pulte Common Stock which will have to be
distributed to holders of Company Common Stock under
Section 1.7(a) and the cash required to make the payments
for fractional shares pursuant to Section 1.7(f).

(b)  Until they are distributed, the shares of Pulte Common
Stock held by the Distributing Agent will be deemed to be
outstanding but the Distributing Agent will not vote those
shares or exercise any rights of a shareholder with regard to
them. If any dividends are paid with regard to shares of Pulte
Common Stock while they are held by the Distributing Agent, the
Distributing Agent will hold the dividends, uninvested, until
shares of Pulte Common Stock are distributed to particular
former holders of Company Common Stock, at which time the
dividends which have been paid with regard to the shares of
Pulte Common Stock which are being distributed will be paid,
without interest, to the persons to whom the shares are being
distributed.

(c)  Promptly after the Effective Time, the Surviving
Corporation will cause the Distributing Agent to mail to each
person who was a record holder of Company Common Stock at the
Effective Time, a form of letter of transmittal for use in
effecting the surrender of Certificates in order to receive
payment of the Merger Consideration. When the Distributing Agent
receives a Certificate, together with a properly completed and
executed letter of transmittal and any other required documents,
the Distributing Agent will distribute to the holder of the
Certificate, or as otherwise directed in the letter of
transmittal, the Merger Consideration with regard to the shares
represented by the Certificate, and the Certificate will be
canceled. No interest will be paid or accrued on the Merger
Consideration upon the surrender of Certificates. If payment is
to be made to a person other than the person in whose name a
surrendered Certificate is registered, the surrendered
Certificate must be properly endorsed or otherwise be in proper
form for transfer, and the person who surrenders the Certificate
must provide funds for payment of any transfer or other taxes
required by reason of the distribution to a person other than
the registered holder of the surrendered Certificate or
establish to the satisfaction of the Surviving Corporation that
the tax has been paid. After the Effective Time, a Certificate
which has not been surrendered will represent only the right to
receive the Merger Consideration (and any dividends paid after
the Effective Time with regard to shares of Pulte Common Stock
included in the Merger Consideration), without any interest.

(d)  If a Certificate has been lost, stolen or destroyed,
the Surviving Corporation will accept an affidavit and
indemnification reasonably satisfactory to it instead of the
Certificate and will pay the Merger Consideration to the holder
of the shares of Company Common Stock which had been represented
by the Certificate.

(e)  At any time which is more than six months after the
Effective Time, Pulte may require the Distributing Agent to
deliver to it any shares of Pulte Common Stock which had been
made available to the Distributing Agent and have not been
disbursed to former holders of Company Common Stock and any
dividends received by the Distributing Agent in respect of such
undisbursed Pulte Common Stock which are then held by the
Distributing Agent, and after the Pulte Common Stock and
dividends have been delivered to Pulte, former stockholders of
the Company must look to Pulte for payment of the Merger
Consideration upon surrender of the Certificates held by them.
None of Pulte, the Surviving Corporation or the Distributing
Agent will be liable to any former stockholder of the Company
for any Merger Consideration which is delivered to a public
official pursuant to any abandoned property, escheat or similar
law.

(f)  After the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation
will not record any transfers of shares of Company Common Stock
on the stock transfer books of the Company or the Surviving
Corporation, and the stock ledger of the Company will be closed.
If, after the Effective Time, Certificates are presented for
transfer, they will be canceled and treated as having been
surrendered for the Merger Consideration described in
Section 1.7(b).

1.11  Determinations Regarding Documents. The Company (or,
after the Merger, the Surviving Corporation) will have the
discretion, which it may delegate in whole or in part, to
determine whether letters of transmittal accompanying
Certificates have been properly and timely completed, signed and
submitted and to determine whether or not to disregard
immaterial defects in particular letters of transmittal. The
decision of the Company (or, after the Merger, the Surviving
Corporation) with regard to those matters will be conclusive and
binding. None of Pulte, the Company, the Surviving Corporation
or the Distributing Agent will have any obligation to notify any
person of any defect in a letter of transmittal submitted to the
Company, the Surviving Corporation or Pulte, as applicable. The
Distributing Agent or another person or entity agreed to by the

Company and Pulte will make all computations contemplated by
Section 1.7 and those computations will be conclusive and
binding on the holders of Company Common Stock.

1.12  Company Stock Options.

(a)  At the Effective Time, each Company Stock Option (as
defined in Section 3.1(f)) which is outstanding at the
Effective Time will accelerate and vest and at the election of
the holder thereof (i) will become the right to receive a
sum in cash equal to (A) the amount, if any, by which the
per share exercise price of the option is less than the Market
Value of the Merger Consideration for a share of Company Common
Stock, times (B) the number of shares of Company Common
Stock issuable upon exercise of the option in full (irrespective
of vesting provisions) or, (ii) if the holder does not so
elect, will be converted into an option to acquire, on the same
terms and conditions as were applicable under the Company Stock
Option Plan (as defined in Section 3.1(f)) pursuant to
which such Company Stock Option was granted (but taking into
account any changes thereto, including the acceleration thereof,
provided for in such Company Stock Option Plan or in such option
by reason of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated
hereby), that number of shares of Pulte Common Stock determined
by multiplying the number of shares of Company Common Stock
subject to such Company Stock Option by the Exchange Ratio,
rounded, if necessary, to the nearest whole share of Pulte
Common Stock, at a price per share (rounded to the nearest
one-hundredth of a cent) equal to the per share exercise price
specified in such Company Stock Option divided by the Exchange
Ratio; 
provided, however,
 that in the case of any Company
Stock Option to which Section 421 of the Code applies by
reason of its qualification under Section 422 of the Code,
the option price, the number of shares subject to such option
and the terms and conditions of exercise of such option shall be
determined in a manner consistent with the requirements of
Section 424(a) of the Code. If such holder has elected to
receive cash, in order to receive the amount to which the holder
is entitled under this Section, the holder must deliver to the
Surviving Corporation prior to the date of the Companys
Merger Stockholders Meeting (as defined in Section 4.4)
(i) any certificate or option agreement relating to the
option and (ii) a document in which the holder acknowledges
that the payment the holder is receiving is in full satisfaction
of any rights the holder may have under or with regard to the
option. Pulte will pay the cash amount due under this
Section 1.12(a) to a holder of a Company Stock Option
promptly after the Merger and after the Surviving Corporation
receives from the holder the items described in clauses
(i) and (ii) of the preceding sentence. At the
Effective Time, the restricted stock of the Company will
accelerate and vest in accordance with its terms.

(b)  As soon as practicable after the Effective Time, Pulte
shall deliver to the holders of Company Stock Options
appropriate notices setting forth such holders rights
pursuant to the Company Stock Option Plans (including that, in
connection with the Merger and pursuant to the terms of the
Company Stock Option Plans, the Company Stock Options have
become fully vested and exercisable) and, unless the holder has
elected to receive cash, the agreements evidencing the grants of
such Company Stock Options shall continue in effect on the same
terms and conditions (subject to the adjustments required by
this Section 1.12 after giving effect to the Merger and the
terms of the applicable Company Stock Option Plan). To the
extent permitted by law, Pulte shall comply with the terms of
the Company Stock Option Plans and shall take such reasonable
steps as are necessary or required by, and subject to the
provisions of, such Company Stock Option Plans, to have the
Company Stock Options which qualified as incentive stock options
prior to the Effective Time continue to qualify as incentive
stock options of Pulte after the Effective Time.

(c)  Pulte shall take all corporate action necessary to
reserve for issuance a sufficient number of shares of Pulte
Common Stock for delivery upon exercise of the Company Stock
Options in accordance with this Section 1.12. Promptly
after the Effective Time, Pulte shall file a registration
statement on Form S-3 or Form S-8, as the case may be
(or any successor or other appropriate forms), with respect to
the shares of Pulte Common Stock subject to such options and
shall use commercially reasonable efforts to maintain the
effectiveness of such registration statement or registration
statements (and maintain the current status of the prospectus or
prospectuses contained therein) for so long as such options
remain outstanding. With respect to those individuals who
subsequent to the Merger will be subject to the reporting
requirements under Section 16(a) of the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act), where
applicable, Pulte shall administer the Company Stock Option
Plans in a manner consistent with the exemptions provided by
Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act.

1.13  Affiliates. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
herein, to the fullest extent permitted by law, no certificates
representing shares of Pulte Common Stock or cash shall be
delivered to a Person who may deemed an affiliate of
the Company in accordance with Section 4.9 hereof for
purposes of Rule 145 under the Securities Act of 1933, as
amended (the Securities Act), until such Person has
executed and delivered an Affiliate Agreement (as defined in
Section 4.9) to Pulte.

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES

3.1  Representations and Warranties of the Company. Except
as set forth in the Company Disclosure Schedule delivered by the
Company to Pulte prior to the execution of this Agreement (the
Company Disclosure Schedule) (each section of which
qualifies and is a correspondingly numbered representation and
warranty or covenant to the extent specified therein), the
Company represents and warrants to Pulte and Acquisition as
follows:

	(a)  Except as set forth on Section 3.1-A of the
	Company Disclosure Schedule, the Company and each of its
	subsidiaries (each corporation or other entity of which a
	company owns directly or indirectly 51% or more of the equity
	being a subsidiary of that company), is an entity
	duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the
	laws of its jurisdiction of incorporation or organization, has
	the requisite power and authority to own, lease and operate its
	properties and to carry on its business as now being conducted,
	except where the failures to be so organized, existing and in
	good standing or to have such power and authority, in the
	aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to have a Material
	Adverse Effect (as defined below) on the Company, and is duly
	qualified and in good standing to do business in each
	jurisdiction in which the nature of its business or the
	ownership or leasing of its properties makes such qualification
	necessary other than in such jurisdictions where the failures so
	to qualify or to be in good standing, in the aggregate, would
	not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on
	the Company. The copies of the Certificate of Incorporation and
	By-laws of the Company which were previously furnished or made
	available to Pulte are true, complete and correct copies of such
	documents as in effect on the date of this Agreement. As used in
	this Agreement, the term Material Adverse Effect on
	a company means a material adverse effect on (i) the
	business, operations, results of operations, properties, assets,
	liabilities or condition (financial or otherwise) of that
	company and its subsidiaries taken as a whole or (ii) the
	ability of that company to consummate the Merger or the other

	principles (GAAP), (C) a change or occurrence
	affecting the homebuilding industry generally, or (D) a
	change in general economic conditions (including, without
	limitation, a change in interest rates).

	(b)  The Company has all corporate power and authority
	necessary to enable it to enter into this Agreement and carry
	out the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. All
	corporate actions necessary to authorize the Company to enter
	into this Agreement and carry out the transactions contemplated
	by it, other than approval of the Merger and adoption of this
	Agreement by the stockholders of the Company, have been taken.
	This Agreement has been duly executed by the Company and is a
	valid and binding agreement of the Company, enforceable against
	the Company in accordance with its terms.

	(c)  Except as set forth on Section 3.1-C of the
	Company Disclosure Schedule, neither the execution and delivery
	of this Agreement or of any document to be delivered in
	accordance with this Agreement nor the consummation of the
	transactions contemplated by this Agreement or by any document
	to be delivered in accordance with this Agreement will violate,
	result in a breach of, or constitute a default (or an event
	which, with notice or lapse of time or both, would constitute a
	default) under, (i) the Certificate of Incorporation or
	By-laws of the Company, or (ii) any law, order, rule or
	regulation of any Governmental Entity (as defined below) having
	jurisdiction over the Company or any of its subsidiaries,
	except, in the case of (ii), for violations, breaches, or
	defaults which, in the aggregate, would not reasonably be
	expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company. As
	used in this Agreement, the term Governmental Entity
	means a court or governmental or quasi-governmental,
	legislative, administrative or regulatory body, authority or
	agency, whether federal, state or local, or domestic or foreign.

	(d)  Except as shown on Section 3.1-D of the Company
	Disclosure Schedule or except as expressly contemplated herein,
	no governmental filings, authorizations, approvals, or consents,
	or other governmental action, other than the expiration or
	termination of waiting periods under the Hart-Scott Rodino
	Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended (the
	HSR Act), if any, are required to permit the
	Company to fulfill all its obligations under this Agreement,
	other than governmental filings, authorizations, approvals,
	consents or other governmental actions the absence of which, in
	the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to have a
	Material Adverse Effect on the Company.

	(e)  The Board of Directors of the Company, by resolutions
	duly adopted by the requisite vote of those voting at a meeting
	duly called and held and not subsequently rescinded or modified
	in any way (the Company Board Approval),

	to and in the best interests of the Company and its
	stockholders, (ii) approved this Agreement, the Merger and
	the Voting Agreement, (iii) recommended that the

	approval of this Agreement and the Merger for purposes of
	Section 203 of the DGCL. To the knowledge of the Company,
	except for Section 203 of the DGCL (which has been rendered
	inapplicable), no state takeover statute is applicable to this
	Agreement, the Merger or the other transactions contemplated
	hereby. The affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the
	outstanding shares of Company Common Stock to adopt this
	Agreement and approve the Merger (the Required Company
	Vote) is the only vote of the holders of any class or
	series of the Company capital stock necessary to adopt this
	Agreement and approve the Merger and the other transactions
	contemplated hereby. The holders of Company Common Stock do not
	have dissenters rights under the DGCL.

	(f)  As of April 20, 2001, the authorized capital
	stock of the Company consisted of (A) 30,000,000 shares of
	Company Common Stock, of which 18,707,472 shares were
	outstanding and no shares were held in the treasury of the
	Company, and (B) 10,000,000 shares of Preferred Stock, par
	value $0.001 per share, none of which were outstanding. Since
	April 20, 2001 to the date of this Agreement, there have

	been no issuances of shares of the capital stock of the Company
	or any other securities of the Company other than issuances of
	shares pursuant to options or rights outstanding as of
	April 20, 2001 under the Company Benefit Plans (as defined
	in Section 3.1(y)). All issued and outstanding shares of
	the capital stock of the Company are duly authorized, validly
	issued, fully paid and nonassessable and free of any preemptive
	rights. There were outstanding as of April 20, 2001 no
	options, shares of restricted stock, warrants or other rights to
	acquire capital stock from the Company other than options,
	shares of restricted stock, and other rights to acquire capital
	stock of the Company representing in the aggregate the right to
	purchase 2,238,733 shares of Company Common Stock (collectively,
	the Company Stock Options) under the Companys
	1981 Stock Option Plan, 1986 Stock Option and Stock Appreciation
	Rights (SAR) Plan, 1991, 1993, 1995, 1998 and 2000 Executive
	Long-Term Incentive Plans, 1991 Directors Stock Plan, 1995
	Director Stock Plan and 1998 Director Stock Plan, and any
	amendments thereto (collectively, the Company Stock Option
	Plans). Section 3.1-F of the Company Disclosure
	Schedule sets forth a complete and correct list, as of
	April 20, 2001, of the number of shares of Company Common
	Stock subject to the Company Stock Options and the dates of
	grant and the exercise prices of the Company Stock Options. No
	options or warrants or other rights to acquire capital stock
	from the Company have been issued or granted since
	April 20, 2001 to the date of this Agreement.

	(g)  No bonds, debentures, notes or other indebtedness of
	the Company having the right to vote on any matters on which
	stockholders may vote are issued or outstanding.

	are no registration covenants or transfer or voting restrictions
	with respect to outstanding securities of any of the
	Companys subsidiaries.

	(i)  Since January 1, 1998, the Company has filed with
	the Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC) all
	forms, statements, reports and documents it has been required to
	file under the Securities Act, the Exchange Act, or the rules
	under either of such acts (the Company SEC Reports).

	similar services for such property), as are needed to allow
	development in the manner anticipated by the Company or any of
	its subsidiaries as of the date hereof, except for failures to
	conform to applicable governmental standards and those
	impediments to approvals, if any, listed in Schedule 3.1-U
	of the Company Disclosure Schedule, and such failures to meet
	required standards and impediments to approvals as, in the

	delivered in accordance with this Agreement will constitute a
	default (or an event which with notice, the lapse of time or
	both would become a default) under or give rise to a right of
	termination, cancellation or acceleration of any right or
	obligation of the Company or any of its subsidiaries or to a
	loss of any benefit to which the Company or any of its
	subsidiaries is entitled under any provision of any agreement,
	contract or other instrument binding upon the Company or any of
	its subsidiaries or any assets of the Company or any of its
	subsidiaries, or result in the imposition of any Lien on any
	asset of the Company or any of its subsidiaries, except for such

3.2  Representations and Warranties of Pulte and
Acquisition. Except as set forth in Pulte Disclosure Schedule
delivered by Pulte to the Company prior to the execution of this
Agreement (the Pulte Disclosure Schedule) (each
section of which qualifies and is a correspondingly numbered
representation and warranty or covenant to the extent specified
therein), each of Pulte and Acquisition represents and warrants
to the Company as follows:

	(a)  Pulte and each of its subsidiaries, including
	Acquisition, is an entity duly organized, validly existing and
	in good standing under the laws of its jurisdiction of
	incorporation or organization, has the requisite power and
	authority to own, lease and operate its properties and to carry
	on its business as now being conducted, except where the
	failures to be so organized, existing and in good standing or to
	have such power and authority, in the aggregate, would not
	reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on
	Pulte, and is duly qualified and in good standing to do business
	in each jurisdiction in which the nature of its business or the
	ownership or leasing of its properties makes such qualification
	necessary other than in such jurisdictions where the failures so
	to qualify or to be in good standing, in the aggregate, would
	not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on
	Pulte. The copies of the Articles of Incorporation and By-laws
	of Pulte which were previously furnished or made available to
	the Company are true, complete and correct copies of such
	documents as in effect on the date of this Agreement.
	Acquisition is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Pulte and has
	engaged in no activities other than in connection with the
	transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

	(b)  Each of Pulte and Acquisition has all corporate power
	and authority necessary to enable it to enter into this
	Agreement and carry out the transactions contemplated by this
	Agreement. All corporate actions necessary to authorize each of
	Pulte and Acquisition to enter into this Agreement and carry out

	the transactions contemplated by it, other than the approval of
	(i) the issuance of shares of Pulte Common Stock in the
	Merger and (ii) the adoption of a stock option plan (or the
	amendment of a Pulte Stock Option Plan) to allow for the
	conversion of the Company Stock Options pursuant to
	Section 1.12 (collectively, the Pulte Meeting
	Matters) by the stockholders of Pulte, have been taken,
	including all actions required to satisfy the conditions
	contained in Section 5.1(k). This Agreement has been duly
	executed by each of Pulte and Acquisition and is a valid and
	binding agreement of each of Pulte and Acquisition, enforceable
	against each of Pulte and Acquisition in accordance with its
	terms.

	(c)  Neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement
	or of any document to be delivered in accordance with this
	Agreement nor the consummation of the transactions contemplated
	by this Agreement or by any document to be delivered in
	accordance with this Agreement will violate, result in a breach
	of, or constitute a default (or an event which, with notice or
	lapse of time or both, would constitute a default) under,
	(i) the Articles of Incorporation of Pulte or the
	Certificate of Incorporation of Acquisition or the By-laws of
	either Pulte or Acquisition, or (ii) any law, order, rule
	or regulation of any Governmental Entity having jurisdiction
	over Pulte or any of its subsidiaries, including Acquisition,
	except in the case of (ii), for violations, breaches, or
	defaults which, in the aggregate, would not reasonably be
	expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on Pulte.

	(d)  Except as shown on Section 3.2-D of the Pulte
	Disclosure Schedule or except as expressly contemplated herein,
	no governmental filings, authorizations, approvals, or consents,
	or other governmental action, other than the expiration or
	termination of waiting periods under the HSR Act, if any, are
	required to permit each of Pulte and Acquisition to fulfill all
	its obligations under this Agreement, other than governmental
	filings, authorizations, approvals, consents or other
	governmental actions the absence of which, in the aggregate,
	would reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect
	on Pulte.

	(e)  The Board of Directors of Pulte, by resolutions duly
	adopted by the requisite vote of those voting at a meeting duly
	called and held and not subsequently rescinded or modified in

	Matters are fair to and in the best interests of Pulte and its
	shareholders, (ii) approved this Agreement and the Pulte
	Meeting Matters, (iii) recommended that the shareholders of
	Pulte approve the Pulte Meeting Matters, (iv) directed that

	Pultes shareholders at Pultes Merger Stockholders
	Meeting and (v) determined that the Company is not an
	Interested Shareholder for the purposes of
	Article X of Pultes Articles of Incorporation. The
	Pulte Board Approval constitutes approval of this Agreement and
	the Merger for purposes of Chapters 7A of the Michigan
	Business Corporation Act (MBCA). To the knowledge of
	Pulte, except for Chapters 7A and 7B of the MBCA (which
	have been rendered inapplicable), no state takeover statute is
	applicable to this Agreement, the Merger or the other
	transactions contemplated hereby. The affirmative vote of the
	holders of a majority of the shares of Pulte Common Stock
	present at Pultes Merger Stockholders Meeting and entitled
	to vote on the Pulte Meeting Matters (the Required Pulte
	Vote) is the only vote of the holders of any class or
	series of Pulte capital stock necessary to approve the Pulte
	Meeting Matters. The holders of Pulte Common Stock do not have
	dissenters rights under the MBCA. Pulte is not governed by
	Section 7A or 7B of the MBCA.

	per share, none of which were outstanding. Since April 20,
	2001 to the date of this Agreement, there have been no issuances
	of shares of the capital stock of Pulte or any other securities
	of Pulte other than issuances of shares pursuant to options or
	rights outstanding as of April 20, 2001 under the Pulte
	Benefit Plans (as defined in Section 3.2(x)). All issued
	and outstanding shares of the capital stock of Pulte are, and
	when shares of Pulte Common Stock are issued in the Merger or
	upon exercise of the Company Stock Options converted into
	options to acquire Pulte Common Stock pursuant to
	Section 1.12, such shares will be, duly authorized, validly
	issued, fully paid and nonassessable and free of any preemptive
	rights. There were outstanding as of April 20, 2001 no
	options, warrants or other rights to acquire capital stock from
	Pulte other than options and other rights to acquire capital
	stock from Pulte representing in the aggregate the right to
	purchase 5,225,182 shares of Pulte Common Stock

	affect, any real

	(including, without limitation, as a result of a lack of access
	to such property or an unavailability of utilities or similar
	services for such property), as are needed to allow development
	in the manner anticipated by Pulte or any of its subsidiaries as

	Agreement or of any document to be delivered in accordance with
	this Agreement nor the consummation of the transactions
	contemplated by this Agreement or by any document to be
	delivered in accordance with this Agreement will constitute a
	default (or an event which with notice, the lapse of time or

	termination, cancellation or acceleration of any right or
	obligation of Pulte or any of its subsidiaries or to a loss of
	any benefit to which Pulte or any of its subsidiaries is
	entitled under any provision of any agreement, contract or other

	subsidiaries, except for such defaults, rights of termination,
	cancellation or acceleration, losses or Liens that, in the
	aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to have a Material

	Benefit Plans). Except as shown on Section 3.2-X(i)
	of the Pulte Disclosure Schedule (or as otherwise permitted by
	this Agreement): (a) neither Pulte nor any ERISA Affiliate
	has any formal plan or commitment, whether legally binding or

	employee or terminated employee of Pulte or any ERISA Affiliate;
	and (b) since December 31, 2000, there have been no

	Pulte.

	(ii)  With respect to each Pulte Benefit Plan, except shown
	on Section 3.2-X(ii) of the Pulte Disclosure Schedule or
	as, in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to have a
	Material Adverse Effect on Pulte: (a) if intended to
	qualify under Section 401(a), 401(k) or 403(a) of the Code,
	such plan so qualifies, and its trust is exempt from taxation
	under Section 501(a) of the Code; (b) such plan has
	been administered in accordance with its terms and applicable
	law; (c) no breaches of fiduciary duty have occurred;
	(d) no non-exempt prohibited transaction within the meaning
	of Section 406 of ERISA has occurred; (e) as of the
	date of this Agreement, no Lien imposed under the Code or ERISA
	exists; and (f) all contributions and premiums due
	(including any extensions for such contributions and premiums)
	have been made in full or have been properly accrued on
	Pultes financial statements.

	(iii)  None of the Pulte Benefit Plans has incurred any
	accumulated funding deficiency, as such term is
	defined in Section 412 of the Code, whether or not waived.

	(iv)  Except as shown on Section 3.2-X(iv) of the
	Pulte Disclosure Schedule, neither Pulte nor any ERISA Affiliate
	has incurred any liabilities under Title IV of ERISA
	(including Sections 4063-4064 and 4069 of ERISA) that have
	not been satisfied in full except as, in the aggregate, would
	not have or would not reasonably be expected to have a Material
	Adverse Effect on Pulte or that have not been reflected on
	Pultes consolidated financial statements.

	(v)  With respect to each Pulte Benefit Plan that is a
	welfare plan (as defined in Section 3(1) of
	ERISA), except as shown on Section 3.2-X(v) of the Pulte
	Disclosure Schedule, no such plan provides medical or death
	benefits with respect to current or former employees of Pulte or
	any of its subsidiaries beyond their termination of employment,
	other than (i) as may be required under Part 6 of
	Title I or ERISA, (ii) at the expense of the
	participant or the participants beneficiary, or
	(iii) as, in the aggregate, would not reasonably be
	expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on Pulte.

	(vi)  Except with respect to payments under the agreements
	and programs shown on Section 3.2-X(vi) of the Pulte
	Disclosure Schedule, the consummation of the transactions
	contemplated by this Agreement will not entitle any individual
	to severance pay or any tax gross-up payments with
	respect to the imposition of any tax pursuant to
	Section 4999 of the Code or

	accelerate the time of payment or vesting, or increase the
	amount, of compensation or benefits due to any individual with
	respect to any Pulte Benefit Plan.

	(vii)  Except as shown on Section 3.2-X(vii) of the
	Pulte Disclosure Schedule, there is no Pulte Benefit Plan that
	is a multiemployer plan, as such term is defined in
	Section 3(37) of ERISA, or which is covered by
	Section 4063 or 4064 of ERISA.

	(viii)  Pulte has furnished or made available to the
	Company, within a reasonable period prior to the Effective Time,
	complete and accurate (in all material respects) documentation
	with respect to all Pulte Benefit Plans, including, but not
	limited to, plan documents, summary plan descriptions and other
	material employee communications, benefit computations and
	methodologies, benefit costs, participant lists, government
	filings, and funding status.

	(y)  Pulte acknowledges that each of the executives of the
	Company listed on Section 3.2-Y of the Company Disclosure
	Schedule will be entitled to, and shall receive, upon
	consummation of the Merger payment of the amounts provided for
	in each executives respective employment or severance
	agreement following a change of control and termination without
	cause, as such terms are defined in such agreement. The
	foregoing acknowledgment does not in any way create any
	inference that any of the Companys employees that are not
	listed on Section 3.2-Y of the Company Disclosure Schedule
	do or do not have similar rights.

	(z)  To the knowledge of Pulte, none of Pulte, any of its
	subsidiaries or any directors, officers, agents or employees of
	Pulte or any of its subsidiaries has (i) used any funds for
	unlawful contributions, gifts, entertainment or other unlawful
	expenses related to political activity, (ii) made any
	unlawful payments to foreign or domestic government officials or
	employees or to foreign or domestic political parties or
	campaigns or violated any provisions of the Foreign Corrupt
	Practices Act of 1977, as amended, or (iii) made any other
	unlawful payments, which, in the case of (i), (ii), or
	(iii), in the aggregate, would reasonably be expected to have a
	Material Adverse Effect on Pulte.

information to the Federal Trade Commission and the Department

4.4 Stockholders Meetings.  Each of Pulte and the
Company will take all action which is necessary in accordance

Certificate of Incorporation (the Company) and By-Laws to call
and convene a special meeting of its stockholders (each, a
Merger Stockholders Meeting) as soon as practicable
to consider and vote, in the case of the Company, upon adoption
of this Agreement and approval of the Merger and, in the case of
Pulte, approval of the Pulte Meeting Matters. The proxy
statement distributed by each of Pulte and the Company with
respect to its Merger Stockholders Meeting will include the
recommendation of its Board of Directors that its stockholders
vote to adopt, in the case of the Company, this Agreement and
approve the Merger, and, in the case of Pulte, the Pulte Meeting
Matters, unless the Board of Directors of Pulte or the Company
has determined, after consultation with its counsel, that such
Board of Directors is required by its fiduciary duties to state
that it no longer recommends that the stockholders of Pulte or
the Company, as the case may be, vote in favor of adoption of
the Pulte Meeting Matters or this Agreement and the Merger. Each
of Pulte and the Company will use all commercially reasonable
efforts to solicit from its stockholders proxies or votes in
favor of adoption of, in the case of the Company, this Agreement
and approval of the Merger, and, in the case of Pulte, the Pulte
Meeting Matters.

4.5 Registration Statement and Proxy Statement.

(a)  Pulte will prepare and file with SEC as soon as
practicable after the date of this Agreement a Registration
Statement on Form S-4 relating to the shares of Pulte
Common Stock to be issued as a result of the merger (the
Registration Statement). The Registration Statement
will include a joint proxy statement (the Joint Proxy
Statement/ Prospectus) of Pulte and the Company relating
to the Merger Stockholders Meetings. Pulte and the Company will
cooperate to provide all information which is required to be
included in the Registration Statement or in the Joint Proxy
Statement/ Prospectus in a timely manner so the Registration
Statement can be filed with the SEC as soon as reasonably
practicable. Pulte will cause the Registration Statement, and
Pulte and the Company will cause the Joint Proxy Statement/
Prospectus, to comply as to form in all material respects with
the applicable provisions of the Securities Act and the Exchange
Act and the rules under them. Pulte will use its best efforts,
and the Company will cooperate with Pulte, to cause the
Registration Statement to be declared effective by the staff of
the SEC as promptly as practicable after it is filed (including
without limitation, responding to any comments received from the
SEC with respect to the Registration Statement) and to keep the
Registration Statement effective as long as is necessary to
consummate the Merger. Each of Pulte and the Company will, as
promptly as practicable, provide to the other copies of any
written comments received from the SEC with regard to the
Registration Statement or the Joint Proxy Statement/ Prospectus
and will advise the other of any comments with respect to the
Registration Statement or the Joint Proxy Statement/ Prospectus
which are received orally from the staff of the SEC. Pulte will
use its best efforts to obtain, prior to the effective date of
Registration Statement, any qualifications, permits or approvals
which are necessary under any state securities laws in order to
carry out the Merger, and Pulte will pay all expenses incident
to obtaining those qualifications, permits or approvals. Pulte
will provide the Company with a reasonable opportunity to review
and comment on any amendment or supplement to the

Form S-4 prior to filing such with the SEC, and will
provide the Company with a copy of all such filings made with
the SEC. Notwithstanding any other provision herein to the
contrary, no amendment or supplement (including by incorporation
by reference) to the Joint Proxy Statement/ Prospectus or the
Registration Statement shall be made without the approval of
both parties, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld
or delayed; 
provided, however,
 that with respect to
documents filed by a party which are incorporated by reference
in the Form S-4 or Joint Proxy Statement/ Prospectus, this
right of approval shall apply only with respect to information
relating to the other party or its business, financial condition
or results of operations.

(b)  Pulte and Acquisition each represents and warrants to
the Company, and the Company represents and warrants to Pulte,
that none of the information supplied by it for inclusion, or
included in a document filed by it which is incorporated by
reference, in the Registration Statement or the Joint Proxy
Statement/ Prospectus will (i) in the case of the
Registration Statement and each amendment, at the time the
Registration Statement is filed or becomes effective and at the
Effective Time, and (ii) in the case of the Joint Proxy
Statement/ Prospectus and each amendment or supplement to it, at
the time it is mailed to stockholders and at the time of the
Merger Stockholders Meetings, contain an untrue statement of a
material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be
stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in
light of the circumstances under which they were made, not
misleading. If at any time before the Effective Time an event
occurs with respect to the Company or any of its subsidiaries,
or with respect to Pulte or any of its subsidiaries, as the case
may be, which is required to be described in the Registration
Statement or in the Joint Proxy Statement/ Prospectus, an
amendment or supplement to the Registration Statement or the
Joint Proxy Statement/ Prospectus will be filed with the SEC as
promptly as practicable and, to the extent required by law, will
be distributed to the stockholders of Pulte, the Company or both
of them. Neither Pulte nor the Company will make any amendment
or supplement to the Registration Statement or the Joint Proxy
Statement/ Prospectus without the approval of the other, which
approval will not be unreasonably withheld (and will under no
circumstances be withheld to the extent the amendment or
supplement is required to cause the Registration Statement or
the Joint Proxy Statement/ Prospectus to comply with applicable
law). Pulte will advise the Company promptly after it receives
notice that the Registration Statement has become effective or
that any supplement or amendment to it has been filed, that any
stop order relating to the Registration Statement has been
issued, or that the qualification or registration of the Pulte
Common Stock issuable in connection with the Merger under any
state securities law has been suspended, of any request by the
staff of the SEC for an amendment of the Registration Statement
or the Joint Proxy Statement/ Prospectus, or of the receipt of
comments or requests for additional information from the staff
of the SEC or the response to any such comments or requests for
additional information.

(c)  The Company and Pulte each will cause its Merger
Stockholders Meetings to be held not later than 45 days
after the day on which the Registration Statement becomes
effective.

(d)  The Companys Board of Directors will not take
any action, other than causing the Company to terminate this
Agreement if it is entitled to do so under Article VI,
which prevents the Companys stockholders from voting upon
the Merger, and Pultes Board of Directors will not take
any action, other than causing Pulte to terminate this Agreement
if it is entitled to do so under Article VI, which prevents
Pultes stockholders from voting upon the Pulte Meeting
Matters.

4.6  No Solicitation of Offers; Notice of Proposals from
Others.

(a)  Neither the Company nor any of its subsidiaries will,
and the Company will use its best efforts to cause its and its
subsidiaries respective directors, officers, employees,
investment bankers, attorneys and other agents and
representatives not to, directly or indirectly (i) solicit,
initiate or knowingly facilitate or encourage (including by way
of furnishing or disclosing information) any inquiry or the
making of any offer or proposal by any corporation, partnership,
trust, person or other entity or group (a Third
Party) with respect to, or that could reasonably be
expected to lead to, any merger, consolidation, share
acquisition, asset purchase, share exchange, business
combination, tender offer, exchange offer or similar transaction
involving the acquisition of all or a substantial portion of the
assets of the Company and its subsidiaries, taken at a whole, or
a significant equity interest in (including by way of tender
offer), or a recapitalization or restructuring of, the Company
or any of its material subsidiaries (any of those transactions
being a Company Acquisition Transaction), or

(ii) negotiate, explore or otherwise communicate in any way
with any Third Party with respect to any possible Company
Acquisition Transaction, or enter into, approve or recommend any
agreement, arrangement or understanding requiring it to abandon,
terminate or otherwise fail to consummate the Merger or any
other of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement;
provided however, that the Company may, in response to a
proposal which was not solicited after the date of this
Agreement, furnish information to, and engage in discussions or
negotiations with, a Third Party, if, but only if, (A) the
Companys Board of Directors determines, in good faith
after consultation with its financial advisor, that the Third
Party is financially capable of completing the transaction which
is the subject of the proposal and that, if completed, that
transaction would result in greater value to the Companys
stockholders than the Merger and would be more favorable to the
Company and its stockholders than the Merger and (B) before
furnishing or disclosing any non-public information to, or
entering into discussions or negotiations with, the Third Party,
the Company receives from the Third Party an executed
confidentiality agreement with terms no less favorable in the
aggregate to the Company than those contained in the
Confidentiality Agreements, each dated as of January 9,
2001, between Pulte and the Company, which confidentiality
agreement does not provide for any exclusive right to negotiate
with the Company or any payments by the Company. Nothing in this
Section 4.6(a) will prohibit the Board of Directors of the
Company from complying with Rule 14e-2 and Rule 14d-9 under
the Exchange Act with regard to a tender offer or an exchange
offer or prohibit the Company from selling assets or properties
in the ordinary course of business.

(b)  The Company will (i) no later than the end of the
first business day after the Company receives an inquiry,
proposal or offer with respect to a possible Company Acquisition
Transaction or a request for non-public information relating to
the Company in connection with a possible Company Acquisition
Transaction or for access to its or any of its subsidiaries,
properties, books or records by any Third Party that informs the
Companys Board of Directors that the Third Party is
considering making, or has made, a proposal or offer with
respect to a Company Acquisition Transaction (any such inquiry
proposal, offer or request being an Acquisition
Proposal), notify Pulte in writing of the inquiry,
proposal, offer or request, (ii) in that written notice,
indicate in reasonable detail the identity of the Third Party
(including the name of the Third Party) and the terms and
conditions of the proposal or offer, (iii) promptly notify Pulte
of any determination by the Companys Board of Directors
that the Company should furnish information to, or engage in
discussions or negotiations with, any Third Party, and
(iv) keep Pulte informed of the progress of any discussions
or negotiations with any Third Party.

(c)  The Company will immediately cease and cause to be
terminated any existing activities, discussions or negotiations
with any parties (other than Pulte) which have been conducted
before the date of this Agreement with respect to any possible
Company Acquisition Transaction and will inform any such parties
of the Companys obligations under this Section 4.6.

(d)  Neither Pulte nor any of its subsidiaries will, and
Pulte will use its best efforts to cause its and its
subsidiaries respective directors, officers, employees,
investment bankers, attorneys and other agents and
representatives not to, directly or indirectly (i) solicit,
initiate or knowingly facilitate or encourage (including by way
of furnishing or disclosing information) any inquiry or the
making of any offer or proposal by any Third Party with respect
to, or that could reasonably be expected to lead to, any merger,
consolidation, share acquisition, asset purchase, share
exchange, business combination, tender offer, exchange offer or
similar transaction involving the acquisition of all or a
substantial portion of the assets of Pulte and its subsidiaries,
taken at a whole, or a significant equity interest in (including
by way of tender offer), or a recapitalization or restructuring
of, Pulte or any of its material subsidiaries, that would
impede, delay or prevent the consummation of the Merger or any
of the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement (any
such merger, consolidation or other transaction being a
Pulte Acquisition Transaction), or
(ii) negotiate, explore or otherwise communicate in any way
with any Third Party with respect to any possible Pulte
Acquisition Transaction, or enter into, approve or recommend any
agreement, arrangement or understanding requiring it to abandon,
terminate or otherwise fail to consummate the Merger or any
other of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.
Nothing in this Section 4.6(d) will prohibit the Board of
Directors of Pulte from complying with Rule 14e-2 and
Rule 14d-9 under the Exchange Act with regard to a tender
offer or an exchange offer or prohibit Pulte from selling assets
or properties in the ordinary course of business.

4.7  Pultes and Acquisitions Efforts to Fulfill
Conditions. Pulte and Acquisition each will use its commercially
reasonable efforts to cause all the conditions set forth in
Section 5.1 to be fulfilled on or before the Merger Date.

4.8  Companys Efforts to Fulfill Conditions. The
Company will use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause
all the conditions set forth in Section 5.2 to be fulfilled
on or before the Merger Date.

4.9  Affiliate Matters. Not less than 45 days prior to the
Effective Time, the Company shall deliver to Pulte a letter
identifying all persons who, in the judgment of the Company, may
be deemed at the time this Agreement is submitted for adoption
by the stockholders of the Company, affiliates of
the Company for purposes of Rule 145 under the Securities
Act, and such list shall be updated as necessary to reflect
changes from the date thereof. The Company shall use reasonable
best efforts to cause each person identified on such list to
deliver to Pulte not less than 30 days prior to the Effective
Time, a written agreement substantially in the form attached as
Exhibit 4.9 hereto (an Affiliate Agreement).

4.10  Consulting Agreement. At or prior to the Effective
Time, the consulting agreement described on Section 4.10 of
the Company Disclosure Schedule will be terminated and the

TERMINATION

6.1  Right to Terminate. This Agreement may be terminated

authorized by the Board of Directors of the terminating party,
and, except as provided below, whether before or after approval
of the matters presented in connection with the Merger by the
stockholders of the Company or Pulte (whether or not the
Companys or Pultes stockholders have approved the
Merger):

	(a) By mutual written consent of the Company and Pulte.

	(b) By the Company (provided that the Company is not then
	in material breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or
	agreement contained herein) if (i) it is determined that
	any of the representations and warranties of Pulte and
	Acquisition contained in this Agreement was not complete and

	representations and warranties which are qualified as to
	materiality or absence of Material Adverse Effect was not true
	and correct in all respects) on the date of this Agreement, or
	(ii) if Pulte or Acquisition has breached in a material

	written notice from the Company, or by the Merger Date, if
	earlier.

	(c) By Pulte (provided that Pulte is not then in material
	breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement
	contained herein) if (i) it is determined that any of the
	representations and

	warranties of the Company contained in this Agreement was not

	those representations and warranties which are qualified as to
	materiality or absence of Material Adverse Effect was not true
	and correct in all respects) on the date of this Agreement, or
	(ii) if the Company has breached in a material respect any
	covenant or agreement contained in this Agreement and has not
	cured that breach within ten business days after written notice
	from Pulte, or by the Merger Date, if earlier.

	(d) By either Pulte or the Company if, without fault of the
	terminating party, the Merger Date is later than
	September 30, 2001, which date may be extended by mutual
	consent of Pulte and the Company; provided, however, that the
	right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this
	Section 6.1(d) will not be available to any party whose
	failure to perform or observe in any material respect any of its
	obligations under this Agreement has been the cause of, or
	resulted in, the failure of the Merger Date to occur on or
	before that date.

	(e) By either Pulte or the Company if any court of
	competent jurisdiction or other governmental authority issues an
	order (other than a temporary restraining order), decree or
	ruling, or takes any other action, restraining, enjoining or
	otherwise prohibiting the Merger, and that order, decree, ruling
	or other action becomes final and nonappealable.

	(f) By either Pulte or the Company, if the stockholders of
	the Company fail to adopt this Agreement and approve the Merger
	at the Companys Merger Stockholders Meeting or the
	shareholders of Pulte fail to approve the Pulte Meeting Matters
	at Pultes Merger Stockholders Meeting.

	(i) By the Company, if the Board of Directors of the
	Company, after consultation with and based upon the advice of
	outside legal counsel and its financial advisors, shall have
	determined in good faith that approving and entering into an
	agreement in connection with a Company Bona Fide Proposal (as
	defined below), and consummating such proposal would result in a
	transaction more favorable to its stockholders from a financial
	point of view than the transactions contemplated by this
	Agreement, 
provided, however,
 that this Agreement may not
	be terminated pursuant to this Section 6.1(i) unless
	(i) the Company shall have provided Pulte with at least
	five business days advance notice of such termination and
	(ii) concurrent with the termination, the Company pays
	Pulte the fee required by Section 6.3(e). A Company
	Bona Fide Proposal shall mean a Company Acquisition
	Proposal which the Companys Board of Directors determines
	in good faith, after consultation with outside legal counsel and
	its financial advisors, is reasonably capable of being
	consummated by the person making the proposal, taking into
	account regulatory, legal, financial and other relevant matters.

	(j) By the Company, if the Market Value of a share of Pulte
	Common Stock is less than $27.00; provided that the Company has

terminate this Agreement, it can terminate this Agreement by a
written notice to the other that it is terminating this
Agreement.

party will have any further rights or obligations under this
Agreement other than the obligations under this Section 6.3,
Section 9.1 and the last two sentences of each of
Sections 9.4(a) and 9.4(b). Nothing contained

in this Section 6.3(a) will, however, relieve either party
of liability for any material breach of this Agreement which
occurs before this Agreement is terminated.

(b)  In the event of termination of this Agreement by
either party pursuant to Section 6.1(f) or by Pulte
pursuant to Section 6.1(g), if the stockholders of the
Company fail to adopt this Agreement and approve the Merger at
the Companys Merger Stockholders Meeting, then so long as
at the time of such termination Pulte is not in material breach
of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement contained
herein, the Company shall make payment to Pulte (within five
business days of notice of demand for payment), by wire transfer

either party pursuant to Section 6.1(f) or by the Company

Section 6.3(b), and prior to the Companys Merger
Stockholders Meeting a Company Acquisition Proposal has been
publicly announced, disclosed or communicated and within twelve
months of the termination referred to in Section 6.3(b) the
Company shall consummate or enter into any agreement with
respect to a Company Acquisition Proposal that would result in a
transaction more favorable to the Companys stockholders
from a financial point of view than the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, then the Company shall make
payment to Pulte (within five business days of notice of demand
for payment) by wire transfer of immediately available funds of
a termination fee in the amount of $32 million.

(e)  In the event of termination of this Agreement by the
Company pursuant to Section 6.1(i), so long as at the time

Company and Pulte will each pay its own expenses (and Pulte will
pay Acquisitions expenses) in connection with the
transactions which are the subject of this Agreement, including
legal fees.

9.2  Employee Benefit Plans. Pulte agrees to consult with
the senior executive officers of the Company between the date of
this Agreement and the Merger Date to develop employee benefit
plans (which may be continuations of some or all of the
Companys current employee benefit plans) which will
provide the Companys employees with benefits which are
substantially the same, in the aggregate, as those they are
receiving under the Companys employee benefit plans which
exist at the date of this Agreement and to maintain those plans
in effect for at least one year. The Surviving Corporation will
fulfill the obligations of the Company under its severance plan.

all pre-existing conditions, exclusions and waiting periods with
respect to participation and coverage requirements (to the same
extent such waivers were given prior to the Effective Time)
applicable to employees of the Surviving Corporation (New
Employees) under any employee benefit plans in which such
employees may be eligible to participate after the Effective
Time, or take such other steps as may be necessary to prevent
New Employees from incurring a loss of benefits under any
employee welfare benefit plan (as defined in Section 3(1)
of ERISA) solely as a result of this transaction; (B) to
the extent possible under applicable plan documents, and subject
to the requirements and limitations of applicable insurers,
provide each New Employee with credit for any co-payments and
deductibles paid prior to the Effective Time (to the same extent
such credit was given prior to the Effective Time) in satisfying
any applicable deductible or out-of-pocket requirements under
any employee benefit plans in which such employees may be
eligible to participate after the Effective Time, and
(C) recognize all service of New Employees with the
Company, for all purposes (including without limitation, for
purposes of eligibility to participate, vesting credit,
entitlement to benefits, and benefit accrual (including vacation
benefit accrual)) in any employee benefit plan in which such
employees may be eligible to participate after the Effective
Time; provided, that the foregoing shall not apply to the extent
it would result in duplication of benefits with respect to the
same period of service without offset for benefits accrued under
a predecessor plan.

9.3  Directors and Officers Insurance and
Indemnification.

(a)  Pulte and the Surviving Corporation will at all times
after the Effective Time indemnify and hold harmless each person
who is at the date of this Agreement, or has been at any time
prior to the date of this Agreement, a director, officer or
employee of the Company or any of its subsidiaries
(Indemnified Parties), in each case to the fullest
extent permitted by applicable law, with respect to any claim,
liability, loss, damage, cost or expense (whenever asserted or
claimed) based in whole or in part, or arising in whole or in
part out of, any act or omission by that person at or prior to
the Effective Time in connection with that persons duties
as a director, officer or employee of the Company or any of its
subsidiaries or affiliates, to the same extent and on the same
terms (including with respect to advancement of expenses)
provided in the Companys Certificate of Incorporation or
By-Laws, or in any indemnification agreements, in effect on the
date of this Agreement. Pulte or the Surviving Corporation will
pay all reasonable expenses, including attorneys fees,
that may be incurred by any Indemnified Party in enforcing the
indemnity and other obligations of Pulte and the Surviving
Corporation under this Section 9.3(a).

(b)  Pulte will cause the Surviving Corporation to keep in
effect for at least six years after the Effective Time the
policies of directors and officers liability
insurance maintained by the Company and its subsidiaries at the
date of this Agreement; provided that (i) Pulte may
substitute policies having the same coverage and amounts and
containing terms and conditions which are no less advantageous
to the persons who are currently covered by the Companys
policies and with carriers comparable in terms of credit
worthiness to those which have written the policies maintained
by the Company at the date of this Agreement and
(ii) neither Pulte nor the Surviving Corporation will be
required to pay an annual premium for that insurance in excess
of three times the annual premium relating to the year during
which this Agreement is executed, but if they are not

able to maintain the required insurance for an annual premium
for that amount, they will purchase as much coverage as they can
obtain for that amount.

9.4  Access to Properties, Books and Records.

(a)  From the date of this Agreement until the Effective

of their respective properties, books and records. Pulte will,
and will cause its representatives to, hold all information it

their respective properties, books and records. The Company
will, and will cause its representatives to, hold all

with each other before issuing any press release or otherwise
making any public statement with respect to this Agreement or

such court or from any legal process commenced in such courts
(whether through service of notice, attachment prior to

of judgment or otherwise), and (c) to the fullest extent
permitted by applicable law, that (i) the suit, action or
proceeding in any such court is brought in an inconvenient
forum, (ii) the venue of such suit, action or proceeding is

be entitled to specific performance of the terms hereof, this
being in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled
at law or in equity.

Company shall take all such steps as may be required to provide
that, with respect to each Section 16 Affiliate (as defined

[LETTERHEAD OF SALOMON SMITH BARNEY INC.]

April 30, 2001

The Board of Directors

Pulte Corporation

33 Bloomfield Hills Parkway, Suite 200

Bloomfield Hills, Michigan 48304

Members of the Board:

You have requested our opinion as to the fairness, from a
financial point of view, to Pulte Corporation
(Pulte) of the Exchange Ratio (defined below)
provided for in the Plan and Agreement of Merger, dated as of
April 30, 2001 (the Merger Agreement), among
Del Webb Corporation (Del Webb), Pulte and Pulte
Acquisition Corporation, a wholly owned subsidiary of Pulte
(Merger Sub). As more fully described in the Merger
Agreement, (a) Merger Sub will be merged with and into Del
Webb (the Merger) and (b) each outstanding
share of the common stock, par value $0.001 per share, of Del
Webb (Del Webb Common Stock) will be converted into
the right to receive that number of shares of the common stock,
par value $0.01 per share, of Pulte (Pulte Common
Stock) determined as follows (the number of shares of
Pulte Common Stock into which each share of Del Webb Common
Stock will be so converted, the Exchange Ratio):
(i) if the average of the last sale price of a share of
Pulte Common Stock as reported on the New York Stock Exchange,
Inc. (NYSE) consolidated tape for the fifteen NYSE
trading days ending on and including the third NYSE trading day
prior to the day of the meeting at which the stockholders of Del
Webb vote upon the Merger (the Market Value) is less
than $30.00, the Exchange Ratio will be 1.1, (ii) if the
Market Value of a share of Pulte Common Stock is equal to or
greater than $30.00 but less than $33.00, the Exchange Ratio
will be a number of shares of Pulte Common Stock equal to $33.00
divided by the Market Value of each share of Pulte Common Stock,
(iii) if the Market Value of a share of Pulte Common Stock
is equal to or greater than $33.00 but less than $39.00, the
Exchange Ratio will be 1.0, (iv) if the Market Value of a
share of Pulte Common Stock is equal to or greater than $39.00
but less than $45.04, the Exchange Ratio will be a number of
shares of Pulte Common Stock equal to $39.00 divided by the
Market Value of each share of Pulte Common Stock and (v) if
the Market Value of a share of Pulte Common Stock is equal to or
greater than $45.04, the Exchange Ratio will be 0.866.

In arriving at our opinion, we reviewed the Merger Agreement and
held discussions with certain senior officers, directors and
other representatives and advisors of Pulte and certain senior
officers and other representatives and advisors of Del Webb
concerning the businesses, operations and prospects of Pulte and
Del Webb. We examined certain publicly available business and
financial information relating to Pulte and Del Webb as well as
certain financial forecasts and other information and data
relating to Pulte and Del Webb which were provided to or
otherwise discussed with us by the respective managements of
Pulte and Del Webb, including certain information relating to
the potential strategic implications and operational benefits
anticipated by the managements of Pulte and Del Webb to result
from the Merger. We reviewed the financial terms of the Merger
as set forth in the Merger Agreement in relation to, among other
things: current and historical market prices and trading volumes
of Pulte Common Stock and Del Webb Common Stock; the historical
and projected earnings and other operating data of Pulte and Del
Webb; and the capitalization and financial condition of Pulte
and Del Webb. We considered, to the extent publicly available,
the financial terms of other transactions effected which we
considered relevant in evaluating the Merger and analyzed
certain financial, stock market and other publicly available
information relating to the businesses of other companies whose
operations we considered relevant in evaluating those of Pulte
and Del Webb. We also evaluated the potential pro forma
financial impact of the Merger on Pulte. In addition to the
foregoing, we conducted such other analyses and examinations and
considered such other financial, economic and market criteria as
we deemed appropriate in arriving at our opinion.

The Board or Directors

Pulte Corporation

In rendering our opinion, we have assumed and relied, without
independent verification, upon the accuracy and completeness of
all financial and other information and data publicly available
or furnished to or otherwise reviewed by or discussed with us.
With respect to financial forecasts and other information and
data relating to Pulte and Del Webb provided to or otherwise
discussed with us, we have been advised by the managements of
Pulte and Del Webb that such forecasts and other information and
data were reasonably prepared on bases reflecting the best
currently available estimates and judgments of the managements
of Pulte and Del Webb as to the future financial performance of
Pulte and Del Webb and the potential strategic implications and
operational benefits (including the amount, timing and
achievability thereof) anticipated to result from the Merger. We
also have assumed, with your consent, that the Merger will be
treated as a tax-free reorganization for federal income tax
purposes. Our opinion, as set forth herein, relates to the
relative values of Pulte and Del Webb. We are not expressing any
opinion as to what the value of the Pulte Common Stock actually
will be when issued in the Merger or the prices at which the
Pulte Common Stock will trade or otherwise be transferable
subsequent to the Merger. We have not made or been provided with
an independent evaluation or appraisal of the assets or
liabilities (contingent or otherwise) of Pulte or Del Webb nor
have we made any physical inspection of the properties or assets
of Pulte or Del Webb. Our opinion does not address the relative
merits of the Merger as compared to any alternative business
strategies that might exist for Pulte or the effect of any other
transaction in which Pulte might engage. Our opinion is
necessarily based upon information available to us, and
financial, stock market and other conditions and circumstances
existing and disclosed to us, as of the date hereof.

Salomon Smith Barney Inc. has acted as financial advisor to
Pulte in connection with the proposed Merger and will receive a
fee for such services, a significant portion of which is
contingent upon the consummation of a Merger. We also will
receive a fee upon delivery of this opinion. We and our
affiliates in the past have provided services to Del Webb
unrelated to the proposed Merger, for which services we and such
affiliates have received compensation. In the ordinary course of
our business, we and our affiliates may actively trade or hold
the securities of Pulte and Del Webb for our own account or for
the account of our customers and, accordingly, may at any time
hold a long or short position in such securities. In addition,
we and our affiliates (including Citigroup Inc. and its
affiliates) may maintain relationships with Pulte, Del Webb and
their respective affiliates.

Our advisory services and the opinion expressed herein are
provided for the information of the Board of Directors of Pulte
in its evaluation of the proposed Merger, and our opinion is not
intended to be and does not constitute a recommendation to any
stockholder as to how such stockholder should vote or act on any
matter relating to the Merger.

Based upon and subject to the foregoing, our experience as
investment bankers, our work as described above and other
factors we deemed relevant, we are of the opinion that, as of
the date hereof, the Exchange Ratio is fair, from a financial
point of view, to Pulte.

Very truly yours,

/s/ SALOMON SMITH BARNEY INC.

ANNEX III

[CREDIT SUISSE FIRST BOSTON LETTERHEAD]

April 30, 2001

Board of Directors

Del Webb Corporation

6011 North 24th Street

Phoenix, AZ 85016

Gentlemen:

You have asked us to advise you with respect to the fairness to
the stockholders of Del Webb Corporation (the
Company) from a financial point of view of the
Exchange Ratio pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement,
dated as of April 30, 2001 (the Merger
Agreement), among the Company, Pulte Corporation (the
Acquiror) and Pulte Acquisition Corporation (the
Sub). The Merger Agreement provides for the merger
(the Merger) of the Sub with and into the Company
pursuant to which the Company will become a wholly owned
subsidiary of the Acquiror.

Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, each outstanding share of
common stock, par value $0.001 per share, of the Company
(Company Common Stock) will be converted into the
right to receive the number of shares of common stock, par value
$0.01 per share, of the Acquiror (Acquiror Common
Stock) equal to the Exchange Ratio. Pursuant to the Merger
Agreement, the Exchange Ratio will be determined as follows. If
the Market Value (as defined below) of a share of Acquiror
Common Stock is equal to or greater than $33.00 but less than
$39.00, the Exchange Ratio will be one share of Acquiror Common
Stock for each share of Company Common Stock. If the Market
Value of a share of Acquiror Common Stock is equal to or greater
than $39.00 but less than $45.04, the Exchange Ratio for each
share of Company Common Stock will be the number of shares of
Acquiror Common Stock equal to $39.00 divided by the Market
Value of a share of Acquiror Common Stock. If the Market Value
of a share of Acquiror Common Stock is equal to or greater than
$45.04, the Exchange Ratio will be 0.866 shares of Acquiror
Common Stock for each share of Company Common Stock. If the
Market Value of a share of Acquiror Common Stock is equal to or
greater than $30.00 but less than $33.00, the Exchange Ratio for
each share of Company Common Stock will be the number of shares
of Acquiror Common Stock equal to $33.00 divided by the Market
Value of a share of Acquiror Common Stock. If the Market Value
of a share of Acquiror Common Stock is less than $30.00, the
Exchange Ratio will be 1.1 shares of Acquiror Common Stock for
each share of Company Common Stock. Pursuant to the Merger
Agreement, the Market Value of a share of Acquiror
Common Stock will be the average of the last sale price of a
share of Acquiror Common Stock reported on the New York Stock
Exchange (NYSE) consolidated tape for the fifteen
trading days ending on and including the third NYSE trading day
prior to the day of the meeting at which the stockholders of the
Company vote on the Merger.

In arriving at our opinion, we have reviewed certain publicly
available business and financial information relating to the
Company and the Acquiror, as well as the Merger Agreement. We
have also reviewed certain other information, including
financial forecasts, provided to us by the Company and the
Acquiror, and have met with the Companys and the
Acquirors management to discuss the business and prospects
of the Company and the Acquiror.

We have also considered certain financial and stock market data
of the Company and the Acquiror, and we have compared those data
with similar data for other publicly held companies in
businesses similar to the Company and the Acquiror and we have
considered the financial terms of certain other business
combinations and other transactions which have recently been
effected. We also considered such other information, financial
studies, analyses and investigations and financial, economic and
market criteria which we deemed relevant.

In connection with our review, we have not assumed any
responsibility for independent verification of any of the
foregoing information and have relied on its being complete and
accurate in all material respects. With

respect to the financial forecasts, with your consent we have
assumed that they have been reasonably prepared on bases
reflecting the best currently available estimates and judgments
of the Companys and the Acquirors management as to
the future financial performance of the Company and the Acquiror
and as to the cost savings and other potential synergies
(including the amount, timing and achievability thereof)
anticipated to result from the Merger. You also have informed
us, and we have assumed, that the Merger will be treated as a
tax-free reorganization for federal income tax purposes. In
addition, we have not been requested to make, and have not made,
an independent evaluation or appraisal of the assets or
liabilities (contingent or otherwise) of the Company or the
Acquiror, nor have we been furnished with any such evaluations
or appraisals. Our opinion is necessarily based upon information
available to us and financial, economic, market and other
conditions as they exist and can be evaluated on the date
hereof. We are not expressing any opinion as to the actual value
of the Acquiror Common Stock when issued to the Companys
stockholders pursuant to the Merger or the prices at which such
Acquiror Common Stock will trade at any time. We were not
requested to, and did not, solicit third party indications of
interest in acquiring all or any part of the Company.

We have acted as financial advisor to the Company in connection
with the Merger and will receive a fee for our services, a
significant portion of which is contingent upon the consummation
of the Merger. We will also receive a fee for rendering this
opinion. In the past, we have provided certain investment
banking services to the Company for which we have received
compensation. In the ordinary course of our business, we and our
affiliates may actively trade the debt and equity securities of
both the Company and the Acquiror for our and such
affiliates own accounts and for the accounts of customers
and, accordingly, may at any time hold a long or short position
in such securities.

It is understood that this letter is for the information of
Board of Directors in connection with its consideration of the
Merger and does not constitute a recommendation to any
stockholder as to how such stockholder should vote with respect
to any matter relating to the Merger.

Based upon and subject to the foregoing, it is our opinion that,
as of the date hereof, the Exchange Ratio pursuant to the Merger
Agreement is fair to the stockholders of the Company from a
financial point of view.

                  Re:  Registration Statement on Form S-4 (File No. 333-62518)

Ladies and Gentlemen:

                  We have acted as special counsel to Del Webb Corporation, a
Delaware corporation (the "Company"), in connection with the preparation of a
Registration Statement on Form S-4 (File No. 333-62518) filed with the
Securities and Exchange Commission (the "Commission") on June 7, 2001, as
amended (the "Registration Statement"), with respect to the Plan and Agreement
of Merger dated as of April 30, 2001 (the "Agreement"), among Pulte Homes, Inc.,
a Michigan corporation ("Pulte"), Pulte Acquisition Corporation, a Delaware
corporation and a direct wholly-owned subsidiary of Pulte ("Sub"), and the
Company. All capitalized terms used herein, unless otherwise specified herein,
shall have the meanings ascribed to them in the Agreement.

                  In rendering the opinion set forth herein, we have examined
and relied on originals or copies, certified or otherwise identified to our
satisfaction, of (i) the Agreement, (ii) the Registration Statement, and (iii)
such other documents, certificates, and records as we have deemed necessary or
appropriate as a basis for the

Del Webb Corporation
June 22, 2001
Page 2

opinion set forth herein. We have assumed that the Merger will be consummated in
accordance with the Agreement.

                  For purposes of our opinion, we have assumed the legal
capacity of all natural persons, the genuineness of all signatures, the
authenticity of all documents submitted to us as originals, the conformity to
original documents of all documents submitted to us as certified, conformed or
photostatic copies, and the authenticity of the originals of such latter
documents. We have assumed that the Agreement and such other documents,
certificates, and records are duly authorized, valid, and enforceable.

                  In rendering our opinion, we have relied upon statements and
representations of officers and other representatives of Pulte, Sub, and the
Company, and we have assumed that such statements and representations are and
will continue to be correct without regard to any qualification as to knowledge
or belief. In addition, our opinion is subject to the qualifications,
conditions, and assumptions in the discussion set forth under the heading
"United States Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger" in the
Registration Statement.

                  Our opinion is based on the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as
amended (the "Code"), Treasury regulations promulgated thereunder, judicial
decisions, published positions of the Internal Revenue Service, and such other
authorities as we have considered relevant, all as in effect on the date of this
opinion and all of which are subject to change or differing interpretations
(possibly with retroactive effect). A change in the authorities upon which our
opinion is based could affect the conclusions expressed herein. There can be no
assurance, moreover, that our opinion will be accepted by the Internal Revenue
Service or, if challenged, by a court. This opinion may not apply to Del Webb
common stock received pursuant to the exercise of an employee stock option, or
otherwise as compensation.

                  Based upon and subject to the foregoing, we are of the opinion
that for United States federal income tax purposes:

                  1. The Merger will constitute a "reorganization" within the
meaning of section 368(a) of the Code.

                  2. No gain or loss will be recognized by holders of Pulte
common shares as a result of the Merger.

Del Webb Corporation
June 22, 2001
Page 3

                  3. No gain or loss will be recognized by a holder of Del Webb
common stock who exchanges all of his, her or its shares of Del Webb common
stock solely for Pulte common shares pursuant to the Merger (except with respect
to cash received in lieu of a fractional share interest).

                  4. The aggregate tax basis of the Pulte common shares received
by a holder of Del Webb common stock pursuant to the Merger will be equal to the
aggregate tax basis of the Del Webb common stock surrendered in the Merger
(other than tax basis allocable to a fractional share of Pulte common shares for
which cash is received).

                  5. The holding period of the Pulte common shares received
pursuant to the Merger will include the holding period of the Del Webb common
stock surrendered in the Merger.

                  6. A holder of Del Webb common stock will be required to
recognize gain or loss with respect to cash received in lieu of a fractional
Pulte common share, measured by the difference between the amount of cash
received and the portion of the tax basis of the holder's shares of Del Webb
common stock allocable to the fractional share, which gain or loss will be
capital gain or loss if the holder of the Del Webb common stock holds such stock
as a capital asset within the meaning of section 1221 of the Code and will be
long-term capital gain or loss if the shares of Del Webb common stock exchanged
for the fractional share were held for more than one year at the Effective Time.

                  7. No gain or loss will be recognized by Del Webb, Pulte or
Sub as a result of the Merger.

                  Except as set forth above, we express no other opinion. This
opinion is expressed as of the date hereof, and we disclaim any undertaking to
advise you of subsequent changes relating to matters considered herein or of any
subsequent changes in applicable law.

                  We hereby consent to the filing of this opinion as Exhibit 8.1
to the Registration Statement. We also consent to the use of our name under the
headings "United States Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger" and
"Legal Matters" in the Registration Statement. In giving this consent, we do not
thereby
